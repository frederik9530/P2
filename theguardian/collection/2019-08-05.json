In an interview broadcast on Monday, Bolsonaro said he hoped Congress would approve his controversial plans to expand the so-called excludente de ilicitude \u2013 an article in Brazil\u2019s criminal code that makes some normally illegal acts permissible. Activists fear that could cause a bloodbath, but Bolsonaro claimed it would provide much-needed \u201clegal cover\u201d to police officers who used lethal force in the line of duty and bring a \u201cdramatic\u201d drop in violence. \u201cThese guys [criminals] are going to die in the streets like cockroaches [if such protections are approved] \u2013 and that\u2019s how it should be,\u201d he said. Bolsonaro argued Brazilian police were fighting an \u201cunequal\u201d battle against crime and should be decorated for using their guns, not taken to court. \u201cUpstanding citizens\u201d also deserved protection if they needed to use lethal force to protect their lives or properties. The remarks, inflammatory even by Bolsonarian standards, were applauded by supporters but sparked outrage among campaigners and the opposition. \u201cThese are abhorrent comments,\u201d said Ariel de Castro Alves, a veteran human rights activist and lawyer in S\u00e3o Paulo. Alves claimed Bolsonaro\u2019s truculent and dehumanising discourse had already caused a spike in deadly police violence \u2013 largely against poor, young, black men \u2013 and feared the planned legislation would make things even worse. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 414 killings committed by military police in S\u00e3o Paulo [in the first half of 2019] \u2013 that is the highest number since 2003 \u2026 He is encouraging police violence and ends up serving as a kind of instigator of brutality,\u201d Alves said. Robert Muggah, the head of a Brazilian thinktank the Igarap\u00e9 Institute, said there had been a similar spike in slayings in Rio de Janeiro where police gunned down 434 people in the first three months of 2019. \u201cThis is the highest number recorded in over two decades,\u201d Muggah said. In the first six months of this year Rio police reportedly killed 881 people \u2013 or one person every five hours. \u201cOur concern is that this kind of rhetoric can encourage police to deploy more excessive force and could result, in fact, in more police violence than is currently the case,\u201d Muggah added. \u201cThis is clearly a concern in a country that already registers the highest absolute amount of lethal violence and some of the highest levels of police killings in the world.\u201d Last year Brazilian police killed nearly 6,200 people compared to 5,225 in 2017, official figures show.",

Macquarie Group announced on Friday its agricultural fund had acquired a 49% interest in Cubbie station, located in the Murray-Darling Basin food bowl. David Speirs\u2019 2018 parliamentary register of interests show he has an investment in Macquarie Group. The South Australia\u2019s Legislative Assembly clerk\u2019s office has not yet received Speirs\u2019 2019 disclosure, which is due by the end of the month. The minister bought shares in Macquarie in 2015, according to his register of interests for that year. In March 2018 Speirs divested shares in other companies including Crown Resorts, Oil Search, Aurizon Limited and Iluka Resources. Speirs, who is also environment minister, took part in a ministerial meeting in Canberra on Sunday concerning the Murray-Darling Basin plan along with his counterparts from Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the federal government. Cubbie station is 93,000 hectares and the largest irrigation property in the southern hemisphere. The south-west Queensland cotton farm has a water storage capacity equal to Sydney Harbour. In a good year, Cubbie has the capacity to grow 330,000 bales of cotton as well as wheat, barley, sorghum and corn. Shareholder activist Stephen Mayne, who owns three shares in Macquarie and attended the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Sydney last week, urged Speirs to disclose how many shares he owns. \u201cIt\u2019s a perception problem \u2026 He should immediately divest the shares,\u201d Mayne told Guardian Australia. Mayne said the \u201coptics do not look good\u201d and it could put a \u201ccloud over his decision-making\u201d. It was a safe option for politicians not to invest in Macquarie Group because it was such a \u201chuge beast\u201d and had had lots of different interests over the years ranging from toll roads to airports and taxi licences, Mayne said. Speirs said he was unaware of Macquarie\u2019s Cubbie station announcement until Monday afternoon. \u201cSince becoming aware of the purchase I sought advice and I do not believe there is a conflict of interest,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, to ensure there is no misunderstanding moving forward I have decided to divest these shares.\u201d A spokeswoman for South Australia\u2019s premier, Steven Marshall, declined to comment. The state\u2019s ministerial code of conduct says: \u201cMinisters should avoid situations in which their private interests conflict, have the potential to conflict or appear to conflict with their public duty. \u201cA conflict of interest does not only encompass actual or direct conflicts of interest between a minister\u2019s public duty and private interests.

      "bodyText": "Facebook has been accused of failing to stop the sale of fake reviews through its website, more than a month after it was told to crack down on the issue by a UK regulator. An investigation by Which? found that despite concerns raised by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Facebook continued to be flooded with fake review groups that try to deceive customers. The consumer group urged the CMA to take enforcement action against Facebook. It estimated there are be hundreds of groups recruiting writers for fake or incentivised reviews. Which? researchers joined scores of Facebook review groups during its investigation and found 3,511 new posts had been generated in just one day \u2013 and more than 55,000 in a month. In June, the CMA told Facebook and eBay to conduct an urgent review after it found \u201ctroubling evidence\u201d of a thriving marketplace for fake online reviews. Which? said the platforms were told to remove and prevent these groups from reappearing. EBay seemed to have largely eradicated listings offering five-star reviews for sale The number of groups still rife on Facebook raised serious concerns about the effectiveness of its attempts to tackle the growing problem, Which? said. Natalie Hitchins, the head of products and services at the consumer group, said: \u201cOur latest findings demonstrate that Facebook has systematically failed to take action while its platform continues to be plagued with fake review groups generating thousands of posts a day. \u201cIt is deeply concerning that the company continues to leave customers exposed to poor quality or unsafe products boosted by misleading and disingenuous reviews. Facebook must immediately take steps to not only address the groups that are reported to it, but proactively identify and shut down other groups.\u201d A Facebook spokesperson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t allow people to use Facebook to facilitate or encourage false reviews. We have removed nine of the 10 groups Which? reported to us and are investigating the remaining group. \u201cWe continue to improve our tools to prevent this kind of abuse, including investing in technology and increasing the size of our safety and security team to 30,000.\u201d George Lusty, the senior director of consumer protection at the CMA, described the Which? revelations as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. He said: \u201cFacebook must take effective steps to deal with this problem by quickly removing the material and stop it from resurfacing. \u201cThis is just the start \u2013 we\u2019ll be doing more to tackle fake and misleading online reviews.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The richest 1% in Britain have become increasingly concentrated in London over the past two decades, according to research that underlines the rise of inequality between the capital and the rest of the country. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said London had increased the proportion of top 1% highest income tax payers who live there by a fifth since the early 2000s, marking a growing concentration of income. Finding that the top 1% highest earners in the country are overwhelmingly middle-aged men living in London and the south-east, the thintank said the super-rich bunching together could distort their views on wealth. Robert Joyce, deputy director at the IFS, said: \u201cThis geographic and demographic concentration may be one reason why many of those on high incomes don\u2019t realise quite how much higher their incomes are than the average.\u201d In a sign of the capital\u2019s rising affluence compared with other parts of the country in the years since the turn of the millennium, London\u2019s share of the top 1% had risen to 35% in 2014-15 from 29% in 2000-01. More than half of the country\u2019s top 1% live in London and the south-east, clustering together in as few as 65 parliamentary constituencies, compared with 78 at the start of the 2000s. The findings come amid growing concerns over the rise of inequality in Britain over recent decades. Coupled with austerity and stagnant wage growth after inflation for average workers, inequality is viewed as being among key drivers for the country\u2019s polarised political debate and among the reasons for the Brexit vote. The IFS said it took an income of about \u00a3100,000 to be considered among the top 1% of high earners in Wales, the north-east and Northern Ireland. However, in London it was more than \u00a3300,000 a year. In a sign of the extreme levels of wealth in the capital, it said a 50-year-old man in London with an income of \u00a3160,000 would earn enough to be in the top 1% for the rest of the country, but would not even be in the top 5% of men living in London. Men make up 83% of the top 1% of income tax payers and 89% of the top 0.1%. To be among the top 1% of men requires an income of \u00a3200,000, while to be in the highest 1% income bracket for women would need half of that.",

For his birthday, Jack\u2019s parents gave him a lavish party in his dad\u2019s restaurant, and a Rolex watch made the year he was born (canny: a 1999 Rolex Submariner can be had for as little as \u00a37,500).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/06/how-nigella-lawson-changed-food-writing\">Kitchen revolution: how Nigella Lawson changed food writing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jack was privately educated at Dulwich College, one of the UK\u2019s most expensive schools. He works out with a personal trainer in the basement gym of his parents\u2019 enormous London home. In his bedroom, he stores mementos of \u201csuper special\u201d times: ringside tickets for title fights, skydiving certificates, that sort of thing. \u201cJack wasn\u2019t born with a silver spoon,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cIf I had to compare his upbringing with my upbringing, he was born on a silver tray.\u201d</p> <p>Gordon, by contrast, had a tough, itinerant childhood; in his teens he was living on the Bretch Hill estate in Banbury, Oxfordshire, a place he describes as \u201cnotorious\u201d. He seemed gleefully certain that his pampered, clueless son wouldn\u2019t survive a minute there \u2013 that it would be a real wake-up call \u2013 although at times it was the father who seemed more out of touch. \u201cUber don\u2019t go to Bretch Hill!\u201d he shouted. It is undoubtedly a deprived and under-resourced part of Oxfordshire, but I\u2019m pretty certain Uber does go to Bretch Hill. I checked the prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5e3de199a387e400ef860170a28662ebd89eb11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5e3de199a387e400ef860170a28662ebd89eb11/0_137_2383_1428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack and Gordon Ramsay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack and Gordon Ramsay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Dearing/CHANNEL 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ramsay\u2019s reasons for sending his son to the neighbourhood where he grew up were typically bluntly expressed. \u201cJack needs to get dropped in the shit to get his shit together,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But here is a reason nobody mentioned: Born Famous is made by Ramsay\u2019s own production company, Studio Ramsay. Even Jack\u2019s ostensible journey into deprivation is just another privilege \u2013 a chance to front a TV show produced by his dad.</p> <p>Jack seems like a very nice fellow: softly spoken, helpful, polite. He hit it off with his Bretch Hill counterpart \u2013 George, a sofa-surfing teen desperately in need of a job and a place to sleep. But the episode was a pretty slapdash affair. The bag Jack packed for his trip in one scene was clearly not the same bag he left the house with in the next. Conversations were stilted and weirdly edited \u2013 it wasn\u2019t always clear if the answers given belonged to the questions asked.</p> <p>Jack\u2019s actual role was entirely undefined \u2013 was he the reporter, or the subject? If the former, then a scene where he appeared to oversleep, making George late for a job interview, was unforgivable. What happened next was even odder: he accompanied George to his job trial as a dishwasher, did the work alongside him and waited politely outside during the subsequent interview, even though the cameras followed George in and filmed it anyway. At times, you felt it was Jack who needed employment.</p> <p>If Ramsay Jr had no particular insights to offer into the inequality of opportunity, he wasn\u2019t really supposed to. He was only there to be gobsmacked by it all. But he never seemed that fazed \u2013 everybody was so nice to him.</p> <p>Much in evidence was the unfortunate tendency of fame to smear its influence over everything. In a Bretch Hill playground, Jack was besieged by autograph-seekers. His experience of sofa surfing \u2013 where everyone\u2019s really pleased when you turn up \u2013 was not exactly authentic. And no amount of lateness, inexperience or lack of an address can scupper a job interview that has been arranged for filming. Jack may not have discovered what it is to be poor, but Bretch Hill certainly found out what it was like to have a minor celebrity hang around by the swings for a few afternoons.</p> <p>It was, in the end, a false exercise, not helped by Gordon\u2019s subsequent refusal to accept its most basic premise: that in many ways, the young of modern Banbury have it even harder than he did. Back home (this time, the Ramsay\u2019s other family home, in Los Angeles) Jack dared to suggest that without the advantages of the youth club (now closed) and the council flat he was given after his family fractured (good luck), Ramsay Sr might not have made it out of Bretch Hill.</p> <p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cYou\u2019re talking out of your arse.\u201d Dad, I\u2019m trying to make a TV show here \u2013 work with me.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The rich and famous don\u2019t always start off that way, but their offspring usually do. In this new series (Channel 4), children of immense privilege go back to see how tough their parents had it back then. First up was Gordon Ramsay\u2019s son, Jack, who recently turned 18. For his birthday, Jack\u2019s parents gave him a lavish party in his dad\u2019s restaurant, and a Rolex watch made the year he was born (canny: a 1999 Rolex Submariner can be had for as little as \u00a37,500). Jack was privately educated at Dulwich College, one of the UK\u2019s most expensive schools. He works out with a personal trainer in the basement gym of his parents\u2019 enormous London home. In his bedroom, he stores mementos of \u201csuper special\u201d times: ringside tickets for title fights, skydiving certificates, that sort of thing. \u201cJack wasn\u2019t born with a silver spoon,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cIf I had to compare his upbringing with my upbringing, he was born on a silver tray.\u201d Gordon, by contrast, had a tough, itinerant childhood; in his teens he was living on the Bretch Hill estate in Banbury, Oxfordshire, a place he describes as \u201cnotorious\u201d. He seemed gleefully certain that his pampered, clueless son wouldn\u2019t survive a minute there \u2013 that it would be a real wake-up call \u2013 although at times it was the father who seemed more out of touch. \u201cUber don\u2019t go to Bretch Hill!\u201d he shouted. It is undoubtedly a deprived and under-resourced part of Oxfordshire, but I\u2019m pretty certain Uber does go to Bretch Hill. I checked the prices. Ramsay\u2019s reasons for sending his son to the neighbourhood where he grew up were typically bluntly expressed. \u201cJack needs to get dropped in the shit to get his shit together,\u201d he said. But here is a reason nobody mentioned: Born Famous is made by Ramsay\u2019s own production company, Studio Ramsay. Even Jack\u2019s ostensible journey into deprivation is just another privilege \u2013 a chance to front a TV show produced by his dad. Jack seems like a very nice fellow: softly spoken, helpful, polite. He hit it off with his Bretch Hill counterpart \u2013 George, a sofa-surfing teen desperately in need of a job and a place to sleep. But the episode was a pretty slapdash affair. The bag Jack packed for his trip in one scene was clearly not the same bag he left the house with in the next. Conversations were stilted and weirdly edited \u2013 it wasn\u2019t always clear if the answers given belonged to the questions asked. Jack\u2019s actual role was entirely undefined \u2013 was he the reporter, or the subject? If the former, then a scene where he appeared to oversleep, making George late for a job interview, was unforgivable. What happened next was even odder: he accompanied George to his job trial as a dishwasher, did the work alongside him and waited politely outside during the subsequent interview, even though the cameras followed George in and filmed it anyway. At times, you felt it was Jack who needed employment. If Ramsay Jr had no particular insights to offer into the inequality of opportunity, he wasn\u2019t really supposed to. He was only there to be gobsmacked by it all. But he never seemed that fazed \u2013 everybody was so nice to him. Much in evidence was the unfortunate tendency of fame to smear its influence over everything. In a Bretch Hill playground, Jack was besieged by autograph-seekers. His experience of sofa surfing \u2013 where everyone\u2019s really pleased when you turn up \u2013 was not exactly authentic. And no amount of lateness, inexperience or lack of an address can scupper a job interview that has been arranged for filming. Jack may not have discovered what it is to be poor, but Bretch Hill certainly found out what it was like to have a minor celebrity hang around by the swings for a few afternoons. It was, in the end, a false exercise, not helped by Gordon\u2019s subsequent refusal to accept its most basic premise: that in many ways, the young of modern Banbury have it even harder than he did. Back home (this time, the Ramsay\u2019s other family home, in Los Angeles) Jack dared to suggest that without the advantages of the youth club (now closed) and the council flat he was given after his family fractured (good luck), Ramsay Sr might not have made it out of Bretch Hill. \u201cBullshit,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cYou\u2019re talking out of your arse.\u201d Dad, I\u2019m trying to make a TV show here \u2013 work with me.",

He wore a grey-and-blue plaid blazer and dark pants, with slicked-back hair. While both prosecutors and defense lawyers made their arguments on sentencing, Sayoc repeatedly read over several pages of the statement he would ultimately read to Rakoff.</p> <p>\u201cI am beyond so very sorry for what I did,\u201d said Sayoc, who traced each word on the paper with his finger as he read aloud. \u201cI wish more than anything I could turn back time and take back what I did.\u201d</p> <p>While Manhattan federal court judge Jed Rakoff was not swayed by Amelkin\u2019s arguments about Trump fostering paranoia, he felt that the devices\u2019 failure to detonate spoke to Sayoc\u2019s intent.</p> <p>\u201cMr Sayoc was fully capable or concocting pipe bombs capable of exploding,\u201d Rakoff said.</p> <p>\u201cHe hated his victims,\u201d Rakoff said, but not so much as to want them dead.</p> <p>Because Sayoc did not have a murderous intent, it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d for him to impose the maximum sentence \u2013 life plus 10 years, he added.</p> <p>Sayoc, who cried as Rakoff was issuing his decision, mouthed \u201cthank you\u201d and gestured as if in prayer.</p> <p>\u201cSayoc packed each IED with explosive material and glass shards that would function as shrapnel if the IED exploded,\u201d federal prosecutors in Manhattan said. \u201cSayoc also attached to the outside of each IED a picture of the intended victim marked with a red \u2018X.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sayoc previously pleaded guilty to 65 counts: 16 counts of using a weapon of mass destruction, 16 counts of interstate transportation of an explosive device, 16 counts of conveying a threat in interstate commerce, 16 counts of the illegal mailing of explosives with the intent to kill or injure another, and one count of using an explosive to commit a felony.</p> <p>The first of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-pipe-bomb-packages\">Sayoc\u2019s bombs</a> was found in 22 October 2018, in a mailbox at Soros\u2019s New York home. A bomb addressed to Bill and Hillary Clinton was found on 23 October. On 24 October, still more bombs were discovered at the offices or homes of top Democrats.</p> <p>Authorities traced the parcels to south Florida. They arrested him in late October. At the time of Sayoc\u2019s arrest, he was living in a van that was covered with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/26/cesar-sayoc-who-is-he-pro-trump-pipe-bomb-suspect-criminal-record-party-affiliation\">images of Trump</a> and Vice-President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence\">Mike Pence</a>.

A fanatical Trump supporter, Sayoc was also a former bodybuilder and male exotic dancer. He sent 16 crude explosives to 13 intended victims across the US, prosecutors said. None of the bombs, which prosecutors called \u201cimprovised explosive devices\u201d, exploded. Sayoc\u2019s targets included the former vice-president Joe Biden, senator and Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Cory Booker, former CIA director John Brennan, former national intelligence director James Clapper, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the New York offices of cable news network CNN, actor Robert De Niro, Democratic senator and 2020 candidate Kamala Harris, former attorney general Eric Holder, former US president Barack Obama, billionaire liberal philanthropist George Soros, Democrat presidential candidate Tom Steyer and US congresswoman Maxine Walters. Sayoc\u2019s defense lawyers urged the court to give him the minimum sentence of 10 years, describing him as a troubled man who hit a breaking point after years of untreated mental health issues and steroid addiction. As his life declined, they argued, the penniless Sayoc turned to spiritual candles and self-help books \u2013 including Trump\u2019s writing. \u201cThe books by Donald Trump really resonated with him,\u201d said defense lawyer Ian Marcus Amelkin. \u201cThen he kind of became obsessed with Donald Trump.\u201d Sayoc spent money on \u201cTrump-branded\u201d suits and ties. \u201cHe looked up to the president, as a father figure,\u201d Amelkin said. \u201cHe watched Fox News \u2026 he was expressing a lot of hateful ideas and conspiracy theories.\u201d The steroids, meanwhile, fostered obsession with Democratic party figures, Amelkin said. \u201cWe believe that the president\u2019s rhetoric contributed to Mr Sayoc\u2019s behavior,\u201d Amelkin said. Amelkin\u2019s invocation of Trump\u2019s rhetoric came in the wake of two mass shootings this weekend that left at least 31 dead. The shootings spurred renewed criticism of Trump\u2019s racist and anti-immigration rhetoric. Before the El Paso, Texas, shooting, which resulted in 22 deaths, the suspect allegedly posted a racist, anti-Hispanic screed online \u2013 which mirrored some of Trump\u2019s past statements. Prosecutors pushed for a life sentence arguing that Sayoc was aware of what he was doing and that 10 years would have been \u201cwholly insufficient\u201d. \u201cThe defendant created a climate of fear and terror,\u201d said prosecutor Jane Kim, later adding: \u201cPolitics cannot justify a terror attack.\u201d Sayoc, 57, was attentive throughout the proceeding. He wore a grey-and-blue plaid blazer and dark pants, with slicked-back hair. While both prosecutors and defense lawyers made their arguments on sentencing, Sayoc repeatedly read over several pages of the statement he would ultimately read to Rakoff. \u201cI am beyond so very sorry for what I did,\u201d said Sayoc, who traced each word on the paper with his finger as he read aloud. \u201cI wish more than anything I could turn back time and take back what I did.\u201d While Manhattan federal court judge Jed Rakoff was not swayed by Amelkin\u2019s arguments about Trump fostering paranoia, he felt that the devices\u2019 failure to detonate spoke to Sayoc\u2019s intent. \u201cMr Sayoc was fully capable or concocting pipe bombs capable of exploding,\u201d Rakoff said. \u201cHe hated his victims,\u201d Rakoff said, but not so much as to want them dead. Because Sayoc did not have a murderous intent, it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d for him to impose the maximum sentence \u2013 life plus 10 years, he added. Sayoc, who cried as Rakoff was issuing his decision, mouthed \u201cthank you\u201d and gestured as if in prayer. \u201cSayoc packed each IED with explosive material and glass shards that would function as shrapnel if the IED exploded,\u201d federal prosecutors in Manhattan said. \u201cSayoc also attached to the outside of each IED a picture of the intended victim marked with a red \u2018X.\u2019\u201d Sayoc previously pleaded guilty to 65 counts: 16 counts of using a weapon of mass destruction, 16 counts of interstate transportation of an explosive device, 16 counts of conveying a threat in interstate commerce, 16 counts of the illegal mailing of explosives with the intent to kill or injure another, and one count of using an explosive to commit a felony. The first of Sayoc\u2019s bombs was found in 22 October 2018, in a mailbox at Soros\u2019s New York home. A bomb addressed to Bill and Hillary Clinton was found on 23 October. On 24 October, still more bombs were discovered at the offices or homes of top Democrats. Authorities traced the parcels to south Florida. They arrested him in late October. At the time of Sayoc\u2019s arrest, he was living in a van that was covered with images of Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence. There were also images of Trump\u2019s opponents showing them with crosshairs on their faces.",

The 33-year-old still has more than two seasons left on his DC United contract but Derby\u2019s owner, Mel Morris, believes Rooney could inspire a squad which went so close to promotion under Frank Lampard last season. Derby appointed the former Barcelona midfielder Phillip Cocu as manager last month on a four-year contract following Lampard\u2019s move to Chelsea. Initial talks between Derby and Rooney\u2019s agent, Paul Stretford, have taken place and Morris is expecting more discussions in the near future. The former Everton and Manchester United striker, who is England\u2019s all-time record scorer with 53 goals in 120 appearances for his country, has made little secret of his desire to move into management and would be keen on a return to England. \u201cI\u2019m taking the steps to get my badges completed and when I finish playing I\u2019ll see what opportunities come up,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThere\u2019s already offers which have been made, but at the minute I\u2019m still a player and I want to enjoy playing, and then I\u2019ll see which offers are right when I do finish.\u201d Asked if he had been contacted by clubs from England or the United States, he added: \u201cYeah, both.

The suspected Christchurch shooter, who is accused of livestreaming his murder of dozens of innocent people in New Zealand in March, appears to have inspired at least two additional mass shootings in the United States within five months. In April, another young white man opened fire at a synagogue in Poway, California, killing one woman and injuring three other people. He cited the Christchurch attacks as his model, prosecutors said. On Saturday, the manifesto linked to the El Paso shooting, too, referred to the Christchurch massacre as an explicit inspiration.</p> \n<p>\u201cToo many people still think of these attacks as single events, rather than interconnected actions,\u201d the historian Kathleen Belew, author of Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America, wrote in an opinion column on Sunday. \u201cWe spend too much ink dividing them into anti-immigrant, racist, anti-Muslim or antisemitic attacks. True, they are these things. But they are also connected with one another through a broader white power ideology.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Defining white nationalism</h2> \n<p>At the center of contemporary white nationalist ideology is the belief that whiteness is under attack, and that a wide range of enemies \u2013 from feminists to leftwing politicians to Muslims, Jews, immigrants, refugees and black people \u2013 are all conspiring to undermine and destroy the white race, through means as varied as interracial marriage, immigration, \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d and criticism of straight white men.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"54b467cc-34ab-43c7-91e3-e5337efb4466\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(July 22, 2011)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Ut\u00f8ya island and in Oslo, Norway</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>77 killed in a bomb attack, followed by a shooting targeting the island summer youth camp of Norway\u2019s Labor party.

      "bodyText": "Reports that the suspected gunman at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, saw his mass shooting as \u201ca response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas\u201d has prompted bipartisan calls for the US to treat the threat of domestic \u201cwhite terrorists\u201d as seriously as the threat of attacks by supporters of al-Qaida or Isis. But experts who study racist violence say the attack must be understood not just as a domestic problem within the United States, but as part of a global network of white nationalist radicalization and violence. The escalating global death toll from white nationalist attacks puts a spotlight on the social media companies that have allowed white nationalists to organize on their platforms with little interference, as well as on the clear parallels between white terrorists\u2019 justification for their attacks, and the racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric of some mainstream politicians. Donald Trump has repeatedly referred to immigrants and refugees as an \u201cinvasion\u201d. A global problem A \u201cmanifesto\u201d that appeared to be linked to the El Paso attack on Saturday described the growing number of Latinx people in Texas as an \u201cinvasion\u201d that threatened the political power of white residents. The shooting, which left at least 22 people dead, is being investigated by federal officials as an act of domestic terrorism. Perpetrators of other recent attacks around the world indicated that they, too, believed that white people were under attack, and that immigrants, refugees and other people of color are \u201cinvaders\u201d who put the white race at risk. The Canadian man who opened fire at a mosque in Quebec in January 2017. The American man who plowed his car into a crowd of protesters after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, later that year. The 46-year-old American who allegedly attacked a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018. The Australian man who allegedly killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, this March. Many of these attacks inspired even more acts of violence. The suspected Christchurch shooter, who is accused of livestreaming his murder of dozens of innocent people in New Zealand in March, appears to have inspired at least two additional mass shootings in the United States within five months. In April, another young white man opened fire at a synagogue in Poway, California, killing one woman and injuring three other people. He cited the Christchurch attacks as his model, prosecutors said. On Saturday, the manifesto linked to the El Paso shooting, too, referred to the Christchurch massacre as an explicit inspiration. \u201cToo many people still think of these attacks as single events, rather than interconnected actions,\u201d the historian Kathleen Belew, author of Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America, wrote in an opinion column on Sunday. \u201cWe spend too much ink dividing them into anti-immigrant, racist, anti-Muslim or antisemitic attacks. True, they are these things. But they are also connected with one another through a broader white power ideology.\u201d Defining white nationalism At the center of contemporary white nationalist ideology is the belief that whiteness is under attack, and that a wide range of enemies \u2013 from feminists to leftwing politicians to Muslims, Jews, immigrants, refugees and black people \u2013 are all conspiring to undermine and destroy the white race, through means as varied as interracial marriage, immigration, \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d and criticism of straight white men. To people who believe in white supremacist conspiracies, demographic change is an \u201cexistential threat to white people\u201d, said Cynthia Miller-Idriss, a professor of education and sociology at the American University, and a senior fellow at the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right. These conspiracy theories refer to demographic shifts in dramatic, violent terms, as a kind of \u201cgenocide\u201d or a \u201cgreat replacement\u201d of one people with another. The idea of \u201creplacement\u201d is central to this movement: \u201cYou will not replace us! Jews will not replace us!\u201d white nationalists and neo-Nazis chanted as they marched with flaming torches through Charlottesville, Virginia. It has echoed in the manifestos of mass murderers, and the chants of Charlottesville marchers, since being coined by a French white nationalist writer and conspiracy theorist in 2011. But in many of the countries where white nationalist radicalization is a threat \u2013 including the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 white people are, in fact, not the native population, and are not being displaced. Despite this, recent racist violence in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Europe, is linked by the shared conspiracy that \u201cwhite people are being displaced from their home countries\u201d, said Heidi Beirich, the intelligence director at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an organization that monitors American hate groups. \u201cAt the extreme end of white supremacy you have this group of people who believe that the only way to create change is to create a violent societal collapse, that will lead to apocalyptic end times, and a race war, and then eventually to restoration and rebirth,\u201d Miller-Idriss said. Attacks closely linked to mainstream politics Though antisemitism is at the heart of white nationalist conspiracy theories, many different groups are labeled as enemies. In the past decade, deadly attacks linked to white nationalism have been carried out against Muslims, Jews, African Americans at Bible study in a historic black church, leftwing activists and politicians in the United States and across Europe. More than 175 people have been killed in at least 16 high-profile attacks linked to white nationalism around the world since 2011. And although politicians often label white nationalist violence as \u201csenseless\u201d, analysts suggest that hate crimes often spike alongside political events like elections. Many of these \u201csenseless\u201d attacks have been carried out during key moments of mainstream political debates over immigration and refugee policy. Jo Cox, a British member of parliament, was assassinated by a far-right extremist in June 2016, in the run-up to the Brexit referendum. Pro-Brexit campaigners claimed at the time that voting to remain in the European Union would would result in \u201cswarms\u201d of immigrants entering the UK, and that it would prompt mass sexual attacks. Cox\u2019s killer shouted \u201cBritain first!\u201d as he shot and stabbed her to death. The shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh \u2013 the worst antisemitic mass murder in US history \u2013 happened during the run up to the midterm elections. At that time, conservative media and Republican politicians were promoting fears of a \u201ccaravan\u201d of migrants heading towards the country from Central America. Congressman Matt Gaetz was one of those who suggested that the caravan had been orchestrated by the Jewish financier George Soros. Trump, who spent years questioning the citizenship of America\u2019s first black president, has continuously made public comments that include white nationalist rhetoric. He campaigned on a ban on Muslim immigration, a border wall, and in his campaign announcement suggested that Mexican migrants were rapists. As president, he has characterized migrants as invaders in several tweets. At a rally in May, Trump used the term \u201cinvasion\u201d to describe the arrival of immigrants at the southern border.

By the numbers While there are no official surveys of hate crimes in the United States, several organizations that monitor them across disparate jurisdictions and reporting standards say that crimes motivated by white supremacy have been rising in recent years. According to a report last week from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism (CSHE) at CSU San Bernardino, there were 17 homicides carried out by white nationalists in the US alone in 2018.

But the small slice of this devoted to rightwing extremists has been further diminished in the Trump era. Earlier this year DHS disbanded a group of intelligence analysts focused on domestic terror threats, after shutting down programs specifically directed at neo-Nazis and other far right groups. According to the Brookings Institution\u2019s Eric Rosand, when it comes to domestic terrorism, \u201cthe United States continues to rely almost entirely on the police\u201d. At the local level, law enforcement officials across the country have faced scrutiny for failing to take seriously the threat of white nationalist violence, and for sometimes devoting more attention to policing anti-fascist protesters than violent neo-Nazis. Some American law enforcement officials have said they were unprepared to deal with white nationalist violence. Beirich says that \u201cthe FBI has admitted that this is the number one domestic terror threat, but then at the same time federal agencies have been focused on Islamic extremism for so long they are way behind the eight ball on this\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Jamie George is enjoying one of the most successful periods of his career: a domestic and European double with Saracens complemented by the fact that, since the heartbreaking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/23/wales-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">Six Nations defeat by Wales in Cardiff</a> in February, he has not lost a match in which he has started \u2013 for either club or country. </p> <p>But the England hooker insists international rugby and the cauldron of a World Cup will require a step up even from the mindset that delivered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/01/saracens-exeter-premiership-power-final\" title=\"\">Saracens</a>\u2019 knockout rugby triumphs last season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/04/willi-heinz-makes-grand-case-for-england-role-at-world-cup\">Willi Heinz offers England a steady hand on the tiller at World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky that I play for a relatively successful club and Eddie [Jones] tries to pick our [Saracens] brains but, at the same time, it\u2019s a different environment,\u201d George says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create something similar [to Saracens], but still our own type of culture. Guys at Saracens are giving their opinions on how they think things should be run but it\u2019s a leadership group from all different clubs.\u201d</p> <p>England spent last week training in sweltering heat and humidity in Treviso, in north-eastern Italy, to experience conditions similar to those that lie ahead in Japan. While most players struggled with ball-handling in such greasy conditions, for George it was lineout throwing that provided the most strenuous challenge.</p> <p>\u201cIt was difficult. It doesn\u2019t rain too much over there but the ball does get extremely slippery so it was a different type of challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t use too many towels, so we didn\u2019t get too much opportunity to dry the balls. It was a tough challenge but one you had to get your head around.\u201d</p> <p>It has been a coming-of-age four years for George. In the summer of 2015 he had just been drafted into Stuart Lancaster\u2019s preliminary World Cup squad, replacing Dylan Hartley who was left out after picking up a ban that would have ruled him out of the opening match. George made his international debut in one of the two warmup matches in which he featured, and he came off the bench in the dead-rubber walloping of Uruguay following England\u2019s premature elimination from the competition at the pool stage.</p> <p>As Japan looms in the World Cup cycle he now has a Lions series to New Zealand under his belt, he has become a crucial cog in Saracens\u2019 domestic and European dominance, and he is now England\u2019s undisputed first-choice hooker.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. My first cap in the pre-World Cup games last time around seems a long time ago. It\u2019s an incredibly exciting time to be involved in English rugby,\u201d says the 28-year-old. \u201cThere\u2019s huge excitement and belief amongst the group that we can really do something special.\u201d</p> <p>The excitement for the World Cup \u2013 with England\u2019s first match on 22 September against Tonga \u2013 is palpable in George\u2019s every word. But, with consecutive warm-up matches against Wales to come \u2013the first on Sunday at Twickenham \u2013 he is not getting ahead of himself.</p> <p>\u201cWhenever England play Wales it is going to have an edge to it. They are Test matches, playing them home and away, and they are both amazing opportunities to put our best foot forward and right a few wrongs from that game in the Six Nations.\u201d</p> <p>To do so England need all their experienced international-class players. Thankfully for Eddie Jones the experienced loosehead prop Joe Marler, who played for the Barbarians against England at Twickenham in July, has declared himself available for selection after announcing his retirement in September last year. George knows Marler well from England duty as well as the Lions tour to New Zealand and has nothing but praise for the 29-year-old.</p> <p>\u201cWhenever Marler\u2019s around, it\u2019s always extremely entertaining. He\u2019s been amazing,\u201d George says. \u201cIt seems a long time since he left \u2013 a lot has happened. He\u2019s a joker off the field but he\u2019s a calm head on it and has a huge amount of experience. He keeps things nice and calm, adding some key points around the new scrummaging laws. He\u2019s been vital around that. He just wanted to play with me again I think!\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jamie George is enjoying one of the most successful periods of his career: a domestic and European double with Saracens complemented by the fact that, since the heartbreaking Six Nations defeat by Wales in Cardiff in February, he has not lost a match in which he has started \u2013 for either club or country. But the England hooker insists international rugby and the cauldron of a World Cup will require a step up even from the mindset that delivered Saracens\u2019 knockout rugby triumphs last season. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I play for a relatively successful club and Eddie [Jones] tries to pick our [Saracens] brains but, at the same time, it\u2019s a different environment,\u201d George says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create something similar [to Saracens], but still our own type of culture. Guys at Saracens are giving their opinions on how they think things should be run but it\u2019s a leadership group from all different clubs.\u201d England spent last week training in sweltering heat and humidity in Treviso, in north-eastern Italy, to experience conditions similar to those that lie ahead in Japan. While most players struggled with ball-handling in such greasy conditions, for George it was lineout throwing that provided the most strenuous challenge. \u201cIt was difficult. It doesn\u2019t rain too much over there but the ball does get extremely slippery so it was a different type of challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t use too many towels, so we didn\u2019t get too much opportunity to dry the balls. It was a tough challenge but one you had to get your head around.\u201d It has been a coming-of-age four years for George. In the summer of 2015 he had just been drafted into Stuart Lancaster\u2019s preliminary World Cup squad, replacing Dylan Hartley who was left out after picking up a ban that would have ruled him out of the opening match. George made his international debut in one of the two warmup matches in which he featured, and he came off the bench in the dead-rubber walloping of Uruguay following England\u2019s premature elimination from the competition at the pool stage. As Japan looms in the World Cup cycle he now has a Lions series to New Zealand under his belt, he has become a crucial cog in Saracens\u2019 domestic and European dominance, and he is now England\u2019s undisputed first-choice hooker. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. My first cap in the pre-World Cup games last time around seems a long time ago. It\u2019s an incredibly exciting time to be involved in English rugby,\u201d says the 28-year-old. \u201cThere\u2019s huge excitement and belief amongst the group that we can really do something special.\u201d The excitement for the World Cup \u2013 with England\u2019s first match on 22 September against Tonga \u2013 is palpable in George\u2019s every word. But, with consecutive warm-up matches against Wales to come \u2013the first on Sunday at Twickenham \u2013 he is not getting ahead of himself. \u201cWhenever England play Wales it is going to have an edge to it. They are Test matches, playing them home and away, and they are both amazing opportunities to put our best foot forward and right a few wrongs from that game in the Six Nations.\u201d To do so England need all their experienced international-class players. Thankfully for Eddie Jones the experienced loosehead prop Joe Marler, who played for the Barbarians against England at Twickenham in July, has declared himself available for selection after announcing his retirement in September last year. George knows Marler well from England duty as well as the Lions tour to New Zealand and has nothing but praise for the 29-year-old. \u201cWhenever Marler\u2019s around, it\u2019s always extremely entertaining. He\u2019s been amazing,\u201d George says. \u201cIt seems a long time since he left \u2013 a lot has happened. He\u2019s a joker off the field but he\u2019s a calm head on it and has a huge amount of experience. He keeps things nice and calm, adding some key points around the new scrummaging laws. He\u2019s been vital around that. He just wanted to play with me again I think!\u201d",

It made perfect sense for us.\u201d</p> <p>The two traveled to Ju\u00e1rez, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/26/el-paso-texas-immigration-court-us-mexico-border\">migrants and asylum seekers</a> have been suffering in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy, which has resulted in tens of thousands of people being turned away. They were on the Mexico side of the border when they started getting messages asking if they were OK. That\u2019s when they learned that directly across the border, a popular Texas shopping center that draws patrons from Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso had become the latest site of bloodshed.</p> <p>\u201cI get this news on a regular basis, at least once a week. We are in this fight. This is what we do now,\u201d said Manuel. \u201cBut this was very close to us, in a state that is really promoting guns everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>This shooting shared similarities with many of the deadliest US massacres in recent years \u2013 a young white suspect killing many and injuring dozens in a short span of time in a packed public space. But this time authorities labeled it an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/04/mass-shooting-el-paso-texas-woman-killed-saved-baby\">act of domestic terrorism</a> and launched a hate crime investigation after reports that the gunman had written a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/04/mass-shootings-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio-8chan-far-right-website\">racist and xenophobic manifesto</a> that warned of a \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca62e14fedfd07aad7506a9c07e38f74f93827fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca62e14fedfd07aad7506a9c07e38f74f93827fd/0_138_4252_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beto O\u2019Rourke joins the family during an unveiling ceremony for Oliver\u2019s mural.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beto O\u2019Rourke joins the family during an unveiling ceremony for Oliver\u2019s mural.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cedar Attanasio/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The document directly echoed the president\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, and some have said the shooting marks the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/us/el-paso-shooting-mexico-border.html\">deadliest anti-Latino attack</a> in modern US history.</p> <p>That reality made it all the more upsetting to Manuel to read Trump\u2019s tweet on Monday morning saying the weekend\u2019s violence should inspire lawmakers to pass \u201cdesperately needed immigration reform\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall immigrants involved in mass shootings, as shooters.

As roads around her went on lockdown on Saturday in the wake of the shooting, she was reminded of the road closures that made it hard for her to get to her husband on 14 February 2018, when she first learned of the school shooting and left her office.\u201cIt\u2019s awful.\u201d She was not, however, surprised. \u201cI was really mad \u2013 very, very mad.\u201d As common as these tragedies have become, she said she did not want America to accept this as \u201cour new reality\u201d. \u201cWe have to take that out of our minds. This is not normal, at all. Never, ever.\u201d The couple have become vocal advocates for stricter gun laws, traveling across the country to fight for reforms. They are originally from Venezuela and are also passionate about fighting for the rights of immigrants \u2013 a subject that was of great importance to their son. \u201cJoaquin was very concerned about the treatment that the United States gave to immigrants,\u201d Manuel said. \u201cThat was one of his things to fight for, and we wanted to share that with everybody by honoring our son on his 19th birthday. It made perfect sense for us.\u201d The two traveled to Ju\u00e1rez, where migrants and asylum seekers have been suffering in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy, which has resulted in tens of thousands of people being turned away. They were on the Mexico side of the border when they started getting messages asking if they were OK. That\u2019s when they learned that directly across the border, a popular Texas shopping center that draws patrons from Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso had become the latest site of bloodshed. \u201cI get this news on a regular basis, at least once a week. We are in this fight. This is what we do now,\u201d said Manuel. \u201cBut this was very close to us, in a state that is really promoting guns everywhere.\u201d This shooting shared similarities with many of the deadliest US massacres in recent years \u2013 a young white suspect killing many and injuring dozens in a short span of time in a packed public space. But this time authorities labeled it an act of domestic terrorism and launched a hate crime investigation after reports that the gunman had written a racist and xenophobic manifesto that warned of a \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas\u201d. The document directly echoed the president\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, and some have said the shooting marks the deadliest anti-Latino attack in modern US history. That reality made it all the more upsetting to Manuel to read Trump\u2019s tweet on Monday morning saying the weekend\u2019s violence should inspire lawmakers to pass \u201cdesperately needed immigration reform\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t recall immigrants involved in mass shootings, as shooters. When they are involved, they are victims, just like Joaquin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a family of immigrants \u2026 This is hitting us in both ways. We were a target two days ago.\u201d He continued: \u201cThis president is really not concerned about saving lives. He\u2019s just bringing in the immigration issue as if that will solve problems.\u201d Patricia said she wanted to see the president \u201ctake responsibility\u201d, adding: \u201cHe created this hatred. He created this division. He has to fix it, and he has to watch his words.\u201d On Sunday, Joaquin\u2019s birthday, the couple went to Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, and Manuel completed his planned mural, which included an image of his son\u2019s face, next to the words: \u201cSeparating me from my mom was not a good idea \u2026 Now you have to deal with her. Good luck!\u201d On Monday morning, the sidewalk by the mural was adorned with flowers and candles, under the words Manuel added after the tragedy: \u201cEl Paso no est\u00e1 solo\u201d (meaning \u201cEl Paso is not alone\u201d). Manuel said it was vital to fight for better gun policy in the immediate aftermath of tragedy: \u201cThis is the right moment to ask for changes and make demands of our leaders \u2026 This is the time to talk about guns. This is when the media is covering the story. We know that from Parkland.\u201d The father said he was moved by an old tweet written by his son before his death, which seemed especially powerful this week. Joaquin addressed his message to Trump supporters, asking \u201cif they could live without me\u201d. \u201cIf I vanished today would you be happy? \u2026 Not even just me but anyone being discriminated by your president. Would you guys be 100% okay with your immigrant friends never existing in your life? \u2026 If you stay quiet, you\u2019re supporting him. So fight for us and we\u2019ll fight for you. Love us and we\u2019ll love you.\u201d Patricia said her son was her motivation to keep advocating, even in the hardest times. \u201cSince this happened to us, I swore to Joaquin that this won\u2019t be in vain,\u201d she said.",

By tying legislation for tougher gun laws to immigration reform, as he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1158330513951735809\">tweeted</a> earlier, Trump also and by extension blamed immigrants, who themselves are the victims of the very racism that has been unleashed by this president.</p> <p>With this ethical black hole of leadership and narcissistic exploitation of other people\u2019s tragedy, Trump proves once again \u2013 as if we needed any more proof \u2013&#xa0;that he is unfit for the office he occupies. But the tragedy is larger than his job. It\u2019s also what he\u2019s doing to our country.</p> <p>How are we, the ordinary people of this country, supposed to go about our daily lives in this country any more? The victims in Ohio were doing nothing but enjoying themselves before they were gunned down. The killed and wounded in El Paso were doing nothing but back-to-school shopping.</p> <p>Nor does it stop there. Last April, people were terrorized in Poway, California, when a shooter entered their synagogue as they were celebrating Passover and began firing. And at least since last March, when a suspected white supremacist stormed two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 51 people, American Muslims have congregated more nervously, increasing security at their mosques around the country. If you think the New Zealand connection is far afield from the American context, note that both the alleged Poway and El Paso shooters referenced the New Zealand shooter directly and favorably in their own manifestos.</p> <p>\u201cIn general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto,\u201d the alleged El Paso shooter\u2019s manifesto says. \u201cThis attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas. They are the instigators, not me.\u201d The rhetoric here sounds suspiciously like the president\u2019s, who for months, had been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1056919064906469376\">tweeting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/29/trump-baltimore-infest-tweet-cummings-racist-227485\">shrieking</a> about the so-called caravan being \u201can invasion of our country\u201d.

The couple were asked to leave on Saturday when the evacuation zone was extended, but decided to hunker down, despite the threat of a huge wave rushing out of the damaged Toddbrook reservoir. They are not alone in staying put: 20 residents, including a small number who were initially evacuated but have since returned to their homes, remain in 16 properties in the evacuation zone despite warnings of catastrophic consequences if the reservoir dam fails. Deputy chief constable Rachel Swann said: \u201cWe will repeatedly visit these people to remind them of the risks they are posing to themselves and emergency responders, however there is no specific legislation under which we can force these people to leave.\u201d The number of remaining residents had been 31 before Derbyshire\u2019s police and crime commissioner, Hardyal Dhindsa, told a public meeting on Monday: \u201cThere is a minority number of people not wanting to leave their properties and they are taking their lives into their own hands.\u201d Dhindsa acknowledged that locals were facing severe disruption as the round-the-clock operation continued, but stressed that the top priority remained the threat to life. In the middle of Sunday night, four police officers walked down the cobbled path leading to Venton and Ellis\u2019s home shining torches into the row of cottages.

      "body": "<p>Well, that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. On a mild, sunlit Birmingham day Australia bowled straight, fielded well, swarmed around England\u2019s batsmen and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/05/england-collapse-hands-australia-a-crushing-first-test-victory-ashes\" title=\"\">took wickets with disarming ease</a> in front of stands filled with garrulous southern hemisphere voices.</p> \n<p>As the final clatter began in earnest after lunch the endgame to this first Ashes Test began to feel a little giddy and light-hearted. There were ironic cheers for Moeen Ali as he successfully defended a straight ball from Nathan Lyon. England batsmen were barracked from the centre by the touring support en route to a 251-run defeat. Tim Paine\u2019s team weren\u2019t just in control here. They were enjoying themselves.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/05/england-collapse-hands-australia-a-crushing-first-test-victory-ashes\">Australia seal crushing win in first Ashes Test as England collapse</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is, of course, nothing to be gained from talking up your own home ground as a fortress or a cauldron. Just as in reality a group of drunken men in ostrich costumes are never likely to have any tangible bearing on the fine-point skills, the high-stress internal mechanics of Test cricket. But England will now retreat from one of their most impregnable home venues required to go against the dominant history of modern-day Ashes cricket.</p> \n<p>In the past 50 years there have been 27 Ashes series. In this time England have only twice lost the first Test and gone on to win the series. Those two occasions were the miracle series of 1981 and the miracle series of 2005. Perhaps we\u2019re heading for another miracle series now. Thirty years on they might still be talking about Rory\u2019s Ashes or the Annus Mo-Rabilis. More ominous for England is the fact that in 17 of those 27 series Australia have won or drawn the first Test and gone on to take the series.</p> \n<p>There will, of course, be hand\u2011wringing now, as there must be hand-wringing. But it is also hard to know what England might have done differently. In the past they have lost Ashes Test matches because the players have performed poorly or their selection has been obviously muddled. This is not really the case here.</p> \n<p>England had one appalling stroke of bad luck, losing their best bowler in the first hour of play. But even with Jimmy Anderson in the XI some things are now clear. Australia have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/04/steve-smith-australia-england-ashes-second-hundred\" title=\"\">the best batsman in either team</a> \u2013 and indeed the best batsman of the modern era. Australia have the best spinner. Australia have the best pace attack unless conditions even things up.</p> \n<p>Whereas right now it is easier to pick out the areas of weakness in England\u2019s Test team than its strengths. By the end of this match England reached a point of critical mass, with six players either injured, unproven or in the doldrums (Anderson, Jason Roy, Joe Denly, Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow and Moeen) and just five in form and unarguably in the right spot.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>England batted quite well in the first innings. Joe Root\u2019s presence settled the top order, Stuart Broad bowled well until he was worn down. Chris Woakes was weirdly under-bowled. But that lurking brittleness was there even during those periods when they had the upper hand. Ben Stokes bowled poorly at times on the first day just when England needed to turn the screw. Moeen just needs some time to collect his game. It was at times painful to watch him here.</p> \n<p>As for Denly, well, perhaps in nine years when he has 25 Test hundreds people will say, can you believe it, they picked him at first as a part time leg-spinner: look at him now, the 42\u2011year\u2011old new Bradman. But this will require some fast work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"45f97923-ab31-4d4d-8850-d1f4b7a1d393\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o_muY_XZjJw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jos Buttler, England\u2019s Test No 5, has one hundred to his name in first\u2011class cricket in the past five years. Here he was bowled trying to defend a ball from Pat Cummins that hit the top of off stump. Nathan Lyon bowled superbly, finding just the right line and the right pace to make the fifth\u2011day pitch work for him.</p> \n<p>Otherwise there were few surprises in this performance. Members of the team who were looking short of confidence or class at this level continued to do so. And this is pretty much it for England and red\u2011ball cricket. The options are circumscribed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/05/joe-root-england-kneejerk-australia-first-test-defeat\">Joe Root says England will not make kneejerk decisions after Test rout</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Jofra Archer will come in, all being well. He is a hugely talented cricketer. But he will be expected to help change the trajectory of an Ashes series having not played a red\u2011ball game since last September. Otherwise the prominence of white\u2011ball cricket means there is no cab off the rank, no one in form, no one hammering on the door. The last round of County Championship matches ended on 16 July.</p> \n<p>Plus, of course, this is a structural thing. Don\u2019t call it a hangover. England\u2019s losing start here is not to do with the aftershocks of the World Cup. It\u2019s to do with the pre\u2011shocks, the pre-effects. For four years this team, the red ball one, has been secondary in planning and resources. Men who were being asked here to bat the day out have been encouraged to whack a white ball into the stands rather than work on gritty defence on English pitches. England\u2019s team here is pegged around explosive white-ball talents: because these are the talents they have.</p> \n<p>Not that anyone has anything to answer for here. It is extremely hard in any sport to be good at all the formats, all the competitions. And this was the result for England: a Test team with some loose parts that were expertly exposed here.</p> \n<p>If there is encouragement to be taken it is that an undercooked, underdone England have four Tests to finesse the gameplan. A change of conditions at Lord\u2019s is more likely to help them than a change of players. But they will have to work fast.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Well, that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. On a mild, sunlit Birmingham day Australia bowled straight, fielded well, swarmed around England\u2019s batsmen and took wickets with disarming ease in front of stands filled with garrulous southern hemisphere voices. As the final clatter began in earnest after lunch the endgame to this first Ashes Test began to feel a little giddy and light-hearted. There were ironic cheers for Moeen Ali as he successfully defended a straight ball from Nathan Lyon. England batsmen were barracked from the centre by the touring support en route to a 251-run defeat. Tim Paine\u2019s team weren\u2019t just in control here. They were enjoying themselves. There is, of course, nothing to be gained from talking up your own home ground as a fortress or a cauldron. Just as in reality a group of drunken men in ostrich costumes are never likely to have any tangible bearing on the fine-point skills, the high-stress internal mechanics of Test cricket. But England will now retreat from one of their most impregnable home venues required to go against the dominant history of modern-day Ashes cricket. In the past 50 years there have been 27 Ashes series. In this time England have only twice lost the first Test and gone on to win the series. Those two occasions were the miracle series of 1981 and the miracle series of 2005. Perhaps we\u2019re heading for another miracle series now. Thirty years on they might still be talking about Rory\u2019s Ashes or the Annus Mo-Rabilis. More ominous for England is the fact that in 17 of those 27 series Australia have won or drawn the first Test and gone on to take the series. There will, of course, be hand\u2011wringing now, as there must be hand-wringing. But it is also hard to know what England might have done differently. In the past they have lost Ashes Test matches because the players have performed poorly or their selection has been obviously muddled. This is not really the case here. England had one appalling stroke of bad luck, losing their best bowler in the first hour of play. But even with Jimmy Anderson in the XI some things are now clear. Australia have the best batsman in either team \u2013 and indeed the best batsman of the modern era. Australia have the best spinner. Australia have the best pace attack unless conditions even things up. Whereas right now it is easier to pick out the areas of weakness in England\u2019s Test team than its strengths. By the end of this match England reached a point of critical mass, with six players either injured, unproven or in the doldrums (Anderson, Jason Roy, Joe Denly, Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow and Moeen) and just five in form and unarguably in the right spot. England batted quite well in the first innings. Joe Root\u2019s presence settled the top order, Stuart Broad bowled well until he was worn down. Chris Woakes was weirdly under-bowled. But that lurking brittleness was there even during those periods when they had the upper hand. Ben Stokes bowled poorly at times on the first day just when England needed to turn the screw. Moeen just needs some time to collect his game. It was at times painful to watch him here. As for Denly, well, perhaps in nine years when he has 25 Test hundreds people will say, can you believe it, they picked him at first as a part time leg-spinner: look at him now, the 42\u2011year\u2011old new Bradman. But this will require some fast work. Jos Buttler, England\u2019s Test No 5, has one hundred to his name in first\u2011class cricket in the past five years. Here he was bowled trying to defend a ball from Pat Cummins that hit the top of off stump. Nathan Lyon bowled superbly, finding just the right line and the right pace to make the fifth\u2011day pitch work for him. Otherwise there were few surprises in this performance. Members of the team who were looking short of confidence or class at this level continued to do so. And this is pretty much it for England and red\u2011ball cricket. The options are circumscribed. Jofra Archer will come in, all being well. He is a hugely talented cricketer. But he will be expected to help change the trajectory of an Ashes series having not played a red\u2011ball game since last September. Otherwise the prominence of white\u2011ball cricket means there is no cab off the rank, no one in form, no one hammering on the door. The last round of County Championship matches ended on 16 July. Plus, of course, this is a structural thing. Don\u2019t call it a hangover. England\u2019s losing start here is not to do with the aftershocks of the World Cup. It\u2019s to do with the pre\u2011shocks, the pre-effects. For four years this team, the red ball one, has been secondary in planning and resources. Men who were being asked here to bat the day out have been encouraged to whack a white ball into the stands rather than work on gritty defence on English pitches. England\u2019s team here is pegged around explosive white-ball talents: because these are the talents they have. Not that anyone has anything to answer for here. It is extremely hard in any sport to be good at all the formats, all the competitions. And this was the result for England: a Test team with some loose parts that were expertly exposed here. If there is encouragement to be taken it is that an undercooked, underdone England have four Tests to finesse the gameplan. A change of conditions at Lord\u2019s is more likely to help them than a change of players. But they will have to work fast.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has bought fashion firm Jack Wills out of administration, as retail mogul Mike Ashley presses on with an acquisition spree that has appeared to be backfiring badly in recent weeks. The deal means a stay of execution for 1,700 staff working in Jack Wills\u2019 100 UK stores and its six franchises, including several in the Middle East. Sports Direct\u2019s billionaire boss has orchestrated an array of acquisitions and attempted purchases of struggling businesses in recent years, with mixed results. The biggest was House of Fraser, which Sports Direct bought out of administration last August for \u00a390m and recently described as \u201cterminal\u201d in its financial results. The profit update was repeatedly delayed in shambolic scenes that saw the company reveal a surprise \u20ac674m (\u00a3605m) tax bill. Ashley also owns a 19% stake in five-a-side football pitch operator Goals Soccer Centres, which is embroiled in an accounting scandal. He has also bought struggling Game Digital, owns Evans Cycles and Sofa.com, and tried unsuccessfully to buy Debenhams and Findel, the online retail and education group. Jack Wills will become part of a new division within Sports Direct, which said it wants to expand into \u201cbuying and building\u201d fashion and sports brands despite its own financial travails. Michael Murray, who is leading the division and assumes the title head of elevation as a result, said: \u201cJack Wills has made a name for itself carving out a unique place in the minds of consumers since its launch and has today grown into one of the most recognised British fashion brands. Sports Direct\u2019s first act will be to negotiate with the chain\u2019s landlords in a bid to reduce rents, echoing moves made by dozens of retailers \u2013 including several in Ashley\u2019s stable \u2013 to slash their costs. Accounting firm KPMG, which was managing the administration, said the business had \u201cexperienced mounting cash flow pressures amid some of the most difficult trading conditions seen on the high street in years\u201d. Suzanne Harlow, chief executive of Jack Wills, said: \u201cFor the past year, we have been focused on improving the Jack Wills proposition and the group\u2019s financial performance. Despite significant progress, the challenging trading environment led us to conclude that the company\u2019s long-term future would be best served as part of a larger group and Sports Direct will enable us to do this.\u201d",

With little prospect of the European mission coming together, stretched British forces will soon start working with the US, which has a command and control operation in Bahrain, to accompany tankers passing through the strait of Hormuz.

They stormed \u201cFortress Edgbaston\u201d thanks to centuries in both innings from Steve Smith in a remarkable comeback from his 12-month ball-tampering suspension.</p> \n<p>Root, whose problems include troubling performances from three senior players in Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali, said: \u201cWe need to make sure we don\u2019t make any shotgun decisions. This is not your typical England team. It\u2019s up and down, which can be frustrating, but we\u2019re more than capable of going against the trend. I\u2019m fully expecting us to fight our way back into this series.\u201d</p> \n<p>Losing Anderson after four overs of the Test left Root playing with 10 men, the 37-year-old having gone into the match after a month out with a calf strain. He is now awaiting the results of a second scan on its apparent recurrence. Asked if he had any regrets, Root replied: \u201cNot at all. He passed every medical test. It was a unanimous decision for him to play.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tim Paine, in contrast,said Australia\u2019s confidence grew as a result of the injury, much like England\u2019s did during the 2005 Edgbaston Test when Glenn McGrath stepped on a ball before the start of play.</p> \n<p>The Australia captain said: \u201cJimmy Anderson is one of the best bowlers, if not the best bowler in the world, especially over here in England. I would be lying if I said psychologically it did not make a difference to our team, and physically to theirs. It is a big win for us, but they lost their premier bowler so we have to be realistic.

      "bodyText": "Joe Root says England must avoid making \u201cshotgun\u201d decisions after their crushing defeat by Australia in the first Test and the captain is unrepentant over the Jimmy Anderson selection gamble that blew up in his face on the opening morning. Needing to bat out three sessions on the final day to avoid taking a 1-0 deficit to Lord\u2019s next week, England were bowled out for 146 in only 52.3 overs as the off-spinner Nathan Lyon ran riot with six wickets on the turning pitch . The 251-run win by Australia was a remarkable turnaround from their 122 for eight on the opening day. They stormed \u201cFortress Edgbaston\u201d thanks to centuries in both innings from Steve Smith in a remarkable comeback from his 12-month ball-tampering suspension. Root, whose problems include troubling performances from three senior players in Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali, said: \u201cWe need to make sure we don\u2019t make any shotgun decisions. This is not your typical England team. It\u2019s up and down, which can be frustrating, but we\u2019re more than capable of going against the trend. I\u2019m fully expecting us to fight our way back into this series.\u201d Losing Anderson after four overs of the Test left Root playing with 10 men, the 37-year-old having gone into the match after a month out with a calf strain. He is now awaiting the results of a second scan on its apparent recurrence. Asked if he had any regrets, Root replied: \u201cNot at all. He passed every medical test. It was a unanimous decision for him to play.\u201d Tim Paine, in contrast,said Australia\u2019s confidence grew as a result of the injury, much like England\u2019s did during the 2005 Edgbaston Test when Glenn McGrath stepped on a ball before the start of play. The Australia captain said: \u201cJimmy Anderson is one of the best bowlers, if not the best bowler in the world, especially over here in England. I would be lying if I said psychologically it did not make a difference to our team, and physically to theirs. It is a big win for us, but they lost their premier bowler so we have to be realistic. That is why it is one win and there are four huge games to go.\u201d Jofra Archer is being lined up as Anderson\u2019s replacement and a Test debut at Lord\u2019s provided he can prove his fitness playing for Sussex 2nd XI on Tuesday, while Jack Leach will surely come into contention for the spinner\u2019s role after Moeen struggled to offer his captain any control with the ball. Root appeared to endorse Moeen holding on to his spot. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember how threatening he can be. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll dust himself down and make sure he\u2019s in a good head space going into Lord\u2019s,\u201d he said, only to backtrack when pressed further. There was also an acceptance that Jason Roy\u2019s aggressive game is suited only to certain scenarios after the opener was bowled by Lyon attempting to launch a six down the ground. Root said: \u201cIf he\u2019d had his chance again he might have gone about it slightly differently. But he\u2019s been picked to play in his own way.\u201d For Paine the win marked the successful reintegration of Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, even if the last two had a quiet Test. Their runs were scarcely needed, however, with Smith\u2019s match aggregate of 286 and near-chanceless performance an ominous portent for England\u2019s attack. Asked if such a performance would reopen wounds from the Smith-inspired 4-0 defeat of England in 2017-18, Paine replied: \u201cI\u2019m not sure \u2013 you\u2019d have to ask England that. But while Steve\u2019s scoring runs and Nathan\u2019s taking wickets we\u2019re a pretty dangerous team. And as I think you saw the rest of us will grow with confidence the better those guys are going.\u201d Australia now play a three-day tour match against Worcerstershire that starts on Wednesday. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, who missed out on selection at Edgbaston, are expected to play.",

      "bodyText": "The Coalition is being warned that a renewed push to tighten the character test for visa holders could see a fivefold increase in the number of people facing deportation, with residents from New Zealand and humanitarian refugees disproportionately affected. The Morrison government has reintroduced a bill to change the Migration Act to provide grounds for visa cancellation or refusal where a non-citizen has been convicted of a serious crime punishable by two years imprisonment, even if a jail term is not imposed. A submission from migration experts to the Senate committee examining the change warns the retrospective law could be the \u201clargest expansion of the character test provisions in the Migration Act in history\u201d and may result in the number of people who fail the character test automatically expanded \u201cby a factor of five\u201d. \u201cWhile difficult to compare, this may be one of the most significant retrospective applications of new legislation in recent parliamentary history, particularly for a bill with negative consequences for people,\u201d the joint submission says. \u201cGiven the retrospective application \u2026 there will likely be a step-change in the number and rate of visa cancellations and deportations from Australia.\u201d The signatories to the submission include immigration researcher and former Labor adviser Henry Sherrell, the former deputy secretary of the department of immigration Abul Rizvi, and academics Shanthi Robertson and Laurie Berg. The fivefold increase has been calculated using figures from the Judicial Commission of NSW on the assumption that visa holders have a similar criminal profile to that of the general population. Since changes to the character test were made by the Abbott government in December 2014, when Scott Morrison was immigration minister, the Coalition has cancelled a total of 4,150 visas, most of these being New Zealand citizens. Between 2016 and 2018 Australia forcibly deported 1,023 people to New Zealand, sparking warnings from across the Tasman that the policy has had a \u201ccorrosive\u201d effect on the bilateral relationship. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning NZ prime minister Jacinda Adern has repeatedly expressed concern to the Australian government that NZ citizens who were long-term Australian residents \u2013 including those who had never stepped foot in her country \u2013 were captured by the visa crackdown. She again raised the issue in talks with Scott Morrison last month, saying the deportation of criminals with almost no connection to New Zealand was not \u201cfair dinkum\u201d. \u201cWe have seen cases where there is also almost no connection of an individual to New Zealand who have been deported,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cI consider that to be a corrosive part of that policy. And it\u2019s having a corrosive effect on our relationship.\u201d A previous attempt to change the character test was shelved by the Coalition in the previous parliament after the legislation sat on the notice paper for 169 days and was not brought to a vote in the House of Representatives. Labor has indicated it will oppose the changes, but is waiting for the final report from the Senate standing committee on legal and constitutional affairs, which reports back to parliament on the changes on 13 September. \u201cAlong with the government, we await the report in September at the conclusion of the committee\u2019s considerations,\u201d Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, said. Immigration minister David Coleman has said the tougher character test was an \u201cimportant\u201d measure that would send \u201ca clear and unequivocal message\u201d that an Australian visa was a privilege granted only to those of good character. \u201cLike the Australian community, the government has no tolerance for non-citizens who are found to have committed these serious crimes,\u201d he said, when the bill was introduced last month. \u201cWe make absolutely no apologies for protecting the Australian community from these harmful people, and we will act decisively whenever we are made aware of that.\u201d",

But also that changes to the law must then be met with a commitment by hospitals and the public health system to ensure they provide access; that abortion is considered a public health issue. \u201cIt\u2019s had quite a radical effect, and a much bigger effect than I certainly expected,\u201d McNamee said. \u201cI had thought in my own head that [the repealed 1899 law criminalising abortion] was just an excuse for the state of things. But the biggest thing that has happened, only because we have a health minister [Steven Miles] who is modern and pro-choice, once the legislation came into effect there was a directive to all Queensland health services hospital districts to create a pathway. \u201cObviously the best scenario is that every public hospital in Queensland would have a termination facility, medical and surgical. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit piecemeal. I get calls from GPs that [it has] not been the reality across Queensland, some \u2026 public hospitals are on the opposite end of the scale and basically offering nothing. They are required by the minister to offer a pathway, and that can involve funding private services.\u201d \u201cBut overall the knock-on effect to services has been surprising in the best possible way.\u201d McNamee says it\u2019s ironic that Ireland beat Queensland to decriminalisation of abortion, and that Queensland led the way for NSW. \u201cThey\u2019d think of us as redneck, backward type of people,\u201d she jokes. \u201cBut we have shown them the way here. \u201cOverall the change in the law was much more dramatic than I expected. The day it was passed was much more significant than I expected. When it did pass that was a pretty great day for Queensland. The knock-on effect to services has been surprising in the best possible way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Energy retailers are pushing back against a proposal to allow large commercial users to enter the wholesale electricity market for the first time, prompting warnings that the sector wants to stifle competition. The Australian Energy Market Commission will hear from energy companies Engie and Simec Energy on Tuesday about its proposed demand response mechanism, which has been hailed as a win for consumers that will see electricity prices fall. In a letter to AEMC, Simec is warning that the new rule could impose an economic levy on host retailers and create \u201cperverse incentives\u201d that could see regulatory costs increase. It is asking the regulator to consider not going ahead with the change. Engie\u2019s reasons for its request to the AEMC for a special hearing have not been published. But the hearing comes as the Australia Institute, which was one of the proponents for the rule change, releases new research showing that other major electricity markets are forging ahead with similar demand response schemes to benefit consumers with lower prices and better reliability. The Australia Institute\u2019s head of energy policy, Dan Cass, said that the three biggest electricity markets in the world \u2013 China, the USA and the European Union \u2013 were all moving to open up their networks to demand response competition. \u201cThe rest of the world is charging ahead with energy market modernisation and Australia is now poised to make a major reform that will put us at the leading edge,\u201d Cass told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe big energy retailers want to prevent competition. They want to be the gate-keepers and decide whether or not their customers participate in emerging, digital energy markets.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Under the proposed rule change, the Australian Energy Market Operator would be able to bypass retailers and pay large energy users to cut their power use via a third-party service provider. The measure, which will put the so-called \u201cdemand response\u201d on an equal footing to generation for the first time, will see energy users paid as if they are generators. A demand response mechanism was recommended by both Alan Finkel\u2019s review into the energy market and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s retail electricity pricing inquiry. The Australian Energy Council, which represents retailers, advocated an alternative demand response model that would see retailers negotiate with demand aggregators on behalf of customers, but this was opposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The Australian Institute report says the suggestion that incumbent energy companies should be allowed to control the sale of services that undermine their interests would be \u201cunimaginable\u201d in most industries. \u201cIt would be like the taxi industry maintaining the best way to increase competition is to ensure all orders for passenger transport, including ride-sharing companies like Uber, must go to the taxi company first,\u201d the report says. Cass said the demand response rule, which is due to come into effect in 2022, needed to be in place to help maintain reliability and security of supply when AGL\u2019s Liddell power station closes in 2023. \u201cProgressing this reform and allowing everyone, including big industrial users and regular households, to engage in demand response as soon as possible will reduce energy costs and emissions while also improving reliability.\u201d The energy minister, Angus Taylor, last month welcomed the draft rule change, saying it would increase competition, \u201cleading to lower prices for everyone\u201d. \u201cThis proposed rule change builds on action already taken by the government to empower consumers to get a better deal, and increase the availability of dispatchable resources in the wholesale market to keep the lights on and bring prices down,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has no intention of renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and a no-deal Brexit is his \u201ccentral scenario\u201d, European diplomats have been told, amid hardening evidence in Westminster that the government is expecting to crash out of the EU. Brussels diplomats briefed after a meeting between the prime minister\u2019s chief envoy and senior EU figures in Brussels said that Britain\u2019s refusal to compromise was understood to have been clear to those attending. Instead David Frost, the government\u2019s new chief Europe adviser, is said to have sought discussions on how negotiations could be reset after the UK crashes out on 31 October. \u201cIt was clear UK does not have another plan,\u201d a senior EU diplomat said of the meetings with Frost. \u201cNo intention to negotiate, which would require a plan. A no deal now appears to be the UK government\u2019s central scenario.\u201d The disclosure came as No 10 insisted the government was \u201cready to negotiate in good faith\u201d but made clear that Johnson would only agree to a deal without what he refers to as the \u201cundemocratic backstop\u201d \u2013 the mechanism to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland that could keep the UK in a customs union. The EU has repeatedly said the backstop is not up for negotiation. The UK\u2019s failure to provide any proposals on how to deal with the controversial Irish backstop was felt to be significant by EU officials who spoke to the Guardian. Frost was said to have told the officials that a technological solution to the Irish border was the UK\u2019s preferred option before admitting that \u201cit would not be ready now for Brexit\u201d. \u201cEven if EU gave up the backstop there is no alternative,\u201d a diplomat concluded of the discussion. \u201cThat message has now gone loud and clear to capitals, it was useful to hear it from horse\u2019s mouth,\u201d the EU source said. \u201cReality is sinking in.\u201d With no new UK-EU talks scheduled, there were meanwhile signs in Westminster that Johnson\u2019s government was readying itself for a no-deal Brexit and preparing to do battle with Tory MPs who have said they will join with opposition parties to prevent that outcome. The prime minister\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, instructed special advisers across the government to keep on top of preparations for a no deal Brexit early on Monday morning and attacked Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, for failing to get the country ready. Over the weekend, it became clear he believes that Johnson could simply refuse to resign in the event of losing a no-confidence motion and schedule an general election for November \u2013 after leaving the EU at the end of October. Johnson said on Monday that an election was the \u201clast thing\u201d he wanted. But his official spokesman stressed at his regular briefing for journalists that Brexit would take place on 31 October \u201cwhatever the circumstances\u201d, even if parliament has voted against a no-deal departure or passed a confidence motion against the prime minister necessitating an election. Conservative rebels plotting against a no-deal Brexit are already considering how to thwart No 10, believing an alternative government could potentially be created with a majority to challenge Johnson if he loses a confidence vote. Corbyn indicated on Monday that he may be prepared to bring a no-confidence vote in the government very soon after parliament returns from its summer break in September. \u201cWe will do everything to stop no deal, including a no-confidence vote at the appropriate very early time to do it,\u201d he said on a visit to flood-stricken Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire. \u201cThe prime minister seems to be trying to slip no deal through, slip past parliament and slip past the British people. \u201cSorry, no deal will be really serious. Serious for food prices, for medical supplies, for trade, for investment, and drive us straight into the hands of the sort of trade deal that Donald Trump wants to do with Boris Johnson. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not on, it\u2019s not acceptable. We will do everything we can to block it.\u201d Several Conservative MPs, including Hammond, have indicated they could vote with Labour to bring Johnson down if he is set on a no-deal Brexit. Friends of Hammond also hit back at Cummings on Monday, saying it was \u201csimply untrue\u201d that the Treasury had failed to prepare. \u201cThe bigger question is why is Dominic Cummings, the de facto deputy PM, so keen to spend yet more taxpayers\u2019 money on something that his boss insists has only a one in a million chance of happening?\u201d one Hammond ally said. EU officials increasingly believe the UK is heading for a no-deal exit after their meetings with Frost, who replaced Theresa May\u2019s chief negotiator, Olly Robbins. Last week, Frost met Clara Mart\u00ednez Alberola, the head of cabinet for the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker; St\u00e9phanie Riso, a senior official in Michel Barnier\u2019s negotiations taskforce, who was a key player in drafting the terms of the backstop, and Ilze Juhansone, the deputy secretary general at the commission. The demand over the weekend by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, that Barnier seek a new negotiating mandate from the EU\u2019s leaders to allow fresh talks was seen as mere \u201cnoise\u201d. Diplomats said the message was seen as \u201cconfrontational \u2013 unhelpful\u201d but that more in that vein was expected at a meeting of the G7 in Biarritz, when Johnson will meet Juncker. A spokeswoman for the European commission said the impact of the UK crashing out would be proportionally heavier on the British side of the Channel. The spokeswoman added: \u201cFor a negotiation to be successful it takes two to tango. If the music and the rhythm is not right then \u2026 you have no dance. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that it was a failure.

      "bodyText": "Joel Wilson may welcome his switch to the TV umpire\u2019s booth for the second Test at Lord\u2019s next week after the Trinidadian official equalled the record for the most overturned decisions in a match. When Joe Root successfully reviewed after being given out lbw to Peter Siddle for 18 on the final morning at Edgbaston \u2013 the ball struck the inside edge before its impact with the pad \u2013 it was the eighth time across five days that one of Wilson\u2019s calls had been overturned. That figure equals the record shared by two umpires since the decision review system was introduced 11 years ago. Kumar Dharmasena\u2019s tough Test came in 2016 when England beat Bangladesh on a spinning pitch in Chittagong, with half of his 16 out/not out decisions changed on review (including three in six balls). The Indian official Sundaram Ravi endured a similarly challenging Test between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in 2017 with eight calls changed following the use of technology. Wilson, who was promoted to the International Cricket Council\u2019s elite panel of umpires last month after 13 Tests and 63 one-day internationals, is one of just five on the 12-strong list who can stand in an England-Australia match given the need for neutrality by way of nationality. But with the more experienced Aleem Dar also having two decisions overturned at Edgbaston \u2013 the Australia batsmen David Warner and James Pattinson also failed to review two incorrect lbws by Dar on day one \u2013 there have been calls for an end to this requirement in order to share the workload and reduce fatigue.

      "bodyText": "A strike by more than 4,000 Heathrow staff that was expected to cause widespread disruption for air passengers on Tuesday has been called off, after the airport made a new offer to security guards, firefighters, engineers and passenger service workers. Trade unions have been locked in talks with the airport over pay and had warned that up to 88,000 passengers could be affected by a 48-hour stoppage on Monday and Tuesday. Approximately 177 flights across all airlines were due to be cancelled over the two days, until Unite agreed late on Sunday night to suspend Monday\u2019s walkout while talks continued. Despite the suspension, 16 flights were cancelled on Monday \u2013 and a further five moved to other airports \u2013 with Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines, Air France and Qatar Airways all affected. But in a statement issued on Monday, Heathrow said it had made a new offer to the Unite trade union, leading to the postponement of Tuesday\u2019s 24-hour strike, which was due to start at midnight. Walkouts planned for the 23 and 24 August are still scheduled to go ahead. \u201cUnite will now take an improved offer to its members and we remain hopeful that we can find a resolution and stop this disruptive and unnecessary threat of strike action,\u201d said an airport spokesperson. \u201cWe regret that passengers have been inconvenienced by this and urge them to contact their airline for up to date information on the status of their service.\u201d Unite said it would not be revealing the details of the improved offer until its members involved in the dispute have had the chance to consider and vote on the new package. Heathrow is understood to be talking to airlines in an effort to reinstate some of the flights that were due to be cancelled on Tuesday. The airport has insisted that its offer to more than 4,000 staff is fair and above the retail price index measure of inflation. It also denied suggestions from Unite that strikes could cost the company more than \u00a34m in compensation payouts to affected airlines. Earlier on Monday, Heathrow said its offer ensured that all \u201cfrontline colleagues\u201d would receive a 7.3% pay increase over two-and-a-half years, higher than that recently offered to public sector staff.

      "bodyText": "Events have moved disturbingly swiftly since Donald Trump surprised everyone last week by announcing plans for a fresh wave of tariffs on Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated by targeting US agricultural products and allowing its currency to depreciate against the US dollar. Mr Trump duly fired off a tweet accusing the Chinese of currency manipulation, a clear sign that he is preparing to ratchet up the tension still further. Financial markets have responded predictably to this major escalation in the economic cold war. Share prices fell and investors sought out the traditional safe haven assets: gold and the swiss franc.

The ACLU of Oregon and law firm Tonkon Torp filed the suit in Multnomah county court on behalf of Michelle Fawcett, 53.

      "body": "<p>Many of the names will still resonate for older readers. All too few of them can have any associations for younger ones. They were the shipbuilding firms of Britain, the companies that, until the first world war and beyond, made the majority of the world\u2019s ships. They were still big manufacturing concerns in the post-1945 era. They were firms like John Brown\u2019s, Fairfield\u2019s and Scott Lithgow on the Clyde, Swan Hunter on the Tyne, Short Brothers on Wearside and Smiths Dock on the Tees. One or two of these once fabled companies still survive, like Vickers in Barrow and Cammell Laird on the Mersey. Today, though, Britain is not a shipbuilding leviathan but a minnow. According to <a href=\"https://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/TableViewer/tableView.aspx\" title=\"\">UN statistics</a>, the UK now builds so few ships that our share of world shipbuilding is measured at 0.0%. In the 21st century it is China, South Korea and Japan who build the merchant ships that still carry some 90% of the world\u2019s trade.</p> <p>Another of the UK\u2019s shipbuilding legends called in the receivers this week. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/05/harland-and-wolff-shipyard-expected-to-go-into-administration-belfast\" title=\"\">Harland and Wolff</a> in Belfast once built ships like the Titanic, the Pendennis Castle, the Canberra and, for the navy, HMS Belfast. Its big yellow Samson and Goliath gantries still dominate the River Lagan\u2019s eastern bank, towering over the tourists who flock to the <a href=\"https://titanicbelfast.com/Explore.aspx\" title=\"\">Titanic Belfast</a> visitor centre nearby. During the second world war, H&amp;W employed around 35,000 people. Today, H&amp;W is Norwegian-owned and the number of employees has dwindled to a few hundred, mainly refurbishing oil rigs and making offshore wind turbines. Now even they have been given their cards after administrators were called in. The unions are picketing the yard, and are pressing for the company to be nationalised.</p> <p>Harland and Wolff is resonant not just because it is such a storied shipyard. It is also an icon of Northern Ireland loyalism. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/12/northernireland.henrymcdonald\" title=\"\">Its historic reputation</a> was rooted in the mass expulsion of Catholic workers from the yard during the fight that led to partition a century ago. In the 1970s, a combination of militancy and intimidation shut the yard and helped bring the Heath government\u2019s efforts at power-sharing to an end. Today, even though much has changed, the closure may trigger some schadenfreude in republican Belfast. But in such a DUP stronghold as east Belfast it may also provoke anger that the party has not delivered enough UK support to protect H&amp;W and its future. <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/ulster/2019/0805/1067056-harland-and-wolff/\" title=\"\">The unions\u2019 threat</a> to run H&amp;W candidates against the DUP is certainly one to watch.</p> <p>This latest shipyard closure underscores <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/06/uk-shipbuilding-industry-bae-portsmouth\" title=\"\">a wider British failure</a> from the 1980s on. End of empire need not have meant an end of British shipbuilding. But it was allowed to happen. Tough, government-led decisions to target <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/shipbuilding-in-britain-how-to-reboot-it-87031\" title=\"\">new commercial shipping markets</a> for fishing vessels, ferries and cruise ships were never taken. Governments focused instead on naval needs alone; R&amp;D defaulted to the defence agenda. The result is that a post-Brexit Britain would have no shipbuilding sector adapted to 21st-century markets. Instead, it would be closed for business.</p>",

In the 21st century it is China, South Korea and Japan who build the merchant ships that still carry some 90% of the world\u2019s trade. Another of the UK\u2019s shipbuilding legends called in the receivers this week. Harland and Wolff in Belfast once built ships like the Titanic, the Pendennis Castle, the Canberra and, for the navy, HMS Belfast. Its big yellow Samson and Goliath gantries still dominate the River Lagan\u2019s eastern bank, towering over the tourists who flock to the Titanic Belfast visitor centre nearby. During the second world war, H&amp;W employed around 35,000 people. Today, H&amp;W is Norwegian-owned and the number of employees has dwindled to a few hundred, mainly refurbishing oil rigs and making offshore wind turbines. Now even they have been given their cards after administrators were called in. The unions are picketing the yard, and are pressing for the company to be nationalised. Harland and Wolff is resonant not just because it is such a storied shipyard. It is also an icon of Northern Ireland loyalism. Its historic reputation was rooted in the mass expulsion of Catholic workers from the yard during the fight that led to partition a century ago. In the 1970s, a combination of militancy and intimidation shut the yard and helped bring the Heath government\u2019s efforts at power-sharing to an end. Today, even though much has changed, the closure may trigger some schadenfreude in republican Belfast. But in such a DUP stronghold as east Belfast it may also provoke anger that the party has not delivered enough UK support to protect H&amp;W and its future. The unions\u2019 threat to run H&amp;W candidates against the DUP is certainly one to watch. This latest shipyard closure underscores a wider British failure from the 1980s on. End of empire need not have meant an end of British shipbuilding. But it was allowed to happen. Tough, government-led decisions to target new commercial shipping markets for fishing vessels, ferries and cruise ships were never taken. Governments focused instead on naval needs alone; R&amp;D defaulted to the defence agenda. The result is that a post-Brexit Britain would have no shipbuilding sector adapted to 21st-century markets. Instead, it would be closed for business.",

Another unexpected entrant to No 10 is the political secretary to the prime minister \u2013 Danny Kruger, who stood down as a Tory candidate in 2005 under Michael Howard after causing controversy by saying he thought there should be a \u201cperiod of creative destruction in the public services\u201d. He has since worked for the Legatum Institute, which has been influential among Brexiters; as a leader writer for the Daily Telegraph; and speechwriter for David Cameron in opposition. Kruger has suggested that cannabis should be decriminalised, as has Blair Gibbs, another former TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance staffer entering No 10 as a policy expert. Gibbs was poached from a current job leading policy at the Centre for Medicinal Cannabis, and has promoted the Canadian model of legalisation. Outside No 10, Liz Truss has handed her special adviser roles to two women from the world of rightwing thinktanks. Sophie Jarvis, a former Adam Smith Institute head of government and Evening Standard diary reporter, is her new trade policy adviser, while Nerissa Chesterfield has joined her as a media adviser from the Institute of Economic Affairs. However, Ryan Shorthouse, the director of the Bright Blue thinktank for liberal conservativism, said the new No 10 administration did not easily fit any one prescribed ideology. \u201cThe three priorities are more funding for the NHS, tax cuts for the lowest paid and a points-based immigration system. It will feel like that kind of white-van man, blue collar conservatism on steroids,\u201d he said. \u201cDominic Cummings is somebody who is very focused on that and thinks politically that is where the Tories need to pick up more votes. But it\u2019s very hard to put a label on him like libertarian or one nation. He is bothered about winning and appealing to the right type of voters.\u201d He said he believed there would be a \u201cmove fiscally to the left\u201d by ending austerity with more spending on police, the NHS and schools, combined with a relatively liberal approach to immigration and a more rightwing agenda in terms of cutting taxes. \u201cThe sort of hardline thing is Brexit and in terms of special advisers, Dominic wants true believers: leave-supporting special advisers in post and ministers completely signed up. It is a Vote Leave government,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson successfully captured the weekend headlines with his announcement of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/05/nhs-to-get-extra-18bn-even-under-no-deal-brexit-says-hancock\" title=\"\">\u00a31.8bn \u201ccash injection\u201d for the NHS</a> capital budget \u2013 which covers buildings and equipment. But the prime minister quickly became bogged down in allegations that the \u00a31bn pledged upfront this year wasn\u2019t quite the boost it appeared. The truth is that NHS leaders across the country won\u2019t see this billion as extra funding, but rather the removal of a freeze on cash they already have.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s because it matches a pot of cash that NHS trusts already earned last year, in return for stretching their efficiency to breaking point, on a subsequently broken promise that they could invest it.</p> \n<p>Three years ago, as overspends by hard-pressed trusts threatened to blow a hole in the entire health department budget, the Treasury devised a scheme that involved encouraging the minority of trusts who were able to break even to cut back further still, in order to deliver a surplus. That surplus would then offset the far bigger and unavoidable deficit that would be racked up by the rest.</p> \n<p>Trusts were asked to cut expenditure and make a surplus in return for receiving a cash reward \u2013 \u00a32.3bn in total over the last three years. Trusts weren\u2019t able to spend that cash on everyday expenditure, because that would defeat the object of reducing the deficit in day-to-day spending, but the cash could be used on capital investment: to repair dilapidated buildings, construct new wards and purchase updated equipment, from scanners to computer systems.</p> \n<p>For a lot of trusts, this was the reward they could promise staff and patients, who rightly asked why their local services were being squeezed more than the organisation\u2019s bottom line needed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e0c6a050-08f9-4be0-9c61-9f198c0cbcb9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dyZ69_F-nJU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Then came the catch. The Department of Health was happy to bank the trust efficiency savings and bask in the light of the multibillion-pound fix to NHS deficits. But when it came to trusts actually spending the cash they had earned through the scheme, the department realised it would bump into the Treasury\u2019s cap on investment spending. This restricts how much funding can actually leave the government\u2019s coffers each year, and for capital spending it has been squeezed after years of raids to fund the day-to-day budget.</p> \n<p>The Treasury has good reason for insisting on keeping a lid on this spending.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson successfully captured the weekend headlines with his announcement of a \u00a31.8bn \u201ccash injection\u201d for the NHS capital budget \u2013 which covers buildings and equipment. But the prime minister quickly became bogged down in allegations that the \u00a31bn pledged upfront this year wasn\u2019t quite the boost it appeared. The truth is that NHS leaders across the country won\u2019t see this billion as extra funding, but rather the removal of a freeze on cash they already have. That\u2019s because it matches a pot of cash that NHS trusts already earned last year, in return for stretching their efficiency to breaking point, on a subsequently broken promise that they could invest it. Three years ago, as overspends by hard-pressed trusts threatened to blow a hole in the entire health department budget, the Treasury devised a scheme that involved encouraging the minority of trusts who were able to break even to cut back further still, in order to deliver a surplus. That surplus would then offset the far bigger and unavoidable deficit that would be racked up by the rest. Trusts were asked to cut expenditure and make a surplus in return for receiving a cash reward \u2013 \u00a32.3bn in total over the last three years. Trusts weren\u2019t able to spend that cash on everyday expenditure, because that would defeat the object of reducing the deficit in day-to-day spending, but the cash could be used on capital investment: to repair dilapidated buildings, construct new wards and purchase updated equipment, from scanners to computer systems. For a lot of trusts, this was the reward they could promise staff and patients, who rightly asked why their local services were being squeezed more than the organisation\u2019s bottom line needed. Then came the catch. The Department of Health was happy to bank the trust efficiency savings and bask in the light of the multibillion-pound fix to NHS deficits. But when it came to trusts actually spending the cash they had earned through the scheme, the department realised it would bump into the Treasury\u2019s cap on investment spending. This restricts how much funding can actually leave the government\u2019s coffers each year, and for capital spending it has been squeezed after years of raids to fund the day-to-day budget. The Treasury has good reason for insisting on keeping a lid on this spending. The \u00a35.8bn cash sitting on NHS trust balance sheets after three years of the scheme might belong to those separate NHS trusts, but it is \u00a35.8bn of cash stored in the government\u2019s own bank account. If trusts can be stopped from spending that cash by curtailing the health department\u2019s spending limit, the Treasury can recycle it and spend elsewhere, instead of increasing taxes or borrowing. The fact that trusts had been promised they could spend it in return for having made steep cuts elsewhere got lost in the scramble to quickly cover up the growing hole in the NHS\u2019s finances. Over the last three years the resulting mess has been managed by the department using a mixture of cajoling, threats and direct orders to keep trusts from spending cash they had been promised they could invest. Last month, for example, NHS England wrote to trusts asking them to shave a fifth from their capital spending plans for 2019-20 \u2013 a figure that would come to about \u00a31bn. For this year at least, what the prime minister\u2019s announcement really means is simply reversing the broken promise made to trusts when they cut their costs in return for cash they were told they could spend. This is a good thing and it does really mean the NHS will be able to spend more on what patients need than it could have done before. But to claim this as a new money is a little like finally giving back the \u00a310 you borrowed some time ago \u2013 and expecting to be applauded wildly. \u2022 Sally Gainsbury is a senior policy analyst at Nuffield Trust",

There\u2019s hope that the constitutional atrocities planned by the prime minister and Downing Street\u2019s \u2018dark lord\u2019, Dominic Cummings, can and will be prevented by good MPs who will put saving the country ahead of their party. Most of these will be Labour, Scottish National party, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru, Green, Change UK and stray independents. But noblest of all will be Conservative MPs who, like the burghers of Calais (whose memorial they pass every day), will sacrifice their careers for the good of all. No \u201cgolden age\u201d awaits Johnson: he will be hoist on his own outrageous hubris. \u201cThe majority in parliament against no deal is bigger and more resolute than ever,\u201d says the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. The Tory rebels agree. They are aghast at the arrogant strutting of Cummings who is, says one, the best recruiting sergeant for rebellion on the Tory backbenches. The No 10 supremo\u2019s careless contempt affronts many Tory MPs \u2013 and he is defiantly in contempt of parliament. The cabinet of sycophants, signed up to no deal in blood to get their jobs, are told to say nothing without permission from No 10 \u2013 that is, Cummings.

That political dynamic shows no signs of changing.</p> \n<p>Shortly after Trump spoke, authorities said another person had died from injuries sustained during the mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso on Saturday, raising the death toll in that attack to 22. El Paso police tweeted that the latest victim died early Monday morning at a hospital.

His words could not be more hollow. He says \u201cwe must condemn racism, bigotry and white nationalism\u201d \u2013 but often serves as their national spokesperson. In this national emergency, our president is morally bankrupt. We deserve better.\u201d</p> \n<p>Twenty-one people were killed and another 26 injured in El Paso, which sits along the southern border and is heavily populated by immigrants. Authorities said at least six of the deceased were Mexican nationals.</p> \n<p>The details of the El Paso shooting, at a popular shopping center on Saturday morning, were still being learned when another massacre unfolded overnight.</p> \n<p>In a matter of 32 seconds, a gunman in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine and wounded at least 27 more on a busy street in the early hours of Sunday. The suspect, whose victims included his own sister, was killed by police when they arrived at the scene.</p> \n<p>The events kicked off an all-too-familiar debate over gun violence in America, which claims roughly 100 lives each day.</p> \n<p>Trump has reneged on previous pledges to strengthen gun laws. After other mass shootings he called for strengthening the federal background check system, and in 2018 he signed legislation to increase federal agency data sharing into the system. But he has resisted Democratic calls to toughen other gun control laws.</p> \n<p>In February, the House approved bipartisan legislation to require federal background checks for all gun sales and transfers and approved legislation to allow a review period of up to 10 days for background checks on firearms purchases. The White House threatened a presidential veto if those measures passed Congress.</p> \n<p>At a February meeting with survivors and family members of the 2018 Parkland, Florida, school shooting in which 17 people died, Trump promised to be \u201cvery strong on background checks\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump claimed he would stand up to the gun lobby, but he later retreated, expressing support for modest changes to the federal background check system and for arming teachers.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Trump\u2019s speech drew on ideas that Republicans in Congress can embrace without confronting the gun lobby or restricting access to weapons.</p> \n<p>Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and a Trump ally, has raised concerns about violence in video games, while another Trump confidant, Senator Lindsey Graham, tweeted his support over the weekend for his own red flag mental health bill.</p> \n<p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has blamed \u201cthe glorification of violence\u201d in a speech that identified video games, the internet and mental illness \u2013 but not guns \u2013 as the cause of the slaughter that left at least 31 dead and 53 injured in less than 24 hours over the weekend. In his first public remarks on the pair of shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Trump also condemned white supremacy as authorities said they were investigating an anti-Hispanic, anti-immigrant manifesto allegedly tied to the El Paso suspect. \u201cThe shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy.\u201d \u201cThese sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America.\u201d Noticeably absent from the president\u2019s remarks was any mention of new restrictions on guns, despite the fact that just hours earlier Trump had urged the US Congress in a tweet to pass some form of background checks. Congress has proven unable to pass substantial gun violence legislation this session, despite the frequency of mass shootings, in large part because of resistance from Republicans, particularly in the Republican-controlled Senate. That political dynamic shows no signs of changing. Shortly after Trump spoke, authorities said another person had died from injuries sustained during the mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso on Saturday, raising the death toll in that attack to 22. El Paso police tweeted that the latest victim died early Monday morning at a hospital. No other details were immediately provided. Speaking from the White House, Trump called for \u201creal bipartisan solutions\u201d but pointedly attempted to steer the dialogue away from firearms. \u201cMental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,\u201d Trump said, while calling for reforms that \u201cbetter identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence\u201d. He said authorities should \u201cmake sure those people not only get treatment, but, when necessary, involuntary confinement\u201d, but did not elaborate. The president also said he was directing the justice department to draw up a proposal that would swiftly deliver the death penalty to those who commit hate crimes and mass murders, so that capital punishment could be rendered \u201cquickly, decisively and without years of needless delay\u201d. Trump further revived the widely debunked theory that video games were a factor in mass shootings, condemning \u201cthe gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace\u201d. \u201cIt is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately.\u201d The president\u2019s comments came hours after he suggested lawmakers in Washington link background checks legislation to \u201cdesperately needed immigration reform\u201d, drawing criticism for invoking immigration policy after one of the shootings targeted the predominantly Latino community of El Paso. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks, perhaps marrying this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWe must have something good, if not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events!\u201d Trump also took aim at the media in his tweets, claiming \u201cfake news\u201d had played a role in the current climate. \u201cThe Media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our Country,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cFake News has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years. \u201cNews coverage has got to start being fair, balanced and unbiased, or these terrible problems will only get worse!\u201d The mayor of El Paso confirmed that the president would be visiting the city on Wednesday. Top Democrats swiftly condemned Trump\u2019s initial response to the shootings, with some drawing comparisons to Nazi Germany. \u201cWhat\u2019s [the] connection between background checks &amp; immigration reform? That we have to keep guns out of the hands out of the invading hordes?\u201d the House judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, said in an interview with MSNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting. It reminds me of the 1930s in Germany.\u201d The 2020 presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, a native of El Paso, also likened Trump\u2019s comments to Nazi Germany: \u201cThe only modern western democracy that I can think of that said anything close to this is the Third Reich, Nazi Germany.\u201d Another Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, Juli\u00e1n Castro, said: \u201cDonald Trump is unfit to lead our nation. His words could not be more hollow. He says \u201cwe must condemn racism, bigotry and white nationalism\u201d \u2013 but often serves as their national spokesperson. In this national emergency, our president is morally bankrupt. We deserve better.\u201d Twenty-one people were killed and another 26 injured in El Paso, which sits along the southern border and is heavily populated by immigrants. Authorities said at least six of the deceased were Mexican nationals. The details of the El Paso shooting, at a popular shopping center on Saturday morning, were still being learned when another massacre unfolded overnight. In a matter of 32 seconds, a gunman in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine and wounded at least 27 more on a busy street in the early hours of Sunday. The suspect, whose victims included his own sister, was killed by police when they arrived at the scene. The events kicked off an all-too-familiar debate over gun violence in America, which claims roughly 100 lives each day. Trump has reneged on previous pledges to strengthen gun laws. After other mass shootings he called for strengthening the federal background check system, and in 2018 he signed legislation to increase federal agency data sharing into the system. But he has resisted Democratic calls to toughen other gun control laws. In February, the House approved bipartisan legislation to require federal background checks for all gun sales and transfers and approved legislation to allow a review period of up to 10 days for background checks on firearms purchases. The White House threatened a presidential veto if those measures passed Congress. At a February meeting with survivors and family members of the 2018 Parkland, Florida, school shooting in which 17 people died, Trump promised to be \u201cvery strong on background checks\u201d. Trump claimed he would stand up to the gun lobby, but he later retreated, expressing support for modest changes to the federal background check system and for arming teachers. On Monday, Trump\u2019s speech drew on ideas that Republicans in Congress can embrace without confronting the gun lobby or restricting access to weapons. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and a Trump ally, has raised concerns about violence in video games, while another Trump confidant, Senator Lindsey Graham, tweeted his support over the weekend for his own red flag mental health bill.

      "body": "<p>D\u00f3ra Maurer\u2019s impressive creativity since the end of Soviet control and communist one-party rule in Hungary in 1989 is an exception to a dispiriting rule. Many creative artists whose imaginations rebelled against the communist states of eastern Europe faded after their countries became democratic. Was the challenge of dissidence a spur to creativity? Or is capitalist democracy destructive in its own banal, populist way? The novels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/milankundera\">Milan Kundera</a> and films of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jan-svankmajer\">Jan \u0160vankmajer</a> are examples of that lost urgency, and \u2013 in \u0160vankmajer\u2019s case \u2013 funding, after the fall of communism. So it\u2019s heartening that Maurer, who spent much of her life making dissident art in a totalitarian state, has done her best work since that state collapsed.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth looking at her artistic life backwards. Go right to the end of Tate Modern\u2019s enlightening, and free, survey of her subversive career to be delighted by the paintings she does today. Maurer\u2019s flights of colour include interleaving waves of blue, green and yellow, curves of red rushing towards blue and orange rectangles, and interlapping grids of too many colours to count. The most recent of these joyous paintings that spin off across walls and around corners as they defy the idea of a closed picture surface is dated 2016. Maurer, born in 1937 in Budapest, is in the swim of creativity today and producing paintings that are simultaneously installations, with hard, bright geometries knocked sideways by some crazy libertarian impulse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d6c87d80a065d9758884151d65a27f4645719932\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6c87d80a065d9758884151d65a27f4645719932/0_0_2017_2686/751.jpg\" alt=\"Seven Foldings 1975, by D\u00f3ra Maurer\" width=\"751\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veil of grey ...

The birth of conceptual art in the late 1960s was inspired by mayhem on the streets. While 1968 saw revolutions in Paris and Prague, artists rejected the commodified art object and declared that art could be a walk, a verbal proposition, or in Maurer\u2019s case, a paving stone. Her 1971 work What Can One Do with a Paving Stone? is a sequence of black and white photographs of her playing with a slab of stone on a river bank. She wraps it, unwraps it, cradles it and ties it up. Just as British artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/richard-long\">Richard Long</a> was making temporary arrangements of sticks and stones, Maurer used this found object to create an ephemeral interactive sculpture. But a paving stone is not a pile of pebbles. It was a symbol of revolution: paving stones were often ripped up and thrown in street protests.</p> <p>The Hungarian revolution against the Soviet-imposed regime in 1956 had been so brutally crushed that even in the 1970s it took courage to hint at rebellion. Maurer\u2019s dissident art finds freedom in using unlikely materials in cussedly individualist ways. To create her 1975 print Seven Foldings, she scratched and bent a metal printmaking plate then covered it in ink and printed from it. The image she made of this ruined object is a curiously beautiful veil of grey interrupted by slanting black bars.</p> <p>Maurer made her art with kitchen-table methods that rejected the system and refused to participate in it. Yet the results have a haunting, formal beauty. In her black and white films, she watches shadows on a cup, folds in cloth or spins her camera round her flat. The rudimentary methods produce elegant and witty results. You can see how this art grew out of resistance. To create beauty with a bit of wire or make a film in your kitchen is to win a secret space of freedom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f1774594f03a264bf616b85238a4822bae7b9d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f1774594f03a264bf616b85238a4822bae7b9d4/0_0_3956_5512/718.jpg\" alt=\"Space Painting, 1984\u201396, by D\u00f3ra Maurer\" width=\"718\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dynamic ...

In two layers of photographs we see two photographers running along opposite balconies of a block of flats in Budapest, snapping each other as they go. It\u2019s like a communist version of Ed Ruscha\u2019s photobook <a href=\"https://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/worksofart/every-building-on-the-sunset-strip/\">Every Building on the Sunset Strip</a>, except instead of motels and gas stations we see grey ranks of flats.</p> <p>As the cold war approached its close in the 1980s, and with travel between east and west easier, Maurer discovered a new way to be free. In 1983, she was commissioned to paint in a medieval tower in Buchberg in Austria. She invented what she calls \u201cspace paintings\u201d, dynamic installations that are half way between canvas and mural \u2013 and she hasn\u2019t looked back. The passion for geometric design and love of disorder that collide in her conceptual art are indulged with glorious energy in her paintings.</p> <p>In today\u2019s anxious world, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/05/child-thrown-from-tate-modern-in-critical-but-stable-condition\">even a museum on a Sunday afternoon is not a safe</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/05/child-thrown-from-tate-modern-in-critical-but-stable-condition\"> space</a>, it\u2019s a joy to see this optimistic art.

Go right to the end of Tate Modern\u2019s enlightening, and free, survey of her subversive career to be delighted by the paintings she does today. Maurer\u2019s flights of colour include interleaving waves of blue, green and yellow, curves of red rushing towards blue and orange rectangles, and interlapping grids of too many colours to count. The most recent of these joyous paintings that spin off across walls and around corners as they defy the idea of a closed picture surface is dated 2016. Maurer, born in 1937 in Budapest, is in the swim of creativity today and producing paintings that are simultaneously installations, with hard, bright geometries knocked sideways by some crazy libertarian impulse. Not that her early experiments are ever less than intelligent. The birth of conceptual art in the late 1960s was inspired by mayhem on the streets. While 1968 saw revolutions in Paris and Prague, artists rejected the commodified art object and declared that art could be a walk, a verbal proposition, or in Maurer\u2019s case, a paving stone. Her 1971 work What Can One Do with a Paving Stone? is a sequence of black and white photographs of her playing with a slab of stone on a river bank. She wraps it, unwraps it, cradles it and ties it up. Just as British artist Richard Long was making temporary arrangements of sticks and stones, Maurer used this found object to create an ephemeral interactive sculpture. But a paving stone is not a pile of pebbles. It was a symbol of revolution: paving stones were often ripped up and thrown in street protests. The Hungarian revolution against the Soviet-imposed regime in 1956 had been so brutally crushed that even in the 1970s it took courage to hint at rebellion. Maurer\u2019s dissident art finds freedom in using unlikely materials in cussedly individualist ways. To create her 1975 print Seven Foldings, she scratched and bent a metal printmaking plate then covered it in ink and printed from it. The image she made of this ruined object is a curiously beautiful veil of grey interrupted by slanting black bars. Maurer made her art with kitchen-table methods that rejected the system and refused to participate in it. Yet the results have a haunting, formal beauty. In her black and white films, she watches shadows on a cup, folds in cloth or spins her camera round her flat. The rudimentary methods produce elegant and witty results. You can see how this art grew out of resistance. To create beauty with a bit of wire or make a film in your kitchen is to win a secret space of freedom. The work that most vividly evokes that atmosphere of underground fun is Maurer\u2019s 1977 piece Parallel Lines, Analyses. In two layers of photographs we see two photographers running along opposite balconies of a block of flats in Budapest, snapping each other as they go. It\u2019s like a communist version of Ed Ruscha\u2019s photobook Every Building on the Sunset Strip, except instead of motels and gas stations we see grey ranks of flats. As the cold war approached its close in the 1980s, and with travel between east and west easier, Maurer discovered a new way to be free. In 1983, she was commissioned to paint in a medieval tower in Buchberg in Austria. She invented what she calls \u201cspace paintings\u201d, dynamic installations that are half way between canvas and mural \u2013 and she hasn\u2019t looked back. The passion for geometric design and love of disorder that collide in her conceptual art are indulged with glorious energy in her paintings. In today\u2019s anxious world, where even a museum on a Sunday afternoon is not a safe space, it\u2019s a joy to see this optimistic art. You could almost come away with the idea that the world has got better, not worse, in recent decades. \u2022 At Tate Modern, London, until 5 July.",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills.

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This has been no secret, but rather a longterm and explicit goal of the BJP.

It features Madhu, a woman whose head has been stolen by her obsessive lover. She is awaiting the arrival of \u201can idiot of a photographer\u201d who wants to capture her and \u201call the wonderful and vicious things that happened along the Indian coastline\u201d.</p> <p>The images that follow are indeed wonderful and vicious, almost hallucinatory in their intensity: lovers embrace, angry men come to blows, revellers are caught in closeup, eyes bloodshot, faces daubed with powdered paint, lips smeared with lipstick. Moments of violence are caught in the flashbulb\u2019s glare: a machete drips blood on a bare foot, a man holds a brick above another man he has pinned to the pavement, a woman stares in terror at something \u2013 or someone \u2013 just out of the frame.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was tapping into the discomfort I was feeling wandering the streets at night, but also as someone immersed in the language of social media.

In its raw immediacy, the book reflects what he describes as \u201cthe non-aesthetic of so many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/14/future-photography-in-the-age-of-instagram-essay-sean-o-hagan\">images uploaded on social media</a>, which has now become an aesthetic in itself\u201d. The result is one of the most powerfully unsettling photobooks of the year.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the images in the book are real,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut I have messed around with them afterwards.

He has a degree in economics and describes his upbringing as \u201cprivileged \u2013 like most Indian photographers\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Sohrab Hura\u2019s photobook, The Coast, begins with a fantastical short story written by him. It features Madhu, a woman whose head has been stolen by her obsessive lover. She is awaiting the arrival of \u201can idiot of a photographer\u201d who wants to capture her and \u201call the wonderful and vicious things that happened along the Indian coastline\u201d. The images that follow are indeed wonderful and vicious, almost hallucinatory in their intensity: lovers embrace, angry men come to blows, revellers are caught in closeup, eyes bloodshot, faces daubed with powdered paint, lips smeared with lipstick. Moments of violence are caught in the flashbulb\u2019s glare: a machete drips blood on a bare foot, a man holds a brick above another man he has pinned to the pavement, a woman stares in terror at something \u2013 or someone \u2013 just out of the frame. Throughout, Hura merges the real and the fictional, the found and the constructed, his harsh, unforgiving flash illuminating what he calls \u201cthe loneliness and suspicion of the Indian night\u201d. In its raw immediacy, the book reflects what he describes as \u201cthe non-aesthetic of so many of the images uploaded on social media, which has now become an aesthetic in itself\u201d. The result is one of the most powerfully unsettling photobooks of the year. \u201cMany of the images in the book are real,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut I have messed around with them afterwards. I have also witnessed and tried to defuse real fights. So, some of it is theatre, some of it real-life drama. I\u2019m playing with ideas of voyeurism and trust, manipulating the viewer. Nothing is definite, everything is raw and overwhelming. This is the image world we now live in.\u201d The idiot photographer mocked by his character, Madhu \u2013 \u201cWhy on Earth would anybody waste time on something like this?\u201d \u2013 is, of course Hura himself, but also, he tells me, the voyeuristic viewer. \u201cIn a way, I was tapping into the discomfort I was feeling both as a photographer wandering the streets at night, but also as someone immersed in the image language of social media \u2013 what is right, what is wrong, what is true, what is fake?

Monzo insisted that no one outside the bank had access to the pins and said it had no evidence suggesting the data was misused. \u201cWe\u2019ve checked all the accounts that have been affected by this bug thoroughly, and confirmed the information hasn\u2019t been used to commit fraud,\u201d Monzo said in a blogpost. \u201cJust in case, we\u2019ve messaged everyone that\u2019s been affected to let them know they should change their pin by going to a cash machine.\u201d The bank also sent emails to potentially affected customers on Monday, apologising for having mismanaged the sensitive data. While the issue is said to have been resolved, it is one of the worst IT problems to hit the app-only bank since its launch in 2015. Last week Monzo was affected by a temporary outage that meant some card purchases were failing to go through. Others were unable to login or receive bank transfers. The brand, known for its hot coral pink cards, is particularly popular among millennials in the south-east but is quickly spreading across the UK. With plans to expand to the US its chief executive, Tom Blomfield, expects the bank to grow to 3 million customers in a matter of months. Blomfield\u2019s growth plans have been fuelled by a fresh round of funding announced in June, which helped Monzo double in value to \u00a32bn.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It follows a security crackdown in Indian-administered Kashmir, where extra troops have been deployed and thousands of pilgrims and tourists were abruptly evacuated at the weekend.</p> \n<p>In the early hours of Monday, Kashmiri leaders said they had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/kashmir-leaders-placed-under-arrest-amid-security-crackdown\">placed under house arrest</a>, internet and phone coverage to Kashmir valley was cut, public gatherings were banned and schools closed.</p> \n<p>The government sought to revoke the state\u2019s special status through a presidential order on Monday, which will be voted on by the lower house of parliament, controlled by Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).

      "bodyText": "Labour anti-Brexit activists will lead another push to harden the party\u2019s position in favour of remain at Labour\u2019s annual conference this year, with local parties urged to submit motions committing the party to \u201ccampaign energetically\u201d for a second referendum. Grassroots activists, including the pro-remain groups Another Europe is Possible and the youth group For our Future\u2019s Sake (FFS), were behind a major push at last year\u2019s conference in Liverpool which compelled the party to adopt a position that a public vote on Brexit should be an option if a general election could not be forced. A record number of constituency Labour parties, more than 100 in total, submitted conference motions last year calling for a public vote to become Labour policy, though organisers behind this year\u2019s push said their efforts were unlikely to produce such numbers again, with competition from other popular motions including on Green New Deal. Another Europe is Possible, the leftwing anti-Brexit group which was a major driver behind the motions to conference last year, said they had received assurances that at least 40 local parties were planning to submit a motion on remaining in the EU. Michael Chessum, the group\u2019s national organiser said conference was \u201ctaking place on the edge of the cliff\u201d and said activists would no longer accept a compromise composite motion like the one brokered last year when members agreed to the wording that \u201cLabour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\u201d. \u201cIf it really does come down to a vote on conference floor, we can expect the debate to be sharp,\u201d Chessum said. \u201cWith Labour already committed to a public vote and an option to remain, we have no incentive to accept a fudge \u2013 and we can expect overwhelming support from members, as well as significant union backing. Ultimately, Labour needs to be able to answer the question: \u2018Do you want to stop Brexit or deliver it?\u2019\u201d The group has been phone-banking contacts in constituency Labour parties since June to persuade local parties to submit their motion, containing the line \u2013 \u201cLabour will campaign energetically for a public vote and to remain. We support revoking article 50 if necessary to prevent no deal.\u201d Though the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has committed to holding a public vote and campaigning to remain on any Conservative-brokered Brexit deal, as well as holding a referendum should his party get into power before any EU exit, the new motion would go substantially further than any Labour policy. It would commit the party to proactively campaigning for a referendum, as well as campaigning for remain on any deal, including one clinched by a Labour government, as well as backing revoking article 50 as a measure to stop no deal. The final clause in particular is likely to be robustly opposed by some Labour MPs in leave seats. Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis, who is backing the motion, said the party needed to ensure its Brexit position was crystal clear before conference starts. \u201cEither we can disappoint our leave voters on Brexit and win them back with a radical domestic programme, or we can fudge the issue, lose our base and watch as the free-market Brexit dream becomes a reality and demolishes the welfare state,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt would be better for everyone if this shift happened in advance of conference \u2013 not forced by members but owned by the leadership, as part of a serious strategy to stop Boris Johnson, ditch Brexit and rebuild Britain instead.\u201d Sources behind the drive to harden Labour policy said the circumstances had fundamentally changed since last year\u2019s conference, including much firmer support from trade unions for a public vote, as well as from the shadow cabinet. However, CLPs are only permitted to put forward one conference motion and anti-Brexit activists pushing the motions concede many are unlikely to want to submit a motion on the same topic as last year. One popular alternative motion, endorsed by Momentum, commits Labour to a Green New Deal which some activists are wary about competing with. Nadia Whittome, a member of Another Europe\u2019s national committee, said they did not want to view it as an arms race. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that Brexit\u2019s biggest cheerleaders are rightwing climate change deniers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe welcome the fact that this year\u2019s conference will see a renewed wave of motions on all kinds of issues, especially on the environment. In fact our motion will also include a call for a Europe-wide Green New Deal because saving the planet is one of the main reasons why we need to stop Brexit, Johnson and Trump.\u201d FFS, which is linked to the main People\u2019s Vote campaign, has also been canvassing CLPs to submit their version of an anti-Brexit motion, which commits Labour unequivocally to a public vote. It seeks pledges that \u201cLabour will now throw the full weight of our movement behind efforts to secure a confirmatory vote \u2026 If a general election is held, the Labour manifesto must include a commitment to a confirmatory referendum with remain on the ballot.\u201d A People\u2019s Vote rally is planned for weekend of Labour conference in Brighton, as well as a youth and student rally on the Monday.

The unrest is now in its ninth week. It has evolved from limited, student-led opposition to a proposed extradition law into a broad-based, fully fledged challenge to Beijing\u2019s rule. It is threatening to undermine China\u2019s control of the former British colony and President Xi Jinping\u2019s control of China. His quasi-dictatorial authority is on the line. A critical tipping point is in sight.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>How long before China\u2019s tough-guy leader, accustomed to getting his way and not averse to using force, loses patience?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>How long before China\u2019s tough-guy leader, a man accustomed to getting his way and not averse to using force, loses patience? How much longer can angry People\u2019s Liberation Army generals be restrained? The Hong Kong garrison commander last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/hong-kong-protests-china-military-breaks-silence-to-warn-unrest-will-not-be-tolerated\" title=\"\">chillingly advertised</a> his determination \u201cto protect national sovereignty, security and stability\u201d. And if a harsh military crackdown is ordered, and people begin to die in large numbers, what will Britain and the west do?</p> \n<p>These questions are critical, because the struggle over Hong Kong\u2019s future has far-reaching international ramifications \u2013 symbolic, political and practical. The crushing of its freedoms would be a grim triumph for the advancing forces of global authoritarianism. The economic impact on already volatile world markets and trade, where Hong Kong\u2019s role is central, could be massively disruptive. And it would raise fundamental questions about the Xi ascendancy and China\u2019s direction of travel.</p> \n<p>If only for that last factor, it seems clear Xi will not resort to force, and de facto direct rule from Beijing, unless he feels he has no choice. He knows the outcome of such action would definitively give the lie to the favourite Communist party conceit of China\u2019s \u201cpeaceful rise\u201d. Xi knows the overseas repercussions could be immensely damaging, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/hong-kong-protests-china-military-breaks-silence-to-warn-unrest-will-not-be-tolerated\" title=\"\">dwarfing in intensity</a> the criticism of the abuses endured by Xinjiang\u2019s Muslim Uighurs.</p> \n<p>But it is also clear that the fury and frustration felt in Beijing is close to boiling point. There have been dozens of official warnings in recent weeks about the necessity of enforcing a harsh policy of \u201czero tolerance\u201d, and of how the protests challenge \u201cthe bottom line of the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 formula\u201d. With Hong Kong at a defiant standstill on Monday, the angry rhetoric took on an even <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1156439.shtml\" title=\"\">more threatening tone</a>.</p> \n<p>China\u2019s outraged Hong Kong and Macao affairs office claimed, for example, that black-clad, masked protestors in Tsim Sha Tsui, in Kowloon, had flung the Chinese national flag into the harbour. \u201cTheir conduct has blatantly offended the state and national dignity \u2026 and greatly hurt the feelings of the entire Chinese people,\u201d it said. \u201cThe central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-08/04/c_138283162.htm\" title=\"\">the Xinhua news agency said</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/aug/05/violence-strikes-and-chaos-as-protests-sweep-hong-kong-in-pictures\">Violence, strikes and chaos as protests sweep Hong Kong \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The reappearance in public of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, after an absence of two weeks, may be significant. Xi and other senior cadres in Beijing have hidden behind Lam since the unrest began, letting her take the flak, even though, in proposing the extradition law and generally chipping away at Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, she has faithfully followed the party line. Xi does not want Lam\u2019s resignation, because that would be seen as a concession and sign of weakness \u2013 and could expose him personally to political fallout. Instead, Lam was sent out to face the media on Monday, lacking new ideas about how to defuse the crisis and peddling an uncompromising message.</p> \n<p>\u201cSuch extensive disruptions in the name of certain demands or noncooperation have seriously undermined Hong Kong law and order and are pushing our city \u2026 to the verge of a very dangerous situation,\u201d Lam said.</p> \n<p>This was no random choice of words, rather a script approved in Beijing. Xi did not reach the top of the pile by tolerating \u201cvery dangerous situations\u201d. When all is said and done, his is still the unrepentant party of Tiananmen Square, ruling from the barrel of a gun.</p> \n<p>The potential for a violent Hong Kong security crackdown to trigger a truly international crisis is plainly growing. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s embarrassing dressing-down by China\u2019s ambassador, when he was foreign secretary, showed how little Britain could do in such circumstances \u2013 whatever the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration may stipulate.

      "bodyText": "As pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong escalate, so does China\u2019s fury. The unrest is now in its ninth week. It has evolved from limited, student-led opposition to a proposed extradition law into a broad-based, fully fledged challenge to Beijing\u2019s rule. It is threatening to undermine China\u2019s control of the former British colony and President Xi Jinping\u2019s control of China. His quasi-dictatorial authority is on the line. A critical tipping point is in sight. How long before China\u2019s tough-guy leader, a man accustomed to getting his way and not averse to using force, loses patience? How much longer can angry People\u2019s Liberation Army generals be restrained? The Hong Kong garrison commander last week chillingly advertised his determination \u201cto protect national sovereignty, security and stability\u201d. And if a harsh military crackdown is ordered, and people begin to die in large numbers, what will Britain and the west do? These questions are critical, because the struggle over Hong Kong\u2019s future has far-reaching international ramifications \u2013 symbolic, political and practical. The crushing of its freedoms would be a grim triumph for the advancing forces of global authoritarianism. The economic impact on already volatile world markets and trade, where Hong Kong\u2019s role is central, could be massively disruptive. And it would raise fundamental questions about the Xi ascendancy and China\u2019s direction of travel. If only for that last factor, it seems clear Xi will not resort to force, and de facto direct rule from Beijing, unless he feels he has no choice. He knows the outcome of such action would definitively give the lie to the favourite Communist party conceit of China\u2019s \u201cpeaceful rise\u201d. Xi knows the overseas repercussions could be immensely damaging, dwarfing in intensity the criticism of the abuses endured by Xinjiang\u2019s Muslim Uighurs. But it is also clear that the fury and frustration felt in Beijing is close to boiling point. There have been dozens of official warnings in recent weeks about the necessity of enforcing a harsh policy of \u201czero tolerance\u201d, and of how the protests challenge \u201cthe bottom line of the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 formula\u201d. With Hong Kong at a defiant standstill on Monday, the angry rhetoric took on an even more threatening tone. China\u2019s outraged Hong Kong and Macao affairs office claimed, for example, that black-clad, masked protestors in Tsim Sha Tsui, in Kowloon, had flung the Chinese national flag into the harbour. \u201cTheir conduct has blatantly offended the state and national dignity \u2026 and greatly hurt the feelings of the entire Chinese people,\u201d it said. \u201cThe central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue,\u201d the Xinhua news agency said. The reappearance in public of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, after an absence of two weeks, may be significant. Xi and other senior cadres in Beijing have hidden behind Lam since the unrest began, letting her take the flak, even though, in proposing the extradition law and generally chipping away at Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, she has faithfully followed the party line. Xi does not want Lam\u2019s resignation, because that would be seen as a concession and sign of weakness \u2013 and could expose him personally to political fallout. Instead, Lam was sent out to face the media on Monday, lacking new ideas about how to defuse the crisis and peddling an uncompromising message. \u201cSuch extensive disruptions in the name of certain demands or noncooperation have seriously undermined Hong Kong law and order and are pushing our city \u2026 to the verge of a very dangerous situation,\u201d Lam said. This was no random choice of words, rather a script approved in Beijing. Xi did not reach the top of the pile by tolerating \u201cvery dangerous situations\u201d. When all is said and done, his is still the unrepentant party of Tiananmen Square, ruling from the barrel of a gun. The potential for a violent Hong Kong security crackdown to trigger a truly international crisis is plainly growing. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s embarrassing dressing-down by China\u2019s ambassador, when he was foreign secretary, showed how little Britain could do in such circumstances \u2013 whatever the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration may stipulate. But as notional guarantor of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and self-designated promoter of western democracy, Britain would surely be obliged to do something. Here would be yet another crisis for which Boris Johnson\u2019s government is unprepared, and unfitted, to deal with. Has anybody in Beijing ever heard of Dominic Raab, Hunt\u2019s successor at the Foreign Office? What chance a favourable post-Brexit trade deal with China in such tainted circumstances? A crackdown would signal the final demise of the already tarnished Cameron-Osborne \u201cgolden era\u201d in bilateral relations, and with it all hope of significant, sustained Chinese inward investment. Hong Kong could also prove a catalyst for a wider collision with Donald Trump\u2019s United States. An unnerving confluence of events, including last week\u2019s sudden threat of additional, punitive US tariffs and the ongoing row over American attempts to ostracise the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has already sparked a significant sell-off and instability in global financial markets. The Trump administration is increasingly at odds with China over its militarisation of the South China Sea, its ignoring of the US embargo on Iranian oil imports, its continuing support for North Korea\u2019s nuclear-armed dictator, its so-called debt diplomacy in Africa and Latin America, and its \u201csinicisation\u201d of religion, not solely in Xinjiang. China in turn accuses the US and Britain of fomenting the Hong Kong unrest and plotting against it. Add to all this Xi\u2019s belief that quasi-independent Taiwan, armed and succoured by Trump, has been emboldened in its \u201csplittist\u201d tendencies, and it\u2019s not hard to see how the building anger in Beijing could yet trigger a bigger, more dangerous detonation. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",

The ECB director of women\u2019s cricket, Clare Connor, admitted the disparity between the sides\u2019 domestic structures was a \u201cbig contributing factor\u201d to the defeat.</p> <p>Since August 2017, professional contracts have been provided to all Australian women\u2019s state players, while the English women\u2019s county set-up has remained amateur. However, the ECB will invest \u00a320m into women\u2019s and girls\u2019 cricket over the next two years to establish the centres of excellence made up of a consortium of several counties in each region. For example, Middlesex will host the London and East centre, which is likely to include players from Essex, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/03/australias-womens-ashes-dominance-was-surprising-given-recent-tussles-with-england\">Australia\u2019s Women\u2019s Ashes dominance was surprising given recent tussles with England | Megan Schutt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The centres, which will be set up in October and also have feeder academies, will provide year-round training and coaching support for domestic players, who will become semi-professional. The centres will play each other in their 50-over and 20-over competitions.</p> <p>In an email sent to the counties last week and seen by the Guardian, Connor states the eight centres will \u201cgeographically align with the eight women\u2019s teams that will compete in The Hundred\u201d and that coaching and support staff will be sub-contracted to the Hundred franchises.</p> <p>This appears to confirm the Women\u2019s Hundred teams will have their home at different grounds to the men: for example Taunton is likely to host to both the \u201cWestern Fire\u201d Women\u2019s Hundred side and the \u201cSouth West and Wales\u201d centre of excellence whereas the men will be based in Cardiff.</p> <p>The email also confirms the ECB, having threatened to withdraw funding from women\u2019s county cricket, will continue to run a women\u2019s county Twenty20 competition next year and 2021.</p> <p>Richard Bedbrook, the coach of Surrey Women and the Surrey Stars KSL team, says the changes are \u201cvery exciting\u201d. He said: \u201cIt will allow players the opportunity of really taking the next steps, from all their cricketing skills to their physical condition to then hopefully bridging the gap with the mental side of it, and allowing them to challenge for the England squad.</p> <p>\u201cIf you keep streamlining the talent pool, you create more competition because the teams are much more evenly balanced. The games are played between the best players at the highest standard and therefore more pressure moments occur.\u201d</p> <p>For the England squad, who spend all their time in a \u201cLoughborough bubble\u201d, the centres will provide a much-needed fresh environment. For domestic players, who have always had to juggle work or study with cricket while receiving no remuneration, the revamp is also welcome.</p> <p>\u201cYou put in so much effort for so many years, and the fact that now you might actually get a chance to be rewarded for your efforts all year round and become that bit more professional is amazing,\u201d said the 24-year-old batter Aylish Cranstone, who plays for Surrey at county level and in the KSL.</p> <p>There remains widespread concern about the replacement of the Super League with the Women\u2019s Hundred. The KSL attracted more than 40,000 fans to matches across the past two seasons, including two sellout Finals Days at Hove. Players such as Kirstie Gordon, Sophia Dunkley and most recently Mady Villiers have made international debuts largely as a result of impressive performances in the Super League.</p> <p>Cranstone feels she has benefitted enormously from \u201cbeing around high-level players \u2013 seeing how they train, how they go about things and how they deal with high-pressure situations\u201d and admits she is concerned about the future.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken a few years to get a real fanbase,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Surrey fans and they\u2019ll always be loyal to Surrey but for the other franchises, say Western Storm or Loughborough Lightning, they\u2019ve really gained a fan base that will just come to see them. So it\u2019s upsetting that that\u2019s grown year on year and developed, and that\u2019s now not going to be there any more.\u201d</p> <p>Another area of concern is the lack of information provided to players regarding the amount they can expect to earn and the time commitment required should they win a place at one of the centres. Katie Levick, the Yorkshire Diamonds leg-spinner who juggles cricket with her role as a marketing manager, said: \u201cIt\u2019s causing a few headaches from a work perspective!\u201d</p> <p>One thing is certain. The changes represent the biggest shake-up domestic women\u2019s cricket in England has ever seen. The final season of the KSL looks set to be given added impetus as players seek to make their case for inclusion in the new semi-professional setup.</p>",

With women\u2019s cricket under the microscope after England were dismantled in the Ashes series, a lot is riding on the success of the changes. The ECB director of women\u2019s cricket, Clare Connor, admitted the disparity between the sides\u2019 domestic structures was a \u201cbig contributing factor\u201d to the defeat. Since August 2017, professional contracts have been provided to all Australian women\u2019s state players, while the English women\u2019s county set-up has remained amateur. However, the ECB will invest \u00a320m into women\u2019s and girls\u2019 cricket over the next two years to establish the centres of excellence made up of a consortium of several counties in each region. For example, Middlesex will host the London and East centre, which is likely to include players from Essex, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. The centres, which will be set up in October and also have feeder academies, will provide year-round training and coaching support for domestic players, who will become semi-professional. The centres will play each other in their 50-over and 20-over competitions. In an email sent to the counties last week and seen by the Guardian, Connor states the eight centres will \u201cgeographically align with the eight women\u2019s teams that will compete in The Hundred\u201d and that coaching and support staff will be sub-contracted to the Hundred franchises. This appears to confirm the Women\u2019s Hundred teams will have their home at different grounds to the men: for example Taunton is likely to host to both the \u201cWestern Fire\u201d Women\u2019s Hundred side and the \u201cSouth West and Wales\u201d centre of excellence whereas the men will be based in Cardiff. The email also confirms the ECB, having threatened to withdraw funding from women\u2019s county cricket, will continue to run a women\u2019s county Twenty20 competition next year and 2021. Richard Bedbrook, the coach of Surrey Women and the Surrey Stars KSL team, says the changes are \u201cvery exciting\u201d. He said: \u201cIt will allow players the opportunity of really taking the next steps, from all their cricketing skills to their physical condition to then hopefully bridging the gap with the mental side of it, and allowing them to challenge for the England squad. \u201cIf you keep streamlining the talent pool, you create more competition because the teams are much more evenly balanced. The games are played between the best players at the highest standard and therefore more pressure moments occur.\u201d For the England squad, who spend all their time in a \u201cLoughborough bubble\u201d, the centres will provide a much-needed fresh environment. For domestic players, who have always had to juggle work or study with cricket while receiving no remuneration, the revamp is also welcome. \u201cYou put in so much effort for so many years, and the fact that now you might actually get a chance to be rewarded for your efforts all year round and become that bit more professional is amazing,\u201d said the 24-year-old batter Aylish Cranstone, who plays for Surrey at county level and in the KSL. There remains widespread concern about the replacement of the Super League with the Women\u2019s Hundred. The KSL attracted more than 40,000 fans to matches across the past two seasons, including two sellout Finals Days at Hove. Players such as Kirstie Gordon, Sophia Dunkley and most recently Mady Villiers have made international debuts largely as a result of impressive performances in the Super League. Cranstone feels she has benefitted enormously from \u201cbeing around high-level players \u2013 seeing how they train, how they go about things and how they deal with high-pressure situations\u201d and admits she is concerned about the future. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a few years to get a real fanbase,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Surrey fans and they\u2019ll always be loyal to Surrey but for the other franchises, say Western Storm or Loughborough Lightning, they\u2019ve really gained a fan base that will just come to see them. So it\u2019s upsetting that that\u2019s grown year on year and developed, and that\u2019s now not going to be there any more.\u201d Another area of concern is the lack of information provided to players regarding the amount they can expect to earn and the time commitment required should they win a place at one of the centres. Katie Levick, the Yorkshire Diamonds leg-spinner who juggles cricket with her role as a marketing manager, said: \u201cIt\u2019s causing a few headaches from a work perspective!\u201d One thing is certain. The changes represent the biggest shake-up domestic women\u2019s cricket in England has ever seen. The final season of the KSL looks set to be given added impetus as players seek to make their case for inclusion in the new semi-professional setup.",

      "body": "<p>When Sean Butterfield started door knocking for the re-election campaign of Seattle\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/19/seattle-socialist-city-council-kshama-sawant\">only socialist city council representative</a>, Kshama Sawant, earlier this year, he knew his task was not easy. Last year Sawant took on one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations, Amazon, with a tax intended to fund public housing, and nearly won.</p> <p>Butterfield reasoned that Amazon, along with the rest of Seattle\u2019s formidable business sector, would make its presence felt as the primary election day on 6 August drew closer.</p> <p>So it has happened. Well over a million dollars in political action committee money has poured into Seattle\u2019s local elections, with the city\u2019s Chamber of Commerce Pac alone spending $1.1m (Amazon contributed $250,000), and two other Pacs pouring in another $477,00.</p> <p>Together, the Pacs have spent over $312,000 on Sawant\u2019s race alone, much of it coming in the form of attack mailers.</p> <p>More than a dozen of Amazon\u2019s top executives have also now donated to one of Sawant\u2019s primary opponents, Egan Orion. The list includes Jay Carney, the former press secretary for the Obama administration who is the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/07/washington-revolving-door-lobbying-jobs-obama\"> PR and policy chief for Amazon.</a> Two of Amazon\u2019s three CEOs have donated to Orion as well, with Jeff Bezos being the only one not to have personally chipped in, according to numbers from the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission.</p> <p>Butterfield, a 35-year-old healthcare worker, was surprised at just how effective the money was, even when spent on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Zach_Wurtz/status/1157057680319512576\">campaign mailers</a>. Dozens have hit mailboxes in the district since mid July, and he didn\u2019t grasp their impact until he started seeing \u2013 and hearing \u2013 it as he went from door to door.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just shocking when you go knock on somebody\u2019s door, and it\u2019s just a barrage of these talking points,\u201d Butterfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s not too hard to untie these knots, the arguments these talking points rest on, but you can\u2019t do that with everybody. We can\u2019t knock on every door.\u201d</p> <p>But while the mailers might be effective, the role of business money and Amazon in the race could play well for Sawant, who is facing five other candidates besides Orion, with the top two going on to the general election on 5 November.</p> <p>\u201cThis race and indeed all of the city\u2019s elections this year will be a referendum on one fundamental question: who gets to run Seattle? Big business like Amazon and real estate corporations, or working people?\u201d Sawant told the Guardian.</p> <p>A 46-year-old former tech worker who left the field to obtain a PhD in economics and enter grassroots organizing, Sawant has built her political career on championing social movements and taking on big business. Her message has resonated in Seattle, a city with one of the<a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-ranks-near-top-for-gentrification-but-that-might-not-be-as-bad-as-you-think-study-finds/\"> highest rates </a>of gentrification in the country, and where residents have become increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/04/is-bezos-holding-seattle-hostage-the-cost-of-being-amazons-home\">skeptical</a> of the influence of Amazon and its large downtown campus.</p> <p>Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative party, drew national attention in 2015 as<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/05/seattle-minimum-wage-socialist-councillor-class-warfare\"> one of the driving forces</a> that led Seattle to become the first major city to adopt a $15 minimum wage, and again was in the spotlight in 2018 as she pushed for the so-called \u201cAmazon tax\u201d.</p> <p>The proposal would have levied a $275-per-employee \u201chead tax\u201d on corporations making over $20m a year to fund new public housing and homeless services. Seattle has the<a href=\"https://komonews.com/news/local/report-seattle-has-nations-largest-homeless-population-outside-of-new-york-los-angeles\"> third-highest homeless population</a> in the US, behind only New York and LA.</p> <p>The tax initially passed, but was repealed only a month later after Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/15/amazon-threatens-to-move-jobs-out-of-seattle-tax-council-vote-homelessness\">threatened to move jobs out of the city </a>and teamed up with labor unions, who were afraid of job losses, in a campaign that attacked the plan as a job-killer that could drive the city\u2019s largest private employer out of town.</p> <p>The differences between Sawant and Orion, both ideological and strategic, are telling in that they echo conflicts occurring between progressives across the country. While the two agree on the problems facing the city, like homelessness and affordable housing, they offer radically different ways of solving them.</p> <p>Sawant\u2019s uncompromising style of confrontational, movement-driven politics has made her enemies \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/06/21/40537570/weird-crony-careerism-why-the-labor-council-rejected-kshama-sawant\">some in labor</a> \u2013 and critics often accuse her of being divisive. Orion, an entrepreneur known for saving the city\u2019s pride festival, PrideFest, says he represents a different approach.</p> <p>As the executive director of a neighborhood chamber of commerce, he accepts that business is backing his campaign. He criticizes Sawant for receiving a substantial amount of individual donations from <a href=\"https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/06/12/40456394/where-is-kshama-sawants-campaign-money-coming-from-her-competition-wants-to-know\">people outside the state</a> \u2013 and she\u2019s raised more money than other candidates, reflecting the fact that she\u2019s an incumbent with a national profile. For his part, Orion sees the support he gets from business as a sign of the effectiveness of his less confrontational, more partnership-driven model of politics.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKshama Sawant is the worst partner for our large businesses. You know, a bologna sandwich would be a better partner,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>On homelessness, Orion argues the city doesn\u2019t need more tax revenue from business but instead should focus on \u201cgetting better outcomes\u201d, with the funds currently being distributed to non-profits who work with the homeless population.</p> <p>The two also differ on how the city should create more affordable housing. Orion <a href=\"https://www.eganforseattle.org/housing/\">favors</a> increasing urban density and cutting regulations to encourage developers to build more housing, arguing that would increase housing supply, and therefore lower prices.</p> <p>Sawant advocates for rent control, an idea, that despite its many <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-does-economic-evidence-tell-us-about-the-effects-of-rent-control/\">critics</a> in academia, is resurfacing as a<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/07/18/europe-embraces-rent-controls-a-policy-that-never-works\"> force in Europe</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/17/742875001/new-york-landlords-call-rent-control-laws-an-illegal-taking-in-new-federal-lawsu\">some traction</a> in the US as well. Like the yimbys, she supports density and upzoning, but thinks the government and not the private sector should be doing most of the building, saying that purely market-based solutions are \u201cnaive at best\u201d.</p> <p>For Rich Smith, a reporter covering the race for Seattle\u2019s alternative weekly, the Stranger, a Sawant v Orion matchup, if it happens in the general election, would reflect a larger clash happening in the city between more well-off residents who identify as progressive on cultural issues like gay marriage or immigration, but are more moderate on economic issues like taxes or housing, and younger, working-class voters who are generally more willing to embrace the ideas of socialist candidates like Sawant.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a whole contingent of people in Seattle who typically have money, who are Democrats or consider themselves progressive, and think that Seattle is the most progressive place on the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so they don\u2019t like it when people point out that there\u2019s huge issues, at least structurally in terms of homelessness, transit, economic inequality, housing or other crises that we\u2019re facing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Butterfield, the Sawant campaign volunteer, thinks her direct style makes existing conflicts more visible, and he welcomes it.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why people call her divisive and claim that she won\u2019t bring everyone to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cAs though Amazon doesn\u2019t have a voice in Seattle politics, it\u2019s preposterous, right? I mean, they own the damn table.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Sean Butterfield started door knocking for the re-election campaign of Seattle\u2019s only socialist city council representative, Kshama Sawant, earlier this year, he knew his task was not easy. Last year Sawant took on one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations, Amazon, with a tax intended to fund public housing, and nearly won. Butterfield reasoned that Amazon, along with the rest of Seattle\u2019s formidable business sector, would make its presence felt as the primary election day on 6 August drew closer. So it has happened. Well over a million dollars in political action committee money has poured into Seattle\u2019s local elections, with the city\u2019s Chamber of Commerce Pac alone spending $1.1m (Amazon contributed $250,000), and two other Pacs pouring in another $477,00. Together, the Pacs have spent over $312,000 on Sawant\u2019s race alone, much of it coming in the form of attack mailers. More than a dozen of Amazon\u2019s top executives have also now donated to one of Sawant\u2019s primary opponents, Egan Orion. The list includes Jay Carney, the former press secretary for the Obama administration who is the PR and policy chief for Amazon. Two of Amazon\u2019s three CEOs have donated to Orion as well, with Jeff Bezos being the only one not to have personally chipped in, according to numbers from the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission. Butterfield, a 35-year-old healthcare worker, was surprised at just how effective the money was, even when spent on campaign mailers. Dozens have hit mailboxes in the district since mid July, and he didn\u2019t grasp their impact until he started seeing \u2013 and hearing \u2013 it as he went from door to door. \u201cIt\u2019s just shocking when you go knock on somebody\u2019s door, and it\u2019s just a barrage of these talking points,\u201d Butterfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s not too hard to untie these knots, the arguments these talking points rest on, but you can\u2019t do that with everybody. We can\u2019t knock on every door.\u201d But while the mailers might be effective, the role of business money and Amazon in the race could play well for Sawant, who is facing five other candidates besides Orion, with the top two going on to the general election on 5 November. \u201cThis race and indeed all of the city\u2019s elections this year will be a referendum on one fundamental question: who gets to run Seattle? Big business like Amazon and real estate corporations, or working people?\u201d Sawant told the Guardian. A 46-year-old former tech worker who left the field to obtain a PhD in economics and enter grassroots organizing, Sawant has built her political career on championing social movements and taking on big business. Her message has resonated in Seattle, a city with one of the highest rates of gentrification in the country, and where residents have become increasingly skeptical of the influence of Amazon and its large downtown campus. Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative party, drew national attention in 2015 as one of the driving forces that led Seattle to become the first major city to adopt a $15 minimum wage, and again was in the spotlight in 2018 as she pushed for the so-called \u201cAmazon tax\u201d. The proposal would have levied a $275-per-employee \u201chead tax\u201d on corporations making over $20m a year to fund new public housing and homeless services. Seattle has the third-highest homeless population in the US, behind only New York and LA. The tax initially passed, but was repealed only a month later after Amazon threatened to move jobs out of the city and teamed up with labor unions, who were afraid of job losses, in a campaign that attacked the plan as a job-killer that could drive the city\u2019s largest private employer out of town. The differences between Sawant and Orion, both ideological and strategic, are telling in that they echo conflicts occurring between progressives across the country. While the two agree on the problems facing the city, like homelessness and affordable housing, they offer radically different ways of solving them. Sawant\u2019s uncompromising style of confrontational, movement-driven politics has made her enemies \u2013 including some in labor \u2013 and critics often accuse her of being divisive. Orion, an entrepreneur known for saving the city\u2019s pride festival, PrideFest, says he represents a different approach. As the executive director of a neighborhood chamber of commerce, he accepts that business is backing his campaign. He criticizes Sawant for receiving a substantial amount of individual donations from people outside the state \u2013 and she\u2019s raised more money than other candidates, reflecting the fact that she\u2019s an incumbent with a national profile. For his part, Orion sees the support he gets from business as a sign of the effectiveness of his less confrontational, more partnership-driven model of politics.\u201d \u201cKshama Sawant is the worst partner for our large businesses. You know, a bologna sandwich would be a better partner,\u201d he told the Guardian. On homelessness, Orion argues the city doesn\u2019t need more tax revenue from business but instead should focus on \u201cgetting better outcomes\u201d, with the funds currently being distributed to non-profits who work with the homeless population. The two also differ on how the city should create more affordable housing. Orion favors increasing urban density and cutting regulations to encourage developers to build more housing, arguing that would increase housing supply, and therefore lower prices. Sawant advocates for rent control, an idea, that despite its many critics in academia, is resurfacing as a force in Europe, with some traction in the US as well. Like the yimbys, she supports density and upzoning, but thinks the government and not the private sector should be doing most of the building, saying that purely market-based solutions are \u201cnaive at best\u201d. For Rich Smith, a reporter covering the race for Seattle\u2019s alternative weekly, the Stranger, a Sawant v Orion matchup, if it happens in the general election, would reflect a larger clash happening in the city between more well-off residents who identify as progressive on cultural issues like gay marriage or immigration, but are more moderate on economic issues like taxes or housing, and younger, working-class voters who are generally more willing to embrace the ideas of socialist candidates like Sawant. \u201cThere is a whole contingent of people in Seattle who typically have money, who are Democrats or consider themselves progressive, and think that Seattle is the most progressive place on the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so they don\u2019t like it when people point out that there\u2019s huge issues, at least structurally in terms of homelessness, transit, economic inequality, housing or other crises that we\u2019re facing,\u201d he said. Butterfield, the Sawant campaign volunteer, thinks her direct style makes existing conflicts more visible, and he welcomes it. \u201cThat\u2019s why people call her divisive and claim that she won\u2019t bring everyone to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cAs though Amazon doesn\u2019t have a voice in Seattle politics, it\u2019s preposterous, right? I mean, they own the damn table.\u201d",

The company\u2019s Norwegian owner, Dolphin Drilling, filed for bankruptcy in June and put the Belfast shipyard up for sale.</p> <p>The company\u2019s yellow cranes \u2013 named Samson and Goliath \u2013 have dominated Belfast\u2019s skyline since 1974, but the workforce at the yard has declined from a peak of more than 35,000 in the 1920s to only 130 as Northern Ireland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/06/uk-shipbuilding-industry-bae-portsmouth\">shipbuilding industry has all but disappeared</a>.

The yard also played a key role in the second world war, producing warships such as <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090106052311/http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.125\">HMS Belfast</a>, the cruiser now moored on London\u2019s South Bank as a floating museum.</p> <p>The yard built its last ocean liner, the Canberra, in 1961, to take passengers from the UK to Australia. But Harland and Wolff gradually declined as the age of mass air travel supplanted travel by ship, and shipyards in east Asia offered cheaper vessels.</p> <p>The yard has recently focused on repair work on ships and oil rigs and manufacturing the vast steel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/25/harland-and-wolff-wins-east-anglia-one-offshore-windfarm-contract\">\u201cfoundation jackets\u201d</a> used on offshore wind turbines.

He claimed Boris Johnson had failed the shipyard workers in his first real test as prime minister.</p> <p>\u201cWe know this is a viable concern, we know the government has naval contracts it can put here to ensure the long-term future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know there are contracts out there but it just needs support from the government.</p> <p>\u201cI am saying to Boris Johnson very specifically he can\u2019t stand on the sidelines.\u201d</p> <p>The bill for full nationalisation would reach millions of pounds, but a source with knowledge of the business said aid of only about \u00a3600,000 could have been enough to sustain the shipyard until the final quarter of the year, when it had hoped to win new orders. However, any such move could be viewed as illegal state aid under EU rules.</p> <p>Potential new orders included a contract to develop the Ministry of Defence\u2019s new Type 31e frigate \u2013 for which Harland and Wolff was part of a consortium bidding for the work \u2013 as well as multiple renewable energy contracts. The company was due to sign a contract understood to be worth as much as \u00a380m on 12 August with the oil firm Suncor for upgrades to a floating oil storage vessel, the Terra Nova.</p> <p>However, the government said last week the shipyard\u2019s fate was \u201cultimately a commercial issue\u201d. The uncertainty over the company\u2019s future is thought to have hindered its ability to win new orders in recent weeks.</p> <p>MJM Group, a Newry-based company specialising in boat fit-outs, and Flacks Group, a US buyer of struggling firms, have expressed their interest in buying the stricken business.</p> <p>A person close to the talks said MJM appeared to be the frontrunner. MJM submitted a bid that was withdrawn a fortnight ago, prompting Unite to describe the firm as a \u201cbrand stripper\u201d that would allow jobs to be lost while taking on the iconic name.</p> <p>Workers at the site were scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon to discuss their options. They have occupied the yard in protest, and demonstrated outside Stormont during a visit by the new prime minister. The parliamentary majority of Boris Johnson\u2019s government is reliant on the support of the Democratic Unionist party, whose MP Gavin Robinson represents the Belfast East constituency containing the yard.</p> <p>Susan Fitzgerald, a regional coordinating officer at Unite, said employees had been treated as \u201clittle more than collateral damage to be cleared out\u201d.</p> <p>She added that the site contained many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jul/24/museums-join-forces-to-bring-titanic-relics-to-the-uk\">items of historic value</a>, such as antique chairs, crystal glassware and pewter boxes used on the ships. Those artefacts belonged to the people of Belfast but could be lost in any sale, she said.</p> <p>The decline of Harland and Wolff comes at a time when the entire Northern Irish economy \u2013 including a large manufacturing sector \u2013 faces an existential threat in a no-deal Brexit, according to Stephen Kelly, the chief executive of Manufacturing NI, a lobby group for the sector.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kelly described Harland and Wolff\u2019s fate as a \u201cfailure of politics\u201d in both Westminster and Stormont, where there has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/26/northern-ireland-power-sharing-stormont-crisis-timeline\">no functioning elected government</a> for more than two and a half years.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has been either unable or unwilling to step in to see this firm through,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the iconic nature of the shipyard we can be pretty confident that, had there been a Northern Irish government in place, they would have been in a position to help.\u201d</p> <p>MJM has been contacted but has so far refused to comment on its intentions.

      "bodyText": "The historic Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic is expected to collapse into administration on Monday, threatening the end of centuries of shipbuilding in the city. Harland and Wolff Heavy Industries, which dates back to 1861, has struggled in recent years as a result of stiff competition from overseas rivals. The company\u2019s Norwegian owner, Dolphin Drilling, filed for bankruptcy in June and put the Belfast shipyard up for sale. The company\u2019s yellow cranes \u2013 named Samson and Goliath \u2013 have dominated Belfast\u2019s skyline since 1974, but the workforce at the yard has declined from a peak of more than 35,000 in the 1920s to only 130 as Northern Ireland\u2019s shipbuilding industry has all but disappeared. The remaining staff have been given redundancy notices. As well as the \u201cunsinkable\u201d Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912, the shipyard on the banks of the River Lagan made some of the world\u2019s largest and most famous ships, such as the Titanic\u2019s fleet mates, the Olympic and Britannic liners. The yard also played a key role in the second world war, producing warships such as HMS Belfast, the cruiser now moored on London\u2019s South Bank as a floating museum. The yard built its last ocean liner, the Canberra, in 1961, to take passengers from the UK to Australia. But Harland and Wolff gradually declined as the age of mass air travel supplanted travel by ship, and shipyards in east Asia offered cheaper vessels. The yard has recently focused on repair work on ships and oil rigs and manufacturing the vast steel \u201cfoundation jackets\u201d used on offshore wind turbines. However, in 2016 \u2013 the last year for which it has filed accounts \u2013 it slumped to a loss of \u00a35.8m, compared with a \u00a31.1m profit in 2015. Over the same one-year period the company\u2019s turnover crashed from \u00a367m to just over \u00a38m. A spokesman for Harland and Wolff said: \u201cThere has been a series of board meetings, the result of which is that administrators will be appointed.\u201d The accountancy firm BDO has been lined up to take over the business on Tuesday. The Labour party and the Unite union called for the shipyard to be nationalised, a move they claim would save the government money in lost tax revenues. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, addressed Harland and Wolff workers at the site on Monday. He claimed Boris Johnson had failed the shipyard workers in his first real test as prime minister. \u201cWe know this is a viable concern, we know the government has naval contracts it can put here to ensure the long-term future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know there are contracts out there but it just needs support from the government. \u201cI am saying to Boris Johnson very specifically he can\u2019t stand on the sidelines.\u201d The bill for full nationalisation would reach millions of pounds, but a source with knowledge of the business said aid of only about \u00a3600,000 could have been enough to sustain the shipyard until the final quarter of the year, when it had hoped to win new orders. However, any such move could be viewed as illegal state aid under EU rules. Potential new orders included a contract to develop the Ministry of Defence\u2019s new Type 31e frigate \u2013 for which Harland and Wolff was part of a consortium bidding for the work \u2013 as well as multiple renewable energy contracts. The company was due to sign a contract understood to be worth as much as \u00a380m on 12 August with the oil firm Suncor for upgrades to a floating oil storage vessel, the Terra Nova. However, the government said last week the shipyard\u2019s fate was \u201cultimately a commercial issue\u201d. The uncertainty over the company\u2019s future is thought to have hindered its ability to win new orders in recent weeks. MJM Group, a Newry-based company specialising in boat fit-outs, and Flacks Group, a US buyer of struggling firms, have expressed their interest in buying the stricken business. A person close to the talks said MJM appeared to be the frontrunner. MJM submitted a bid that was withdrawn a fortnight ago, prompting Unite to describe the firm as a \u201cbrand stripper\u201d that would allow jobs to be lost while taking on the iconic name. Workers at the site were scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon to discuss their options. They have occupied the yard in protest, and demonstrated outside Stormont during a visit by the new prime minister. The parliamentary majority of Boris Johnson\u2019s government is reliant on the support of the Democratic Unionist party, whose MP Gavin Robinson represents the Belfast East constituency containing the yard. Susan Fitzgerald, a regional coordinating officer at Unite, said employees had been treated as \u201clittle more than collateral damage to be cleared out\u201d. She added that the site contained many items of historic value, such as antique chairs, crystal glassware and pewter boxes used on the ships. Those artefacts belonged to the people of Belfast but could be lost in any sale, she said. The decline of Harland and Wolff comes at a time when the entire Northern Irish economy \u2013 including a large manufacturing sector \u2013 faces an existential threat in a no-deal Brexit, according to Stephen Kelly, the chief executive of Manufacturing NI, a lobby group for the sector. Kelly described Harland and Wolff\u2019s fate as a \u201cfailure of politics\u201d in both Westminster and Stormont, where there has been no functioning elected government for more than two and a half years. \u201cThe government has been either unable or unwilling to step in to see this firm through,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the iconic nature of the shipyard we can be pretty confident that, had there been a Northern Irish government in place, they would have been in a position to help.\u201d MJM has been contacted but has so far refused to comment on its intentions. Flacks Group declined to comment.",

By the time of the show\u2019s airing, it was widely reported that the shooter in El Paso, a 21-year-old white man, had published an anti-immigrant screed online before opening fire at a Walmart on Saturday, killing 20.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/aug/05/trump-news-today-el-paso-shooting-ohio-media-politics-latest\">Trump blames 'violent' video games and the internet after mass shootings \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shooting that targeted a prominent, multicultural city along the Mexican border \u2013 a place frequently invoked in the president\u2019s comments condemning Hispanic immigrants \u2013 demanded, for Oliver, an examination of racism filtering from the top of American government into mass violence. \u201cClearly, white nationalism and anti-immigrant hysteria did not start with this president,\u201d Oliver said of Donald Trump. But the president \u201ccertainly seems to have created an environment where those kind of views can fester and indeed thrive\u201d.</p> <p>To illustrate the point, Oliver drew up a clip from one of Trump\u2019s recent rallies in northern Florida, in which he whipped up the crowd by claiming that 15,000 migrants were marching to the southern border and asked: \u201cHow do you stop these people?\u201d When someone from the crowd shouted back \u201cshoot them!\u201d Trump laughed, shook his head and said: \u201cThat\u2019s only in the [Florida] Panhandle you can get away with that stuff.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG5k4tDaHUk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OG5k4tDaHUk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The clip is remarkable for several reasons, most prominently, according to Oliver, in that \u201cit is not \u2018only in the Panhandle\u2019 where you can get away with that statement. You can now get away with it all over the country and, as he just made painfully clear, any room the actual president is in.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver described Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cabsolutely appalling\u201d, and warned that his callousness \u201cis something we cannot afford to get numb to,\u201d because if Trump\u2019s \u201conly in the panhandle\u201d clip \u201cever, for even a moment, feels like it\u2019s become normal, we are completely fucked\u201d.</p> <p>Oliver concluded with a few words of comfort. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to learn more about this story in the weeks and months ahead, and there may be time to talk about it more in depth then.\u201d But in the meantime, \u201cplease, after a tough, tough day, please enjoy this nonsense,\u201d he said, before launching into the show\u2019s intro and a segment on prison labor.</p>",

By the time of the show\u2019s airing, it was widely reported that the shooter in El Paso, a 21-year-old white man, had published an anti-immigrant screed online before opening fire at a Walmart on Saturday, killing 20. The shooting that targeted a prominent, multicultural city along the Mexican border \u2013 a place frequently invoked in the president\u2019s comments condemning Hispanic immigrants \u2013 demanded, for Oliver, an examination of racism filtering from the top of American government into mass violence. \u201cClearly, white nationalism and anti-immigrant hysteria did not start with this president,\u201d Oliver said of Donald Trump. But the president \u201ccertainly seems to have created an environment where those kind of views can fester and indeed thrive\u201d. To illustrate the point, Oliver drew up a clip from one of Trump\u2019s recent rallies in northern Florida, in which he whipped up the crowd by claiming that 15,000 migrants were marching to the southern border and asked: \u201cHow do you stop these people?\u201d When someone from the crowd shouted back \u201cshoot them!\u201d Trump laughed, shook his head and said: \u201cThat\u2019s only in the [Florida] Panhandle you can get away with that stuff.\u201d The clip is remarkable for several reasons, most prominently, according to Oliver, in that \u201cit is not \u2018only in the Panhandle\u2019 where you can get away with that statement. You can now get away with it all over the country and, as he just made painfully clear, any room the actual president is in.\u201d Oliver described Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cabsolutely appalling\u201d, and warned that his callousness \u201cis something we cannot afford to get numb to,\u201d because if Trump\u2019s \u201conly in the panhandle\u201d clip \u201cever, for even a moment, feels like it\u2019s become normal, we are completely fucked\u201d. Oliver concluded with a few words of comfort. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to learn more about this story in the weeks and months ahead, and there may be time to talk about it more in depth then.\u201d But in the meantime, \u201cplease, after a tough, tough day, please enjoy this nonsense,\u201d he said, before launching into the show\u2019s intro and a segment on prison labor.",

After the first few hours I thought we were excellent. We\u2019re running out of things to say about Smithy: he\u2019s probably the best Test batsman I\u2019ve ever seen. Wadey has been in red-hot form in the last 18 months and I think he\u2019s been picked at the right time.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNathan rarely lets us down. It\u2019s always hard coming to the ground on day five when there\u2019s pressure on you to win the game. Nathan bowled superbly today but I thought our quicks were outstanding and took a lot of pressure off him. They were sensational this morning.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI said before the game that it didn\u2019t matter where the first Test was played \u2013 we know the crowd will be against us wherever we play in England, and it\u2019ll be bloody hard work to win.

I thought we played some really good cricket for the majority of the Test match, but credit to Australia; they fought hard to get back in it and bowled extremely well today. Two brilliant innings from Steve, we\u2019ll have to keep working hard at trying him out. It was hard losing Jimmy early on but these things happen and you have to take it on the chin. It was a group decision to select Jimmy \u2013 he passed all the fitness tests and it\u2019s just one of those freak things that can happen. We\u2019re not sure about Jimmy and Jofra for Lord\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll have to see how they shape up.

There was some high-class bowling, and I think we have to look further back in the Test to see where we could have done better. <em>[Any World Cup fatigue?]</em> Nah, I think that\u2019s a bit of an excuse.

All that feared Hollies Stand booing, sledging and general disobligingness <em>really</em> worked. Smith was deeply affected. He blew that 2nd inns 150 like an 8 year old girl with confidence issues. Talk about mental disintegration. Fans at other grounds should follow suit and chivy him into an early grave (or a thousand runs in the series). Same thing happened to Shane Warne in 2005, I seem to remember. It is <em>always</em> a good idea to give Australians the general Bronx cheer. They\u2019re a very undefiant bunch.\u201d</p> \n  <p>I wonder what will happen at Lord\u2019s next week? It can get a bit loose in the Compton and Edrich Stands these days. Then again, when Amir made his comeback in 2016, the booing lasted three overs.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAll I remember of the last session at Cardiff was that I found a screen in a pub to watch it on\u201d emails Geoff Wignall. \u201cI can\u2019t recall the name of the pub nor even which town/city it was in but I do remember the cricket. And that whichever pub it was sold Timothy Taylor\u2019s Landlord.\u201d What an odd thing memory is.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWith regards to the lbw shout against Root in Lyon\u2019s previous over, the \u201cbat-behind-the-pad\u201d technique needs dealing with by general umpiring consensus, if not a definitive rule of some sort,\u201d says Adam Giles. \u201cI would add, however, that the umpires have done well with consistency in such a regard in this match, seeing as a certain Mr. Wade is a rather experienced proponent of such a tactic.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Like so many things in cricket, you have to know it when you see it. I don\u2019t know if there is a way of policing in any formal way, is there?</p> \n  <p>Gareth Frith reports that he is watching the Lancs 2nd XI play Oman today. Is Glenn Maxwell playing? What about Haseeb? Or Parko?</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Australia declare 8 or 10 overs earlier leave England more of a possible-but-not-really-gettable total to tempt them and give themselves more time to get the 10 wickets?\u201d asks Stephen Brown. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like rocket science.\u201d</p> \n  <p>My guess is that they didn\u2019t want to give England anything even remotely chaseable - drive them into the ground, and so on. The reality is, on a fifth day track, they alwas had time to get this done.</p> \n  <p>\u201cJust wondering when you\u2019re due to switch with Rob?\u201d asks Richard Jansz-Moore. \u201cNeed to know whether England can survive long enough for Rob to get into the hot seat to provide the necessary despair to describe England\u2019s failure. Or whether you will be lucky enough to write about the glory of Australia\u2019s triumph?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Drinks in this session. So, it <em>should</em> be Rob.

Welcome to our sport\u2019s dysfunctional family. </p> \n  <p>\u201cMore Cardiff 2009 love / hate,\u201d says Jack Jorgensen. \u201cI was on my then girlfriend\u2019s (now wife\u2019s) family farm 3 hours east of Perth. ABC feed of the TMS coverage and, I think, Channel 9 coverage on the TV. I egregiously went to bed thinking we had it in the bag. What a disappointment to wake up to a draw, but what admiration for Panesar and Anderson. Hopeful, albeit not entirely sure of, a different outcome today.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It\u2019ll be worth staying up for tonight. Always worth it. It\u2019s something I miss about living in Australia: late night Tests from England.</p> \n  <p>\u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi Suzy McAnanama-Brereton. \u201cI was in New York when my boyfriend at the time (now my husband) introduced me to cricket through the Guardian OBO. Being an American who only knew cricket as that weird game that kept putting brown patches in the middle of my soccer field, it was difficult to follow by just reading. Regardless, I had the utmost respect for Collingwood batting for almost 6 hours, and then when all hope seemed lost, Jimmy and Monty batting until the close of play. Because of the 2009 Ashes I\u2019m an England fan for life.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Yes! The OBO, as we learned on day one when hundreds (and hundreds) of people told me where in the world they were reading in from, really does bring people together from around the world.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIs this a record for number of decisions overturned in a single test?\u201d asks Matthew Valentine. This is it. I don\u2019t know what the record was before, but I\u2019m sure Andrew Samson noted that we went beyond it at some stage yesterday. Poor old Joel Wilson. Was only promoted to the elite panel a couple of months ago and everything. <br></p> \n  <p>On that same topic from Mike Daniels: \u201cIn fairness to Wilson, inside edges are very difficult to see/hear. The bowler doesn\u2019t necessarily pick it up either. That\u2019s not a bad decision - those inside edges have been given throughout cricketing history. It\u2019s not new and is no evidence of umpires being worse today. It\u2019s only that we\u2019ve now got the technology that can turn back time and allow for a second (or third) look - a facility that was denied umpires in the past.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Yep, I\u2019m more sympathetic than most as well. Where he\u2019s really let himself down are the leg before decisions: Wade and Root. Both fairly obviously not out when watching in real time. He\u2019s frazzled.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cBilal Shafayat is inside the stumps,\u201d lols Eamonn Maloney, \u201cwith a fresh pair of gloves.\u201d It\u2019s time for a Where Are They Now on him.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d481b878f08c7e177d44edc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-05T12:06:58.040Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Four wickets across the session. </strong>Australia\u2019s morning, without doubt.

This was what I referenced in the preamble before play- Lyon, 24 hours ago, shadow-batting as a left-hander, working out where he would target. Stokes doesn\u2019t take any bait here though, watching and leaving. One takes off that ends up with slip, but he\u2019s through to the finish line. Well, this finish line, anyway. Four hours (65 overs) to go. For England to be any chance now, their vice-captain will need to face a great many of them. He can think about that at <strong>LUNCH! </strong><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d4819f68f08c7e177d44ecb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-05T12:01:35.287Z\">1.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>31st over: England 85-4 (Buttler 1, Stokes 0)</strong> Cummins mixes up his lengths to Cummins in what could be the final over before lunch.

Bancroft will be under some pressure to keep his spot for Lord\u2019s (correctly or otherwise), but catches like that help an awful lot. Stokes does his job well, the in-form man comfortably defending the rest of Lyon\u2019s set. \u201cSir Richard Hadlee, Sir Ben Stokes\u201d says Tim Paine through the stump mic. I guess that works?

You hear a bit, but not heaps. Today, though, with the ground about a third full, we can hear <em>everything</em>. Needless to say, Matt Wade is just as loud at mid-off as he was when wicketkeeping. This should be fun. Pattinson to Roy, who is more than happy leaving the first few alone as both players find their range. Directing straighter, the opener has to keep out a full ball right on the money and is then struck on the pad, but it is going well down the legside from my vantage point. No review. Roy gets his first run for the day behind square, Burns seeing out the rest. I saw some crazy stuff on twitter overnight suggesting that Roy should have a pop at 398 and all the rest. That\u2019s not how this works. <strong><br></strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d47fe528f08c7e177d44d80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-05T10:06:07.865Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>8th over: England 17-0 (Burns 11, Roy 6)</strong> What a lovely way to start for Burns, getting onto his front foot and driving Cummins down the ground for four!

Automatic alerts will presumably only be bearers of bad news, whereas the optimist in me can remain undisturbed so long as I leave my phone alone.

It\u2019s become hackneyed, and I\u2019d like to put in a good word for some of the fine alternatives available to us, such as crumple, disintegrate, cave in, slump or subside. Fine words all of them, and they deserve their time in the sun, or even in warm but slightly overcast and weather.\u201d</p> \n  <p>When writing on collapses, there\u2019s a lot of *right click/synonym* going on, which means I give all of these a run.

Of course. I was at Cardiff for Ponting\u2019s 150 but watched a lot of rain.<br></p> \n  <p>By the Sunday, I was in a little village called Baston in Lincolnshire where I had spent a couple of months during the 2005 Ashes bashing around playing cricket and being your stock-standard 20-year-old Australian backpacker. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/collinsadam/status/1147976916697268224?s=20\">Evidence of that</a>. Anyway, four years on I was back. Was Greg Norman not close to winning the Open that day too, falling just short? That\u2019s how I like to remember it. It was hot. <br></p> \n  <p>But nobody at the Spinning Wheel boozer had Sky. So we crowded around a TV and listened to the TMS call that way. Peter Siddle giving his all; Mitch Johnson not quite dependable enough - despite having had a very good match, it is so often forgotten. Nathan Hauritz so unlucky. Ben Hilfenhaus underbowled. Marcus North! </p> \n  <p>There is a scene in Barney Douglas\u2019 new film <em>The Edge</em> that documents that final hour at Cardiff is so incredibly well, thanks in large part due to Felix White\u2019s score. <a href=\"https://finalwordcricket.com/2019/07/26/7-the-final-word-with-felix-white-barney-douglas/\">We discussed this with them at length</a> in an interview from Geoff and my pod the other week.

At both ends, he surveyed the rough on offer. Instructively, he then lined himself up to shadow-bat as a left-hander, doubtless signalling to the southpaws in the home dressing room that he would be coming from them in the fourth innings of this match. </p> \n  <p>The off-spinner isn\u2019t today\u2019s only actor, but he will play the most important role. Nowadays, he bowls with confidence in the final stanza - with numbers to match. If England have to survive 540 deliveries, about 250 will be from Australia\u2019s most accomplished finger-spinner of all time. That\u2019s some degree of difficulty.</p> \n  <p>I can report that from my desk that it is a stunning morning with barely a cloud over over Birmingham. If the hosts are going to manage this, and pull off something Cardiff-esque, they won\u2019t be helped by missing a couple of hours due to rain. Could Jimmy feature again, as it did ten years? I\u2019ll let that thought sit with you. </p> \n  <p>Welcome to day five at Edgbaston. Sure, instead of the four results on the table we had yesterday that is now wound back to two thanks to the heroics of Smith and co. But provided the home side can dig in across the first session, this promises to be fascinating all the same.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/collinsadam/status/1158301298464350213\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Day five. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ashes?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Ashes</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NUMx004trw\">pic.twitter.com/NUMx004trw</a></p>\u2014 Adam Collins (@collinsadam) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/collinsadam/status/1158301298464350213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 5, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div>",

Congratulations to Australia, who did an emphatic number on England - and at Edgbaston as well. See you at Lord\u2019s! \u201cIsn\u2019t that going a bit far?\u201d says Stuart MacKenzie. \u201cI could be a lot more chuffed for him if he hadn\u2018t been banned for cheating, and I would be a lot more chuffed if all the critical runs had been scored by someone like Tim Paine who wasn\u2019t banned for cheating but had to deal with the fallout from those who were.\u201d That\u2019s why I\u2019m so chuffed for him, because he suffered the kind of public shaming that would destroy most of us. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cWell, yeah, well done Australia and Smith and that, but it wasn\u2019t exactly a World Cup semi-final, was it?\u201d Nathan Lyon and Matthew Wade are paying tribute to Steve Smith on Sky Sports Lyon \u201cHe\u2019s unique, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s the best batter in the game. He trains the house down, so we\u2019re not surprised at how good he is because we see the work he does away from the cameras.\u201d Wade \u201cHe puts a brave face on. I don\u2019t think anyone knows the emotions he goes through at times \u2013 I had no idea he was thinking about giving the game away. He just gets in game mode; he hit a lot of balls in the nets before this game. He got in his own little world and away he went.\u201d \u201cSteve Smith\u2019s father,\u201d says Don E, \u201cmust be so proud.\u201d Indeed. I hope his eyes and throat are moist right now. \u201cI don\u2019t know which commentator noted that Steve Smith should not be excused for \u2018such errant\u2019 misfielding ...\u201d says Maurie Cropper. \u201cSounds like a looser sucking sour grapes.\u201d Steve Smith is the Player of the Match, and of his generation Even an England fan, I couldn\u2019t be more chuffed for him. He\u2019s an extremely good human being, and a genius of a cricketer. \u201cYeah, pretty special. I love playing cricket here in England \u2013 the atmosphere is always amazing \u2013 and the boys turned up and played a really good game of cricket. Gazza [Nathan Lyon] did his thing beautifully today and it\u2019s a big boost to go 1-0 up in the series. \u201cI\u2019m just really grateful to be back playing for Australia, doing what I love and contributing to great wins like this. It\u2019s been a pretty special comeback. The first hundred was pretty emotional. I had to take a few deep breaths, take it in and realised what I\u2019d just done. It was almost as special as my first hundred for Australia. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s sunk in yet. It\u2019s been a helluva week \u2013 a helluva six weeks, really \u2013 and playing in the Ashes is the ultimate challenge for an Australian or English cricketer. Hopefully I can keep contributing. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long 18 months, and my friends and family helped me get through some pretty difficult tuimes. I\u2019m really thankful for that.\u201d And here\u2019s Tim Paine \u201cWe were certainly up against it on day one, but when you\u2019ve got the best player in the world, anything\u2019s possible. After the first few hours I thought we were excellent. We\u2019re running out of things to say about Smithy: he\u2019s probably the best Test batsman I\u2019ve ever seen. Wadey has been in red-hot form in the last 18 months and I think he\u2019s been picked at the right time. \u201cNathan rarely lets us down. It\u2019s always hard coming to the ground on day five when there\u2019s pressure on you to win the game. Nathan bowled superbly today but I thought our quicks were outstanding and took a lot of pressure off him. They were sensational this morning. \u201cI said before the game that it didn\u2019t matter where the first Test was played \u2013 we know the crowd will be against us wherever we play in England, and it\u2019ll be bloody hard work to win. I thought the guys handled themselves really well. We stuck to our guns and we\u2019ve come out on top. There\u2019s a long series ahead.\u201d Here\u2019s Joe Root \u201cIt\u2019s bitterly disappointing. I thought we played some really good cricket for the majority of the Test match, but credit to Australia; they fought hard to get back in it and bowled extremely well today. Two brilliant innings from Steve, we\u2019ll have to keep working hard at trying him out. It was hard losing Jimmy early on but these things happen and you have to take it on the chin. It was a group decision to select Jimmy \u2013 he passed all the fitness tests and it\u2019s just one of those freak things that can happen. We\u2019re not sure about Jimmy and Jofra for Lord\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll have to see how they shape up. We\u2019ve got plenty of time before the Lord\u2019s Test and I think it\u2019s important we\u2019re clear on how we want to go. \u201cI think we were bowled out today, if I\u2019m being brutally honest. There was some high-class bowling, and I think we have to look further back in the Test to see where we could have done better. [Any World Cup fatigue?] Nah, I think that\u2019s a bit of an excuse. We played some good stuff throughout the game; we just didn\u2019t do it for long enough periods. We need to make sure there isn\u2019t a hangover going into Lord\u2019s.\u201d \u201cAppreciate that Moeen has taken more Test wickets than anyone in the last 12 months, but most of those have been abroad,\u201d says Max Cornell. \u201cTo be fair to him, he\u2019s not the only player clearly underperforming but the difference between Lyon and Ali is astounding.\u201d He bowled brilliantly against India last year on a similar pitch to this. My opinion is that he deserved to play in this game, because of his superb bowling form in the past year, but it was obvious by Saturday evening that his confidence was gone. With Moeen, you need to act quickly, which England didn\u2019t do in the last Ashes. This match was pretty similar to Old Trafford 1997. Australia chose to bat first in seam-friendly conditions; they fought back from an early collapse; there were two centuries from Steve and nine wickets for the spinner. And England were thrashed. \u201cCummins\u2019 four wickets are somehow even more impressive than Lyon\u2019s six on this surface,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cBroad bowled extremely well in this match but Cummins is something else, on another level.\u201d He is an absolute champion, the best all-weather bowler in the world along with Bumrah. I love the man. \u201cChanging four players after one defeat that was at least in part down to going down to ten men early on smells a bit desperate,\u201d says Jon McKinley. \u201cBringing in a fit quick bowler and a different spinner who can bat a bit might just do the trick. Even though the Aussie top three averaged 13 - mainly due to Khawaja\u2019s second innings 40 - I suspect they\u2019ll keep faith with them for Lord\u2019s.\u201d Yes, the balance between staying calm and making necessary changes is always tricky. What it comes down to is whether we really think Denly, Moeen and Bairstow are going to get runs or wickets in this series. I don\u2019t think Denly or Moeen will. Bairstow might, but he\u2019s averaging five in his last 10 Test innings at home and he looks like his head is still at Lord\u2019s on 14 July. Read all about it! That\u2019s Australia\u2019s first win at Edgbaston since 2001. They were 122 for eight on the first day and they won by 251 runs; that, folks, is a towelling. They were too resilient, too secure and just too good for a bits-and-pieces England side who are carrying far too many passengers to beat a side of this quality. Australia were quite brilliant. WICKET! England 146 all out (Woakes c Smith b Cummins 37) That\u2019s it! Woakes loops a bouncer to second slip, where Smith takes the catch to complete a glorious comeback - both for him and Australia. 52nd over: England 146-9 (Woakes 37, Anderson 4) \u201cRob, I agree with your Lord\u2019s line-up, assuming you haven\u2019t already changed your mind, but I\u2019d have Stokes ahead of Buttler,\u201d says Romeo. \u201cThey won\u2019t make so many changes though.\u201d I was torn on that. Stokes is a much more natural Test No5, but he asked to go down to No6 in the winter because of the hangover from his bowling. The ideal solution is Bairstow (when in form) at No5, Stokes at No6 and Buttler the keeper at No7, but I don\u2019t want to waste serotonin having that conversation again. I agree that they won\u2019t make so many changes. I think Moeen will go, and that will be it apart from the injury-enforced replacement of Anderson. 51st over: England 141-9 (Woakes 36, Anderson 0) Siddle, as Adam says, deserves a wicket in this innings after a forensic spell this morning. He should have had one there - but Woakes was dropped by Smith at second slip. It was a fairly sharp chance to his left, and Smith couldn\u2019t get down quickly enough. Frankly I\u2019m not sure his batting, excellent though it is, is adequate compensation for such errant fielding. \u201cLet\u2019s go full Pakistan!\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cBurns, Sibley, Bell-Drummond, Root, Stokes, Foakes, Woakes, Curran S, Archer, Leach, Broad. You\u2019re telling me they\u2019d score fewer runs than the current XI? I think not.\u201d 50th over: England 136-9 (Woakes 31, Anderson 0) Nathan Lyon has a dream. In it, every batsman in the world is a left-hander. He is toying with Anderson, who does well to play out a maiden. I\u2019m still not sure why he\u2019s out there as his facial expression suggests he is exacerbating his calf injury. \u201cCan anyone explain to me why Ali is still in the squad?\u201d says Max Cornell. \u201cAnyone?\u201d He\u2019s taken more Test wickets than anyone in the world in the last 12 months. Happy to help. (He\u2019ll probably be dropped for Lord\u2019s, though, because his confidence has evaporated again.) 49th over: England 136-9 (Woakes 31, Anderson 0) Chris Woakes has quietly had an excellent game with the bat - 68 runs without being dismissed. He should bat No8 at Lord\u2019s, whether Moeen plays or not. In other news, I have no idea why Jimmy Anderson is batting at all as he\u2019s clearly struggling. 48th over: England 136-9 (Woakes 31, Anderson 0) Anderson survives the hat-trick ball, and spares England one last ignominy. Lyon has been so good: 18-4-44-6. \u201cCan we start talking about the second Test please?\u201d says David Horn. \u201cA nine-day break gives plenty of time for selection conversation. Here\u2019s an opening gambit: Leach for Ali, Archer for Anderson (if fit / unfit), and a discussion about Foakes vs. Bairstow - while acknowledging that they\u2019ll never make three changes after just one Test.\u201d I\u2019ll probably have changed my mind by 4pm, but at the moment my team would be: Burns, Sibley, Root, Roy, Buttler, Stokes, Foakes, Woakes, Archer or Stone, Broad, Leach. That wicket gives Lyon another five-for. He has bowled quite masterfully in helpful conditions - and now he has his sixth wicket! Broad goes first ball, beautifully caught by Smith at slip, and Australia are one wicket away from a brutal victory. Oh, and Nathan Lyon is on a hat-trick, all of them left-handers. Lyon dismisses Moeen for the ninth time in the last 11 innings. Moeen pushed forward at a lovely offspinner that flew off the edge and was taken by Warner in the gully. 47th over: England 135-7 (Moeen 4, Woakes 30) Moeen has a couple of close shaves off the bowling of Siddle. A check-drive flies just out of Siddle\u2019s reach in his follow through, and then he leaves a ball that misses off stump by this much. Thanks Adam, hello everyone. Let\u2019s get this over with, shall we. 46th over: England 133-7 (Moeen 2, Woakes 30) Time for Steve Smith, on for an over before drinks. \u201cYou\u2019re a genuine all-rounder, Smudge,\u201d Paine roars through the stump mic. He is landing his stock delivery a lot more since the ban compared to when he was captain and seldom bowled in the nets. As soon as I typed that he bowled a full toss at Woakes but he doesn\u2019t put it away. Maiden, and drinks! With that, I\u2019ll pass the baton to Rob Smyth to see you through to the end of this Test Match. Speak to you all again at Lord\u2019s. Bye! 45th over: England 133-7 (Moeen 2, Woakes 30) Siddle is back on for Pattinson after his poor over. He absolutely deserves to get into the book after his excellent spell this morning. After the lbw shout there is another next ball, which is almost identical. They don\u2019t use the DRS this time around though, keeping their final review in hand. NOT OUT! Yep, going over the top. Lovely bit of bowling, beating the inside edge, but the right decision was made on the field. HAS SIDDLE PICKED UP MOEEN? To DRS we go for lbw. Joel Wilson turned it down but Paine liked it. Looked high to me. We\u2019ll see. 44th over: England 132-7 (Moeen 2, Woakes 29) Lyon to Moeen, who defends and leaves nicely to the applause of local crowd. \u201cEasy, easy, easy!\u201d they chant at the end of the maiden. Now into \u201cit\u2019s all gone quiet over there,\u201d at the Australian tour group, which is quite good. 43rd over: England 132-7 (Moeen 2, Woakes 29) Back to back boundaries for Woakes off Pattinson! Two lovely shots too, nailing a pull out to the Hollies then whipping attractively to the same part of the ground for the same result. He then makes is three in the over, slapping a ball from well outside the off-stump to the point rope. The runs don\u2019t matter but he\u2019s batting with proper confidence here. If Moeen does keep his spot for Lord\u2019s, there\u2019s a very reasonable argument that he should drop behing Woakes in the batting list. 42nd over: England 120-7 (Moeen 2, Woakes 17) Moeen is off the mark from Lyon. That shouldn\u2019t be a big deal but, well, we all know how well this has worked out in recent years. The crowd recognise the moment too, clapping Moeen\u2019s sweep for two. And he\u2019s through the rest of it without too many concerns, either. With Moeen under the pump big time in terms of keeping his spot, a handy half-century, or something like that, could be very important for him. 41st over: England 118-7 (Moeen 0, Woakes 17) It is Pattinson (thanks for listening, Tim) but it doesn\u2019t quite work to plan. Not yet, at least. It won\u2019t take him long to find his range, I am fairly surely. \u201cIf England get Steve Smith\u2019s personal total from here, we can still win this,\u201d laughs Richard Harman. And Adam Giles: \u201cWoakes to score 200 off 150 and Ali to score the rest, including hitting Lyon for 36 in an over. You heard it here first.\u201d We have another wish from Konstanze Kwiet \u201cI would like Steve Smith to bowl. Feels like Christmas.\u201d Not the craziest idea. He\u2019s... bowling better now? \u201cCollo, not only could you be \u201cback in time for dinner\u201d tonight, but this match is taking on the same concept of the highly-underated BBC2 show of the same name, with a very 90s Ashes theme,\u201d says Nick Toovey. \u201cJason Roy, Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow are peeling off calendar years to relive England Ashes disasters of yesteryear. At this rate, Karl Power could walk out again dressed as an England batsmen and it won\u2019t make much difference to this limp effort.\u201d 40th over: England 114-7 (Moeen 0, Woakes 13) Woakes deals with the majority of the Lyon over confidently enough, taking one behind square. Moeen once again leaves two deliveries from around the wicket. It can\u2019t be long before the spinner busts out that straight one again, the ball that did Moeen a beauty on morning three. 39th over: England 113-7 (Moeen 0, Woakes 12) Woakes gets them singing in the Hollies, carving Cummins for one four then deflecting another boundary off his front pad for four leg byes. He gets in a tangle to finish in response to that annoying Cummins short ball that isn\u2019t quite a bouncer - he bowls that length better than anyone. I think it might be time for Pattinson to send down some rockets. \u201cAssuming England get hammered here,\u201d says Kevin Wilson, \u201cI\u2019m hoping this goes the way of 1989 where Root is the only constant in the England squad and they panic each Test, selecting new guys who either score two low scores or take 2-100 and are promptly dropped for other guys who perform just as poorly. I doubt they\u2019ll go down the four captains route though.\u201d In case you were wondering, they have eight days to bounce back. 38th over: England 102-7 (Moeen 0, Woakes 5) England have lost 3/12 since the break. The local lad Woakes reaches out and lashes a wide Lyon delivery to get off the mark first ball. A single to midwicket means Moeen has to face his nemesis for three balls... and he gets through it. Crucially, he picks the correct two deliveries to leave. Two in two balls! Lyon from around the wicket gets so much spin and bounce. Stokes had to play, the edge deflecting to Paine who takes the sharp chance. Lyon now has 350 Test wickets and is about to bowl Australia to a famous come-from-behind victory. Wilson gets one right! The Cummins delivery jagged back sharply at the right hander then sailing out to gully where it was easily taken by Bancroft. As it hit his arm, Bairstow sent it upstairs right away but the technology showed that the ball glanced his glove en route. 37th over: England 97-6 (Stokes 6) 36th over: England 93-5 (Stokes 6, Bairstow 2) Bairstow gets one behind square from Lyon\u2019s first ball, settling well. It\u2019s an important innings for the wicketkeeper - he needs to get into this series. Stokes is smothering the spin for the rest, only once deflecting to the cordon, the rest ending up with the fielders in front of square. Better. 35th over: England 92-5 (Stokes 6, Bairstow 1) Edge, four. Cummins is working at Stokes outside the off stump and the all-rounder waves the bat, lucky not to give one of the three slips a chance. Perhaps as a result of this experience, from an identical delivery later in the over, he can\u2019t quite work out if he\u2019s playing or not, just getting the bat out of the way. Cummins has been outstanding in both his spells today. \u201cThis is all very reminiscent of 2005,\u201d suggests Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cEngland get off to a great start in the first innings of the first test, then blow it completely to lose the game. Still come back to take the urn at The Oval in September.\u201d And an exchange, as told by Richard Harman. Graham Thorpe - \u201cI said, \u2018don\u2019t go dancing down the pitch to Nathan Lyon, Roy\u2019. What did I say Roy?\u201d Jason Roy - \u201cYou said \u2018Just play your natural game, Jason\u2019\u201d 34th over: England 88-5 (Stokes 2, Bairstow 1) There\u2019s a lot going on in every Lyon over here now, turning the ball hard at Stokes with those three catchers still in around the bat. He\u2019s good enough to get off strike around the corner when the spinner is a touch straight, Bairstow doing likewise from the next delivery. Paine is chatting away at both batsmen. That\u2019ll be worth keeping an ear on. \u201cI had forgotten how good it is to see English wickets tumbling into the abyss of defeat,\u201d says Chris Hanson following on from Australia. \u201cA glorious sight.\u201d \u201cI was at Lord\u2019s in 1993 (Atherton run out on \u201899 and all that) and on the last day Chris Lewis, a handful of minutes before lunch, charged Tim May, declined to play a shot and was stumped by what felt at the time like 40 yards,\u201d recalls Alan Synnott. A fine off-spinner himself, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why Synno remembers this well. \u201cIt\u2019s in here at 29:40. Not a great game for Chris all told.\u201d Catch up on the week that was in the Shires with Gary Naylor\u2019s round-up, including a lovely bit about Glenn Maxwell. That\u2019ll do! After beating Buttler to begin the over he castles him to finish, hitting the top of off-stump with the perfect off-cutter. Class. 33rd over: England 85-5 (Stokes 0) Righto, the players are back on the field. Cummins will be starting the session running away from me at the pavilion end, Buttler the man on strike. PLAY! \u201cDear Mr Collins.\u201d Hello, Bob Wilson \u201cWith the assembled talents of OBO emailers at your disposal and your own wide ranging career experience of politics, sports-writing (and an unexpected spot of catalogue modelling), I\u2019m disappointed that there has been no mention of the real take-away from this match. All that feared Hollies Stand booing, sledging and general disobligingness really worked. Smith was deeply affected. He blew that 2nd inns 150 like an 8 year old girl with confidence issues. Talk about mental disintegration. Fans at other grounds should follow suit and chivy him into an early grave (or a thousand runs in the series). Same thing happened to Shane Warne in 2005, I seem to remember. It is always a good idea to give Australians the general Bronx cheer. They\u2019re a very undefiant bunch.\u201d I wonder what will happen at Lord\u2019s next week? It can get a bit loose in the Compton and Edrich Stands these days. Then again, when Amir made his comeback in 2016, the booing lasted three overs. \u201cAll I remember of the last session at Cardiff was that I found a screen in a pub to watch it on\u201d emails Geoff Wignall. \u201cI can\u2019t recall the name of the pub nor even which town/city it was in but I do remember the cricket. And that whichever pub it was sold Timothy Taylor\u2019s Landlord.\u201d What an odd thing memory is. \u201cWith regards to the lbw shout against Root in Lyon\u2019s previous over, the \u201cbat-behind-the-pad\u201d technique needs dealing with by general umpiring consensus, if not a definitive rule of some sort,\u201d says Adam Giles. \u201cI would add, however, that the umpires have done well with consistency in such a regard in this match, seeing as a certain Mr. Wade is a rather experienced proponent of such a tactic.\u201d Like so many things in cricket, you have to know it when you see it. I don\u2019t know if there is a way of policing in any formal way, is there? Gareth Frith reports that he is watching the Lancs 2nd XI play Oman today. Is Glenn Maxwell playing? What about Haseeb? Or Parko? \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Australia declare 8 or 10 overs earlier leave England more of a possible-but-not-really-gettable total to tempt them and give themselves more time to get the 10 wickets?\u201d asks Stephen Brown. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like rocket science.\u201d My guess is that they didn\u2019t want to give England anything even remotely chaseable - drive them into the ground, and so on. The reality is, on a fifth day track, they alwas had time to get this done. \u201cJust wondering when you\u2019re due to switch with Rob?\u201d asks Richard Jansz-Moore. \u201cNeed to know whether England can survive long enough for Rob to get into the hot seat to provide the necessary despair to describe England\u2019s failure. Or whether you will be lucky enough to write about the glory of Australia\u2019s triumph?\u201d Drinks in this session. So, it should be Rob. But don\u2019t rule out six wickets falling in an hour here. We know that games like this have a habit of finishing in a real hurry when a spinner gets on one. Lunch time emails. \u201cI\u2019m a total newbie to following cricket,\u201d writes David Brazil. \u201cHaving been at Lord\u2019s and enjoyed the ecstasy and then abrupt agony of seeing Ireland almost do well but then get humbled against England. What a brilliant sport! I spent too long \u2018consuming\u2019 Premier League football and missed more exciting cricket tussles down the years. The highlight of my short-run cricket appreciation so far is Googling \u2018nervous 140s\u2019 to work out if yesterday\u2019s OBO description of Steve Smith was freshly minted or another sporting clich\u00e9. So if you start inventing terms you\u2019ve at least one extremely gullible reader today.\u201d Wonderful! Welcome to our sport\u2019s dysfunctional family. \u201cMore Cardiff 2009 love / hate,\u201d says Jack Jorgensen. \u201cI was on my then girlfriend\u2019s (now wife\u2019s) family farm 3 hours east of Perth. ABC feed of the TMS coverage and, I think, Channel 9 coverage on the TV. I egregiously went to bed thinking we had it in the bag. What a disappointment to wake up to a draw, but what admiration for Panesar and Anderson. Hopeful, albeit not entirely sure of, a different outcome today.\u201d It\u2019ll be worth staying up for tonight. Always worth it. It\u2019s something I miss about living in Australia: late night Tests from England. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi Suzy McAnanama-Brereton. \u201cI was in New York when my boyfriend at the time (now my husband) introduced me to cricket through the Guardian OBO. Being an American who only knew cricket as that weird game that kept putting brown patches in the middle of my soccer field, it was difficult to follow by just reading. Regardless, I had the utmost respect for Collingwood batting for almost 6 hours, and then when all hope seemed lost, Jimmy and Monty batting until the close of play. Because of the 2009 Ashes I\u2019m an England fan for life.\u201d Yes! The OBO, as we learned on day one when hundreds (and hundreds) of people told me where in the world they were reading in from, really does bring people together from around the world. \u201cIs this a record for number of decisions overturned in a single test?\u201d asks Matthew Valentine. This is it. I don\u2019t know what the record was before, but I\u2019m sure Andrew Samson noted that we went beyond it at some stage yesterday. Poor old Joel Wilson. Was only promoted to the elite panel a couple of months ago and everything. On that same topic from Mike Daniels: \u201cIn fairness to Wilson, inside edges are very difficult to see/hear. The bowler doesn\u2019t necessarily pick it up either. That\u2019s not a bad decision - those inside edges have been given throughout cricketing history. It\u2019s not new and is no evidence of umpires being worse today. It\u2019s only that we\u2019ve now got the technology that can turn back time and allow for a second (or third) look - a facility that was denied umpires in the past.\u201d Yep, I\u2019m more sympathetic than most as well. Where he\u2019s really let himself down are the leg before decisions: Wade and Root. Both fairly obviously not out when watching in real time. He\u2019s frazzled. \u201cBilal Shafayat is inside the stumps,\u201d lols Eamonn Maloney, \u201cwith a fresh pair of gloves.\u201d It\u2019s time for a Where Are They Now on him. Four wickets across the session. Australia\u2019s morning, without doubt. I\u2019m going to take a break and grab a bite to eat. Back with you soon. 32nd over: England 85-4 (Buttler 1, Stokes 0) Lyon to Stokes and he has three catchers on the off-side: slip, gully and silly point. This was what I referenced in the preamble before play- Lyon, 24 hours ago, shadow-batting as a left-hander, working out where he would target. Stokes doesn\u2019t take any bait here though, watching and leaving. One takes off that ends up with slip, but he\u2019s through to the finish line. Well, this finish line, anyway. Four hours (65 overs) to go. For England to be any chance now, their vice-captain will need to face a great many of them. He can think about that at LUNCH! 31st over: England 85-4 (Buttler 1, Stokes 0) Cummins mixes up his lengths to Cummins in what could be the final over before lunch. One keeps low just outside the off-stump; later in the over from the same spot it takes off. Just on a length, he beats him on the drive too! Gotta put that one away for now, Jos. Australia have done really well to get through the set in three mintues, so Lyon will get another. 30th over: England 85-4 (Buttler 1, Stokes 0) Watching back the replay, what a wonderful piece of bowling from Lyon - a classic wicket for an off-spinner with a bit of extra pace and bite. As for Bancroft, what a skilful take too. Little wonder Steve Waugh has described the West Australian as the best bad pad he\u2019s seen. Bancroft will be under some pressure to keep his spot for Lord\u2019s (correctly or otherwise), but catches like that help an awful lot. Stokes does his job well, the in-form man comfortably defending the rest of Lyon\u2019s set. \u201cSir Richard Hadlee, Sir Ben Stokes\u201d says Tim Paine through the stump mic. I guess that works? One over from Cummins to come. Textbook! Lyon over the wicket, Root jumping forward, the inside edge found, Bancroft holding his pose and snaffling it expertly. 29th over: England 85-3 (Root 28, Buttler 1) The end of a dangerous Cummins over. He\u2019ll get six more balls before lunch. Australia aren\u2019t far away from busting this innings, and match, right open. HAS CUMMINS GOT BUTTLER LBW? Joel Wilson says no. Paine wants them to have a look upstairs. NOT OUT! Umpires call on height; the England star survives. \u201cGood decision, Joel.\u201d I know the game isn\u2019t about umpires but I really am pleased for him there. 28th over: England 84-3 (Root 27, Buttler 1) Lyon should get three more in here before the long break. Around the wicket to Buttler with three catchers around the bat, he has to make a good decision in response to every delivery. The bowler gets excited when Buttler misses a clip but there is only half an appeal. Maiden. Dangerous. 27th over: England 84-3 (Root 27, Buttler 1) Siddle\u2019s fine spell continues from our pavilion or broadcast end. This is a touch less dangerous, mind, singles exchanged early in the over, Root then finishing with a compact clip through square leg for two. \u201cHi Adam!\u201d Sarah Jane Bacon, always great to hear from you. \u201cIs it too late to pitch in with my whereabouts in \u201809?\u201d Not at all! \u201cWatching the match on the telly in Dubai! It was brutally hot out there, naturally, but even the global financial meltdown couldn\u2019t stop a few stalwart fans like us. PS. Go you good thing, Gazza!\u201d I have a lot of emails, by the way. I\u2019m not ignoring them, just getting through as fairly and quickly as possible between the action. 26th over: England 80-3 (Root 24, Buttler 0) As David Gower notes on TV, they could live to regret that at 6pm when needing a review with men around the bat. Buttler leaves the only ball he has to look at, so very close to turning back into his off-stump! Oohs and aahs! Lyon has his man! Denly shut up shop to him from around the wicket, inside edging to short leg for the easiest of chances. He reviews the decision at the last possible moment but that\u2019s a terrible call, the ball clearly deflecting off his edge into the pad before ballooning to Bancroft. He\u2019s out AND burned a review. Shocker. 25th over: England 77-2 (Root 22, Denly 10) Siddle gives Denly nothing, the Kent veteran in all sorts of strife on the fourth stump line, edging him into the cordon then beaten by a beauty. Forget what I said about the big quicks, Paine will surely stick with Siddle. \u201cI was fielding in a Sunday match for Crouch End back in 2009, so I missed the whole thing,\u201d says Ben Mimmack. \u201cThe opposition were nice enough to tell us how amazing it was when we came in at the end of the innings though.\u201d Reminds me of the end of the 2012 Premier League. I was in the middle of a (productive!) spell with the new ball somewhere in Cambridge, learning what happened down at fine leg after an over. \u201cShame you missed the chance to write, in a first-ever occurrence, the phrase \u2018Buzzing stump stopped play\u2019 says John Starbuck. Urrrrgh, I\u2019ll never forgive myself for this! \u201cIn 2009 I was doing what I always do: following the OBO.\u201d 24th over: England 77-2 (Root 22, Denly 10) Denly again attacks through the legside, men everywhere on the side of the ground both in close and on the rope. He gets one away to begin then later in the over, after Root gives the strike back via a sweep, takes a big swing. He doesn\u2019t make full contact but gets one more to midwicket. Changing direction to around the wicket at Root, Lyon misdirects with the ball spinning down leg and past Paine for four byes. 23rd over: England 70-2 (Root 21, Denly 8) It\u2019s all on Root here, isn\u2019t it? He clips a couple of Siddle\u2019s first ball, defending and leaving the rest. Against the new man Denly, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see Pattinson and/or Cummins back for a quick burst right away. 22nd over: England 68-2 (Root 19, Denly 8) Oooh! Denly isn\u2019t far away from gloving the first ball of his day down the legside. There is an appeal but no review. Denly said before the Test that this was the most important week of his career. He\u2019s clearly decided that to make the most of this opportunity he has to have a pop at Lyon, twice sweeping him to the rope in the space of four balls in an over where a wicket has already fallen! Great contact. Plenty going on here at Edgbaston. With the stump mics up, we can hear the Australians getting stuck into him straight away for his early shot selection. Speaking of stump mics. \u201cI think we need to call off play for a few hours whilst a preferably very lazy and incompetent technician goes to take a look at it,\u201d suggests Oliver Atkinson in relation to the dodgy off-stump. \u201cFor the integrity of the game you see.\u201d David Seare on that same topic: \u201cDo you they choose a new stump from a box a similarly aged ones?\u201d But will it fit through the two hoops in the ump\u2019s pocket? Roy has danced at the second delivery of Lyon\u2019s new over, the ball turning through the gate and crashing into his middle stump! Yuk. 21st over: England 59-1 (Roy 28, Root 18) Siddle draws another false stroke from Root, skipping off the outside edge for four through the cordon. It kept a bit low too. The veteran is dangerous today. \u201cI was at that time living in Brussels,\u201d recalls Eva Maaten of that day in 2009. \u201cWe had been to see an afternoon movie with our young daughter and were utterly amazed to find the match still going on when we got into the car for the drive home and turned on TMS on longwave. The 7 year old daughter was slightly bemused. Happy days.\u201d How Test Matches time-stamp our lives. Great, aren\u2019t they? 20th over: England 54-1 (Roy 28, Root 13) Roy sweeps and sweeps well, getting Lyon away. The captain tried the same stroke on earlier in the over and missed. But later in the over, Roy then jumps on the front foot for a couple more forward of square. Not the worst way to play Lyon early, who is so dangerous when he gets into his rhythm. 19th over: England 47-1 (Roy 22, Root 12) Ooh, so close for Siddle. The ideal place to land on the final day, hinting away off the seam - nice and full. Roy prods - his outside edge clipped - but the ball lands just next to the right glove of the diving Paine, sneaking through for four runs as well. Siddle nearly sneaks through the other way from the next ball, hitting the pad but via the inside egde. Excellent. \u201cWe haven\u2019t blocked out day five for a draw in a decade,\u201d notes Matthew Tom. \u201cSo we\u2019ve lost every time we\u2019ve tried. Is it really *that* crazy to have a go for once?\u201d Look, it\u2019d be great craic. And I might get back to London for dinner tonight with England all out by 2pm. So, maybe they should? \u201cThanks for the 1987 Preliminary Final link,\u201d writes Peter Salon. \u201cStill might not mean much to UK readers, but Fergus, an old bloke I played cricket with who was a Melbourne fan was so distraught he walked home. From Melbourne to Monbulk. Forty-two kilometres. Took him three days, and he never spoke of what the things he had seen. I have always seen this as the apotheosis of mourning a sporting loss.\u201d Perfect. Please put me in touch with Fergus so that I can interview him. I trasncribed the commentary of the final stages a couple of years ago - \u201cPOOR OLD MELBOURNE\u201d. 18th over: England 43-1 (Roy 18, Root 12) Lyon gets one over before drinks and is immediately up for lbw. I tell you what, Root might be very lucky there. Aleem Dar said that the England captain was playing a shot with his bat hidden well behind his front pad. So, had Australia reviewed - on the basis of Dar\u2019s assessment - it would have been impact outside the line. But as Atherton says on television, Root has pulled the wool over the umpire\u2019s eyes there. DRINKS! 17th over: England 41-1 (Roy 18, Root 10) As Athers notes of Wilson, it is like being a player out of form for Wilson. Considering the toughest part of his Test might be ahead of him with men around the bat later in the day, his heart must be pumping. Of course, Siddle was bang on the money in this his first over, having already beaten Root outside the off-stump before the lbw that wasn\u2019t. \u201cHave the England team all carefully chosen slightly dodgy batting gloves today so they can regularly call for replacements from the dressing room?\u201d asks Robin Hazlehurst. \u201cI seem to remember Jimmy and Monty using that tactic quite well in 2009. And the random visit the from the physio to give them a pat on the bottom and then run back off. I hope our bottom-patters are ready for plentiful slow jogs out the middle today. England are likely to need them.\u201d We should be so lucky to have a final hour filled with that nonsense. NOT OUT! There was an inside edge! That is the tenth incorrect decision from Joel Wilson in terms of those sent upstairs in this Test Match. What a harrowing experience this must be for him. HAS SIDDLE TRAPPED ROOT? He\u2019s given and reviewed for a second time! Stand by! 16th over: England 40-1 (Roy 18, Root 9) Good again from Roy, for the second time in two overs driving confidently through cover for four. Cummins was operating at Root earlier in the over, the captain looking quite useful early on here. From Geoff Wignall: \u201cSo since the time of 122/8, Australia have managed 649/9 and England 394/11. That isn\u2019t just down to Jimmy\u2019s injury.\u201d Brutal. Max Connell on that theme: \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought that when Australia were 122-8, England would still need to bat the entire fifth day to save a DRAW? If we escape with a draw I certainly hope that the time between this and the next test is spent trying to find some way, any way at all, to get Smith out before he manages to put a decent score together.\u201d And from Timothy Sanders. \u201cCharlotte Bront\u00eb summed it up for me, in her early days as cricket correspondent for the Keighley Evening News,\u201d he begins. This should be good. \u201cCall anguish \u2014 anguish, and despair \u2014 despair; write both down in strong characters with a resolute pen: you will the better pay your debt to Doom.\u201d 15th over: England 34-1 (Roy 14, Root 8) Nope, there is another delay. \u201cA mini-fan in the stump cam has gone off,\u201d reports the public address system. They finally go out and actually replace the stump in question. We can hear the Australians getting stuck into them about it; hard to know exactly what the theme of their chat is but it is a distraction they are trying to take advantage of. Earlier in the marathon Pattinson over, Roy struck the shot of the morning through cover for four. In reply to the delay, Pattinson immediately bumps him, the opener getting well underneath. \u201cOver the last few days each innings has sored higher than the last and contained more overs, I see no reason for this trend to not continue, England are more than capable of knocking out 350+ as they did in the first innings,\u201d insists Antony Stones. His email is entitled \u2018blind optimism,\u2019 I should add. \u201cAll they need to do is figure out how to take Smith\u2019s wicket given he is a one-man lynchpin for the Aussies.\u201d Very droll. Very good. Smith should bowl today just to mess with England. Maybe sooner rather than later, come to think of it. The photo of me at Lord\u2019s is from 2005 not 2009, but yes, the long hair was a real thing for a really long time. Delay! The stumps are buzzing?! Odd scenes, there is something buzzing in the stump and Roy has heard it. Root comes up to meet him and tell the umpire \u201cyou would\u2019t want that to come up on snicko!.\u201d The ground staff do something or another. We\u2019re back. 14th over: England 30-1 (Roy 10, Root 8) Cummins turn and he\u2019s once again peppering Roy at pace, beating his outside edge with one that moves appreciably off the seam. He gets off strike with one past short leg. A second boundary in as many overs from Root, pushing carefully down the ground, timing it just well enough. This is just what the captain needs to do early on: survive by scoring regularly. \u201cI was sunbathing underneath an apple tree in the Cotswolds, TMS on, oblivious to wasps, crossing each ball and minute off on a piece of sweat-dripping graph paper,\u201d reflects David Alcock. \u201cBy far the most exciting test I\u2019d ever listened to, I barely even remembered to drink cold beers... Ah, memories.\u201d Indeed. Simpler times. Just the global financial crisis to worry about. \u201cIn the spirit of avoiding the term \u2018collapse\u2019, I\u2019m hoping any kerfuffle this morning can be avoided in favour of heroic resistance,\u201d notes David Seare. \u201cIt would be good to see Root stick in and not give it away after reaching fifty. His talent deserves bigger scores than his concentration allows at times.\u201d Athers makes a good point on telly. Looking back at Burns\u2019 dismissal, it would have sailed over his head in the first innings but the variable bounce helps quicks as well as spinners. Lyon will be licking his lips. 13th over: England 25-1 (Roy 9, Root 4) NOT OUT! It is going down the legside by a mile, making another Joel Wilson error. Dear me, that isn\u2019t much better than the Wade one that he gave yesterday. Root hit a lovely four off his back foot through point from the ball before to get off the mark. \u201cMorning Collo.\u201d Nick Toovey, g\u2019day. \u201cCardiff ten years ago was spent draining cans too quickly on a mates sofa in Wandsworth that we, under some duress, had to send his girlfriend out to replenish as we didn\u2019t want to leave the sofa. This led to a barrage of foul language during the inexplicable decision to bowl Marcus North at the end of the day (still don\u2019t understand why it wasn\u2019t Peter Siddle) that my mates flatmate complained about. I don\u2019t think I was ever invited back, come to think of it.\u201d Quelle surprise! \u201cI remember the day 5 of the 1st 2009 test very well,\u201d says Chris Parker. \u201cIn the South of France with my parents, me and my dad huddled around my laptop listening to TMS on the balcony, my mam ready to go out looking very annoyed, and our French neighbourhoods for the week looking very confused at the whole situation. Quite a ridiculous scene, fitting for a ridiculous match.\u201d There is a theme emerging here: everyone was on holiday! Habib Butt is \u201cpraying\u201d for Headingley 2001 rather than Cardiff 2009. Habib, I can assure you, that is not happening. IS ROOT OUT LBW TO PATTINSON? He has been given out but going upstairs! 12th over: England 20-1 (Roy 9, Root 0) Deary me, this is both RAPID and brilliant from Cummins. Roy leaves close to his stumps early in the over, which means one thing: the bouncer is next and it is scrary-quick. Backing up from that, an all-but unplayable that pitches on the stumps and jags away, beating the edge on the way through. \u201cReturned from a weekend away that afternoon,\u201d Richard O\u2019Hagan says of 2009. \u201cListening to the final session on an old longwave radio whilst pottering around the garden and entertaining my then two-year-old son. Having to avoid swearing when Collingwood got out, due to presence of said infant. All work and play slowly drifting to a halt as each over passed and Jimmy and Monty dug in for anything but an Australian victory. Happy days.\u201d And Simon Jessop has a question for us. \u201cI need some crowd-sourced wisdom. I\u2019ve found myself in Brum for work (which was booked months ago without considering the ashes and not ever thinking these things go to the fifth day anymore!) and my office is 15 minutes from the ground. Do I stay in Office and attend some dull but worthy meetings or do I sack it all off and head to the ground asap?! My heart is saying one thing but my civil service soul (which is tragically deep) says stay. Crikey.\u201d Simon, there is only one answer to this question. You understand that. You\u2019re asking this so I confirm your instincts. Get down. 11th over: England 20-1 (Roy 9, Root 0) Roy takes one early in the over, subjecting the captain to a tough examination first up. Pattinson is moving the ball away from Root then angling it back in, all at around 90mph. Today might be about Lyon later on but the two big quicks are giving Australia a huge burst of energy early on. \u201cWhile you\u2019re talking Cardiff \u201909, can I put in a plug for Monty Panesar\u2019s recently-released autobiography (ghostwritten by my brother)?\u201d Sure thing, Thomas Atkins. \u201cFor all that one associates him with comedy fielding and slapstick batting, it\u2019s interesting how he claims he\u2019d really been working on his batting and as a result regards it as one of his finest achievements rather than the streaky knockabout fun that it\u2019s often seen as. Obvious bias notwithstanding it\u2019s a really good book and contains some interesting angles on the characters of that period, as well as his background as a Luton-born Sikh, and the mental battles that he and many of his teammates faced.\u201d Thanks. I\u2019ve seen him promoting it around the traps. I\u2019ll read it. \u201cMoving on to to today, I got stuck in the rain on the Sussex Downs this morning, and the only thing that lifted my spirits was the thought that there\u2019d likely be some of it at Edgbaston too. Particularly piqued that none of it seems to have made its way up there.\u201d It would take a big shift in the weather for rain to hit today. 10th over: England 19-1 (Roy 7, Root 0) Root gets in behind the one ball he has to deal with in the successful Cummins over. \u201cHey Adam.\u201d Hi Brendan Large. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one not planning on watching or following along today. There is no way that Australia can be as unlucky/England can be so lucky in this 2nd innings and the thought of being obliterated by Australia at Edgbaston in the first test of an Ashes is just too much. I literally cannot bare it. Good luck England and god speed. (I hope to be able to enjoy the OBO in the aftermath of a great escape).\u201d Nothing quirkier than not watching/leaving early. This won\u2019t mean much to UK readers but will for those on the Guardian Australia platform. My dad decided that we should leave the 1987 Preliminary Final early. We were in the VFL Park carpark listening on the radio when Gary Buckenara kicked the winner after the siren. CRAZY! He has done plenty right in this match but Burns has been done for raw pace here! Cummins\u2019 short delivery got big on him, the opener unable to out of the way in time. In the end, the ball hit the shoulder of his bat and lobbed out to Lyon in the gully. Superb fast bowling. The overseas TMS link. Here you go. I stress: overseas link. If you\u2019re in the UK, go to the BBC website or something like that. 9th over: England 18-0 (Burns 11, Roy 7) That the stump mics are being left up between deliveries hasn\u2019t been such a big deal when Edgbaston has been full. You hear a bit, but not heaps. Today, though, with the ground about a third full, we can hear everything. Needless to say, Matt Wade is just as loud at mid-off as he was when wicketkeeping. This should be fun. Pattinson to Roy, who is more than happy leaving the first few alone as both players find their range. Directing straighter, the opener has to keep out a full ball right on the money and is then struck on the pad, but it is going well down the legside from my vantage point. No review. Roy gets his first run for the day behind square, Burns seeing out the rest. I saw some crazy stuff on twitter overnight suggesting that Roy should have a pop at 398 and all the rest. That\u2019s not how this works. 8th over: England 17-0 (Burns 11, Roy 6) What a lovely way to start for Burns, getting onto his front foot and driving Cummins down the ground for four! By facing this first ball, Sky tells me, the opener becomes the fourth English man to bat on all five days of a Test Match. Top response from Cummins, beating the left-hander with a ball he had to play at. Burns leaves the next two and defends the last with a straight blade, the crowd applauding the stroke. They get it. Jerusalem is playing, which means we are a couple of minutes away from a resumption on this fifth day. Roy and Burns enter the field of play from my left, Paine and his Australians following suit from my right. Cummins will bowl the first over. PLAY! \u201cI was at Wembley stadium for Oasis (There last ever UK stadium gig),\u201d recalls Neil Harris. Nice. \u201cLuckily I had club Wembley tickets so had access to TV\u2019s, lots of us crowded around applauding every ball whilst a concert was going on outside (The Enemy \u2013 00\u2019s Brit Indie band). Monty saved the match and we all went out into the stadium to the sound of Kasabian on Fire.\u201d Less good that bit! \u201cAs much as I appreciate the intent is your preamble optimism, this game is dead as Disco,\u201d insists Kristian Petterson. \u201cThe only interest lies in how well England can push back against the psychological impact of having their faces ground into the dirt yesterday. A creditable performance will at least mean they can \u201ctake the positives\u201d; a real smashing and this series could be toast. All of which is to say, in County Cricket Live parlance, DOOOOOMED.\u201d This is mainly why I\u2019m keen to see this go deep into the final session. If England are cooked here, well, yes. I share your view. \u201cI was listening to the Cardiff epic on the way back from Alton Towers,\u201d recalls Steve Castle. \u201cMy stomach was already in knots after an unwise decision to take repeated rides on Oblivion, and I was frankly in such a state as Jimmy and Monty bravely blocked, nudged and ducked I should not have been behind the wheel of a vehicle.\u201d 2009 is such an underrated series. If not for 2005, sigh. Free TV, sigh. \u201cRe The Open,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou are almost correct, but instead of the Great White Shark competing for the Claret Jug, it was the venerable Tom Watson. He eventually lost out in a heartbreaking play-off to Stewart Cink. I\u2019ve always felt a tiny bit of sympathy for Cink - that day was the culmination of all those years of practice, commitment and focus, and yet everybody loathed him for pipping Watson.\u201d Of course! That makes a lot more sense. Norman did come close to winning a major around that era though, didn\u2019t he? \u201cI always have to think twice about whether I turn on Liveblog updates or not,\u201d writes Anthony Noel. \u201cAs an England fan this morning, who also needs to pay attention at work today, the question is: do I active the Liveblog alerts switch, or do I just check in manually every now and again? Automatic alerts will presumably only be bearers of bad news, whereas the optimist in me can remain undisturbed so long as I leave my phone alone. On the other hand, if I was an Aussie this morning I\u2019d want to be notified about every single development because each little message will bring another bit of good news.\u201d Stick with me through the day and everything will be okay. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d If it isn\u2019t the master predictor Kim Thonger! \u201cI\u2019m assuming that the English batting will find itself in a \u2018spot of bother\u2019 at some stage today, but may I make a plea in advance for total avoidance of the word collapse? It\u2019s become hackneyed, and I\u2019d like to put in a good word for some of the fine alternatives available to us, such as crumple, disintegrate, cave in, slump or subside. Fine words all of them, and they deserve their time in the sun, or even in warm but slightly overcast and weather.\u201d When writing on collapses, there\u2019s a lot of *right click/synonym* going on, which means I give all of these a run. A touch harder with the OBO when you get once chance, and no time to edit, but I\u2019ll try. How about this prediction from Kim Thonger?! Some other bits and pieces to dig into. Geoff wrote about Travis Head. Barney on Smith, via Dylan. Ali, too. Where were you in 2009? All over the place. \u201cOn a family holiday in a house somewhere outside Barcelona,\u201d says CricViz gun Pat Noone. \u201cWe somehow found a radio channel on the TV playing TMS and all huddled around listening to it all. Happy days.\u201d His colleague Ben Jones, also of the CricViz genius factory, was but a wee boy back then: \u201cMum made me pause it when Monty and Jimmy came together, because Sunday lunch waits for nobody - not even Bilal Shafayat.\u201d This is adorable. Alex Macdonald notes that he was \u201csending text messages to mates rather than using twitter,\u201d which is how I remember it too. I didn\u2019t realise until a few months later that I could use twitter on my phone, so my reflections each day at stumps came via what we would now call on that platform, a thread. Simpler times. \u201cI was on holiday in Turkey. 15 at the time,\u201d replies Luke Gravener. \u201cCycled for 20 minutes into town to the nearest sports bar to watch the last day...by the end it was full of English fans cheering every ball. Think I bought about 17 cokes!\u201d How did you experience those 52-minutes at Cardiff in 2009? In that era, I was working for the Australian Prime Minister and had taken a couple of rare weeks off to coincide with the first two Tests. Of course. I was at Cardiff for Ponting\u2019s 150 but watched a lot of rain. By the Sunday, I was in a little village called Baston in Lincolnshire where I had spent a couple of months during the 2005 Ashes bashing around playing cricket and being your stock-standard 20-year-old Australian backpacker. Evidence of that. Anyway, four years on I was back. Was Greg Norman not close to winning the Open that day too, falling just short? That\u2019s how I like to remember it. It was hot. But nobody at the Spinning Wheel boozer had Sky. So we crowded around a TV and listened to the TMS call that way. Peter Siddle giving his all; Mitch Johnson not quite dependable enough - despite having had a very good match, it is so often forgotten. Nathan Hauritz so unlucky. Ben Hilfenhaus underbowled. Marcus North! There is a scene in Barney Douglas\u2019 new film The Edge that documents that final hour at Cardiff is so incredibly well, thanks in large part due to Felix White\u2019s score. We discussed this with them at length in an interview from Geoff and my pod the other week. But yes, be sure to see that film if you want to re-live Monty and Jimmy. Where were you? Let\u2019s start there as we open the batting on my inbox for the day. If you want to tweet me, that works too. At lunch yesterday, Nathan Lyon walked out into the middle of the ground and looked deeply into the soul of the 22 metres that matter most. At both ends, he surveyed the rough on offer. Instructively, he then lined himself up to shadow-bat as a left-hander, doubtless signalling to the southpaws in the home dressing room that he would be coming from them in the fourth innings of this match. The off-spinner isn\u2019t today\u2019s only actor, but he will play the most important role. Nowadays, he bowls with confidence in the final stanza - with numbers to match. If England have to survive 540 deliveries, about 250 will be from Australia\u2019s most accomplished finger-spinner of all time. That\u2019s some degree of difficulty. I can report that from my desk that it is a stunning morning with barely a cloud over over Birmingham. If the hosts are going to manage this, and pull off something Cardiff-esque, they won\u2019t be helped by missing a couple of hours due to rain. Could Jimmy feature again, as it did ten years? I\u2019ll let that thought sit with you. Welcome to day five at Edgbaston. Sure, instead of the four results on the table we had yesterday that is now wound back to two thanks to the heroics of Smith and co. But provided the home side can dig in across the first session, this promises to be fascinating all the same.",

A downpour causes leaks that could trigger an electrical fault in vital machinery keeping a patient alive. Parts of the NHS are crumbling. Badly needed repairs across the estate have been costed at \u00a36bn.</p> \n<p>Hospital trusts have not been able to put their houses in order for years. Capital spending in the NHS has been severely squeezed. Trusts making a surplus have not been allowed to spend it because of government spending limits.</p> \n<p>Chris Hopson of the membership organisation NHS Providers talks of \u201cnine years of austerity and \u00a34.3bn of capital funding diverted to keep day-to-day NHS spending in balance\u201d. The Department of Health and Social Care raided the capital fund to bolster revenue, to pay for running costs such as doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 salaries and medicines \u2013 the items that were hardest to cut in the years of belt tightening.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e0c6a050-08f9-4be0-9c61-9f198c0cbcb9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dyZ69_F-nJU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Of the \u00a31.8bn that Boris Johnson has announced for the NHS, \u00a3850m appears to be genuinely new money, destined for 20 new projects, which have been listed in his announcement. Luton and Dunstable will get \u00a399.5m for a new intensive care block. Norfolk will receive \u00a340m for four new hospital wards. Barking, Havering and Redbridge will get a \u00a317m health and wellbeing hub. The NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, talks hopefully of \u201cmodern facilities with state-of-the-art equipment\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the further \u00a31bn is largely money that went into the NHS capital fund, that trusts had saved but were not allowed to spend.

      "bodyText": "There are hospital operating theatres that have to be closed when it rains too hard. A downpour causes leaks that could trigger an electrical fault in vital machinery keeping a patient alive. Parts of the NHS are crumbling. Badly needed repairs across the estate have been costed at \u00a36bn. Hospital trusts have not been able to put their houses in order for years. Capital spending in the NHS has been severely squeezed. Trusts making a surplus have not been allowed to spend it because of government spending limits. Chris Hopson of the membership organisation NHS Providers talks of \u201cnine years of austerity and \u00a34.3bn of capital funding diverted to keep day-to-day NHS spending in balance\u201d. The Department of Health and Social Care raided the capital fund to bolster revenue, to pay for running costs such as doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 salaries and medicines \u2013 the items that were hardest to cut in the years of belt tightening. Of the \u00a31.8bn that Boris Johnson has announced for the NHS, \u00a3850m appears to be genuinely new money, destined for 20 new projects, which have been listed in his announcement. Luton and Dunstable will get \u00a399.5m for a new intensive care block. Norfolk will receive \u00a340m for four new hospital wards. Barking, Havering and Redbridge will get a \u00a317m health and wellbeing hub. The NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, talks hopefully of \u201cmodern facilities with state-of-the-art equipment\u201d. But the further \u00a31bn is largely money that went into the NHS capital fund, that trusts had saved but were not allowed to spend. It falls far short of what is needed, say experts including Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, who likened the prime minister\u2019s announcement to \u201can absent landlord saying he\u2019ll mend the shower, but the broken toilet, damp walls and dodgy electrics will have to wait\u201d.

      "bodyText": "You didn\u2019t have to ask, did you, when you heard about the latest shootings in the US? You didn\u2019t think: \u201cWell, there are a hell of a lot of women out there who are utterly alienated, possibly with mental health issues, who have very screwed up attitudes about migrants in the US, so \u2018the shooter\u2019 in each case will clearly be one of them.\u201d You just knew. Before you get into the \u201cnot all men\u201d groove, let me just say, no, not all men are murderous, for which I suppose I must be thankful. But I am not actually. Not at all. Not all men rape either, but in this country we have watched rape become virtually decriminalised because the justice system is so poor. Many men will be as appalled as I am about all this. Good. Lobby to change things. You have the power. What\u2019s shocking about mass shootings is how ordinary they are. Seven years on from Sandy Hook, the US \u2013 or the parts that apparently matter in this case \u2013 seems to think that the slaughter of small children is a price worth paying for \u201cfreedom\u201d. This predates Trump. No one needs another lecture about gun laws and open carry. We talk as if there is a finite number of people who need to get killed before something changes. We know that number will never be reached and that these men turn the guns not just on others but often on themselves. Two-thirds of US gun deaths are suicides. We know, too, as Joan Smith has documented brilliantly in her book Home Grown: How Domestic Violence Turns Men Into Terrorists, that a lot of these shooters have a history of terrorising the women in their lives. This terror is called \u201cdomestic abuse\u201d. They may well kill their own mothers or, in the case of the Ohio shooter, his own sister. We are familiar with there being links between twisted masculinity and views about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d or the idea that migrants are taking over and taking \u201cour women\u201d. Poisonous rhetoric slimes out of Trump\u2019s mouth daily. The US media doesn\u2019t challenge it much. As Beto O\u2019Rourke said: \u201cMembers of the press. WTF?\u201d You can\u2019t keep referring to people who are not white as invading vermin, then behave as if you\u2019re dismayed when someone acts upon such inducement. Racism towards migrants is churned out in the UK mainstream press, too, posing awkwardly as humour, the unsayable or common sense. It is vile. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d not only means make America white again, it is also a longing for a particular kind of manliness. It is part of the backlash against feminism.

Fights broke out between protesters and men armed with long sticks in North Point, just west of Causeway Bay. In a press conference, police confirmed there had been more than 500 arrests since protests began in June. At least 1,000 teargas grenades were fired as well as 160 rubber bullets. An official said Hong Kong\u2019s police were fully supported by the government and there was no need to deploy the Chinese military. A number of police stations temporarily closed after they were surrounded by protesters, with fires started outside and projectiles thrown at the buildings. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, addressed the media for the first time in a fortnight and refused to step down. She condemned the protesters for interfering with the ability of working class Hong Kongers to earn a living. [The protests have] seriously undermined Hong Kong\u2019s law and order and are pushing our city, the city we all love, and many of us helped to build, to the verge of a very dangerous situation. Beijing will announce \u201csomething new\u201d for Hong Kong tomorrow, according to the South China Morning Post, which cited an anonymous source. More than 150 flights out of the city were cancelled, with many airport staff walking out to join the protests. A car rammed through a barricade set up by protesters in Yuen Long, narrowly missing people trying to hold back the barrier, and injuring one person. A similar incident occurred on Harcourt Road and reportedly injured several people. That\u2019s all for now. Thanks for reading today. Here\u2019s our latest report: And video: A journalist has been arrested, according to the South China Morning Post. Bloomberg\u2019s Aaron McNicholas has tweeted this video of a motorist being attacked by protesters. Rubber bullets are being fired at protesters from the top floor of the police station in Tin Shui Wai, according to reports. Christy Choi has the latest from North Point station, where she has spoken to a witness who said he witnessed an attack on protesters by \u2018men dressed in white\u2019. Inside the station it\u2019s serious business as some protesters get kitted out. Some are carrying bamboo poles, others makeshift shields made from foam bodyboards, others are handing out masks. Knowing that the authorities could potentially track their movements on the public transportation cards, a few people are standing by ticket turnstile at the ready for anyone arriving clad in black. Outside, throngs of protesters gathered to block traffic while pointing lasers at apartment windows, saying those inside had dropped things on protesters earlier. Nearby, 33-year-old Mr Cheung, a hotel employee who declined to give his full name, said he witnessed an earlier attack just past 8 pm local time on protesters by men dressed in white . \u201cSome of the residents told us, 20 of so guys in white shirts holding rods were standing at this junction. The information spread quickly over Telegram \u2026 some of the protesters headed to the police station they came back. Both of us [protesters and men in white] shouted at each other, and they rushed towards us and clung to the barricades and beat us. Then, when more of us came, they ran up that uphill road and into the building and are hiding \u2026 Residents say they\u2019re the gangsters from Fujian and told us to leave, but as you can see the protesters are staying to defend and prevent them from coming back.\u201d It\u2019s going to be a long night, reports the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief, Lily Kuo. Some protesters were also detained in Wong Tai Sin when police charged protesters. They pulled back to a main road they had occupied earlier and others managed to leave by the train. At least nine were detained by police, a witness said. Protesters think the police\u2019s latest tactics are not intended just to disperse them but to catch and arrest them. Protesters leaving Wong Tai Sin say the \u2018frontline\u2019 is still deciding where to go, choosing from among four locations where clashes are occurring. They are going to a safe house now, a primary school, to rest and wait. Police in several locations appear to be making a number of arrests, after protester lines were charged. Meanwhile, demonstrators have been pushed back from North Point police station. In a statement, Hong Kong police said: A large group of protestors are blocking roads extensively and setting fire to miscellaneous objects, posing a serious threat to the safety of the road users at scene. The protestors are surrounding and attacking various police stations and the adjacent Disciplined Services Quarters, hurling igniting objects and hard objects, making damages to the premises. The police strongly condemn the violent acts and warn the protestors to stop all illegal acts immediately. Police is using minimum force to disperse the protestors. A video posted on social media appears to show protesters throwing molotov cocktails into a police station. Meanwhile, there is a standoff between protesters and police in the Wong Tai Sin area. The largest contingent of protesters is now moving through North Point. The report room services at Tin Shui Wai and North Point police stations have been temporarily suspended, authorities have announced. Elsewhere, at Tun Mun police station, protesters have thrown bricks at the building and have lit fires just outside. Fights have broken out between protesters and men armed with long sticks in North Point, just west of Causeway Bay. Earlier, a group of men were pictured nearby. The protests are set to go on into the night, as riot police amass and protesters congregate at a number of locations \u2013 most notably Causeway Bay. Lily Kuo has the latest from Wong Tai Sin Hundreds of protesters have been camped outside the police dormitory since a rally this morning. Demonstrators said the police began firing on them after the crowd spilled out on to a main road. \u201cThey keep shooting teargas at us. The whole MTR station was filled with teargas,\u201d said Harry Tsui, 25, a local resident. He added police have been holding up black and orange flags up throughout the day, warnings they will soon fire teargas and rubber bullets. Protesters are shining lasers at the police dorm and some are throwing bricks at the windows. The police are firing canisters of teargas at the protesters from a distance, which demonstrators are quickly putting out. One protester managed to toss one back into the police dorm, causing the crowd of onlookers and protesters to cheer. Agence France Press has this report on the choices facing China over the unrest in Hong Kong. China has only tough choices as it looks to end more than two months of pro-democracy protests in its semi-autonomous southern city of Hong Kong. The protesters have shown no signs of backing down, despite increasingly violent confrontations in which Hong Kong\u2019s police have regularly fired tear gas and rubber bullets. The protests were triggered by opposition to a planned law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, then evolved into a wider movement for democratic reform and a halt to eroding freedoms. Here are the potential options for the central government as it seeks to end the crisis, and the problems associated with each: 1. More of the same Beijing\u2019s current approach has been to express firm public support for the Hong Kong police and the city\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, while warning the protesters their actions are \u201cintolerable\u201d. \u201cBeijing has adopted an intimidation strategy and is trying to wait it out until at least early September, when (school) term starts \u2013 many protesters are high school and university students,\u201d Hong Kong-based political analyst Dixon Sing said. The party is also preparing for the 70th anniversary of the founding of modern China, and is unlikely to want to take antagonistic steps ahead of that. The wait-and-see approach is similar to how it approached the 2014 pro-democracy \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d in Hong Kong. The 2014 events saw protesters occupy parts of the city for more than two months but faded away without winning concessions from Beijing after key leaders were arrested. But this may not be enough. By waiting, it risks further embarrassment for a government led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that tolerates no dissent. \u201cThe protests in Hong Kong are a serious loss of face for Beijing, and presents a key political and strategic dilemma for the Chinese authorities \u2013 do we intervene, when, and how,\u201d Michael Raksa, assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, told AFP. 2. Give in Beijing could pressure Hong Kong\u2019s government into adopting a more conciliatory tone and finding some way to compromise with the protesters. Their demands include an independent inquiry into police methods, and the permanent shelving of the extradition bill. The government could also orchestrate Lam\u2019s resignation, another key demand of the protesters. \u201cLam has become a colossal political liability both locally and internationally,\u201d said Sing. However doing so would be seen to be giving in to the protesters and rewarding their actions. \u201cThe likelihood of Beijing adopting non-violent, conciliatory measures is low,\u201d Hong Kong-based political analyst Willy Lam told AFP. 3. Up the ante The central government could step up its pressure and intimidation tactics against the protesters. There has already been increasingly strident condemnation from authorities and state media. The Chinese military last week described the unrest as \u201cintolerable\u201d and released a slick propaganda video showing a drill of armed troops quelling a protest in Hong Kong. \u201cAt this stage, (Chinese president Xi Jinping) is gravitating towards a more hardline stance,\u201d Lam said. But if Beijing does not plan to carry out such threats, then there is a risk of needlessly causing further panic. This could trigger a flow of money and companies out of the global financial hub. 4. Send in the troops The most dramatic \u2013 and risky \u2013 strategy for the central government would be to send in military reinforcements. There is already a garrison of thousands of troops from the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) stationed in Hong Kong, though they generally keep a low profile. While Hong Kong\u2019s law states PLA troops \u201cshall not interfere in the local affairs of the region\u201d, it also says they can be deployed to \u201cmaintain public order\u201d. But this last resort could spell financial disaster for Hong Kong and wholesale global condemnation for the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cIt would seriously undermine the political legitimacy of Xi Jinping and the CCP, both internally as well as externally, with widespread international condemnation reminiscent of the 1989 suppression of Tiananmen Square protests,\u201d said Raksa. The Chinese national flag has been taken down and thrown in the sea, as protesters set a tree alight outside the homes of police officers, the South China Morning Post has reported. It is worth taking a look through the detailed reports in this thread too. A truck has passed through a crowd of protesters without slowing down. Police cleared hundreds of protesters from near Tai Po station. Meanwhile, a fire has been started at another police station. Live footage shows it has grown since this was tweeted, as protesters add more flammables to the flames. Christy Choi, reporting for the Guardian, was in Admiralty earlier. A bit of comic relief for protesters in Admiralty, as two Hong Kong politicians were making the rounds. League of Social Democrats\u2019 Avery Ng sauntered about with a loudspeaker slung over each shoulder and cheekily yelled out: \u201cIf you want to tell the cops to fuck off you need a loudspeaker to do it,\u201d eliciting a chuckle from the protesters. Ng says he\u2019s been walking around since this afternoon and that \u201cthe cops have been hiding behind the barriers, randomly shooting teargas canisters at people.\u201d He and Au have been speaking to protesters and police over these loudspeakers. As we were speaking the police slammed their riot shields down with a thud, alarming protesters and causing the chairman of the political party League of Social Democrats to pick up the microphone and yell at everyone to step back and keep a 20-metre perimeter from the police. Protesters are streaming into Causeway Bay. Protesters are staging a sit-in at the airport. CNN is broadcasting from the scene. Earlier, bricks were seen being ferried by wheelbarrow. Here\u2019s the latest from the Associated Press: An official says Hong Kong\u2019s police are fully supported by the government and there is no need to deploy China\u2019s military to cope with increasingly violent anti-government protests. Senior superintendent Kong Wing-cheung of the police public relations branch said chief executive Carrie Lam and other Hong Kong officials have stated the same on multiple occasions. Kong told reporters at a daily briefing Monday that he personally believes there is no chance of a deployment of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Speculation of an intervention by China\u2019s military has been fuelled in part by a slick publicity video it released last week showing troops firing teargas and dealing with a mock street demonstration. Kong said he doesn\u2019t feel the police are being made scapegoats over the violence and are fulfilling their mandate to protect the community and maintain law and order. Crowds of people are heading west to Causeway Bay, Hong Kong\u2019s retail centre, where tens of thousands blocked roads last night. Protesters are leaving Harcourt Road after barrages of teargas were fired at them, according to Quartz\u2019s Mary Hui. There are further reports that teargas was fired directly at peaceful protesters from above. Beijing will announce \u2018something new\u2019 for Hong Kong tomorrow, according to the South China Morning Post. An anonymous source told the paper the Hong Kong and Macau affairs office, which is controlled by the Chinese state council, would make a \u201cnew announcement\u201d on Tuesday. A source familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the office would make statement but refused to elaborate further. Another official with knowledge of the situation told the South China Morning Post that Beijing\u2019s position on Hong Kong remained largely unchanged. \u201cHong Kong will not have the same strategic value to China if the chaos continues. If things come to that, even if the central government wants to save Hong Kong, there is not much it can do,\u201d he said. Earlier, Reuters reported that Hong Kong police said Chinese military police would not be deployed to the territory. Hong Kong\u2019s airport authority has announced it is rescheduling flights, without explaining the reason for the cancellations. Hong Kong international airport has started implementing flight rescheduling at 1200hrs to clear the backlog of passengers. Until 1400hrs today, the airport handled 465 flights wile 77 flights were cancelled. The terminal is also busier than usual. Airport authority Hong Kong advises passengers to contact their airlines, and to proceed to the airport only when their seats and flight time have been confirmed. The airport emergency centre has been activated at 0700hrs this morning to coordinate operations among various business partners at the airport. Airport operations continues to be orderly. It is expected that number of flight movements handled this afternoon and evening will be gradually increased. Away from the frontline protests, a motorist is repeatedly driving around a roundabout. A taxi has just rammed through another crowd of protesters, the Guardian\u2019s Lily Kuo reports. Police have ordered protesters in the Admiralty area to leave. Hong Kong police tweeted: A large group of protestors are currently gathering in the Admiralty area, blocking carriageways near Central Government Complex, Harcourt Road and vandalising the Central Government Complex. After repeated and futile warnings, in face of the situation, anti-riot Police officers have deployed tear gas and minimum force to disperse protestors. The Police appeal to everyone in the area to leave immediately. Dozens of protesters have occupied roads, using traffic barriers and dismantled metal fences to build barricades and road blocks. Outside the New Town Plaza, in Shatin, in the New Territories, protesters are getting more sophisticated and using concrete from a nearby construction site. Passing cars are beeping in support, while the protesters cheer and clap in response. Police say they have arrested 420 people in connection with the protests since 9 June, when they began. They included 379 men and 73 women. The youngest person arrested was 14 and the oldest was 76 years old. Plus, there has been 82 arrests today so far. Yolanda Yu, the acting chief superintendent of the Hong Kong police, said: They used a slingshot and threw petrol bombs and firebombs at police officers.What\u2019s more appalling is that they even set fire to a trolley of trash and pushed it towards police officers. Some even lit up suspected explosives outside a residential building. All these acts pose a serious safety threat to the public. Police did not appear to distinguish between the pro-democracy and anti-extradition law protesters, and the suspected triads who beat people they thought to be pro-democracy protesters in Yuen Long, who they said \u201ctook justice into their own hands,\u201d and beat people \u201cwith different views to them\u201d. Protest permits were denied in recent weeks because police felt \u201cthe organisers of public events do not have the ability to exercise control and ensure the events proceed in a good order\u201d. Some 139 police officers have been injured in the line of duty, with protesters surrounding police stations, throwing petrol bombs, bricks and other hard objects into the building, police said. Across the past two months, police said they have fired off 1,000 teargas grenades and 160 rubber bullets. Judging by social media videos circulating today, that count is likely to rise. The latest photos from the Admiralty area. The Hong Kong government has rebutted \u2018unfounded\u2019 rumours the director of immigration would be joining the general strike today. Regarding an online rumour that the Director of Immigration, Mr Erick Tsang, will go on strike by taking leave today (August 5), the Immigration Department (ImmD) would like to clarify that Mr Tsang was admitted to hospital for medical treatment last week and resumed duty this morning after being discharged from hospital yesterday (August 4). Therefore, it is merely a rumour which is totally unfounded. The [immigration department] would like to reiterate that amid this difficult time, all colleagues of the department will continue to stand fast at the posts, and will give unwavering support to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in effectively administering Hong Kong in accordance with the law and strive to provide the public with services of the best quality. Meanwhile, a number of public services have been suspended \u201cowing to the situation\u201d. The \u201csummer of discontent will continue\u201d, tweets the pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong following the police press conference. Teargas has been deployed on Harcourt Road in Admiralty, near the government headquarters, the Financial Times\u2019 Eli Meixler reports. Reuters\u2019 Vincent Lee has the latest from the police press conference which began at 4pm local time. Hong Kong Free Post\u2019s Kris Cheng has summed up the current state of the protests. Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and historian, has told CNN that the strike today is likely to be the largest in Hong Kong since 1967. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. We\u2019ve had rallies in Hong Kong before, we\u2019ve had protests, but we\u2019ve never had anything where multiple sites around the city have all simultaneously have been the focus of protests. There are a lot of older demonstrators at the rallies today, here to support the students and recent graduates who make up a large number of the protesters. Shum Yu Cheung, 28, a flight attendant who joined the strike on Monday, said: Maybe we can\u2019t change the Hong Kong government but at least we can support the young generation. I hope one day we can have the right to elect our chief executive. It\u2019s unclear how many people have joined the strike today. Organisers said at least 30,000 had not gone to work. Shum said all of her friends had taken off today. South China Morning Post has tweeted a video which appears to show a taxi driving into a crowd of protesters. Police are firing round after round of teargas towards protesters on Lung Cheung Road, in Wong Tai Sin. They had previously warned teargas would be deployed, after projectiles were thrown at them. Officers are now marching up the street to push protesters back, while stopping to regain formation at intervals. The Hong Kong government said in a press release: The report room services of Wong Tai Sin Police Station are now temporarily suspended. Police appeal to members of the public not to obstruct the emergency vehicles access so as to avoid affecting the emergency services provided to the public. Here is a live stream: Demonstrators are apologising to motorists who have been caught in the gridlock, just outside the city\u2019s financial centre. Protesters are preparing to form barricades across Harcourt Road. Police have attempted to remove barricades from across roads elsewhere, but were driven away by protesters, according to reports. Protesters staying out of the 31 C heat are congregating in a mall in Shatin, towards the north of the island, which has been the home of protests every day for more than two weeks now. Dramatic scenes in Hong Kong. Earlier, the embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam addressed the media for the first time in a fortnight and warned that the protests were pushing the Chinese territory towards an \u201cextremely dangerous situation\u201d. Her law and order focused speech, which offered no solutions to the grievances of the protesters or any way forward, appears to have encouraged others to take to the streets and inflamed those already demonstrating, while former chief executive Tung Chee Hwa accused the US and Taiwan of being behind the unrest. \u201cI want Carrie Lam to come out and fix the problem, not give us some bullshit,\u201d said Joel Tse a 25-year-old advertising industry professional. Tse had originally been on the fence as to whether or not he should join today\u2019s general strike, but seeing the chief executive\u2019s press conference earlier today decided to join. He said her answers were unsatisfactory, and that he wanted to make a point that the use of excessive force by the police was unacceptable. Hong Kong International airport is running at a vastly reduced capacity today after 2,300 workers at the continental transport hub went on strike. Airport authority refused to confirm the reasons behind the reduced service, according to CNN. Meanwhile, demonstrators are arriving in the district of Admiralty for one of the protests. Thousands are coming together in support of the general strike in the city, amid protests at a number of locations today. Elsewhere, there appear to be standoffs between protesters and police. Hello, I\u2019m Mattha Busby taking over from my colleague Kate Lyons. Its just after 2.30pm in Hong Kong \u2013 four hours ago a car rammed into a barricade erected by protesters near the Yoho Mall in Yuen Long and injured one person. Protests in Hong Kong have entered their ninth week, as protesters engage in a city-wide strike. The protest is aimed to disrupt peak-hour travel of commuters and is the fifth consecutive day of mass demonstrations in the city. Simultaneous rallies are planned for seven of Hong Kong\u2019s 18 districts. Hong Kong has not held a general strike in more than 50 years. During the morning rush hour for commuters, protesters caused transport across Hong Kong to be brought to a standstill, blocking roads and trains. More than 150 flights out of the city were cancelled, with many airport staff walking out of work to join the protests. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam addressed the media for the first time in weeks, refusing to step down, as many protesters demand. She condemned the protests for interfering with the ability of working class Hong Kongers to earn a living and said that the protests had \u201cseriously undermined Hong Kong\u2019s law and order and are pushing our city, the city we all love, and many of us helped to build, to the verge of a very dangerous situation.\u201d A car rammed through a barricade set up by protesters in Yuen Long, narrowly missing people trying to hold back the barrier, and injuring one person. Across Hong Kong the day of city-wide protests is kicking off, reports Christy Choi. At least seven districts across Hong Kong have rallies planned, according to fliers circulating, with protests planned in: Tai Po, Shatin, Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Wong Tai Sin, Mongkok and Admiralty. However, in keeping with their recent change in strategy, the protests are likely to move location at a moment\u2019s notice. To counter violent police reactions, protesters have been following Bruce Lee\u2019s mantra, to \u201cbe water\u201d, gathering in places and then scattering and moving on to other locations before police can arrive in force. The city\u2019s subway system was back to normal at a quarter to one, after this morning\u2019s strikes, according to an MTR spokesman. Protesters not only blocked train doors from closing, they placed bicycles, trolleys and steel bars on the tracks of the East Rail line that connects the heart of Hong Kong to one of the border checkpoints with mainland China, and wedged fire extinguishers between the train and the platform to stop trains from leaving. \u201cThese should not have been on the tracks. If trains hit these objects there could have been serious consequences,\u201d said the spokesman. Car rams through barricade after violent incident between protesters and driver Witnesses said that around 10am a car tried to drive through a roadblock set up by protesters near the Yoho Mall in Yuen Long, the site of a violent attack on commuters on 21 July. Protesters surrounded the car, holding up umbrellas and forcing the driver out of the vehicle. Some began to deface the car and fought with the driver. Some witnesses said the driver bit protesters. Others at the scene stopped the fighting and first aid volunteers tried to help the driver, who had wounds to his head, but he refused. He eventually got back into his car. \u201cSuddenly he closed the door and window and then started the engine. The demonstrators were nervous and tried to press against the front of the car to prevent him from leaving,\u201d said Derek Man, who was on the road at the time, with the protesters. \u201cThe driver ignored them and continued to accelerate. The tyres emitted a lot of white smoke. The vehicle broke through the barrier and knocked down one person and then he left the scene,\u201d Man said. Another witness, Chun Ming Lam, 25, a resident of Yuen Long said he was on his way to work and standing on a footbridge over the road, when he saw the incident. When he saw the car break through the barrier, protesters began yelling \u201cfirst aid, first aid!\u201d and he ran down to the scene where one person was propped up against the barrier and protesters were applying ice packs to him. A car arrived later to take the man to a hospital, he said. Lam who witnessed the attacks on 21 July, when dozens of masked men beat commuters with wooden and iron rods. \u201cIt was quite scary but I also witnessed the 7/21 incident and others in Yuen Long. It\u2019s not so scary when comparing with that,\u201d he said. A police spokeswoman said the incident happened around 10:30 on Monday. \u201cWe got a call that some people were run over by a car near Yoho mall in Yuen Long, but once police arrived there were no injured, no car and no witnesses to tell us anything.\u201d A pro-Beijing Hong Kong lawmaker Ann Chiang has criticised Carrie Lam, saying she\u2019s disappointed Lam provided no solutions for the current unrest in Hong Kong in her press conference earlier today, reports Christy Choi. Writing on Facebook, Chiang said: \u201cThe Chief Executive raised many questions at the press conference! But what about the solution? Disappointed!!!\u201d The Hong Kong police are confirming to the Guardian they received a call earlier this morning about a car running down people near Yoho mall in Yuen Long, reports Christy Choi. A police spokeswoman said: \u201cThat [incident] happened around 10:30 today. We got a call that some people were run over by a car near Yoho mall in Yuen Long, but once police arrived there were no injured, no car and no witnesses to tell us anything.\u201d Our Beijing bureau chief, Lily Kuo, reports that according to a source one person was injured in the incident. Public broadcaster RTHK has reported that that one third of air traffic controllers have joined the strike. The Hong Kong airport, one of the busiest in the region, cut flights and reduced operations to just one runway, down from two. More than 200 flights have now been cancelled. Some counters at the airport have set up iron bars to control crowds seeking help and the Airport Express, a train to the airport from the city, has been suspended. \u2018Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time\u2019 \u2013 the slogan terrifying Hong Kong\u2019s leaders In the last few weeks, protesters have been chanting and graffitiing this slogan all over the city: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time\u201d, explains Christy Choi, one of our reporters in Hong Kong. It\u2019s the campaign slogan for Edward Leung, a now-jailed advocate of Hong Kong independence when he looked to run to be one of the city\u2019s few elected lawmakers. And it\u2019s making the government here nervous, with Carrie Lam even bringing this phrase up during her press conference on Monday. Lam said the slogan, \u2018Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u2019, was a \u201cthreat to national sovereignty and a call to destroy Hong Kong\u201d. The phrase once associated with a tiny core group within Hong Kong that were advocating independence from China, has now has filtered into more common usage by protesters who are taking to flying flags that read \u201cHong Kong independence\u201d, and the talk of independence is something that China isn\u2019t likely to tolerate. A source who had recently visited Leung said the young activist was pleasantly surprised to see the revival of his election tagline, but also expressed concerns over the situation, SCMP reported. \u201cHe is worried the young people would lose their freedom of taking part in the struggle if they followed his path,\u201d the source said. China is sensitive to any perceived challenge against its sovereignty \u2013 even symbolic ones. Earlier this week a Chinese flag was taken off the flagpole and thrown into Victoria Harbour, and replaced with a flag calling for independence. It drew the ire of city\u2019s former Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who is offering a million Hong Kong dollars reward for any information on who was responsible. And another one, featuring Edward Leung, a leading Hong Kong independence activist. During her press conference, Carrie Lam mentioned that she was aware of a slogan being used by protesters: \u201cReclaim Hong Kong, the revolution is now (or, the revolution of our time)\u201d. Now people in Hong Kong are gleefully tweeting the clip of Lam saying the revolutionary expression. More analysis of Carrie Lam\u2019s press conference from Lokman Tsui, who teaches journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and has been following the protests closely. \u201cShe sounds like a broken record. It looks like she is trying to run the playbook of criticising the unrest and the violence and linking it to economic stability,\u201d said Tsui. \u201cMost of my students and friends are just more angry and annoyed.\u201d A large car has been filmed approaching a barricade in the street where protesters were congregating, then backing up and ramming through it, barely missing protesters.. The videos \u2013 shot from three different angles \u2013 have been circulating on Telegram and are reportedly from today\u2019s protests. The incident happened in Yuen Long, Yoho Mall is visible in the background of the videos. The Guardian is working to confirm that the videos are from today and whether there were any injuries caused by the incident. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market has taken an early hit this morning as the city\u2019s governance crisis continues to mount. With elusive chief executive Carrie Lam about to speak this morning, the Hang Seng index is down 2.2%, outstripping losses on the other main Asian bourses. The Nikkei in Tokyo is down 2% and China\u2019s Shanghai Composite is off 1%. Hong Kong\u2019s political problems have so far played a backseat role in the markets compared with the US-China trade dispute, but it now looks like the crisis is looming larger in the minds of investors. Protesters are not likely to be appeased by the government\u2019s remarks, which were largely the same as before: condemning protesters for undermining stability in Hong Kong and calling on citizens to \u201crally together\u201d against violence. Lam did make one gesture, which is instituting a daily press conference from the police, who have become perhaps the primary focus of the protests after weeks of clashes with protesters, which have involved beating residents and protesters with batons, firing tear gas and rubber bullets on them, and pepper spraying them. The press conference has wrapped up and Carrie Lam has left. Carrie Lam has been asked \u201cwhat extent are you to blame and why have you not resigned\u201d? In response, she has offered the same spiel she has before, that while she handled the extradition bill badly, though says the bill was \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d she has apologised, and is committed to listening to the public. \u201cWhat we have not done well is to explain in a more effective manner.. and the engage more,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think at this point in time, resignation will help find a solution.\u201d After someone questioned the fact that a huge number of civil servants were among those protesting, Lam finally directly answered the question of why she has not yet resigned. \u201cI\u2019m taking responsibility for what we\u2019ve done because I\u2019m the chief executive,\u201d she said. She says that since the extradition bill has raised problems \u201cit is a time for me to continue to lead my team to address those problems and try to bring Hong Kong out of the current difficult situation. I don\u2019t think resignation of myself or colleagues will provide a better solution.\u201d A journalist from the South China Morning Post pointed out that protesters have asked not just for an investigation into the police but an independent commission inquiry into the whole situation, as well as a permanent withdrawal. What is stopping you from taking those actions? You said that the crisis has expanded beyond the bill, so what would you do to deal with that crisis? \u201cSome people may not agree with our response.. but we have considered every factor. What is in front of us is Hong Kong\u2019s stability and future and escalated violence,\u201d she said. Lam also said that protesters were using the controversial extradition bill as a cover for \u201culterior motives\u201d and \u201cto persist with... revolution\u201d. \u201cThose ulterior motives are going to destroy Hong Kong,\u201d she says. Carrie Lam has issued an explanation for why she has not been visible in meeting with protesters and other civil society groups \u201cWe have been constantly thinking about how to improve our governance. I have been having marathon meetings with people from different sectors. Some ask why don\u2019t I meet the press. It\u2019s because radicals will storm wherever I go,\u201d she said. Carrie Lam responded to a question about the role of the police, whom she calls \u201cAsia\u2019s finest\u201d. \u201cThe police force is safeguarding Hong Kong\u2019s law and order and ensuring Hong Kong\u2019s ongoing safety. \u201cI\u2019m very sad every time I meet with the commissioner that the force is under extreme pressure... I appeal to the media to have a bit more understanding of the difficulties faced by police during this time. \u201cThe same harassment that I have described\u201d \u2013 she said that she is threatened and targeted by protesters \u2013\u201d have been extended to the families of the police.\u201d Asked what she has done to respond to demands from demonstrators, Lam said the government has responded, just not in a way that will necessarily satisfy protesters. Lam points out that the government\u2019s independent police complaints council has begun looking into the attack on commuters on 21 July by suspected triad gangs. Paul Chan, the financial secretary, also addressed the crowd earlier in a speech that was essentially a list of numbers that illustrated the hit to the Hong Kong economy of the protests. Lam, flanked by her entire cabinet, is now taking questions from the gathered press. At the last press conference, which was the day after a violent attack by suspected triads on protesters and commuters, tensions were especially high. Lam sidestepped questions and spent much of the time condemning both sides for violence. Frustrated journalists yelled at her to \u201cspeak like a human.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s deputy chief executive Matthew Cheung called on all civil servants to \u201cstand together\u201d. More than 4,000 civil servants have signed letters condemning the government, in a rare display of defiance for the normally politically neutral government bureaucrats. On Friday, thousands of civil servants attended a rally on despite orders from the government for them to stay \u201ctotally loyal\u201d to the chief executive. Among the other things Carrie Lam said was that the demonstrations were destroying the livelihoods of working class people and \u201cbreaking their rice bowls\u201d. She said that from today, police would hold a press conference every day. Matthew Cheung, the chief secretary of Hong Kong, is speaking now. He is calling for civil servants to stand together. Lam opened her press conference by condemning protesters\u2019 behaviour from over the weekend, including when demonstrators took down a Chinese flag from a pier and threw it into the sea. Lam said protesters were \u201cbullying\u201d those with different opinions. The chief executive added that people may choose to strike but they should \u201crespect the rights of others to go to work\u201d. \u201cAre we using the lives of 7 million people and Hong Kong\u2019s future as leverage?\u201d Carrie Lam has spoken to the press about the ongoing protests. \u201cSuch disruptions have seriously undermined Hong Kong\u2019s law and order and are pushing our city, the city we all love, and many of us helped to build, to the verge of a very dangerous situation. \u201cAs a result of these widespread disruptions and violence, the great majority of Hong Kong people are now in a state of great anxiety, some of them don\u2019t know if they can still take some forms of public transport, while other right now are being blocked from going to work. \u201cWe all love Hong Kong... This is the time for us to rally together to set aside differences and bring back order and say no to chaos and violence.\u201d The last time Hong Kong\u2019s leader, chief executive Carrie Lam addressed the public was three weeks ago today. She has been virtually in hiding since then, which has further fuelled anger at the government\u2019s response to weeks of protests. At the last press conference, which was the day after a violent attack by suspected triads on protesters and commuters, tensions were especially high. Lam sidestepped questions and spent much of the time condemning both sides for violence. Frustrated journalists yelled at her to \u201cspeak like a human.\u201d Expectations are not high that Lam will respond meaningfully to protesters demands, which include the permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill that the protests in June, as well as an independent investigation into police behaviour. This the first time Carrie Lam has spoken to the press in more than two weeks. Carrie Lam is addressing the press pack now. Our reporter, Christy Choi, is in the room waiting for Carrie Lam to speak. She was due to appear seven minutes ago. As the city enters its ninth consecutive week of protests, demonstrators have begun shifting strategies while authorities arrest more people and deploy harsher tactics against them. On Sunday night and the early hours of Monday, police clashed with protesters and residents in various locations, after protesters evaded and frustrated the police by holding flashmob demonstrations throughout the city. The strategy was for groups of protesters to scatter and switch locations at the last minute, disappearing before riot police were able to arrive en masse. There are huge delays across Hong Kong today as a city-wide strike, targeting commuters during peak hour, has caused serious delays across the transport system. Our reporter Christy Choi has been travelling on the MTR, the rail service in Hong Kong was on a train that was held up and then everyone was ordered off the train. \u201cThis is very unusual,\u201d she says. \u201cThings normally run like clockwork.\u201d Cindy Chan, an officer worker for a utilities company who was ordered off the MTR at Taikoo station said despite the disruption she supported the protests, which she called a \u201clast resort\u201d for the people of Hong Kong. \u201cI really support it, but I can\u2019t do it because coming from the pressure of the company so I try my best to get to work,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst of all the government doesn\u2019t listen to the opinion of the people in Hong Kong and later on you can see it getting worse and worse.\u201d Chan is not happy with what she sees as inaction from the government, which she says has demonstrated their bias by not investigating police. \u201cIt makes those people who support the protesters even more angry and divides society,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to be proud of law and order in Hong,\u201d said Chan. \u201c[I would] rely on the police to combat crime, but now I see them and I\u2019m afraid of them, and hate them. I hesitate whether I should seek help from them. This is very different. Hong Kong is different from before.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s leader, chief executive, Carrie Lam, a target of the protests, is set to address the media at 10am local time. Lam, who has been the target of many of the protests over the last two months, has disappeared from public view for the last two weeks, as protesters call for her to step down. As the city enters its ninth consecutive week of protests, demonstrators have begun shifting strategies while authorities arrest more people and deploy harsher tactics against them. On Monday, transport across Hong Kong was brought to a standstill and more than 150 flights out of the city were cancelled due to a city-wide strike, as protesters and residents engage in mass civil disobedience to protest their government. Almost 100 outbound and 100 inbound flights were cancelled at Hong Kong on Monday, due to the strike, with Hong Kong airport posting a warning that \u201cpotential circumstances on Monday, 5 August might affect airport operation\u201d and advising passengers to check with their airlines before heading to the airport. Protesters also blocked key roads and trains, as shops and businesses shuttered for the day.",

      "body": "<p>Those 157 years of history were not out there on the pitch. They were in the away sections of Eastleigh\u2019s Silverlake Stadium, where 796 fans of Notts County gathered on Saturday to resume the ordeal of supporting what was, until May, the oldest professional football club in the world with a continuous league history. Only in England, surely, could a fifth-tier match attract a crowd of 2,668, of whom almost a third had travelled half the length of the country to watch their team, so recently humiliated, attempt to take the first steps towards rehabilitation.</p> <p>There was to be no immediate reward for their faith. Fans of all ages, shapes and sizes went home having seen their players beaten 1-0, with two men sent off in the latter stages. Their team had created no meaningful chances and showed none of the residual characteristics of fallen aristocrats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/26/alan-hardy-notts-county-league-two-football-league\">Alan Hardy the speedster leaves Notts County stuck in reverse | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, given recent history, those fans were grateful just to be there. Less than a month earlier a handful had travelled to London to hear the proceedings in the high court where the club\u2019s owner for the past two years, a local businessman named Alan Hardy, had been granted a three-week extension over payment of a tax bill of more than \u00a3250,000, a debt that had seemed likely to send Notts into administration and possibly extinction. Hardy, having bought the club for \u00a35m and spent a similar amount, had put the club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/notts-county-owner-alan-hardy-puts-club-up-for-sale\" title=\"\">up for sale</a>, but his promises of having identified potential buyers were no longer believed, particularly after his office decoration company \u2013 the source of his wealth \u2013 also went bust. This, after all, was the club where a consortium called Munto Finance strolled in 10 years ago boasting of Middle Eastern backing, installed Sven-Goran Eriksson as director of football, attracted a couple of big-name players, and was then revealed to have no money at all. The club was sold for \u00a31, since when illusions have been thin on the ground at Meadow Lane.</p> <p>As recently as February it was possible to joke about Notts\u2019 plight, particularly when Hardy added another stain to his plummeting reputation by accidentally sending an intimate photograph of himself out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/notts-county-owner-hardy-apologises-for-posting-intimate-picture-online\" title=\"\">on social media</a>. The response, at the next home match, was the sight of a thicket of giant inflatable penises brandished by the fans in the away stand. Within months the joke had turned sour as Notts lost their relegation battle and their historic status along with it. Even less funny was the news that the club\u2019s staff, including the players, had gone without their wages for two months. On 25 July the fans of Nottingham Forest passed round buckets at the City Ground during a friendly against Real Sociedad, collecting money to help the employees of their local rivals.</p> <p>But then Hardy finally redeemed himself by selling the club to a pair of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/26/alexander-christoffer-reedtz-notts-county-league-two\" title=\"\">young Danish brothers, Alexander and Christoffer Reedtz,</a> the owners of a statistics firm, Football Radar, which calls itself a provider of football betting advice. While the sum they paid Hardy \u2013 who was looking for \u00a37m\u2013 has not been announced, it is known that debts to HMRC, other sums owed to local traders and the staff\u2019s unpaid wages have been dealt with in full, which seems like a decent start.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"284ca0a6607cf64ff546f0cd613422b5f77f794f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/284ca0a6607cf64ff546f0cd613422b5f77f794f/0_0_3658_2439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enzio Boldewijn takes on the Eastleigh defence during County\u2019s defeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enzio Boldewijn takes on the Eastleigh defence during County\u2019s defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Bardens/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Vanarama National League is not the outer darkness. Nor is it a quicksand from which there is no escape, as Leyton Orient proved last year, like Macclesfield and Tranmere the season before. Some Notts fans may even find it a pleasant change to make their way to grounds like Eastleigh\u2019s, strolling past a meadow filled with cow parsley and the moss-covered lichgate of St Nicolas\u2019s parish church to reach the pleasant little home of the Spitfires, as Eastleigh are known.

      "bodyText": "Those 157 years of history were not out there on the pitch. They were in the away sections of Eastleigh\u2019s Silverlake Stadium, where 796 fans of Notts County gathered on Saturday to resume the ordeal of supporting what was, until May, the oldest professional football club in the world with a continuous league history. Only in England, surely, could a fifth-tier match attract a crowd of 2,668, of whom almost a third had travelled half the length of the country to watch their team, so recently humiliated, attempt to take the first steps towards rehabilitation. There was to be no immediate reward for their faith. Fans of all ages, shapes and sizes went home having seen their players beaten 1-0, with two men sent off in the latter stages. Their team had created no meaningful chances and showed none of the residual characteristics of fallen aristocrats. And yet, given recent history, those fans were grateful just to be there. Less than a month earlier a handful had travelled to London to hear the proceedings in the high court where the club\u2019s owner for the past two years, a local businessman named Alan Hardy, had been granted a three-week extension over payment of a tax bill of more than \u00a3250,000, a debt that had seemed likely to send Notts into administration and possibly extinction. Hardy, having bought the club for \u00a35m and spent a similar amount, had put the club up for sale, but his promises of having identified potential buyers were no longer believed, particularly after his office decoration company \u2013 the source of his wealth \u2013 also went bust. This, after all, was the club where a consortium called Munto Finance strolled in 10 years ago boasting of Middle Eastern backing, installed Sven-Goran Eriksson as director of football, attracted a couple of big-name players, and was then revealed to have no money at all. The club was sold for \u00a31, since when illusions have been thin on the ground at Meadow Lane. As recently as February it was possible to joke about Notts\u2019 plight, particularly when Hardy added another stain to his plummeting reputation by accidentally sending an intimate photograph of himself out on social media. The response, at the next home match, was the sight of a thicket of giant inflatable penises brandished by the fans in the away stand. Within months the joke had turned sour as Notts lost their relegation battle and their historic status along with it. Even less funny was the news that the club\u2019s staff, including the players, had gone without their wages for two months. On 25 July the fans of Nottingham Forest passed round buckets at the City Ground during a friendly against Real Sociedad, collecting money to help the employees of their local rivals. But then Hardy finally redeemed himself by selling the club to a pair of young Danish brothers, Alexander and Christoffer Reedtz, the owners of a statistics firm, Football Radar, which calls itself a provider of football betting advice. While the sum they paid Hardy \u2013 who was looking for \u00a37m\u2013 has not been announced, it is known that debts to HMRC, other sums owed to local traders and the staff\u2019s unpaid wages have been dealt with in full, which seems like a decent start. The Vanarama National League is not the outer darkness. Nor is it a quicksand from which there is no escape, as Leyton Orient proved last year, like Macclesfield and Tranmere the season before. Some Notts fans may even find it a pleasant change to make their way to grounds like Eastleigh\u2019s, strolling past a meadow filled with cow parsley and the moss-covered lichgate of St Nicolas\u2019s parish church to reach the pleasant little home of the Spitfires, as Eastleigh are known. They will also find teams keen to test themselves against the representatives of a club that occupied a place in the top flight as recently as 1992 \u2013 sharing with Luton and West Ham the distinction of being relegated from Division One to Division One as the Premier League came into existence \u2013 and won the FA Cup 125 years ago by beating Bolton at Goodison Park, and which later this season can celebrate the 25th anniversary of beating Ascoli to win the Anglo-Italian Cup under Howard Kendall.

Other matters were fixed at the last minute, including sponsorship: fans buying the new season\u2019s replica shirts in time for the match found a blank square on the front, in the middle of the famous black and white stripes.

Instead of tweeting about l\u2019amour, the French have seemingly taken to calling it \u201clove\u201d. They are also posting about ghosting, orbiting, zombieing, gatsbying, marleying, haunting, stashing and a host of other dating pitfalls that, you would be forgiven for thinking, can only happen in English. Not so, cried the French government. \u00c7a suffit.</p> <p>Franck Riester, Emmanuel Macron\u2019s minister of culture, has this week <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/french-ministers-to-have-a-word-over-rising-use-of-english-ccp6zrnd7\" title=\"\">announced</a> his intention to enforce, or strengthen, on digital platforms the decades-old Toubon law, which compels advertisers to make sure they say things in French. Something they really haven\u2019t been doing. From Air France telling flyers that \u201cFrance is in the air\u201d to the 2024 Paris Olympics commission promising sports fans the world over that the games are \u201cMade for Sharing\u201d, advertising in French is increasingly overrun with global online English, the flattened lingo of social media and the media that follow it.</p> <p>Of course, every time a government talks about the purity of the language, hackles are raised. For kids in the 1990s, being told to call their Walkman a <em>baladeur</em> just felt daft. It was a Walkman, it said so right there on the plastic lid. Love, though. Is the trend to forgo the perfectly adequate French term an indication that love, too, in modern life, is something so new the kids need a special way of talking about it?</p> <p>Refreshingly, though, Riester \u2013 along with the RTL journalist speaking to him \u2013 isn\u2019t talking about what the kids are doing to French.

      "bodyText": "Le fran\u00e7ais is the language of l\u2019amour. But there, it appears, lies le rub. Instead of tweeting about l\u2019amour, the French have seemingly taken to calling it \u201clove\u201d. They are also posting about ghosting, orbiting, zombieing, gatsbying, marleying, haunting, stashing and a host of other dating pitfalls that, you would be forgiven for thinking, can only happen in English. Not so, cried the French government. \u00c7a suffit. Franck Riester, Emmanuel Macron\u2019s minister of culture, has this week announced his intention to enforce, or strengthen, on digital platforms the decades-old Toubon law, which compels advertisers to make sure they say things in French. Something they really haven\u2019t been doing. From Air France telling flyers that \u201cFrance is in the air\u201d to the 2024 Paris Olympics commission promising sports fans the world over that the games are \u201cMade for Sharing\u201d, advertising in French is increasingly overrun with global online English, the flattened lingo of social media and the media that follow it. Of course, every time a government talks about the purity of the language, hackles are raised. For kids in the 1990s, being told to call their Walkman a baladeur just felt daft. It was a Walkman, it said so right there on the plastic lid. Love, though. Is the trend to forgo the perfectly adequate French term an indication that love, too, in modern life, is something so new the kids need a special way of talking about it? Refreshingly, though, Riester \u2013 along with the RTL journalist speaking to him \u2013 isn\u2019t talking about what the kids are doing to French. They squarely took aim at politicians and journalists, their gist being that a spoken language is a living thing, it evolves and adapts to whatever new reality it encounters \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t have to do so in English. They also highlighted the neologism, \u201cinfox\u201d, which has quite successfully been adopted as a thoroughly French translation of fake news: an elegant mashup \u2013 or \u201cmot-valise\u201d \u2013 of information and intoxication. Doesn\u2019t the very term mot-valise succinctly prove the point? \u201cWord-suitcase\u201d is the literal translation, and it just isn\u2019t the way we would go about things in English. The French term instantly takes you places, much like \u201cquatre-vingt-dix-neuf\u201d (you know that one from school, surely, but \u201cfour-twenty-ten-nine\u201d AKA 99) and \u201cpresqu\u2019\u00eele\u201d (a peninsula, or, literally, an almost-island) do.

      "body": "<p>In the comedown off the adrenaline high resulting from The Fate of the Furious, the eighth and most recent entry in the franchise of dizzyingly lucrative pedal-to-the-metal blockbusters, the future of the series seemed dicey.

His threat came even though renewed trade talks between Chinese and US officials in Shanghai ended on a seemingly positive note two days earlier, with both sides describing the talks as \u201cconstructive\u201d.</p> \n  <p>In a statement today, China\u2019s central bank said that \u201ctrade protectionism and tariffs on Chinese goods\u201d caused the weakening of the yuan, after it let the Chinese currency fall through the 7 to the dollar level for the first time since 2008.</p> \n  <p>Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, has looked at the global impact.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Despite this breach of the 7 mark, we still don\u2019t expect Chinese policymakers to be comfortable with major weakening of the yuan. The concerns about triggering large financial capital outflows remain. Indeed, there are obvious tactical and time-specific considerations behind today\u2019s move.</p> \n   <p><strong>Further weakening of the yuan means that, globally, the pressure for the US dollar to strengthen is rising. This tends to be bad for the global economy. </strong>Moreover, the breaching of a previously defended important international benchmark, implies more uncertainty and variability on currency markets. Indeed, today other Asian currencies were also under pressure against the US dollar.</p> \n   <p>Such dollar strength will be unwelcome in Washington DC. President Trump has openly complained about a strong dollar and has threatened to try to weaken the US dollar. If the US government were now to take action to weaken the US dollar, that would be bad news for economic policymakers in Europe and Japan. In both places, currency appreciation would be very unwelcome at a time that growth is already faltering.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a212ca31491ad4422b37066f858dd4f1da01edc1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a212ca31491ad4422b37066f858dd4f1da01edc1/0_239_3581_2149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women talk in front of a screen showing stock prices at a securities company in Beijing on 5 August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women talk in front of a screen showing stock prices at a securities company in Beijing on 5 August.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d47f6c38f08c7e177d44d40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-05T09:33:36.156Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Back to the markets, where the share sell-off continues.

The PBoC has spent hundreds of billions of dollars over the past couple of years to prevent their currency from breaching this key level, but now that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. In fact, the currency tool may be very effective as it significantly offsets the impact of US tariffs.

      "bodyText": "The Chinese currency has today fallen through the symbolic seven-to-one-dollar level for the first time since May 2008. The drop came after Donald Trump\u2019s threat of new tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday, and has sparked fears that the US-China trade war is turning into a full-blown currency war, which could damage global growth. Trump was quick to accuse Bejing of \u201ccurrency manipulation\u201d and \u201ca major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!\u201d in a tweet today. The yuan\u2019s drop has triggered a sell-off on global stock markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has lost more than 500 points, a 1.9% fall, while in London, the FTSE 100 index is trading nearly 180 points lower, a 2.37% decline. Dow Jones down 504 points, or 1.8% at 25,980 S&amp;P 500 down 1.9% at 2,875 Nasdaq down 2.67% at 7,487 UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 177 points, or 2.4%, at 7228 Germany\u2019s Dax down 1.55% at 11,688 France\u2019s CAC 40 down 1.79% at 5,263 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.98% at 8,810 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 1% at 20,834 Japan\u2019s Nikkei down 1.75% at 20,720 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng down 2.85% at 26,151 Tesco and HSBC have both announced thousands of job cuts in the last few hours. Good-bye and thank you for all your comments \u2013 we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The US services purchasing managers\u2019 index is out: it has risen to 53.0 in July from 51.5 in June, signalling stronger activity in the service industries. The composite PMI, which includes manufacturing, has increased to 52.6 from 51.5, \u201cto signal a moderate expansion in overall business activity,\u201d according to the survey compiler, IHS Markit. The rise was led by services firms which registered a faster increase in output, with manufacturers only recording a slight upturn in production. Meanwhile, in China the service industries have recorded lower growth. Earlier today, the Caixin/Markit PMI slipped to 51.6, the lowest reading since February, from 52.0 in June. Tesco is to cut 4,500 jobs at 153 high street Tesco Metro supermarkets, in the latest round of redundancies to affect staff at the UK\u2019s biggest groceries chain, writes my colleague Rob Davies. Jason Tarry, the supermarket\u2019s UK and Ireland boss, said: In a challenging, evolving retail environment, with increasing cost pressures, we have to continue to review the way we run our stores to ensure we reflect the way our customers are shopping and do so in the most efficient way. We do not take any decision which impacts colleagues lightly, but have to make sure we remain relevant for customers and operate a sustainable business now and in the future. Earlier this year, it emerged that chief executive Dave Lewis was planning to slash \u00a31.5bn from Tesco\u2019s cost basein an effort to rebuild profits, which have never recovered from the 2014 accounting scandal. Fishmonger, butcher and baker jobs at the store giant were expected to be at risk, along with counter staff. BREAKING: HSBC isn\u2019t the only company cutting jobs today. Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, said it would cut 4,500 jobs at 153 Tesco Metro highstreet supermarkets. The opening bell has just rung on Wall Street. US stocks have fallen more than expected. Dow Jones down 414 points, or 1.56%, to 26,070.81 S&amp;P 500 down 46.62 points, or 1.59%, to 2,885.43 Nasdaq down 181.37 points, or 2.27%, to 7,822.71 The European Central Bank has warned in its economic bulletin today that global trade will only pick up gradually in coming quarters and will remain weaker than overall economic activity. Weak trade has been the biggest drag on global growth for much of the past year as a tariff war between the US and China damaged confidence and held back investment, particularly among manufacturers. The ECB said: Despite some signs of recovery, global trade is likely to remain more subdued than activity in coming quarters. Downside risks to the outlook for trade have partially materialised in recent months due to the implementation of higher tariffs, and the threat of a further escalation of trade tensions persists. Gold prices have surged to a six-year high, as traders look for safe-haven investments. Spot gold is currently up 1.6% at $1.463.40 an ounce, after rising as high as $1.464.60, its highest level since May 2013. Global stocks have declined for the sixth day in a row and yields on US 10-year government bonds have dropped to a near-three-year low. Financial markets around the world have fallen sharply amid growing fears that the US-China trade dispute could escalate into a full-scale currency war, with damaging consequences for the world economy, writes our economics correspondent Richard Partington. Read the full story here: If you are wondering what the US-China trade war is really about, have a look at our Q&amp;A: Donald Trump has responded to the drop in the yuan to below seven-to-one dollar, accusing Beijing of \u201ccurrency manipulation\u201d. Traders are bracing for a full-blown currency war, after the People\u2019s Bank of China allowed the yuan to drop below a level it had previously defended with sustained vigour, of seven-to-one dollar \u2013 its lowest level since May 2008. The move came after Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on Chinese imports on Friday, intensifying the trade war between the two countries. This has led to a sharp sell-off on world stock markets, as traders worry about the consequences for the global economy. UK\u2019s FTSE down 2.15%, or 158 points, at 7,248 Germany\u2019s Dax down 1.6% at 11,681 France\u2019s CAC down 2.08% at 5,247 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 1.06% at 8,802 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 1.02% at 20,831 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is expected to fall 350 points or more after the opening bell. Asian shares also tumbled on Monday, led by Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, which lost 2.85% as city-wide strikes brought Hong Kong to a standstill. In a statement, China\u2019s central bank linked the yuan\u2019s weakness to the fallout from the country\u2019s trade war with the US. The PBOC said: Under the influence of factors including unilateralism, protectionist trade measures, and expectations of tariffs against China, the yuan has depreciated against the dollar today, breaking through 7 yuan per dollar. The pound is under pressure again against the euro, trading near two-year lows at \u20ac1.0883, down 0.47%. Against the dollar, it is flat now at $1.2162. A closely-watched survey from IHS Markit showed an improvement in the UK\u2019s service industries in July, with the headline index reaching a nine-month high. However, services growth was largely wiped out by sharp declines in manufacturing and contraction and the all-sector purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) suggests the economy stagnated at the start of the third quarter. The all sector output index rose to 50.3 in July from 49.2 in June. (The 50 mark separates expansion from contraction.) In the eurozone, the picture was similar, with solid growth in the services sector and an accelerated decline in manufacturing production in July. The IHS Markit composite output index slipped to 51.5, \u2013 \u201ca level indicative of only modest growth and down from June\u2019s seven-month high of 52.2,\u201d it said. Germany is struggling and growth has also slowed in Spain. France performed best but even here the rate of expansion was well below trend. And here is our story on the weak UK new car sales figures for July. The British car market declined for a fifth consecutive month to deliver the weakest July sales in seven years, as the industry struggles with Brexit uncertainty and the backlash against diesel. In other corporate news, the historic Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic will enter administration today. My colleague Jasper Jolly writes: Harland and Wolff Heavy Industries, which traces its history to 1861, has struggled in recent years because of stiff competition from abroad. The company\u2019s Norwegian owner, Dolphin Drilling, filed for bankruptcy in June and put the Belfast shipyard up for sale. Here is our full story: BREAKING: HSBC has confirmed it is now planning to cut up to 2%, or 4,700 of its 237,685-strong global workforce. The job cuts are expected to hit senior staff the hardest, helping to reduce salary costs by as much as 4%, writes our banking correspondent Kalyeena Makortoff. However, the move is expected to bring full-year restructuring costs up to $700m (\u00a3576m). The lender said it had already spent $248m on severance following an unspecified number of job cuts in the first half of the year. The news came after the bank\u2019s boss John Flint stood down \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d. In Hong Kong, protests have entered their ninth week and escalated into city-wide strikes. Two cars have rammed protesters and police have been using teargas. You can read more on our Hong Kong live blog. Here is a picture gallery: To recap: last Friday, Trump tweeted that he planned to impose 10% tariffs on another $300bn worth of imports from China. His threat came even though renewed trade talks between Chinese and US officials in Shanghai ended on a seemingly positive note two days earlier, with both sides describing the talks as \u201cconstructive\u201d. In a statement today, China\u2019s central bank said that \u201ctrade protectionism and tariffs on Chinese goods\u201d caused the weakening of the yuan, after it let the Chinese currency fall through the 7 to the dollar level for the first time since 2008. Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, has looked at the global impact. Despite this breach of the 7 mark, we still don\u2019t expect Chinese policymakers to be comfortable with major weakening of the yuan. The concerns about triggering large financial capital outflows remain. Indeed, there are obvious tactical and time-specific considerations behind today\u2019s move. Further weakening of the yuan means that, globally, the pressure for the US dollar to strengthen is rising. This tends to be bad for the global economy. Moreover, the breaching of a previously defended important international benchmark, implies more uncertainty and variability on currency markets. Indeed, today other Asian currencies were also under pressure against the US dollar. Such dollar strength will be unwelcome in Washington DC. President Trump has openly complained about a strong dollar and has threatened to try to weaken the US dollar. If the US government were now to take action to weaken the US dollar, that would be bad news for economic policymakers in Europe and Japan. In both places, currency appreciation would be very unwelcome at a time that growth is already faltering. Back to the markets, where the share sell-off continues. Markets have taken fright after China\u2019s decision to let its currency fall through the crucial 7 to the dollar level for the first time since May 2008, in retaliation for Donald Trump\u2019s threat of further tariffs in the US-China trade war. The FTSE 100 index in London lost about 160 points, or 2.1%, at one stage. There are only two risers. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 151 points, or 2%, at 7,255 Germany\u2019s Dax down 1.36% at 11,710 France\u2019s CAC 40 down 2.1% at 5,246 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 1.26% at 8,785 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 1.25% at 20,783 Investors are piling into safe-haven assets, such as the Swiss franc, which has touched a new 25-month against the euro. A profit warning from Global Ports Holding, the world\u2019s biggest independent cruise port operator, demonstrates that trade wars and the weaker global outlook are having an impact. The company said cargo and container volumes had been weak while its cruise business had fared better. It now expects adjusted profits (Ebitda) to grow by low single digits in the first half, sending its shares down 8%. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, warns that despite the improvement in the July UK services PMI, activity is likely to remain under pressure for some time to come, with business investment set to fall further as Brexit uncertainty increases. When the UK releases its first estimate of second quarter growth on Friday, most of the focus will be on how much the stockpiling effect unwound after the inventory-building frenzy of the first quarter. Even when this noise is stripped out though, the underlying picture remains pretty lacklustre. Admittedly, the latest services PMI was a little better than hoped, at 51.4. This was partly driven by better flows of new orders from overseas, according to Markit/CIPS. But with Brexit uncertainty mounting, the fact that expectations for the year ahead dipped to the lowest level since March underlines the challenges facing the sector over coming months. He added: The latest PMI numbers are indicative of the economy stagnating at the start of the third quarter after indicating a 0.1% decline in the second quarter. Even growth in the service sector remains worryingly subdued, constrained by a marked fall in business services activity, where the rate of decline in July has been exceeded only once in the past ten years. The best performing sector was consumer services, highlighting how the economy remains dependent on consumer spending to avoid contraction. Taking the services, manufacturing and construction sectors together, the PMI all-sector output index rose to 50.3 in July from 49.2 in June, just above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. Manufacturing and construction both shrank last month. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the PMI surveys, said: The overall picture is one of an economy that is only just managing to skirt recession, with July\u2019s performance among the worst since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009. Growth in the UK\u2019s key services industries unexpectedly picked up in July, the closely-watched IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index suggests. The headline index rose to 51.4 from 50.2 in June, marking the highest level since October 2018. However, despite the improvement the PMI remains well below its long-running average of 54.9 and IHS Markit said the economy remains at risk of stagnation in the third quarter. The sell-off in UK and European shares has gathered pace. The FTSE 100 index in London has lost almost 2%, trading 145 points lower at 726.18. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.6%; France\u2019s CAC 40 has tumbled 1.88%; Spain\u2019s Ibex is 1.06% lower and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has shed 1.34%. The pound is close to two-year lows against the dollar and the euro. Against the euro, it has fallen 0.5% to \u20ac1.0881, and against the dollar it is off 0.3% at $1.2120. IHS Markit says: The most prominent encapsulation of these trends was seen in Germany, where a rapidly deteriorating manufacturing economy almost entirely offset ongoing robust growth of the service sector. Latest composite data showed Germany expanding at its slowest rate for over six years. Italy fared little better than Germany, despite growth improving slightly to a four-month high. Modest growth was seen in Spain, but nonetheless the weakest in nearly six years. France performed best, although even here the rate of expansion was relatively subdued and well below trend. Back to the eurozone. The IHS Markit composite monthly survey points to slowing economic growth, as the manufacturing downturn deepens. UK new car sales fell 4.1% year-on-year in July, marking the fifth month of decline, according to the industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Some 157,198 vehicles left showrooms last month, the lowest July total since 2012. The German readings are weak. The French services PMI remains pretty strong at 52.6, but when combined with the shrinking manufacturing sector, the composite report points to weaker economic growth. Over here, the closely-watched services and composite PMI surveys are coming out, starting with Italy. The composite reports pull the services and manufacturing indices together. Investors are seeking refuge in Treasury bonds, gold and the Japanese yen, as the trade dispute between the US and China continues and the Chinese currency\u2019s drop ricocheted through global markets. The FTSE 100 is now down more than 100 points at 7,305, a 1.37% fall. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at the currency broker FXTM, discusses if the trade war is shifting to a currency war. China still has a few tools to respond to the latest US tariffs, whether it\u2019s through halting imports of American agricultural products, prohibiting exports of rare-earth materials, stopping the purchase of US debt, or further increasing tariffs on US goods. However, none of these tactics are enough to offset the impact of the additional tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods. He asks if currency is the new option. The Renminbi broke above 7 per US dollar this morning after the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) set the midpoint at 6.9225. This is the first time since May 2008 that the Chinese currency trades above the key psychological level of 7. The PBoC has spent hundreds of billions of dollars over the past couple of years to prevent their currency from breaching this key level, but now that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. In fact, the currency tool may be very effective as it significantly offsets the impact of US tariffs. If the Chinese currency falls by another 8% from the current level, the 10% tariffs paid by US importers will be offset by the Renminbi\u2019s weakness. While currency depreciation also has a negative effect such as the risk of capital outflow, as long as the decline is orderly, volatility is contained, and speculation activities are controlled, the risks will be minimized. No one knows when this trade war will end, but it is becoming more likely that it will be after the US 2020 elections. We don\u2019t think that this trade war will do any good to President Trump in the upcoming election, especially given the several swing states that are already hurt by the current trade dispute. The German and UK stock markets opened more than 1% lower on Monday, continuing the slump from Asia overnight as traders fret about what US dollar rising above 7 against the Chinese yuan means for the economy and trade war. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst UK and EMEA at trading platform Oanda, says: This level has been protected for a long time by the Chinese who fear the consequences of rapid capital outflows and have spent large amounts of reserves to keep the currency just below. It seems they\u2019re now prepared to relax this policy after the US ramped up the trade war last week, slapping a 10% tariff on $300bn of imports from the start of next month. This unintended consequence of the new tariffs will undoubtedly infuriate Trump who has accused China of currency manipulation in the past, even though this is effectively a case of them manipulating it less as market pressures grow. The timing of the move will spark speculation that this is being done intentionally as a counter-measure against US tariffs, which could cool relations further and make negotiations that much tougher. We now await Trump\u2019s response which I imagine will come via Twitter shortly. European stock markets are also in the red. Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.9% France\u2019s CAC 40 down 1% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.8% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.8% In London, the FTSE 100 index has opened more than 1% lower, trading nearly 80 points lower at 7330.47. Sterling is also tumbling, and has lost 0.4% against both the dollar and the euro. It is threatening to go below $1.21 again. The market turmoil in Asia led Japanese officials from the finance ministry, central bank and financial regulator to hold a meeting, to discuss the worrying moves in financial markets. The yen jumped to a seven-month high against the US dollar on Monday, as investors piled into safe-haven assets, spooked by escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sank 2.5% to the lowest levels since late January. Ray Attrill, head of currency strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney, told Reuters: Everything is selling off right now. We have no reason to expect any cessation in selling unless we see any strong action to defend any yuan weakness. Our working assumption is that we are unlikely to see any meaningful resolution to the trade dispute anytime soon. The panic is expected to spread to Europe and Wall Street. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The yuan has sunk more than 1% to 11-year lows on mounting fears of an escalation in the US-China trade war. It broke through the 7 to the dollar mark for the first time since the height of the financial crisis in 2008. My colleague Martin Farrer in Sydney writes: The simmering trade tensions between the United States and China have threatened to spark a full-blown currency war after Beijing allowed the yuan to drop below a level it had previously defended with sustained vigour. China\u2019s central bank allowed the yuan to sink below the sensitive seven-to-one dollar level for the first time since 2008 in what one expert called a \u201cweaponisation\u201d of the currency. Global shares tumbled on Friday after Donald Trump ramped up the US-China trade war. In a series of tweets, he threatened to impose a 10% tariff on the $300bn worth of remaining Chinese goods not yet impacted by American border taxes, by September. The sell-off continued on Monday in Asia, where stock markets were also rattled by protests in Hong Kong, which have entered their ninth week. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng is down 2.89% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei has lost 1.74%, falling to its lowest level since early June. Australian shares fell 2% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi sank 2.6% to its lowest level since November 2016. Protesters have begun a city-wide strike \u2013 Hong Kong has not held a general strike in more than 50 years. During the morning rush hour for commuters, protesters caused transport across Hong Kong to be brought to a standstill, blocking roads and trains. You can follow all the latest developments on our Hong Kong live blog. Are we going to see more August angst? asks Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. The big question is whether last week\u2019s sell-off is a one-off and a buying opportunity, or the start of a much bigger decline. Judging by the ferocity of the last two day\u2019s sell-off and today\u2019s further declines in Asia, there is a sense that it might be the latter which means we look set to see some further August angst for investors, starting with today\u2019s session in Asia, which has seen further heavy falls and is set to see European markets open sharply lower this morning.

I just love them. Also, I pilfered Tom Sawyer from my late father\u2019s library (all right, I\u2019ll take it back, my mom won\u2019t even know that I took it...) \u2013 it\u2019s a masterful Serbian translation from the 1949 (the author is Stanislav Vinaver). It\u2019s relatively rare to find a translation that\u2019s as good as the original, but this one really is, and I just have to revisit it every so often.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4548062\">BaddHamster</a> is \u201cfinishing up\u201d The House Of Sleep by Jonathan Coe:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Warm, funny, breezily paced (as always with him) and a few interesting thoughts on the nature of sleep. Basically, if you like Coe, you\u2019ll probably enjoy it. I do and I am.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1471669\">CharlieBing</a> \u201cjust finished\u201d Judith Schalansky\u2019s Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a cartographer by training and a sometime graphic artist by trade, I just loved almost every bit of this beautifully designed book ... a minor quibble with the occasional use of yellow text on white pages, but the typography is exquisite, the whole conceit just wonderful.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve good words to say about Kill [redacted] by Anthony Good,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Michael, a retired headmaster grieving for his wife, the victim of a terrorist attack, asks himself the question of who is really responsible for what happened, not the bombers themselves, not the bomb makers, but the \u2018bomb-triggerers\u2019 \u2013 the politician enriching himself from his time in office. There\u2019s much more to this story than vengeance though; the narration soon reveals darker aspects of Michael\u2019s character as he recalls his career. Good\u2019s skill is in the narrator considering himself as a realist struggling with difficult pupils, but coming over to the reader as anything but that, and a cruel authoritarian.</p> <p>As an ex-teacher of 31 years, this is an admirably accurate portrayal of some headteacher\u2019s traits I have seen all too frequently.</p> </blockquote> <p>Reading Isabel Allende\u2019s Daughter Of Fortune has been \u201can exquisite pleasure\u201d for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12168095\">PatLux</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Such a rich historical novel in which I, like one of the main protagonists Tao Chi\u2019en, learned lots. I loved the lyrical evocative prose which stimulated all my senses. One of those books that makes you feel you are on a delightful journey with the characters and evokes laughter and sadness. And it stays with you in the intervals between when you put it down and pick it up again. I will definitely be reading more Allende.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100105930\">MachenBach </a>recommends Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A satirical mock-autobiography, published anonymously by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford in 1924. Anthony Burgess singled it out as one of the 20th century\u2019s funniest books, but I would say that it\u2019s consistently amusing, rather than LOL funny. Still, that\u2019s rare enough to be noteworthy. Carp is possessed of a Pooterishly inflated sense of his own (and his father\u2019s) importance, and almost total blindness to his own limitations and motivations.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. \u201cIt\u2019s Mark Twain these days,\u201d says voicefrombelgrade, \u201cI\u2019m rereading his short story collection\u201d: Every time I read The Experience Of The McWilliamses With Membranous Croup, Extracts from Adam\u2019s Diary, Eve\u2019s Diary, The Stolen White Elephant... I just love them. Also, I pilfered Tom Sawyer from my late father\u2019s library (all right, I\u2019ll take it back, my mom won\u2019t even know that I took it...) \u2013 it\u2019s a masterful Serbian translation from the 1949 (the author is Stanislav Vinaver). It\u2019s relatively rare to find a translation that\u2019s as good as the original, but this one really is, and I just have to revisit it every so often. BaddHamster is \u201cfinishing up\u201d The House Of Sleep by Jonathan Coe: Warm, funny, breezily paced (as always with him) and a few interesting thoughts on the nature of sleep. Basically, if you like Coe, you\u2019ll probably enjoy it. I do and I am. And CharlieBing \u201cjust finished\u201d Judith Schalansky\u2019s Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands: As a cartographer by training and a sometime graphic artist by trade, I just loved almost every bit of this beautifully designed book ... a minor quibble with the occasional use of yellow text on white pages, but the typography is exquisite, the whole conceit just wonderful. \u201cI\u2019ve good words to say about Kill [redacted] by Anthony Good,\u201d says safereturndoubtful: Michael, a retired headmaster grieving for his wife, the victim of a terrorist attack, asks himself the question of who is really responsible for what happened, not the bombers themselves, not the bomb makers, but the \u2018bomb-triggerers\u2019 \u2013 the politician enriching himself from his time in office. There\u2019s much more to this story than vengeance though; the narration soon reveals darker aspects of Michael\u2019s character as he recalls his career. Good\u2019s skill is in the narrator considering himself as a realist struggling with difficult pupils, but coming over to the reader as anything but that, and a cruel authoritarian. As an ex-teacher of 31 years, this is an admirably accurate portrayal of some headteacher\u2019s traits I have seen all too frequently. Reading Isabel Allende\u2019s Daughter Of Fortune has been \u201can exquisite pleasure\u201d for PatLux: Such a rich historical novel in which I, like one of the main protagonists Tao Chi\u2019en, learned lots. I loved the lyrical evocative prose which stimulated all my senses. One of those books that makes you feel you are on a delightful journey with the characters and evokes laughter and sadness. And it stays with you in the intervals between when you put it down and pick it up again. I will definitely be reading more Allende. MachenBach recommends Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man: A satirical mock-autobiography, published anonymously by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford in 1924. Anthony Burgess singled it out as one of the 20th century\u2019s funniest books, but I would say that it\u2019s consistently amusing, rather than LOL funny. Still, that\u2019s rare enough to be noteworthy. Carp is possessed of a Pooterishly inflated sense of his own (and his father\u2019s) importance, and almost total blindness to his own limitations and motivations. He\u2019s a hilariously sanctimonious self-professed Christian (or \u201cXtian\u201d), who frequently goes out into the streets to lecture smokers, drinkers and music hall artistes on the evils of their ways, but who seems hypocritically blind to his own acts of bullying, blackmail, and greed. Like a monstrous cross between Pooter and Ignatius J Reilly, his voice is impressively realised, and the irony well sustained. I\u2019m not sure how much real satirical bite it had at the time \u2013 it seems rather more 1890s than 1920s in many ways, and the joke does wear a little thin long before he gets his comeuppance, but it\u2019s very well-written (in a pretentiously archaic register) and generally good fun. Finally, Dennis89 suggests we give \u201cserious thought\u201d to reading An Armenian Sketchbook by Vasily Grossman: A 200-page account detailing the writer\u2019s reflections, thoughts and wanderings during his visit to Armenia at the twilight of his life. Justification for the journey is provided by the task of editing a Russian translation of a local Armenian novel though the trip allows Grossman to explore and delve far more deeply into this marginalised and often overlooked country. Faith, patriotism, oppression, comradeship and other such topics are beautifully mused upon in this life-affirming gem of a book. Sounds fantastic. (That\u2019s also an excellent excuse to link to Linda Grant\u2019s fine article on reading Grossman: \u201cIt took me three weeks to read it and three weeks to recover from the experience.\u201d) Interesting links about books and reading What moves Nina Stibbe most in a book? \u201cDogs.\u201d \u201cThis is an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact.\u201d Not all early reviewers of Moby Dick were impressed. Was John Steinbeck a spy? Olga Tokarczuk speaks out on nationalism. An interview with Ann Goldstein on translating Primo Levi\u2019s work. (Hat tip to Carmen212.) Maurice Sendak at the opera.

Tesco will also reduce opening hours in 134 of its 1,750 smaller neighbourhood Express stores, where footfall is lower. Jason Tarry, the supermarket\u2019s UK and Ireland boss, said: \u201cIn a challenging, evolving retail environment, with increasing cost pressures, we have to continue to review the way we run our stores to ensure we reflect the way our customers are shopping and do so in the most efficient way. \u201cWe do not take any decision which impacts colleagues lightly, but have to make sure we remain relevant for customers and operate a sustainable business now and in the future.\u201d The retailer, which has more than 300,000 UK employees and more than 3,400 stores, said earlier this year it could cut 9,000 jobs, although it hoped to redeploy up to half into other customer service roles. Fishmonger, butcher and baker jobs at the retailer were expected to be at risk, along with counter staff. The cuts at Tesco are part of plans by the chief executive, Dave Lewis, to slash \u00a31.5bn from Tesco\u2019s cost base. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business minister, said: \u201cThese job cuts add to the growing tally over the last 18 months. Hundreds of thousands of jobs and our communities rely on our high streets but the Tories are allowing them to be hollowed out. \u201cThe government must urgently act to save Britain\u2019s high streets and prevent even more jobs being lost.\u201d She said Labour would breathe new life into the high street with five policies including free bus travel for under-25s on improved bus services, free public wifi in town centres, measures to end ATM charges and stem bank and Post Office closures. She also promised annual revaluations of business rates and registers of landlords who own empty shops.",

Come to San Francisco to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/04/liverpool-manchester-city-community-shield-match-report\" title=\"\">the Community Shield</a> and, in my case, come on the last day of a family holiday to California, at the start of which I vowed to my wife this would be a football-free trip for us and our daughter. Turns out I lied.</p> <p>In my defence, I had done a pretty good job of keeping football out of our lives while on this side of the Atlantic. We arrived on the previous Sunday and, since then, there had been little checking of pre-season scores or obsessing over transfer news. But the Community Shield, well that was different. Not an important game but definitely a more important game than the other not important games, and particularly so if your team are playing in it for the first time in 13 years. That\u2019s right, Liverpool were back at Wembley to compete for English football\u2019s curtain-raising silver octagon and even from 5,000 miles away, I simply had to watch it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/04/manchester-city-liverpool-rivalry-community-shield\">Recovery shows Liverpool remain chief threat to City\u2019s home hegemony | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What that entailed was something I hadn\u2019t previously experienced in more than three decades of being a Liverpool fan: waking up in darkness, jumping into a taxi and rushing over to a bar in order to make a 7am kick-off. But that\u2019s what I found myself doing on the Sunday just gone. Out of our hotel near Union Square and towards the Kezar Pub in Cole Valley. Hippy and hipster country and the place Jimi Hendrix once called home.</p> <p>It was hard to get a sense of that as my ride pulled up outside the Kezar. San Francisco is known for its fog and this was proving to be a particularly foggy morning. Thick mist hung over Stanyan Street, covering most of the surroundings but thankfully not the place I was meant to be.</p> <p>I found out about the Kezar on the Twitter page of San Francisco\u2019s official Liverpool supporters club and was told, via a direct message from the club secretary Aman Parikh, that I was more than welcome to join members at what is their regular hangout for Sunday\u2019s game. Parikh wouldn\u2019t be there himself but, he assured me, other friendly faces would be.</p> <p>So that was the plan, and it allowed me to not only watch Liverpool versus Manchester City at Wembley but also explore something that had fascinated me for some time \u2013 the experience of being a Red on foreign shores. The distance, the time difference, the general sense of isolation; was it really worth the hassle and commitment?</p> <p>Overseas supporters certainly come across as a unique bunch. One only has to observe the levels they go to in order to stay in touch with their respective teams for proof of that, as well as the subsequent ways that affects how they react to results. It can be extreme \u2013 wins are seen as the start of something big while defeats are very much the end of the world.

      "bodyText": "Come all ye faithful. Come to San Francisco. Come to San Francisco to watch the Community Shield and, in my case, come on the last day of a family holiday to California, at the start of which I vowed to my wife this would be a football-free trip for us and our daughter. Turns out I lied. In my defence, I had done a pretty good job of keeping football out of our lives while on this side of the Atlantic. We arrived on the previous Sunday and, since then, there had been little checking of pre-season scores or obsessing over transfer news. But the Community Shield, well that was different. Not an important game but definitely a more important game than the other not important games, and particularly so if your team are playing in it for the first time in 13 years. That\u2019s right, Liverpool were back at Wembley to compete for English football\u2019s curtain-raising silver octagon and even from 5,000 miles away, I simply had to watch it. What that entailed was something I hadn\u2019t previously experienced in more than three decades of being a Liverpool fan: waking up in darkness, jumping into a taxi and rushing over to a bar in order to make a 7am kick-off. But that\u2019s what I found myself doing on the Sunday just gone. Out of our hotel near Union Square and towards the Kezar Pub in Cole Valley. Hippy and hipster country and the place Jimi Hendrix once called home. It was hard to get a sense of that as my ride pulled up outside the Kezar. San Francisco is known for its fog and this was proving to be a particularly foggy morning. Thick mist hung over Stanyan Street, covering most of the surroundings but thankfully not the place I was meant to be. I found out about the Kezar on the Twitter page of San Francisco\u2019s official Liverpool supporters club and was told, via a direct message from the club secretary Aman Parikh, that I was more than welcome to join members at what is their regular hangout for Sunday\u2019s game. Parikh wouldn\u2019t be there himself but, he assured me, other friendly faces would be. So that was the plan, and it allowed me to not only watch Liverpool versus Manchester City at Wembley but also explore something that had fascinated me for some time \u2013 the experience of being a Red on foreign shores. The distance, the time difference, the general sense of isolation; was it really worth the hassle and commitment? Overseas supporters certainly come across as a unique bunch. One only has to observe the levels they go to in order to stay in touch with their respective teams for proof of that, as well as the subsequent ways that affects how they react to results. It can be extreme \u2013 wins are seen as the start of something big while defeats are very much the end of the world. Not always but definitely in some cases, and discussing this with a friend back in England some years ago he espoused an interesting theory as to why this might be. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d he said, \u201cmost overseas fans watch football on their own \u2013 on their laptop or whatever \u2013 so for them it\u2019s a very personal experience. As such, they take results personally.\u201d It\u2019s a train of thought that perhaps explains why so many overseas supporters club have sprung up. There are almost 60 officially affiliated to Liverpool in North America alone, with branches in New York, Washington and Madison, the later created by Bryn Griffiths, the Woking-born son of Liverpudlians who also organised Chicago\u2019s official branch while living there. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown steadily and have hundreds of members who fill our bar \u2013 the Nomad World Pub Madison,\u201d Griffiths says, and it\u2019s obvious that for members of overseas supporters clubs, in the US and elsewhere, the importance of them is not only in their establishment of a place to watch games but also in the collective sense of identity that they foster.

      "bodyText": "UK shale gas company Cuadrilla will ask for extra time to drill for shale gas at its Lancashire fracking site after its November deadline. Within the next month the fracking pioneer will ask Lancashire county council for permission to continue its drilling campaign until at least the spring of 2021. The company restarted work at the Preston New Road site only last month in an 11th-hour bid before its licence expires in November. Francis Egan, the chief executive of Cuadrilla, said the company will ask to tweak the licence terms to allow for more time following months of delays to its drilling campaign. He said the application would not seek to change the scope of its work or the requirement for the site to be shut down and restored by April 2023. The company has made slow progress because existing rules mean frackers must halt all work if their activities cause an earth tremor which registers a magnitude of 0.5 or higher. Cuadrilla is the only shale gas company to undertake fracking in the UK, but has been able to frack only one of the four wells it had hoped to drill. Egan said that by the end of its 30-month licence Cuadrilla will have undertaken only 21 months worth of work after being forced to stop work on multiple occasions. The rules have been heavily criticised by Egan and other shale companies because seismic activity at this level is common when fracturing the Earth\u2019s shale layers to release gas. Egan has said that a commercial shale gas industry will be impossible in the UK without a change to the rules. Natascha Engel stepped down as the UK\u2019s first shale gas commissioner after only six months in April, blaming the \u201cridiculous\u201d regulations for hobbling the industry. Cuadrilla hopes the results of its work could make a case for the UK\u2019s controversial shale gas ambitions and convince regulators to ease the earth tremor limits. Frackers also face an uphill battle in the UK due to strong public opposition to shale gas and fierce protest from environmental groups. Last week the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called on the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to ban fracking over fears it may stop the UK meeting its climate targets. Research commissioned by the opposition party found that exploiting the UK\u2019s shale gas reserves would release enough greenhouse gas emissions to eliminate any hope of the government meeting its 2050 net zero target. Cuadrilla said in a statement that shale gas could replace the UK\u2019s existing gas imports meaning it would not lead to extra emissions.",

By the end of this humane and heart-rending show, they will have forced their way through the roof of the container \u2013 literally thinking outside the box. \u201cTo be unregulated is to be dangerous,\u201d they say.</p> <p>The impetus for the show, and the reason they have called an audience member on stage to help them make a burger, was an incident in 2016 when an unknown assailant threw a burger at them in a transphobic attack. Like <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/edinburgh-fringe-festival-2018-dressed-show-metoo-lydia-higginson-a8471581.html\">Lydia Higginson in Dressed</a>, who turned to making her own wardrobe in response to being sexually assaulted, Alabanza tries to reconcile themselves with this random (yet commonplace) act of violence, by taking control of the offending weapon.</p> <p>Like claiming a term of abuse and making it a badge of pride, there could, perhaps, be something empowering about learning the thickness of the bap, the spiciness of the meat and the size of the container. They think it\u2019s worth a try if only to dispel the memory of a meaningless attack.</p> <p>Much of this is very funny. Although fragile, Alabanza is sassy and witty, feeding off the audience like a seasoned cabaret star and riding the unpredictability of the interactive format. They generate roars of laughter, but the angry and intelligent script is also underscored with the real pain of exclusion, of being boxed in, of being trapped in a world where sexual and racial violence is prevalent and, too often, tolerated.</p> <p>For all the fun and games of early morning drinks and hamfisted onion chopping, there is little to be gained from mastering the burger. The threat of being pointed at, heckled and assaulted remains. So they go from fast-food poetry to Crackerjack cookery and on to great tirades of confrontational fury, pleading for a society in which marginalised people don\u2019t have to go on stage to let their voices be heard and where passersby do not simply pass by when someone\u2019s human dignity is denied.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/burgerz\">Traverse, Edinburgh</a>, until 25 August. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2019+tone/reviews\">Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews </a></p>",

By the end of this humane and heart-rending show, they will have forced their way through the roof of the container \u2013 literally thinking outside the box. \u201cTo be unregulated is to be dangerous,\u201d they say. The impetus for the show, and the reason they have called an audience member on stage to help them make a burger, was an incident in 2016 when an unknown assailant threw a burger at them in a transphobic attack. Like Lydia Higginson in Dressed, who turned to making her own wardrobe in response to being sexually assaulted, Alabanza tries to reconcile themselves with this random (yet commonplace) act of violence, by taking control of the offending weapon. Like claiming a term of abuse and making it a badge of pride, there could, perhaps, be something empowering about learning the thickness of the bap, the spiciness of the meat and the size of the container. They think it\u2019s worth a try if only to dispel the memory of a meaningless attack. Much of this is very funny. Although fragile, Alabanza is sassy and witty, feeding off the audience like a seasoned cabaret star and riding the unpredictability of the interactive format. They generate roars of laughter, but the angry and intelligent script is also underscored with the real pain of exclusion, of being boxed in, of being trapped in a world where sexual and racial violence is prevalent and, too often, tolerated. For all the fun and games of early morning drinks and hamfisted onion chopping, there is little to be gained from mastering the burger. The threat of being pointed at, heckled and assaulted remains. So they go from fast-food poetry to Crackerjack cookery and on to great tirades of confrontational fury, pleading for a society in which marginalised people don\u2019t have to go on stage to let their voices be heard and where passersby do not simply pass by when someone\u2019s human dignity is denied. \u2022 At Traverse, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a sometimes confusing series of exchanges with the media, Johnson\u2019s spokesman refused at least 10 times to outline whether this deadline could be changed by the actions of MPs, saying he could not comment on theoretical situations.</p> \n<p>Asked if Johnson would respect a no-confidence vote against his government were one passed, he said: \u201cOne hasn\u2019t been called, and one hasn\u2019t been held, and I have never discussed hypotheticals.

Quizzed repeatedly at a media briefing, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman also declined to say whether the government would consider allowing no deal to happen if it were amid an election campaign, or if Johnson lost a no-confidence vote in the Commons. The spokesman said he could not comment on hypothetical situations. But asked whether, as a matter of broader principle, Johnson could commit to respecting votes in parliament, he also declined to answer. He pointed out that a no-deal departure was simply the consequence of legislation as it stood: \u201cThe legal default, as put in place by parliament, is that the UK will leave on 31 October, with or without a deal.\u201d The comments, which indicate a further ratcheting up of the new government\u2019s rhetoric on no deal, began when the spokesman was asked whether it now appeared to be too late for the UK to depart with a new agreement. Johnson currently has no Brexit talks scheduled with European leaders, having set down the unilateral condition that the EU must first ditch the backstop insurance clause for the Irish border, something Brussels has long insisted is impossible. The spokesman said: \u201cIt is my job to set out the PM\u2019s position, and that is that the UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October whatever the circumstances. There are no ifs or buts. \u201cWe must restore trust in our democracy and fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people by coming out of the EU on 31 October. Politicians cannot choose which votes to respect. They promised to respect the referendum result.

The spokesman similarly declined to say whether a Johnson government had a general policy of abiding by votes of parliament, saying: \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is not engaging in some hypothetical game you\u2019re trying to pull me into.\u201d Having repeatedly declined to comment, the spokesman then rejected the idea it was fair to say the government was not ruling out ignoring the will of parliament, saying: \u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t be a fair characterisation.

Every week, it seems, a chunk of the Labour parliamentary party change their minds about how they\u2019re going to avoid campaigning for Corbyn at the next election. From now until the Labour party conference, they will distractedly expend their energies avoiding deselection. They are wasting their efforts. And they are wasting the country\u2019s time. The window to jump ship \u2013 whether to the resurgent Liberal Democrats, to a new centre party, or to some electoral combination of the two \u2013 is closing rapidly. Corbyn is not going to be ousted as leader of the Labour party before 31 October; Momentum and Unite are not going to suddenly lose hold of the factional national executive committee (NEC); Tom Watson, wounded by his support for the fantasist Carl Beech, is not going to be in a position to wrest control of the Labour party. Corbyn\u2019s outriders may worry about a media smear campaign against their man, but they can rest assured that no newspaper editor is likely to throw their weight behind Watson, a man defined on Fleet Street by his lifelong crusade to impose content regulation on the press. It\u2019s hard to leave a party in Britain, let alone found a new one. Those of us who burned political relationships to speak about sexual harassment in Westminster know that better than anyone. But sometimes, it\u2019s necessary. Change UK jumped too soon, and the social democratic cavalry failed to ride in to their rescue \u2013 but there was something joyous in seeing MPs such as Heidi Allen and Luciana Berger liberated to speak their minds about their former bosses. Privately, senior staffers around both leaderships speak of their amazement that moderate MPs have waited this long to split. The hard left\u2019s Praetorian guard mocks moderate Labour much as the Tory hard right mocks its moderates: as \u201cwet\u201d in both content and character. Until moderates finally show some mettle, they will deserve it. Where Labour moderates lead, Tory waverers may take longer to follow. The reconfiguration in British politics goes far deeper than Brexit \u2013 and any new party would be foolish to brand itself as a continuity remain organisation, as Change UK did to its fatal cost. But dissident Tories will have more political cover to take a stand if and when Johnson finally declares for a no-deal Brexit. Plenty are already indicating their horror at a Johnson-Corbyn world. Phillip Lee, a man of great principle but traditionally wet vacillation, has announced he will take the summer to consider whether to join the Lib Dems; a move which would wipe out Johnson\u2019s majority. By the end of the summer, however, it will be too late for Lee and it will be too late for Labour\u2019s dissidents. No one can run a general election campaign without knowing three months before polling day which rosette they\u2019ll be wearing. It\u2019s make-up-your-mind time, folks. \u2022 Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and culture",

Ngwevu lived in a world of ferns, horsetails and conifers watered by a few large permanent rivers. Of all the predators it had to watch out for, the carnivore <em>Dracovenator</em> probably came top.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a dinosaur that\u2019s been hiding in plain sight,\u201d Barrett said of Ngwevu. \u201cWe recognised it by going back through museum collections and doing detailed comparisons between the available specimens. It makes the point that museum collections, even those that are heavily studied, often have the potential to surprise us with finds of brand new species.\u201d</p>",

The fossilised bones had been misidentified as a peculiar specimen of Massospondylus, one of the first named dinosaurs. But a detailed analysis of the 200m-year-old skeleton, which includes an almost complete skull, led researchers to conclude that the remains not only represented a new species but belonged to an entirely new genus too. Named Ngwevu intloko, which is Xhosa for \u201cgrey skull\u201d, the creature measured about 4m from the tip of its snout to the end of its tail and may have weighed as much as 300kg (660lb). It walked on its hind legs and had a barrel-shaped body, a long, slender neck and a small, boxy skull. Though predominantly a plant-eater, Ngwevu may have taken small animals too when the opportunity arose.

Details of the discovery are published in the journal PeerJ. The near-complete fossil was collected from a farm in the Fouriesburg area in Free State, South Africa, in 1978 and has been in the collection at the Evolutionary Studies Institute (ESI), part of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, ever since. \u201cA few of us harboured suspicions that it might be something new and different,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cIn particular, the skull of Ngwevu is much broader and boxier than that of Massospondylus, which is much narrower and taller in proportions.\u201d Because Massospondylus was so common in South Africa, the researchers had a number of specimens of different ages with which to compare the Ngwevu bones. \u201cBased on this, we were able to rule out age as a possible explanation for the differences we see,\u201d Chapelle said. The dinosaur appears to have been fully grown when it died at about 10 years old, and was smaller than the 5m to 6m-long adult Massospondylus. Ngwevu belonged to a diverse population of early dinosaurs that were related to the massive plant-eating sauropods such as diplodocus. Ngwevu lived in a world of ferns, horsetails and conifers watered by a few large permanent rivers. Of all the predators it had to watch out for, the carnivore Dracovenator probably came top. \u201cThis is a dinosaur that\u2019s been hiding in plain sight,\u201d Barrett said of Ngwevu. \u201cWe recognised it by going back through museum collections and doing detailed comparisons between the available specimens. It makes the point that museum collections, even those that are heavily studied, often have the potential to surprise us with finds of brand new species.\u201d",

The state broadcaster SVT reported that applications for eight permits had been filed in Eskilstuna over the weekend, while three EU citizens begging in the town centre without a licence were informed of the new law by police and moved on.

      "bodyText": "David Whitlock has not showered or bathed for 15 years, yet he does not have body odour. \u201cIt was kind of strange for the first few months, but after that I stopped missing it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I get a specific part of my body dirty, then I\u2019ll wash that specific part\u201d \u2013 but never with soap. As well as germs, soap gets rid of the skin\u2019s protective oils and alters its pH level. Although Whitlock appreciated gaining an extra 15 minutes a day from soap-dodging, his primary motivation was to encourage friendly microbes to live on him in symbiotic harmony. The bacteria get to feast on the ammonia from his sweat and he gets low-maintenance, balanced skin. Just as awareness of the importance of the gut microbiome has led to a boom in probiotic and fermented foods and supplements, there is increasing interest in our skin microbiome: the trillions of microbes that protect us from pathogens and keep us healthy by making vitamins and other useful chemicals. In this unprecedentedly sanitised era, in which eczema, acne and problems associated with dry skin are rife, consumers are hungry for solutions. Even the mainstream brand Dove claims vaguely that its products are \u201cmicrobiome-gentle\u201d. Sarah Ballantyne, a medical biophysicist turned author and lifestyle guru known as the Paleo Mom, has been an advocate of living in a more \u201cstone age\u201d way since reaching a healthy weight after adopting the Paleo diet.

The deal is set to be announced in the next 48 hours. Jo\u00e3o Cancelo joined Juventus from Valencia last summer and played 25 Serie A games as the club won the Scudetto in 2018-19. He will sign a five-year deal at City. The full-back will be City\u2019s second major summer signing after the arrival of Rodri from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for \u00a362.6m. They have also recruited Angeli\u00f1o from PSV Eindhoven for \u00a35.3m. City beat Liverpool on penalties on Sunday to win the Community Shield and afterwards Guardiola spoke of another defender, Harry Maguire, who is set to join Manchester United this week. \u201cMaguire is an excellent, top-class player,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were interested but we could not afford him. United could afford him. He\u2019s strong in the air, good with the ball, he can drive with the ball and he\u2019s so fast. He has a lot of qualities, so congratulations to United.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This play, first performed in Sydney in 2013, has been called a classic of Australian theatre.</p> <p>The big question was whether Andrew Bovell\u2019s adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jan/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview22\">Kate Grenville\u2019s historical novel</a> about the collision between white settlers and Indigenous Australians would excite the same response outside Australia. Judging by the reaction of the Edinburgh audience, it undoubtedly will, since Bovell\u2019s play and Neil Armfield\u2019s production combine masterly storytelling with metaphorical resonance.</p> <p>Everything that happens over the play\u2019s almost three hours springs from a prologue. First we see an Indigenous family seated round a campfire expressing their fear that the strangers they have sighted will bring change. Then we see William Thornhill, a transported convict, telling his wife, Sal, and their two children, that he is abandoning his career as a boat man. Instead, he will become a farmer on 100 acres of land he has found on the Hawkesbury river. When Sal asks about the people already there, William blithely replies: \u201cThey\u2019re not like us. They keep moving. They don\u2019t dig down into a place. They just move across it.\u201d We see the fatal consequences of his error over a 10-month period in 1813-14. Unfolding at an unhurried pace, Bovell\u2019s script shows how the Dharug people, to whom the land originally belonged, are variously viewed as a threat and a curiosity. One white settler is all for repelling them with violence, another secretly lives with his Dharug partner and child while William\u2019s young sons form a playful bond with their Indigenous mates. There are even moments when some form of accord seems possible but behind the story lies a dispute over land. William has built huts and planted corn on the Dharug\u2019s fertile yam ground and this leads to a shattering conclusion in which force prevails and he turns from an immigrant farmer into a reluctant oppressor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ce33814ff68b96672a65d77ec009263176e25c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ce33814ff68b96672a65d77ec009263176e25c3/0_223_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The power of home ... The Secret River.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The power of home ... The Secret River.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are many layers to this mesmerising story. One is to do with the power of home: the mourning song of the Dharugs about their native land is ironically juxtaposed with Sal singing an English nursery rhyme and reminding us that her roots are firmly in London. Iain Grandage\u2019s music is an essential part of Armfield\u2019s production about which I have only one complaint. Having entrusted the story\u2019s narration to the powerful figure of Ningali Lawford Wolf, it seems a pity that so many of her words are obscured by the score.</p> <p>Otherwise everything is ideal. Nathaniel Dean as William suggests a decent, hardworking man trapped by a mixture of ignorance and condescension while Georgia Adamson, as his wife, displays a far superior awareness of historical reality. There is outstanding support from Jeremy Sims as a brutish white settler, Melissa Jaffer as a sage, pipe-smoking elder and from Major \u201cMoogy\u201d Sumner as a white-bearded Dharug veteran.</p> <p>Armfield also stages the play with an admirable clarity aided by superb lighting from Mark Howett that captures Australia\u2019s ochre sunsets. It is a work that takes its time but memorably and movingly pinpoints a crucial moment in Australian history, while suggesting that we are witnessing a reenactment of an unending colonial tragedy.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/whats-on/2019/secretriver\">King\u2019s theatre, Edinburgh</a>, until 11 August and at the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-secret-river\">National Theatre, London</a>, from 22 August to 7 September.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2019+tone/reviews\">Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "This play, first performed in Sydney in 2013, has been called a classic of Australian theatre. The big question was whether Andrew Bovell\u2019s adaptation of Kate Grenville\u2019s historical novel about the collision between white settlers and Indigenous Australians would excite the same response outside Australia. Judging by the reaction of the Edinburgh audience, it undoubtedly will, since Bovell\u2019s play and Neil Armfield\u2019s production combine masterly storytelling with metaphorical resonance. Everything that happens over the play\u2019s almost three hours springs from a prologue. First we see an Indigenous family seated round a campfire expressing their fear that the strangers they have sighted will bring change. Then we see William Thornhill, a transported convict, telling his wife, Sal, and their two children, that he is abandoning his career as a boat man. Instead, he will become a farmer on 100 acres of land he has found on the Hawkesbury river. When Sal asks about the people already there, William blithely replies: \u201cThey\u2019re not like us. They keep moving. They don\u2019t dig down into a place. They just move across it.\u201d We see the fatal consequences of his error over a 10-month period in 1813-14. Unfolding at an unhurried pace, Bovell\u2019s script shows how the Dharug people, to whom the land originally belonged, are variously viewed as a threat and a curiosity. One white settler is all for repelling them with violence, another secretly lives with his Dharug partner and child while William\u2019s young sons form a playful bond with their Indigenous mates. There are even moments when some form of accord seems possible but behind the story lies a dispute over land. William has built huts and planted corn on the Dharug\u2019s fertile yam ground and this leads to a shattering conclusion in which force prevails and he turns from an immigrant farmer into a reluctant oppressor. There are many layers to this mesmerising story. One is to do with the power of home: the mourning song of the Dharugs about their native land is ironically juxtaposed with Sal singing an English nursery rhyme and reminding us that her roots are firmly in London. Iain Grandage\u2019s music is an essential part of Armfield\u2019s production about which I have only one complaint. Having entrusted the story\u2019s narration to the powerful figure of Ningali Lawford Wolf, it seems a pity that so many of her words are obscured by the score. Otherwise everything is ideal. Nathaniel Dean as William suggests a decent, hardworking man trapped by a mixture of ignorance and condescension while Georgia Adamson, as his wife, displays a far superior awareness of historical reality. There is outstanding support from Jeremy Sims as a brutish white settler, Melissa Jaffer as a sage, pipe-smoking elder and from Major \u201cMoogy\u201d Sumner as a white-bearded Dharug veteran. Armfield also stages the play with an admirable clarity aided by superb lighting from Mark Howett that captures Australia\u2019s ochre sunsets. It is a work that takes its time but memorably and movingly pinpoints a crucial moment in Australian history, while suggesting that we are witnessing a reenactment of an unending colonial tragedy. \u2022 At King\u2019s theatre, Edinburgh, until 11 August and at the National Theatre, London, from 22 August to 7 September. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews",

Owner-chef Nana Thong-In serves up belly-pleasing bowls of north Thai staples like boat noodles and pork laab inside a cosy space but also on a very welcome patio where you can watch the world go by. Around the corner, it\u2019s Mexican street food at El Dorado that attracts a crowd. You\u2019ll know why once you sample their scallop ceviche. There are great Greek, Japanese and Mediterranean options nearby. All of this in what is officially Little Italy. \u2018A must-see spot in Ottawa is the very Instagrammable La Terrasse that opened up at the Fairmont Ch\u00e2teau Laurier. The cocktails are incredible, the terrace itself is gorgeous and the views are some of the best in the city.\u2019 Dominique Baker, @dominique.baker Hintonburg and beyond A venture farther west again to Hintonburg is worth it for many reasons, but the Latino fusion delights of The Soca Kitchen (don\u2019t leave without trying the octopus carpaccio) make it particularly worthwhile. The Soca Kitchen In this town \u2013 and in this moment \u2013 it pays to leave room for something sweet though. Ottawa is going through an ice-cream arms race, with a surge of new openings vying for supremacy. Favourites \u2013 such as Moo Shu and Pascale\u2019s \u2013 are being challenged by Merry Dairy in Hintonburg and Sundae School just north of downtown. The diplomatic route may be found in just trying them all. Politics will become an even hotter topic in Ottawa this autumn with the approach of another federal election. Canada\u2019s political appetites may be up for debate \u2026 but those of its capital city are most definitely not. It\u2019s time to dig in.

landholders were not permitted to clear land where critically endangered communities were known to occur unless they made an application to the state\u2019s native vegetation panel or the clearing was for small items such as a fence line.</p> \n<p>But under the amendment to the state\u2019s native vegetation code \u2013 published Friday but made on 8 July \u2013 landholders will be allowed to clear

recent scrutiny of federal and state investigations involving grasslands in the Monaro region which were <a

illegally by a company part-owned by the federal energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor</a>.</p> \n<p>The grassy woodlands that are the subject of the NSW amendment are different ecological communities to the grasslands in the Taylor case, but they do occur in the same area.</p> \n<p>The NSW government has not made clear why these grassy woodlands, in particular, were captured by the new amendment.</p> \n<p>The Monaro grassy woodlands are found in the south-eastern highlands region of NSW, and the Werriwa grassy woodlands are found in both the south-eastern highlands and the south-east corner bioregions.</p> \n<p>When the NSW threatened species scientific committee made its determination, it said the intent was that \u201call occurrences of the ecological community (both recorded and as yet unrecorded, and independent of their condition) that occur within this bioregion be covered by this determination\u201d.</p> \n<p>Chris Gambian, the chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, said ecologists had warned the government recently that both grassy woodlands \u201care on the threshold of extinction\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government\u2019s response is now to give big agribusiness licence to clear it all by creating a loophole big enough to drive a bulldozer through,\u201d Gambian said.</p> \n<p>Evan Quartermain, the head of programs at the Australian arm of Humane Society International, said the practicality of regulations was important from both a community engagement and compliance perspective when it came to preserving threatened habitats in highly managed agricultural regions.</p> \n<p>But he said when the habitats in question were on the brink of extinction \u2013 as demonstrated by a critically endangered listing \u2013 \u201cthe science must be respected and their protection paramount\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen NSW environment laws were overhauled in 2016 the fact that critically endangered habitats were the only ones for which clearing couldn\u2019t be authorised through a code was a sore point for the conservation movement,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

endangered and vulnerable habitats, and that code amendments are now being made to remove the higher standard that would otherwise apply to the most threatened biodiversity is very

\n<p>\u201cThese changes will deliver a balanced outcome. They will ensure adequate protections for ecological communities while protecting farmers\u2019 right to farm,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Kean said it would bring a more practical approach to protecting threatened species on private land.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis approach has been taken, due to specific regulatory implications arising from the threatened species scientific committee\u2019s listing of the grassy woodlands in the Monaro and Werriwa tablelands,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe NSW government\u2019s approach protects the environment while allowing landholders flexibility to manage their land in cases where the vegetation does not form an ecological community that would be viable in the long term.\u201d</p>",

Both the Monaro and Werriwa grassy woodlands are what is known as an ecological community, which is habitat that consists of multiple species. They were designated critically endangered in NSW at the end of June after an assessment by the state\u2019s scientific committee. Previously, landholders were not permitted to clear land where critically endangered communities were known to occur unless they made an application to the state\u2019s native vegetation panel or the clearing was for small items such as a fence line. But under the amendment to the state\u2019s native vegetation code \u2013 published Friday but made on 8 July \u2013 landholders will be allowed to clear if an assessment by local land services staff determines the quality of the grassy woodlands is low and unlikely to be viable in the long term. This approach already applies to ecological communities declared vulnerable or endangered, but this is the first instance where it has been used for critically endangered communities. The independent MLC Justin Field will move in the NSW parliament this week for the new regulation to be disallowed. \u201cThis is just the latest gift to farming mates from the Liberal National government who refuse to be influenced by science or guided by fair process,\u201d Field said. \u201cThis sets a dangerous precedent by singling out a small but noisy constituency for special treatment.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The decision follows recent scrutiny of federal and state investigations involving grasslands in the Monaro region which were allegedly cleared illegally by a company part-owned by the federal energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor. The grassy woodlands that are the subject of the NSW amendment are different ecological communities to the grasslands in the Taylor case, but they do occur in the same area. The NSW government has not made clear why these grassy woodlands, in particular, were captured by the new amendment. The Monaro grassy woodlands are found in the south-eastern highlands region of NSW, and the Werriwa grassy woodlands are found in both the south-eastern highlands and the south-east corner bioregions. When the NSW threatened species scientific committee made its determination, it said the intent was that \u201call occurrences of the ecological community (both recorded and as yet unrecorded, and independent of their condition) that occur within this bioregion be covered by this determination\u201d. Chris Gambian, the chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, said ecologists had warned the government recently that both grassy woodlands \u201care on the threshold of extinction\u201d. \u201cThe government\u2019s response is now to give big agribusiness licence to clear it all by creating a loophole big enough to drive a bulldozer through,\u201d Gambian said. Evan Quartermain, the head of programs at the Australian arm of Humane Society International, said the practicality of regulations was important from both a community engagement and compliance perspective when it came to preserving threatened habitats in highly managed agricultural regions. But he said when the habitats in question were on the brink of extinction \u2013 as demonstrated by a critically endangered listing \u2013 \u201cthe science must be respected and their protection paramount\u201d. \u201cWhen NSW environment laws were overhauled in 2016 the fact that critically endangered habitats were the only ones for which clearing couldn\u2019t be authorised through a code was a sore point for the conservation movement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a decision that meant inevitable destruction of more endangered and vulnerable habitats, and that code amendments are now being made to remove the higher standard that would otherwise apply to the most threatened biodiversity is very disappointing.\u201d Marshall said both of the new listed communities occurred in areas that were \u201calready significantly degraded by a long history of active agricultural use\u201d. \u201cThese changes will deliver a balanced outcome. They will ensure adequate protections for ecological communities while protecting farmers\u2019 right to farm,\u201d he said. Kean said it would bring a more practical approach to protecting threatened species on private land. \u201cThis approach has been taken, due to specific regulatory implications arising from the threatened species scientific committee\u2019s listing of the grassy woodlands in the Monaro and Werriwa tablelands,\u201d he said. \u201cThe NSW government\u2019s approach protects the environment while allowing landholders flexibility to manage their land in cases where the vegetation does not form an ecological community that would be viable in the long term.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In 1976 the groundbreaking choreographer Peter Darrell debuted Mary Queen of Scots, an attempt to tell the story of the doomed monarch entirely through the medium of dance. \u201cDarrell\u2019s ballet is historically pretty accurate,\u201d James Kennedy wrote in his review for the Guardian. \u201cThe events, as here transmuted into classical dance, did (more or less) happen. Why did Darrell and his lively company do it? Well, you can have marvellous historical plays and poignant, if imperfect, historical operas, so why not a successful historical ballet?\u201d Forty-three years have now passed since Darrell\u2019s ballet opened to the public, a near-half-century of constant innovation in the arts. Attempting to describe historical events through dance is no longer so groundbreaking but a new canvas has been found \u2013 and it uses shirts as its stage, and polyester instead of pirouettes. \u201cThe right answer as is proved, for the umpteenth time, by this three-hour long misadventure, is that ballet, or any kind of dance for that matter, is no good at telling protracted, intricate stories,\u201d continued Kennedy in his review, but it is as nothing compared to football kits, perhaps the most confusing method yet invented for spinning a complex yarn. Manchester City took to the field for the Community Shield final in a shirt of refreshing simplicity, entirely without sponsors and unburdened by frippery. Inevitably they will wear it only once and the rest of the work Puma has done for the club this year stands as an exemplar of the more extreme end of modern kit design. The home kit tells the story of the post-industrial north with a \u201cwoven Jacquard wave pattern [which] is a visual representation of the looms which were integral to the industrial revolution in Manchester\u201d. The away shirt \u201cis directly inspired by former nightclub, The Ha\u00e7ienda\u201d, which is to say it is basically black (presumably because it was often dark when the Ha\u00e7ienda was open). The right sleeve has a sky blue trim and the left sleeve peach, which we are expected to believe \u201ccreates a colourful representation of this legendary cultural icon that was the heartbeat of the city\u201d. Their third kit uses the colours yellow and peach to \u201cembody the modernity of the club and its mission to play attractive, technically skilled and attacking football\u201d. The casual observer could no more decipher any of this than they could a balletic distillation of Mary\u2019s marriage to the Dauphin of France, and there\u2019s more of it to come: \u201cManchester is renowned for its music scene and for sure in future seasons we\u2019ll see inspiration coming from different kinds of music within the city,\u201d pledges Josele Angulo, who led Puma\u2019s design team, offering a tantalising teaser for a future version based on the Inspiral Carpets\u2019 squiggly-eyed cow. Gone, it seems, are the days when it was enough for a new kit to look good, or just a bit different. Contemporary designers need extensive knowledge of a club\u2019s history, geography and even, sometimes, its architecture. Chelsea\u2019s new home shirt \u201cis covered in an all-over graphic comprising imagery of the famous North Stand, the East and West Stands and the raucous Shed End merged into an abstract print\u201d. The club have been talking about redeveloping their ground for many years, which is perhaps why they have produced a shirt which looks if anything like a post-demolition Stamford Bridge. Everton\u2019s features some diagonal lines \u2013 or, in kit-designer speak, \u201ca modern graphic influenced by the distinctive crisscrossed steelwork from the upper tier of the Bullens Road stand, the work of legendary stadium architect Archibald Leitch\u201d. Their away kit, meanwhile, is in an unusual shade of orangey-pink which is officially defined as \u201cliving coral\u201d. \u201cWe knew that this particular colour would strike a chord with the Everton fans,\u201d said Robin Dunn, Umbro\u2019s head of performance, \u201cas they have a familiar history of salmon and coral coloured strips.\u201d This amounts to a similarly hued shirt worn in 1890-91, which would test the memory of even the most long-toothed supporter, and as a third kit for one season since. Umbro also make West Ham\u2019s kit but has resisted the temptation to describe their away strip as \u201cdead coral\u201d and gone with the more traditional \u201cwhite\u201d. It is \u201cinspired by the class of 1980\u201d \u2013 winners in white of the FA Cup that year \u2013 and is thus not to be confused with last year\u2019s third kit, which was also all-white but for different reasons. Similarly Newcastle\u2019s home kit \u201cpays tribute to the 50th anniversary of the club\u2019s Inter-Cities Fairs Cup win\u201d, though it is as different to its predecessor as it is possible to get while still featuring black and white stripes. Manchester United\u2019s home kit features multiple nods to the 1998-99 treble winners, while on their travels their shirts will feature \u201ca fresh savannah-toned aesthetic\u201d and \u201can intricate patterned design that takes its inspiration from the many mosaics that adorn the streets of Manchester\u2019s creative district, the Northern Quarter\u201d. Liverpool\u2019s away and third kits feature, respectively, \u201ca design that takes inspiration from iconic street signs around Anfield\u201d (in other words, it\u2019s white), and a graphic that \u201cpays homage to the shape of Liverpool\u2019s street signs\u201d (it\u2019s rectangular).

      "bodyText": "Scores of women who have had abortions have come out on social media urging authorities to arrest them, ahead of the New South Wales state parliament considering a decriminalisation bill this week. NSW is the only Australian state or territory that has neglected to modernise abortion laws. Emily Mayo, who underwent a termination in 2005, started the #ArrestUs campaign on Facebook and Twitter on Monday afternoon. Mayo said she was inspired by reading about 80 women in the 1970s who took out a advertisement in a national newspaper to campaign for legalising abortion. \u201cThe women who took out the advert in the 1970s did it because they could. They had the privilege to be able to speak up and they believed they had a responsibility to do so,\u201d Mayo\u2019s post on Facebook read. \u201cAnd so it is time again, for those of us who can stand up and speak out to do so. One last time.\u201d Last week a private member\u2019s bill co-sponsored by 15 MPs from across the political divide was introduced to state parliament. It is expected to be debated as soon as Tuesday when parliament sits. It would remove abortion from the state\u2019s criminal code and create a standalone healthcare act to regulate the procedure. Mayo said 56 women and counting had put their names to the campaign so far. The list included women who had abortions as recently as six weeks ago to several decades ago. She was initially worried about the reaction of her campaign but said it had been taken with absolute positivity. \u201cI was really fearful today, and every time I thought, \u2018oh my gosh, oh my gosh\u2019 I thought this is exactly why we\u2019re doing it,\u201d Mayo told the Guardian.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Another signatory, Summer Finlay from Wollongong, said she also had to scramble to tell her mum before making her 2002 abortion public knowledge. \u201cAbortion is very much a personal issue and a health issue and women have a variety of different reasons why they may want to terminate. It\u2019s important women have that choice,\u201d Finlay said. Finlay had only been dating a man for a couple of months when she fell pregnant at age 21. \u201cThey\u2019re not easy decisions to make,\u201d Finlay said. She reflected that in some parts of regional NSW it can be difficult to obtain terminations and the illegal status added to stigma and taboo around the issue. \u201cThis is about keeping women safe,\u201d Finlay said. The campaign comes as the Uniting church has thrown its support behind decriminalisation. In an open letter to MPs, the Uniting church reverend Simon Hansford argued abortion was a health and social issue and should not be a criminal issue. \u201cRespect for the sacredness of life means advocating for the needs of women as well as every unborn child,\u201d Hansford said. \u201cWhilst we encourage our ministers to remind people of the sacredness of life, the church\u2019s role should be to offer care and support leading up to and following a decision, not stand in judgment.\u201d The former National party leader Barnaby Joyce has launched an online petition against the bill, which has almost 8,000 signatures. His petition calls for a parliamentary inquiry into the issue and warns against rushing the legislative process. \u201cThe most vulnerable people in our society are the children that are unborn,\u201d Joyce wrote in the post. \u201cEvery life is a miracle.

      "body": "<p>On Saturday night, Colby Covington dominated former UFC welterweight champion Robbie Lawler en route to victory in Newark, New Jersey. Once the final bell sounded, Covington climbed the cage and pointed at Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump in celebration while the US president\u2019s sons cheered him on. Moments later, he would begin his post-fight interview with a political statement.</p> <p>\u201cI was truly inspired when the first family came in the building and came to see me backstage,\u201d Covington said. \u201cLet\u2019s give it up for the Trumps. They\u2019re keeping America great.\u201d</p> <p>And indeed, several of the Trump siblings were in attendance that night specifically to support Covington \u2013 the athletic personification of Trump\u2019s political ideology.</p> <p>Covington is unlike any other fighter under contract with the UFC. Regularly pictured in Make America Great Again hats or posing alongside adult actresses and models, the fighter has built his brand on using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)\">pro-wrestling style \u201cheel\u201d tactics</a> to antagonize a significant portion of UFC\u2019s fanbase while simultaneously cementing himself as a favourite amongst the United States\u2019 rightwing sports demographic. Part troll, part conservative mouthpiece, Covington has said \u201cI\u2019m the great American winning machine. I\u2019m addicted to winning, just like Trump\u201d and has referred to the sitting president as \u201c<a href=\"https://mymmanews.com/colby-covington-visiting-donald-trump/\">America\u2019s champion</a>.\u201d</p> <p>A turning point in Covington\u2019s campaign to become the athletic representation of Trump politics came in August 2018 when the then-UFC interim welterweight champion visited the Oval Office with UFC president Dana White. During the reportedly hour-long visit, Covington posed alongside Trump, who wore the champion\u2019s belt on his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cTrump was really cool,\u201d Covington <a href=\"https://mymmanews.com/colby-covington-visiting-donald-trump/\">said</a> in 2019. \u201cHe kept calling me \u2018Champ\u2019. As soon as I gave him the belt he tried to give it back to me. I told him \u2018No, Mr President this belt is for you. You are the champion of the American people.

      "bodyText": "On Saturday night, Colby Covington dominated former UFC welterweight champion Robbie Lawler en route to victory in Newark, New Jersey. Once the final bell sounded, Covington climbed the cage and pointed at Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump in celebration while the US president\u2019s sons cheered him on. Moments later, he would begin his post-fight interview with a political statement. \u201cI was truly inspired when the first family came in the building and came to see me backstage,\u201d Covington said. \u201cLet\u2019s give it up for the Trumps. They\u2019re keeping America great.\u201d And indeed, several of the Trump siblings were in attendance that night specifically to support Covington \u2013 the athletic personification of Trump\u2019s political ideology. Covington is unlike any other fighter under contract with the UFC. Regularly pictured in Make America Great Again hats or posing alongside adult actresses and models, the fighter has built his brand on using pro-wrestling style \u201cheel\u201d tactics to antagonize a significant portion of UFC\u2019s fanbase while simultaneously cementing himself as a favourite amongst the United States\u2019 rightwing sports demographic. Part troll, part conservative mouthpiece, Covington has said \u201cI\u2019m the great American winning machine. I\u2019m addicted to winning, just like Trump\u201d and has referred to the sitting president as \u201cAmerica\u2019s champion.\u201d A turning point in Covington\u2019s campaign to become the athletic representation of Trump politics came in August 2018 when the then-UFC interim welterweight champion visited the Oval Office with UFC president Dana White. During the reportedly hour-long visit, Covington posed alongside Trump, who wore the champion\u2019s belt on his shoulder. \u201cTrump was really cool,\u201d Covington said in 2019. \u201cHe kept calling me \u2018Champ\u2019. As soon as I gave him the belt he tried to give it back to me. I told him \u2018No, Mr President this belt is for you. You are the champion of the American people. You are making this country great again.\u2019\u201d While Covington\u2019s partiality to Trump has helped him stand out amongst a roster packed with nearly 600 fighters, the welterweight antics have also lead to accusations of racism and xenophobia. Following his upset victory over former title contender Demian Maia in October 2017, Covington called Brazil a \u201cdump\u201d and told the local crowd that \u201call you filthy animals suck\u201d \u2013 an incident that led to a confrontation with former UFC heavyweight champion Fabricio Werdum. The Brazilian fighter allegedly attacked Covington with a boomerang outside of a hotel in Australia and was charged with assault as a result. The UFC later released a statement revealing that they were investigating the situation. However, neither fighter faced any repercussions and Covington was allowed to continue spewing hate to promote his fights. The UFC welterweight has since denied being a racist, instead claiming, \u201cI\u2019m not a racist, I\u2019m just a realist. Just calling it how I see it.\u201d And yet he continued to use xenophobia to strategically place himself in potential title fights. He set his sights on UFC welterweight champion Kamaru Usman, a Nigerian-Muslim fighter who resides in the United States. Covington\u2019s comments led to an altercation between the two men at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas. Two days later, Covington told ESPN that he was \u201cnot going to press charges\u201d because he disn\u2019t want Usman\u2019s \u201cass deported back to Nigeria.\u201d Covington is not the only fighter who has made racist, sexist, or xenophobic statements during his UFC tenure; former heavyweight champion Fabricio Werdum was forced to apologise for using a homophobic slur in 2017, while superstar Conor McGregor used xenophobia and Islamophobia to provoke lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov. However, Covington is the only fighter who has managed to parlay his racism and political leaning into an opportunity to meet the President of the United States. He is also the only fighter using his platform to regurgitate statements made on the President\u2019s Twitter account, emphasizing his role in the dissemination of Trump\u2019s controversial politics.

He has retweeted posts from Donald Trump Jr claiming that the migrant caravans that arrived at the US-Mexico border from Central America were an \u201cobvious political stunt\u201d, and even told actor Chris Evans to \u201cquit the crying and shut your slimy liberal mouth before I shut it for you #MAGA\u201d when Evans spoke out against Kanye West wearing a MAGA hat. In June 2018, just two months shy of his visit to the Oval Office, Covington called the NFL\u2019s Philadelphia Eagles and the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors \u201closers\u201d and criticized the teams for refusing to visit to the White House following their respective national championships. He underlined his distaste for activism in sports by calling Colin Kaepernick a \u201cspineless sack of shit\u201d along with the hashtag #NikeBoycott, then doubled down by tweeting at NFL players, \u201cYou may kneel before me, but be prepared to get slapped if the National Anthem is playing.\u201d Covington makes his politics clear in his media appearances too. During a recent interview with MMAFighting, Covington hinted that he might speak at the Republican National Convention ahead of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cThat would be a bigger spotlight or any opportunity could ever bring me,\u201d Covington said. \u201cIt would be such an honor to speak on President Trump\u2019s behalf at the [Republican National Convention].

Played by a five-strong ensemble on a tilted, rotating platform, the piece conjures up a whole European world with the aid of simple props, such as steel barriers and the actors\u2019 expressive bodies. Ajjaz Awad, Esme Bayley, Daniel Cahill and Reuben Joseph all impress but the real hero is Kastrati, who acknowledges that endurance exacts its price as, briefly returning to Albania, he poignantly asks: \u201cWhere is my home?\u201d \u2022 At Traverse, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews",

      "bodyText": "A Sydney local councillor\u2019s behaviour has been found to amount to homosexual vilification after she verbally abused a neighbour for displaying a rainbow flag on the day of the same-sex marriage postal survey result. Julie Passas, who was the deputy mayor of Inner West council at the time, told neighbour Daniel Comensoli the flag he erected to celebrate the 61% Yes vote was \u201coffensive to my culture and religion\u201d and that he should not be allowed to marry \u201cuntil you could breastfeed and have children\u201d. Two days later, she told visiting police officers \u201cthe rainbow flag was as offensive as the flag of Isis\u201d, in a voice loud enough for neighbours to have heard it from inside their houses. The NSW civil and administrative tribunal found that the initial conduct on the day of the vote amounted to inciting hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule towards homosexual people, under the Anti-Discrimination Act. However, the local councillor\u2019s subsequent comments, when she loudly told a neighbour that Comensoli was \u201cdisgusting\u201d were found not to amount to vilification. The tribunal has ordered Passas to pay Comensoli damages of $2,500 and publish an apology for her conduct in the local Inner West Courier newspaper. The act provides exemptions for vilification for things done in good faith for academic, artistic, religious or scientific purposes, including discussions or debate \u201cof any act or matter\u201d \u2013 but Passas did not apply for any exemptions. At the time of the vilification, Passas and Comensoli lived next to each other in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield, where Passas had been a local councillor for 11 years. According to court documents, Comensoli placed a large rainbow flag outside his apartment on the night of 15 November 2017 in celebration of the Yes result. He claimed he was in the driveway when he heard Passas \u201cyelling at him from her apartment balcony\u201d. \u201c[Passas] loudly demanded from [Comensoli] that he remove the flag because it was \u2018offensive to my culture and religion\u2019. [Comensoli] refused, to which [Passas] loudly stated words to the effect that [he] should not be afforded the right to marry \u2018until you could breastfeed and have children\u2019,\u201d according Comensoli\u2019s version of events. \u201cThe exchange was loud enough that it could be heard by other residents in the complex and surrounding areas.\u201d Comensoli also claimed Passas complained to other residents to have him evicted. Two days later, Comensoli and his housemate Ashleigh DiNatale were at home when they heard Passas telling a neighbour, from their shared driveway, that they were \u201cdisgusting people\u201d. A day after this, Comensoli made a formal complaint to Ashfield police. When the police visited Passas at home, Comensoli said he could hear from his house that she said \u201cthe rainbow flag was as offensive as the flag of Isis.\u201d Passas denied she told police the rainbow flag was \u201csimilar\u201d to the flag of Isis, but admitted to the tribunal that she referred to it \u201cas an analogy\u201d. Passas admitted she had asked him to remove the flag, but \u201cdenied that she had done so in an aggressive, loud, or offensive manner\u201d. The tribunal found that, on the balance of probabilities, Comensoli\u2019s account of events was correct. \u201cIn evidence, [Comensoli] was direct, clear and made appropriate concessions, including that the display of the rainbow flag on 15 November 2017 was in breach of the strata regulations, and that he had publicised the incident by disseminating the conversation with the respondent on Facebook. \u201cIn contrast, [Passas] had a very poor recollection of the events she was questioned about \u2026 and was defensive and deflective in her responses to [Comensoli\u2019s] questioning. \u201cShe was easily inflamed when questioned about her conduct and stated in cross-examination that the concept of gay marriage was offensive to her, was offensive to her upbringing and religion, and that [Comensoli] \u2018made the whole thing up because of a gay issue\u2019, \u2018turned it into a gay issue\u2019 when \u2018it was about strata\u2019 and was \u2018only continuing because of support for him from her political opponents\u2019.\u201d The tribunal found that Passas\u2019s behaviour on 15 November had amounted to vilification.The test for vilification is an objective test, which means it is judged by reference to \u201can ordinary member\u201d of the public. \u201cThe manner in which the respondent made her demand was inappropriate and objectively likely to incite hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule of homosexual persons, and other LGBTQIA+ persons for whom the rainbow flag is an accepted symbol of identity, in an ordinary member of the general public. The tribunal found that an objective understanding of Passas\u2019s statements inferred \u201cthat a person who can\u2019t breastfeed or have children should not be afforded an equal right to marry the person of their choosing\u201d. It also found the statement \u201cis objectively likely to rouse, stimulate, urge, stir up or animate hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule of homosexual men.\u201d The tribunal found her comments created the impression that \u201chomosexual men are \u2018worthless\u2019 or of \u2018little account\u2019\u201d. But Passas\u2019s later comments were found not to amount to vilification. \u201cIn any event, neither of the incidents of 16 and 17 November 2017 constitute, of their own right, homosexual vilification within the meaning of the Act.\u201d The conversation that included calling him \u201cdisgusting\u201d made \u201cno specific or implied reference to homosexual men or homosexuality, or characteristics of homosexuality\u201d.",

Pep Guardiola and his players would never concede the point publicly but a deal in which the FA and Carabao Cups are not retained in exchange for a third consecutive title and a run to the Champions League final would surely be snapped up. This is the equation Guardiola may light upon when assessing the clean sweep of home competitions in what was a season for the ages from his team. Here the manager\u2019s analysis would run that to retain the Premier League and take City beyond their best return of a European Cup semi-final his forces must be marshalled differently. City\u2019s Champions League quarter-final elimination by Tottenham Hotspur was by the tightest of margins: defeat on away goals after the tie ended 4-4. City would have triumphed if Raheem Sterling\u2019s late strike had not been ruled out by VAR, and being unable to score in the opening leg meant they failed to gain an edge that might have proved vital. This, though, is the point: a City side whose focus and energies were not diluted by having to battle for all four available trophies could have swung the percentages their way and not allowed a Spurs team who were overpowered by Liverpool in the final to scrape through. Guardiola\u2019s ethos of believing every match should be won is admirable but in 2019-20 mental and physical resources will be saved if the FA and League Cups are sacrificed and retaining the league (again) and becoming champions of the continent is made the holy grail. Liverpool, of course, are buoyed by that sixth European Cup triumph and will be intent on overtaking City to claim an inaugural Premier League crown. The two sides traded blows in an unusually feisty Community Shield and J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side were only a point short of a stunning double of their own last season.

Danilo, his understudy, would be allowed to go and talks have reopened over Jo\u00e3o Cancelo of Juventus. Should Leroy San\u00e9 remain a City player \u2013 he is Bayern Munich\u2019s \u201cdream\u201d signing, according to their manager, Niko Kovac \u2013 this can be chalked up as major success given the forward\u2019s sublime talent and the pull of the German champions. None of the above, though, can be rated more than low-level trifles for Guardiola, underlining what a smoothly professional operation City are. The bigger issue could lie with the manager himself: can he again self-motivate and fire up his squad for a nine-month assault on success? The 48-year-old prides himself on unerring self-analysis, knowing where, precisely, he is regarding energy levels, contentment and desire. The year\u2019s sabbatical taken after coaching Barcelona to recharge is evidence of this. But, subconsciously, might Guardiola slacken off even the half a per cent that can be crucial? It is unlikely. Given his love of the pursuit of excellence plus the chance to claim a third successive title and make City only one of five clubs to do so in England \u2013 Manchester United (twice), Liverpool, Arsenal and Huddersfield Town are the others \u2013 the manager\u2019s hunger should remain unsated. Here, Liverpool can be unwitting helpers. Just as the Manchester United of mid-era Sir Alex Ferguson were propelled forward by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s Arsenal so Liverpool\u2019s desire to dethrone City can be harnessed by Guardiola. The hiccup of the plane to Shanghai for the start of City\u2019s tour being delayed by 48 hours was followed by the 6-1 defeat of Kitchee, a penalty shootout defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers, a 4-1 win over West Ham United and the 3-1 win over their sister club Yokohama Marinos before Sunday\u2019s Community Shield win over Liverpool on penalties. When City travel to West Ham for their season opener on Saturday they will still be the side to beat.",

      "body": "<p>The legend that Shannon Lee grew up with goes like this. In 1971, when her father <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/01/bruce-lee-ip-man\">Bruce Lee</a> was at the height of his Hollywood kung fu fame, he tried to develop a TV show called The Warrior. It followed a Chinese immigrant with martial arts skills who gets caught up in the Tong wars of the late 1800s, the violent clashes between rival factions in Chinatowns across America. Our hero finds himself journeying through the wild west.</p> <p>Lee envisaged himself in the leading role, and pitched The Warrior to a US studio, which told him that America wasn\u2019t ready for an Asian leading man. A year later, Warner Bros released <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY6HgFyoupw\">Kung Fu</a>, which followed a Shaolin monk with martial arts skills journeying through the wild west. The monk was played by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/05/obituary-david-carradine\">white actor: David Carradine</a>.</p> <p>So Lee, frustrated with Hollywood, returned to Hong Kong, where he made Fist of Fury, Way of the Dragon and Enter the Dragon, the three films that secured his legend and saw his image \u2013 washboard stomach, raised fists, ready for action \u2013 plastered across posters in student flats the world over. That legend only grew after the star died suddenly in 1973 at the age of 32. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd1e7398fa2168e7af09cc68801683c893293d35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd1e7398fa2168e7af09cc68801683c893293d35/112_0_2808_1684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe grew up with this story,\u201d says Shannon. \u201cThat my father created this show and was told he couldn\u2019t star in it because American audiences wouldn\u2019t accept a Chinese leading man. If you were to speak to Warner Bros, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d say they had the idea [for Kung Fu] prior to my father\u2019s pitch. However, they have a lot of similarities, so you know\u2026\u201d</p> <p>While Shannon, now 50, never doubted her dad\u2019s story, it was only in her mid-30s that she began to uncover just how detailed his pitch for the show was. \u201cIn late 2000,\u201d she says, \u201cI agreed to take over looking after my father\u2019s legacy from my mother and she sent his things to me in LA. There were boxes and boxes of writing. While I was going through them, I came across the treatment for The Warrior. It was this revelatory moment, \u2018Wow, it really does exist!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At that time, Shannon \u201cdidn\u2019t feel ready\u201d to tackle a TV show, so she put the notes back in the box, where they stayed \u2013 until she received an out-of-the-blue call from Fast and Furious director Justin Lin. \u201cHe said, \u2018I just wanted to ask you a question \u2013 I\u2019ve always heard this story that your dad had an idea for a TV show. Do you have any idea what happened to it?\u2019 I laughed and said, \u2018Yeah, I have it right here.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b463a6c777ce17b95ad83a81cdbb450973f4538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b463a6c777ce17b95ad83a81cdbb450973f4538/302_181_7727_4636/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warrior, the new series on HBO starring Andrew Koji, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warrior, the new Cinemax series starring Andrew Koji, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lin brought on board Jonathan Tropper, the co-creator and writer of superviolent smalltown crime saga <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/31/banshee-box-set-review\">Banshee</a>.

Koji told the US website Collider that he was influenced by Lee\u2019s own philosophy: \u201cIf I just wanted to look good because I want to be flashy and fancy, it would be what Bruce Lee would\u2019ve called an empty, hollow mess.\u201d</p> <p>For Shannon, the show\u2019s executive producer, it\u2019s the perfect realisation of her father\u2019s dream. \u201cNot only have they righted the original wrong and cast an actual Asian in the lead role, they\u2019ve created this whole complex world that\u2019s dynamic and funny and interesting and sexy.

And I\u2019d think, \u2018But how can I because I was so young when he died.\u2019 Then I realised my strongest memory of him was the feeling of him. When I think of him, it\u2019s his energy and his love, the security I felt around him, his playfulness. In a strange sense, even though I lost him so young, I feel as though I know him in a very pure way, because my memory is uncluttered by resentment over the time he punished me by sending me to my room or told me not to date that boy.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always that easy. As children, she and her older brother Brandon struggled to cope with their father\u2019s memory \u2013 in particular with kung fu. \u201cThere was lots of grief and pressure around it, so my brother and I didn\u2019t study it at all,\u201d says Shannon. \u201cWe came round in our teens because martial arts was so important to my father and we felt we\u2019d have a closer connection if we took it up. I don\u2019t really practise it so much now.\u201d She studied jeet kune do, the method made famous by Lee, before she took up taekwondo, wushu and kickboxing to prepare her for acting roles in such martial arts films as Enter the Eagles and High Voltage.</p> <p>These days, she happily tends her father\u2019s flame, overseeing <a href=\"https://bruceleefoundation.org/\">The Bruce Lee Foundation</a>, which was founded in 2002 to spread his blend of jeet kune do and motivational philosophy. \u201cMy father was a self-educated man with this inner energy and I think that\u2019s what speaks to people.\u201d Lee does seem to have been ahead of his time: his vegetable-heavy, dairy-free diet and motivational sayings would be all over Instagram today. Such sayings included \u201cShowing off is the fool\u2019s idea of glory\u201d and \u201cIf you love life, don\u2019t waste time, for time is what life is made up of\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14f4a6d84d206111cd01b012ed51bb5ad2db1ff6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14f4a6d84d206111cd01b012ed51bb5ad2db1ff6/0_248_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They righted the original wrong and cast an actual Asian in the lead role\u2019 \u2026 Andrew Koji as Ah Sahm in Warrior.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They righted the original wrong and cast an actual Asian in the lead role\u2019 \u2026 Andrew Koji as Ah Sahm in Warrior.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does it feel hard knowing that so many people feel they have a claim on her father? \u201cFor sure. It\u2019s always funny when I meet people and they say, \u2018Oh, did you know that Bruce would do this or that?\u2019 And they\u2019re fans, they didn\u2019t know him even if they think they do.\u201d</p> <p>When we speak, she has yet to see Quentin Tarantino\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-dazzling-dicaprio-pitt\">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a>, which depicts her father as little more than comic relief \u2013 a dime-store philosopher whose hands \u201care registered as lethal weapons\u201d as he solemnly informs Brad Pitt\u2019s stunt man. \u201cIn a perfect world, I would have loved them to consult with me, but they didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI do know Mike Moh [the actor who plays Lee]. He\u2019s a lovely guy and I have nothing against him. But what I\u2019ve seen suggests they\u2019re poking fun at my father. I understand there\u2019s the chance to be irreverent and that\u2019s fine, but I hope it\u2019s not negative.\u201d</p> <p>Shannon later sees the film and hits out at it, telling <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/bruce-lee-daughter-mockery-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-shannon-lee/\">the Wrap</a> her father \u201ccomes across as an arrogant asshole who was full of hot air, and not someone who had to fight triple as hard as any of those people did to accomplish what was naturally given to so many others\u201d. She added: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/30/bruce-lee-daughter-father-portrayal-quentin-tarantino-film-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood\">It was really uncomfortable to sit in the theatre</a> and listen to people laugh at my father.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0db0bff04ec80f8f6bfc6e54a503eb97d20310d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0db0bff04ec80f8f6bfc6e54a503eb97d20310d0/0_0_2126_1276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shannon Lee in Enter the Eagles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shannon Lee in Enter the Eagles</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps she should have seen it coming. After all, during her father\u2019s lifetime, his appeal was continually misinterpreted by Hollywood. \u201cThey thought of him as a one-trick pony. They never understood the combination of skill, thoughtfulness and talent behind the image.\u201d It took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/sep/13/hong-kong-film-week-action\">Hong Kong</a> and the freedom it provided to reveal the real Lee, the one the world celebrates today. \u201cHollywood gave him one direction all the time whereas in Hong Kong, with Way of the Dragon, he wrote that film, he directed it, he starred in it, he choreographed it. He had full creative control. He was always writing \u2013 he had so many ideas.\u201d</p> <p>The success of Warrior, which has already been picked up for a second season, has a bittersweet resonance for Shannon, whose brother Brandon was on the verge of stardom when he died, aged 28. It happened during the filming of cult movie The Crow, when a <a href=\"https://variety.com/1993/film/news/brandon-lee-killed-on-set-105553/\">prop gun malfunctioned on set</a>. \u201cBrandon was such an artist,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had the ability to become a major star and if that had happened he would have been one of the first actors of Asian descent to cross over.\u201d She sighs and there is a long pause before she adds quietly: \u201cI think about my father and my brother all the time. I miss them the whole time.\u201d</p> <p>Another pause and then a laugh. \u201cBut in my own way, I also communicate with them \u2013 often quite energetically. And I feel protected and guided and overseen by them. On Warrior, people would come up to me the whole time and say, \u2018This feels great. I feel like your father is here with us.\u2019 I would say, \u2018Believe it\u2019 \u2013 because I really feel that he was.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Warrior is on Sky One on Tuesdays at 10pm. The whole series can be viewed at Sky On Demand and NowTV.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 August 2019.

Such sayings included \u201cShowing off is the fool\u2019s idea of glory\u201d and \u201cIf you love life, don\u2019t waste time, for time is what life is made up of\u201d. Does it feel hard knowing that so many people feel they have a claim on her father? \u201cFor sure. It\u2019s always funny when I meet people and they say, \u2018Oh, did you know that Bruce would do this or that?\u2019 And they\u2019re fans, they didn\u2019t know him even if they think they do.\u201d When we speak, she has yet to see Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which depicts her father as little more than comic relief \u2013 a dime-store philosopher whose hands \u201care registered as lethal weapons\u201d as he solemnly informs Brad Pitt\u2019s stunt man. \u201cIn a perfect world, I would have loved them to consult with me, but they didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI do know Mike Moh [the actor who plays Lee]. He\u2019s a lovely guy and I have nothing against him. But what I\u2019ve seen suggests they\u2019re poking fun at my father. I understand there\u2019s the chance to be irreverent and that\u2019s fine, but I hope it\u2019s not negative.\u201d Shannon later sees the film and hits out at it, telling the Wrap her father \u201ccomes across as an arrogant asshole who was full of hot air, and not someone who had to fight triple as hard as any of those people did to accomplish what was naturally given to so many others\u201d. She added: \u201cIt was really uncomfortable to sit in the theatre and listen to people laugh at my father.\u201d Perhaps she should have seen it coming. After all, during her father\u2019s lifetime, his appeal was continually misinterpreted by Hollywood. \u201cThey thought of him as a one-trick pony. They never understood the combination of skill, thoughtfulness and talent behind the image.\u201d It took Hong Kong and the freedom it provided to reveal the real Lee, the one the world celebrates today. \u201cHollywood gave him one direction all the time whereas in Hong Kong, with Way of the Dragon, he wrote that film, he directed it, he starred in it, he choreographed it. He had full creative control. He was always writing \u2013 he had so many ideas.\u201d The success of Warrior, which has already been picked up for a second season, has a bittersweet resonance for Shannon, whose brother Brandon was on the verge of stardom when he died, aged 28. It happened during the filming of cult movie The Crow, when a prop gun malfunctioned on set. \u201cBrandon was such an artist,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had the ability to become a major star and if that had happened he would have been one of the first actors of Asian descent to cross over.\u201d She sighs and there is a long pause before she adds quietly: \u201cI think about my father and my brother all the time. I miss them the whole time.\u201d Another pause and then a laugh. \u201cBut in my own way, I also communicate with them \u2013 often quite energetically. And I feel protected and guided and overseen by them. On Warrior, people would come up to me the whole time and say, \u2018This feels great. I feel like your father is here with us.\u2019 I would say, \u2018Believe it\u2019 \u2013 because I really feel that he was.\u201d \u2022 Warrior is on Sky One on Tuesdays at 10pm. The whole series can be viewed at Sky On Demand and NowTV. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 August 2019. In an earlier version, a picture caption incorrectly said Warrior was an HBO show.",

      "body": "<p>I had my DNA tested last year. I wasn\u2019t surprised to find out that most of me comes from Ireland, nor that more than 30% can be traced back to Benin and Mali, from where my ancestors were stolen and taken to the Caribbean. But English? Amazingly, a whole 10% of me comes from this land.</p> <p>When you are mixed-race it can be difficult to put your foot on the soil and feel at home anywhere; difficult to locate the place that owns you. It\u2019s not as simple as saying, \u201cI come from Manchester\u201d, or Liverpool or Bristol, because sometimes you can be made to feel like an outsider whatever your sense of belonging. But Moseley, the Birmingham suburb where I grew up, was never like that.</p> <p>The house my parents bought on Springfield Road in 1960 squeezed into the Moseley postcode by about 500 yards \u2013 since our street bled into the adjacent Irish area, less posh and more obviously immigrant \u2013 but that 500 yards was important. It was Moseley, my little piece of England, my 10%.</p> <p>Moseley Village was, in the 1960s and 70s, the epitome of bohemian. When I was 13 \u2013 so that\u2019s 1973 \u2013 my art teacher, a straight-up hippie, wore cord loons, a ban-the-bomb pendant and a handlebar moustache. His Joni Mitchell-esque wife had green hair. Green. 1973.

There was, way before it was a thing, an artisan baker and a tattoo parlour. One Moseley resident, Pete the Feet \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/moseley-legend-pete-feet-given-15820457\" title=\"\">who died recently</a> \u2013 never wore shoes. As in, never. Everyone waited for the winter when he would cave in and buy a pair of boots. It never came.</p> <p>By the time I was 16, if you weren\u2019t in a band you were an oddity. A friend of mine invited me to listen to him and his mates rehearse. White guys playing reggae? \u201cYeah, right,\u201d I thought, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_One_(record_label)\" title=\"\">Studio One</a> aficionado. OK, so it wasn\u2019t roots or rockers, but it was reggae \u2013 and those friends turned into UB40. My brother was also in a band, my sister was in a band, I sang backing vocals. But then so did everyone.</p> <p>Ornate Victorian mansions on Moseley\u2019s most prestigious wide avenues housed the teenage devotees of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race\" title=\"\">Rock Against Racism</a> and punk. In my brother\u2019s band there was the son of a surgeon; an Irish immigrant; a white, working-class kid; a drummer from St Kitts, and himself \u2013 a mixed-race boy with barely enough to eat. True multiculturalism was the norm.</p> <p>In the Prince of Wales, we debated with middle-class students and academics making one drink last the whole night. We sang angry songs at the Jug of Ale. We hurried down to the Moseley Arms for Thursday night lock-ins and passed out the next day in Moseley Private Park.

In Moseley, it was places of worship: you could change your religion every month for a year and still be kneeling somewhere in B13. There was a Hare Krishna centre, Scientologists, Rastafarians, communists (OK, not a religion but still \u2026), any number of Bible study groups and unaffiliated communes, Christadelphians, a synagogue and a beautiful 15th-century Anglican church. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reliably informed me that I would die at Armageddon if I didn\u2019t repent, but the Buddhists assured me that there was no death, only change. I puffed on that one for ages.</p> <p>It was a time to be alive, all right. It was also a time to die. My co-lodger, a beautiful, gentle man, believed he was an angel and escaped this earth by taking his own life. Some died so completely and spiritually in mental institutions and prisons that it\u2019s hard to remember who they were before. Overdoses were not rare.</p> <p>Nostalgia is dangerous bollocks. I moved 12 times in five years \u2013 from dive to slum, squat to sofa. I once rented a big room from a Polish woman who removed a grate from the ceiling in the basement boiler room below so the heat could waft occasionally into my Arctic bedsit. In another bedsit, carved out of the eaves of an Edwardian wreck, I shared the toilet with two men, both drunks without a good aim between them. Prostitution in the area brought kerb crawlers and abuse. Most of the time, I was broke, hungry, probably dirty and never quite cool. A few bad trips frightened me straight. I feared my angel escape was just around the corner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/20/zaffar-kunial-made-in-moseley\">Zaffar Kunial: \u2018Muhammad Ali gave me his autograph in Moseley \u2013 I kept it in my Parka\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One by one, friends drifted away and became barristers, counsellors, lecturers, electricians and mechanics. Eventually, the wise bit of me wised up and took control. But I was already shaped by Moseley. I would always be drawn to the weird and different, people with not enough to eat but plenty to say, to art and music and books and ideas, to the sense that there is an essential self and the closer you align your life to it, the happier you will be. I\u2019m talking to myself here.</p> <p>Moseley has moved on, too. After years of decline it\u2019s affluent again: in 2015 a Sunday Times poll named it the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-winner-birmingham-moseley-qqjjnfpwj0d\" title=\"\">best place to live in the UK</a>. It\u2019s not as bohemian, not as vibrant, and most of the old characters have gone. There are sleek new-build flats and hipster cafes, no more live gigs in beery upper rooms, and my singing voice has been compromised by age and tobacco. But, actually, it was never that good.

      "bodyText": "I had my DNA tested last year. I wasn\u2019t surprised to find out that most of me comes from Ireland, nor that more than 30% can be traced back to Benin and Mali, from where my ancestors were stolen and taken to the Caribbean. But English? Amazingly, a whole 10% of me comes from this land. When you are mixed-race it can be difficult to put your foot on the soil and feel at home anywhere; difficult to locate the place that owns you. It\u2019s not as simple as saying, \u201cI come from Manchester\u201d, or Liverpool or Bristol, because sometimes you can be made to feel like an outsider whatever your sense of belonging. But Moseley, the Birmingham suburb where I grew up, was never like that. The house my parents bought on Springfield Road in 1960 squeezed into the Moseley postcode by about 500 yards \u2013 since our street bled into the adjacent Irish area, less posh and more obviously immigrant \u2013 but that 500 yards was important. It was Moseley, my little piece of England, my 10%. Moseley Village was, in the 1960s and 70s, the epitome of bohemian. When I was 13 \u2013 so that\u2019s 1973 \u2013 my art teacher, a straight-up hippie, wore cord loons, a ban-the-bomb pendant and a handlebar moustache. His Joni Mitchell-esque wife had green hair. Green. 1973. Superb, I thought \u2013 or the 70s equivalent. In the village centre, two strange shops sold dangerous roots, tangy black teas and packaged food that smelt of yeast and forest. There was, way before it was a thing, an artisan baker and a tattoo parlour. One Moseley resident, Pete the Feet \u2013 who died recently \u2013 never wore shoes. As in, never. Everyone waited for the winter when he would cave in and buy a pair of boots. It never came. By the time I was 16, if you weren\u2019t in a band you were an oddity. A friend of mine invited me to listen to him and his mates rehearse. White guys playing reggae? \u201cYeah, right,\u201d I thought, a Studio One aficionado. OK, so it wasn\u2019t roots or rockers, but it was reggae \u2013 and those friends turned into UB40. My brother was also in a band, my sister was in a band, I sang backing vocals. But then so did everyone. Ornate Victorian mansions on Moseley\u2019s most prestigious wide avenues housed the teenage devotees of Rock Against Racism and punk. In my brother\u2019s band there was the son of a surgeon; an Irish immigrant; a white, working-class kid; a drummer from St Kitts, and himself \u2013 a mixed-race boy with barely enough to eat. True multiculturalism was the norm. In the Prince of Wales, we debated with middle-class students and academics making one drink last the whole night. We sang angry songs at the Jug of Ale. We hurried down to the Moseley Arms for Thursday night lock-ins and passed out the next day in Moseley Private Park. We tatted around the annual festival every summer and sang Stand Down, Margaret with Ranking Roger in the Fighting Cocks pub (\u201cthe Grappling Penis\u201d) and we schlepped down Salisbury Road to the arts centre for pottery and jewellery making. We wandered Moseley Bog, looking for what Tolkien had seen, and tramped our spliff butts into the mud. They say you\u2019re only ever six feet away from a rat. In Moseley, it was places of worship: you could change your religion every month for a year and still be kneeling somewhere in B13. There was a Hare Krishna centre, Scientologists, Rastafarians, communists (OK, not a religion but still \u2026), any number of Bible study groups and unaffiliated communes, Christadelphians, a synagogue and a beautiful 15th-century Anglican church. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses reliably informed me that I would die at Armageddon if I didn\u2019t repent, but the Buddhists assured me that there was no death, only change. I puffed on that one for ages. It was a time to be alive, all right. It was also a time to die. My co-lodger, a beautiful, gentle man, believed he was an angel and escaped this earth by taking his own life. Some died so completely and spiritually in mental institutions and prisons that it\u2019s hard to remember who they were before. Overdoses were not rare. Nostalgia is dangerous bollocks. I moved 12 times in five years \u2013 from dive to slum, squat to sofa. I once rented a big room from a Polish woman who removed a grate from the ceiling in the basement boiler room below so the heat could waft occasionally into my Arctic bedsit. In another bedsit, carved out of the eaves of an Edwardian wreck, I shared the toilet with two men, both drunks without a good aim between them. Prostitution in the area brought kerb crawlers and abuse. Most of the time, I was broke, hungry, probably dirty and never quite cool. A few bad trips frightened me straight. I feared my angel escape was just around the corner. One by one, friends drifted away and became barristers, counsellors, lecturers, electricians and mechanics. Eventually, the wise bit of me wised up and took control. But I was already shaped by Moseley. I would always be drawn to the weird and different, people with not enough to eat but plenty to say, to art and music and books and ideas, to the sense that there is an essential self and the closer you align your life to it, the happier you will be. I\u2019m talking to myself here. Moseley has moved on, too. After years of decline it\u2019s affluent again: in 2015 a Sunday Times poll named it the best place to live in the UK. It\u2019s not as bohemian, not as vibrant, and most of the old characters have gone. There are sleek new-build flats and hipster cafes, no more live gigs in beery upper rooms, and my singing voice has been compromised by age and tobacco. But, actually, it was never that good. Like I said, nostalgia is bollocks. \u2022 Kit de Waal is the author of The Trick to Time and Becoming Dinah",

      "body": "<p>Products sold at the till are by their nature impulse buys, appealing to our baser instincts, which sneak out when we aren\u2019t concentrating. In supermarkets, it\u2019s where they display sweets, trashy magazines and the <em>Daily Mail</em>. In bookshops, the tills used to be the domain of the novelty read \u2013 <em>Don\u2019ts for Husbands</em>, <em>Barry </em><em>Trotter</em> and <em>A Simples Life</em> \u2013 to name some of the most egregious. In recent years, though, we\u2019ve seen a more serious brand of author perched on the tills of our bookshops. There\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/04/embassy-of-cambodia-zadie-smith-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Embassy of Cambodia</em></a> by Zadie Smith, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lyra-s-oxford-552114.html\" title=\"\"><em>Lyra\u2019s Oxford</em></a> by Philip Pullman, <em>The Gifts of Reading</em> by Robert Macfarlane and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/we-should-all-be-feminists-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie.html\" title=\"\"><em>We Should All Be Feminists </em></a>by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. These books all tend to be short, around a fiver, presented in handy A6 format and yet are handsome, giftable hardbacks. They sell, as a rule, by the boatload.</p> <p>Joining this august lineup is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/06/katherine-rundell-only-time-kids-understand-world-when-they-read\" title=\"\">Katherine Rundell</a>, with a 50-page essay: <em>Why You Should Read Children\u2019s Books, Even Though You Are So Old and Wise</em>. Her thesis is clear and familiar \u2013 she finds that when she tells people she\u2019s an author of children\u2019s books, she\u2019s greeted with \u201croughly the same smile I\u2019d expect had I told them I made miniature bathroom furniture out of matchboxes, for the elves\u201d. This is another chapter in the genre wars, where writers of what Amitav Ghosh calls the \u201cgeneric outhouses\u201d \u2013 sci-fi, crime, thriller, YA and children\u2019s literature \u2013 complain that their work is not held in the regard reserved for literary fiction. Most of the arguments in this realm are axiomatic to the point of meaninglessness \u2013 all but the most fanatical literary hardliners accept that such generic boundaries are endlessly porous and that there are as many great genre novels as there are terrible works of literary fiction published each year.</p> <p>Rundell\u2019s argument is both more subtle and more interesting, though. There\u2019s something particular about children\u2019s fiction, she says, that can open up new perspectives for adults. The best children\u2019s fiction \u201chelps us refind things we may not even know we have lost\u201d, taking us back to a time when \u201cnew discoveries came daily and when the world was colossal, before the imagination was trimmed and neatened\u2026\u201d There\u2019s also something instructive in reading books that, as Rundell points out, are \u201cspecifically written to be read by a section of society without political or economic power\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Products sold at the till are by their nature impulse buys, appealing to our baser instincts, which sneak out when we aren\u2019t concentrating. In supermarkets, it\u2019s where they display sweets, trashy magazines and the Daily Mail. In bookshops, the tills used to be the domain of the novelty read \u2013 Don\u2019ts for Husbands, Barry Trotter and A Simples Life \u2013 to name some of the most egregious. In recent years, though, we\u2019ve seen a more serious brand of author perched on the tills of our bookshops. There\u2019s been The Embassy of Cambodia by Zadie Smith, Lyra\u2019s Oxford by Philip Pullman, The Gifts of Reading by Robert Macfarlane and We Should All Be Feminists by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. These books all tend to be short, around a fiver, presented in handy A6 format and yet are handsome, giftable hardbacks. They sell, as a rule, by the boatload. Joining this august lineup is Katherine Rundell, with a 50-page essay: Why You Should Read Children\u2019s Books, Even Though You Are So Old and Wise. Her thesis is clear and familiar \u2013 she finds that when she tells people she\u2019s an author of children\u2019s books, she\u2019s greeted with \u201croughly the same smile I\u2019d expect had I told them I made miniature bathroom furniture out of matchboxes, for the elves\u201d. This is another chapter in the genre wars, where writers of what Amitav Ghosh calls the \u201cgeneric outhouses\u201d \u2013 sci-fi, crime, thriller, YA and children\u2019s literature \u2013 complain that their work is not held in the regard reserved for literary fiction. Most of the arguments in this realm are axiomatic to the point of meaninglessness \u2013 all but the most fanatical literary hardliners accept that such generic boundaries are endlessly porous and that there are as many great genre novels as there are terrible works of literary fiction published each year. Rundell\u2019s argument is both more subtle and more interesting, though. There\u2019s something particular about children\u2019s fiction, she says, that can open up new perspectives for adults. The best children\u2019s fiction \u201chelps us refind things we may not even know we have lost\u201d, taking us back to a time when \u201cnew discoveries came daily and when the world was colossal, before the imagination was trimmed and neatened\u2026\u201d There\u2019s also something instructive in reading books that, as Rundell points out, are \u201cspecifically written to be read by a section of society without political or economic power\u201d. In an age whose political ructions are the result of widespread frustration at the powerlessness of the many in the face of the few, this recognition of how emboldening and subversive children\u2019s books can be feels important. Rundell notes that the best children\u2019s novels operate on two planes, one of which caters to the traditional expectations of plot and jeopardy that young readers bring to books, another, reflecting the adult writer\u2019s consciousness at play in the novel, brings something darker: \u201cacknowledgments of fear, love, failure; of the rat that lives in the human heart\u201d. It reminds us of WH Auden\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere are good books which are only for adults, because their comprehension presupposes adult experiences, but there are no good books which are only for children.\u201d My own kids are of an age \u2013 11 and nine \u2013 when they have long set off on their own literary journeys, encouraged by friends, teachers and librarians. Once a week, though, I read to them aloud, partly because I think it\u2019s the best thing a family can do together, partly (mostly, and selfishly) because it allows me both to revisit old favourites \u2013 The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, The Dark Is Rising, A Wizard of Earthsea and A Wrinkle in Time. More recently, though, my children have been recommending their own books for us to read.

Nevertheless, both Jambeck and Koldewey are hopeful that the data they collect will make a positive difference, as the National Geographic team are focusing on building solutions and filling gaps with local and national partners and creating long-term change. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to demonise plastic \u2013 it has a huge role in society \u2013 but when you look at the impact of its waste, when there\u2019s no infrastructure to deal with it or the infrastructure is weak, it is causing huge consequences, whether that\u2019s on people, animals, wildlife or the health of the river system,\u201d said Koldewey. \u201cHaving worked on plastic pollution for many years, what\u2019s encouraging for me is seeing in the last two or three years a real groundswell of movement. It really feels like there is now energy and time for change, as there is ambition at the top levels of government, and that enables many groups to make change themselves.\u201d",

As the climate crisis continues to drive people away from rural areas and into cities, urbanisation has become a growing issue across the globe.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The Guardian's Global development team travelled to&nbsp; Africa's biggest slum, Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya, in an effort to look beyond the stereotypes and myths of life in a slum.</p>\n    <p>Many people living in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kibera.org.uk/facts-info/\">Kibera</a>&nbsp;work hard, long days. They pay high rents for flimsy shacks on land owned by the government and effectively squatted on by landlords. They have no services and the only taxation comes in the form of protection money demanded by police and gangs. Each day is a struggle to scrape together enough money and food to reach the next.</p>\n    <p>Electricity, clean water, toilets, healthcare and schools are either non-existent or not available to all residents. At any one time, 50% of Kibera's 15- to 25-year-old women are pregnant. Abortion is illegal and contraception scarce. Rape and child sex abuse is endemic. Abuse of drink and drugs is rife. Food is cheap but unhealthy \u2013 fizzy drinks are easier to get than clean water.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Three of four offer unpackaged medication from under the counter. The price in Kenyan schillings is equivalent to \u00a340 and in Kibera people earn 78p a day. There\u2019s no questions asked and most definitely no guarantees. \u201cHe told me to take two and insert two,\u201d says Ochieng, a dubious dosage according to the pharmaceutical company whose name is just visible.</p> \n<p>In a less anarchic world, the pills the feminist campaigner has bought would be part of a medically prescribed course to encourage the bleeding out of very early pregnancies. In Kibera they are illegally traded alongside a hotchpotch of herbal concoctions, chlorine and other chemicals girls swallow or push inside their bodies, hoping the terrible, life-defining pregnancy will go away. Usually it doesn\u2019t, often it ends up leaving women in agony, sometimes it kills them.</p> \n<p>In June, an attempt by the Federation of Women Lawyer\u2019s Kenya to compel health workers to provide safe legal abortion failed despite a report being presented that showed seven women a day were dying as a result of unsafe abortions, and that health spending on care following illegal abortions has doubled since 2012.</p> \n<p>There is nowhere for women to go except to quacks, says Ochieng, who leads a tiny<em> \u201c</em>Feminists for peace, rights and justice\u201d<em> </em>group that organises \u201crescues\u201d of women and children being subjected to physical or sexual violence, often in the middle of the night. \u201cWe are the brigades, rescuing women and arresting the men. The police do not come in here, so we do what police should do. Perpetrators are all around in the slum.</p> \n<p>\u201cI experienced rape for the first time when I was six. The perpetrator still lives there,\u201d she says, pointing to a shack a few feet from her own rusty mud-walled home. \u201cPeople here have normalised rape. They call any girl who falls pregnant when she is not married a bad girl, even though there is no way she can get contraception. Yet nobody talks about abortion, because it\u2019s shameful. So I talk about it and they call me \u2018murderer\u2019 when I walk in the street.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nairobi is the economic heart, accounting for <a href=\"http://mirror.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=4219&amp;catid=206&amp;typeid=13\">45% of </a><a href=\"http://mirror.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=4219&amp;catid=206&amp;typeid=13\">the gross domestic product</a> of a country approaching middle-income status. Two-thirds of the capital\u2019s residents live in slums; the largest is Kibera, with between 250,000 and 1 million people. It is encircled by a manicured golf course and elegant hotels, and divided by a filthy, plastic-choked river that brings in pollution from Nairobi\u2019s industries.</p> \n<p>The slum has a floor of orange mud, hard-layered detritus that slips between slime and dust, and the air lines throats and chests with the fumes of waste and fires.</p> \n<p>Ash confetti from charcoal cooking fires floats everywhere in a breeze that stirs the bottomless soup pot of Kibera\u2019s bad smells. Ochieng calls it \u201cKibera snow\u201d.</p> \n<p>Life is hard and health is poor, the life expectancy just 30 years. Diabetes rates are high from sugary drinks, which are cheaper than water. Vegetables are scarce: a nurse tells the Guardian that sukuma wiki, a cheap, nutritious kale, has been giving people stomach complaints; she blamed pollution in irrigation water. Charcoal or gas is used for cooking inside, and burns are commonplace on women\u2019s faces and arms.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b6c230dc7ebdea3f2c114c9289dbc5d01a770e2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b6c230dc7ebdea3f2c114c9289dbc5d01a770e2/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Men drink changaa \u2013 home-brewed alcohol \u2013 in a bar in Kibera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men drink changaa \u2013 home-brewed alcohol \u2013 in a bar in Kibera.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Drug and alcohol abuse fuels the gender violence, child abuse and rape.

      "bodyText": "Editar Ochieng sashays up in her \u201cThis is what a feminist looks like\u201d T-shirt \u2013 bright and new in a place where clothes are aged and faded. \u201cGot them,\u201d she stage-whispers, a flash of silver foil in her hand. Four pills carefully cut from a longer strip. Ochieng has just been attempting to buy abortion pills from among the numerous kiosk-sized \u201cquack\u201d chemists in the Nairobi slum of Kibera. Just to show how easy it is. Three of four offer unpackaged medication from under the counter. The price in Kenyan schillings is equivalent to \u00a340 and in Kibera people earn 78p a day. There\u2019s no questions asked and most definitely no guarantees. \u201cHe told me to take two and insert two,\u201d says Ochieng, a dubious dosage according to the pharmaceutical company whose name is just visible. In a less anarchic world, the pills the feminist campaigner has bought would be part of a medically prescribed course to encourage the bleeding out of very early pregnancies. In Kibera they are illegally traded alongside a hotchpotch of herbal concoctions, chlorine and other chemicals girls swallow or push inside their bodies, hoping the terrible, life-defining pregnancy will go away. Usually it doesn\u2019t, often it ends up leaving women in agony, sometimes it kills them. In June, an attempt by the Federation of Women Lawyer\u2019s Kenya to compel health workers to provide safe legal abortion failed despite a report being presented that showed seven women a day were dying as a result of unsafe abortions, and that health spending on care following illegal abortions has doubled since 2012. There is nowhere for women to go except to quacks, says Ochieng, who leads a tiny \u201cFeminists for peace, rights and justice\u201d group that organises \u201crescues\u201d of women and children being subjected to physical or sexual violence, often in the middle of the night. \u201cWe are the brigades, rescuing women and arresting the men. The police do not come in here, so we do what police should do. Perpetrators are all around in the slum. \u201cI experienced rape for the first time when I was six. The perpetrator still lives there,\u201d she says, pointing to a shack a few feet from her own rusty mud-walled home. \u201cPeople here have normalised rape. They call any girl who falls pregnant when she is not married a bad girl, even though there is no way she can get contraception. Yet nobody talks about abortion, because it\u2019s shameful. So I talk about it and they call me \u2018murderer\u2019 when I walk in the street.\u201d Nairobi is the economic heart, accounting for 45% of the gross domestic product of a country approaching middle-income status. Two-thirds of the capital\u2019s residents live in slums; the largest is Kibera, with between 250,000 and 1 million people. It is encircled by a manicured golf course and elegant hotels, and divided by a filthy, plastic-choked river that brings in pollution from Nairobi\u2019s industries. The slum has a floor of orange mud, hard-layered detritus that slips between slime and dust, and the air lines throats and chests with the fumes of waste and fires. Ash confetti from charcoal cooking fires floats everywhere in a breeze that stirs the bottomless soup pot of Kibera\u2019s bad smells. Ochieng calls it \u201cKibera snow\u201d. Life is hard and health is poor, the life expectancy just 30 years. Diabetes rates are high from sugary drinks, which are cheaper than water. Vegetables are scarce: a nurse tells the Guardian that sukuma wiki, a cheap, nutritious kale, has been giving people stomach complaints; she blamed pollution in irrigation water. Charcoal or gas is used for cooking inside, and burns are commonplace on women\u2019s faces and arms. Drug and alcohol abuse fuels the gender violence, child abuse and rape. Slums, where a billion of the world\u2019s population currently live, offer little security for women and children. The conditions also give rise to a community cohesion and spirit. Joyce Nyabswe is a grandmother, a vegetable seller, and a Marie Stopes community health volunteer. She has been walking around today, talking to young women, leafleting the clinic\u2019s open days. Marie Stopes, the international family planning charity, was briefly closed down last year by the Kenyan authorities for allegedly appearing to promote abortion. But the organisation still has two small offices inside Kibera where contraception and post-abortion care are offered. Refusing a chair and plopping herself with a sigh on the floor, Nyabswe says: \u201cI really feel that we are losing so many girls and young women. You can\u2019t miss the girls dying every month in our community. So I did this work, we are not paid, it\u2019s a volunteer job.\u201d Pamela Dochieng, a Marie Stopes midwife, shows her a photo of a healthy baby abandoned here the day before. \u201cWe called the baby Baracka Labour \u2013 gift of Labour Day,\u201d she says. The mother had turned up in the late stages of labour but ran off when Dochieng went to wash the newborn. \u201cEvery three or four days this happens,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very normal in this community, very common. They are going to quacks and the abortion doesn\u2019t work or they become ill. \u201cThey are very scared because of the ban. Yesterday this was never a pregnancy that she wanted to keep.

More than half of so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/20180205/alt-right-killing-people\">alt-right killers</a>\u201d are motivated by the \u201cwhite replacement\u201d theory, which refers to the belief that white people will be systematically replaced by black and brown migrants. The killer in El Paso, who law enforcement believes authored the memo, is apparently no exception.</p> <p>The white replacement theory is actually made up of two sub-conspiracies: \u201cthe great replacement\u201d theory, which originated in France, and \u201cthe white genocide theory\u201d, which comes from the US. Together, the theories are among the most widespread ideologies in far-right spaces, and the primary catalysts of far-right mass violence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/04/el-paso-safe-city-white-man-killing-latinos\">El Paso loses its 'safe city' title \u2013 not from migrants, but a white man killing Latinos | Ed Vulliamy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The great replacement can generally be understood as two core beliefs. The first is that \u201cwestern\u201d identity is under siege by massive waves of immigration from non-European/non-white countries, resulting in a replacement of white European individuals via demographics. The second is that replacement has been orchestrated by a shadowy group as part of their grand plan to rule the world \u2013 which they will do by creating a completely racially homogenous society. This group is often overtly identified as being Jews, but sometimes the antisemitism is more implicit.</p> <p>These beliefs have proliferated in mass killer texts for the past eight years. They are generally understood as having begun with Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass shooter whose 1,500-page manifesto expressed a fear of white ethnic replacement by migrants from the Middle East and North Africa. This same fear cropped up in the manifestos of several more mass killers in Europe, before making its way to the rambling screed published by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/multiple-fatalities-gunman-christchurch-mosque-shooting\">Christchurch shooter</a>, which was titled The Great Replacement. The Christchurch manifesto begins with: \u201cIt\u2019s the birthrates. It\u2019s the birthrates. It\u2019s the birthrates.\u201d It was directly inspired by Breivik \u2013 and he, in turn, inspired the El Paso shooter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dfb077c97fd93010eeed4649e03741b9fc7e494\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dfb077c97fd93010eeed4649e03741b9fc7e494/0_92_3336_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rene Aguilar and Jackie Flores pray at a makeshift memorial for the victims of Saturday\u2019s mass shooting at a shopping complex in El Paso, Texas, 4 August 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rene Aguilar and Jackie Flores pray at a makeshift memorial for the victims of Saturday\u2019s mass shooting at a shopping complex in El Paso, Texas, on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Leighton/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The El Paso shooter begins his text by writing: \u201cIn general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThis attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d Those were the words that appeared in a manifesto published shortly before the deadly shooting in El Paso on Saturday. More than half of so-called \u201calt-right killers\u201d are motivated by the \u201cwhite replacement\u201d theory, which refers to the belief that white people will be systematically replaced by black and brown migrants. The killer in El Paso, who law enforcement believes authored the memo, is apparently no exception. The white replacement theory is actually made up of two sub-conspiracies: \u201cthe great replacement\u201d theory, which originated in France, and \u201cthe white genocide theory\u201d, which comes from the US. Together, the theories are among the most widespread ideologies in far-right spaces, and the primary catalysts of far-right mass violence. The great replacement can generally be understood as two core beliefs. The first is that \u201cwestern\u201d identity is under siege by massive waves of immigration from non-European/non-white countries, resulting in a replacement of white European individuals via demographics. The second is that replacement has been orchestrated by a shadowy group as part of their grand plan to rule the world \u2013 which they will do by creating a completely racially homogenous society. This group is often overtly identified as being Jews, but sometimes the antisemitism is more implicit. These beliefs have proliferated in mass killer texts for the past eight years. They are generally understood as having begun with Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass shooter whose 1,500-page manifesto expressed a fear of white ethnic replacement by migrants from the Middle East and North Africa. This same fear cropped up in the manifestos of several more mass killers in Europe, before making its way to the rambling screed published by the Christchurch shooter, which was titled The Great Replacement. The Christchurch manifesto begins with: \u201cIt\u2019s the birthrates. It\u2019s the birthrates. It\u2019s the birthrates.\u201d It was directly inspired by Breivik \u2013 and he, in turn, inspired the El Paso shooter. The El Paso shooter begins his text by writing: \u201cIn general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto. This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas. They are the instigators, not me. I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion.\u201d Despite is recent proliferation, the great replacement theory was first popularized decades ago in the 1973 novel Le Camp des Saints (The Camp of the Saints) by Jean Raspail \u2013 a vastly influential book in contemporary white supremacist discourse. In this work of speculative fiction, Raspail paints an apocalyptic picture of the complete collapse of all western society and culture stemming from a \u201ctidal wave\u201d of immigration from the \u201cthird world\u201d.

Although it tried to play down the significance of \u201cbreaking seven\u201d, the move was seen as highly significant by analysts after years of the PBOC trying to build up the currency so it can take what Beijing sees as its rightful place among the world\u2019s leading currencies. \u201cThe fact that they have now stopped defending 7.00 against the dollar suggests that they have all but abandoned hopes for a trade deal with the US,\u201d said Julian Evans Pritchard of Capital Economics. He added that by linking the devaluation with Trump\u2019s renewed tariff threat, \u201cthe PBOC has effectively weaponised the exchange rate\u201d. El Kaku, a currency strategist at Nomura in Tokyo, said: \u201cIt is not surprising if Beijing thinks they should weaken the yuan to negotiate with Trump when the US side is maxing out on tariffs. We expect the yuan to weaken to 7.2 this quarter.\u201d However, not all observers agreed China had deliberately started to devalue the yuan in order to hit back at Trump, with some arguing that it was market pressure on many Asian currencies that had proved hard to resist. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to infuriate Trump any further,\u201d said Cliff Tan of MUFG in Hong Kong. \u201cWe are seeing strong sell-off pressures in the Korean won which is quite sensitive to the Sino-US trade war. The Taiwanese dollar is falling sharply, too.\u201d Uncertainty in the region also increased thanks to protests in Hong Kong that appeared to be building into more widespread civil disobedience and disruption of the financial hubs economy. Asian share markets were a sea of red with Japan\u2019s Nikkei shedding 2.3% to the lowest since early June. It was the sharpest daily drop since March and led Japanese officials to call a special meeting to discuss market turmoil. Australian shares slipped about 1.5% to spend their fourth straight session in the red, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi tumbled 2.1% to hit its lowest since December 2016. But the biggest losses were seen in Hong Kong where the Hang Seng index was off 3% at 4.30am GMT after the city\u2019s chief executive warned that it was heading towards a \u201cvery dangerous situation\u201d. The rush to sell shares meant that bond yields rose as investors opted to place money in government treasuries. Gold also rose while oil extended losses with Brent down 35c at $61.54.",

Lose there, and you\u2019re out of the competition entirely. This format means that Grand Finals always consists of one fighter who has won every single one of their matches, and one fighter who has only lost one of their matches, which in turn means that the competitor who came out of the Loser\u2019s bracket needs to win twice in order to take the title \u2013 to \u2018reset the bracket\u2019 first and equalise the score.</p> <p>With thousands of entrants in most of the tournaments, whittling down the field to just 8 competitors is a long and involved process that takes literal days, with players fighting their way out of pools (small mini-tournaments) and maintaining winning streaks that will keep them advancing to the next round of competition. Pools are usually seeded by player\u2019s region of origin, with players less likely to face familiar opponents until higher in the bracket, and only if their own skills have let them advance that far. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d473c978f08c7e177d44969\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-04T20:16:13.318Z\">9.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Looks like we\u2019re on break for a hot moment while the Evo streaming crew scramble to fix their overlays, which mysteriously went missing during that last set.

One reason is the completely open format of the various tournaments: if you can physically turn up to Las Vegas and pay the entry fee, you have a shot of making it all the way to the top. Contestants travel from all over the world to play at Evo, with winners in recent years from Japan, Sweden, South Korea and the UK, though the bulk of players are based out of North America.<br></p> <p>Fighting games in general have a somewhat rugged reputation in terms of production values and especially prize pool, which even at Evo \u2013 the biggest FCG event of them all \u2013 sits in the tens of thousands of dollars (compared to the almost-regular million dollar tournaments for games like League of Legends and Fortnite).

Will we see it? Yes we will. We are all free now! And with that, thank you for joining our experimental coverage of this year\u2019s exhausting, exhilarating, ridiculously fun video game tournament. Thank you for playing. Grand Finals (Reset): MKLeo 2: Tweek 0: We\u2019re in a reverse of the earlier situation now without the benefit of a bracket reset filler, Tweek definitely on the backfoot and Leo still asserting his dominance until Tweek finally lands a heavy Charizard hit and takes the first stock. Tweek still up one stock after 2 minutes but Leo jumps down and hits a reflect to send Charizard off-screen, 2:2. Match still even after another minute but Arsense catches Charizard napping on a edgeguard and sends him on his way again. If Tweek can\u2019t figure this out here\u2019s gone - Leo dancing with death at 172% damage - nuked offscreen with a heavy Chrizard slash again to put it at 1:1, but Squirtle\u2019s at 101 % on one stock left - Leo waiting in centre-stage, trying to bait Tweek in so Leo can fully convert to the tournament point takedown - an unsafe Change nearly sends Charizard off-stage but he survives with good DI, but it\u2019s too much, he can\u2019t take it, he can\u2019t keep up this offence and Leo lands a Arsene-powered spike to blast Tweek\u2019s final stock into the depths. MKLeo is your Super Smash Brothers Ultimate Evo 2019 Champion! Grand Finals (Reset): MKLeo 1: Tweek 0: It\u2019s a strange thing to say when half the time both competitors are around equal on damage and stock but it\u2019s beginning to feel like Tweek has been downloaded. Tweek\u2019s down 2:1, nearly eats it after a bad Pokemon change right in front of Joker but just barely survives. Manages to backthrow Leo off stage but is almost immedately punished on respawn. Arsene\u2019s out, lifts Ivysaur off-screen above, edgeguards effectively - MKLeo 2: Tweek 0. Grand Finals (Reset): MKLeo 0: Tweek 0: We\u2019re back, back again, at 0:0 and Leo continues his dominance, taking the first stock early in. Tweek matches a moment later, both at 2:2 again, with damage difference - Tweek manages to switch but SDs almost immediately after after getting tinged by Joker\u2019s guns mid up-b. We\u2019re down to 1:1 but Tweek is at 131% damage, needs something crazy to take Leo out in this first reset set, tries to pull of a crazy move and hit Joker off-screen with a wild flare blitz but SDs immediately. No payout, MKLeo 1: Tweek 0. Grand Finals: MKLeo 2: Tweek 2: Tweek\u2019s at tournament point but MKLeo can rest the bracket at any moment, the tension is palpable. Leo reads another Pokemon change and punishes immediately, taking the first stock at the minute mark. Is Tweek running out of momentum? It happens again, mid-air changeover read immediately, punished for it by Leo who has stock advantage 2:1. Arsene\u2019s out, takes out the Pokemon switch again, Leo resets the bracket! Grand Finals: MKLeo 1: Tweek 2: Another even start, Tweek surviving Arsense\u2019s entire duration to take the first stock with a Charizard hit at 1 minute in - suddenly he\u2019s up two stock against Leo\u2019s Joker, then one stock - Squirtle combos doing good but Leo reads a Pokemon switch, times the forward air and equalises the stock! This turnabout! Ivysaur can\u2019t make it back onto the stage against Joker\u2019s quality edgeguarding - goes for a spike - Ivysaur lands with a back air, but the heavy trade comes out advantageous for MKLeo, who survives another day - we\u2019re at game 5! MKleo 2: Tweek 2. Grand Finals: MKLeo 0: Tweek 2: So far so good for Leo, effectively blunting Tweek\u2019s heavy momentum, catches a flare blitz with a forward smash and doing OK but a sudden vine whip from Ivysaur evens the damage up, both at massive damage 5 minutes in until Leo finally converts. Tweek matches a minute later and we\u2019re back to nearly even trades, both at 2 stock and comparable damage, Joker has Arsene out, catches Charizard with a counter then a back air and takes the stock. Ivy puts Leo in the air with a throw, down 90% damage but still only a match away from a Grand Finals win - can he do it now? Leo is looking dominant again and Tweek just can\u2019t convert, looks frustrated, and loses the set - Leo takes it to game 4 - MKLeo 1: Tweek 2. Grand Finals: MKLeo 0: Tweek 1: Leo tries to edguard and is spiked as punishment and loses a stock, but it\u2019s evened right back in, 1 stock down each within a minute - pretty much the story of this whole match, I think it\u2019s safe to say, at least to date. Tweek with the reads, Leo rolling into Tweek and Tweek punishes him for it with ease, up one stock and 80% damage at 5 minutes, can he clutch it out? Leo\u2019s on the defensive, still playing at his high calibur but he just can\u2019t make it through Tweek\u2019s impossible reads! MKLeo 0: Tweek 2! Here we go folks - the very last match of Evo 2019, Tweek\u2019s Pokemon Trainer vs MKLeo\u2019s domineering Joker, Leo with disadvantage needing to reset the bracket first. Tweek takes Leo out with a spike 40 seconds in, a surprising result for the quick-moving Joker, but Leo catches Ivysaur in some kind of repeat combo but can\u2019t convert into a a kill until 30 seconds in. 1:1 each. Combo from Tweek\u2019s Squirtle nearly equalises the damage, Tweek gives up stage control and eats a stock loss but gets it back almost instantly - what a close match! Squirtle definitely giving MKLeo the closest run this whole Top 8 - switches to Charizard, edgeguards the hell out of Leo, launches up off the screen! Tweek 1: MKLeo 0. Losers Finals: Glutonny 0: MKLeo 1: Leo takes Glutonny\u2019s first stock down 1 minute in, but he returns the favour a few seconds later, so both players sitting on 2 stock and 0 damage for a hot second. Leo mixup catches Glutonny by surprise, takes a stock, Glutonny puts up a fight but gets knocked out with another up-B despite a good recovery and up-air. Game 2 goes Glutonny 0: MKLeo 2. Insane game happening off the edge below the stage, Glutonny trying to escape to the left side of the stage from the right - he succeeds but Leo catches him before he can find his bearings and takes the first stock. Dash attack from Wario takes Leo\u2019s first stock but he chases him down again, removes the second stock for 2:1 Leo advantage. Bike trades - chasedown - Glutonny back to edgeguarding and doing a pretty good job, but no, he can\u2019t make it in the end, MKLeo just keeping the pressure too high - MKLeo is going to Grand Finals, Glutonny out at third place. Losers Finals: Glutonny v MKLeo: Just two more matches remaining before we\u2019re all freed from this torment of hype. Oops, another accidental button press on setup, so double SDs to get back to the menu. Glutonny\u2019s Wario vs Leo\u2019s Joker, Leo\u2019s been cutting through the Loser\u2019s bracket to date, can he slice his way all to Grand Finals? Thirty seconds in and it was looking tricky, but Glutonny accidentally walks off and goes down a stock despite equalising early on. Wastes a waft and Leo punishes, gets a good off-stage projectile eat but dies to a Leo combo, chased down, and gets hit with an up-b: Glutonny 0: Mkleo 1. I am so glad that was a shorter set because who knows how much longer I can hold out. Here\u2019s the climax of the insane Winner\u2019s Finals that saw Tweek finally make it all the way to Grand Finals. Losers Semifinals: Samsora v MKLeo: As Coney notes on commentary, Japan has been eliminated, so it\u2019s just USA Samsora (Peach) vs Mexico\u2019s MKLeo (Joker) in a best of three set to face Glutonny in Loser\u2019s finals. Peach down a stock one minute in doing their best to zone with turnips but can\u2019t quite catch MKLeo, who tries to chase down with Arsense out and eats a Peach back-air to lose a stock. Samsora whiffs twice and gets punished for it, down a stock again, pushed to the far ledge on the right, chased by MKLeo and bites it. Samsora 0: MKLeo 1. Good edgeguarding by Samsora sees Leo lose a stock 1 min 20s in, taking an early lead, Samsora surviving a Leo chasedown before finally losing a stock of his own, waiting out Arsene and Joker. Leo tries to rebel charge off a crown but it\u2019s too much - he loses his second stock and Samsora still has advantage for the moment - but not too long, stock equalises, only 60% damage defecit, and then MKLeo converts finally, blunting Samsora\u2019s momentum and taking the set and the match. Samsora eliminated, MKLeo proceeds to Loser\u2019s Finals. Winner\u2019s Finals: Glutonny 2: Tweek 2: Finally off Pokemon Stadium 2, can Tweek make it back from the edge? Tournament point for both players, we\u2019ve been going back and forth for 17 minutes now. Tweek finally gets Wario out down a stock, switches back to Squirtle, playing a much safer game though he can\u2019t make it through Wario covering himself with the bike. Seismic toss doesn\u2019t take out Glutonny but an Ivysaur forward-air nukes Glutonny, stock at 2:1, advantage Tweek. Charizard too slow, saves himself with flare blitz twice but can\u2019t keep it up, 1:1 stock, an insane breath-taking set of close play sees Tweek finally take it, Tweek\u2019s headed to Grand Finals and Glutonny is going to Losers. Winner\u2019s Finals: Glutonny 1: Tweek 2: We\u2019re still on Pokemon Stadium 2. Tweek loses a stock to a successful edgeguard at 1 minute down, nearly SDs beneath the stage but swaps to Charizard, recovers, and equalises the stock. Both playing off stage, Glutonny chasing down Tweek and tossing, but he\u2019s still got a waft charged - Glutonny wastes the waft against Tweek\u2019s shield, who reads the usage perfectly - but Glutonny\u2019s still up an entire stock - dash attack takes him out, did game 3 get too far inside Tweek\u2019s mind? Glutonny 2: Tweek 2. Winner\u2019s Finals: Glutonny 0: Tweek 2: Tweek down a stock a minute in, rare lead for Glutonny, but equalised a mere 15 seconds later. Parry lets Wario get significant damage in but they still remain roughly equal, Tweek rolls into a punt, ends up down 1 stock at 5 minutes remaining on the clock. Picks up with a vine whip to remove Glutonny\u2019s edge guard and recovers with Charizard, but he\u2019s still got a 100% damage defecit, though making up ground quickly with Ivysaur - suddenly the momentum is strong but Glutonny defends succesfully through an insane set of trades - Glutonny lives! Glutonny 1: Tweek 2: Winner\u2019s Finals: Glutonny v Tweek: Little bit of fun to start with as a mispress means both players self-destruct to get back to the stage and character select, Glutonny\u2019s Wario vs Tweek\u2019s Pokemon Trainer. Wario\u2019s gone within the first 1 and a half minutes to a heavy Charizard, briefly huge advantage to Tweek 3:1 before dropping to a slightly more managable 2:1. It\u2019s not enough though, Ivysaur blasting Wario off again, Glutonny 0: Tweek 1. This set is 3/5, so be prepped for a longer run. Second set starts strong and slightly more even, no losses yet at 1 and a half minutes in though the damage is high before heavy Charizard throw eliminates Glutonny\u2019s first stock, though he matches it 20 seconds later. Both of them go deep below the stage, but Wario\u2019s keeping his waft safe then punishes with it to take Tweek\u2019s second stock. Suddenly we\u2019re down 1-1, only 30% separating the two players - Glutonny getting good at punishing the Pokemon switches - but he eats a Charizard b-air to the face and gets tossed. Glutonny 0: Tweek 2. Losers Quarterfinals 2: Raito v MKLeo: Can Raito\u2019s Duck Hunt Duo take out the MKLeo\u2019s Joker, the number one player in the world? it seems unlikely but crazier things have happened on the grand stage. Smashville is up again, both players vaguely zoning-based, Raito back on the space control kick - staredown over the can, both of them at 170% damage 2 minutes on the clock still with 3 stock until a sudden trade, both down a stock. It\u2019s zone vs zone with neither able to get in, both just looking for mistakes, neither with a clear advantage until Leo\u2019s powered-up normals make the difference. Leo\u2019s grapple recovery saves him twice from going deep beneath the stage until he gets caught by a good can, but still 70% damage up on even stock 1:1. Finally a low back-air catches Duck Hunt and tosses them, MKLeo 1: Raito 0. My god, I turned away for 20 seconds and Leo already eliminated a stock somehow. What the heck? Leo looking pretty right now, edgeguarding even without Arsene out, Raito down 1:3 - insane odds in Top 8. Can he get in? It\u2019ll be the comeback of the year, both at 120% damage but at a 2 stock defecit - he gets a stock in, then commentator\u2019s curse hits immediately, Duck Hunt hitting the screen. MKLeo into Loser\u2019s finals, Raito eliminated. Rest in peace doggo. Losers Quarterfinals 1: Samsora 1 | Protobanhan 1: We\u2019re back to Battlefield and roughly equal one minute into the match. I\u2019ve never seen Peach played at this speed - even game, one stock each, 5% damage seperating the two - we\u2019re at tournament point - Peach\u2019s lockdown is impressive, and finally catches Protobanham\u2019s Lucina at the last moment, and that\u2019s Protobanhan eliminated at 5th place - Samsora advancing to Losers Semi-Finals. Losers Quarterfinals 1: Samsora v Protobanham: Six matches left to go and we\u2019ve got Samsora\u2019s Peach up against the aforementioned Protobanhan\u2019s scary-fast Lucina - it\u2019s a bad matchup for the floaty Peach, but let\u2019s see if there\u2019s any surprises here. By the way, did you see that Smash 4 footage during the break? My god, Ultimate looks so fast compared to the Wii U version. Anyway let\u2019s get to the set. We\u2019re on Battlefield again and it\u2019s dead even half a minute in, Samsora doing good to approach despite Lucy\u2019s swords, suddenly tech into back air and Samsora\u2019s down a stock. Peach keeps chasing down, follows up and launches successfully and they\u2019re back equal, 2 stocks each and fairly comparable damage. Back on stage dolphin slash picks up Peach after a long recovery for both of them and sends her flying, Samsora down one stock - equalises with a back air attack - Proto\u2019s edgeguarding successfully and consistently but can\u2019t quite eliminate Samsora - until it happens one too many times and knocks Samsora out, Samsora 0: Protobanham 1. Phew, what a set. Samsora starts out strong, dealing 60% damage in the first 10 seconds and maintains the damage lead for nearly a minute, but Protobanham chases and reads a predictable recovery at 90% to get the stock lead early on. The situation reverses, Peach edgeguarding for a moment before Protobanham recover, both players sitting on high damage and 2 stock each - finally Peach flies too close to the side and Lucina capitlaises. Peach bomber catches Lucina quickly after the refresh, takes the damage lead - can Samsora pull it back? Yes, he does it - smart edgeguard reads, those last 20 seconds, beautiful play. Samsora 1: Protobanham 1. For serious, Protobanhan\u2019s Lucina is absolutely terrifying. Look at this play. Losers Round 2: MkLeo v Zackray: MKLeo\u2019s Joker takes on Zackray\u2019s Wolf, both fast characters again on Pokemon Stadium 2. Joker\u2019s normally quite dependent on Arsene but Leo is making him look competitive even without the Persona out, though it\u2019s looking fairly even here, Zackray chasing out Leo until a smart mid-air counter sends him flying. He just won\u2019t stop chasing, which turns out bad for him when he gets sent below the stage, Leo\u2019s tether recovery saving it for him: MKLeo 1: Zackray 0. Set two starts fairly similarly, a powered up Joker tossing Wolf before being quickly removed himself. Leo up a stock though the damage is near equal - a smart up-B from MKLeo removes Zackray from competition. Zackray eliminated. Losers Round 1: ProtoBanham vs Light: Protobanham\u2019s Lucina vs Light\u2019s Fox and Fox is already down a stock mere moments into this match on Smashville. No zoning or projectile shenanigans here, clean chases between two quick, fast characters. Lucina clips Fox to finish off at the end there - what a incredibly fast match! Protobanham 1: Light 0. Double KO moments into the second round as Protobanham chases Light beneath the stage, successfully knocks them out but then self-destructs unable to recover back to the stage. A half minute later Light gets launched at fairly low damage and is punished for it, losing a stock quickly - dramatic flurry of moves before Protobanham does it again beneath the stage, but since it\u2019s the last stock Light dies first and hands Protobanham the victory. Protobanham eliminates Light. Winner\u2019s Semifinal 2: Tweek v Samsora: Two top 5s in the world here meeting in Winners Semis, Tweek number 2 on the planet and Samsora number 4, on the Panda Global Rankings. Should be a good match, Tweek\u2019s Pokemon Trainer vs Samsora\u2019s Peach, on good old basic Battlefield. Samsora down at 100% of damage compared to Ivysaur\u2019s 22% early on, heavier Charizard getting in and tossing Peach off screen. It\u2019s the Charizard who gets the kills putting us at Tweek 1: Samsora 0. Smashville for our next stage, a bit smaller than Battlefield, Tweek utilising character switches to great effect, keeping it light to start combos getting back on the stage with unsafe air dodges - finally caught by Samsora, who punishes to finally take the first stock. But it\u2019s not long before Samsora is down one stock, and can\u2019t hold onto it for long - eventaully Tweek gets through, knocking Samsora into Losers. Winners Semifinal 1: Glutonny 1: Raito 1: These sets are 2 out of 3 for reasons of speed so it\u2019s match point for both competitors. We\u2019ve moved to Pokemon Stadium with transformations off now, still a wide stage, both competitors at roughly equal damage before Raito goes flying off screen. Finally another can lands on and takes Wario out, 2:2 at four minutes thirty. Glutonny is carefully trying to approach, avoiding the beans, picks Raito off a ledge recovery and hits him with a waft - bam, Raito\u2019s outta here. Glutonny heads into Winners Finals, Raito knocked into losers. Winners Semifinal 1: Glutonny v Raito: Gluttony\u2019s Wario v Raito\u2019s Duck Hunt on Town and City. Smash is of course a different type of fighting game than almost every other mainstage game in Evo, focused on damage buildup to launch enemies off stage. Raito\u2019s space control is strong with cans and gunslingers all over, both down a stock each after a minute off the clock, then down to 1:1 at 4 minutes remaining. Raito lands a late forward smash to knock Gluttony out, Glutonny 0: Raito 1. Second set goes roughly the same, Raito hanging on a 174% damage for a while with advantage before a bike hit takes him out. The projectile game is making it very difficult for Glutonny to jump in who finds himself down 2:1 at 3 min on the clock before a waft on uptilt kills at 47%! Suddenly the match evens out, only 40% difference with advantage to Glutonny before landing a flying foot to knock Raito out, Glutonny 1: Raito 1. Brackets! Brackets! I\u2019m not afraid to tell those of you still with us that I\u2019m beginning to melt down into a puddle of goo. Thank god for coffee. Your Top 8 for Smash Ultimate are: Winner\u2019s bracket Glutonny [France] Raito [Japan] Tweak [USA] Samsora [USA] Loser\u2019s Bracket ProtoBanham [JPN] Light [USA] MkLeo [Mexico] zackray [JPN] Can we all survive to the end? Who knows - though you should know in advance it\u2019s fairly unlikely Nintendo will have any announcements afterwards, so from here on in, it\u2019s all about the competition. It\u2019s real strange not having Street Fighter as the closer, but Smash had an unprecedented 3,492 entrants. It\u2019s time. Cinnpie and Coney on mic on stream. Let\u2019s go! Looks like Gematsu has the scoop on the latest Guilty Gear pics for next year... Here\u2019s the last lot of recaps. You can probably tell I\u2019m still losing steam - hopefully Smash can bring it back. Mortal Kombat 11 Gory, bloody and looking somewhat stiff next to its flashier competitors, MK11\u2019s first Evo appearance was decisively claimed by two-time Mortal Kombat X Evo champion Donique \u201cSonicFox\u201d McLean, apparently unphased from his earlier Top 8 appearance for DBZ, as he demolished Ryan \u201cDragon\u201d Walker 3-0. --- BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle The actual lowest number of participants and the smallest prize pool went to BBTag, but that didn\u2019t make the game any less hype, with Marvel-style shennanigans blunting against the defensive playstyle of eventual champion and one of three Americans in the top 8 Oscar \u201cShinku\u201d James, despite expectations of Japanese dominance. Check that out below. Daisuke Ishitawari of Arc System Works, best known as the creator of the Guilty Gear series, has turned up to announce something that they\u2019ve been working on - an entirely new Guilty Gear slated for 2020. As usual it looks stunning. While we wait for Smash to start up, let\u2019s take a look over a few more finals from Day 2. Dragonball FighterZ Story of the night was a runback (replay) of last year\u2019s grand finals which happened not once but twice, with last year\u2019s flamboyant champion Donique \u201cSonicFox\u201d McLean up against his perennial rival Goichi \u201cGO1\u201d Kishida. SonicFox\u2019s furious offence met Go1\u2019s implacable defence in a dramatic Winner\u2019s Finals and again in Grand Finals after Fox fought his way back out of the loser\u2019s bracket. Go1 burst into tears of happiness after finally defeating SonicFox, who hugged his victorious opponent in a grand display of sportsmanship. Definitely an Evo Moment, extremely anime. Other notables included the reappearance of infamous Marvel 3 player Christopher \u201cChrisG\u201d Gonzales as well as a good performance from Spanish newcomer Joan \u201cShanks\u201d Namay making it to Top 4. --- Samurai Shodown The venerable SNK game\u2019s return had a star lineup with the legendary Justin Wong showing up with safe play and Ryota \u201cKazunoko\u201d Inoue joining his second Top 8 (alongside his strong DBZ appearance earlier in the day). Long-term Evo veteran Alex \u201cCaliPower\u201d Valle had a glimpse at greatness with a clutch victory against Renato \u201cDidimoKOF\u201d Martins before eating a decisive loss in the Losers Quarterfinal against Reynard \u201cReynard\u201d Tacsuan. Still, it was the controversial Seon-woo \u201cInfiltration\u201d Lee, better known in the Street Fighter scene (though currently on hiatus due to domestic abuse allegations), who broke out of the loser\u2019s bracket to trounce Kazunoko 3-0 in the first set and 3-1 in the second. His victory unfortunately casts something of a cloud over a super interesting, very differently-paced type of fighting game. Tekken series director Harada has turned up, his shades firmly on to throw shade at Capcom\u2019s Yoshinori Ono, who didn\u2019t turn up after the Street Fighter finals, as well as a little at Evo for some early choppy video for the Soul Calibur announcements earlier in the evening. Did Harada really turn up to say \u201cno info to announce\u201d and wander back offstage? The answer... is no. Harada drops the date of the Tekken World Tour finals in Bangkok in December, then walks off stage, then back on stage for one more announcement. The ruses! The trickery! Here\u2019s a video - it\u2019s Tekken 7\u2019s season 3. New characters announced are returning character Zefina and a new original character, Leroy Smith, who looks like a New York take on Bruce Lee. Your Tekken Evo 2019 Champion, Arslan Ash. My heart is in my mouth as we go to the winner\u2019s ceremony and I\u2019ve still got another entire Top 8 left to go. We know Harada is in Las Vegas (and so is Ono) - they\u2019ve said that there\u2019s no announcements slated for Tekken, but can we really believe them? An amazing job for Arslan, who turned up out of nowhere to take Evo Japan and can now add an Evo championship to his list of achievements. Grand Finals: Arslan 2: Knee 2: We thought it was over, but Knee pulled it back from the edge, but he\u2019s still got a set to go before he can even reset the bracket. Arslan\u2019s got another chance. No character switching here, Arslan pulling off the first round with a steady set of safe moves. Trades go badly for Knee in the second round early, but converts a counter hit into a decent amount of damage, but with 11 seconds left on the clock Arslan clutches it out. We\u2019re back on tournament point and Arslan takes a commanding and aggressive lead - can Knee turn it around once more? Knee gets a flashpunch combo off a whiff but Arslan immediately jumps back into offence. 20 seconds left on the clock. Knee on rage, nearly takes it, but Arslan cements it with a heavy trade and takes out Knee decisively. Arslan Ash is your Evo 2019 Tekken Champion! Grand Finals: Arslan 2: Knee 1: If Arslan takes this set it\u2019s all over, Knee switching to Devil Jin - a higher tier character according to the books, but right now it\u2019s looking pretty good for Arslan no matter what character Knee chooses. Arslan takes round 1, Knee finally gets a good counterhit in in Round 2 and drops Arslan to three-quarters help in an instant, but his steady poke game pays off and puts Arslan at tournament point. Third round is almost a repeat of round 2, but Knee manages to pull it off this time, drops Arslan in round 3. Round 4 starts with a stone head and decent momentum for Knee, it goes down to seconds before Knee manages to penetrate Arlan\u2019s defences and equalise it all, 2-2. Knee\u2019s back on his game, Arslan\u2019s steady work not doing it for him this time - Knee pulls it off and takes the set! Grand Finals: Arslan 1: Knee 1: Arslan losening up and putting a round on the map as I blink, then taking the second round as well with a domineering performance. Knee gets back in for a hot second before Arslan pokes make it through once again, handing the set back to Arslan 2: Knee 1. Grand Finals: Arslan 1: Knee 0: Looking dangerous for Knee here who can only eat two more set losses before elimination. A furious footsie game results in Arslan clutching out a last second victory for round 1. Knee takes a lead in round 2 and manages to convert, strong blockstrings seeing a set of trades broken by Knee\u2019s last second grab, taking the third round as well. Knee, knocked down to low health, breaks through into a set of full damage Devil Kazuya combos to equalise the sets - Arslan 1: Knee 1. This is tight, folks, but as Markman and Aris remind us all, Knee has never beaten Arslan in competition to date - can he swing it here, at the very top? The runback! This meeting of Tekken legends already resulted in a crazy match early on in Winners Semi-Finals and we\u2019re returning to a runback of the battle of legends here at the pinnacle. It\u2019s all on the line as South Korea\u2019s Knee fights his way out of a tough Loser\u2019s bracket to face the Pakistani Prodigy, Arslan Ash, once more. The crowd is popping off as we head into the fight, Arslan sticking with Kazumi, Knee with Kazuya. Arslan takes a dominant position early on in round 1, drawing first blood, but Knee pulls out a super to punish a whiff and take the second round. Knee takes the third as well, summoning Devil Kazuya in round four but not managing to blunt Arslan\u2019s sudden onslought. It\u2019s 2-2 until Arslan traps Kazumya against a wall and juggle combos him to death, Arslan 1: Knee 0. Loser\u2019s finals: Anakin 1: Knee 0: Anakin closes in on Knee immediately in round 1 and again in round 2, an unbelievable run before Knee seems to wake up in Round 3 to stay competitive. A smart rage drive opens Anakin up, Knee charging in and throwing to finally get a game back, but Anakin takes the fourth round back with a juggle combo to take the second set, Anakin 2: Knee 0. Knee gets a few hits in early in the second set but Anakin retaliates, equalising the lifebars, then picks up Knee and goes completely ham to take round 1. A more cautious approach characterises the second round with throw escapes and footises finally solved by a crucial Paul rage art giving Knee the round win and the momentum to take the set, Anakin 2: Knee 1. Set three starts out strong for Knee with a dominant round 1 and then clutching out the second round with 2 seconds left on the clock. The third set goes to Knee as well, recovering decisively to bring up his score, Anakin 2: Knee 2. Knee\u2019s found his momentum now and it\u2019s looking fairly free - he\u2019s downloaded Anakin entirely and turns it around within moments. Knocks Anakin down and out into third place, Knee advancing to Winner\u2019s finals to face Arslan once again. Some kind of codec call is going on-stage but it hasn\u2019t shown up on stream - no doubt we\u2019ll find out about it later on. From 1900 competitors we\u2019re down to the Top 3 for Tekken 7. In Loser\u2019s finals, we have South Korea\u2019s Knee vs USA\u2019s Anakin for the chance to fight Pakinstan\u2019s Arslan who is waiting on the throne, having already tossed both of them out of the winner\u2019s bracket. Knee picks Paul, his first appearance in this top 8, while Anakin sticks to Jack. Knee takes an early lead, Anakin in the purple, and converts to take round 1. Anakin jams Knee against a wall quickly but Knee rolls out and nearly comes back before methodical work by Anakin puts him in the dirt in round 2. With 10 seconds left on the clock Anakin punishes a whiff and takes the third round, then finishes the last round with a perfect, Anakin 1: Knee 0. Just a couple of recaps while we\u2019re in break here from Day 1 and the beginning of Day 2. Soul Calibur 6 With nearly the lowest number of entrants \u2013 a still respectable 750 or so \u2013 SoulCal was up first on Friday. Marie-Laure \u201cKayane\u201d Norindr, one of the few women to make Top 8, put in a good performance but was eliminated early 2-0. Ultimately it was Yuta \u201cYuttuto\u201d Sudo who took the finals 2:1, fighting off Zain \u201cBluegod\u201d Tibeishat with a terrifying set of Voldo hipthrusts and mixups. Under Night In-Birth.exe: Late(ST) The phrase going around for UNIST, as the once-niche anime fighter is commonly known, is \u2018Cinderella story\u2019; making Evo\u2019s lineup is a breakthrough to the relative mainstream and the result of years of hard work on the part of its community, and Top 8 showed off the indie fighting game with style. Early in the bracket Shinji \u201cNeji\u201d Taharu pulled off a daring win via timeout, a rare ploy on main stage, though he ultimately lost the match. Later on in Losers Finals, a furious battle between Japanese players Oshuu-hittou and Hishigata saw Hittou coming back from a single pixel of health to take the round, upset Hishigata\u2019s momentum and ultimately take the match 3-1. Still, it was an extremely close match for Oshuu-hittou against Clearlamp in Grand Finals that truly brought the hype, with Hittou very nearly managing to reset the bracket at 2-2 before Clearlamp clutched out a last second victory, which he celebrated with a truly epic pop-off. A great showing for the little indie game that could. Here\u2019s Arslan\u2019s dominating performance against Anakin a few moments back, who\u2019s set to fight his way back out of Loser\u2019s bracket in mere moments. Losers Semifinals: Knee 1 | Take 0: Knee heads in early and traps Take against the wall, who nearly makes it out before getting shut down with a low jab. It goes to trades in round 2 but Knee dominates, sends Take out quickly. Take gets back in Round 3 but it\u2019s match point in semis, still on the ropes. Take\u2019s defence just doesn\u2019t quite hold up, Knee punching him out after a cautious slogging match, dropping Take out at 4th place and Knee advancing into Loser\u2019s finals. Losers Semifinals: Knee v Take: Another Kazumi (Take) vs Steve (Knee) match here in Losers, two highly repped characters here in top 8. Knee hits a rage drive but misses thanks to Take\u2019s crouching stance, Take punishing easily to take round 1. Round 2 looks free for Take but Knee turns it around in moments to swing it, reminding everyone that Tekken (and Knee) can always comeback around in mere moments. It doesn\u2019t happen in round 3, which goes with ease to Take, but Knee has a great read and nails Take on a rage drive straight in the face and follows it up to equalise the first set. Round 4 goes to Knee as well, placing the score at Knee 1: Take 0. Winners Finals: Anakin 0 | Arslan Ash 2: Anakin charges in trying to make up gone ground but Arslan is ready for everything he throws at him, dominating round 1 and again just nearly perfecting Anakin on round 2. Arslan stops playing in round 3 and just runs over Anakin, putting the USA and Anakin down into Loser\u2019s Bracket and putting Pakistan and Arslan Ash into Grand Finals. Winners Finals: Anakin v Arslan Ash: The last US representative left in Tekken on Jack 7 versus Pakistan\u2019s surprise wunderkind Arslan, playing Geese. Who\u2019s going to go to Grand Finals? First blood goes to Arslan in mere moments, but Anakin is up again in round 2, misses a throw, and goes down. Two ruonds quick to Arslan. Anakin starts strong again in Round 3, trapping Arslan on a wall, but can\u2019t convert to a final knockout and gets himself trapped instead, Arslan turns it around and knocks him out. Anakin 0: Arslan 1. Anakin is again trapped early in Round 1 but gets a crucial parry in and sets Arslan against the wall, but Arslan brings it back, taking the round; a repeat performance for Arslan in Round 2 sees just him just completely dominant. Arslan is down to pixel health in round 3, Anakin finally gets a game in, breaking Arslan\u2019s streak, but he takes a lead performance in round 3 and pulls it off, Anakan 0: Arslan 2. We have moved to first to 3 for these sets, so Anakin still has a chance to get back in the game, but the mindset dominance is definitely on Arslan\u2019s side right now. Here\u2019s that commentator\u2019s curse hitting Noroma live on stream. Absolutely hexed. Losers Quarterfinals 2: Take 1 | Noroma 0: Noroma goes in quickly and takes the first round in moments, but a slogging match takes them to 3 seconds on the clock before Noroma finally grabs the round. A dominant performance by Noroma sees him take the rest of the set almost before anything even ocurs, Take 1 | Noroma 1. Back on an infinite stage sees Take recover with a round 1 victory, a dramatic footsie game raising the tension again. Take gets Noroma back into the red in moments, a total reversal of the last set, up 2 rounds to nothing. The crowd is making noise as Take looks dominant with basic cautious play, finally turning it around and sending Noroma out of Top 8; Take advances to face Knee in the Losers Semifinals. Losers Quarterfinals 2: Take v Noroma: Noroma running Steve and Take with Kazumi. As Markman says, it\u2019s a very poke-heavy match, Noroma dominating the first two rounds until Take pushes him back up against a wall. Noroma nearly manages a comeback but gets read on the third hit, poked out. Noroma misses the wallsplat, commentator\u2019s curse kicking in, Take coming back from a near insurmountable death spiral to wallbreak and come back into play, 2-2. Lifebars are tied in round 3, both deep in the purple, a careful game of footsies breaking at the last moment, Take 1: Noroma 0. I was going to recap some of the other tournaments in this short break but they\u2019re just too short, we\u2019re back already. Looks like we\u2019re lining up for Losers Quarterfinals 1: Knee vs Nobi. Might be an issue with one of the headphones, so a slight delay on startup, but looks like it\u2019s nothing serious and a Steve Fox mirror match can proceed. Knee takes a commanding lead in round 1, but gets pressured in round 2, tries to rage art out of it but starts up too early letting Nobi dodge and punish to equalise the set. The announces are yelling about hotdogs during a tense standoff, Knee closing in to clutch out round 3 and then round 4 as well. Knee 1 | Nobi 0. Nobi switches up back to Dragonov in set 2, which gets him within spitting distance of a win but gets clutched out by Knee at the very last second. Second round sees Knee take a more dominant stance, taking the round with relative ease, before Nobi comes back with a solid string of trades - but Knee breaks out with a rage drive to knock Nobi out of Top 8, sending Knee into Loser\u2019s Semifinals. A bit of a blowout there unfortunately for Nobi, but that\u2019s no shame against Knee. Loser\u2019s Round 2: Noroma v Chikurin: Two amazing Japanese players up against one another here, Noroma picking Steve Fox and Chikurin another Geese main. Noroma takes the first round easily, but Chikurin recovers and puts up a fight in round 2 before eating a special to the face and losing the round. He gets back in advantage in round 3 early on, but Noroma plays cautiously, trades, pulls it back and takes the set, Noroma 1 | Chikurin 0. Noroma puts in a dominant performance again for game 2 round 1, Chikurin putting up a bit of a fight but Noroma flattens him again in round 2. Can Chikurin come back? Round 3 sees a strong recovery for Chikurin putting Noroma into rage drive, but nope, it\u2019s all over for Chikurin, Noroma trapping him in the wall and just crushing him. Chikurin out and Noroma moving on to Losers quarterfinals. Loser\u2019s Round 1: LowHigh v Nobi: Two former Evo champions face off in the first round of the loser\u2019s bracket, Lowhigh\u2019s Shaheen v Nobi\u2019s Dragunov. Lowhigh gets the first round by burning a rage art at a crucial moment, but Nobi pressures back in round 2 to take an early lead and takes a perfect. Lowhigh responds with a perfect of his own in round 3, but round 4 comes to a straight up brawl, both players making good trades and keeping the life leads roughly equal until Nobi reads a last second rage art and punishes appropriately to put the set at 2 rounds each. The final round is a strong performance for Nobi, putting him in the lead, Lowhigh 0 | Nobi 1. An infinite stage for Set 2, Lowhigh taking an early lead in the set in round 1 but a beautiful sidestep puts Nobi back within spitting range in round 2. Lowhigh\u2019s capitalises with a juggle to take round 3, round 4 ends up with a dramatic finish stolen by Nobi after Lowhigh messes up a last-minute approach and finds himself facing the wrong way. Round 5 sees Lowhigh come back strongly to equalise the sets, Lowhigh 1 | Nobi 1. This is just a bareknuckle brawl of a match, we\u2019re in Jungle now, both sides at pixel health, Nobi whiffing a punish to let Lowhigh steal the first round but pulling it off in round 2 to equalise. Lowhigh wallbreaks to toss Nobi down a stage, punishes, grabs round 3. Early pokes in round 3 sees Nobi regain momentum, equalising the round, presses Lowhigh up against the wall and takes it with a furious offence, last year\u2019s champ Lowhigh eliminated and Nobi moving up to Loser\u2019s quarterfinals. This is insane Tekken and we\u2019re not even past the initial Loser\u2019s brackets. This is nuts. Winner\u2019s Semis 2: Arslan 0 | Knee 1: Arslan draws first blood on an infinite stage, nearly getting to timeout with 13 seconds left on the clock. A dedicated game of footsies sees the results reverse, Knee taking the second round, but Arslan maintains focus to turn it around again in round 3 and again running it forward in round 4, taking the set to Arslan 1 | Knee 1. Knee switches up the stages to a wall stage since he lost the set, a good choice for Geese, but can he actually capitalise? Big lead for Arslan who takes the first round, and the second. Knee has Kazumi up against a wall early in the third round, then traps her in a corner, reads Arslan\u2019s low kick on wakeup and perfects her - devastating. It looks like the beginning of a Knee comeback until Kazumi wakes up and sends the momentum back in the opposite direction - a tense game of footsies looks like it breaks with a whiff as the timer ticks down - but Arslan gets in at the very last second and breaks out with a second left on the clock, sending Knee into Losers and advancing Arslan to Winners Finals. Winner\u2019s Semis 2: Arslan 0 | Knee 1: Here\u2019s the big storyline for Tekken, the Pakistani prodigy, Arslan Ash up against South Korea\u2019s Knee, a former Evo champion. They\u2019ve met before and Arslan has dominated every time in tournies, but on the main stage of Evo can this be a turnaround? Knee is nearly untouchable to everybody else but Arslan is his bane. Let\u2019s see how this goes. Knee chooses Geese Howard, Arslan playing Kazumi. Both players are playing defensively, small pokes and a quiet back and forth, but a strong sidestep by Knee sees Kazumi punished to equalise the rounds early. Strong defensive play by Arslan saves him when both parties are knocked down to pixel health in the second round, but the fourth is a dominant one for Knee who wins with a last-moment throw. Arslan has dominance in the fifth round, but Geese has charge and comes back around in the last moment to take the set! An amazing comeback. Winner\u2019s Semis 1: Take 0 | Anakin 1: Anakin showing up to play, driving in and stealing Round 1 easily, but Take reverses in Round 2. Anakin leads early in life on round 3 but it goes to trades and Take can\u2019t capitalise, losing out to a flurry of blows. Anakin takes round 3 with a perfect blowout, advancing to the next round in winners! I might slow down on these posts instead of going set by set - Tekken\u2019s just too dang fast. Winner\u2019s Semis 1: Anakin 0 | Take 0: Take has Kazumi, Anakin on Jack-7. Anakin gets in early with a huge life lead and punishes early, taking round 1, then round 2, solid performance very early on. Early trade is advantageous for Anakin but Take gets a wallbreak and juggles effectively to go up a round. Anakin punishes a whiff and takes the first set. Markman and Aris on commentary for Tekken 7 as we start up. Here\u2019s your Top 8 bracket: Winner\u2019s Bracket Anakin [USA] Take [JPN] Arslan [Pakistan] Knee [SKorea] Loser\u2019s Bracket Lowhigh [SKorea] Nobi [JPN] Noroma [JPN] Chikurin [JPN] Obviously I\u2019ve spoken far too soon, with new SamSho DLC and KOF 6 announced during the break. More on that in a moment but we\u2019re moments away from Tekkn 8 Top 8 - let me get my bearings quickly and get right back to the action. It\u2019s an emotional moment for Bonchan, who is a long time Sagat player but last saw grand finals at Evo 2014, where he came out on the losing side vs eventual champion Luffy back in the Street Fighter IV days. Doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s an announcement after this tournie, so I\u2019m going to step out for a moment as they switch over to Tekken and I\u2019ll be back with you very shortly. Grand Finals: Big Bird 2 | Bonchan 2 (W): Bonchan at tournament point can taste the blood in the water, perfecting Big Bird out of the gate in round 2. Rashid responds with the traditional furious offence but drops it halfway through, letting Karin get in, fighting for his life. The tension is palpable as the two sit in the corner, insane defence, teching throws, until Rashid breaks through and equalises the set. It\u2019s tournament point or bracket reset in moments - Bonchan gets the reset but drops it at the last second letting Rashid live on pixel health, who hits Bonchan with a critical art but doesn\u2019t kill - Bonchan takes the read for the follow-up, lands it perfect, and takes it all - Bonchan is your Evo 2019 Street Fighter champion! Grand Finals: Big Bird 2 | Bonchan 1 (W): Bonchan does it again, perfect spacing blunting Big Bird\u2019s rushdown offence in round 1 but backed into the corner in Round 2 and taken out by Big Bird. Can Big Bird reset the bracket here? Bonchan gets Rashid into dizzy, makes a great read, perfects Big Bird to take the set and put him at match point. Grand Finals: Big Bird 2 | Bonchan 0 (W): Bonchan finally turns it around, entering offence early and not letting Big Bird get into his rhythm to take round 1. Round 2 sees the turnabout continue, giving Bonchan his first set, though Big Bird still needs to reset the bracket before a realistic shot at the title. Grand Finals: Big Bird 1 | Bonchan 0: I don\u2019t believe this - Big Bird starts out the second set with another perfect! Bonchan is doing decently but seems like they can\u2019t quite deal with Big Bird\u2019s furious offence, falling to a crazy mixup. Big Bird up 2 sets. From 2000 players it all comes down to this. Our two competitors clink drinks and shake hands and get right into it. Bonchan has switched it back around to Karin, widely regarded as a solid pick, but it makes no difference to Big Bird who perfects Bonchan in round 1. Bonchan gets better treatment in round 2, two solid hits converting into full combos and handing him the round. Round 3 sees a solid defence by Bonchan baited into an uppercut that sees Big Bird immediately capitalise to take the set. Losers finals: Big Bird 2 | Infexious 0: Big Bird takes the early traditional Rashid rushdown, pushing Infexious into a corner and putting himself on match point extremely early. The second round continues much the same, though an uppercut response puts Infexious back within grabbing range of the round, but is trounced by a strong Big Bird mixup, sending Big Bird to Grand Finals and berthing Infexious in third. Losers finals: Big Bird 1 | Infexious 0: Match 2 is a crazy footsie game but Zeku lands a strong punish, Rashid recovers for a brief moment but Infexious grabs him on wakeup to take the first round. Round 2 sees Rashid sitting on pixel life but a series of close trades somehow sees him equalise the set, 1-1. The third round sees an early lead for Infexious but with no fear in his eyes Big Bird catches him jumping, swinging the momentum and giving him the second set. Losers finals: Big Bird 0 | Infexious 0: The bracket clips along at a rapid pace and we\u2019re up to see if the UAE\u2019s Big Bird or the UK\u2019s Infexious will face off against Bonchan, Japan\u2019s number one favourite, in Grand Finals. Big Bird at Rashid and Infexious sticking to Zeku. Round 1 starts swiftly with Rashid trapping Zeku in the corner again, Infexious sitting on pixel life and getting a little recovery in before falling to a quick poke. The second round is a little more even, both players finding more in the way of defence, Infexious surviving some strong Rashid pressure early-game but falling after Big Bird spends V-trigger to take the set. Losers Semifinals: Big Bird 2 | Fujimura 2: Big Bird somehow escapes a terrifying Ibuki rushdown to put him back at match point. A tense staredown of pokes sees neither side getting strong confirms, Ibuki sending out shurikens and kunai and essentially poking Big Bird to death. At match point, both players go totally ham, feeling the victory on the tip of their tongues, Ibuki pulling a strong defence but eventually baited into a wrong move, punished, and bam - eliminated. Big Bird heads into Top 3, Fujimura is going home. Losers Semifinals: Big Bird 2 | Fujimura 1: In a familiar sight Rashid rushes Ibuki down in the corner and gets Big Bird to match point. Fujimura gets back in in round 2 a little to take life lead handily, but a smart spend by Fujimura brings him back 1-1. Round 3 sees no hits landed 15 seconds in, but Fujimura comes back with a good read and equalises the sets, 2-2. Edge of your seat stuff. Losers Semifinals: Big Bird 1 | Fujimura 1: Big Bird again with a furious offence to dominate Fujimura, very nearly managing a second perfect in round 1. A set of back-and-forth combos sees Ibuki taking round 2, but round 3 sends Fujimura right back to the corner, a desperate uppercut not going his way and handing the set handily to Big Bird. Losers Semifinals: Big Bird 1 | Fujimura 0: The momentum continues with Big Bird rushing down Fujimura in moments to take round 1. Round 2 sees Ibuki recovering halfway through to hang in the corner, dizzying Rashid after a furious combination, who nearly breaks through but falls to Ibuki\u2019s shuriken mixups. It\u2019s 1-1 as round 3 starts, both players nearly immediately down to half health, Ibuki with the life lead, baits out Rashid\u2019s EX spinning mixer, boomerang shuriken again putting in work. Set 2 to Fujimura. Losers Semifinals: Big Bird 0 | Fujimura 0: Just three matches left in this Street Fighter Top 8 with Loser\u2019s semis, finals and then Grand Finals blocked out. SKill and James Chen are already both drained. A good handshake before the match begins, Big Bird on Rashid again and Fujimura back on Ibuki. A careful start sees Rashid down half health within 15 seconds, but Ibuki\u2019s taken down there too. A series of great reads sees Big Bird take that first round despite the early life loss. Round 2 starts in similar fashion, but this time Rashid doesn\u2019t escape - Fujimura perfects him in seconds. Round 3 sees the trend reversed, Rashid rushing in and returning the favour with his own perfect to take the first set - absolutely clutch. Evo twitter crew are quick on the Vods, thankfully, so we can add a little colour to this rather texty-looking liveblog. Here\u2019s that last set for Bonchan vs Infexious. Winners Final: Bonchan 2 | Infexious 1: A cautious round by Sagat sees Bonchan up on Round 1, the tension continuing into round 2. Bonchan\u2019s reads are amazing - solid play, nothing flashy, but responds appropriately to Infexious\u2019 approaches and gives him Round 2 and, ultimately, the set. Bonchan advances to Grand Finals. Winners Final: Bonchan 2 | Infexious 0: It\u2019s looking good for Bonchan but it\u2019s not time to relax just yet, playing cautiously especially when Infexious takes back the life lead and ultimately the first round. Suddenly a furious offence by Infexious knocks Bonchan out in moments, a big counter to the previous few rounds of cautious poking and handing Infexious the set. Winners Finals: Bonchan 1 | Infexious 0: Another round disappears before my eyes and Infexious recovers handily to take Round 1 in an instant. A fairly cautious exchange sees Bonchan again responding with a critical art to equalise round points 1-1. Third round begins with cautious footsies again, but Infexious loses out in these exchanges, gets stunned, and loses the set. Winners Finals: Bonchan | Infexious: We\u2019re straight into Winner\u2019s finals. Bonchan returns to his Sagat, up against a Infexious\u2019 Zeku. Both players approach cautiously, but it\u2019s Sagat\u2019s reach and fireball zoning that begins to slowly chip away at Infexious. Finally Infexious jumps in and puts some damage on the map, but Bonchan successfully blocks a second attempt to take round 1. Round 2 begins looking like a repeat of the first round, with Bonchan fireball pressure keeping Infexious at arms reach, but another approach sees Zeku take Sagat down to near-pixel health again. But a crazy reads sees Bonchan take a risk and launch a super to take out Infexious\u2019 advantage and take the first set. Losers Quarterfinals 2: Idom 1 | Fujimura 2: Idom perfects Fujimura immediately, he\u2019s up 2 perfects this match, but takes massive damage in round 2. Idom reads the returning shuriken mixup this time around but is too low health and falls to a throw from Fujimura. Round 3, match point, sees better pressure from Idom but a succession of throws from Ibuki messes him up and takes him out of the game. What a set resulting in Fujimura\u2019s victory, Idom and the dreams of the USA relegated to 5th place. Losers Quarterfinals 2: Idom 1 | Fujimura 1: This match is ridiculously fast, with Fujimura already taking a round in moments. Round 2 is more equal again but Ibuki\u2019s mixup boomerang shuriken puts in some hot work to knock out Laura, handing the set to Fujimura. Losers Quarterfinals 2: Idom 0 | Fujimura 1: Again I blinked and Idom took a round in the flash of an eye. Round 2 sees Laura take Ibuki all the way down to pixel health, but Fujimura very nearly equalises, until a trade of blows knocks Ibuki all the way out. 1-1. Losers Quarterfinals 2: Idom | Fujimura: Idom\u2019s Laura against Fujimura\u2019s Ibuki sees both parties at half health mere seconds into the match. Ibuki drops a killer combo to see Idom begin a recovery but saves it with a jab. Round 2 sees a more cautious entry to start, but Ibuki\u2019s furious pressure sees Fujimura take the first set. Losers Quarterfinals 1: Machabo 0 | Big Bird 2: Machabo takes round 1 with some extensive ground pound work. Rashid comes back in round two to get to match point with some tricky aerial movement from the mobile Rashid. But Machabo knocks Rashid into Stun early and very nearly perfects Big Bird, but what a comeback! Big Bird, reappears out of nowhere, opens Machabo up and - at 10% health - takes him all the way from 100 to 0 with a combination of great reads and mixups. Big Bird advances, knocking Machabo out of Top 8. Losers Quarterfinals 1: Machabo 0 | Big Bird 1: Big Bird immediately traps Necalli in a corner but he comes back with some big damage combos to recover momentum and grab game 1. He continues the flow into Round 2 but misses a crucial uppercut which lets Rashid punish and let Big Bird take the round. Round 3 sees Rashid low on health but catches Machabo napping, letting Big Bird take the set. Losers Quarterfinals 1: Machabo 0 | Big Bird 0: Machabo with Necalli vs Big Bird\u2019s Rashid, with the UAE\u2019s hopes and dreams on his shoulders. Big Bird gets in there round 1 with a fairly good exchange; Machabo puts up a fight but can\u2019t overcome Big Bird\u2019s momentum. Round 1 to Big Bird. Loser\u2019s Round 2: Kichipa-mu 0 | Fujimura 2: It\u2019s looking fairly free for Fujimura at this point who just wades through Zangief\u2019s fierces with ease. Yep - Kichipa-mu is eliminated, clearly feeling the loss, and Fujimura advances. Loser\u2019s Round 2: Kichipa-mu 0 | Fujimura 1: Fujimura is doing good work with projectile setups to catch Zangief\u2019s massive hitboxes, taking Round 1 decisively. Another runaway round puts Fujimura up 2-0. Loser\u2019s Round 2: Kichipa-mu 0 | Fujimura 0: Kichipa-mu gets in immediately and triple piledrives Ibuki to take round 1, but Fujimura shakes it off and puts in a workman performance to equalise with round 2. Kichipa-mu is on pixel health, but Fujimura plays it respectfully and catches him spinning to take the set. Loser\u2019s Round 2: Kichipa-mu | Fujimura We\u2019re back from break, hopefully they\u2019ve fixed the overlays. SKill and James Chen give us a brief look at the bracket again, but we\u2019ve still got one more round in Losers to go - one more elimination - before we even get to the quarterfinals. Kichipa-Mu\u2019s Zangief v Fujimara\u2019s Ibuki. Let\u2019s go. It\u2019s probably worth explaining the bracket system Evo uses while there\u2019s a break in the action. Format-wise, all tournaments for all games are double-elimination: lose a match once, and you\u2019re knocked into the Loser\u2019s bracket, playing against other competitors who have also lost once. Lose there, and you\u2019re out of the competition entirely. This format means that Grand Finals always consists of one fighter who has won every single one of their matches, and one fighter who has only lost one of their matches, which in turn means that the competitor who came out of the Loser\u2019s bracket needs to win twice in order to take the title \u2013 to \u2018reset the bracket\u2019 first and equalise the score. With thousands of entrants in most of the tournaments, whittling down the field to just 8 competitors is a long and involved process that takes literal days, with players fighting their way out of pools (small mini-tournaments) and maintaining winning streaks that will keep them advancing to the next round of competition. Pools are usually seeded by player\u2019s region of origin, with players less likely to face familiar opponents until higher in the bracket, and only if their own skills have let them advance that far. Looks like we\u2019re on break for a hot moment while the Evo streaming crew scramble to fix their overlays, which mysteriously went missing during that last set. Meanwhile, the twitter at least has that last VOD if you missed it: Loser\u2019s Round 1: Big Bird 2 | Yangmian 1 Sorry, I phased out of reality for a brief moment there to come back to find Big Bird up a set. Following that, Big Bird recovers his momentum to take Yangmian back to the corner and crush him in round 1. It comes down to blows in round 2 and swings back Big Bird\u2019s way, knocking Yangmian out of the Top 8 and sending Big Bird onwards. Loser\u2019s Round 1: Big Bird 1 | Yangmian 0 A bit more of a fight in Round 1 with Yangmian putting in some work to take it. Big bird manages to escape a furious Zeku combat and returns him back to the opposite corner, but Yangmian picks him back up and takes Round 2 as well. Loser\u2019s Round 1: Big Bird | Yangmian Get your scissors ready for some cuts - it\u2019s time for the loser\u2019s bracket, with the UAE\u2019s Big Bird playing Rashid up against China\u2019s Yangmian (incorrectly reported on the brackets earlier as Johnny) playing Zeku. Big Bird gets Yangmian in the corner almost immediately and very nearly perfects him in round 1 - and he takes the perfect in round 2 with a domineering performance. A mental gutpunch for Yangmian - is it one he can recover from? Winner\u2019s Bracket Semi-final 2: Machabo 2 | Infexious 2 We\u2019re at match point with Infexious up in Round 1. Machabo sets in the V-trigger and powers up, but a great read by Infexious sends his opponent into Losers with a well-timed throw on wakeup. Victory to Infexious. Winner\u2019s Bracket Semi-final 2: Machabo 2 | Infexious 1 Machabo puts in a domineering performance in Round 1, but a strong defence by Infexious brings it back for Round 2 and 3. Infexious brings it back to equalise at 2:2 with almost no outward response whatsoever. Winner\u2019s Bracket Semi-final 2: Machabo 1 | Infexious 1 Machabo takes round 1 and spends some bar to finish his opponent off in a sudden rush. 2-1 Machabo\u2019s way. Winner\u2019s Bracket Semi-final 2: Machabo 1 | Infexious 0 I blinked and Infexious had Machabo on pixel health, fantastic turnaround. Machabo responds next round with a decent early rush in, but misses a grab and is punished. Last second turnaround doesn\u2019t quite make it as Infexious finishes him off with a jab. It\u2019s 1-1. Winner\u2019s Bracket Semi-final 2: Machabo | Infexious Machabo\u2019s Necalli v Infexious\u2019 Zeku, ready to go, two tricky characters. Good defensive work by Infexious but can\u2019t keep it up, and doesn\u2019t seem to take advantage of his occasional successful pokes - loses the first set to Machabo. Winners Bracket Semi-final 1: Idom 1 | Bonchan 2 Bonchan seems to have found his rhythm, handily taking the third set to sit at match point. Now Idom looks on the defensive as Karin closes in, punishes whiffs - and takes it through, knocking Idom to Loser\u2019s bracket. Victory to Bonchan. Winners Bracket Semi-final 1: Idom 1 | Bonchan 1 Bonchan jumps back to character select and deploys his Karin, who puts up more of a fight but is immediately outpressured by Idom\u2019s intense rushdown to take round 1 - but Bonchan immediately turns it around and equalises, 1-1. Winners Bracket Semi-finals 1: First up is Idom v Bonchan, running Laura v Sagat respectively. In about 10 seconds flat Idom flattens Bonchat - a good start to the night. And Idom follows through and annihilates Bonchat again to take Round 1. We\u2019re ready to go with our regular commentators Seth \u201cSKill\u201d Killian and James \u201cJChen\u201d Chen set to go, but first we\u2019re seeing our competitors. Street Fighter, a former main event and likely moved earlier in the night to attract a larger crowd, gets its own boxing or wrestling style intros for its players. Tournament matches in SFV are first to 3 points. Here\u2019s the official brackets for Top 8 2019: Winner\u2019s Bracket Derek \u201ciDom\u201d Ruffin [USA] Masahiro \u201cBonchan\u201d Takahashi [JPN] Masahiro \u201cMachabo\u201d Tominaga [JPN] DC \u201cInfexious\u201d Coleman [UK] Loser\u2019s Bracket Adel \u201cBig Bird\u201d Anouche [UAE] Yangmian \u201cYangmian\u201d Huang [CHN] Hiroki \u201cKichipa-mu\u201d Asano [JPN] Atsushi \u201cFujimura\u201d Fujimura [JPN] An interesting list, with some notable omissions. Last year\u2019s champ Benjamin \u201cProblem X\u201d Simon didn\u2019t quite make top 8, sitting at rank 13, though he did defeat the much-touted Victor \u201cPunk\u201d Woodley, who currently ranks highest in the world on the Capcom scale. Still, Masato \u201cBonchan\u201d Takahashi and Atsushi \u201cFujimura\u201d Fujimura are familiar faces; could this be their year? On Evo: The Evolution Championship Series, more commonly known as Evo, is one of the mainstays of the fighting game community, having existed in various forms since 1996. An Evo championship winner is widely considered to be the best in the world in their respective game. One reason is the completely open format of the various tournaments: if you can physically turn up to Las Vegas and pay the entry fee, you have a shot of making it all the way to the top. Contestants travel from all over the world to play at Evo, with winners in recent years from Japan, Sweden, South Korea and the UK, though the bulk of players are based out of North America. Fighting games in general have a somewhat rugged reputation in terms of production values and especially prize pool, which even at Evo \u2013 the biggest FCG event of them all \u2013 sits in the tens of thousands of dollars (compared to the almost-regular million dollar tournaments for games like League of Legends and Fortnite). Nonetheless, Evo has a certain wild grassroots and community appeal that\u2019s difficult to replicate elsewhere. Just rolled out of bed to see Capcom\u2019s Yoshinori Ono and wrestling\u2019s Xavier Woods leading the crowd in the traditional Sho-ryu-ken before Street Fighter Top 8. Apparently we\u2019re 20 minutes behind schedule even though BBTag wrapped early. Not entirely unexpected. Ladies and gentlemen, scrubs and stream monsters, welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of day 3 of Evolution 2019, the world\u2019s premiere fighting game tournament. We\u2019re late to the party, with a plethora of great games already wrapped over Friday and Saturday and even earlier today, but we\u2019re here now and ready to deliver Top 8 for Street Fighter 5, Tekken 7, and this year\u2019s main event, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. And since that\u2019s going to take quite some time, we\u2019re also going to serve up some of the highlights over the last few days of furious competition - the biggest blowups, the saltiest runbacks, the weird, the wacky and the just plain hypest matches out there. With almost all of the official tournaments already over except these last three, there\u2019s only one place left standing to watch events unfold: the main channel on Twitch. Fair warning: this is somewhat of an experimental liveblog, so if you want to get in touch, drop me a line or tweet me. I\u2019ve just woken up (timezones, y\u2019know) so I\u2019ve got to quickly scrub through the Blazblue results, assuming it finished on time, but I\u2019ll be up and ready to go in moments.",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Monday morning.</p> \n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam has warned that pro-democracy protesters are pushing the city to the verge of a \u201cvery dangerous situation\u201d as the usually bustling financial hub was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/hong-kong-brought-to-a-standstill-as-city-wide-strikes-and-protests-hit\">brought to a standstill</a> this morning by activists and strike action. Making her first public appearance for two weeks, Lam said the activists were \u201cbullying\u201d those with different opinions and \u201cbreaking the rice bowls\u201d of ordinary Hong Kongers. She also accused the protesters of using their opposition to the controversial extradition bill \u2013 the spark for weeks of protests \u2013 as a cover for \u201crevolution\u201d. Her remarks, flanked by her whole cabinet, came as the city\u2019s rush hour turned to chaos this morning as activists blocked roads and disrupted the city\u2019s subway system. In the Yuen Long district, a car rammed its way through barricades, barely missing protesters who were trying to push it back. More than 100 flights from the city\u2019s airport were cancelled because of strike action by public sector workers that also affected schools and government offices. Businesses throughout the city were shuttered for the day in anticipation of a series of marches on Monday afternoon.

Investigators have charged 21-year-old Patrick Crusius with murder and believe that he was motivated by a hatred of Hispanic immigrants.

The shadow chancellor has written to Boris Johnson calling for an investigation into Javid\u2019s banking career which saw him hold various senior positions at the German investment bank in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Fresh protests threaten to deepen Hong Kong crisis Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Monday morning. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam has warned that pro-democracy protesters are pushing the city to the verge of a \u201cvery dangerous situation\u201d as the usually bustling financial hub was brought to a standstill this morning by activists and strike action. Making her first public appearance for two weeks, Lam said the activists were \u201cbullying\u201d those with different opinions and \u201cbreaking the rice bowls\u201d of ordinary Hong Kongers. She also accused the protesters of using their opposition to the controversial extradition bill \u2013 the spark for weeks of protests \u2013 as a cover for \u201crevolution\u201d. Her remarks, flanked by her whole cabinet, came as the city\u2019s rush hour turned to chaos this morning as activists blocked roads and disrupted the city\u2019s subway system. In the Yuen Long district, a car rammed its way through barricades, barely missing protesters who were trying to push it back. More than 100 flights from the city\u2019s airport were cancelled because of strike action by public sector workers that also affected schools and government offices. Businesses throughout the city were shuttered for the day in anticipation of a series of marches on Monday afternoon. Keep up with developments as they happen on our live blog. * * * Pension \u2018ripoff\u2019 \u2013 Some pension funds are making a \u201cfat living\u201d from savers and should come under tougher scrutiny, according to a hard-hitting report by MPs. They are \u201cunconvinced\u201d the industry will act voluntarily on providing transparent information and call on the government to use the \u201cfull force of the law\u201d against funds guilty of \u201cmisinforming, mischarging, overcharging\u201d on the savings of pensioners. Such charges are \u201ceroding the value of individuals\u2019 savings\u201d, they said, giving the example of one fund that initially said it had charged members \u00a310m in fees before being forced to reveal the real figure of \u00a392m. Frank Field, chairman of the Commons work and pensions committee, said: \u201cRipping off pension savers could be eliminated.\u201d * * * America wounded \u2013 Donald Trump has been widely criticised for stoking hatred across America in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting that left 20 people dead. Investigators have charged 21-year-old Patrick Crusius with murder and believe that he was motivated by a hatred of Hispanic immigrants. A message posted on the website 8chan 20 minutes before the attack on Saturday expressed sympathy with the Christchurch mosque attacker and said: \u201cThis attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d Trump has stepped up his divisive rhetoric in recent weeks but as the nation digested news of a second mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio that left nine people dead on Sunday, he suggested the violence was caused by mental health problems. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is from El Paso, led the attacks on Trump and was joined by other leading Democrats. Sam Levin, our reporter in El Paso, write about how the city\u2019s large Hispanic population is dealing with the tragedy. * * * \u2018Profited from greed\u2019 \u2013 John McDonnell has questioned Sajid Javid\u2019s suitability as chancellor because of his role in selling risky financial products in his former job with Deutsche Bank. The shadow chancellor has written to Boris Johnson calling for an investigation into Javid\u2019s banking career which saw him hold various senior positions at the German investment bank in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis. In the letter he says it would not be lost on people suffering from government austerity measures that Javid \u201cprofited from the greed\u201d that contributed to the crisis. * * * Out of credit \u2013 Minister are being urged to review \u201cunfair practices\u201d in the benefits system after reports of a surge in cases where EU citizens living in the the UK are being incorrectly denied universal credit. Many are being left destitute as a result because cases can take months to resolve. Welfare advisers say complexities introduced to the system to tackle public concern about \u201cbenefit tourism\u201d is wrongly penalising people. In his column today, John Harris looks at how the intertwined sagas of austerity and Brexit show that \u201ca whole swathe of public opinion has long since turned cruel and inward-looking\u201d. * * * Tate arrest \u2013 A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a six-year-old boy was allegedly thrown from the 10th-floor viewing platform at the Tate Modern in London yesterday afternoon. The boy was taken to hospital by air ambulance after landing on a fifth-floor roof and was in a critical condition overnight, police said. The 17-year-old male suspect remained with members of the public on the 10th floor of the art gallery before he was arrested. Today in Focus podcast Edita Ochieng and like-minded women tell the extraordinary story of how they are taking a stand against endemic sexual violence and police corruption in the infamous Nairobi slum area of Kibera. Plus: Angelique Chrisafis on why climate protesters in France are stealing portraits of Emmanuel Macron. Lunchtime read: Noel Gallagher: \u2018I don\u2019t forgive people\u2019 Noel Gallagher has always had opinions to burn and today\u2019s G2 interview with the former Oasis kingpin is no exception. From why Jeremy Corbyn is a communist to what it\u2019s like having a teenage daughter, and from why there mustn\u2019t be a second Brexit vote to how climate change might be a good thing, he doesn\u2019t hold back. But, of course, he is especially vituperative about his brother Liam, whom he accuses of sending threatening texts to his family. \u201cI don\u2019t forgive people,\u201d he says. Tim Jonze charts his way through the expletives and even finds out a bit about Gallgher\u2019s new record. Sport Steve Smith claimed playing against England was like Christmas every day after his second century of the first Test left Joe Root\u2019s side needing to bat through today\u2019s fifth day to prevent Australia from claiming a 1-0 Ashes lead. After the disappointment and disarray of Hockenheim, Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes enjoyed a remarkable, redemptive comeback at the Hungarian Grand Prix. Japan\u2019s Hinako Shibuno captured hearts and minds long before she decided to take delivery of the Women\u2019s British Open trophy for good measure. Yesterday\u2019s Community Shield, won by Manchester City on penalties, was a relatively even game that Liverpool might have won in second half and that is good news for the Premier League. Manchester United are growing frustrated in their pursuit of Paulo Dybala, having failed to agree a deal with the Juventus forward regarding his salary, his image rights and any commission to his agent. And Tom Brady has insisted for some time that he can play into his mid-40s and it appears the New England Patriots agree. Business HSBC chief executive John Flint has resigned after just 18 months in the top job. Flint, a 30-year veteran of the bank, has stepped down by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d because the bank judged it needed change to meet the \u201cincreasingly complex and challenging\u201d business environment. In the US, there will be great interest in profit figures from Disney this week as it prepares to launch a streaming platform to rival Netflix. Asian markets have been rocked by the Hong Kong crisis and China\u2019s decision to let the yuan slip below the seven-to-one dollar mark. Experts said it suggests Beijing has given up hope of reaching a trade deal with the US and is \u201cweaponising\u201d its currency. The FTSE 100 is poised to follow Friday\u2019s heavy losses with a drop of 1.2% this morning. The pound is stuck at two-year lows of $1.215 and \u20ac1.092. The papers The two mass shootings in the US make the front pages of the Guardian and the i: \u201cTrump accused of fuelling hate after deadly shootings\u201d and \u201cAmerican nightmare\u201d. The Telegraph is concerned that \u201cPension pot rip-off fees \u2018could wipe out savings\u2019\u201d, as is the Express: \u201cThe great pensions robbery\u201d. The Mail splashes with the story of the young boy thrown from a viewing platform at the Tate Modern: \u201cHorror at the Tate\u201d. The Times reports that the PM is planning an election if remain MPs try to topple him: \u201cJohnson lays ground for \u2018people v politicians\u2019 poll\u201d. The Sun leads with an exclusive story that McDonald\u2019s paper straws are non-recyclable. \u201cThat sucks,\u201d its headline puns.

Phone and internet services are reportedly down in Kashmir valley, where public gatherings have been banned and schools closed. Last week thousands of tourists and pilgrims were ordered to leave the area, after the Indian government warned of a terror threat posed to pilgrim routes. A major security build up, including the deployment of 10,000 extra troops, has prompted fears that Delhi is preparing to scrap Kashmir\u2019s special status, which prevents people from outside of the state from buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris fear that abolishing the state\u2019s special status would fundamentally change the demography of the Muslim-majority territory. The ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has repeatedly pledged to scrap such rules, though analysts warn that doing so would create instability and heighten tension with Pakistan. In the early hours of Monday, several political leaders said they had been placed under house arrest, including Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti and Sajjad Lone, chairman of People\u2019s Conference.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s Thursday and the residents of Jakarta\u2019s Cosmo Park are out jogging, watering their plants or walking their dogs along neat asphalt roads. Neighbourhood kids pedal their bikes under frangipani trees and peach-coloured bougainvillea to the pool and tennis court. Apartments, comfortable and modern, sit side by side, with barbecues and toys stacked outside. Quiet and orderly, it feels like any other suburban idyll \u2013 but there is one difference. Cosmo Park is a village in the sky, perched 10 storeys up on top of a shopping centre and car park, a world away from the heaving megalopolis below. It is a surreal urban bubble, where normal life unfolds at an abnormal altitude. To access ground level, resident drive their cars down a ramp. A tall metal fence runs around the perimeter to make sure no one falls or drives off. Peer beyond the fence and you can spot the city\u2019s landmarks below. Cosmo Park was built 10 years ago but was largely unknown outside Jakarta until last month, when a drone photograph broadcast its oddness to the world. In June, Twitter user @shahrirbahar1 posted a bird\u2019s eye view of the complex, 78 two-storey, cookie-cutter units on top of the parking lot with Jakarta\u2019s immense urban sprawl in the background. It was a photo that captured both the scale and incongruity of the project. \u201cGood morning Jakarta,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat type of person thinks about developing a housing complex on top of a building?\u201d Retweeted almost 27,000 times, the post spawned a long thread of incredulity and wisecracks (how do food delivery drivers find it?) but also serious questions about the wisdom of the city\u2019s urban development, such as how might a complex like this fare in an earthquake? Home to 10 million people and almost three times that including the greater Jakarta area, the Indonesian capital is buckling under the weight of its problems, from chronic floods and unbelieveably bad traffic to severe pollution, overcrowding and the fact that it is literally sinking. So severe are the city\u2019s problems the president has once again raised the idea of moving the capital. Is Cosmo Park some kind of postmodern dystopia or, in a city beset by perennial woe, an ingenious use of urban space? While some outsiders are unconvinced, those who live at Cosmo Park offer glowing reviews. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely oasis,\u201d says Fazila Kapasi, as she tails her four-year-old son around on his bike along one of the complex\u2019s neat roads. \u201cI cannot recommend it enough.\u201d Fazila and her husband moved to Jakarta from Mumbai, and chose Cosmo Park partly because they were concerned about Jakarta\u2019s floods. But after living there for six years Fazila can reel off a string of other advantages, including that it is less isolating than standard apartment living. In the afternoon Fazila stops to chat to her neighbours, while most days she and her son feed the pigeons that live in a nearby tree. She also has her own garden, where she has a hammock and space to grow aubergines, tomatoes and chillies. \u201cIt is so good. There is so much open space, my son can ride his bike around. It\u2019s so central, it\u2019s really safe, and there is a lovely neighbourhood feel,\u201d she says. At Cosmo Park there is an uncanny sensation of being simultaneously up and down, but residents are used to it. \u201cI feel like this is a real house, not an apartment,\u201d exclaims Indri Lestari, who moved into Cosmo Park with her husband, who is Spanish, and their young son three months ago. \u201cIt\u2019s just there is no kaki lima [street food cart] here,\u201d she jokes. Indri says she laughed when she saw the complex on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s high here, for sure,\u201d says Indri, who moved from a higher apartment block nearby. \u201cBut lots of places are and here we have more space and privacy, and it\u2019s better for my family. My son can play outside, just out the door.\u201d Situated amid a cluster of mega malls in Jakarta\u2019s centre, Cosmo Park is one of two such developments in Jakarta by the Indonesian property developer the Agung Podomoro Group, and was built according to regulations. The second is above the Mall of Indonesia in the city\u2019s north. \u201cBut this one is more popular,\u201d notes the real estate agent showing the Guardian around Cosmo Park, past the pool and launderette and minimarket, as she extols its convenient location. \u201cA lot of foreigners choose this place,\u201d she says, before leaving with a parting note: \u201cYou know who to call if you want to live here.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "body": "<p>The faded, creased photograph shows a 13-year-old Vallie Brown smiling shyly as she pulls back her hair in the back of a large van. She is wearing a white one-piece swimsuit and at first glance, she looks like she\u2019s coming back from a sun-soaked day at the beach.</p> <p>Looking at the picture of Brown, few people would suspect that the girl in the snapshot was living out of that van with her mother. That each night after it grew dark, she curled up on the backseats to sleep. That she wore that swimsuit under her clothes because she had to bathe in gas station bathrooms.</p> <p>More than four decades later, and long before government data would ultimately confirm her suspicion, her experiences helped Brown to recognize that California\u2019s housing crisis had taken another complicated turn \u2013 that the tenuous existence of her family in her youth had become a reality for far too many in the present.</p> <p>\u201cI recognized the signs,\u201d Brown, now a San Francisco lawmaker, said. \u201cWhen you see a van or a car with curtains up, or a towel rolled up in the window for privacy. People with their doors open, and you see a bunch of stuff in their car, or they\u2019re airing out clothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t consider themselves homeless,\u201d she continued, adding that the line between living in a vehicle and being homeless is sometimes blurry. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b8b442b117ace3440392d82581e1dca68ad76f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b8b442b117ace3440392d82581e1dca68ad76f5/353_478_5407_3243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vallie Brown, 13, in the van she lived in with her mother.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vallie Brown, 13, in the van she lived in with her mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Vallie Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All around the Bay Area, they hide in plain sight, the vehicles doubling as shelters. Some, as Brown described, are easily recognizable \u2013 an overstuffed RV with so many items strapped to the sides that the wheels appear sunken down, a van with a taped-up window, a camper so antiquated that it doesn\u2019t seem operational. Others can pass as your neighbor\u2019s car: a 2006 Lexus sedan in great condition, a late-model vehicle kept neat for Uber and Lyft rides.</p> <p>San Francisco counted 1,794 people living out of their vehicles in 2019, a 45% increase from the last homeless count in 2017. <a href=\"http://everyonehome.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019_HIRDReport_Alameda_FinalDraft_7.23.19.pdf\">Across the bay in Alameda county</a>, home of Oakland, officials counted 2,817 individuals living out of vehicles \u2013 more than double the 1,259 they counted in 2017.</p> <p>The uptick in vehicle living comes as no surprise to housing advocates, who have long warned of the consequences of an untenable housing crisis in the region. For the last 10 years, California has constructed less than half <a href=\"http://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-research/plans-reports/docs/California's-Housing-Future-Full-Public-Draft.pdf\">the new homes needed to keep up with population growth</a>, creating a scarcity that has driven up rents and home prices.</p> <p>In San Francisco, the median price of homes was <a href=\"https://www.bayareamarketreports.com/trend/san-francisco-home-prices-market-trends-news\">$1.7m in 2019</a> and the median rent was <a href=\"https://www.zumper.com/blog/2019/06/zumper-national-rent-report-june-2019/\">$3,700 for a one-bedroom apartment</a>. Amid the crisis, homelessness in general has surged.

Los Angeles county had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/04/los-angeles-homeless-population-city-county\">12% increase in the homeless population</a> over the last year, with the numbers surging to nearly 59,000 across the county. <a href=\"https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=3468-2019-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-vehicles-tents-and-makeshift-shelters-by-geographic-area.pdf\">Officials tallied</a> 9,981 cars, vans, RVs and campers acting as shelters for a staggering 16,525 people in 2019 \u2013 28% of the county\u2019s entire unhoused population.</p> <p>Officials have had to balance helping this population in a compassionate manner, while also addressing constituent complaints about them. Some cities like San Francisco and Berkeley have enforced oversized vehicle bans on certain streets, leading to the ticketing and towing of what is essentially people\u2019s homes. Some, like San Francisco and Oakland have proposed safe parking zones, where individuals with vehicles that fit certain parameters can securely leave their belongings without fear of enforcement for an allotted period of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3689d5c4dec5985c3129193bbd4226c5a73dd26e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3689d5c4dec5985c3129193bbd4226c5a73dd26e/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abandoned cars dot the Community of Grace encampment near a Home Depot in Oakland, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abandoned cars dot the Community of Grace encampment near a Home Depot in Oakland, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Henry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The tent life, forget it\u2019</h2> <p>Vehicle living is not a new phenomenon, especially in the west where the weather is milder than in other parts of the country. Brown and her older sister lived out of their van periodically throughout the 1970s, while their mother worked to save up money for the next apartment. \u201cShe had odd jobs, and we moved a lot, and it was usually because we couldn\u2019t afford the rent,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019d usually pick up and move before we got evicted.\u201d</p> <p>But homeless advocates say the numbers are on the rise. The transient population is notoriously difficult to count, and those living in their vehicles are even more so because of their mobility. From their work with the population, however, advocates know that many have recently become homeless, and then got stuck in this life. Some are on their own. Some are with their families. Some have children. Some have steady work, and money saved up \u2013 just not enough to finance the high cost of rent in California.</p> <p>\u201cThere are more and more people who have assets and means that are becoming homeless, which is very scary,\u201d said Jeff Kositsky, the director of San Francisco\u2019s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, noting that many RVs, for example, are worth some money. \u201c[Their owners] are clearly people with some sort of assets, as opposed to some guy curled up in a blanket sleeping in a doorway.\u201d</p> <p>Roberto Lopez, 44, falls into that category. He makes $25 an hour working construction, and manages a steady 40 hours a week. But he\u2019s been homeless since he lost his apartment two years ago. \u201cI thought, I can get another apartment, no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there was nothing less than $2,000.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"794493bbadb52a46e2924598fd962426514af3b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/794493bbadb52a46e2924598fd962426514af3b4/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Lopez inside the kitchen at the Community of Grace encampment near a Home Depot in Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Lopez inside the kitchen at the Community of Grace encampment near a Home Depot in Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Henry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first, Lopez tried staying with family members. \u201cThey have kids, they have their own families. They love me, they treat me good, but then three, four months later, frictions everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Now, Lopez\u2019s faded black minivan is part of the Community of Grace, an encampment on a paved lot in East Oakland, near the Interstate 880 overpass and a Home Depot. Flies buzz thick along the roadway leading up to it, circling piles of shoes, plywood and debris spilling out into street.</p> <p>Friendly and chatty, Lopez is quick to greet strangers entering the camp. His deep smile lines crinkled easily at the corners of his eyes as he teased the other camp residents passing by.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a thing going on here,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d</p> <p>The camp consists of dozens of vans, cars, RVs and trailers, crammed into a circle alongside tiny houses and plywood structures. There\u2019s a community kitchen and a designated garbage spot. Clothes hang along the fence enclosing the lot, part of a makeshift store where one resident sells items for $1 each.</p> <p>Lopez\u2019s family thought he had to have been addicted to drugs and alcohol to be living at the camp. \u201cBut I only started doing it because I saw the need to do this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lopez doesn\u2019t want to live in his van forever, though. \u201cThis is not my life,\u201d he insisted. But right now, he wants to stay with his friends. He wants to make sure they\u2019re taken care of, like they take care of him. \u201cIt\u2019s a community thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a family thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d5d75c1597f8951b30320705c7958d066735c90b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5d75c1597f8951b30320705c7958d066735c90b/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A makeshift dollar store at the Community of Grace encampment near a Home Depot in Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A makeshift dollar store at the Community of Grace encampment near a Home Depot in Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Henry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For as long as people need shelter and have a vehicle, sleeping in a car is preferable to the alternatives.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes sense, that if someone loses their housing and they happen to own a vehicle or can get a vehicle, they will sleep in there rather than hard on the street,\u201d said Kelley Cutler, the human rights organizer for the Coalition on Homelessness, a San Francisco-based not-for-profit organization. \u201cIf you\u2019re sleeping on the street, you\u2019re really at risk. You\u2019re at risk in your vehicle, too, but at least you have some protection.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe tent life, forget it,\u201d said Chris Eakin, standing along Evans Avenue in San Francisco.</p> <p>Eakin was soaking some dishes with soapy water on the pavement next to his faded orange-and-yellow RV. \u201cMy sink broke down in there, so I got to do it out here,\u201d he explained.

He had been living in a tent on the streets after losing his work in flooring following a back injury. One day, he left his camping gear with a friend, only to return to find all his possessions stolen. The next day, Blondie was wrongfully accused of biting someone, and animal care and control took her away.</p> <p>\u201cI just fell to my knees,\u201d Eakin said. \u201cI looked up, and I said, \u2018Well, if you can hear me, what do I do? I\u2019ve hit my end.\u2019 And I got an answer, loud and clear: call your mom.\u201d</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t spoken to his family for years, but they reunited at animal care and control, helped him get Blondie back, and then helped him get his first RV.</p> <p>That was six years ago. Since then, life has become exponentially better. \u201cHaving an RV, I can lock the door and the dogs are safe, too.\u201d</p> <p>Eakin feels comfortable enough now to leave from time to time to work odd jobs. He has a community of other RV dwellers. And he has a band, Grape Soda, with two of them. Their cramped studio is set up in one of their RVs, complete with a drum kit, guitars and a sound mixer.</p> <p>But he\u2019s tired.</p> <p>\u201cIt just gets old,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shower is broken at the moment. The gray water tank leaks, and so does the supply line. It would just be nice to be stable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9eed1904e7ad378f6437a44b6116e8373be94eec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eed1904e7ad378f6437a44b6116e8373be94eec/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dave, of the band Grape Soda, outside his RV parked along Toland Avenue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dave, of the band Grape Soda, outside his RV parked along Toland Avenue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Henry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s one step from living hard on the streets\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Aid workers say the needs of RV dwellers are divergent. Many vehicle dwellers don\u2019t consider themselves homeless, and therefore don\u2019t know of the resources available.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people who are extremely sick and living in extremely bad conditions,\u201d said Kositsky, the head of San Francisco\u2019s department of homelessness and supportive housing. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about hoarding and cluttering, black water leaking into the streets, mold inside these vehicles that don\u2019t move. They\u2019re using it as a metal tent. They\u2019re not as visible and they can be in their vehicles, really sick, and no one will really know.\u201d</p> <p>But in a recent survey, the department also found that 25% of people living out of their vehicles had homes elsewhere. They were what local economists call \u201csuper commuters\u201d \u2013 individuals who drive up to hundreds of miles into the city for the work week, returning on the weekends to their home areas where housing is more affordable. Some are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/07/the-uber-drivers-forced-to-sleep-in-parking-lots-to-make-a-decent-living\">Uber and Lyft drivers</a>. Most are contractors, in some form.</p> <p>\u201cOur overall summary of this is that we think that at least half of the people need help, but at least half of the people do not need the kind of help that our department is able to offer,\u201d Kositsky said.</p> <p>Short of a quick fix for the housing crisis that fuels the rise in homelessness, lawmakers have struggled to come up with policies to address the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fa1f9bb34ea746b87a55d7b771058a34865ce97d0%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2000&amp;left-caption=Dave%20playing%20drums%20inside%20his%20RV.&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F2c78b235fb741c3c10947a175947783938513ece%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2000&amp;right-caption=A%20drum%20on%20the%20dashboard%20of%20Dave\u2019s%20RV.%20Photographs%20by%20Jason%20Henry%2FThe%20Guardian&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Photos\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fa1f9bb34ea746b87a55d7b771058a34865ce97d0%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2000&left-caption=Dave%20playing%20drums%20inside%20his%20RV.&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F2c78b235fb741c3c10947a175947783938513ece%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2000&right-caption=A%20drum%20on%20the%20dashboard%20of%20Dave\u2019s%20RV.%20Photographs%20by%20Jason%20Henry%2FThe%20Guardian&always-place-captions-below=false\">Photos</a> </figure>  <p>On one hand, a car provides more security and safety for the individual, and attracts fewer complaints than tent encampments or the more visibly homeless. But still, constituents complain about vehicle dwellers. They take up valuable parking spaces. They leak gasoline and sewage. And in general, trash pickup doesn\u2019t exist for people living in cars. Not every individual has a working bathroom.</p> <p>Cities around the region have considered some form of prohibiting oversized vehicles from overnight parking, efforts that homeless advocates have opposed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cycle where they\u2019re shuffling people around and not creating places to go,\u201d said Cutler of the Coalition on Homelessness.</p> <p>The criminalization of vehicles also result in people\u2019s homes getting ticketed or worse, towed with all their belongings \u2013 and more often than not, the individuals don\u2019t have the funds to retrieve their cars out of impound.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people are living in their vehicles, it\u2019s one step from having to sleep hard on the street, and it\u2019s one step from stable housing,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely detrimental when they lose their vehicle.\u201d</p> <p>Vallie Brown came into office as a San Francisco supervisor in 2018 and found the other supervisors asking for bans on certain streets in their districts.

      "bodyText": "The faded, creased photograph shows a 13-year-old Vallie Brown smiling shyly as she pulls back her hair in the back of a large van. She is wearing a white one-piece swimsuit and at first glance, she looks like she\u2019s coming back from a sun-soaked day at the beach. Looking at the picture of Brown, few people would suspect that the girl in the snapshot was living out of that van with her mother. That each night after it grew dark, she curled up on the backseats to sleep. That she wore that swimsuit under her clothes because she had to bathe in gas station bathrooms. More than four decades later, and long before government data would ultimately confirm her suspicion, her experiences helped Brown to recognize that California\u2019s housing crisis had taken another complicated turn \u2013 that the tenuous existence of her family in her youth had become a reality for far too many in the present. \u201cI recognized the signs,\u201d Brown, now a San Francisco lawmaker, said. \u201cWhen you see a van or a car with curtains up, or a towel rolled up in the window for privacy. People with their doors open, and you see a bunch of stuff in their car, or they\u2019re airing out clothing.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t consider themselves homeless,\u201d she continued, adding that the line between living in a vehicle and being homeless is sometimes blurry. All around the Bay Area, they hide in plain sight, the vehicles doubling as shelters. Some, as Brown described, are easily recognizable \u2013 an overstuffed RV with so many items strapped to the sides that the wheels appear sunken down, a van with a taped-up window, a camper so antiquated that it doesn\u2019t seem operational. Others can pass as your neighbor\u2019s car: a 2006 Lexus sedan in great condition, a late-model vehicle kept neat for Uber and Lyft rides. San Francisco counted 1,794 people living out of their vehicles in 2019, a 45% increase from the last homeless count in 2017. Across the bay in Alameda county, home of Oakland, officials counted 2,817 individuals living out of vehicles \u2013 more than double the 1,259 they counted in 2017. The uptick in vehicle living comes as no surprise to housing advocates, who have long warned of the consequences of an untenable housing crisis in the region. For the last 10 years, California has constructed less than half the new homes needed to keep up with population growth, creating a scarcity that has driven up rents and home prices. In San Francisco, the median price of homes was $1.7m in 2019 and the median rent was $3,700 for a one-bedroom apartment. Amid the crisis, homelessness in general has surged. San Francisco saw a 17% rise in numbers, while Alameda county had a 43% uptick. Oakland alone constituted more than half of the county\u2019s entire homeless count. Other parts of California have seen similar increases. Los Angeles county had a 12% increase in the homeless population over the last year, with the numbers surging to nearly 59,000 across the county. Officials tallied 9,981 cars, vans, RVs and campers acting as shelters for a staggering 16,525 people in 2019 \u2013 28% of the county\u2019s entire unhoused population. Officials have had to balance helping this population in a compassionate manner, while also addressing constituent complaints about them. Some cities like San Francisco and Berkeley have enforced oversized vehicle bans on certain streets, leading to the ticketing and towing of what is essentially people\u2019s homes. Some, like San Francisco and Oakland have proposed safe parking zones, where individuals with vehicles that fit certain parameters can securely leave their belongings without fear of enforcement for an allotted period of time. \u2018The tent life, forget it\u2019 Vehicle living is not a new phenomenon, especially in the west where the weather is milder than in other parts of the country. Brown and her older sister lived out of their van periodically throughout the 1970s, while their mother worked to save up money for the next apartment. \u201cShe had odd jobs, and we moved a lot, and it was usually because we couldn\u2019t afford the rent,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019d usually pick up and move before we got evicted.\u201d But homeless advocates say the numbers are on the rise. The transient population is notoriously difficult to count, and those living in their vehicles are even more so because of their mobility. From their work with the population, however, advocates know that many have recently become homeless, and then got stuck in this life. Some are on their own. Some are with their families. Some have children. Some have steady work, and money saved up \u2013 just not enough to finance the high cost of rent in California. \u201cThere are more and more people who have assets and means that are becoming homeless, which is very scary,\u201d said Jeff Kositsky, the director of San Francisco\u2019s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, noting that many RVs, for example, are worth some money. \u201c[Their owners] are clearly people with some sort of assets, as opposed to some guy curled up in a blanket sleeping in a doorway.\u201d Roberto Lopez, 44, falls into that category. He makes $25 an hour working construction, and manages a steady 40 hours a week. But he\u2019s been homeless since he lost his apartment two years ago. \u201cI thought, I can get another apartment, no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there was nothing less than $2,000.\u201d At first, Lopez tried staying with family members. \u201cThey have kids, they have their own families. They love me, they treat me good, but then three, four months later, frictions everywhere.\u201d Now, Lopez\u2019s faded black minivan is part of the Community of Grace, an encampment on a paved lot in East Oakland, near the Interstate 880 overpass and a Home Depot. Flies buzz thick along the roadway leading up to it, circling piles of shoes, plywood and debris spilling out into street. Friendly and chatty, Lopez is quick to greet strangers entering the camp. His deep smile lines crinkled easily at the corners of his eyes as he teased the other camp residents passing by. \u201cWe have a thing going on here,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d The camp consists of dozens of vans, cars, RVs and trailers, crammed into a circle alongside tiny houses and plywood structures. There\u2019s a community kitchen and a designated garbage spot. Clothes hang along the fence enclosing the lot, part of a makeshift store where one resident sells items for $1 each. Lopez\u2019s family thought he had to have been addicted to drugs and alcohol to be living at the camp. \u201cBut I only started doing it because I saw the need to do this,\u201d he said. Lopez doesn\u2019t want to live in his van forever, though. \u201cThis is not my life,\u201d he insisted. But right now, he wants to stay with his friends. He wants to make sure they\u2019re taken care of, like they take care of him. \u201cIt\u2019s a community thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a family thing.\u201d For as long as people need shelter and have a vehicle, sleeping in a car is preferable to the alternatives. \u201cIt makes sense, that if someone loses their housing and they happen to own a vehicle or can get a vehicle, they will sleep in there rather than hard on the street,\u201d said Kelley Cutler, the human rights organizer for the Coalition on Homelessness, a San Francisco-based not-for-profit organization. \u201cIf you\u2019re sleeping on the street, you\u2019re really at risk. You\u2019re at risk in your vehicle, too, but at least you have some protection.\u201d \u201cThe tent life, forget it,\u201d said Chris Eakin, standing along Evans Avenue in San Francisco. Eakin was soaking some dishes with soapy water on the pavement next to his faded orange-and-yellow RV. \u201cMy sink broke down in there, so I got to do it out here,\u201d he explained. Inside his vehicle, his \u201cbabies\u201d, a yellow labrador named Blondie and a brown-and-white mutt named Mimi, barked at the approach of a stranger. Eakin moved into his first RV at one of the lowest points of his life. He had been living in a tent on the streets after losing his work in flooring following a back injury. One day, he left his camping gear with a friend, only to return to find all his possessions stolen. The next day, Blondie was wrongfully accused of biting someone, and animal care and control took her away. \u201cI just fell to my knees,\u201d Eakin said. \u201cI looked up, and I said, \u2018Well, if you can hear me, what do I do? I\u2019ve hit my end.\u2019 And I got an answer, loud and clear: call your mom.\u201d He hadn\u2019t spoken to his family for years, but they reunited at animal care and control, helped him get Blondie back, and then helped him get his first RV. That was six years ago. Since then, life has become exponentially better. \u201cHaving an RV, I can lock the door and the dogs are safe, too.\u201d Eakin feels comfortable enough now to leave from time to time to work odd jobs. He has a community of other RV dwellers. And he has a band, Grape Soda, with two of them. Their cramped studio is set up in one of their RVs, complete with a drum kit, guitars and a sound mixer. But he\u2019s tired. \u201cIt just gets old,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shower is broken at the moment. The gray water tank leaks, and so does the supply line. It would just be nice to be stable.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s one step from living hard on the streets\u2019 Aid workers say the needs of RV dwellers are divergent. Many vehicle dwellers don\u2019t consider themselves homeless, and therefore don\u2019t know of the resources available. \u201cThere are people who are extremely sick and living in extremely bad conditions,\u201d said Kositsky, the head of San Francisco\u2019s department of homelessness and supportive housing. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about hoarding and cluttering, black water leaking into the streets, mold inside these vehicles that don\u2019t move. They\u2019re using it as a metal tent. They\u2019re not as visible and they can be in their vehicles, really sick, and no one will really know.\u201d But in a recent survey, the department also found that 25% of people living out of their vehicles had homes elsewhere. They were what local economists call \u201csuper commuters\u201d \u2013 individuals who drive up to hundreds of miles into the city for the work week, returning on the weekends to their home areas where housing is more affordable. Some are Uber and Lyft drivers. Most are contractors, in some form. \u201cOur overall summary of this is that we think that at least half of the people need help, but at least half of the people do not need the kind of help that our department is able to offer,\u201d Kositsky said. Short of a quick fix for the housing crisis that fuels the rise in homelessness, lawmakers have struggled to come up with policies to address the problem. On one hand, a car provides more security and safety for the individual, and attracts fewer complaints than tent encampments or the more visibly homeless. But still, constituents complain about vehicle dwellers. They take up valuable parking spaces. They leak gasoline and sewage. And in general, trash pickup doesn\u2019t exist for people living in cars. Not every individual has a working bathroom. Cities around the region have considered some form of prohibiting oversized vehicles from overnight parking, efforts that homeless advocates have opposed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cycle where they\u2019re shuffling people around and not creating places to go,\u201d said Cutler of the Coalition on Homelessness. The criminalization of vehicles also result in people\u2019s homes getting ticketed or worse, towed with all their belongings \u2013 and more often than not, the individuals don\u2019t have the funds to retrieve their cars out of impound. \u201cWhen people are living in their vehicles, it\u2019s one step from having to sleep hard on the street, and it\u2019s one step from stable housing,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely detrimental when they lose their vehicle.\u201d Vallie Brown came into office as a San Francisco supervisor in 2018 and found the other supervisors asking for bans on certain streets in their districts. The approach did not sit well with her. When Supervisor Ahsha Safa\u00ed proposed a ban in his district, Brown dug up the old photo of her in the van. \u201cI took it to him, and I said, \u2018Supervisor Safa\u00ed, this is me. You don\u2019t know who is living in these vans. It can be someone like myself. Can we work together and think of another way?\u2019\u201d They came back with a pilot program for the first safe parking site in San Francisco. They had to change planning, police and administration codes \u2013 in the city, it\u2019s illegal to sleep in one\u2019s car. Across the bay, Oakland is expanding its first safe parking site, and working to establish its second. Berkeley, which banned overnight parking of RVs citywide in February, is now talking about opening its first. These sites will have security, bathrooms, showers and social services. People should be able to feel safe to leave their vehicles, and go to work. The sites are not lacking in criticism. They can only take a limited amount of vehicles for a limited amount of time \u2013 in San Francisco, individuals can only stay 90 days. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d Cutler said \u2013 especially when the driving force behind the crisis is a lack of affordable housing. \u201cThis is an issue because there isn\u2019t adequate housing,\u201d she said. Oakland officials announced last month that they would be cleaning out the Community of Grace encampment, where Roberto Lopez lives, and move the residents to shelters and an RV safe parking site when they become available. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of community there, and that\u2019s good,\u201d said Joe DeVries, an assistant to the Oakland city administrator. \u201cOn the flip side, unregulated encampments always lead to problems. There are no fixed rules and no accountability.\u201d \u2018Let\u2019s get people off the streets\u2019 It\u2019s hard for Brown to talk about her time living out of a van because she knows how embarrassed and ashamed her mother felt about it. \u201cShe would tell us not to tell people,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was afraid people would think she couldn\u2019t take care of her girls.\u201d Her mother was working two full-time jobs at the time of her death \u2013 when Brown was 14 \u2013 and Brown knows many of the families still living out of their vehicles in California today are in the same situation. \u201cFor me, it was always a feeling that she did the best she could,\u201d Brown said. \u201cLife can be tough when you don\u2019t have money and you don\u2019t have a way out.\u201d It\u2019s frustrating for her to walk the streets of her district and see families living the same reality she lived so many years ago with her family. All Brown can do now is work to change this reality. \u201cI think a lot of times, we don\u2019t know exactly what will work until we try it,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m willing to try all new things. Let\u2019s get people off the streets.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Day one</h2> \n<p>As I write this, squashed into the armpit of a city worker on the Central line in London, I am \u2013 on balance \u2013 terrified. Director Ed Madden and I have been working on A Table Tennis Play for a year. It\u2019s an idea we\u2019ve chatted about since our first show (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/15/lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-review-edinburgh-festival-southside-walrus-theatre\">Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons</a>), in 2015. But as my warm, shallow exhalations echo around the concave landscape of this stranger\u2019s underarm, I worry the play might be at best underdeveloped and at worst innately, inescapably fucked.</p> \n<p>Set across a weekend, it follows a woman who, boyfriend in tow, returns to her childhood home to clear out the basement and forms a strange, fleeting bond with the 18-year-old tennis prodigy who now lives in the house. The action unfolds around a knackered old table-tennis table.</p> \n<p>In early drafts, the table tennis action was near constant. We\u2019ve pared it back, but the key moments revolve around the actors batting a ball back and forth in a particular manner. Nothing like a challenge!</p> \n<p>We kicked off rehearsals with a read-through. Hearing it out aloud for the first time feels like that bit in The Wizard of Oz when it goes from black-and-white to colour. The great relief is that our actors \u2013 Rosa Robson, Beth Holmes and Euan Kitson \u2013 can all play table tennis pretty well. Decent, long rallies. You don\u2019t want the audience sitting there thinking \u201cI could beat them\u201d instead of engaging with the story.</p> \n<p>Lizzy Leech talked us through her set design. It is imaginative, smart and involves several thousand table-tennis balls.</p> \n<h2>Day three</h2> \n<p>The current draft is hovering above the real drama of the thing. I wonder if I\u2019m overvaluing subtlety or ambiguity and undervaluing more explicit, muscular conflict. But then I remember that the most dramatic<em> </em>moments in my life, in my friends\u2019 lives, have rarely involved shouting and screaming.</p> \n<p>We\u2019re rehearsing in the Orange room in the Nursery Training Centre near London Bridge. Occasionally, we hear a smattering of improvised Shakespeare, a gargle of \u201cMEMORY ALL ALONE IN THE MOONLIGHT\u201d, or see a naked buttock pass by a door. The Turquoise room is only accessible through our space, so we\u2019ve made friends with the group there, who apologetically tiptoe through our rehearsals whenever they need the loo. One of them looks like Michael Palin.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9591aed01e5ae0d29468440e0f52e730800ee0d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9591aed01e5ae0d29468440e0f52e730800ee0d/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa Robson, Beth Holmes and Euan Kitson in rehearsals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Earning the scene \u2026 Rosa Robson, Beth Holmes and Euan Kitson in rehearsals</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Day four</h2> \n<p>We worked on the middle scene. The actors found something really tender and sensitive, and it felt as if a weight lifted in the room. Ed and I caught one another\u2019s eyes with a look that said: <em>phew. </em>Now the job is to earn that scene in the first half of the play and properly pay it off in the second. When I reflect on what semblance of a \u201cprocess\u201d I have, it often boils down to this: imagining a moment that is funny, or emotionally or thematically potent, then figuring out what needs to happen to make that moment as powerful as possible. The man who isn\u2019t Michael Palin gave us a big wave and a smile today.</p> \n<h2>Day five</h2> \n<p>No actors in today. Ed and I tried to fix the play. Over the last few years we\u2019ve developed a good shorthand. This is useful because we\u2019re aiming at something tonally specific. We spent a load of time talking about how a scene that currently \u201czigs\u201d needs to do more of a \u201czag\u201d. This is nonsense but also saved the play.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"00129b8829888d4ee43edd09ca18377a6543de86\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00129b8829888d4ee43edd09ca18377a6543de86/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Table Tennis Play at Edinburgh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My first drafts are weird, my seconds sad and my thirds funny\u2019 \u2026 A Table Tennis Play at Edinburgh</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Day nine</h2> \n<p>We blind \u201ctech-ed: the show with our sound and lighting designers. Since this a fringe show, we have four hours in total. So Ed, sound designer Richard Bell, lighting designer Charlotte Burton and I sat round and talked through, blindly, each cue in the play. While this is obviously not ideal, there was something oddly lovely about it. Like, in order to combat our limited resources, we were engaging in a communal act of imagination. Which is exactly what we do at the theatre.</p> \n<h2>Day 10</h2> \n<p>Our first run. The actors were absolute heroes. Richard came in and laughed at all the right moments. I therefore now love him more than I have ever loved anyone ever. (Sorry Mum.)</p> \n<p>The main thing we learned is that a big moment in the middle of the play has to be moved to the end. This is not as chronologically jumpy as it sounds. Ed and I love set pieces but you\u2019re probably only allowed one in an hour-long show.</p> \n<h2>Day 13</h2> \n<p>Another new draft. We need more of a sense of one character\u2019s day-to-day life outside of this particular weekend. It\u2019s difficult without getting too horribly exposition-y. The trick is to embed it in action.</p> \n<p>This is my fourth play. My first drafts are weird, my seconds sad and my thirds funny. Or are trying to be. First drafts are splurges of inspiration that don\u2019t fit together. The ones that follow sometimes feel as if they are screaming \u201cTHIS IS SERIOUS, TAKE IT SERIOUSLY\u201d. The fourth draft is about texturing the thing. Seriousness doesn\u2019t have an impact if it\u2019s relentless.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a cliche, but I started writing plays when I realised being a songwriter/rockstar wasn\u2019t going to pan out. I still think of plays like songs or albums. I did a play earlier in the year with Paines Plough and Theatre Royal Plymouth called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/13/you-stupid-darkness-review-sam-steiner-the-drum-plymouth\">You Stupid Darkness!</a> A Table Tennis Play is like its B-side. That play was major key and hummable; this one feels minor key and more mysterious.</p> \n<p>On a slightly distressing note, our table tennis balls are stuck in China.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2881df1a59a5aa9544b2519dade219884025ff2b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2881df1a59a5aa9544b2519dade219884025ff2b/0_0_2535_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You Stupid Darkness! at Theatre Royal Plymouth in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More major key \u2026 You Stupid Darkness! at Theatre Royal Plymouth in February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Austin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Day 14</h2> \n<p>This was the Hot Day. Just when it feels as if this little fringe show is the BE ALL AND END ALL, Boris Johnson becomes prime minister and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/02/record-heatwave-made-much-more-likely-by-human-impact-on-climate\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/02/record-heatwave-made-much-more-likely-by-human-impact-on-climate\">temperature hits 39 degrees</a>.</p> \n<p>We did another run. In our non-air-conditioned room/volcano. The script changes have been hard on the actors, but they\u2019ve already got most of the lines down. I hope the play gives them the showcase they deserve.</p> \n<p>Ed and I picked up light fixtures for the set from the London Palladium just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/12/joseph-and-the-amazing-technicolor-dreamcoat-review-sheridan-smith-jason-donovan\">Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</a> was ending. We emerged from stage door to be greeted by around 50 Jason Donovan fans, who could not have been more disappointed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

\n</figure> \n<h2>To Edinburgh!</h2> \n<p>Lizzy, Ed and Rosa drove the set up from London in a hired van. It took them 10 hours. Kudos.</p> \n<p>I pulled off my third all-nighter in three weeks doing another (final) pass of the script before sending an apologetic email to my wonderful publishers, Nick Hern Books. We\u2019ve restructured the middle section to make one of the characters\u2019 journeys clearer.</p> \n<h2>Tech</h2> \n<p>We go into tech like it\u2019s a World Cup final or a battle to the death, powered on caffeine and overblown metaphors. We speed through, just about get it down in time and retreat to the pub.</p> \n<h2>Preview one</h2> \n<p>We got through it! Rosa described the show as feeling like a cat dragging its claws through a set of curtains. The curtains being her brain.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s strange how different the play feels in the actual space \u2013 how much the tone has shifted. I hope we can marry the intimacy we found in that rehearsal room with the production values of the theatre.</p> \n<h2>Preview two</h2> \n<p>A huge leap forward. The actors are enjoying themselves more. It\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019ll keep improving.</p> \n<p>As I walk back through the Edinburgh meadows before the festival officially starts, I feel lucky. So little of a writer\u2019s life is spent in the rehearsal room. And so much of that time is spent worrying that the thing you\u2019ve worked so hard on might not have the space or resources to become all you wanted it to be. It\u2019s important to step back and remember: a team of searching, talented actors are working with a brilliant director and a cracking creative team to bring something I\u2019ve written into the world. And at this moment, thousands of people around this city are having a similar yet entirely different experience.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/table-tennis-play\">A Table Tennis Play</a> is at Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 25 August</p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2019+tone/reviews\">Read all our Edinburgh festival coverage</a></p></li> \n</ul>",

      "bodyText": "Day one As I write this, squashed into the armpit of a city worker on the Central line in London, I am \u2013 on balance \u2013 terrified. Director Ed Madden and I have been working on A Table Tennis Play for a year. It\u2019s an idea we\u2019ve chatted about since our first show (Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons), in 2015. But as my warm, shallow exhalations echo around the concave landscape of this stranger\u2019s underarm, I worry the play might be at best underdeveloped and at worst innately, inescapably fucked. Set across a weekend, it follows a woman who, boyfriend in tow, returns to her childhood home to clear out the basement and forms a strange, fleeting bond with the 18-year-old tennis prodigy who now lives in the house. The action unfolds around a knackered old table-tennis table. In early drafts, the table tennis action was near constant. We\u2019ve pared it back, but the key moments revolve around the actors batting a ball back and forth in a particular manner. Nothing like a challenge! We kicked off rehearsals with a read-through. Hearing it out aloud for the first time feels like that bit in The Wizard of Oz when it goes from black-and-white to colour. The great relief is that our actors \u2013 Rosa Robson, Beth Holmes and Euan Kitson \u2013 can all play table tennis pretty well. Decent, long rallies. You don\u2019t want the audience sitting there thinking \u201cI could beat them\u201d instead of engaging with the story. Lizzy Leech talked us through her set design. It is imaginative, smart and involves several thousand table-tennis balls. Day three The current draft is hovering above the real drama of the thing. I wonder if I\u2019m overvaluing subtlety or ambiguity and undervaluing more explicit, muscular conflict. But then I remember that the most dramatic moments in my life, in my friends\u2019 lives, have rarely involved shouting and screaming. We\u2019re rehearsing in the Orange room in the Nursery Training Centre near London Bridge. Occasionally, we hear a smattering of improvised Shakespeare, a gargle of \u201cMEMORY ALL ALONE IN THE MOONLIGHT\u201d, or see a naked buttock pass by a door. The Turquoise room is only accessible through our space, so we\u2019ve made friends with the group there, who apologetically tiptoe through our rehearsals whenever they need the loo. One of them looks like Michael Palin. Day four We worked on the middle scene. The actors found something really tender and sensitive, and it felt as if a weight lifted in the room. Ed and I caught one another\u2019s eyes with a look that said: phew. Now the job is to earn that scene in the first half of the play and properly pay it off in the second. When I reflect on what semblance of a \u201cprocess\u201d I have, it often boils down to this: imagining a moment that is funny, or emotionally or thematically potent, then figuring out what needs to happen to make that moment as powerful as possible. The man who isn\u2019t Michael Palin gave us a big wave and a smile today. Day five No actors in today. Ed and I tried to fix the play. Over the last few years we\u2019ve developed a good shorthand. This is useful because we\u2019re aiming at something tonally specific. We spent a load of time talking about how a scene that currently \u201czigs\u201d needs to do more of a \u201czag\u201d. This is nonsense but also saved the play. Day nine We blind \u201ctech-ed: the show with our sound and lighting designers. Since this a fringe show, we have four hours in total. So Ed, sound designer Richard Bell, lighting designer Charlotte Burton and I sat round and talked through, blindly, each cue in the play. While this is obviously not ideal, there was something oddly lovely about it. Like, in order to combat our limited resources, we were engaging in a communal act of imagination. Which is exactly what we do at the theatre. Day 10 Our first run. The actors were absolute heroes. Richard came in and laughed at all the right moments. I therefore now love him more than I have ever loved anyone ever. (Sorry Mum.) The main thing we learned is that a big moment in the middle of the play has to be moved to the end. This is not as chronologically jumpy as it sounds. Ed and I love set pieces but you\u2019re probably only allowed one in an hour-long show. Day 13 Another new draft. We need more of a sense of one character\u2019s day-to-day life outside of this particular weekend. It\u2019s difficult without getting too horribly exposition-y. The trick is to embed it in action. This is my fourth play. My first drafts are weird, my seconds sad and my thirds funny. Or are trying to be. First drafts are splurges of inspiration that don\u2019t fit together. The ones that follow sometimes feel as if they are screaming \u201cTHIS IS SERIOUS, TAKE IT SERIOUSLY\u201d. The fourth draft is about texturing the thing. Seriousness doesn\u2019t have an impact if it\u2019s relentless. It\u2019s a cliche, but I started writing plays when I realised being a songwriter/rockstar wasn\u2019t going to pan out. I still think of plays like songs or albums. I did a play earlier in the year with Paines Plough and Theatre Royal Plymouth called You Stupid Darkness! A Table Tennis Play is like its B-side. That play was major key and hummable; this one feels minor key and more mysterious. On a slightly distressing note, our table tennis balls are stuck in China. Day 14 This was the Hot Day. Just when it feels as if this little fringe show is the BE ALL AND END ALL, Boris Johnson becomes prime minister and the temperature hits 39 degrees. We did another run. In our non-air-conditioned room/volcano. The script changes have been hard on the actors, but they\u2019ve already got most of the lines down. I hope the play gives them the showcase they deserve. Ed and I picked up light fixtures for the set from the London Palladium just as Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was ending. We emerged from stage door to be greeted by around 50 Jason Donovan fans, who could not have been more disappointed. To Edinburgh! Lizzy, Ed and Rosa drove the set up from London in a hired van. It took them 10 hours. Kudos. I pulled off my third all-nighter in three weeks doing another (final) pass of the script before sending an apologetic email to my wonderful publishers, Nick Hern Books. We\u2019ve restructured the middle section to make one of the characters\u2019 journeys clearer. Tech We go into tech like it\u2019s a World Cup final or a battle to the death, powered on caffeine and overblown metaphors. We speed through, just about get it down in time and retreat to the pub. Preview one We got through it! Rosa described the show as feeling like a cat dragging its claws through a set of curtains. The curtains being her brain. It\u2019s strange how different the play feels in the actual space \u2013 how much the tone has shifted. I hope we can marry the intimacy we found in that rehearsal room with the production values of the theatre. Preview two A huge leap forward. The actors are enjoying themselves more. It\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019ll keep improving. As I walk back through the Edinburgh meadows before the festival officially starts, I feel lucky. So little of a writer\u2019s life is spent in the rehearsal room. And so much of that time is spent worrying that the thing you\u2019ve worked so hard on might not have the space or resources to become all you wanted it to be. It\u2019s important to step back and remember: a team of searching, talented actors are working with a brilliant director and a cracking creative team to bring something I\u2019ve written into the world. And at this moment, thousands of people around this city are having a similar yet entirely different experience.

      "bodyText": "EU citizens are being made homeless and destitute after being turned down for universal credit despite having the legal right to reside in the UK, in what critics are calling the benefit system\u2019s very own \u201chostile environment\u201d. Ministers are being urged to review \u201cunfair practices\u201d after law centres and welfare advisers reported a surge in cases in which EU nationals without UK citizenship have ended up in debt or sleeping rough because of incorrect decisions to refuse their application for universal credit that cut off their benefits overnight. Claimants who challenge the decision typically have to wait up to 40 weeks for an appeal hearing. Welfare advisers say they win their the appeal in almost all cases, resulting in back payments of thousands of pounds. However, during the wait for an appeal claimants struggle to pay rent as the claim for universal credit automatically ends previous awards, including housing benefit. With zero income, they experience stress, eviction and debt, and rely on family loans and food banks to survive.

      "body": "<p>You know those people who get up at 4am to do yoga and write 2,000 words of their novel before heading off to a high-powered job?</p> <p>Well, I\u2019m not one of those. My mornings usually involve hitting the snooze button as many times I can before my exasperated girlfriend physically pulls me out of bed. I\u2019m good at focusing when I have an imminent deadline, otherwise I find myself spending half the day Googling \u201cways to stop procrastinating\u201d and singing to my dog.</p> <p>Recently, I decided I\u2019d had enough; I was going to spend a busy week doing every productivity hack I could find and see if I could turn myself into one of those uber-efficient weirdos you read about in magazines.</p> <p>My experiment has now concluded (thank God). Here\u2019s a rundown of what worked, what sort of worked, and what you probably shouldn\u2019t try yourself at home.</p> <h2><strong>1. Self-hypnosis</strong></h2> <p>I thought I\u2019d kick things off my quest for productivity by hypnotizing myself into taking up more effective habits. While hypnosis may conjure up images of cruise-ship magicians, <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2016/07/study-identifies-brain-areas-altered-during-hypnotic-trances.html\">a study by Stanford researchers</a> found that the brain really does work differently under hypnosis and there\u2019s growing consensus that it can be an effective way to \u201creprogram\u201d your thinking.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have any Stanford scientists on hand to hypnotize me so I had to try the DIY technique. Self-hypnosis, alas, is a lot less exciting than it sounds. It\u2019s a form of meditation where you put yourself in a deep state of focus and then reprogram your mind by repeating corny self-affirmations such as \u201cmy drive and ambition allow me to achieve my goals\u201d.</p> <p>Some people swear that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/happylist/how-self-hypnosis-changed-my-life-a7980306.html\">self-hypnosis has changed their life</a> but, unfortunately, my attention-span is too low and my cynicism levels too high for it to really be effective.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong><em> </em>C+. I wouldn\u2019t rule out trying this again but it\u2019s definitely not a quick fix. Also, don\u2019t try this in a public space like I did or you will look like a right knob.</p> <h2><strong>2. Virtual co-working</strong></h2> <p>I work from home a lot. In order to stop myself from binge-watching Netflix all day, I\u2019ve found it useful to set up remote work dates with other freelancer friends. We text each other our goals, have a timed work \u201csprint\u201d, and check in with each other at the end.</p> <p>For my experiment I decided to up the ante and try a (currently free) service called <a href=\"https://www.focusmate.com/\">Focusmate</a> that lets you virtually co-work with strangers. You introduce yourself at the beginning of a 50-minute session and share goals; then you keep your cameras connected while you work, keeping an eye on each other. I was a little creeped out by the idea, but it\u2019s actually not as weird as it sounds. In fact, I found the set-up even more effective than checking in with a friend via text \u2013 it\u2019s a lot more difficult to lie.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong><em> </em>A+. As more people go freelance and remote work becomes the norm, I can only imagine that virtual co-working services are going to boom.</p> <h2><strong>3. Listening to a video game soundtrack</strong></h2> <p>There are <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/music-only-helps-you-concentrate-if-youre-doing-the-right-kind-of-task-86952\">numerous conflicting studie</a>s about whether background music helps you focus. I\u2019ve tried following the advice from all these with limited success.</p> <p>I hit gold, however, when I found an <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/work-productivity-listening-music/\">article in Popular Science</a> in which the writer claims listening to music from video games when you need to focus was \u201cby far, the best Life Pro Tip I\u2019ve ever gotten or given.\u201d That\u2019s a bold claim but I\u2019m now inclined to agree. Video game music is the perfect get-stuff-done soundtrack because it is specifically designed not to distract you. It can also make you feel like you\u2019re completing an important quest rather than just trying to do your damn expenses.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong><em> </em>A. Definitely think it helped. I\u2019m still trialling different soundtracks but I can recommend Battlefield 1 and The Sims if you want to give it a go.</p> <h2><strong>4. Guzzling a brain drink</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s been a recent <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/01/11/1690384/0/en/Global-Nootropics-Market-Will-Reach-USD-5-959-Million-By-2024-Zion-Market-Research.html\">boom in nootropics</a>, non-prescription \u201csmart drugs\u201d that promise to boost your brain power.</p> <p>If a magic brain pill sounds too good to be true it\u2019s because it is; most nootropics are snake oil and some <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/\">can be downright dangerous</a>. Nevertheless, I thought I might as well try a brain supplement and reached out to <a href=\"https://www.braingear.me/\">BrainGear</a>, a new drink that promises to \u201clift brain fog\u201d. Speaking over the phone, the founder assured me it is absolutely not a nootropic, and is scientifically backed by neurologists from Stanford University and UT Austin. She sent me six small bottles in the mail and I diligently chugged them every morning. I did feel a little more mental clarity, but I think that may be down to the placebo effect and the power of a regular morning ritual rather than any magic formula.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: B</strong>. I think most nootropics are a waste of money. However, it\u2019s possible that taking supplements might be beneficial if, like me, you largely subsist on a weird Freelancer Diet of potato chips, yoghurt and coffee.</p> <h2><strong>5. Microdosing amphetamines</strong></h2> <p>Microdosing LSD to boost productivity has been all the rage in Silicon Valley for years. I\u2019ve been tempted to try it but I haven\u2019t because LSD is illegal and I\u2019m brown. Weirdly, you only seem to get away with boasting about doing illegal things if you\u2019re white. You know what\u2019s not illegal though? Taking Adderall because you have been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) by your doctor.</p> <p>Any Americans reading this will know what Adderall is but if you\u2019re not from the United States then Adderall is basically cocaine in prescription form. (Drugs are totally fine when they make pharmaceutical companies huge profits, you see.) It\u2019s used to treat people who have ADD but is also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/magazine/generation-adderall-addiction.html\">abused by huge amounts of people who don\u2019t have ADD</a> and just want to focus. I tried microdosing it this week to see if it would help kick my brain into gear. It made me feel a little nauseous but was great for powering through boring tasks. It did not, however, do anything for my creativity or improve my thinking in any way.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>Please only take Adderall if you have ADD, I am not trying to get deported here.</p> <h2><strong>6. Personal Kanban</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve downloaded numerous productivity apps and they all seem to be a lot more trouble than they\u2019re worth. The best tech for time-management, I think, is good old-fashioned Post-it notes. However, I was going a little bit overboard with the Post-it notes (my wall looked like a slightly psychotic piece of modern art) until I read about the \u201cpersonal Kanban\u201d technique in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/05/how-to-tackle-your-to-do-lists-oliver-burkeman\">Oliver Burkeman\u2019s Guardian column</a>.</p> <p>This involves limiting your work-in-progress to a small number of tasks. Using Post-it notes you visualize your to-do list in three columns: to do, doing, and done. There should be never be more than three tasks in \u201cdoing\u201d. While this sounds ridiculously simple it\u2019s a surprisingly effective way to stop yourself doing multiple things at once and getting overwhelmed.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong><em> </em>B+. My house looks a lot less strange.</p> <h2><strong>7. Superspeed your podcasts and audiobooks</strong></h2> <p>My girlfriend once accidentally pressed the button that makes podcasts play at 1.5x speed. She didn\u2019t realize such a button existed and just thought the new trend in podcasts was people talking like chipmunks in order to get through more material quickly.</p> <p>When she informed me of this, I made fun of her for a very long time. Turns out she\u2019s getting the last laugh as speeding up your podcasts is actually <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-do-podcast-nuts-find-the-time-they-listen-at-chipmunk-speed-1499957591\">all the rage among</a><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-do-podcast-nuts-find-the-time-they-listen-at-chipmunk-speed-1499957591\"> efficiency nerds</a>. There are even special apps that let you accelerate voices to 5x speed \u2013 which is ridiculous. I\u2019ve spent the week trying out 1.5x speed; you get used to it very quickly and can tear through a lot more content.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>A-. I still prefer listening at normal speed but this is definitely more efficient. Not going to tell my girlfriend that though.</p> <h2><strong>8. Hot yoga</strong></h2> <p>Do you know how exhausting trying to be productive is? Extremely. It\u2019s so exhausting that I couldn\u2019t summon up the energy to start writing this article until a few hours before my deadline.</p> <p>That\u2019s OK, I thought, I\u2019m a pro at getting things done now. Turns out that\u2019s not actually true: my deadline whizzed by and, in a panic, I emailed my editor to tell her I was going to have to go to hot yoga (like a basic influencer) instead of filing on time.</p> <p>I used to sneer at people who did hot yoga but, to my chagrin, I have found it an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/01/bikram-yoga-refreshes-mind-and-body-laura-barton\">amazing</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/01/bikram-yoga-refreshes-mind-and-body-laura-barton\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/01/bikram-yoga-refreshes-mind-and-body-laura-barton\">stress-reliever</a>. We live in a world obsessed with productivity, but sometimes you really need to focus on your inner self rather than your output.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>I don\u2019t really think that judgmental grades align with yoga. Namaste positive here.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You know those people who get up at 4am to do yoga and write 2,000 words of their novel before heading off to a high-powered job? Well, I\u2019m not one of those. My mornings usually involve hitting the snooze button as many times I can before my exasperated girlfriend physically pulls me out of bed. I\u2019m good at focusing when I have an imminent deadline, otherwise I find myself spending half the day Googling \u201cways to stop procrastinating\u201d and singing to my dog. Recently, I decided I\u2019d had enough; I was going to spend a busy week doing every productivity hack I could find and see if I could turn myself into one of those uber-efficient weirdos you read about in magazines. My experiment has now concluded (thank God). Here\u2019s a rundown of what worked, what sort of worked, and what you probably shouldn\u2019t try yourself at home. 1. Self-hypnosis I thought I\u2019d kick things off my quest for productivity by hypnotizing myself into taking up more effective habits. While hypnosis may conjure up images of cruise-ship magicians, a study by Stanford researchers found that the brain really does work differently under hypnosis and there\u2019s growing consensus that it can be an effective way to \u201creprogram\u201d your thinking. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have any Stanford scientists on hand to hypnotize me so I had to try the DIY technique. Self-hypnosis, alas, is a lot less exciting than it sounds. It\u2019s a form of meditation where you put yourself in a deep state of focus and then reprogram your mind by repeating corny self-affirmations such as \u201cmy drive and ambition allow me to achieve my goals\u201d. Some people swear that self-hypnosis has changed their life but, unfortunately, my attention-span is too low and my cynicism levels too high for it to really be effective. Verdict: C+. I wouldn\u2019t rule out trying this again but it\u2019s definitely not a quick fix. Also, don\u2019t try this in a public space like I did or you will look like a right knob. 2. Virtual co-working I work from home a lot. In order to stop myself from binge-watching Netflix all day, I\u2019ve found it useful to set up remote work dates with other freelancer friends. We text each other our goals, have a timed work \u201csprint\u201d, and check in with each other at the end. For my experiment I decided to up the ante and try a (currently free) service called Focusmate that lets you virtually co-work with strangers. You introduce yourself at the beginning of a 50-minute session and share goals; then you keep your cameras connected while you work, keeping an eye on each other. I was a little creeped out by the idea, but it\u2019s actually not as weird as it sounds. In fact, I found the set-up even more effective than checking in with a friend via text \u2013 it\u2019s a lot more difficult to lie. Verdict: A+. As more people go freelance and remote work becomes the norm, I can only imagine that virtual co-working services are going to boom. 3. Listening to a video game soundtrack There are numerous conflicting studies about whether background music helps you focus. I\u2019ve tried following the advice from all these with limited success. I hit gold, however, when I found an article in Popular Science in which the writer claims listening to music from video games when you need to focus was \u201cby far, the best Life Pro Tip I\u2019ve ever gotten or given.\u201d That\u2019s a bold claim but I\u2019m now inclined to agree. Video game music is the perfect get-stuff-done soundtrack because it is specifically designed not to distract you. It can also make you feel like you\u2019re completing an important quest rather than just trying to do your damn expenses. Verdict: A. Definitely think it helped. I\u2019m still trialling different soundtracks but I can recommend Battlefield 1 and The Sims if you want to give it a go. 4. Guzzling a brain drink There\u2019s been a recent boom in nootropics, non-prescription \u201csmart drugs\u201d that promise to boost your brain power. If a magic brain pill sounds too good to be true it\u2019s because it is; most nootropics are snake oil and some can be downright dangerous. Nevertheless, I thought I might as well try a brain supplement and reached out to BrainGear, a new drink that promises to \u201clift brain fog\u201d. Speaking over the phone, the founder assured me it is absolutely not a nootropic, and is scientifically backed by neurologists from Stanford University and UT Austin. She sent me six small bottles in the mail and I diligently chugged them every morning. I did feel a little more mental clarity, but I think that may be down to the placebo effect and the power of a regular morning ritual rather than any magic formula. Verdict: B. I think most nootropics are a waste of money. However, it\u2019s possible that taking supplements might be beneficial if, like me, you largely subsist on a weird Freelancer Diet of potato chips, yoghurt and coffee. 5. Microdosing amphetamines Microdosing LSD to boost productivity has been all the rage in Silicon Valley for years. I\u2019ve been tempted to try it but I haven\u2019t because LSD is illegal and I\u2019m brown. Weirdly, you only seem to get away with boasting about doing illegal things if you\u2019re white. You know what\u2019s not illegal though? Taking Adderall because you have been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) by your doctor. Any Americans reading this will know what Adderall is but if you\u2019re not from the United States then Adderall is basically cocaine in prescription form. (Drugs are totally fine when they make pharmaceutical companies huge profits, you see.) It\u2019s used to treat people who have ADD but is also abused by huge amounts of people who don\u2019t have ADD and just want to focus. I tried microdosing it this week to see if it would help kick my brain into gear. It made me feel a little nauseous but was great for powering through boring tasks. It did not, however, do anything for my creativity or improve my thinking in any way. Verdict: Please only take Adderall if you have ADD, I am not trying to get deported here. 6. Personal Kanban I\u2019ve downloaded numerous productivity apps and they all seem to be a lot more trouble than they\u2019re worth. The best tech for time-management, I think, is good old-fashioned Post-it notes. However, I was going a little bit overboard with the Post-it notes (my wall looked like a slightly psychotic piece of modern art) until I read about the \u201cpersonal Kanban\u201d technique in Oliver Burkeman\u2019s Guardian column. This involves limiting your work-in-progress to a small number of tasks. Using Post-it notes you visualize your to-do list in three columns: to do, doing, and done. There should be never be more than three tasks in \u201cdoing\u201d. While this sounds ridiculously simple it\u2019s a surprisingly effective way to stop yourself doing multiple things at once and getting overwhelmed. Verdict: B+. My house looks a lot less strange. 7. Superspeed your podcasts and audiobooks My girlfriend once accidentally pressed the button that makes podcasts play at 1.5x speed. She didn\u2019t realize such a button existed and just thought the new trend in podcasts was people talking like chipmunks in order to get through more material quickly. When she informed me of this, I made fun of her for a very long time. Turns out she\u2019s getting the last laugh as speeding up your podcasts is actually all the rage among efficiency nerds. There are even special apps that let you accelerate voices to 5x speed \u2013 which is ridiculous. I\u2019ve spent the week trying out 1.5x speed; you get used to it very quickly and can tear through a lot more content. Verdict: A-. I still prefer listening at normal speed but this is definitely more efficient. Not going to tell my girlfriend that though. 8. Hot yoga Do you know how exhausting trying to be productive is? Extremely. It\u2019s so exhausting that I couldn\u2019t summon up the energy to start writing this article until a few hours before my deadline. That\u2019s OK, I thought, I\u2019m a pro at getting things done now. Turns out that\u2019s not actually true: my deadline whizzed by and, in a panic, I emailed my editor to tell her I was going to have to go to hot yoga (like a basic influencer) instead of filing on time. I used to sneer at people who did hot yoga but, to my chagrin, I have found it an amazing stress-reliever. We live in a world obsessed with productivity, but sometimes you really need to focus on your inner self rather than your output. Verdict: I don\u2019t really think that judgmental grades align with yoga. Namaste positive here.",

Last month, Noel accused Liam of \u201cintimidating women\u201d after posting screenshots allegedly showing aggressive texts sent to Noel\u2019s teenage daughter, Ana\u00efs.

It follows Black Star Dancing, his Nile Rodgers-approved disco single. That saw him throw away the shackles of the guitar-led sound that once dominated his career as it moved from incredible peaks \u2013 those glorious first Oasis albums, whose melodic euphoria led to generation-defining gigs at Knebworth in 1996 \u2013 to the troughs, in which the band became plodding and predictable, only to implode with a blazing backstage row before a gig in Paris in 2009.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e7aa9644b955de633e41fb8774967714dd6df00e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7aa9644b955de633e41fb8774967714dd6df00e/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stormzy on stage at Glastonbury earlier this year, and Gallagher on stage at Maine Road in 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stormzy on stage at Glastonbury earlier this year, and Gallagher on stage at Maine Road in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Yui Mok/PA; Patrick Ford/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gallagher admits to being \u201cset in my ways\u201d, but it sounds like he is having fun writing music again.

This Is the Place (the title is taken from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/may/23/mancunians-forever-tony-walsh-reads-poem-manchester-vigil-video\" title=\"\">Tony Walsh\u2019s poem</a> to Manchester, read aloud in Albert Square after the Manchester arena bombing) takes a space-rock journey through Ian Brown, Primal Scream and the Smiths, and it is almost frustrating it has taken him so long to get here. You wonder how things might have panned out if he had written more adventurous songs like these for Oasis back in the late 90s.</p> <p>\u201cWell, for a start, Liam wouldn\u2019t fucking sing them,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause he famously said to me one night [adopts parody of Liam\u2019s voice]: \u2018I don\u2019t like quirky weird things ...\u2019 and I was like: \u2018Oh OK, well this is going to be fun then.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Gallagher says there is a new generation of Oasis fans that have come along following the 2016 documentary Supersonic \u2013 and they are not always open to his more experimental leanings, either. \u201cI love winding them up,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d love to be in the room when they heard this [new EP] for the first time.\u201d He has a knack for winding people up, and not just with his music. Lately, he has been enraging remainers \u2013 of which he is one \u2013 by saying: \u201cThere\u2019s only one fucking thing worse than a fool who voted for Brexit, and that\u2019s the rise of the cunts trying to get the vote overturned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd people started calling me a Nazi!\u201d he says. \u201cI thought: \u2018Really? A member of the Third Reich?\u2019 Look, I think it\u2019s ridiculous that we\u2019re leaving. None of us were even qualified to vote. You ask a guy above a chippy in Bradford if we should leave Europe. \u2018Yeah!\u2019 But I still think if there\u2019s a second referendum, as a nation, we\u2019ll never recover. We have to come out because, no matter how ill-informed people were, you\u2019re saying to them their vote doesn\u2019t count. And its symptomatic of shutting people\u2019s opinions down.\u201d</p> <p>Oasis were renowned for drunken debauchery, bust-ups and brawls, but what is often forgotten is the spirit of togetherness they fostered. While their Britpop rivals Blur examined the country\u2019s condition with lofty detachment, Oasis were all about the collective experience. Noel says he has the Hacienda and rave culture to thank for it.</p> <p>\u201cAcid house changed my life,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look at the words to those songs ... it\u2019s all about unity, \u2018us\u2019, the whole communal thing. So when I started writing songs, instinctively, that\u2019s how I did it. It was never about me, it was \u2018you and me\u2019. It was never \u2018us versus them\u2019 because there is no them! So when people go on about Oasis, they miss the point. It wasn\u2019t about snarling and shouting and gobbing in the street. It was inclusive. That\u2019s why so many people turned up to the gigs. And that\u2019s why if I got up tomorrow morning and said: \u2018Let\u2019s do it\u2019\u201d \u2013 he clicks his fingers \u2013 \u201cthe world would change again. Because people never forget the way you made them feel.\u201d</p> <p>Can\u2019t he just reunite the group and bring the country back together, then? He sighs. Despite his opinionated outbursts in the press, he is no more sure than any of us about how to get out of this mess. In fact, he seems genuinely curious about it all. \u201cDo you think there should be a second referendum?\u201d he asks at one point. Probably, I say, which is met with a sharp intake of breath. \u201cOooh, really? That\u2019s just going to cause more division, though, innit?\u201d</p> <p>Noel is also slightly sheepish of the fact he didn\u2019t bother voting. \u201cBecause, I thought, who would be stupid enough to change the way things are? But then I\u2019m living in a massive house in Maida Vale [in north-west London]; why would I want to change the way things are?\u201d</p> <p>Despite all the division, Gallagher remains sanguine about the future. \u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about nuclear bombs,\u201d he says, introducing the subject of apocalypse with alarming cheer. \u201cEver since they\u2019ve been invented, everyone\u2019s been like: \u2018Hang on a minute, are we going for it or what?\u2019 We\u2019re all fed this thing that the guy from North Korea is an insane lunatic. But he\u2019s into basketball! How mad can he be? So we\u2019ll be all right. As for beyond that, well ... fuck the grandkids \u2013 remember, they might be cunts. I\u2019ve said it to my sons many times. They go: \u2018Dad!\u2019 but I tell them they don\u2019t know who they\u2019re gonna marry. She might be an idiot. Or he might be. We\u2019re all modern men.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68a5560c3ca1464323b526b12fa4078a379f6c77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68a5560c3ca1464323b526b12fa4078a379f6c77/312_13_2186_1311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noel Gallagher with Ana\u00efs: \u2018When you\u2019ve got a teenage daughter, you better get with it pretty quick.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noel Gallagher with Ana\u00efs: \u2018When you\u2019ve got a teenage daughter, you better get with it pretty quick.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zak Hussein/Corbis via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does Noel feel modern? Over the years, he has developed something of a grumpy old man persona.</p> <p>\u201cI feel modern in some respects and old-fashioned in others.\u201d</p> <p>How does he feel about gender fluidity?</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks. \u201cI know what gender I am \u2013 Mancunian.\u201d</p> <p>Would he describe himself as a feminist?</p> <p>\u201cOh, absolutely. I didn\u2019t realise until my wife told me I was and I said: \u2018Really? Well, I\u2019ve got to announce that to the world then.\u2019 But definitely, I am. When you\u2019ve got a teenage daughter, you better get with it pretty quick. She comes to my gigs with her teenage pals now and \u2026 it\u2019s something else, believe me. They can talk to you, lucidly, without missing a beat, while texting someone in Ghana, while buying a pair of shoes and listening to music at the same time ... who invented these people?\u201d</p> <p>Gallagher is 52 now, but it seems Ana\u00efs and his boys, Donovan and Sonny, are helping him keep up with the changing cultural landscape. Last month, on tour in the Netherlands, he turned on his hotel TV to watch Stormzy headlining Glastonbury and thought: \u201cOh, so that\u2019s what my two lads are on about. Because they\u2019ll be doing these dances in the kitchen when they\u2019re getting ready for school and I\u2019ll be thinking: \u2018What\u2019s a vossi bop?\u2019 I didn\u2019t realise it was to do with grime.\u201d</p> <p>Stormzy and Oasis are musically worlds apart, but both are products of working-class Britain, even if Stormzy\u2019s union flag stab vest is a different beast to the one painted on Gallagher\u2019s guitar for Oasis\u2019s triumphant shows at Manchester City\u2019s ground in 1996 \u2013 a symbol of Cool Britannia, an icon of a country shaking off years of Tory rule.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s music as English as Pulp, or the Jam or the Kinks,\u201d says Noel of grime in general. \u201cAnd it\u2019s their own language, which is a great thing that something born on council estates out of poverty and street culture has got to the main stage at Glastonbury. Now, if I\u2019m a 52-year-old father of three living in Maida Vale, then he\u2019s talking street jive to me. He\u2019s talking about some guy stabbing him in the back when he was a kid \u2013 I\u2019m not humming along to that! He is good, though, and Skepta is great. I remember seeing him at the Brits \u2013 just him under the spotlight, and thinking: \u2018Wow, it\u2019s fucking powerful, man.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In 2008, Gallagher was criticised for saying Jay-Z was the \u201cwrong\u201d act to headline Glastonbury (\u201cGlastonbury has a tradition of guitar music,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury.\u201d) Does he regret that now?</p> <p>\u201cThat happened because I\u2019d been away in the States for four months and some reporter told me Glastonbury had hip-hop on and hadn\u2019t sold out. So, I was just like: \u2018Oh well, hip-hop\u2019s shit!\u2019 That was it. Of course, your esteemed colleagues at the Guardian seemed to make a lot more of it than it was \u2026\u201d</p> <p>So, it is all our fault then?</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely it\u2019s your fault. Everything is your fault.\u201d</p> <p>There is, however, one person Gallagher thinks will always be wrong to appear at Glastonbury: Jeremy Corbyn, who received a rapturous reception when he delivered a speech there in 2017.</p> <p>\u201cI saw him walk onstage to \u2018Oooh, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019 and thought: \u2018Really? For a start, your name\u2019s Jeremy.\u2019 I don\u2019t trust him. I think that the bare requirement for a politician, particularly a leader, is to be forward-looking. When I watch the news, I just think that, for these people, the big picture is communism, right? And that\u2019s not British.\u201d</p> <p>They are not communists, though.</p> <p>\u201cThey fucking are! You\u2019re not telling me the big picture is not to nationalise everything? Anyway, [Glastonbury] is where you go to get away from that shit. It\u2019s not a political rally. We\u2019re there to get high, and listen to music, and experience things we don\u2019t get to do in our daily lives. Nobody wants to hear that at 2pm. And I\u2019ve even seen Tory politicians there! Walking through in the middle of the night with a pint of white wine and you think: didn\u2019t Margaret Thatcher try to shut this festival down?\u201d He adopts the voice of a port-soaked Tory grandee: \u2018Oh, weren\u2019t the Stones just bladdy marvellous?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And just wait until we get to Liam\u2019s recent solo performance at the festival. \u201cI\u2019d read somewhere that it was a headline set in the making, so I thought: \u2018Fucking hell, better watch this,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so embarrassed for a man in my entire life. He\u2019s pulled off the incredible magic trick of making those Oasis songs sound weedy and thin. And he looked like he was having the worst day of his life, walking around in what looks like a pair of my son\u2019s pyjamas, shouting into a mic about some perceived injustice ... if you can\u2019t sing \u2019em, don\u2019t play \u2019em!\u201d</p> <p>Noel hasn\u2019t seen Liam\u2019s recent documentary, As it Was, although he plans to: \u201cBecause I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s hilarious.\u201d The film is clearly a PR job for Liam\u2019s side of the story, although it is an entertaining watch due to Liam\u2019s onscreen charisma and the fact it shows a different side to the singer \u2013 one who displays self-doubt and admits to being lost after the breakup of Oasis. Noel isn\u2019t the focus, but he is portrayed as aloof and uncaring, the brother who wasn\u2019t there for Liam when he was struggling through his divorce from Nicole Appleton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"766b19d95a1674b92e5914833845ef8c29a874bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/766b19d95a1674b92e5914833845ef8c29a874bd/0_0_3000_2108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noel with Liam and Paul \u2018Bonehead\u2019 Arthurs during an Oasis show in New York in 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noel with Liam and Paul \u2018Bonehead\u2019 Arthurs during an Oasis show in New York in 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Eichner/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Noel bursts out laughing when I bring this up: \u201cI wasn\u2019t there for him? Well, he wasn\u2019t there for his wife either, was he?\u201d</p> <p>Noel\u2019s tone changes dramatically when we talk about Liam. Most of his outrageous comments are said for a laugh, but when it comes to Liam he seems genuinely angry. What did he mean when he accused his brother of intimidating women?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s sent texts to my daughter, or left threatening phone calls on my wife\u2019s answering machine. So when he\u2019s threatening my wife via my teenage daughter, I\u2019m thinking, you know, if you weren\u2019t a rock star, if you were just an uncle who worked in a garage, you\u2019d be getting a visit from the police. But because you\u2019re a rockstar, wahey, you get away with that shit.\u201d</p> <p>Has this gone past the point of you two ever making up?</p> <p>Noel nods: \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got one fatal flaw in my otherwise perfect makeup as a human being, which is I don\u2019t forgive people. Once you start texting my children \u2013 and his <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4919538/Lennon-Gallagher-joins-family-feud-snubbing-Anais.html\" title=\"\">two sons have been going for her, too</a> \u2013 and legitimise my wife being bullied on the internet, where she has to shut down Instagram accounts because of the vile shit being written about her and my daughter, then it ain\u2019t happening.\u201d</p> <p>When did he last see Liam?</p> <p>\u201cAt the Etihad Stadium when City won the league about three years ago. Whenever I see him, he\u2019s actually very polite, and you can see in his eyes that he\u2019s just about to piss his trousers. But then he comes up with these scenarios of when we meet, that only ever take place in his own head.\u201d He puts on his Liam voice again: \u201cAh fuckin\u2019 went over and flicked him in the ear and said: \u2018Eh, fuckin\u2019 \u2019ell, keep it dangerous, you cunt.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Has he heard Liam\u2019s solo material?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t listen to the albums, because I can\u2019t stand his voice. But I hear it on the radio.\u201d</p> <p>What does he think?</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s unsophisticated music. For unsophisticated people. Made by an unsophisticated man. Who\u2019s giving unsophisticated orders to a load of songwriters who think they\u2019re doing the Oasis thing. Which goes back to what I was saying before. You can turn the Marshall amp up to 12 all you want and do a bit of glam, but Oasis words were about including people, everyone in it together. And what I hear from him is just a load of bile ... angry nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>It is time to wrap up, but Gallagher\u2019s still going.</p> <p>\u201cI reckon if I put my two sons in a room \u2013 one\u2019s nine, one\u2019s 11 \u2013 for about 45 minutes, they could probably muster up something better than that new single of his,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Is this all just a crafty way of hyping up a future Oasis reunion?</p> <p>\u201cI wish it was,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt boils down to, on a personal level, fuck him. But also, artistically, why do it again? You know, I was watching the news the other night and he was on there, threatening to break my jaw \u2013 live on the ITV news! Isn\u2019t there a law against that? \u2013 and it\u2019s about an Oasis reunion and he\u2019s like: \u2018Me bags are packed, mate.\u2019 And I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Who are you expecting to call you? Me?\u2019 Nobody wants to be in a band with him apart from a load of indie Championship players \u2013 journeymen, who are in it for all the crisps they can eat.\u201d</p> <p>It seems silly to ask whether Gallagher has anything else he would like to add. Because of course he does. He always does.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, getting up and pointing again at my dictaphone: \u201cDon\u2019t quote me on any of that.\u201d</p> <p><em>This Is the Place is <a href=\"https://nghfb.lnk.to/thisistheplacetg\">out today</a>, taken from the EP of the same name, which will be released on 27 September</em></p> <p><em>Photographed at The Trafalgar St. James.

      "bodyText": "\u2018This,\u201d says Noel Gallagher, nodding towards my dictaphone, \u201cis going to end in trouble. It always does.\u201d Well, let\u2019s hope so! An hour spent in Gallagher\u2019s company is thrillingly unfiltered territory. \u201cInterviews are an occupational hazard,\u201d he says, settling down with a cup of tea. \u201cBut that\u2019s because they\u2019re such weird situations. You\u2019re sat in a room with some guy from Stockholm who you\u2019ve never met and he\u2019s asking you about your mum. It\u2019s fucking preposterous. Because the honest answer to that is: \u2018What\u2019s it got to do with you?\u2019 But the smart answer is always: \u2018I liked her until she gave birth to Liam.\u2019\u201d Oh yes, Liam. There will be plenty more about the youngest Gallagher brother, some of it delivered with real venom now their relationship has sunk to its lowest point. Last month, Noel accused Liam of \u201cintimidating women\u201d after posting screenshots allegedly showing aggressive texts sent to Noel\u2019s teenage daughter, Ana\u00efs. And there will be plenty more on other subjects likely to land him in a spot of bother, too: including the rarely discussed benefits of global warming. \u201cI\u2019m walking around today in a T-shirt, and I\u2019m thinking ...\u201d Gallagher looks up to mock-assess the weather, fully aware he is about to send some Guardian readers berserk, \u201c... it\u2019s not even remotely chilly. Sure, it\u2019ll be bad for my grandkids. But I\u2019ve not met them yet. They might be a load of cunts, d\u2019you know what I mean?\u201d But let\u2019s start with the music, as Noel prepares to release This Is the Place, the second of three EPs planned for this year. It follows Black Star Dancing, his Nile Rodgers-approved disco single. That saw him throw away the shackles of the guitar-led sound that once dominated his career as it moved from incredible peaks \u2013 those glorious first Oasis albums, whose melodic euphoria led to generation-defining gigs at Knebworth in 1996 \u2013 to the troughs, in which the band became plodding and predictable, only to implode with a blazing backstage row before a gig in Paris in 2009. Gallagher admits to being \u201cset in my ways\u201d, but it sounds like he is having fun writing music again. He credits the producer David Holmes \u2013 \u201cone of the biggest musical influences in my life\u201d \u2013 for getting him to ditch his favoured instrument and write in the studio. This Is the Place (the title is taken from Tony Walsh\u2019s poem to Manchester, read aloud in Albert Square after the Manchester arena bombing) takes a space-rock journey through Ian Brown, Primal Scream and the Smiths, and it is almost frustrating it has taken him so long to get here. You wonder how things might have panned out if he had written more adventurous songs like these for Oasis back in the late 90s. \u201cWell, for a start, Liam wouldn\u2019t fucking sing them,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause he famously said to me one night [adopts parody of Liam\u2019s voice]: \u2018I don\u2019t like quirky weird things ...\u2019 and I was like: \u2018Oh OK, well this is going to be fun then.\u2019\u201d Gallagher says there is a new generation of Oasis fans that have come along following the 2016 documentary Supersonic \u2013 and they are not always open to his more experimental leanings, either. \u201cI love winding them up,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d love to be in the room when they heard this [new EP] for the first time.\u201d He has a knack for winding people up, and not just with his music. Lately, he has been enraging remainers \u2013 of which he is one \u2013 by saying: \u201cThere\u2019s only one fucking thing worse than a fool who voted for Brexit, and that\u2019s the rise of the cunts trying to get the vote overturned.\u201d \u201cAnd people started calling me a Nazi!\u201d he says. \u201cI thought: \u2018Really? A member of the Third Reich?\u2019 Look, I think it\u2019s ridiculous that we\u2019re leaving. None of us were even qualified to vote. You ask a guy above a chippy in Bradford if we should leave Europe. \u2018Yeah!\u2019 But I still think if there\u2019s a second referendum, as a nation, we\u2019ll never recover. We have to come out because, no matter how ill-informed people were, you\u2019re saying to them their vote doesn\u2019t count. And its symptomatic of shutting people\u2019s opinions down.\u201d Oasis were renowned for drunken debauchery, bust-ups and brawls, but what is often forgotten is the spirit of togetherness they fostered. While their Britpop rivals Blur examined the country\u2019s condition with lofty detachment, Oasis were all about the collective experience. Noel says he has the Hacienda and rave culture to thank for it. \u201cAcid house changed my life,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look at the words to those songs ... it\u2019s all about unity, \u2018us\u2019, the whole communal thing. So when I started writing songs, instinctively, that\u2019s how I did it. It was never about me, it was \u2018you and me\u2019. It was never \u2018us versus them\u2019 because there is no them! So when people go on about Oasis, they miss the point. It wasn\u2019t about snarling and shouting and gobbing in the street. It was inclusive. That\u2019s why so many people turned up to the gigs. And that\u2019s why if I got up tomorrow morning and said: \u2018Let\u2019s do it\u2019\u201d \u2013 he clicks his fingers \u2013 \u201cthe world would change again. Because people never forget the way you made them feel.\u201d Can\u2019t he just reunite the group and bring the country back together, then? He sighs. Despite his opinionated outbursts in the press, he is no more sure than any of us about how to get out of this mess. In fact, he seems genuinely curious about it all. \u201cDo you think there should be a second referendum?\u201d he asks at one point. Probably, I say, which is met with a sharp intake of breath. \u201cOooh, really? That\u2019s just going to cause more division, though, innit?\u201d Noel is also slightly sheepish of the fact he didn\u2019t bother voting. \u201cBecause, I thought, who would be stupid enough to change the way things are? But then I\u2019m living in a massive house in Maida Vale [in north-west London]; why would I want to change the way things are?\u201d Despite all the division, Gallagher remains sanguine about the future. \u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about nuclear bombs,\u201d he says, introducing the subject of apocalypse with alarming cheer. \u201cEver since they\u2019ve been invented, everyone\u2019s been like: \u2018Hang on a minute, are we going for it or what?\u2019 We\u2019re all fed this thing that the guy from North Korea is an insane lunatic. But he\u2019s into basketball! How mad can he be? So we\u2019ll be all right. As for beyond that, well ... fuck the grandkids \u2013 remember, they might be cunts. I\u2019ve said it to my sons many times. They go: \u2018Dad!\u2019 but I tell them they don\u2019t know who they\u2019re gonna marry. She might be an idiot. Or he might be. We\u2019re all modern men.\u201d Does Noel feel modern? Over the years, he has developed something of a grumpy old man persona. \u201cI feel modern in some respects and old-fashioned in others.\u201d How does he feel about gender fluidity? \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks. \u201cI know what gender I am \u2013 Mancunian.\u201d Would he describe himself as a feminist? \u201cOh, absolutely. I didn\u2019t realise until my wife told me I was and I said: \u2018Really? Well, I\u2019ve got to announce that to the world then.\u2019 But definitely, I am. When you\u2019ve got a teenage daughter, you better get with it pretty quick. She comes to my gigs with her teenage pals now and \u2026 it\u2019s something else, believe me. They can talk to you, lucidly, without missing a beat, while texting someone in Ghana, while buying a pair of shoes and listening to music at the same time ... who invented these people?\u201d Gallagher is 52 now, but it seems Ana\u00efs and his boys, Donovan and Sonny, are helping him keep up with the changing cultural landscape. Last month, on tour in the Netherlands, he turned on his hotel TV to watch Stormzy headlining Glastonbury and thought: \u201cOh, so that\u2019s what my two lads are on about. Because they\u2019ll be doing these dances in the kitchen when they\u2019re getting ready for school and I\u2019ll be thinking: \u2018What\u2019s a vossi bop?\u2019 I didn\u2019t realise it was to do with grime.\u201d Stormzy and Oasis are musically worlds apart, but both are products of working-class Britain, even if Stormzy\u2019s union flag stab vest is a different beast to the one painted on Gallagher\u2019s guitar for Oasis\u2019s triumphant shows at Manchester City\u2019s ground in 1996 \u2013 a symbol of Cool Britannia, an icon of a country shaking off years of Tory rule. \u201cIt\u2019s music as English as Pulp, or the Jam or the Kinks,\u201d says Noel of grime in general. \u201cAnd it\u2019s their own language, which is a great thing that something born on council estates out of poverty and street culture has got to the main stage at Glastonbury. Now, if I\u2019m a 52-year-old father of three living in Maida Vale, then he\u2019s talking street jive to me. He\u2019s talking about some guy stabbing him in the back when he was a kid \u2013 I\u2019m not humming along to that! He is good, though, and Skepta is great. I remember seeing him at the Brits \u2013 just him under the spotlight, and thinking: \u2018Wow, it\u2019s fucking powerful, man.\u2019\u201d In 2008, Gallagher was criticised for saying Jay-Z was the \u201cwrong\u201d act to headline Glastonbury (\u201cGlastonbury has a tradition of guitar music,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury.\u201d) Does he regret that now? \u201cThat happened because I\u2019d been away in the States for four months and some reporter told me Glastonbury had hip-hop on and hadn\u2019t sold out. So, I was just like: \u2018Oh well, hip-hop\u2019s shit!\u2019 That was it. Of course, your esteemed colleagues at the Guardian seemed to make a lot more of it than it was \u2026\u201d So, it is all our fault then? \u201cAbsolutely it\u2019s your fault. Everything is your fault.\u201d There is, however, one person Gallagher thinks will always be wrong to appear at Glastonbury: Jeremy Corbyn, who received a rapturous reception when he delivered a speech there in 2017. \u201cI saw him walk onstage to \u2018Oooh, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019 and thought: \u2018Really? For a start, your name\u2019s Jeremy.\u2019 I don\u2019t trust him. I think that the bare requirement for a politician, particularly a leader, is to be forward-looking. When I watch the news, I just think that, for these people, the big picture is communism, right? And that\u2019s not British.\u201d They are not communists, though. \u201cThey fucking are! You\u2019re not telling me the big picture is not to nationalise everything? Anyway, [Glastonbury] is where you go to get away from that shit. It\u2019s not a political rally. We\u2019re there to get high, and listen to music, and experience things we don\u2019t get to do in our daily lives. Nobody wants to hear that at 2pm. And I\u2019ve even seen Tory politicians there! Walking through in the middle of the night with a pint of white wine and you think: didn\u2019t Margaret Thatcher try to shut this festival down?\u201d He adopts the voice of a port-soaked Tory grandee: \u2018Oh, weren\u2019t the Stones just bladdy marvellous?\u2019\u201d And just wait until we get to Liam\u2019s recent solo performance at the festival. \u201cI\u2019d read somewhere that it was a headline set in the making, so I thought: \u2018Fucking hell, better watch this,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so embarrassed for a man in my entire life. He\u2019s pulled off the incredible magic trick of making those Oasis songs sound weedy and thin. And he looked like he was having the worst day of his life, walking around in what looks like a pair of my son\u2019s pyjamas, shouting into a mic about some perceived injustice ... if you can\u2019t sing \u2019em, don\u2019t play \u2019em!\u201d Noel hasn\u2019t seen Liam\u2019s recent documentary, As it Was, although he plans to: \u201cBecause I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s hilarious.\u201d The film is clearly a PR job for Liam\u2019s side of the story, although it is an entertaining watch due to Liam\u2019s onscreen charisma and the fact it shows a different side to the singer \u2013 one who displays self-doubt and admits to being lost after the breakup of Oasis. Noel isn\u2019t the focus, but he is portrayed as aloof and uncaring, the brother who wasn\u2019t there for Liam when he was struggling through his divorce from Nicole Appleton. Noel bursts out laughing when I bring this up: \u201cI wasn\u2019t there for him? Well, he wasn\u2019t there for his wife either, was he?\u201d Noel\u2019s tone changes dramatically when we talk about Liam. Most of his outrageous comments are said for a laugh, but when it comes to Liam he seems genuinely angry. What did he mean when he accused his brother of intimidating women? \u201cThat\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s sent texts to my daughter, or left threatening phone calls on my wife\u2019s answering machine. So when he\u2019s threatening my wife via my teenage daughter, I\u2019m thinking, you know, if you weren\u2019t a rock star, if you were just an uncle who worked in a garage, you\u2019d be getting a visit from the police. But because you\u2019re a rockstar, wahey, you get away with that shit.\u201d Has this gone past the point of you two ever making up? Noel nods: \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got one fatal flaw in my otherwise perfect makeup as a human being, which is I don\u2019t forgive people. Once you start texting my children \u2013 and his two sons have been going for her, too \u2013 and legitimise my wife being bullied on the internet, where she has to shut down Instagram accounts because of the vile shit being written about her and my daughter, then it ain\u2019t happening.\u201d When did he last see Liam? \u201cAt the Etihad Stadium when City won the league about three years ago. Whenever I see him, he\u2019s actually very polite, and you can see in his eyes that he\u2019s just about to piss his trousers. But then he comes up with these scenarios of when we meet, that only ever take place in his own head.\u201d He puts on his Liam voice again: \u201cAh fuckin\u2019 went over and flicked him in the ear and said: \u2018Eh, fuckin\u2019 \u2019ell, keep it dangerous, you cunt.\u2019\u201d Has he heard Liam\u2019s solo material? \u201cI don\u2019t listen to the albums, because I can\u2019t stand his voice. But I hear it on the radio.\u201d What does he think? \u201cI think it\u2019s unsophisticated music. For unsophisticated people. Made by an unsophisticated man. Who\u2019s giving unsophisticated orders to a load of songwriters who think they\u2019re doing the Oasis thing. Which goes back to what I was saying before. You can turn the Marshall amp up to 12 all you want and do a bit of glam, but Oasis words were about including people, everyone in it together. And what I hear from him is just a load of bile ... angry nonsense.\u201d It is time to wrap up, but Gallagher\u2019s still going. \u201cI reckon if I put my two sons in a room \u2013 one\u2019s nine, one\u2019s 11 \u2013 for about 45 minutes, they could probably muster up something better than that new single of his,\u201d he says. Is this all just a crafty way of hyping up a future Oasis reunion? \u201cI wish it was,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt boils down to, on a personal level, fuck him. But also, artistically, why do it again? You know, I was watching the news the other night and he was on there, threatening to break my jaw \u2013 live on the ITV news! Isn\u2019t there a law against that? \u2013 and it\u2019s about an Oasis reunion and he\u2019s like: \u2018Me bags are packed, mate.\u2019 And I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Who are you expecting to call you? Me?\u2019 Nobody wants to be in a band with him apart from a load of indie Championship players \u2013 journeymen, who are in it for all the crisps they can eat.\u201d It seems silly to ask whether Gallagher has anything else he would like to add. Because of course he does. He always does. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, getting up and pointing again at my dictaphone: \u201cDon\u2019t quote me on any of that.\u201d This Is the Place is out today, taken from the EP of the same name, which will be released on 27 September Photographed at The Trafalgar St. James.

      "bodyText": "My 12-year-old son Harrison had his 23rd surgical procedure last week, a biopsy that revealed the kidney he received from me just under four years ago is in rejection. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u201d is a phrase that is heard quite a lot around our household. His various conditions that impact his life in a range of ways have no specific hereditary or external cause \u2013 his disadvantage is an unfair random occurrence. There\u2019s also a lot that\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d in our favour because we\u2019re Australians. Without our excellent medical system and practitioners Harrison wouldn\u2019t have survived beyond birth. If my wife and I weren\u2019t born into the privilege we possess he wouldn\u2019t have had many of the experiences that have made his 12 years memorable, enjoyable and fulfilling for him, our family and friends. Without universal healthcare much of that privilege would\u2019ve been swiftly eroded by the astronomic costs of regular hospitalisation, surgery and medication that have been largely covered by Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. This is the standard that deep in Australia\u2019s psyche we believe to be fair for our citizens. When disadvantage is caused by a medical condition we practice a universal principle of fairness \u2013 that is, to the utmost extent of all available medical equipment and expertise we will remove the barriers to a person\u2019s ability to contribute and thrive, regardless of their social status or wealth, funded by the public purse. Yet when it comes to other causes of disadvantage experienced by Australians we practice an opposing principle \u2013 we routinely add further barriers to be overcome in the pursuit of a flourishing life. To that which a citizen has experienced as unfairness we will add our disdain, our ignorance and amplify that unfairness through legislation and regulation. For millions of working Australians without jobs we refuse to increase an already inadequate income support payment for 25 years, pretending that the punishment of choosing between heating and eating and being unable to afford to buy new clothes or renew your wifi contract is going to lead to employment and engaging in public ridicule and private prejudice when it does not.

      "bodyText": "A shattering weekend in which two mass shootings left at least 30 people dead and injured dozens put Donald Trump at the center of a storm of outrage over racism and the failure on gun control in America. Even as the president said \u201chate has no place in our country\u201d and blamed the shootings on mental illness, investigators in El Paso confirmed that a massacre at a Walmart superstore on Saturday that left at least 21 people dead in the Texas border city had been preceded by the suspected gunman publishing an anti-immigration screed via the darker recesses of the internet. And in a mass shooting in the early hours of Sunday, just 13 hours later, a gunman in Dayton, Ohio, was wearing body armor and carrying 100-bullet magazines to arm his high-powered rifle, with law enforcement authorities warning he could have killed many dozens of people if he had not been shot by police within 30 seconds of opening fire. The shootings were carried out just a week after a 19-year-old, also armed with a high-caliber rifle, opened fire at a popular annual food festival in Gilroy, northern California, killing three and wounding others. Led by those running for president, senior Democrats, including the local former congressman of El Paso, Beto O\u2019Rourke, condemned the president as a nakedly white nationalist and racist leader. They pointed at Trump\u2019s escalating attacks on migrants at the border and on members of Congress of color, including inflammatory comments and posturing that sparked a crowd at a rally last month to chant \u201csend her back\u201d about the Muslim congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

Outside the Del Sol medical center in El Paso on Sunday, mourners had erected signs saying: \u201cNo hate can ruin our great city\u201d and \u201cOur city is pure love.\u201d A 21-year-old, Daisy Fuentes, told the Guardian that her grandparents went to the Walmart to shop for curtains, and that both of them were shot during the massacre. Her 66-year-old grandmother, Nicolasa Velasquez, called the family right after. \u201cWe were scared. We were crying. We didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Fuentes. \u201cMy mom was trying to tell her to stay calm and breathe.

It\u2019s time for this to change,\u201d said Little in a statement. \u201cSafe abortion should be treated and regulated as a health issue; a woman has the right to choose what happens to her body.\u201d Under the draft legislation, which will have its first reading on Thursday, no statutory test would be required for a women wanting to terminate a pregnancy up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. Women would be able to self-refer to abortion providers, bypassing the need for a doctor\u2019s visit, and would be advised of counselling and support services, though counselling would not be mandatory. Women wanting to terminate a pregnancy that is more than 20 weeks would need the sign-off of a health practitioner, who would need to \u201creasonably believe the abortion is appropriate with regard to the pregnant woman\u2019s physical and mental health, and well-being\u201d. Safe areas would also be set up around abortion specific services as required \u201con a case-by-case basis.\u201d Terry Bellamak, director of ALRANZ Abortion Rights Aotearoa said New Zealand women have waited decades for the overhaul and though the bill was \u201ca huge step forward, and quite an achievement\u201d, the details were a bit of a \u201cmixed bag\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not as good as it could have been, but it\u2019s so much better than the status quo \u2026 it\u2019s a good start,\u201d Bellamak said. \u201cBut why the 20 week limit? There are scans that happen around 20 weeks, and this gives people little time to consider those results. \u201cThe safe areas seem to be reactive rather than proactive, because the regulations are made on a case-by-case basis. Does this mean providers and patients must suffer actual harassment, intimidation, or injury before they can apply to the minister for a safe area? That might put health practitioners off providing abortion care.\u201d The bill will be treated as a conscience issue, with MPs able to cast their votes independent of their political party\u2019s position.",

      "bodyText": "Jordan and Andre Anchondo were shot while trying to protect their two-month-old son, when a gunman opened fire in a crowded El Paso shopping area. The baby was injured, and almost certainly had his life saved by his parents\u2019 heroic efforts. \u201cHer husband was in front of the gunman to protect Jordan, and Jordan was protecting her baby,\u201d Monique Terry, Jordan Anchondo\u2019s 21-year-old cousin, told the Guardian. \u201cThat explains who she was as a person \u2013 she gave everything for her baby\u201d, Terry said about her cousin. Jordan and Andre Anchonda were among the 22 people killed in Saturday\u2019s rampage. Federal prosecutors are treating the shooting at the Texas city on the Mexican border as an act of domestic terrorism and a possible hate crime. The 21-year-old gunman was taken into custody on Saturday. Leta Jamrowski learned on Saturday afternoon that her sister, Jordan, had been fatally shot by the gunman at the Texas border city, while Jordan and her baby were shopping for back-to-school supplies earlier in the day. \u201cFrom the baby\u2019s injuries, they said that more than likely my sister was trying to shield him,\u201d Jamrowski told the Associated Press. \u201cSo when she got shot she was holding him and she fell on him, so that\u2019s why he broke some of his bones. So he pretty much lived because she gave her life.\u201d Terry told the Guardian that the family eventually learned later on Sunday that Andre didn\u2019t survive either, and that he had died at Walmart, and was still inside the store. Jordan and Andre were the parents of three children, who are five years old, two years old and two months old. The couple had dropped off their five-year-old daughter at cheerleading camp nearby just before going to Walmart to buy school supplies, Terry said. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough.

And, in many ways, we have been,\u201d said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a journalism professor in Mexico City. \u201cWith this new policy toward [migrating] Central Americans, the tables have turned and now Mexicans are the Americans to Central Americans.\u201d The El Paso shootout prompted rare terse words on the US situation from Mexico\u2019s foreign policy officials. \u201cThe intentionality of the attack against the Mexicans and the Latino community in El Paso is frightening. NO to hate speech. NO to xenophobic discourse,\u201d tweeted Martha B\u00e1rcena, Mexico\u2019s ambassador in Washington. The administration of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, commonly called \u201cAmlo\u201d, has pushed for action on the flow of US guns into Mexico, which inevitably end up in the hands of cartel thugs. But Amlo has preferred not provoke Trump, even as Trump has badmouthed Mexico ahead of his re-election campaign and threatened Mexico with tariffs if migration through Mexico was not stopped. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to interfere in the affairs of other countries. We\u2019re going to continue sticking to the principles of non-intervention,\u201d Amlo told an audience on Sunday. \u201cHugs, not bullets. That\u2019s our posture,\u201d he added, repeating a campaign slogan from his successful 2018 presidential campaign.",

      "bodyText": "In a bruising round of Super Netball which featured a busted nose and perceptible on-court trash talking, it was two goal defenders who stood out \u2013 for vastly different reasons. The Sunshine Coast Lightning\u2019s Karla Pretorius shone in a remarkable match-winning performance against injury-hit ladder leaders the NSW Swifts, while young Firebird Kim Jenner will be under the microscope for less auspicious reasons \u2013 namely a season-high 32 penalties in her side\u2019s 63-57 loss to the Giants. The contrast between Pretorius, the player of the tournament at last month\u2019s World Cup, and 21-year-old Jenner, who had 19 contacts and 13 obstructions, could not have been more stark. Pretorius fired with a round-high six intercepts and five deflections to earn the MVP award, but Jenner let herself down with ill-discipline in a spiteful match, which also saw her teammate Gretel Tippett leave the court five minutes into the first quarter after catching an elbow from Kristiana Manu\u2019a.

She also had 19 feeds and 22 centre pass receives, the most of any Firebird on both counts. But it was Jenner\u2019s at-times reckless play \u2013 often matched by her opposite number, Jo Harten, who was named MVP despite drawing whistle herself \u2013 that, along with the umpiring which allowed it, provided the biggest talking points. As well as a dizzying number of player-on-player penalties, the Queensland GD also had two breaks, three general play turnovers and one \u201cbad hand\u201d stat. Jenner\u2019s usual defensive partner, Tara Hinchliffe, was ruled out just a few hours before the match with an ankle injury, meaning third-choice defender Laura Clemesha went to goal keeper. It also meant when things turned ugly, Firebirds coach Roselee Jencke had no option to bench Jenner, who simply did not respond to repeated instructions to \u201cstay in play\u201d. The lack of control was not confined to Jenner though, with players on both sides guilty of ugly and late challenges \u2013 and of mouthing off, something which is reasonably uncommon in Super Netball. The fact more cautions were not given by officials \u2013 which would have brought the match swiftly under control \u2013 is something the game\u2019s bosses surely have to look into. In comparison to the bash and crash in Canberra, Pretorius was penalised just eight times for contact against the Swifts and did not once obstruct, a rare feat for a player whose job it is to defend. She wore down Sophie Garbin, who replaced the injured Helen Housby at goal attack for the Swifts, restricting her to just 12 goals from 15 attempts. Behind by four goals at three-quarter time, the only way Lightning could prevail was to win ball, and that is exactly what Pretorius did in partnership with her Proteas teammate, Phumza Maweni. Combined, Pretorius and Maweni had one intercept and five deflections in the last and turned the game. Pundits are fast running out of superlatives for Pretorius, one of the first South Africans to play professionally, but \u201cbest goal defence in the world right now\u201d is a moniker few would argue with, with three home-and-away rounds to play. The loss leaves the once-mighty Firebirds winless after 11 rounds and holding up the ladder, while pre-season favourites Collingwood face a mountain to climb if they want to figure in finals following another physical encounter over the weekend. The Pies, sitting just outside the top four and desperate to keep their finals hopes alive, took on the Thunderbirds, but could only manage a draw. Four points behind the fourth-placed Giants, the Pies now face the Fever, Swifts and Vixens in the last three rounds. The Melbourne Vixens got the job done against the West Coast Fever on Saturday afternoon, winning 64-52 thanks to a spectacular defensive effort from MVP Emily Mannix and Jo Weston on Caribbean colossus Jhaniele Fowler. Simone McKinnis\u2019 well-drilled charges, sitting third, take on the Swifts in Sydney next Saturday and the other top two sides, Lightning and Giants, also face off, in clashes that will be instructive for the business end of the season. As the season builds towards the finals, it is clear the netball maxim that defence wins championships may well prove, once again, to be true.",

      "bodyText": "The sheriff of El Paso did not mince his words when he spoke of Saturday\u2019s mass shooting that left 21 dead. \u201cThis Anglo man came here to kill Hispanics.\u201d In a Facebook post, the sheriff, Richard Wiles, called the 21-year-old suspect a \u201cracist\u201d who came to the Texas border city to kill people because of \u201cthe color of their skin\u201d. While US politicians have engaged in predictable policy debates in the wake of two deadly massacres this weekend, residents of El Paso said they were not afraid to call the shooting a white supremacist hate crime and terrorist attack against Latinos. \u201cWe see this as an act of racism toward all Hispanics,\u201d 21-year-old Daisy Fuentes told the Guardian on Sunday. She and her family were gathered at a local hospital where both her grandparents were taken after they were shot in the Saturday morning Walmart attack that left at least 21 dead and two dozen more injured. \u201cIt was full of Hispanics in that Walmart. It\u2019s just super sad.\u201d Residents across El Paso were reeling from the horrific violence, shaken by the news that the white suspect, Patrick Crusius, allegedly published an anti-immigrant, racist \u201cmanifesto\u201d before opening fire in a crowded store. The document reportedly warned of the \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas\u201d, and Crusius is facing murder charges and a federal hate crime investigation. The western Texas city has been the subject of intense national attention in recent years, as the Trump administration made it a target of attacks on migrants and refugees. Trump\u2019s former attorney general once said El Paso was \u201cground zero\u201d and the \u201cfrontlines\u201d for border conflicts. The president also famously launched his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and drug dealers, and has continued to label Latino migration an \u201cinvasion\u201d. In reality, El Paso, which has about 680,000 people and an 80% Latino population, has consistently ranked as one of the safest cities in the US, directly contradicting Trump\u2019s false narratives linking immigration and crime. \u201cA lot of the rhetoric that this president has made is found in that manifesto,\u201d said the Texas representative C\u00e9sar Blanco, whose El Paso district office is located blocks away from where the shooting took place. \u201cThese words like \u2018invasion\u2019 are harmful to our community and come from the president, who has alluded to my community as \u2018murderers and rapists bringing in crimes and drugs\u2019. When our national leaders are speaking in such a way, it sends a message to a lot of these white supremacists that it\u2019s OK to allow hate to continue and spread.\u201d The Walmart shooting killed almost as many people as the total number of homicides in 2018 in El Paso. \u201cI pray this doesn\u2019t bring a stigma on our city,\u201d said Phoenix Vasquez, a 42-year-old lifelong El Paso resident who came to one of the hospitals on Sunday to pray with victims\u2019 families. \u201cWe are a very friendly city, a very united city.\u201d More than 23,000 people cross the border from its Mexican twin city, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, each day to go to work. \u201cWe don\u2019t want El Paso to be known for this,\u201d Vasquez said, adding that people should not be afraid to visit. \u201cThis is not our city.\u201d Officials and locals were quick to remind people that the suspect was not associated with El Paso, but had traveled from more than 600 miles away, from a Dallas suburb. \u201cThe perpetrator of this crime was not from here,\u201d said David Stout, the El Paso county commissioner. \u201cThis has been one of the safest cities in the United States for years, and we are going to continue to be safe \u2026 But we always find ourselves in the middle of this negative rhetoric that is being perpetrated by our president. They are always trying to demonize the border. It\u2019s something that we have constantly had to battle.\u201d It seemed clear, he said, that this attack was \u201cvery calculated and purposefully done to attack our community\u201d. David Rios, a 42-year-old who works in IT at a hospital, and has lived in El Paso his whole life, said he was trying to shield his seven-year-old daughter from the news. \u201cWe are trying to be normal,\u201d he said, as he and his daughter drew hearts in the sand at a playground not far from the site of the shooting. \u201cBut people are going to be a little more vigilant \u2026 You hope these types of things never happen, but unfortunately it did. We are just going to have to learn to acclimate back to normal.\u201d Sam Thomas, a local pastor who was providing support to families, said he was glad to see police treating the crime as terrorism, and was hoping the tragedy could inspire change. \u201cThe racism, the hate, the vitriol can hopefully subside \u2013 at least for a moment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these things always seem to go back to the way they were.\u201d \u201cIn the last several months, the borderlands have shown the world that generosity, compassion and human dignity are more powerful than the forces of division,\u201d said Bishop Mark Seitz, the Roman Catholic archbishop of El Paso, in a statement in the wake of the shooting. \u201cThe great sickness of our time is that we have forgotten how to be compassionate, generous and humane,\u201d he added. The bishop, who has spoken out to defend migrants crossing the border into the US from Central America via Mexico, previously urged Americans not to categorize migrants as the latest convenient group of people \u201cto look down upon and to fear\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIn general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto.\u201d That\u2019s how the man accused of shooting at least 20 people in a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, began the document he posted on 8chan. The atrocity comes in the wake of a murderous attack on the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California on 27 April. The man detained for that crime also posted a manifesto to 8chan and also described the Christchurch shooter as a catalyst, saying: \u201c\u2018He showed me that it could be done.\u201d What might induce people to imitate the Christchurch massacre, an atrocity in which a self-identified fascist allegedly murdered 51 innocents in cold blood? To answer that question, we must grasp the historical evolution of fascism in the 21st century. The ongoing War on Terror normalised an anti-Muslim rhetoric that replicated, almost exactly, all the traditional tropes of antisemitism. Yet, in the English-speaking world, the main beneficiaries of the new racism were not fascists but rightwing populists. A new generation of politicians, parties and media personalities openly embraced xenophobia and Islamophobia but, for the most part, they eschewed the culture of violence associated with genuine fascists. Racist populists denounced the \u201celite\u201d for facilitating immigration. They didn\u2019t, however, call for that elite to be executed, nor did they build paramilitary forces to physically attack those they deemed \u201ctraitors\u201d. Fascism grew online rather than in the real world, with neo-Nazis and white supremacists finding an audience on sites like 4chan (and later 8chan). The distinctive online troll culture allowed rants about Hitler, gas chambers and death squads to circulate widely disguised as edgy \u201chumour\u201d. The election of Donald Trump, a man associated with racist populism, encouraged some fascists to move from online propaganda to real-world activism. In the United States, their efforts culminated in the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville in 2017, the event at which the anti-racist activist Heather Heyer was murdered. After Charlottesville, however, most of the fascist organisations fell apart: in part because of scrutiny from authorities and the media, but mostly because of the consistent counter-protests by anti-fascists. The Christchurch perpetrator planned his attack as a response to that defeat, and the similar decline of the Australian fascist grouplets he admired. That\u2019s crucial to understanding both his massacre and the killings inspired by it. He embraced terrorism precisely because terror attacks could be launched by isolated individuals, people without organisational backing or any real political support. Anti-fascists might prevent white supremacists from holding marches or meetings. But it was much harder to stop an unknown terrorist from opening fire in a public place. The Christchurch killer made clear in his manifesto that his decision to murder Muslims was entirely tactical. He regarded all non-whites as \u201cinvaders\u201d and chose Muslims simply because Islamophobia made them unpopular. In a sense, violence was an end in itself, a way to distinguish himself from racist populists who talked but didn\u2019t act. It was on that basis that an Islamophobic attack could inspire the Poway shooter to shoot up a synagogue and the El Paso killer to target Hispanics, as one form of racism blended into another. \u201cMy whole life I have been preparing for a future that currently doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d complains the alleged perpetrator of the Walmart massacre. The bleakness of his manifesto, a lament about the supposed consequences of immigration and automation, echoed the grim vision presented by the Christchurch shooter, who advocated a doctrine that he called \u201caccelerationism\u201d. Precisely because he didn\u2019t believe the organised fascist right could grow in the short term, the perpetrator thought society doomed \u2013 and saw mass murder as a way of speeding up a destruction that was already coming. His manifesto was addressed not to the public as a whole but to readers of fascist-inflected sites like 8chan. That was why he studded his manifesto with memes \u2013 even including some on the livestream of the actual murders, so that online fascists would feel a sense of ownership for the killing. In that way he hoped to make his actions a source of fascination for damaged people whose obsession with race theory cloaked a prevailing sense of their own inadequacy and failure. In America in particular, gun massacres have become a cultural phenomenon by which men vent all kinds of frustrations \u2013 the subsequent shooting in Ohio marked the 252nd such killing in the US in 2019 alone. The Christchurch killer sought to politicise the familiar script associated with such events. To the young men on 8chan, he presented gun massacre both as a political tactic and as a form of personal redemption \u2013 a way for socially awkward misfits to transform themselves into fascist supermen. As many commentators noted, the video of the Christchurch massacre looked like a computer game. The message for other online fascists who watched the awful footage was that, by opening fire on perceived enemies, they too could become the main player and not an non-player character \u2013 even if only for a moment. That perception was accentuated by the culture on 8chan, where self-identified Nazis discussed each new gun massacre like connoisseurs, debating the weapons tactics used and tallying up \u201cscores\u201d of victims. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say he is \u2018our guy\u2019,\u201d said one poster in the hours after the El Paso killings. \u201cThings ARE accelerating,\u201d wrote another, \u201cand attack are happening with increasing frequency. Hail our martyrs! Hail our heroes!\u201d We can only prevent future massacres if we understand the threat we face. To that end, we need an open discussion \u2013 without euphemisms and evasions \u2013 about what fascism is and how it works. We need to distinguish genuine fascism, an ideology of violence centred on the extermination of opponents, from the rightwing populism of Trump and Fox News and Pauline Hanson. But we also need to recognise that the normalisation of racism \u2013 by populists and others \u2013 makes the work of fascists easier. When, for instance, Andrew Bolt says that \u201cimmigration is becoming colonisation\u201d, his discussion of the proportion of Muslims in Lakemba and the number of Jews in North Caulfield doesn\u2019t culminate in a call for immigrants to be killed. Bolt is not a fascist, but his work does help popularise the \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d theory associated with all the recent fascist terrorists, as well as providing a context in which violence against supposed \u201ccolonisers\u201d can seem necessary. With Donald Trump demonising American anti-fascists, it\u2019s also important to recognise the importance of the protests that, after 2017, did so much to drive fascists off the streets. We need more of that sentiment, not less \u2013 and we need to take it online, so as to confront the radicalisation taking place on the internet. Most of all, we need, as a matter of urgency, to develop a positive political vision for the future. In their manifestoes, both the Christchurch killer and the man arrested in El Paso wrote about climate change, blaming immigrants for environmental destruction. At one level, the doctrine that the Christchurch perpetrator called \u201cecofascism\u201d is obviously ridiculous. Global warming is, as the name suggests, a planetary problem: it can\u2019t be solved by borders. But the widespread despair about a seemingly unstoppable environmental catastrophe allows fascist accelerationism to get a hearing. If the world\u2019s fated to burn, the notion of fanning the flames \u2013 or, indeed, becoming the fire yourself \u2013 will always find adherents. That\u2019s why, to counter fascist violence, we need to offer a better future, not simply more of the status quo. Confronted with the politics of hate, it\u2019s all the more necessary to set a course on hope.

He dances freely and without cringe, even as he recreates the choreography from his turn as Gaston in Beauty and the Beast in 1996 at Melbourne\u2019s Princess Theatre. He tells us his brother calling him a sissy prevented him from taking dance lessons; he dances joyously now, secure in himself and his interests. The message is clear: follow your dreams, no matter what others might say.</p> <p>He shows himself as a loving husband and father \u2013 he descends into the audience to waltz with Deborra-Lee Furness, his wife of 23 years \u2013 but he immediately jokes about making all the other husbands look bad. He\u2019s your mate. He plays piano onstage and immediately makes a self-deprecating joke about thinking he\u2019s somehow qualified to play a piano at an arena show (with specific apologies to Billy Joel).</p> <p>He brings out two children\u2019s choirs to sing You Will Be Found from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/02/dear-evan-hansen-review-musical-emotional-critique-internet\">Dear Evan Hansen</a>, the reigning hit musical for sensitive teens, written by The Greatest Showman\u2019s songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.

A woman is pulled from the audience to dance with him; she clings in delight. Jackman shakes his hips and moves like Allen, a little queerness in every step. Later, he mugs in Wolverine poses, joking that the X-Men fans in the audience must have been suffering all night. He knows he pushes the boundaries of acceptable bloke behaviour; he encourages you to let him.</p> <p>His audience is, typically, entranced. They cheer when the band plays the 20th Century Fox theme as Jackman describes his love for movie musicals. They even cheer at his take on Valjean\u2019s Soliloquy and One Day More from Les Mis\u00e9rables. Jackman\u2019s voice, which has always been more about charm and power than technique, serves him well in this enormous space. But when his special guest, The Greatest Showman\u2019s Keala Settle, emerges to sing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2018/oct/01/how-this-is-me-became-the-new-let-it-go-the-ultimate-anthem-for-the-identity-politics-era\">generic-outsider anthem This is Me</a>, her stunning voice brings people around me to tears. Jackman made space for her to shine.</p> <p>Later in the second act, he gives the stage over to Walmatjarri and Bunuba blues singer Olive Knight who, with son Clifton Bieundurry and didgeridoo players Paul Boon and Nathan Mundraby, performs a number in Walmatjarri. After Jackman joins them for a rendition of Israel Kamakawiwo\u2019ole\u2019s Somewhere Over the Rainbow, he speaks movingly about living in \u201can increasingly divided world\u201d and wanting to spread \u201cthe idea of reconciliation through art, through music, through culture\u201d. He hands Knight the microphone to translate her words into English, so we do not miss them: \u201cThe land is crying for its people. The people are crying for the land. Do not be silent. Speak up for her.\u201d</p> <p>The Man. The Music. The Show is a strange mix of earnest performance, a variety show for the heartfelt and easy-pushed buttons of popular entertainment. But popular entertainment is popular for a reason and it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the spectacle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/23/hamilton-fantasy-cast-who-should-star-in-the-australian-production\">Hamilton fantasy cast: who should star in the Australian production?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I told my ride-share driver why I was going to the Qudos Bank Arena, he brightened.

He even promises us to tell us when he\u2019s two songs from the end, just in case we\u2019re the kind of people who like to leave early to beat the traffic. It\u2019s easy to understand Jackman\u2019s international appeal, with massive movies like The Greatest Showman and The X-Men franchise under his belt. But Australia seems to love him so fervently, this man out of time, singing Sinatra and tap-dancing to AC/DC. Jackman is comfortable as himself. He dances freely and without cringe, even as he recreates the choreography from his turn as Gaston in Beauty and the Beast in 1996 at Melbourne\u2019s Princess Theatre. He tells us his brother calling him a sissy prevented him from taking dance lessons; he dances joyously now, secure in himself and his interests. The message is clear: follow your dreams, no matter what others might say. He shows himself as a loving husband and father \u2013 he descends into the audience to waltz with Deborra-Lee Furness, his wife of 23 years \u2013 but he immediately jokes about making all the other husbands look bad. He\u2019s your mate. He plays piano onstage and immediately makes a self-deprecating joke about thinking he\u2019s somehow qualified to play a piano at an arena show (with specific apologies to Billy Joel). He brings out two children\u2019s choirs to sing You Will Be Found from Dear Evan Hansen, the reigning hit musical for sensitive teens, written by The Greatest Showman\u2019s songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. He casually says the musical will be coming to Australia next year; behind me, young women screamed in delight. And then Jackman begins the second act in character as Peter Allen, reprising his Tony award-winning turn as the Australian entertainer in The Boy From Oz. A woman is pulled from the audience to dance with him; she clings in delight. Jackman shakes his hips and moves like Allen, a little queerness in every step. Later, he mugs in Wolverine poses, joking that the X-Men fans in the audience must have been suffering all night. He knows he pushes the boundaries of acceptable bloke behaviour; he encourages you to let him. His audience is, typically, entranced. They cheer when the band plays the 20th Century Fox theme as Jackman describes his love for movie musicals. They even cheer at his take on Valjean\u2019s Soliloquy and One Day More from Les Mis\u00e9rables. Jackman\u2019s voice, which has always been more about charm and power than technique, serves him well in this enormous space. But when his special guest, The Greatest Showman\u2019s Keala Settle, emerges to sing generic-outsider anthem This is Me, her stunning voice brings people around me to tears. Jackman made space for her to shine. Later in the second act, he gives the stage over to Walmatjarri and Bunuba blues singer Olive Knight who, with son Clifton Bieundurry and didgeridoo players Paul Boon and Nathan Mundraby, performs a number in Walmatjarri. After Jackman joins them for a rendition of Israel Kamakawiwo\u2019ole\u2019s Somewhere Over the Rainbow, he speaks movingly about living in \u201can increasingly divided world\u201d and wanting to spread \u201cthe idea of reconciliation through art, through music, through culture\u201d. He hands Knight the microphone to translate her words into English, so we do not miss them: \u201cThe land is crying for its people. The people are crying for the land. Do not be silent. Speak up for her.\u201d The Man. The Music. The Show is a strange mix of earnest performance, a variety show for the heartfelt and easy-pushed buttons of popular entertainment. But popular entertainment is popular for a reason and it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the spectacle. When I told my ride-share driver why I was going to the Qudos Bank Arena, he brightened. He loves Hugh Jackman like he loves former world No 1 tennis player Pat Rafter, he said, because \u201cthey show Australia\u2019s face to the world\u201d. Jackman, perhaps, shows the world who we wish we were: a nation that has attempted to heal the genocide and systemic racism that haunts and hurts us; a nation where men don\u2019t routinely and violently kill women; a nation where gendered expectations are out the window. Where love and respect are the guiding tenets of our communities. And if that\u2019s who we wish we were, maybe there\u2019s hope for us yet. \u2022 Hugh Jackman: The Man, The Music, The Show is touring Australia until 3 September",
