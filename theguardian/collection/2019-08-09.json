In her time in the role, Allam worked on Guardian Australia\u2019s collaborative series with the University of Newcastle\u2019s colonial massacres research team, The Killing Times, which found there were at least 270 frontier massacres over 140 years as part of a state-sanctioned and organised attempt to eradicate Aboriginal people.

With Danny Tudhope aboard, he should do well in the Shergar Cup Stayers.</p> \n<p><strong>1.55 Haydock</strong> David O\u2019Meara does well with his imports and the ex-French <strong>Young Fire</strong> has a couple of bits of form to his name that suggest he might be nicely treated on this mark.</p> \n<p><strong>2.15 Ascot</strong> The Shergar Cup Challenge represents a welcome step down in class for <strong>Melting Dew</strong>, who has fared poorly in much hotter races this year.

Dettori\u2019s only mount on the card is Wissahickon, who has a lot to prove in such conditions.</p> \n<p><strong>3.45 Newmarket</strong> Charlie Appleby can win his first Sweet Solera with the talented <strong>Light Blush</strong>.

The first foal of a dual Listed winner, she won handily on her debut here and then was second in a Sandown Listed race to a horse on which Dettori delivered a fine ride from the front. 4.00 Ascot Another Balding contender on this card is Hero Hero, who was overstretched by a mile here at the Royal meeting but had previously impressed at Chester and looks the right type for the Sprint.",

Shortly after the explosion, gamma radiation levels in the neighbouring city of Severodvinsk reportedly jumped to 20 times their normal rate for nearly half an hour, contradicting the ministry\u2019s assurances that all levels were normal.</p> <p>Further explosions, injuring nine people, were reported on Friday at the site. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said in a statement it had been hit by lightning.</p> <p>Pharmacies in two northern Russia cities have reported increased sales of iodine, a chemical used to limit the effects from radiation exposure.</p> <p>Since the incident, a section of a bay in the White Sea has been closed to civilian shipping and photographs of rescue workers wearing protective gear including respirators have raised concerns about the accident. A statement put on the Severodvinsk city website about the heightened radiation levels has also <a href=\"http://www.severodvinsk.info/pr/17895/\">been deleted</a>, erasing some of the only official confirmation that the incident occurred at all.</p> <p>Reports on the Arkhangelsk news site 29.ru and the Interfax news agency said that local pharmacies had reported a run on iodine tablets since Thursday, and that locals were concerned about the possibility of exposure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/explosion-military-base-russia-arkhangelsk\">Two dead and radiation spike reported after Russia rocket test blast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey bought everything yesterday, first iodine tablets, iodomarin, then normal iodine and potassium iodide,\u201d one pharmacist told Interfax. \u201cThe fuss began around 17.00 and by the time we closed they had bought everything. People at the register were discussing the news about the radiation in Severodvinsk, the explosion and the soldiers.\u201d</p> <p>Footage obtained by the news site Mash showed emergency workers wearing protective suits with respirators putting an injured person into an ambulance. On Friday, the Baza news site reported that the injured men had been brought to a Moscow clinic for radiation poisoning treatment and released a video of a convoy of police cars and ambulances travelling through Moscow. The clinic and a defence ministry spokesman both declined to respond to questions about the report.</p> <p>It is not clear what rocket engine or weapon system was being tested at the military site. Russia\u2019s northern fleet, including its nuclear-powered submarines, is based nearby, and the explosion reportedly occurred near a firing range for submarine-launched ballistic missiles.</p> <p>Theories include an explosion aboard a ship with a nuclear reactor or a failed test of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile mentioned by Vladimir Putin during a televised speech in 2018. If the spike in radiation levels was a coincidence, fear of contamination from toxic jet fuel may also explain the use of protective gear during the operation to rescue those injured in the blast.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Russia\u2019s state nuclear agency Rosatom confirmed on Friday night that five of its staff members were killed in an accident during tests at a military site in northern Russia earlier this week. The accident occurred during tests on a liquid propellant rocket engine on Thursday, the RIA news agency said, citing Rosatom. Russian authorities had previously said two people had been killed in the incident and that a nearby city had reported a rise in radiation levels when a rocket engine blew up at a testing site in the Archangelsk region. Shortly after the explosion, gamma radiation levels in the neighbouring city of Severodvinsk reportedly jumped to 20 times their normal rate for nearly half an hour, contradicting the ministry\u2019s assurances that all levels were normal. Further explosions, injuring nine people, were reported on Friday at the site. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said in a statement it had been hit by lightning. Pharmacies in two northern Russia cities have reported increased sales of iodine, a chemical used to limit the effects from radiation exposure. Since the incident, a section of a bay in the White Sea has been closed to civilian shipping and photographs of rescue workers wearing protective gear including respirators have raised concerns about the accident. A statement put on the Severodvinsk city website about the heightened radiation levels has also been deleted, erasing some of the only official confirmation that the incident occurred at all. Reports on the Arkhangelsk news site 29.ru and the Interfax news agency said that local pharmacies had reported a run on iodine tablets since Thursday, and that locals were concerned about the possibility of exposure. \u201cThey bought everything yesterday, first iodine tablets, iodomarin, then normal iodine and potassium iodide,\u201d one pharmacist told Interfax. \u201cThe fuss began around 17.00 and by the time we closed they had bought everything. People at the register were discussing the news about the radiation in Severodvinsk, the explosion and the soldiers.\u201d Footage obtained by the news site Mash showed emergency workers wearing protective suits with respirators putting an injured person into an ambulance. On Friday, the Baza news site reported that the injured men had been brought to a Moscow clinic for radiation poisoning treatment and released a video of a convoy of police cars and ambulances travelling through Moscow. The clinic and a defence ministry spokesman both declined to respond to questions about the report. It is not clear what rocket engine or weapon system was being tested at the military site. Russia\u2019s northern fleet, including its nuclear-powered submarines, is based nearby, and the explosion reportedly occurred near a firing range for submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Theories include an explosion aboard a ship with a nuclear reactor or a failed test of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile mentioned by Vladimir Putin during a televised speech in 2018. If the spike in radiation levels was a coincidence, fear of contamination from toxic jet fuel may also explain the use of protective gear during the operation to rescue those injured in the blast.",

From the launch of the AFLW, NRLW and Super W competitions, to highly engaged audiences consuming football, cricket and netball World Cups, and individual domination in tennis, golf and surfing. It is tempting to conclude that women\u2019s sport is finally having its moment. But what converts it from a moment to the new normal? From a couple of minutes off the bench to a starting spot on the field? These are the questions that women\u2019s sport administrators and advocates are asking now as they look for ways to build on the momentum created and avoid being consigned to history. Speaking at the Women in Sport Summit in Melbourne this week, Kate Jenkins, the sex discrimination commissioner for the Australian Human Rights Commission, outlined six key challenges to gender equality in sport over the coming years. Equal pay and support from media and sponsors are two areas that come as no great surprise. Fan engagement is higher than ever, but most female athletes are still working second jobs while they chase their sporting dreams. This has a huge impact on the high performance environment as players desperately balance work, training, travel, sleep and food preparation. There is also a need to find a workplace that will support an employee who requires a great deal of flexibility for a significant part of the year, while needing full-time employment during the off-season. Participation at grass roots level is a huge growth area and one that is highly important to building elite competitions. With the boom in women\u2019s sport has come an awakening in how this element of sport is addressed. While growth in participation was once seen as a way to put more people into the pathways with the aim of uncovering the next generation of gold medal and World Cup winners, the focus has shifted. Sporting organisations are now realising that they require a lot more fans, administrators, grass roots officials and participants than they do elite players. As Golf Australia\u2019s female engagement manager Chyloe Kurdas described, it is about facilitating the game in a way that is driven by the needs of women and girls, not the needs of the sport. This has translated into creating quality, positive experiences, putting in place multiple entry points to the sport and valuing all levels of participation equally. While talent pathways may create the next generation of stars, there is little point in those stars competing on the world stage if there is nobody watching because the remainder of that generation has been burnt by highly negative experiences in the sport. Facilities and access remain key challenges from grass roots through to elite level. Issues such as change rooms that have been designed for the needs of male athletes through to scheduling of women\u2019s games and training sessions at times that are not conducive to performance or attracting spectators. Governance is another area that is being considered as the boards of sporting organisations make decisions on behalf of their female members often without having significant female representation. Chair of the Suncorp Super Netball commission and former Wests Tigers chair Marina Go spoke about the significant structural issues that exist in governance in many sports. She highlighted that it is not simply enough to add a woman to an all-male sporting board. Go emphasised the courage it takes to speak up when everyone else around the table disagrees. Her belief is that unless diversity is embedded in the fabric of the sport and driven from the top down, addressing targets in governance will continue to be a quick fix and will not promote lasting gender equality. The final challenge Jenkins put forward was respect for women. This is a thread that runs through every sport at all levels. It is not a challenge unique to the sporting environment but it is one that is highly significant in this arena. While it manifests itself in many ways, a key issue that now arises is the perception that for women to gain respect from male fans and administrators, they must fit into the masculine narrative of sport.

Leser argues that it wasn\u2019t always this way; that once, \u201cbefore the great creation legend of Genesis, before the myths of ancient Greece\u201d, where \u201cthe feminine was venerated\u201d, there were female healers, priestesses, lawmakers and warriors. It was only with time and \u201cnewer religions\u201d Christianity, Judaism and Islam, he says, that misogyny was seeded.</p> <p>Leser also discusses ways in which he believes men turn misogyny in on themselves. \u201cAs boys we quickly learn that these qualities we might loosely call feminine \u2013 tenderness, gentleness, vulnerability \u2013 are devalued and they are shamed, and they are repressed and often they are removed.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what do we say to boys? Don\u2019t be weak, don\u2019t be a sissy, don\u2019t cry. Boys learn when they are young to remove those parts of themselves that are part of their emotional range.\u201d</p> <p>Leser believes that this moment is particularly potent because the misogyny that has \u201ccoursed its way through history to the present day\u201d is now butting up against the \u201cunstoppable rise of women\u201d. He points to women in leadership positions, on company boards and in the corporate world as evidence of this unstoppable rise.</p> <p>But is women\u2019s ascent really as linear and uncomplicated as that? For all of the gains women have made \u2013 and they have been significant \u2013 there is the sense that things have stalled or in some cases gone backwards. Just ask a women outside the white, heterosexual mainstream how difficult it is to gain access to power, let alone find justice for those wrongs that are done to them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The act of writing is the act of understanding. But you have to write without looking over your shoulder</p> <footer> <cite>David Leser</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Leser\u2019s book contains interviews with second-wave feminists such as Helen Garner, traversing the so-called grey zones of sexual assault \u2013 ground that would be familiar to readers of The First Stone. It highlights, again, the political divisions between younger and older feminists.</p> <p>\u201cSome young people tend to think of themselves as a bubble of rights moving around the world and they\u2019re in this little shining enclosure and that\u2019s their rights,\u201d Garner says in the book. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone with road rage: anyone bumps against them and they go berko.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the voices of younger feminists and intersectional perspectives are largely absent.</p> <p>\u201cThe book should have been called Women, Men, The Whole Damn Thing Minus All the Things I Couldn\u2019t Talk About,\u201d Leser says.</p> <p>\u201cI was given five months to write this book. So there will be many things that readers will think should have been in the book or should not have been in the book. I could have spent months in Indigenous communities with the most at-risk women in this country. I could have spent months looking at the whole transgender LGBTQI community. I didn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t have time. I did what I could.\u201d</p> <p>So is this book written for men or women? Leser doesn\u2019t answer the question directly.</p> <p>\u201cThe act of writing is the act of understanding,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you have to write without looking over your shoulder or anticipating your audience because it\u2019s a terrifying and humbling task to write about something as fraught and complex as this.\u201d</p> <p>After getting the book contract, Leser interviewed people from around the world who are invested in the movement, such as former New Yorker editor Tina Brown; French secretary of equality Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa; and masculinity expert Michael Kimmel. Some of his interviewees had experienced abuse, some were accused of abuse, and some had devoted their lives to trying to make things better between the sexes.</p> <p>\u201cWriting this book reduced me to tears,\u201d Leser says. \u201cI was made privy to so much pain but there were times when I felt immobilised by that and I didn\u2019t think I could do it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/10/millennials-censorship-putney-sofka-zinovieff-lolita\">Are millennials really driving \u2018cancel culture\u2019 - or is it their overcautious critics?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are suggestions in this book about where to go from here, alluded to in writer Benjamin Law\u2019s cover blurb, which says the book should be \u201cair-drop[ped] onto footy ovals, boardrooms, electoral offices and boys\u2019 schools\u201d. But they involve men first recognising then giving up some of their privileges.</p> <p>Which privileges have you given up, I ask Leser.</p> <p>He talks about his 23-year marriage to a feminist woman, now over. \u201cI thought I was a progressive male. Actually, my work was more important. My projects were more important. My ambitions were more important and my needs were more important.

      "bodyText": "It was December 2017 and, like most of the world, veteran Sydney journalist David Leser was transfixed by the millions of women speaking out about sexual assault as part of the MeToo movement. \u201cIt was the biggest social movement of my lifetime,\u201d Leser tells Guardian Australia. Around the same time, the 63-year-old was asked by the editor of Nine\u2019s Good Weekend to write for the magazine. \u201cI said, \u2018The only story I\u2019m interested in writing is the Harvey Weinstein story.\u2019 That, to me, was the biggest story in the world,\u201d he says. Duly commissioned, Leser says the Good Weekend article \u2013 titled Men, Women and the Whole Damn Thing \u2013 started with the central question: \u201cCould a man \u2013 should a man \u2013 do this story?\u201d For some, the answer was yes. After all, the story of women\u2019s oppression can\u2019t be told without examining men\u2019s role as oppressors. But, for others, the thought that a man might be writing about women\u2019s pain, and might be offered significant platforms for his thoughts, was mansplaining in extremis \u2013 especially when the Good Weekend cover story was followed by a book deal. In the Australian, columnist Nikki Gemmell wrote: \u201cIt seems, uncomfortably, that men feel the need to colonise this courageous, fraught, intensely female #MeToo moment. And of course they\u2019re enabled; they always are. Men power through, drowning out our voices; they endure, cling on, mansplain to us.\u201d Van Badham told the Guardian\u2019s Amanda Meade: \u201cThis is precisely the structural sexism that MeToo has illuminated, and we\u2019re staring at it, and it\u2019s so very ugly.\u201d Elsewhere on feminist forums and social media, Australian women were incensed that the long-awaited moment of reckoning via the MeToo movement would be filtered through a male lens. Leser speaks to Guardian Australia at the Byron Bay writers\u2019 festival, where he is launching his book, also called Women, Men and the Whole Damn Thing. \u201cIf you say a man shouldn\u2019t write this book, my answer to that is men are the ones are perpetrating the violence, mostly,\u201d he says. \u201cThe vast majority of them are doing the abuse, the rapes, the [domestic] violence. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on men to know why men are doing this and to talk about it and to examine the models of manhood we\u2019ve been given, so that we understand it.\u201d As for his feminist critics: \u201cThe attacks on Van [Badham] by men online have been so vile, so poisonous, so hurtful.

But a common theme throughout is misogyny. Leser argues that it wasn\u2019t always this way; that once, \u201cbefore the great creation legend of Genesis, before the myths of ancient Greece\u201d, where \u201cthe feminine was venerated\u201d, there were female healers, priestesses, lawmakers and warriors. It was only with time and \u201cnewer religions\u201d Christianity, Judaism and Islam, he says, that misogyny was seeded. Leser also discusses ways in which he believes men turn misogyny in on themselves. \u201cAs boys we quickly learn that these qualities we might loosely call feminine \u2013 tenderness, gentleness, vulnerability \u2013 are devalued and they are shamed, and they are repressed and often they are removed. \u201cAnd what do we say to boys? Don\u2019t be weak, don\u2019t be a sissy, don\u2019t cry. Boys learn when they are young to remove those parts of themselves that are part of their emotional range.\u201d Leser believes that this moment is particularly potent because the misogyny that has \u201ccoursed its way through history to the present day\u201d is now butting up against the \u201cunstoppable rise of women\u201d. He points to women in leadership positions, on company boards and in the corporate world as evidence of this unstoppable rise. But is women\u2019s ascent really as linear and uncomplicated as that? For all of the gains women have made \u2013 and they have been significant \u2013 there is the sense that things have stalled or in some cases gone backwards. Just ask a women outside the white, heterosexual mainstream how difficult it is to gain access to power, let alone find justice for those wrongs that are done to them. Leser\u2019s book contains interviews with second-wave feminists such as Helen Garner, traversing the so-called grey zones of sexual assault \u2013 ground that would be familiar to readers of The First Stone. It highlights, again, the political divisions between younger and older feminists. \u201cSome young people tend to think of themselves as a bubble of rights moving around the world and they\u2019re in this little shining enclosure and that\u2019s their rights,\u201d Garner says in the book. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone with road rage: anyone bumps against them and they go berko.\u201d Meanwhile, the voices of younger feminists and intersectional perspectives are largely absent. \u201cThe book should have been called Women, Men, The Whole Damn Thing Minus All the Things I Couldn\u2019t Talk About,\u201d Leser says. \u201cI was given five months to write this book. So there will be many things that readers will think should have been in the book or should not have been in the book. I could have spent months in Indigenous communities with the most at-risk women in this country. I could have spent months looking at the whole transgender LGBTQI community. I didn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t have time. I did what I could.\u201d So is this book written for men or women? Leser doesn\u2019t answer the question directly. \u201cThe act of writing is the act of understanding,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you have to write without looking over your shoulder or anticipating your audience because it\u2019s a terrifying and humbling task to write about something as fraught and complex as this.\u201d After getting the book contract, Leser interviewed people from around the world who are invested in the movement, such as former New Yorker editor Tina Brown; French secretary of equality Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa; and masculinity expert Michael Kimmel. Some of his interviewees had experienced abuse, some were accused of abuse, and some had devoted their lives to trying to make things better between the sexes. \u201cWriting this book reduced me to tears,\u201d Leser says. \u201cI was made privy to so much pain but there were times when I felt immobilised by that and I didn\u2019t think I could do it.\u201d There are suggestions in this book about where to go from here, alluded to in writer Benjamin Law\u2019s cover blurb, which says the book should be \u201cair-drop[ped] onto footy ovals, boardrooms, electoral offices and boys\u2019 schools\u201d. But they involve men first recognising then giving up some of their privileges. Which privileges have you given up, I ask Leser. He talks about his 23-year marriage to a feminist woman, now over. \u201cI thought I was a progressive male. Actually, my work was more important. My projects were more important. My ambitions were more important and my needs were more important. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why my marriage foundered. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too late to do anything about that now ... I would never make that mistake again. I would try and bed down a reciprocity and a respect and a mutual regard for each other\u2019s lives and careers. When you see you are much further from where you might have been, it\u2019s a very sobering thing.\u201d \u2022 Women, Men and the Whole Damn Thing by David Leser is out now through Allen and Unwin",

      "bodyText": "Peter Galbraith was playing a high-stakes game. It was 2004 and, in the Dili heat, the distinguished US diplomat sat opposite Australian officials, bartering over a nation\u2019s future. Timor-Leste\u2019s government, with Galbraith as its chief negotiator, was desperate to get a fair deal from the bountiful underwater oil and gas reserves that lay between it and Australia, a trusted ally and regional powerhouse. Success would give it a significant share of fields worth $40bn-$50bn, helping lift the fledgling nation out of poverty. Failure would blow the tyres of an economy heavily reliant on natural resources. The game, though, was rigged. Unbeknownst to Galbraith, Australian Secret Intelligence Service (Asis) agents had been instructed to bug key offices of the Timor-Leste government. The listening devices would reveal Timor-Leste\u2019s bottom line, its negotiating tactics and the competing views of cabinet members. \u201cIt was outrageous,\u201d Galbraith tells Guardian Australia from his home in the US. \u201cI\u2019d taken protective measures against Australian espionage, which I thought would be based on cell phones and internet, but I thought it was pretty crude to be bugging the prime minister\u2019s offices. \u201cIt was not what you do to a friendly state. And it was not something you do for commercial advantage.\u201d The Asis operation remained secret. The treaty was signed. Australia secured a 50-50 split of the Greater Sunrise fields, positioned 450km north-west of Darwin and 150km south of Timor-Leste. It was a good deal for the Australian government, and a boon for the joint venture of multinationals, led by Woodside, seeking to exploit the Timor Sea. As a former US ambassador to Croatia, Galbraith had frequent access to US intelligence. Never has he seen his country attempt an operation as commercially driven as Australia\u2019s was. \u201cThe whole experience of the negotiation from 2000 on and through this whole episode was to see a country that \u2013 yes, in many ways focuses on the public good \u2013 but where corporate greed was a big part of it, because the Howard and Downer government, they were shills for the corporations,\u201d Galbraith said. \u201cThat was what was really important to them. \u201cThat is not something that goes on in the United States. It was pretty shocking.\u201d Australia\u2019s actions would have been buried in perpetuity, had it not been for one Asis operative, known only as Witness K. The senior intelligence officer felt deeply uncomfortable about the operation, which was mounted during a heightened regional terror threat due to the 2002 Bali bombings. He eventually approached the intelligence watchdog, the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS). The spy obtained permission to talk to an approved lawyer, Bernard Collaery, a barrister and one-time attorney general for the ACT. Collaery helped the Timor-Leste government build a case against Australia at The Hague, alleging the bugging had rendered the treaty void. The revelations were splashed across mainstream media, first through the Australian, then the ABC. In Timor-Leste, the pair were seen as heroes. \u201cWitness K, as the secret agent became known, and Collaery, are brave Australians,\u201d former Timor-Leste president Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta wrote last month while calling for the pair to be awarded his nation\u2019s highest honour. \u201cIndividuals with a conscience and courage, representing the very best of Australians as I know them \u2013 instinctively sympathetic to the underdog, the weak and vulnerable.\u201d The love for Collaery and Witness K runs deeper still among the Timor-Leste people, according to Prof Clinton Fernandes of the University of New South Wales, who has followed the case closely. Civil society groups have printed \u201csolidarity with Bernard Collaery\u201d T-shirts and banners, which Fernandes says will soon be a visible presence across Dili. \u201cThere\u2019s another aspect to this affair that most Australians haven\u2019t appreciated \u2013 the moral injury felt by the people of Timor-Leste,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cThey want Australia to be a good neighbour, not an eavesdropper who breaks the 10th commandment repeatedly. Collaery is a great Australian in their eyes.\u201d It\u2019s a stark contrast to their treatment in Australia. Witness K and Collaery now face jail time for helping correct what they saw as a gross injustice. This week, Witness K pleaded guilty to sharing protected Asis information. Collaery will fight on, facing a partially secret trial in the ACT supreme court, the court where he has spent much of his life practicing. The pair\u2019s actions embarrassed powerful forces within government, intelligence, and corporate Australia. Those forces would wait almost a decade to exact revenge. In the summer of 2013, young law clerk Chloe Preston was sitting alone at Collaery\u2019s home practice in Narrabundah, Canberra. Outside, the suburban streets were quiet, save for the gentle hum of the beehives Collaery keeps in his front garden. The doorbell rang about 9am. Preston remembers her shock at opening the door to 10 officers, including agents from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio). Collaery had flown to The Hague 24 hours earlier to ready Timor-Leste\u2019s case against Australia. The officers produced a warrant, most of which had been blacked out, and offered a simple explanation for their presence: \u201cnational security\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it as a national security issue then and I don\u2019t now,\u201d Preston tells Guardian Australia. \u201cWe were no threat to national security; this was a blatant bullying tactic by the Australian government, designed to intimidate.\u201d The raid lasted six hours, stretching well into the afternoon. The officers rifled through Collaery\u2019s documents. Preston remembers seeing one officer on the floor of Collaery\u2019s lounge room, reading through a folder of documents directly related to the arbitration between Timor-Leste and Australia. \u201cI remember thinking to myself that this was nothing short of cheating,\u201d Preston says. \u201cA party to a legal case, had just waltzed into their opponent\u2019s chambers, and seized their legal briefs. \u201cAs a law clerk, a week out from being admitted as a solicitor, and as an Australian citizen, who believed that I lived in a fair democratic country, I lost a lot of confidence in the government, and the law, that day.\u201d A second raid was taking place at the home of Witness K, who was preparing to give evidence at The Hague. Collaery called in to the ABC from Europe to express his fury, alleging Australia was trying to intimidate Witness K and stop him from giving evidence. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more crass than what has occurred,\u201d he said. The raids were just the start. Witness K\u2019s passport was seized, preventing him from flying to The Hague. His efforts to get it back stretched across six years of secret hearings in the administrative appeals tribunal. Collaery says Witness K was put through \u201csix years of seclusion, harassment and questioning\u201d. Collaery\u2019s own attempts to publish a book on the affair prompted threats of jail from the Australian government. The most shocking development came midway through last year. Timor-Leste had by then dropped its case against Australia, paving the way for the signing of a new treaty on the Timor Sea maritime boundary in March 2018. The revised deal was far more favourable to the smaller nation, and it is now expected to reap between 70% and 80% of total revenue. Three months after the treaty was signed, independent MP Andrew Wilkie revealed the Australian government had approved the prosecution of Witness K and Collaery. \u201cWith the diplomacy out of the way it\u2019s time to bury the bodies,\u201d Wilkie said under parliamentary privilege. Crossbench senator Rex Patrick accused prosecutors of sitting on evidence for three years to avoid a diplomatic incident. The pair were charged with conspiring to breach section 39 of the Intelligence Services Act for allegedly communicating information they obtained in the course of employment or an agreement with Asis. The case drew immediate condemnation from lawyers, former judges, academics, and civil society groups. Labor has, so far, been relatively quiet on the case. It has fallen on individuals such as former Victorian premier Steve Bracks and NSW shadow attorney general Paul Lynch to take up the cause. \u201cThis prosecution seems designed to punish whistleblowers,\u201d Lynch tells Guardian Australia. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse is that what they revealed should be deeply shaming to Australia. Australia\u2019s intelligence services were revealed to be illegally bugging a foreign government, when the substantial benefits would flow to private corporations \u2013 all at a time when our intelligence services should have focused on terrorist threats.\u201d The case against Collaery and Witness K comes as Australia pursues a range of whistleblowers with vigour. Prosecutors have lodged separate criminal proceedings against Richard Boyle, a tax office whistleblower, and David McBride, a military lawyer who leaked documents to ABC journalists. Other whistleblowers have faced threats and termination for revealing information clearly in the public interest. The cases have opened a debate about the adequacy of Australia\u2019s whistleblowing protections. This week, Griffith University integrity expert Prof AJ Brown and his team published a major study examining the experiences of whistleblowers. It found less than 1% of whistleblowers ended up going to the media, which Brown described as \u201cfar less external disclosure than we actually want or need\u201d if wrongdoing was to be properly addressed. Those who blew the whistle externally experienced at least a third more repercussions than whistleblowers who stayed internal, the research found. The report also identified a separate need to reform blanket criminal prohibitions on the unauthorised release of information, similar to those used to prosecute Witness K and Collaery case. Instead, secrecy laws should make allowances for disclosures in the public interest, the report said. Such an approach was recommended in 2010 by the Australian Law Reform Commission\u2019s inquiry into secrecy laws but has not been implemented. \u201cThe challenge was, and remains, how to ensure the general law protects all persons who might need to justifiably breach confidentiality, by enabling any person to call on and argue a public interest defence in such circumstances \u2013 such as traditionally existed under common law principles,\u201d Prof Brown\u2019s report found. \u201cSuch a reform would parallel improvements to whistleblower laws, rather than seeking to convert whistleblower protection laws into more general laws aimed at public disclosure of information.\u201d Fernandes, from UNSW, said the case speaks to another critical institutional failing: the inability for Australia\u2019s parliament to scrutinise intelligence operations. He said Australia could consider adopting the US model, where intelligence and judiciary committees are regularly briefed about intelligence collection programs. Select groups of congressmen also receive briefings on specific operation types prior to their occurrence, he said. \u201cThis preserves executive freedom while also ensuring a check on executive overreach,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cFurthermore, all members of the House and Senate intelligence committees and their key staffers are regularly provided with extended footage of completed operations involving, for example, drone strikes. These provisions should be adopted in Australia.\u201d Many questions remain about the Witness K and Collaery affair, not least about Alexander Downer, the former foreign affairs minister who went on to work for Woodside as a consultant after leaving office. Patrick, the crossbench senator, used parliamentary privilege earlier this year to highlight Downer and Woodside\u2019s role in the Timor Sea negotiations. \u201cThe bottom line here is that Downer (and Woodside) wanted to force East Timor, one of the poorest countries in the world, to surrender most of the revenues from Greater Sunrise, revenue it could have used to deal with its infant mortality rate \u2013 currently 45 out of 1,000 children in East Timor don\u2019t live past the age of one,\u201d Patrick told parliament. \u201cAnd yet our plan was to deprive them of oil revenue.\u201d But for all the questions, one thing remains clear for Preston, Collaery\u2019s former law clerk. \u201cWhatever happens from here, the courage they have displayed is already etched into Australian political history,\u201d she says. \u201cFor years to come, Australians, young and old, will learn of the two heroes who revealed the farce of politics in this country.\u201d",

They have caught the eye of the Museum of Australian Democracy, which wants a copy for its collection.</p> <p>The MoAD director, Daryl Karp, says the museum is always on the lookout for objects that tell a story and connect with the public, part of an effort to \u201crebuild <a href=\"https://www.democracy2025.gov.au/\">trust in the processes of civic engagement</a> \u2026 and encouraging people to be excited by democracy\u201d.</p> <p>She cites previous acquisitions including Julie Bishop\u2019s shoes, a tracksuit from John Howard, and a bicycle from Tony Abbott.</p> <p>Leigh\u2019s principles include noble sentiments that Labor communications \u201cshould try to engage with the better instincts of Australia, to tell stories, make new arguments and convey fresh facts\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we dumb down debates and demonise our opponents, progressives lose. When we enrich the public conversation, we win.\u201d</p> <p>That plea for positivity seems a bit incongruous, coming after the 2016 election which Labor almost won on the back of a negative campaign arguing the Coalition would privatise Medicare, and the 2019 election, in which Labor lost offering policies so extensive it seemed to be running as an incumbent government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dd7fef3db954372bcd7aec0f62fd3ea5a35bc32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd7fef3db954372bcd7aec0f62fd3ea5a35bc32/155_64_1268_761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labor MP Andrew Leigh with his 10 principles of politics at the Museum of Australian Democracy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labor MP Andrew Leigh with his 10 principles of politics at the Museum of Australian Democracy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Museum of Australian Democracy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe arguments go beyond any particular election cycle,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cYou can always tell a convincing story \u2026 about why some particular tactic might work in a certain moment of history.</p> <p>\u201cBut from an overall strategic standpoint the progressive side of politics is looking for opportunities to use the power of government to improve the quality of people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>\u201cI think back to Ronald Reagan, who said \u2018government isn\u2019t the solution, government is the problem\u2019. Reagan\u2019s demonising of the role of government and politicians was deliberate; he recognised his side \u2026 benefited when people trusted government less.\u201d</p> <p>Burned by an extremely negative Coalition campaign amplifying claims Labor would introduce a death tax and falsely claiming that Labor would tax non-electric cars, another colleague who now finds himself on the backbench \u2013 Ed Husic \u2013 has proposed his version of the high road: <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/let-s-disarm-the-trolls-husic-calls-for-fake-news-armistice-20190610-p51w97.html\">an \u201carmistice\u201d on fake news</a>.</p> <p>Leigh acknowledges the high road will be \u201ctough \u2013 but the alternative is to simply become Liberal-lite\u201d.</p> <p>He thinks Labor should be \u201cwitty and sharp\u201d in making its arguments but endorses Labor leader Anthony Albanese\u2019s direction <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/albanese-tells-mps-they-are-not-allowed-to-call-opponents-liars-20190718-p528jk.html\">banning MPs from calling opponents liars</a> because it is a currency that has become \u201cdebased\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/27/anthony-albanese-on-the-progressive-backlash-people-are-looking-for-easy-answers\">Anthony Albanese on the progressive backlash: 'People are looking for easy answers'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Leigh wants to make politics \u201ca bit more gracious and a bit less aggressive\u201d.</p> <p>And also \u2013 it would appear \u2013 a bit quieter. Media coverage, the 10 principles state, is \u201ca means, not an end\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 a reminder to myself and my team that while it might be pleasing to see your name in dispatches, the main game is improving people\u2019s lives,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cThere\u2019s always the risk for anyone in politics that you worry about column inches rather than about tangible improvements.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s often a question of whether you can achieve more quietly, internally, by collaborating with others by focusing on the outcome rather than on publicity \u2026 All of us have egos, and our challenge is to ensure our egos aren\u2019t what\u2019s driving things.\u201d</p> <p>Leigh\u2019s principles also aim to help keep politics human. They ask staff to \u201cact ethically, crack jokes when we can, and keep a sense of perspective\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t apologise for spending time with friends and family, exercising or reading fiction\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNot only is socialising important in itself; a well-rounded life helps us do our jobs better. Strive for calmness, balance and gratitude.\u201d</p> <p>Karp says the 10 principles are a \u201cdynamic entry point\u201d to understanding some of the contemporary challenges of modern politics, including the 24/7 media cycle, work-life balance, and the prevailing \u201ccombative approach\u201d to politics.</p> <p>\u201cIt represents an individual setting out their values and then standing by them,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether it becomes a substantial historical document is unknown, but for now \u2026 it speaks to the contemporary zeitgeist of visitors and the challenges of politics.\u201d</p>",

Now the former shadow assistant treasurer is candid that perhaps Labor had too many ideas \u2013 even if many were good ones. \u201cEnsuring that voters go into the polling booth understanding the core philosophy of Labor is what counts,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cYou can overwhelm with detail and [that\u2019s] certainly one of the critiques that\u2019s been made of the last election. \u201cIf that\u2019s correct then I\u2019m as guilty as anyone, having produced a whole raft of policy on competition, multinational tax and the like. \u201cSo I certainly take my share of blame for our election loss. But we can\u2019t change from being a party of policy to being a party of slogans and demonising.\u201d The MP, no longer on the frontbench but still a shadow assistant minister, has for several years hung 10 principles of politics on his wall. They have caught the eye of the Museum of Australian Democracy, which wants a copy for its collection. The MoAD director, Daryl Karp, says the museum is always on the lookout for objects that tell a story and connect with the public, part of an effort to \u201crebuild trust in the processes of civic engagement \u2026 and encouraging people to be excited by democracy\u201d. She cites previous acquisitions including Julie Bishop\u2019s shoes, a tracksuit from John Howard, and a bicycle from Tony Abbott. Leigh\u2019s principles include noble sentiments that Labor communications \u201cshould try to engage with the better instincts of Australia, to tell stories, make new arguments and convey fresh facts\u201d. \u201cWhen we dumb down debates and demonise our opponents, progressives lose. When we enrich the public conversation, we win.\u201d That plea for positivity seems a bit incongruous, coming after the 2016 election which Labor almost won on the back of a negative campaign arguing the Coalition would privatise Medicare, and the 2019 election, in which Labor lost offering policies so extensive it seemed to be running as an incumbent government. \u201cThe arguments go beyond any particular election cycle,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cYou can always tell a convincing story \u2026 about why some particular tactic might work in a certain moment of history. \u201cBut from an overall strategic standpoint the progressive side of politics is looking for opportunities to use the power of government to improve the quality of people\u2019s lives. \u201cI think back to Ronald Reagan, who said \u2018government isn\u2019t the solution, government is the problem\u2019. Reagan\u2019s demonising of the role of government and politicians was deliberate; he recognised his side \u2026 benefited when people trusted government less.\u201d Burned by an extremely negative Coalition campaign amplifying claims Labor would introduce a death tax and falsely claiming that Labor would tax non-electric cars, another colleague who now finds himself on the backbench \u2013 Ed Husic \u2013 has proposed his version of the high road: an \u201carmistice\u201d on fake news. Leigh acknowledges the high road will be \u201ctough \u2013 but the alternative is to simply become Liberal-lite\u201d. He thinks Labor should be \u201cwitty and sharp\u201d in making its arguments but endorses Labor leader Anthony Albanese\u2019s direction banning MPs from calling opponents liars because it is a currency that has become \u201cdebased\u201d. Leigh wants to make politics \u201ca bit more gracious and a bit less aggressive\u201d. And also \u2013 it would appear \u2013 a bit quieter. Media coverage, the 10 principles state, is \u201ca means, not an end\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 a reminder to myself and my team that while it might be pleasing to see your name in dispatches, the main game is improving people\u2019s lives,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cThere\u2019s always the risk for anyone in politics that you worry about column inches rather than about tangible improvements. \u201cIt\u2019s often a question of whether you can achieve more quietly, internally, by collaborating with others by focusing on the outcome rather than on publicity \u2026 All of us have egos, and our challenge is to ensure our egos aren\u2019t what\u2019s driving things.\u201d Leigh\u2019s principles also aim to help keep politics human. They ask staff to \u201cact ethically, crack jokes when we can, and keep a sense of perspective\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t apologise for spending time with friends and family, exercising or reading fiction\u201d. \u201cNot only is socialising important in itself; a well-rounded life helps us do our jobs better. Strive for calmness, balance and gratitude.\u201d Karp says the 10 principles are a \u201cdynamic entry point\u201d to understanding some of the contemporary challenges of modern politics, including the 24/7 media cycle, work-life balance, and the prevailing \u201ccombative approach\u201d to politics. \u201cIt represents an individual setting out their values and then standing by them,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether it becomes a substantial historical document is unknown, but for now \u2026 it speaks to the contemporary zeitgeist of visitors and the challenges of politics.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On Sydney\u2019s harbour, down by the southern end of the city\u2019s famous bridge, James Packer\u2019s dream is thrusting itself into the sky. The tower at Barangaroo that is to house Sydney\u2019s second casino is now 49 levels or 195m tall, skyscraper watchers say \u2013 much more than half way towards its eventual height of about 270m. But even as construction continues, the gambling empire Packer built, Crown Resorts, is under unprecedented scrutiny. After a fortnight in which allegation after allegation has been thrown at Crown, taking in everything from links to organised crime to accusations its high-rolling Chinese customers are given soft treatment by border officials, the NSW government on Thursday ordered a full-scale public inquiry. But while the focus of the media has largely been on lurid tales involving sex, drugs and illegal wombat shooting, the inquiry will also look into Packer\u2019s attempt to sell much of his stake in Crown to the Melco Resorts empire controlled by his friend and former business partner, Hong Kong casino billionaire Lawrence Ho, for about $1.75bn. The inquiry\u2019s head, former NSW supreme court judge Patricia Bergin, may find herself delving deep into the intertwined histories of the Packer and Ho dynasties. And the consequences could be severe \u2013 if Bergin finds that Ho shouldn\u2019t be allowed to buy the 20% of Crown he has agreed to take off Packer\u2019s hands, the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority can take \u201csuch action as it considers appropriate\u201d. No allegations have been made against Ho but documents tabled in NSW parliament on Thursday have raised questions about his links with his father, Stanley, who is banned from involvement in the Barangaroo project. Stanley Ho helped build Macau, the only part of China where casino gambling is allowed, from a sleepy former Portuguese colony into the Las Vegas of Asia. For many years he held a monopoly over the casino industry on the island. But Ho, who is now 97, has also been plagued by accusations of links to China\u2019s triad organised crime gangs; in 2010 he and one of Lawrence\u2019s sisters, Pansy Ho, were criticised by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement for allegedly allowing organised crime to thrive inside their casinos. Ho has always denied the allegations. To understand some of the issues Bergin is likely to explore, it is necessary to go back to 2004 when Packer\u2019s father, Kerry, got into business with Melco and Stanley Ho to develop casinos in the Chinese territory of Macau. Through a company in the British Virgin Islands called Great Respect, Stanley Ho convinced the Macanese government to give a joint venture between Melco and Kerry Packer\u2019s PBL a long lease over land in the tiny territory to develop a casino. In return, Great Respect got financial instruments that gave it the right to own a little over 10% of Melco International, which in turn is the majority owner of Melco Resorts. Documents tabled in parliament on Thursday show that since 2014 Great Respect has been on a previously secret list of 59 companies and people the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority banned from involvement with the Barangaroo casino because they are \u201cdeemed associates of Stanley Ho\u201d. This may be a problem for Lawrence Ho because, following a series of corporate shuffles, Great Respect now controls a little over 20% of Melco International. But when the deal went through in 2005, Melco International was effusive in its praise of the casino pioneer. \u201cDr Ho and Great Respect have been able to employ Dr Ho\u2019s strong and enduring links with Macau and its business community for the benefit of Melco, to secure the opportunity for the Melco group to obtain a long term lease in respect of the land, which is an opportunity which would not otherwise have been open to Melco,\u201d it said in an announcement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. That land eventually became the City of Dreams casino, a joint venture between Crown and Melco that opened in 2009. Over time, the bond between James and Lawrence became tighter. Their work together included the 2011 purchase by their joint venture, Melco Crown Entertainment, of the rights to the much-delayed Macau Studio City casino project, and building a second City of Dreams in the Philippines. Ho also featured heavily in a soft interview Packer did with the Seven network, broadcast in February 2013 as he was promoting his Barangaroo dream. It was \u201ca special friendship and a special relationship\u201d, Packer said. \u201cWe both have legendary fathers and it\u2019s great fun to have started out on this dream together.\u201d The tacky, hideously expensive party Melco Crown threw to celebrate Studio City\u2019s opening in October 2015 marked the high point of Packer\u2019s love affair with Asia, and his peak as a public figure. His then-girlfriend, the pop singer Mariah Carey, warbled on stage; Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese were there, chatting to the press about a bizarre 15-minute film \u2013 \u201cthe coolest 15 minutes ever made\u201d, Packer said \u2013 they had put together to plug the casino. But Packer was soon to cool on Macau. Just across the border from the enclave, Chinese authorities were becoming increasingly concerned about the amount of money leaving their tightly controlled country across the green felt of gaming tables. In 2016, Packer quit the joint venture with Lawrence Ho by selling Crown\u2019s shares in it. It was the beginning of a turbulent period for Packer during which he broke up with Carey (apparently she kept the engagement ring) and got dragged into a corruption investigation into Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And the following year mainland China turned toxic for Crown when authorities there arrested \u2013 and later convicted \u2013 19 staff for illegal gambling promotion. Packer wasn\u2019t on the board of Crown at the time and there is no suggestion he had any involvement in the episode. On 30 May this year, Packer struck his deal with Ho. It should have lightened Packer\u2019s load and given Melco a valuable foothold in the Australian market. But the presence of Great Respect in Melco\u2019s corporate structure may lead Bergin to question whether the company is suitable to be involved in running the Barangaroo casino. Bergin may also want to find out if Stanley Ho is still behind Great Respect. Back in 2005, Melco International said Great Respect was \u201ca company controlled by a discretionary family trust of Dr. Stanley Ho\u201d; but in more recent filings Melco Resorts says it is \u201ca company controlled by a discretionary family trust, the beneficiaries of which include Mr. [Lawrence] Ho and his immediate family members\u201d. Which ones, it does not say. Bergin may also want to look into why Ho took delivery of 10% of Crown on 6 June at the same time as he was a director of another family company banned from Barangaroo by the ILGA. A Melco spokeswoman said the company would cooperate with the inquiry. \u201cDr Stanley Ho does not hold any board seat in Melco International Development Limited, Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Limited or any other group companies, has no involvement in their business operations and does not exercise any influence on any financial and operating policies or other matters of these companies,\u201d she said. In full-page ads in News Corp newspapers, Crown has described reporting by Nine, which has led the media charge, as \u201ca deceitful campaign\u201d. It has had a lot less to say about the inquiry, issuing a short note to the stock exchange on Thursday evening pledging its cooperation. Meanwhile, Bergin is wasting no time. She has already used her powers, which are similar to those of a royal commissioner, to send notices to Crown and others (she would not say who) demanding information. This is in contrast to the Victorian regulator responsible for Crown\u2019s flagship Melbourne casino, which on Friday admitted it was yet to begin a probity approval process announced more than two months ago. Whatever the outcome of Bergin\u2019s investigation, Crown will pay \u2013 literally. Under the NSW Casino Control Act, it is a condition of its licence that it bear the cost of the inquiry.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Here\u2019s a summary of the evening\u2019s events: A major power cut left nearly a million homes without electricity and caused serious disruption on the UK\u2019s rail network. The problems affected vast swathes of England and Wales on Friday afternoon and into the evening. The National Grid said the outage was the result of losing two generators. It called the event \u201cunexpected and unusual\u201d but said its contingency plans included \u201cdisconnecting an isolated portion of electricity demand\u201d. Several of the UK\u2019s largest train stations were shut down because of the loss of power. That forced the suspension of many services for the whole evening. If you\u2019d like to read more, our full story is here: It seems some of the problems on the east coast line may be easing very slightly: A train has left King\u2019s Cross station headed for Peterborough. It was the first to leave since all services were halted earlier today. The train departed platform one at around 9.30pm despite no signage alerting passengers to the departure. Some were able to force their way through closed barriers to get onto the train. A staff member told other people waiting more trains might leave for Peterborough tonight but said she had \u201cno idea\u201d if services would run to other destinations. The National Grid has offered a little more detail on what, exactly, went wrong today. A spokesperson has said: This evening, we had an unexpected and unusual event, the loss of two generators that connect to the GB transmission system, which led to a fall in the frequency of the electricity system. Even though these events are outside of our control, we have plans in place to respond and the system operated as planned by disconnecting an isolated portion of electricity demand. We appreciate the inconvenience caused but this action allows the system to protect itself and limit the fall in frequency, allowing for power to be quickly restored. By 6.30pm, all demand was restored by the distribution network operators. The system is operating normally. There will be no more Thameslink or Great Northern services running north of London for the rest of the day, the operator says. The Govia Thameslink chief executive, Patrick Verwer, says: I understand this has been a very difficult evening for our customers and our staff. We continue to re-energise trains stopped in platforms but this will take considerable time which is why, despite our best endeavours, we are not able to run services north of London on the Thameslink and Great Northern routes for the rest of the day. Our priority is to look after our customers. We have put on as many buses as we can source, arranged for our tickets to be accepted by other transport providers and organised taxis wherever possible. Details are available on our website and nationalrail.co.uk. Passengers with tickets will be able to use these for travel tomorrow and Sunday. Prof Keith Bell, expert in electronic and electrical engineering at the University of Strathclyde has echoed Martin\u2019s comments (see 8.13pm), saying the power cut was similar to an outage 11 years ago. It seems to have been a very similar event to one in Britain in May 2008. However, this time we were kind of unlucky in that it was a deeper drop in frequency so more demand was tripped, and it happened during rush hour. It\u2019s fair to say that from a transmission system point of view, things have now been returned to normal, but the relays still tripped on the distribution networks. One likes to think that, with the green light from National Grid that things are OK at the transmission level, they can restore supplies pretty quickly. But how good have they been at managing the flow of information to ordinary people and, in particular, managers of facilities such as railway power supplies? In the interests of transparency, Prof Bell declares his interests: \u201cI hold the Scottish Power Chair in Smart Grids at the University of Strathclyde. (Scottish Power sponsors the Chair, not me. I speak as an independent academic. I have had various research projects over the years with the electricity companies, but only on the condition that results are published and, from my point of view, with the aim helping to improve engineering practice. I have also done work with government and Ofgem).\u201d CNN\u2019s Eliza Mackintosh has tweeted evidence of the frustration some rail passengers are feeling this evening: National Rail is stressing the scale of the problems at St Pancras: Alastair Martin, the chief strategy officer of the energy solutions specialist Flexitricty, said the UK energy system \u201chasn\u2019t seen anything like this for at least a decade\u201d. A similar energy system failure took place in May 2008 after the Sizewell B nuclear power plant tripped offline, two minutes before an outage at the Longannet coal-fired power plant. \u201cIt was a coincidence, but it was dramatic,\u201d he said. The twin outages also caused frequency to drop below the critical 50 Hz limit, which caused an automatic shutdown of parts of the energy grid, he added. What is interesting this time around is that the energy system recovered far quicker than it did then. National Grid is more prepared, and it has more tools to help restore the frequency of the grid when it is struggling with inertia. Footage has emerged of passengers being evacuated from a train in north London, which the operator says was travelling from Moorgate station. Govia Thameslink Railway\u2019s chief executive, Patrick Verwer, has said: The wide-scale failure of the power grid that has brought our Thameslink and many of our Great Northern trains to a stand north of London continues to cause major disruption. Despite our very best endeavours, we will not be able to run trains between London and Bedford, Cambridge and Peterborough and therefore advise customers they will not be able to travel on these routes for the rest of the day. Where possible, we are advising people to use alternative routes and our tickets are being accepted by other transport providers. The trains have been affected to the point where they require a technician to restart them and we are evacuating some of the trains that are stranded outside platforms. Our advice to customers is to stay on board trains for their own safety. At St Pancras station, the Guardian\u2019s correspondents have found a chaotic scene. Henry McDonald reports that commuters are taking matters into their own hands and starting to organise taxis to different destinations. They\u2019re clubbing together in large numbers to go to Watford, St Albans and Boreham Wood, he reports. One of them is the Guardian\u2019s own Nicola Davis, who reports having had to share a ride northwards to Hertfordshire after hours of waiting for information, having only made it as far as Finsbury Park station. At Kings Cross, Zoe Hebblethwaite, a 23-year-old legal secretary from Pontefract in West Yorkshire, has described the situation as \u201cabsolute mayhem\u201d. The 23-year-old has been stuck for hours, having arrived at the station at 5.30pm before being told to leave until further notice. They have closed doors of the station \u2013 no power whatsoever. Outside Kings Cross station is absolute mayhem nobody knows anything nobody can find an assistant to speak to at this point. No commuters are allowed in... There is so much confusion. Thomas Edward, a consultant at the energy specialist Cornwall Insight, says Little Barford tripped offline at 4.50pm and may have triggered the automatic shutdown of the windfarm. The key thing about today is that it is very windy. The strength of the system is determined by how many power plants you have running all at once. If there are a lot of power plants running and one has an outage, then the others can pick up the slack. Windfarms don\u2019t have the same level of stability as a power plant. So, on a windy day when we rely more on wind power thermal power plants, it is more difficult to manage. We need to know exactly what happened from National Grid and the network operators to understand the full cause of the blackout. We\u2019ve just had an updated statement from National Grid Electricity System Operator: Just before 5pm this afternoon, we saw a loss of supply from two separate power generators causing loss of power in selected UK areas. The issue is now resolved and the system has returned to normal. Our initial analysis indicates that system defences worked as expected during what was an unusual event. Anyone continuing to experience a local issue should contact their local Distribution Network Operator for assistance. Here\u2019s a summary of the rail network problems being reported by National Rail at the moment: All Great Northern and Thameslink routes are affected, with services subject to cancellations and delays until the end of the day. \u201cThere are currently no trains running in either direction between: London and Bedford [and] London and Cambridge/Peterborough,\u201d according to National Rail. East Midlands Trains services in and out of London St Pancras International may be cancelled or delayed by up to two hours. National Rail say the former is \u201cadvising customers not to travel to or from London St Pancras International this evening. Tickets for today will be valid tomorrow\u201d. All routes into and out of London King\u2019s Cross, including Grand Central, Hull Trains and LNER services, are severely affected and the station itself is closed. \u201cLNER and Hull Trains are advising customers not to travel from London King\u2019s Cross until further notice. Customers holding tickets for today, Friday 9th August, may use their tickets tomorrow Saturday 10th August,\u201d National Rail say. There are also likely to be problems between Birmingham New Street and Coventry, though these are not related to the power cuts. Mitchell Collier, from Rayleigh, Essex, was planning on travelling to Newcastle with friends. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s awful. We\u2019re going on a boys\u2019 weekend to Newcastle to watch the football and obviously we can\u2019t get there at the moment. There\u2019s been no updates from the train company, they\u2019ve just kind of shut the doors on us, just kicked us out.\u201d He added that the only information he and his friends were getting was from Twitter and the Trainline app. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ll potentially have to cancel the whole trip. That\u2019s the money gone, though, hotel and all that.\u201d Michael Ajibowu was trying to get home to Biggleswade in Bedfordshire. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve just come from Finsbury Park. I was stuck there for about an hour. I thought I\u2019d come down to central London for better access. When I got here the doors were locked.\u201d \u2022 This entry was amended on 13 August 2019 because Biggleswade is in Bedfordshire, not Hertfordshire as an earlier version said. Philippa Higgins was travelling to York when the power cut hit King\u2019s Cross. She was evacuated along with hundreds of passengers. She said: \u201cThere was overcrowding so they kicked us out. The guy who shut the door got yelled at but it\u2019s not his fault. There has been no information and I\u2019m just scrolling Twitter.\u201d While it\u2019s hard to be precise about how many people have been affected, especially once commuters are taken into account, PA Media estimates that there are close to a million customers facing blackouts, with 500,000 people affected in the Midlands, the south-west and Wales, and another 300,000 in London and the south-east. A spokeswoman for Northern Powergrid, which serves Yorkshire and the north-east, said 110,000 of its customers lost power, while Electricity North West said at least 26,000 people were without power in the north-west of England. Newcastle airport was also plunged into darkness by the power cut. Scott McKenzie was travelling through Newcastle airport when the power cut out for around 15 minutes, in what he was told by officials was \u201cdue to a wider problem in the region\u201d. \u201cIt was a bit worrying to start \u2013 more so because various alarms were going off and staff clearly didn\u2019t quite know what was going on either,\u201d the 31-year-old from Cardiff told PA Media. \u201cSome of the spaces in the airport have little daylight \u2013 we were literally plunged into darkness and people were using their phones as torches to see and get around.\u201d My colleague Fran Lawther is at King\u2019s Cross station in London, where she took this picture of passengers streaming out having been asked to leave. LNER tweeted that people should not attempt to travel to or from the station. Stockport was one of a number of areas to lose power earlier this afternoon, although it has now been restored.

Liverpool, acclaimed runners-up last season, start their attempt to climb one place higher by facing a side they did not have to play last term \u2013 because Norwich, of course, were busy romping away with the Championship. Both clubs are so convinced in their men and methods that neither did much to revamp personnel over the summer; Norwich made a few canny additions while Liverpool did nothing other than bring in Adrian as backup goalkeeper. Let\u2019s see how that pans out for them.</p> <p>The prognosis for this match is for a high-energy thriller. Norwich averaged more than two goals a game last season and, although they are unlikely to be reckless enough to charge out all guns blazing at Anfield, we can certainly expect them to try to mount regular attacks. They have the wherewithal to bother Liverpool. But can Teemu Pukki possibly score as prolifically as he did last season? And, bearing in mind how sharp Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team already looked in the second half of last weekend\u2019s Community Shield, is Norwich\u2019s defence capable of stopping Liverpool from tearing them to shreds? This has got goals written all over it.

      "bodyText": "\u201cFor 60 minutes we were really sharp, we were there, we did what we wanted to do. It was difficult for them in the first 60 minutes but I like what they did after that: staying that cheeky and lively, that\u2019s impressive. And they have a lot of good young players in that squad ... But we should have kept the ball better, but that\u2019s normal when you\u2019re not physically at your best ... The main problem today defensively was the reaction to the second balls.\u201d On Alisson\u2019s injury: \u201cHe thought something hit him in the calf and that\u2019s never a good sign. That probably means it\u2019s a bit more than a strain but we don\u2019t know. So we have a bit of a problem because our No3 keeper (Caoimhin Kelleher) is injured - he\u2019s coming back but he\u2019s not there yet.\u201d That sounds like an opportunity for any out-of-contract keepers out there. \u201cWe are disappointed because we lost. But I\u2019m unbelievably pleased with the character of my team ... to go back and win the second half. But over all we are disappointed we lost. I\u2019m happy with my players\u2019 character and their reaction and we\u2019ll go exactly the same way again in the coming weeks. I want us to be brave and go out and play football with mates: of course we have to be more solid and concentrate more because small details can make a big difference. After a loss you are always in a bad mood but there were positives here.\u201d Pukki: \u201cIt was a pretty good second half from us. I think we can take something from that for next week. We were a bit sloppy when they scored but otherwise it was all right.\u201d Krul: \u201cUnfortunately they were on it from the start and unfortunately we gave them a couple of gifts in the first half but we reacted really well. We were a bit naive in the first, which can happen when you\u2019re a young team. But it was a massive learning curve and I\u2019m proud of how we played in the second. It was a massive learning curve. Everybody walked off thinking \u2018you know what, if we believe in what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re going to be a good side this year for sure\u2019.\u201d The first match of the season ends with the expected result but not necessarily with the obvious conclusions: Liverpool will not be especially pleased with their performance despite the emphatic scoreline, because Norwich practically gave them some of the goals and they themselves looked jittery at the back at times; meanwhile Norwich, while aghast at the defending in the first half, will not be too dispirited by a heavy defeat; they showed they can play and cause problems to top teams and, by the way they improved in the second half, they showed they have heart and are fast learners - they could stay up and they\u2019re sure to entertain this season. 90+1 min: Godfrey pumps one at goal from over 20 yards. Adrian blocks but can\u2019t hold the low shot, and Hernandez is first to the rebound. But Alexander-Arnold closes him down to prevent him getting off a shot. 90 min: Norwich are determined to finish on the attack. Liverpool\u2019s defenders are finding them very pesky. 88 min: Hernandez and Lewis combine down the left to win a corner. It\u2019s taken short, whereupon Norwich\u2019s play become a bit too convoluted and they wind up giving the ball back to Liverpool by wandering offside. Liverpool substitution: Milner on, Firmino off. The departing Brazilian gets rapturous acclaim in recognition of a splendid performance. Or were the crowd cheering the streaker who ran across the pitch? 85 min: Alexaner-Arnold curls it around the wall, but straight at the keeper, who pushes it out for a corner. 84 min: Firmino beats Hanley to the ball on half way, then spins and dashes towards the area. Handley catches up with him at the edge of the box and brings him down. Freekick to Liverpool in a mighty promising position - possibly too close for Alexander-Arnold; my money is on Salah. Norwich substitution: Drmic on, Pukki off. The Swiss striker comes on for his debut. 80 min: Buendia goes for a goal with a 25 yard freekick. Easy pickings for Adrian. 78 min: Sloppy play between Man\u00e9 and Firmino in midfield gives Norwich a chance to nick the ball and spring forward, which they do in great numbers. Nothing comes of it but it\u2019s a positive sign for the visitors and further evidence that despite winning this match comfortably, Liverpool have not been especially convincing today. 76 min: Yet more beautiful play by Firmino \u2018in the hole\u2019. He then slips in Mane, who pulls a low ball back towards Henderson. Hanley intervenes to put it out for a corner. Salah\u2019s delivery is cleared. Liverpool substitution: Man\u00e9 on, Origi off. Good luck, Norwich. 73 min: Alexander-Arnold has a bang from nearly 30 yards. A pretext, seemingly, for the local boy to offer a ball to a chum in the crowd. 71 min: Salah directs another corner towards Van Dijk but this time Norwich are wise to it and head clear. 69 min: Nice work by Firmino to create a chance for himself, but his blast from 20 yards veers off target. 68 min: It\u2019s surprising that Klopp has not made another substitution yet given the busy schedule Liverpool have. Is he expecting the title to come down to goal difference? Norwich substitution: Hernandez on, Trybull off. 67 min: Norwich are preparing to introduce Onel Hernandez, who\u2019s a delightfully tricky and powerful wideman. \u201cWe\u2019re better than Barcelona,\u201d chirps Paul Bradford after Norwich cut the deficit to 4-1 (and no, to those asking, I did not put money on that scoreline despite predicting it before kickoff). 65 min: Norwich have a spring in their step and are playing as if they know they could score more. And they\u2019re right: they can create chances and Liverpool have been iffy at the back. Buendia spots a smart run by Pukki and provides a dainty through-ball. The Finn produces a perfect finish, denying Adrian a clean sheet and restoring some dignity for Norwich. 63 min: That\u2019s more like it from Leitner. He lets fly with a fierce striker from 15 yards, from a difficult angle, forcing Adrian to tip it over. 61 min: Leitner\u2019s first involvement is a frustrated late trip on Henderson for which he\u2019s booked. Not the impact he was hoping for. 60 min: Krul tells his players to push forward so he can send a goal kick long. That\u2019s sensible given how often they have been dispossessed while trying to play out from the back Norwich substitution: Leitner on, Stierpemann off. 58 min: Robertson takes a dropping ball nicely and then fires a 20-yards shot wide of the far post. 56 min: Firmino has again been excellent today, so creative, clever and unselfish. You\u2019d like to see him score as a reward for all the great work he does. You can say that after nearly every match he plays. 55 min: Fabinho tries to sidefoot one into the bottom corner from 25 yards. Krul fumbles it but recovers in time to stop Henderson from prodding in the rebound. 53 min: Salah, darting into the right-hand side of the area, tries to use the last defender as a guide around which he could bend the ball into the far corner. IT\u2019s a good effort but misses the target by a yard. 52 min: Van Dijk spanks a superb diagonal pass forward to Alexander-Arnold, who skips into the box and wins a corner. He takes it himself, and wastes it. 49 min: Buends flights over a clever inswinging freekick from the left. Norwich runners break the offside trap but can\u2019t get a good touch on the ball. 48 min: Origi flies down the left and delivers low cross into the area. Firmino sells as beautiful dummy to to let the ball run into the path of Henderson, who shoots firs time from 15 yards. Krul pushes it on to the bar! Liverpool quickly regain possession. Alexander-Arnold sends a low cross to the back post, where Firmino gets it under control but takes an age to turn and then shovels an awkward shot wide from four yards! 46 min: Technological glitch sorted, the second half finally gets underway. Now have Norwich resolved the communication problems in their defence? There\u2019s a slight delay to the start of the second half because the one of the officials has a problem with his earpiece. The players amuse themselves by knocking balls around among themselves while the officials try to find some replacement kit. Some fans are booking. Jimmy Hill would have sorted this out by now. Fabinho clatters into Henderson as both challenge for the ball in midfield. Henderson is hurt and may need some magic sponge action at half-time. Other than that and Allison\u2019s injury, this has been an ideal start to the campaign for Liverpool. They were allowed to ease into the game, getting away with some sluggishness thanks to bad Norwich finishing and even worse Norwich defending. As the half wore on, Liverpool found a groove and threatened to crush the visitors. Farke\u2019s team have been dangerous in patches - and Liverpool a tad brittle at the back - but the visitors played right into Liverpool\u2019s hands in others: they\u2019ve suggest they can score, but tightening up needs to be their priority for the second half. David Seare [19.38] is a seer. 45+2 min: Aarons hurls himself bravely in front of a shot by Firmino. Norwich will make it to the interval only four down. \u201cWow, and this is without Luis Suarez,\u201d chuckles Matt Dony. 45 min: Alexander-Arnold curls in another dangerous cross. This time there is a defender close enough to the forward - Firmino - to make the header difficult. No goal. 43 min: A gorgeous backheeled pass from Firmino is the highlight of another flowing Liverpool move. They\u2019re having fun now. \u201c\u201cIn Brisbane, Australia, I got up at 4:45am to ride into town to watch the game at the pub (Yes, there\u2019s a bar that\u2019s open at all hours for this kind of thing),\u201d says Murray Henman. \u201cOnly I went down to the garage to find my bike had been nicked. At least Liverpool are winning.\u201d Sorry to hear that, Murray. I\u2019d like to think it was just a buddy who took your bike to stop you from cycling back from the pub drunk? It\u2019s lovely cross from Alexander-Arnold but hapless defending from Norwich to leave Origi free 12 yards out. The Belgian takes full advantage, heading into the net. Liverpool substitution: Allison can\u2019t continue. On comes Adrian for his first appearance, just days after joining the club. Allison looks miffed and walks off with a slight limp. It looks like this might be an injury that keeps him out for at least a little while or maybe it\u2019s just a case of taking no risks because Liverpool are 3-0 up. 36 min: Allison seems to have hurt himself by while slipping after kicking the ball out. He needs treatment. Might we be about to see an early debut for Adrian? 35 min: Pukki skitters down the left, showing impressive pace to win a corner off Alexander-Arnold. Trybull\u2019s gets his head to the incoming corner but nods a yarad wide. 33 min: Norwich are reeling and Liverpool are starting to make merry. Half-time is a long way away: the contest is over but Norwich\u2019s pain could yet deepen. On the other hand, if they cane find a way to at least reverse the flow of play for the rest of this game, they\u2019ll have a positive to take into the rest of the season... 31 min: Alexander-Arnold pings a cross in from the right. Firmino takes it beautifully on his chest, sending it upwards to give himself time to adjust his feet for a spectacular volley from 16 yards. Krul bats away a brilliant effort! Robertson\u2019s cross is deflected out for a corner. Salah delivers a perfect centre and Van Dijk plants a downward header into the net from seven yards while holding off Lewis. Without playing particularly well, Liverpool are running away with this. 26 min: Stieperman cracks off a decent shot at last, after a lovely flowing ove by Norwich. Allison makes a competent save to push away the German\u2019s swirling shot from 18 yards. 25 min: Buendia, as expected, is involved in everything inventive that Norwich are doing. Their fullbacks are in the thick of it, too. They are going to score a lot this season. And concede a lot. \u201cOh gods, so the first goal of the new season is an own goal?\u201d blurts Bob O\u2019Hara. \u201cEven our footballers are doing political satire now #brexit\u201d 23 min: That\u2019s better from Norwich. Buendia slips a cute pass through to Pukki. Allison charges out to make a save ... and oh, Pukki was offside anyway, by maybe a millimetre. But there\u2019s no doubt they carry a threat so Liverpool can\u2019t nod off just yet. 21 min: Liverpool have their danders up now. Norwich need to find a way to stemming the flow or this could get ugly for them. Thats more like it from Salah! He pounced on a loose ball after Alexander-Arnold lost it, then, with the help of a little deflection, he exchanged a nifty one-two with Firmino before sliding it past the advancing Krul and into the far corner from six yards. 17 min: Salah robs the ball off a Norwich defender and then races into the area. He has Firmino appealing for a pass in the middle but he ignores that fact and instead tries to wriggle into a shooting position, but he\u2019s foiled by two defenders. There\u2019s a fine line between self-confidence and selfishness. 16 min: Robertson has a bash from 20 yards. Krul parries. 15 min: More nice play by the visitors! Twice they open Liverpool up but twice Pukki is unable to finish. First his hesitancy enable Van Dijk to get back and block, then he fired wide from a difficult angle. 14 min: Origi hurtles down the left and pings over a dangerous cross. No one manages to get on the end of it but they Firmino and Salah came close enough to elicit \u2018oooh\u2019 from the crowd. 13 min: Norwich pass the ball and make triangles all over the pitch. It\u2019s scruffiness at the extremities that\u2019s cost them so far. 11 min: The Anfield crowd are in full voice but their team is not yet truly on song even though they\u2019re got the lead. But Robertson is starting to make dangerous runs down the left... 9 min: Norwich pounce on sloppiness by Alexander-Arnold and Fabinho. They tear forward rapidly and again work the ball to Stieperman about 16 yards out .... and again he sends his shot skywards! What a blow for Norwich! Robertson released Origi down the left. Origi fired in a fairly innocuous low cross that Hanley seemed certain to clear. But he got himself in a muddle and shanked it backwards into his own net from six yards instead! Let\u2019s hope that hasn\u2019t set the tone for their season. It\u2019s certainly put them in the much in this match. 5 min: A slack pass from Allison - not entirely uncharacteristically - gives Pukki the chance to nick possession. He pulls it back from the byline to Stieperman, who leans back and lifts the ball high over the bar from 16 yards while under pressure. A let-off for Liverpool. 3 min: Salah pesters Godfrey into conceding a corner. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s delivery is uncharacteristically shoddy, allowing Norwich to clear. 1 min: Norwich get the 2019-20 Premier League season under way. It\u2019s all uphill from here. They negotiate the first minute well - it\u2019s 44 seconds before Liverpool get a touch. And then comes a poor one from Origi. \u201cIn response to Marie Meyer - Yes, I used to be fun at parties, but not any more,\u201d admits David Seare. \u201cThese days I simply remember the old days and warn young people off my garden. Their music has no words I understand and the tunes mean nothing to me. On the other hand, tonight\u2019s game is such a mis-match that even the most committed of Tweeters can\u2019t see the Canaries anywhere than down a mine with no air. I\u2019m off now to prune something and chunter about the value of a solid forward defensive.\u201d The Anfield crowd croon happily along to You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. Kickoff is imminent ... \u201cFirst time caller, long time listener,\u201d begins Michael Coppejans. \u201c Rocking out here in Finland where a Pukki party is underway (literally there is an official gathering with the Finnish Football Association bigwigs involved). First Finn playing in the Prem since Hyypi\u00e4 is a big deal here. Pukki\u2019s had a great year in the national team as well and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he poaches a goal tonight. However, LFC at Anfield can\u2019t be taken lightly either and expect them to triumph in the end. That being said the game will at least be more exciting then the Champions League final, right?\u201d Yes please! \u201cThis match \u2018undermines sports as an idea\u2019 - really!?\u201d gasps Mary waltz. \u201cFor generations in all sports, underdogs have played heavily favoured teams. Are upsets rare? Of course, that\u2019s what makes them so special.\u201d \u201cTucker Jenkins in Krull is nothing compared with Peter Duncan popping up in Flash Gordan,\u201d booms Emlyn Hatch. All this talk of unlikely heroes keeps bring us us back to Origi, doesn\u2019t it? \u201cI\u2019d like to start with the obligatory \u2018I bet David Seare is fun at parties\u2019 before moving swiftly on to the observation that if people were interested in every contest being 50:50, televised coin-flipping would be a thing,\u201d chimes in Marie Meyer. \u201cAlways held at neutral venues, naturally.\u201d Come on You Heads! \u201cCautious optimism from me,\u201d whispers Simon Cordery. \u201cDespite Klopp\u2019s brave words about not taking the Canaries lightly, his players will (you did). Norwich have everything to prove, especially that they are not immediately destined to return to the Championship. Final score 2 - 2, a moral victory for East Anglia and a dent in the Reds\u2019 title hopes.\u201d That\u2019s the spirit, Simon. Except I\u2019m not taking Norwich lightly - I fully recognise their qualities, but I also see their vulnerabilities, especially at the back. Controversially, I think Liverpool are better than them. \u201cI\u2019m excited to watch Teemu Pukki,\u201d discloses Steve Forstneger. \u201cFirst, one of my favorite all-time hockey players was Teemu \u2018The Finnish Flash\u2019 Selanne, as speedy on the ice as he was in his collection of exotic cars. Secondly, I recently enjoyed the Finnish comedy HeavyTrip, about a death metal band\u2019s perilous trek to play a festival in Norway. Anyway: Origi hat trick.\u201d Don\u2019t quite follow your workings there, Steve, but enjoyed them, all the same. However, much as I admire Origi, I do think Liverpool may rue not recruiting another, better forward. And, ideally, a creative midfielder. \u201cGood luck for the season, Paul,\u201d begins David Seare before getting down to brass tacks: \u201cThis is the kind of game that undermines sport as an idea. 22 players take the field today knowing who will win. It isn\u2019t sport, it\u2019s complicated advertising. On the upside my local radio station has enabled a cheap pizza to be coming my way. I used to love football.\u201d Anyone out there see Norwich proving him wrong? My head says a 4-1 home win. Brendan wants to defend the film Krull, sort of [see 19.24]. \u201cBernard Breslaw as a vengeful cyclops and Tucker Jenkins as a supporting hero? Whatever imagination they had went on to that casting,\u201d he notes. \u201cI have this almanac software on my computer that says this is day 121 of the year,\u201d announces Marcus. \u201cNow I happen to know that \u2018u\u2019 is the 21st letter in the alphabet. So that makes this day AU, since A is the first. So my question is who will get AU today? AU is of course gold in the periodic table symbols.\u201d You\u2019ve got it all wrong, Marcus: you could do sincere 1-2-1 chat, but not with me. And you also need an almanac that can count. \u201cIs that Krul in Norwich\u2019s goal the same Krul that used to be at Newcastle?\u201d asks Pearson. \u201cWhenever I see that name, I am reminded of a poor mid 80s science fantasy movie by the same name.\u201d It is the very same Tim Krul, Pearson, and he\u2019s a weak link, if you want my opinion. Oh, and the movie was called Krull, which was the name of a planet invaded by a ferocious beast called ... Beast. Not all science fiction movies are triumphs of the imagination. I\u2019d hate to be Daniel Farke\u2019s secretary: he fires out words at a speed that could melt fingers. This is more or less what he said: he began by addressing the point that his side were the top scorers away from home last in all four divisions \u201cThat doesn\u2019t count any more. This is a new challenge for us, one of the places you can go. Liverpool are one of the top teams in the world, if not the best.\u201d Asked whether it is a gamble to come and attack Liverpool, he says they couldn\u2019t do it any other way even if they wanted to, because they don\u2019t have the players to play differently. \u201cIt\u2019s not a gamble, there is no other option for us. We are still paying for some of the sins of our past so we were not able to spend unbelievable amount of money over the summer. So let\u2019s see what we can do. We have to get a lot of topics right. We can\u2019t just park the bus .. we need many periods in the game where we have possession and we have to be very precise in our pressing.\u201d \u201cWe should be ready but we have to prove that,\u201d he announces before responding to a question about why Liverpool didn\u2019t reinforce during the summer. \u201cWe were looking for one or two things and it didn\u2019t work out but there\u2019s no panic about that. If we don\u2019t find the right one, we don\u2019t do it.\u201d As for the threat posed by Norwich, he\u2019s sure not playing it down: \u201cNorwich deserve all our respect because how they got promotion last season was exceptional. They are a special team.\u201d It\u2019s the same lineup that started the Community Shield, with Sadio Man\u00e9 deemed only sharp enough for the bench. Norwich, meanwhile, do not include any of their summer signings, they\u2019ll be looking to the slinky Emi Buendia to pull strings for them in midfield. Liverpool: Allison; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Origi Subs: Adrian, Milner, Matip, Keita, Man\u00e9, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Shaqiri Norwich: Krul; Aarons, Hanley, Godfrey, Lewis; McLean, Trybull, Buendia, Stiepermann, Cantwell; Pukki Subs: Fahrmann, Byram, Roberts, Vranjcic, Leitner, Hernandez, Drmic Referee: M Oliver &amp; VAR To quote Alice Cooper: \u266a\u266b hello, hurray, let the show begin!\u266a\u266b The Premier League is back, baby, and it\u2019s kicking off with a doozy of a duel. Liverpool, acclaimed runners-up last season, start their attempt to climb one place higher by facing a side they did not have to play last term \u2013 because Norwich, of course, were busy romping away with the Championship. Both clubs are so convinced in their men and methods that neither did much to revamp personnel over the summer; Norwich made a few canny additions while Liverpool did nothing other than bring in Adrian as backup goalkeeper. Let\u2019s see how that pans out for them. The prognosis for this match is for a high-energy thriller. Norwich averaged more than two goals a game last season and, although they are unlikely to be reckless enough to charge out all guns blazing at Anfield, we can certainly expect them to try to mount regular attacks. They have the wherewithal to bother Liverpool. But can Teemu Pukki possibly score as prolifically as he did last season? And, bearing in mind how sharp Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team already looked in the second half of last weekend\u2019s Community Shield, is Norwich\u2019s defence capable of stopping Liverpool from tearing them to shreds? This has got goals written all over it. Let\u2019s be having you!",

Always I thought he was ours.\u201d Guardiola is confident City have adequate cover. \u201cThe fact he\u2019s not here \u2013 in the first season we didn\u2019t have G\u00fcndogan, then Benjamin [and we still managed],\u201d the manager said. Following Vincent Kompany\u2019s departure David Silva was elected captain by his teammates. \u201cDavid Silva will be our captain with Fernandinaho, Kevin [De Bruyne] and Sergio [Ag\u00fcero] as deputies,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cDavid has to be what he is. He\u2019s one decade here, knows the Premier League and has big respect.\u201d City, who are aiming to join Manchester United as the only team to win three consecutive titles in the Premier League era, start their season at West Ham in Saturday\u2019s early game. Guardiola believes he has no reason to question his players after their historic domestic treble. \u201cIn the beginning [of pre-season] we spoke about mentality, and why should I doubt them after what they\u2019ve done?\u201d he said. \u201cIn China [on tour] they did it and this week especially, in training they are so focused, [although] that isn\u2019t a guarantee to win games. But without that it\u2019s impossible; that\u2019s the first step. When I see that I can see we will be competitors. \u201cLast season when you asked me about back-to-back titles I said it\u2019s tough. Of course it would be great and incredible [to win a third] but when you are in this position, you try to make the team play good, don\u2019t think too much \u2013 there is no sense to think about the Premier League as it\u2019s far away. We should prepare for each of the first four games.\u201d Riyad Mahrez has been cleared by UK Anti-Doping after fears he could fail a doping test ruled him out of selection for the Community Shield. He had taken an unknown medicine while on international duty. \u201cAfter this week they came and tested him and he\u2019s ready for tomorrow,\u201d Guardiola said.",

Everyone associated with the eight-time Super League champions will have feared the worst here when, with half-an-hour remaining, the Rhinos were reduced to 12 men.</p> <p>Leading by just eight points at that stage, the Leeds of as recently as a few weeks ago would have perhaps collapsed. Instead, the manner in which they put a Catalans side harbouring title ambitions this season to the sword underlines the growing belief that relegation here is now highly unlikely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/08/warrington-st-helens-super-league-match-report\">Saints\u2019 Jack Welsby and Matty Costello combine to finish off Warrington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Four points clear of bottom-placed London, with a superior points difference to boot, this \u2013 combined with last week\u2019s 44-0 win at Huddersfield \u2013 looks more like a top side, as opposed to the one that has been struggling all season. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dealing with a side fearful of relegation,\u201d Richard Agar, Leeds\u2019 interim coach, said.</p> <p>But as impressive as Leeds were following Brad Singleton\u2019s dismissal, questions must be asked of how Catalans can produce performances as abject as this. They had clawed back a 16-0 deficit to trail by only eight at half-time, but any hopes of a victory vital for their own play-off hopes evaporated in spectacular fashion when they were handed a man advantage.</p> <p>\u201cIt looked like we were the team who were a man light,\u201d Steve McNamara, the Catalans coach, said. They were outplayed for the opening half-hour, with tries for Ash Handley and Rhyse Martin, coupled with four goals from the back-rower, making it 16-0. Mickael Goudemand\u2019s try helped narrow the gap to eight - but what followed after half-time was spectacular. Leeds had to survive the first 10 minutes of the second half without Konrad Hurrell following a sin-bin, but when Singleton was sent off shortly after he returned, the Rhinos were then under huge pressure. \u201cIt was a moment that galvanised us,\u201d Agar added. Within five minutes of that, they went further ahead when Handley scored his second.</p> <p>As McNamara said, Leeds now looked like the team a man up. Brad Dwyer\u2019s run close to the line then enabled Richie Myler to score, and the scrum-half then claimed his second after his half-back partner, Robert Lui, ghosted through before Lui\u2019s wonderful pass sent Luke Briscoe over in the corner.</p> <p><strong>Leeds</strong> Walker; Briscoe, Newman, Hurrell, Handley; Lui, Myler; Seumanufagai, Lunt, Cuthbertson, Ferres, Martin, Merrin. <strong>Interchange</strong> Donaldson, Singleton, Dwyer, Sutcliffe. <strong>Tries</strong> Handley 2, Martin, Myler 2, Lui, Briscoe. <strong>Goals</strong> Martin 10. </p> <p><strong>Catalans</strong> Gigot; Mead, Romano, Wiliame, Tierney; Bird, Langi; Bousquet, Da Costa, Simon, Edwards, Whitley, Casty. <strong>Try</strong> Goudemand. <strong>Goals</strong> Gigot 2.</p> <p><strong>Interchange</strong> Goudemand, Albert, Maria, Kasiano.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> R Hicks. <strong>Attendance</strong> 11, 336</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was not too long ago that Leeds Rhinos supporters will have been desperate for this miserable season to end; but at this rate, they will be ruing the fact it doesn\u2019t last for at least a few more weeks. Everyone associated with the eight-time Super League champions will have feared the worst here when, with half-an-hour remaining, the Rhinos were reduced to 12 men. Leading by just eight points at that stage, the Leeds of as recently as a few weeks ago would have perhaps collapsed. Instead, the manner in which they put a Catalans side harbouring title ambitions this season to the sword underlines the growing belief that relegation here is now highly unlikely. Four points clear of bottom-placed London, with a superior points difference to boot, this \u2013 combined with last week\u2019s 44-0 win at Huddersfield \u2013 looks more like a top side, as opposed to the one that has been struggling all season. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dealing with a side fearful of relegation,\u201d Richard Agar, Leeds\u2019 interim coach, said. But as impressive as Leeds were following Brad Singleton\u2019s dismissal, questions must be asked of how Catalans can produce performances as abject as this. They had clawed back a 16-0 deficit to trail by only eight at half-time, but any hopes of a victory vital for their own play-off hopes evaporated in spectacular fashion when they were handed a man advantage. \u201cIt looked like we were the team who were a man light,\u201d Steve McNamara, the Catalans coach, said. They were outplayed for the opening half-hour, with tries for Ash Handley and Rhyse Martin, coupled with four goals from the back-rower, making it 16-0. Mickael Goudemand\u2019s try helped narrow the gap to eight - but what followed after half-time was spectacular. Leeds had to survive the first 10 minutes of the second half without Konrad Hurrell following a sin-bin, but when Singleton was sent off shortly after he returned, the Rhinos were then under huge pressure. \u201cIt was a moment that galvanised us,\u201d Agar added. Within five minutes of that, they went further ahead when Handley scored his second. As McNamara said, Leeds now looked like the team a man up. Brad Dwyer\u2019s run close to the line then enabled Richie Myler to score, and the scrum-half then claimed his second after his half-back partner, Robert Lui, ghosted through before Lui\u2019s wonderful pass sent Luke Briscoe over in the corner. Leeds Walker; Briscoe, Newman, Hurrell, Handley; Lui, Myler; Seumanufagai, Lunt, Cuthbertson, Ferres, Martin, Merrin. Interchange Donaldson, Singleton, Dwyer, Sutcliffe. Tries Handley 2, Martin, Myler 2, Lui, Briscoe. Goals Martin 10. Catalans Gigot; Mead, Romano, Wiliame, Tierney; Bird, Langi; Bousquet, Da Costa, Simon, Edwards, Whitley, Casty. Try Goudemand.

Kaepernick filed his grievance in October 2017, alleging collusion by NFL owners to keep him out of the league. Kaepernick\u2019s decision to kneel during the national anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice created controversy throughout the country in 2016. While compiling a 28-30 record as the 49ers starting quarterback from 2012-16, Kaepernick led them to a Super Bowl XLVII appearance after the 2012 season. A person close to Kaepernick told the Associated Press on Friday: \u201cColin has always been prepared to compete at the highest level and is in the best shape of his life.\u201d The person spoke anonymously because of the confidential nature of discussions with teams. The Philadelphia Eagles lost backup Nate Sudfeld to a broken left wrist suffered Thursday night, raising speculation the team would be in the market for an experienced quarterback. Sudfeld was scheduled for surgery, but coach Doug Pederson said it\u2019s not a season-ending injury and the team was content with No 3 quarterback Cody Kessler and rookie Clayton Thorson. However, Eagles starting quarterback Carson Wentz has sustained season-ending injuries each of the past two seasons. Nick Foles led Philadelphia to four playoff wins in two years and was 2018 Super Bowl MVP, but signed an $88 million, four-year deal with Jacksonville in free agency. Sudfeld has thrown 25 passes in the NFL. Kessler is 2-10 as a starter in three seasons with Cleveland and Jacksonville. The Ravens considered signing Kaepernick in the summer of 2017 when starting quarterback Joe Flacco was dealing with a back injury that would keep him out for the entire preseason. Owner Steve Bisciotti said he consulted with fans and the team ultimately passed. Kaepernick met with Seattle a couple of years ago, but Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said he should be a starter in the league and the team only wanted a backup for Russell Wilson. Former 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh said he has told teams who\u2019ve asked him about Kaepernick that he\u2019s a \u201cgreat competitor\u201d and he\u2019ll \u201chave a great career and be a great quarterback, win championships\u201d.",

But others would just like the freedom to grieve. \u201cThere are families and real lives that were destroyed and shattered,\u201d Terry said on Friday, her voice hoarse from crying. \u201cAt this time, we need to focus on the healing and the picking up the pieces, and not get thrust into any type of politics. It\u2019s a time to mourn and grieve right now.\u201d Terry\u2019s side of the family chose not to visit with the president and is not commenting on their feelings about the photo or Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cWe chose to stay politically neutral and focus on our healing and focus on the children,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us, it just wasn\u2019t the right time to even address anything of the matter. We just don\u2019t want to be tossed into a political battlefield as we\u2019re trying to pick up the pieces of our lives.\u201d Meanwhile, Deborah Anchondo, Andre Anchondo\u2019s sister, expressed anger on Facebook at local politicians for saying that Trump was not welcome in El Paso. \u201cI lost my brother and sister-in-law on Saturday,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy family and I are living a horrible nightmare. The visit from our President will be more than comforting to my family.\u201d The family did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. Jordan felt that her most important job was motherhood; her family\u2019s task now was to make sure her three kids were taken care of. Days after the shooting, the couple\u2019s five-year-old had started school without her parents, often crying and asking for them, Terry said. The family was preparing for Jordan\u2019s memorial service. \u201cIt will be one of the hardest days of their lives,\u201d Terry said.",

After that first speech on the steps of Downing Street, the prime minister faces an early test, with official figures suggesting the economy is on the cusp of recession. GDP contracted in the three months to June by 0.2%, the first decline in a quarter since 2012 when the nation risked a double-dip recession amid the weak recovery from the financial crisis. Should the economy fail to do anything more than stagnate in the third quarter, a technical recession would be confirmed. Economists reckon there is a one in three chances of such an outcome, even if the UK avoids leaving the EU without a deal. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said it expects growth will likely return in the third quarter. But a lack of positive momentum and recent business surveys suggest output could falter again. Sajid Javid blamed the drop in GDP on challenging conditions in the world economy, and talked up Britain\u2019s resilience. He also argued that Britain would outpace EU rivals such as Germany and Italy this year. Bad news for our biggest trading partners tends to be bad news in Britain, given the high degree of integration in EU supply chains. Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China has served as a handbrake on global growth, sapping business confidence and sinking factory output around the world. However, the unique Brexit headwinds also played a role. Planned factory shutdowns by carmakers around the original 29 March Brexit deadline were behind much of the slump in the second quarter, contributing to the largest quarterly fall in manufacturing for a decade. The sugar rush for the economy from companies stockpiling goods has also faded. Growth had raced ahead to 0.5% in the first quarter as firms bought supplies at the fastest rate on record for a G7 economy. But with reasonably adequate supplies the new orders have dried up, hitting economic output. Finally, the general cloud of Brexit uncertainty has acted as a handbrake on business activity in recent months. Business investment fell by 0.5%, as corporate caution due to the recent political turmoil weighed on spending decisions. The service sector was the only silver lining. Consumers have propped up growth in recent months by tuning out from the Brexit warnings and carrying on shopping. An acceleration in wage growth, stable inflation and record employment has helped. Javid said he was not expecting a recession \u201cat all\u201d for Britain, but the chances have certainly risen sharply.",

A man can put on whatever he wants to get hitched (I suggest a kilt with an accompanying neon sporran) but women have to <em>earn</em> the privilege. Wearing a sheath dress? You\u2019d better be thinking about \u201cexercises that tone your core, hips and legs\u201d \u2013 and not wasting your time thinking about the lifelong union you will be entering, or getting excited about all the memories you will be making.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you\u2019re going for an open-back dress, then you\u2019d better know that nobody cares about you, your beloved, or your carefully curated table plan</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Equally, I hope you\u2019re not spending too much energy on thinking about whether marriage is an institution that can ever truly work for women if you\u2019re planning on going strapless on the day. Because trainer Kit Rich, who was consulted for the article, needs you to know that it\u2019s not worries about the patriarchal structures in our society that will tone up your shoulders and arms. It\u2019s push-ups and a jump-clap, dammit.</p> <p>If you\u2019re going for an open-back dress, then you\u2019d better know that nobody cares about you, your beloved or your carefully curated table plan designed so that your cousin Jack and your mate Nadia will finally hook up. No! Everyone will know that \u201cyour back is the star\u201d, says Laura Posada, another trainer who appears in the piece. It turns out that your back, an area of your body you <em>cannot even see</em>, must be worked and trained.</p> <p>Once you identify which shape of dress you will be shoving your disgustingly normal body into, there\u2019s also diet advice to consider. The article has a cute bit at the beginning about eating right \u201cwhether you want to lose weight or gain weight or you like your self just the way you are\u201d which is almost like the terms and conditions we all click yes to, impatiently, but know will come back and screw us one day. Nobody asking you to consider your underarm shape seriously thinks you like yourself just the way you are.</p> <p>Women cannot win (there\u2019s a sentence for the ages). If we care about our appearance, we\u2019re branded shallow. If we dare to assume that we can throw on any dress we like to get hitched in, someone will tell us we\u2019re deluded.</p> <p>There is one bit of the piece that they nailed: the headline.</p> <p>\u201cGetting married? Get strong\u201d is a solid nugget of advice. If you\u2019re going to enter into a union with another human being, you should be as strong as possible. It\u2019s hard to live with someone day in, day out. It\u2019s hard to compromise, to have enough empathy, to not lose some of yourself. Sometimes it\u2019s really hard to love your partner when they repeatedly wear your neon sporran without asking.</p> <p>Lift weights as much as you want in the run-up to your wedding. But don\u2019t do it because a newspaper tells you to. Journalists are some of the least fit people in the world, and even <em>they</em> manage to get married. Anyway, you don\u2019t need biceps for the wedding \u2013 you need them for the divorce. Mazel tov!</p>",

You\u2019d better be thinking about \u201cexercises that tone your core, hips and legs\u201d \u2013 and not wasting your time thinking about the lifelong union you will be entering, or getting excited about all the memories you will be making. Equally, I hope you\u2019re not spending too much energy on thinking about whether marriage is an institution that can ever truly work for women if you\u2019re planning on going strapless on the day. Because trainer Kit Rich, who was consulted for the article, needs you to know that it\u2019s not worries about the patriarchal structures in our society that will tone up your shoulders and arms. It\u2019s push-ups and a jump-clap, dammit. If you\u2019re going for an open-back dress, then you\u2019d better know that nobody cares about you, your beloved or your carefully curated table plan designed so that your cousin Jack and your mate Nadia will finally hook up. No! Everyone will know that \u201cyour back is the star\u201d, says Laura Posada, another trainer who appears in the piece. It turns out that your back, an area of your body you cannot even see, must be worked and trained. Once you identify which shape of dress you will be shoving your disgustingly normal body into, there\u2019s also diet advice to consider. The article has a cute bit at the beginning about eating right \u201cwhether you want to lose weight or gain weight or you like your self just the way you are\u201d which is almost like the terms and conditions we all click yes to, impatiently, but know will come back and screw us one day. Nobody asking you to consider your underarm shape seriously thinks you like yourself just the way you are. Women cannot win (there\u2019s a sentence for the ages). If we care about our appearance, we\u2019re branded shallow. If we dare to assume that we can throw on any dress we like to get hitched in, someone will tell us we\u2019re deluded. There is one bit of the piece that they nailed: the headline. \u201cGetting married? Get strong\u201d is a solid nugget of advice. If you\u2019re going to enter into a union with another human being, you should be as strong as possible. It\u2019s hard to live with someone day in, day out. It\u2019s hard to compromise, to have enough empathy, to not lose some of yourself. Sometimes it\u2019s really hard to love your partner when they repeatedly wear your neon sporran without asking. Lift weights as much as you want in the run-up to your wedding. But don\u2019t do it because a newspaper tells you to. Journalists are some of the least fit people in the world, and even they manage to get married. Anyway, you don\u2019t need biceps for the wedding \u2013 you need them for the divorce. Mazel tov!",

Next week, Berlin\u2019s administrative court will hear that the decision of the State and Cathedral Choir Berlin (SDB) to reject the girl after an audition in April this year was discriminatory because it infringed on her right to equal opportunities in state support. The girl\u2019s mother, who is bringing forward the complaint on her behalf, argues the choir\u2019s girls-only partner choir at the Berliner Singakademie could not have provided her daughter with training of a similar quality. Founded in 1465 under Frederick II, the elector of Brandenburg, the choir is the German capital\u2019s oldest musical institution, and found international fame in the 19th century under the direction of the Romantic composer Felix Mendelssohn. It currently provides training to approximately 250 choirboys and 75 young men in 11 different choir groups. It has never admitted any females. The directors of the choir, part of Berlin\u2019s University of the Arts (UdK), claim the girl\u2019s rejection was \u201cnot predominantly\u201d about her gender, and say she would have been asked to join if she had displayed extraordinary talent and motivation. Susann Br\u00e4cklein, a lawyer representing the girl and her mother, told the Guardian the choir\u2019s account was questionable, since UdK had put the girl forward for the Julius Stern Institute, an elite school for highly gifted young musicians. Br\u00e4cklein said the SDB\u2019s rejection was \u201cvery strange\u201d and could only be explained by bias against her gender. \u201cExceptional talent does not appear to be an entrance requirement for boys,\u201d she added. The choir\u2019s directors said in a statement issued by the court that boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 choirs sound different for anatomical reasons, and that higher rejection rates for girls were justified on the grounds of artistic freedom. Br\u00e4cklein said experts had dismissed the notion that prepubescent male voices had a unique tonal purity, pointing to a 2002 study by the British academic David Howard \u2013 Gendered Voice in the Cathedral Choir \u2013 which found that most listeners could not tell the difference between choirs of girls and boys singing the same songs. \u201cVoice formation is crucial,\u201d said Br\u00e4cklein. \u201cPractising three times a week can achieve a lot, even with average voices.

The SDB\u2019s website says \u201cboys aged five to seven and older boys with a musical background\u201d are regularly invited to auditions.

We never expected she could possibly be down there,\u201d he said. The disappearance of the 35-year old scientist sparked an unprecedented hunt after her partner reported her missing on Monday when she failed to return from a morning run. The search expanded to land, sea and air as the quest to find Christopher intensified.

      "body": "<p>The family of 12-year-old refugee Shukri Abdi who drowned in June have branded an internal investigation into claims of bullying before her death \u201ca whitewash\u201d.</p> <p>Shukri was found drowned in the River Irwell in the Lancashire town of Bury on 28 June. She came to the UK from Somalia last year with her mother and siblings after fleeing conflict.</p> <p>Members of Shukri\u2019s family claim she was badly bullied at the school, Broad Oak sports college in Bury, for more than a year but that the school failed to respond to her family\u2019s concerns. They accuse the school of failing to take the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/04/girl-who-drowned-in-bury-river-bullied-at-school-say-family\">bullying complaints seriously</a>.</p> <p>The school agreed to conduct an internal investigation into the claims and on Friday afternoon called the family to Bury police station to provide them with the conclusions.</p> <p>Shukri\u2019s uncle Mustaf Omar, 29, said: \u201cWe are not happy with the lack of information in the report. It\u2019s a whitewash. We hoped the school would interview Shukri\u2019s mother for this report and other parents whose children might have experienced bullying but they weren\u2019t approached.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very insulting that we were asked to go to the police station to receive this school report. We asked for an interpreter for Shukri\u2019s mum, Zamzam, but there was no interpreter there. Zamzam just sat there crying. In the end we walked out of the police station in protest about the way we were treated.\u201d</p> <p>The family\u2019s lawyer, Attiq Malik, of Liberty Law Solicitors said: \u201cThe family are very unhappy with this report. Despite assurances from the school that a full review would be carried out this has not been done. The family have lost trust in the police and now they have lost trust in the school too. The family is turning to the community for help. We hope other members of the community who have evidence relating to this case will now come forward.\u201d</p> <p>Shukri\u2019s mother, Zamzam Arab Ture, is calling on the school to be investigated for a potential breach of its duty of care towards pupils.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIf the rights we came to this country for exist I want something done.\u201d</p> <p>Friday\u2019s report was the result of a review of the school\u2019s anti-bullying policy announced by the headteacher of Broad Oak sport college, <a href=\"https://www.broadoak.bury.sch.uk/post/statement-from-mr-greenhalgh\">Paul Greenhalgh</a>, in the wake of Shukri\u2019s death.</p> <p>The Guardian has seen an account from another student at the school who is thought to have been a victim of the same kind of bullying Shukri was subjected to.

      "bodyText": "The family of 12-year-old refugee Shukri Abdi who drowned in June have branded an internal investigation into claims of bullying before her death \u201ca whitewash\u201d. Shukri was found drowned in the River Irwell in the Lancashire town of Bury on 28 June. She came to the UK from Somalia last year with her mother and siblings after fleeing conflict. Members of Shukri\u2019s family claim she was badly bullied at the school, Broad Oak sports college in Bury, for more than a year but that the school failed to respond to her family\u2019s concerns. They accuse the school of failing to take the bullying complaints seriously. The school agreed to conduct an internal investigation into the claims and on Friday afternoon called the family to Bury police station to provide them with the conclusions. Shukri\u2019s uncle Mustaf Omar, 29, said: \u201cWe are not happy with the lack of information in the report. It\u2019s a whitewash. We hoped the school would interview Shukri\u2019s mother for this report and other parents whose children might have experienced bullying but they weren\u2019t approached. \u201cIt was very insulting that we were asked to go to the police station to receive this school report. We asked for an interpreter for Shukri\u2019s mum, Zamzam, but there was no interpreter there. Zamzam just sat there crying. In the end we walked out of the police station in protest about the way we were treated.\u201d The family\u2019s lawyer, Attiq Malik, of Liberty Law Solicitors said: \u201cThe family are very unhappy with this report. Despite assurances from the school that a full review would be carried out this has not been done. The family have lost trust in the police and now they have lost trust in the school too. The family is turning to the community for help. We hope other members of the community who have evidence relating to this case will now come forward.\u201d Shukri\u2019s mother, Zamzam Arab Ture, is calling on the school to be investigated for a potential breach of its duty of care towards pupils. She said: \u201cIf the rights we came to this country for exist I want something done.\u201d Friday\u2019s report was the result of a review of the school\u2019s anti-bullying policy announced by the headteacher of Broad Oak sport college, Paul Greenhalgh, in the wake of Shukri\u2019s death. The Guardian has seen an account from another student at the school who is thought to have been a victim of the same kind of bullying Shukri was subjected to. The girl said her problems had gone on for more than a year, that she had been grabbed and seriously assaulted by another pupil and struggled to cope. She said that although she had reported the bullying to the school nothing had been done and she felt unsupported. The girl\u2019s mother raised concerns about bullying at the school with both the school and police but said that neither had responded appropriately. The mother added that some pupils who were victims of bullying were too scared of reprisals from the bullies to speak out about their experiences. Saynab Hareed, Shukri\u2019s aunt, described the difficulties Shukri had had fitting in and said that teachers would sometimes bring her home themselves from school amid fears for her safety. \u201cShe had been telling us of the bullying for months,\u201d said Hareed. She added that things became so bad at one point that a teacher decided to remove her from school in a desperate attempt to protect her. Shukri\u2019s family said she helped look after her four younger siblings, supported her mother and dreamed of becoming a doctor. An investigation has been launched into whether police treated Shukri\u2019s family \u201cless favourably\u201d because of their ethnic background. On Thursday, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) announced it had begun an investigation after a complaint about police actions following Shukri\u2019s death. An IOPC spokeswoman said: \u201cIn July the force referred a complaint they had received about their actions; it alleged that officers failed to conduct an effective investigation and prematurely concluded that the death of Shukri Abdi was not suspicious.\u201d A separate investigation into her death by Greater Manchester police was continuing. A GMP spokeswoman said: \u201cWe will liaise with the IOPC to ensure that they are provided with any information they need. It would be inappropriate for us to comment any further at this time.\u201d A public meeting has been organised for Saturday by the Justice4Shukri Campaign. Campaigners are calling for an investigation into the numerous complaints of bullying at the school, actions to prevent further tragedies from happening and transparency around the investigation into Shukri\u2019s death. Caroline Bailey, a teacher at Broad Oaks School, took her own life in September 2012 following claims of bullying there. The school has been approached for comment.",

The sessions usually involve Prince emotionally reliving the events of the day his son was murdered in May 2006 in an attempt to illustrate the consequences of carrying a knife and, after spending an hour in his company, it is easy to see why the charity was overwhelmingly chosen ahead of such a good cause as The Grenfell Foundation, situated just around the corner from Loftus Road.</p> <p>\u201cI feel the same as I did when I went through it then,\u201d he says of the talks. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m crying in front of them.

He was just a nice guy. \u201cI think Kiyan represents all those kids that are buried too early and we don\u2019t get to see their potential. We will never know what they would have achieved \u2013 what they could have invented or records they were going to break. There\u2019s treasure there in the ground. My message to kids is to not die full of your gift.\u201d To make a donation to the Kiyan Prince Foundation, visit thekpf.com",

Opponents of no deal reckon defeating Johnson in a vote of noconfidence should stay his hand. But that fails to factor in the shamelessness that could see the prime minister cling on to power long enough to schedule an election for <em>after</em> Britain has crashed out of the EU. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1159780988844675072?s=20\" title=\"\">letter to the cabinet secretary </a>, pleading for him to rule out such a move, relies on an old-world trust in an unwritten constitution that the Brexiters have shown they are all too happy to trash.</p> <p>Above all, remainers hold tightly to the prospect that no deal will be an instant disaster, a catastrophe that strikes the moment the clock chimes midnight. This ignores the unilateral measures the EU has already put in place to ensure that planes land and financial services don\u2019t collapse. Even those already infamous queues of trucks at Dover may not materialise \u2013 not because everything will be fine, but because drivers decide to stay away. \u201cThe economic disruption will still be there,\u201d says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamuelMarcLowe\" title=\"\">Sam Lowe</a>, trade analyst at the Centre for European Reform. \u201cIt just might not be visible.\u201d If pro-Europeans don\u2019t want hardcore Brexiters claiming vindication when the sky fails to fall in on 1 November, they need to manage expectations now, bracing the public not for an explosion but a slow puncture.</p> <p>Still, the greatest myths lie on the other side. One is the fond hope that Britons will weather the disruption of a no-deal Brexit as stoically as they withstood the blitz. The sight of British holidaymakers driven to tears over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/07/british-airways-it-glitch-causes-disruption-for-passengers-delays\" title=\"\">flight delays this week</a>, with its echo of that time Britons called 999 to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MPSTowerHam/status/965951677105917952?s=20\" title=\"\">complain about KFC running out of chicken</a>, should disabuse us of that particular daydream.</p> <p>But it\u2019s a different fantasy that surely explains much of that 38% support for no deal. Put simply, it\u2019s the notion that crashing out of the EU on 31 October will mark a clean break and end the Brexit saga once and for all. You hear versions of this sentiment from voters and politicians, on the left as well as the right, expressed both as sheer fatigue at the whole sorry business and the desire to get on with other things. The assumption is that, if we just hold our nose and jump on Halloween, then we shall return at last to the sort of issues that dominated pre-2016 politics: the NHS, crime, education and austerity. The trouble is, that too is a fantasy.</p> <p>Listen to the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who earlier this week cautioned those who were \u201cweary of Brexit\u201d that, \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Redpolitics/status/1158722025323663365\" title=\"\">This doesn\u2019t end on 31 October</a>.\u201d There might be an instant sense of catharsis, even elation, among leavers on that day, but very soon reality will reassert itself. As Varadkar put it: \u201cIf there is no deal, then at a certain point we will have to begin negotiations again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/09/uk-economy-contracts-on-back-of-brexit-uncertainty\">Recession fears grow as UK economy shrinks on back of Brexit chaos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Doubtless, the hardest of hard Brexiters would dispute that, imagining we could turn our backs on both Ireland and the EU. But there is not a developed country on Earth that hasn\u2019t negotiated some form of preferential trading relationship with its nearest neighbour, especially when the neighbour in question is as comparatively large as the EU is to Britain. So we will be back around that Brussels negotiating table, and the Irish prime minister was right about the first three items on the agenda when we get there. Yep, our old friends: the financial settlement, EU citizens\u2019 rights, and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.</p> <p>That\u2019s right, after a no-deal Brexit, we\u2019d be back where we started. The last three years would come to seem like an argument between a husband and wife that\u2019s raged in the kitchen. After 31 October, as my colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rafaelbehr\" title=\"\">Rafael Behr</a> likes to put it, it\u2019d be the same argument \u2013 except now the husband would be standing on the street, the front door slammed in his face, shouting his demands through the letterbox.</p> <p>EU leaders think that will happen quickly, a desperate Britain seeking talks within a few weeks of crashing out. They may be wrong. The UK government could look westward in an attempt to seal a trade deal with the US, hoping to grab a trophy that might console us for the losses incurred by Brexit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/07/us-uk-trade-deal-mike-pompeo-brexit-dominic-raab\" title=\"\">That could happen fast</a>, if we\u2019re willing to sign here, here and here \u2013 making the NHS vulnerable to the pressures of big pharma and opening our supermarkets to chlorinated chicken. Donald Trump may give us that kind of deal. But even that won\u2019t work. Because trade treaties have to be ratified by the US Congress, and the Democrats who control the House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/31/brexit-mess-with-good-friday-and-well-block-uk-trade-deal-us-politicians-warn\" title=\"\">have already said </a>they won\u2019t endorse any deal that threatens the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland. So guess what: we\u2019re back at the backstop.</p> <p>This is why Lowe is adamant: \u201cBrexit doesn\u2019t end. It just repeats itself.\u201d This is a never-ending story. It\u2019s why journalists working today realise they will be covering Brexit until their last breath. The contours of the argument might change after a no-deal exit \u2013 how bad is it, who\u2019s to blame, should we rejoin the EU? \u2013 but the sides will be much as they are today. Unless we call the whole thing off, this is our future: leave v remain, remain v leave, Brexit for ever and ever.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

But that fails to factor in the shamelessness that could see the prime minister cling on to power long enough to schedule an election for after Britain has crashed out of the EU. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s letter to the cabinet secretary , pleading for him to rule out such a move, relies on an old-world trust in an unwritten constitution that the Brexiters have shown they are all too happy to trash. Above all, remainers hold tightly to the prospect that no deal will be an instant disaster, a catastrophe that strikes the moment the clock chimes midnight. This ignores the unilateral measures the EU has already put in place to ensure that planes land and financial services don\u2019t collapse. Even those already infamous queues of trucks at Dover may not materialise \u2013 not because everything will be fine, but because drivers decide to stay away. \u201cThe economic disruption will still be there,\u201d says Sam Lowe, trade analyst at the Centre for European Reform. \u201cIt just might not be visible.\u201d If pro-Europeans don\u2019t want hardcore Brexiters claiming vindication when the sky fails to fall in on 1 November, they need to manage expectations now, bracing the public not for an explosion but a slow puncture. Still, the greatest myths lie on the other side. One is the fond hope that Britons will weather the disruption of a no-deal Brexit as stoically as they withstood the blitz. The sight of British holidaymakers driven to tears over flight delays this week, with its echo of that time Britons called 999 to complain about KFC running out of chicken, should disabuse us of that particular daydream. But it\u2019s a different fantasy that surely explains much of that 38% support for no deal. Put simply, it\u2019s the notion that crashing out of the EU on 31 October will mark a clean break and end the Brexit saga once and for all. You hear versions of this sentiment from voters and politicians, on the left as well as the right, expressed both as sheer fatigue at the whole sorry business and the desire to get on with other things. The assumption is that, if we just hold our nose and jump on Halloween, then we shall return at last to the sort of issues that dominated pre-2016 politics: the NHS, crime, education and austerity. The trouble is, that too is a fantasy. Listen to the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who earlier this week cautioned those who were \u201cweary of Brexit\u201d that, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t end on 31 October.\u201d There might be an instant sense of catharsis, even elation, among leavers on that day, but very soon reality will reassert itself. As Varadkar put it: \u201cIf there is no deal, then at a certain point we will have to begin negotiations again.\u201d Doubtless, the hardest of hard Brexiters would dispute that, imagining we could turn our backs on both Ireland and the EU. But there is not a developed country on Earth that hasn\u2019t negotiated some form of preferential trading relationship with its nearest neighbour, especially when the neighbour in question is as comparatively large as the EU is to Britain. So we will be back around that Brussels negotiating table, and the Irish prime minister was right about the first three items on the agenda when we get there. Yep, our old friends: the financial settlement, EU citizens\u2019 rights, and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. That\u2019s right, after a no-deal Brexit, we\u2019d be back where we started. The last three years would come to seem like an argument between a husband and wife that\u2019s raged in the kitchen. After 31 October, as my colleague Rafael Behr likes to put it, it\u2019d be the same argument \u2013 except now the husband would be standing on the street, the front door slammed in his face, shouting his demands through the letterbox. EU leaders think that will happen quickly, a desperate Britain seeking talks within a few weeks of crashing out. They may be wrong. The UK government could look westward in an attempt to seal a trade deal with the US, hoping to grab a trophy that might console us for the losses incurred by Brexit. That could happen fast, if we\u2019re willing to sign here, here and here \u2013 making the NHS vulnerable to the pressures of big pharma and opening our supermarkets to chlorinated chicken. Donald Trump may give us that kind of deal. But even that won\u2019t work. Because trade treaties have to be ratified by the US Congress, and the Democrats who control the House have already said they won\u2019t endorse any deal that threatens the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland. So guess what: we\u2019re back at the backstop. This is why Lowe is adamant: \u201cBrexit doesn\u2019t end. It just repeats itself.\u201d This is a never-ending story. It\u2019s why journalists working today realise they will be covering Brexit until their last breath. The contours of the argument might change after a no-deal exit \u2013 how bad is it, who\u2019s to blame, should we rejoin the EU? \u2013 but the sides will be much as they are today. Unless we call the whole thing off, this is our future: leave v remain, remain v leave, Brexit for ever and ever. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

He used to be such a thing.</p> \n<p>Still, the spotlight is fickle. This week it was mostly shining on Dominic Cummings, a sort of skinny Cartman who really wants you to know he\u2019s got the highest score on Call of Duty: SW1. Every photo of Cummings going into Downing Street sees him shiftily meeting the camera\u2019s gaze with the same defensive sneer you\u2019d see on the proprietor of a holiday caravan park who has just been released on police bail after a fatal gas explosion thought to have been caused by poor maintenance. Britain really is the land of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/dominic-cummings-a-career-psychopath-in-downing-street\" title=\"\">crap Rasputins</a>, each one dragging us one step further back towards the primordial soup, like some grim Descent of Man. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/how-steve-hilton-turned-on-his-friend-and-ex-boss-david-cameron\" title=\"\">Hilton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/nick-timothy-and-fiona-hill-unelected-advisers-who-acted-more-like-dpms\" title=\"\">Timothy</a>, Cummings \u2026 What\u2019s the next term in this sequence? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/12/back-in-the-bunker-labour-unease-with-corbyns-cadre-grows\" title=\"\">Milne</a>? Chuckle? Sutcliffe? It could go one of several ways.</p> \n<p>Naturally, Dominic regards himself as rather better than that. To get some idea of the level of pretension we\u2019re dealing with, his former Twitter handle (for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/02/gove-advisers-claims-smear-tactics\" title=\"\">the account he admitted</a> to) was @OdysseanProject. His bio? \u201cPhysicist Gell-Mann said we need an Odyssean education.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cummings still has <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/\" title=\"\">his blog</a>, where he posts 20,000-word \u2026 essays, is it? His is a writing style I call Briar Rose, on account of the requirement to take your sword and hack your way through the densest thicket of impenetrable prose this side of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/21/jordan-peterson-self-help-author-12-steps-interview\" title=\"\">Jordan Peterson</a> integrated theory of his mother. A few thousand words into one of Dominic\u2019s blogs, it is very easy to become disheartened. You find yourself asking: is there an incredibly hot princess of meaning lying asleep in the middle of all these branches of history, or am I basically just doing some lazy castle-owner\u2019s gardening for free?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"324aee18-8dc4-44f1-986f-3d9bad89ab34\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xGLxGx2wDqo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet his attempts to cast himself as Whitehall\u2019s Minotaur have been bizarrely successful. Cummings appears to have been specifically engineered to appeal to that particular media demographic which reckons British politics is just like Westeros. Guys, just because you ejaculate during the title sequence of both Game of Thrones and Politics Live, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the same.</p> \n<p>This week, a lot of people went nuts over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1159003407363035138\" title=\"\">a brief clip</a> of Cummings smirkingly getting into a car saying things like: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m arrogant. I don\u2019t know much.\u201d Pretty sure we\u2019ve heard that one before, albeit in a thick Portuguese accent. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call me arrogant, because what I\u2019m saying is true. I think <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pybQAg2YUxY\" title=\"\">I am a Special One</a>.\u201d </p> \n<p>Maybe that\u2019s why Dominic is putting Boris in the shade. People always used to say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/i-have-the-fire-jose-mourinho-targets-return-to-management\" title=\"\">Jos</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/i-have-the-fire-jose-mourinho-targets-return-to-management\" title=\"\">\u00e9 Mourinho</a> was such a genius for protecting his star players by acting like a maniac himself. I can\u2019t remember whether we were still supposed to think it by the time Mourinho was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COJ0Z42YQDM\" title=\"\">gouging a rival coach\u2019s eye</a>, or whether by that stage it was OK to conclude that Mourinho was simply a complete \u2026 but no. It\u2019s too simple. It must be \u201cmind games\u201d.</p> \n<p>Thus, Cummings is not a rejected <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elrnAl6ygeM\" title=\"\">1990s David Mamet character</a>, but a master strategist who schedules <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/indiscreet-aides-will-be-fired-on-the-spot-dominic-cummings-warns-hrclx50kz\" title=\"\">7.55am meetings</a>. This feels like an even more extreme version of the bit in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie when Maggie Smith\u2019s teacher is summoned to the headmistress\u2019s office at 4.15, and sniffs: \u201cNot four, not 4.30, but 4.15. Hm. She thinks to intimidate me by use of quarter hours?\u201d No doubt Cummings would say that the no-five-minutes-spared look is an important part of his messaging. And the message many of us are getting is: he\u2019s a prick. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/26/murray-gell-mann-nobel-prize-physicist-quarks-dies\" title=\"\">Physicist Gell-Mann</a> said they needed a supercomputer down at Los Alamos that was capable of calculating how much of a prick he is, but they couldn\u2019t even build one, because something something systems and red teams, something something Darpa and the Santa Fe Institute.</p> \n<p>In what would surely be a historic instance of bathos, then, it seems all this high-blown theory might be leading to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/09/no-10-cancels-staff-leave-raising-possibility-of-snap-election\" title=\"\">general election</a> on 1 November, hours after we have left the EU automatically, but hours before the chaos of no deal would properly have kicked in. Michael Gove has even floated the idea of 1 November being a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/08/09/should-government-make-november-1-bank-holiday/\" title=\"\">bank holiday</a>. You can\u2019t have turmoil on the financial markets if the banks are shut, amirite?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/09/national-unity-government-boris-johnson-assault-democracy\">Boris Johnson\u2019s no-deal election plot is an assault on democracy | Owen Jones</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So yes, let\u2019s be hugely encouraged that Johnson\u2019s team is treating the general election at the most critical moment in the UK\u2019s postwar history like a bank heist, where the window of opportunity to steal this thing will be incredibly small. Instead of having to work in the two minutes when the security cameras are pointing the other way, and the security guards are changing over or passing that one blind spot on the ground level, the masterminds need to pull off this job just after Britain has left the EU, but just before the collective bed begins to get shat.</p> \n<p>The main thing is to picture Cummings as the T-shirted Danny Ocean of the left-behind, telling his crew: \u201cI don\u2019t need a sensible Brexit, or a safe Brexit, or even a medicines-first Brexit. I just need 15 perfect hours on polling day. Apr\u00e8s that, le d\u00e9luge.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Hilton, Timothy, Cummings \u2026 What\u2019s the next term in this sequence? Milne? Chuckle? Sutcliffe? It could go one of several ways. Naturally, Dominic regards himself as rather better than that. To get some idea of the level of pretension we\u2019re dealing with, his former Twitter handle (for the account he admitted to) was @OdysseanProject. His bio? \u201cPhysicist Gell-Mann said we need an Odyssean education.\u201d Cummings still has his blog, where he posts 20,000-word \u2026 essays, is it? His is a writing style I call Briar Rose, on account of the requirement to take your sword and hack your way through the densest thicket of impenetrable prose this side of a Jordan Peterson integrated theory of his mother. A few thousand words into one of Dominic\u2019s blogs, it is very easy to become disheartened. You find yourself asking: is there an incredibly hot princess of meaning lying asleep in the middle of all these branches of history, or am I basically just doing some lazy castle-owner\u2019s gardening for free? Yet his attempts to cast himself as Whitehall\u2019s Minotaur have been bizarrely successful. Cummings appears to have been specifically engineered to appeal to that particular media demographic which reckons British politics is just like Westeros. Guys, just because you ejaculate during the title sequence of both Game of Thrones and Politics Live, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the same. This week, a lot of people went nuts over a brief clip of Cummings smirkingly getting into a car saying things like: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m arrogant. I don\u2019t know much.\u201d Pretty sure we\u2019ve heard that one before, albeit in a thick Portuguese accent. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call me arrogant, because what I\u2019m saying is true. I think I am a Special One.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s why Dominic is putting Boris in the shade. People always used to say Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was such a genius for protecting his star players by acting like a maniac himself. I can\u2019t remember whether we were still supposed to think it by the time Mourinho was gouging a rival coach\u2019s eye, or whether by that stage it was OK to conclude that Mourinho was simply a complete \u2026 but no. It\u2019s too simple. It must be \u201cmind games\u201d. Thus, Cummings is not a rejected 1990s David Mamet character, but a master strategist who schedules 7.55am meetings. This feels like an even more extreme version of the bit in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie when Maggie Smith\u2019s teacher is summoned to the headmistress\u2019s office at 4.15, and sniffs: \u201cNot four, not 4.30, but 4.15. Hm. She thinks to intimidate me by use of quarter hours?\u201d No doubt Cummings would say that the no-five-minutes-spared look is an important part of his messaging. And the message many of us are getting is: he\u2019s a prick. Physicist Gell-Mann said they needed a supercomputer down at Los Alamos that was capable of calculating how much of a prick he is, but they couldn\u2019t even build one, because something something systems and red teams, something something Darpa and the Santa Fe Institute. In what would surely be a historic instance of bathos, then, it seems all this high-blown theory might be leading to a general election on 1 November, hours after we have left the EU automatically, but hours before the chaos of no deal would properly have kicked in. Michael Gove has even floated the idea of 1 November being a bank holiday. You can\u2019t have turmoil on the financial markets if the banks are shut, amirite? So yes, let\u2019s be hugely encouraged that Johnson\u2019s team is treating the general election at the most critical moment in the UK\u2019s postwar history like a bank heist, where the window of opportunity to steal this thing will be incredibly small. Instead of having to work in the two minutes when the security cameras are pointing the other way, and the security guards are changing over or passing that one blind spot on the ground level, the masterminds need to pull off this job just after Britain has left the EU, but just before the collective bed begins to get shat. The main thing is to picture Cummings as the T-shirted Danny Ocean of the left-behind, telling his crew: \u201cI don\u2019t need a sensible Brexit, or a safe Brexit, or even a medicines-first Brexit. I just need 15 perfect hours on polling day. Apr\u00e8s that, le d\u00e9luge.\u201d \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

He once used his phone to take a photograph of her performing a sexual act on him, which Moore-Martin was completely unaware of.

He wrote messages on Moore-Martin\u2019s mirrors at home, which were biblical in nature, telling her to leave her house to Field.

Farquhar feared he might have dementia, while his friends feared he had become an alcoholic. Field admitted to moving things around in the lecturer\u2019s home to make him believe he was losing his sanity. The anguish had driven Farquhar to thoughts of suicide. When that failed, prosecutors argued that Field killed him and made it look like he had drunk himself to death. Field then collected his inheritance: \u00a320,000 and a life interest in Farquhar\u2019s property. Field moved on to his next victim, Farquhar\u2019s neighbour 82-year-old Ann Moore-Martin, a retired headmistress who was described by friends as \u201cloving, kind and affectionate\u201d. Like Farquhar, she was unmarried and had no children. The jury was told she was \u201cfundamentally lonely\u201d. Field sent notes, letters and poems to Moore-Martin. In one letter sent to Moore-Martin in 2017, Field wrote: \u201cI have not said, as perhaps I should, that I desire you, and desire to woo you; that my earnest hope is that you would see me as I see you: I see you as a beautiful, fun, lovely, insightful woman of faith and grace.\u201d Field moved in with Moore-Martin and they began a sexual relationship. He once used his phone to take a photograph of her performing a sexual act on him, which Moore-Martin was completely unaware of. During his testimony, Field told the jury he thought the photograph could be used as something to blackmail her with if he needed to. Field admitted to embarking on a campaign of gaslighting to disorientate Moore-Martin and get her to question her sanity. He wrote messages on Moore-Martin\u2019s mirrors at home, which were biblical in nature, telling her to leave her house to Field. Moore-Martin, a deeply committed Roman Catholic, did so because she believed she was receiving messages from God. \u201cThe mirror writing was all fake, the relationship was all fake and done with gain in mind,\u201d Field told the jury. \u201cI have deceived absolutely everybody that I have any kind of relationship with.\u201d During the trial, Field admitted he had an \u201cinterest with the extremes of death and the idea of killing\u201d and collected books and essays about dying, including the Five Last Acts, Easing The Passing and The Savage God. Field listed options for how to kill Moore-Martin in one of his notebooks, such as: \u201cHeart attack \u2013 electrical device, dehydration, stair, sex?, in the bath? \u2026 OD on her prescriptions \u2026 church tower \u2026 sleep apnoea.\u201d Moore-Martin would eventually change her will. She became ill and suffered a seizure in February 2017. While she was in hospital, Moore-Martin told her niece about her relationship with Field and the writing on the mirrors. The police then launched an investigation. Moore-Martin changed her will back to benefit her family and died of natural causes in a care home in May 2017. The police investigation resulted in Field being charged with murder, fraud, conspiracy to murder, and attempted murder. He was charged alongside the man he made the bold claim to in a police van, Martyn Smith, a 32-year-old magician. While Field was found guilty of murdering Farquhar, he was cleared of a charge of conspiracy to murder and also acquitted of attempted murder relating to Moore-Martin. Smith was found not guilty of murdering Farquhar and cleared of a charge of conspiracy to murder Moore-Martin.",

With many pundits predict an autumn poll, here is a list of reasons why that might happen. And one why it might not.</p> <h2>Advisers\u2019 leave cancelled</h2> <p>No 10 feels very much on an election footing. No sooner are they finding their feet in their new departments than ministerial special advisers, or \u201cspads\u201d, non-civil service appointees whose careers are tied to those of their minister, have suddenly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/09/no-10-cancels-staff-leave-raising-possibility-of-snap-election\">been told to cancel any holiday plans</a>. An email from Boris Johnson\u2019s own senior adviser, Edward Lister, warned spads that, barring exceptions and pre-booked cases, no holiday time would be allowed before the Brexit day of 31 October.</p> <h2>A stream of policy announcements</h2> <p>He might have been prime minister for little more than a fortnight, but Johnson and his team have already pushed out a series of election-friendly policy announcements, from more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/30/boris-johnson-promises-will-police-hiring-spree-make-streets-safer\">police</a> to a cash boost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/02/disadvantaged-schools-will-gain-least-from-new-tory-funding\">for schools</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/05/nhs-to-get-extra-18bn-even-under-no-deal-brexit-says-hancock\">the NHS</a>. On Thursday, Johnson even used an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/aug/08/boris-johnson-makes-policy-announcement-at-his-desk-via-facebook-live-video\">election-style Facebook address</a> to the nation from his No 10 office to unveil a plan to ease immigration rules for scientists post-Brexit.</p> <h2>A one-year funding settlement</h2> <p>Adding to the sense of clearing the decks before an election, it has emerged that the government is to ditch the planned three-year spending review and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/08/government-to-fast-track-spending-review-to-deliver-pms-pledges\">rush through a one-year version</a> next month, setting out how the spending pledges will be paid for. This would head off accusations that Johnson\u2019s promises were un-costed.</p> <h2>MPs are on alert</h2> <p>For most MPs, recess in August is either about catching up on constituency casework or spending a couple of weeks on the beach. But many are instead busy preparing election machinery, even trailing the streets to knock on doors and talk to constituents. Others are plotting ways to undermine Johnson\u2019s apparent ambition to remove the UK from the EU without a deal on 31 October.</p> <h2>It could be the only way to stop a no-deal Brexit</h2> <p>While there are grandiose plans being made by some MPs to seek to block a no-deal departure, for example by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/new-rebel-bid-to-halt-no-deal-brexit-amid-fury-at-pms-enforcer\">amending the motion</a> needed for parliament to break for party conferences in mid-September, or by amassing some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/05/government-national-unity-no-deal-margaret-beckett-referendum\">government of national unity</a>, more likely would seem to be a Labour-led vote of no confidence against the government. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA), if no new administration can be formed within 14 days of such a vote being successful, an election would happen \u2013 though perhaps falling after Brexit day.</p> <h2>The Commons arithmetic is against Johnson</h2> <p>After the Conservatives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/brecon-radnorshire-byelection-lib-dems-jane-dodds-win-cuts-johnson-commons-majority-to-one\">lost the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection</a> to the Liberal Democrats at the start of the month, the government\u2019s working majority fell to just one. With rumours swirling that several disaffected Tory moderates could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/boris-johnson-warned-he-could-lose-control-of-parliament\">be on the verge of quitting</a>, even this could evaporate by autumn. And even if there was no vote of no confidence, leading a minority government is hugely difficult and Johnson could be tempted to seek a more secure mandate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"efb7bdd0-68cd-42ac-97bd-926f21da1800\"         data-atom-type=\"timeline\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <h2>Why might it not happen?</h2> <p>The arithmetic for a vote of no confidence looks incredibly tight \u2013 as well as needing virtually all opposition MPs to back the measure, it would require several Tories to vote to bring down their own government, which is a big ask. If it looks shaky, Labour might delay and try other methods to stop no deal. Johnson himself could call an election under the FTPA if two-thirds of MPs support the move. But it would be a big risk \u2013 an election amid the uncertain chaos of no deal, banking on the hope that the core pro-Brexit vote would all go to the Conservatives while the remain-minded supporters would fragment. Theresa May tried a similar tactic in 2017, and we all know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jun/08/live-uk-election-results-in-full-2017\">how that ended</a>.</p>",

An email from Boris Johnson\u2019s own senior adviser, Edward Lister, warned spads that, barring exceptions and pre-booked cases, no holiday time would be allowed before the Brexit day of 31 October. A stream of policy announcements He might have been prime minister for little more than a fortnight, but Johnson and his team have already pushed out a series of election-friendly policy announcements, from more police to a cash boost for schools and the NHS. On Thursday, Johnson even used an election-style Facebook address to the nation from his No 10 office to unveil a plan to ease immigration rules for scientists post-Brexit. A one-year funding settlement Adding to the sense of clearing the decks before an election, it has emerged that the government is to ditch the planned three-year spending review and rush through a one-year version next month, setting out how the spending pledges will be paid for. This would head off accusations that Johnson\u2019s promises were un-costed. MPs are on alert For most MPs, recess in August is either about catching up on constituency casework or spending a couple of weeks on the beach. But many are instead busy preparing election machinery, even trailing the streets to knock on doors and talk to constituents. Others are plotting ways to undermine Johnson\u2019s apparent ambition to remove the UK from the EU without a deal on 31 October. It could be the only way to stop a no-deal Brexit While there are grandiose plans being made by some MPs to seek to block a no-deal departure, for example by amending the motion needed for parliament to break for party conferences in mid-September, or by amassing some government of national unity, more likely would seem to be a Labour-led vote of no confidence against the government. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA), if no new administration can be formed within 14 days of such a vote being successful, an election would happen \u2013 though perhaps falling after Brexit day. The Commons arithmetic is against Johnson After the Conservatives lost the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection to the Liberal Democrats at the start of the month, the government\u2019s working majority fell to just one. With rumours swirling that several disaffected Tory moderates could be on the verge of quitting, even this could evaporate by autumn. And even if there was no vote of no confidence, leading a minority government is hugely difficult and Johnson could be tempted to seek a more secure mandate. Why might it not happen? The arithmetic for a vote of no confidence looks incredibly tight \u2013 as well as needing virtually all opposition MPs to back the measure, it would require several Tories to vote to bring down their own government, which is a big ask. If it looks shaky, Labour might delay and try other methods to stop no deal. Johnson himself could call an election under the FTPA if two-thirds of MPs support the move. But it would be a big risk \u2013 an election amid the uncertain chaos of no deal, banking on the hope that the core pro-Brexit vote would all go to the Conservatives while the remain-minded supporters would fragment. Theresa May tried a similar tactic in 2017, and we all know how that ended.",

It is understood that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has agreed to substantially increase support to bidders for British Steel, which employs more than 4,000 people, after months of wrangling following the company\u2019s collapse into administration. The rescue package will include beefed-up grants, indemnities and loans that could be worth as much as \u00a3300m, according to sources quoted by Sky News. A Turkish pension fund is considered to be the frontrunner to takeover the company\u2019s main plant in Scunthorpe and subsidiaries across Teesside, although a consortium which includes a leading civil engineering firm working in west Africa is also in the running after making a late bid. Despite the late interest from elsewhere, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, is expected to approve exclusive talks with Ataer Holdings, a subsidiary of the Turkish military pension scheme Oyak.

Ataer is believed to be the frontrunner after it committed to keeping all parts of the steel company together. While the plant in Scunthorpe makes up the vast majority of British Steel\u2019s operations, the government has so far expressed a preference for selling the company as a single entity, including satellite operations in areas such as Teesside. The government has already provided a \u00a3120m loan to British Steel to help meet its obligations under an EU carbon credits scheme for industrial polluters. Nevertheless, the firm is understood to be losing \u00a35m a week. The Guardian has approached EY and BEIS for comment. Earlier this week, BEIS said: \u201cThis government will leave no stone unturned to get a good solution for British Steel at Scunthorpe, Skinningrove and on Teesside.\u201d If discussions with Ataer break down, three bidders are waiting in the wings: Liberty House, led by Indian-born metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta; Greybull Capital, the investment group which owned British Steel when it collapsed; and the west African consortium led by an as-yet unnamed civil engineering firm. While not revealing its identity, the firm said it would not require any government assistance or grants, unlike some of the rival bids. \u201cThe consortium is working on a long-term massive infrastructure project in west Africa,\u201d said a source close to the company, which has masked its identity. \u201cThe successful purchase of the Scunthorpe site would mean an export opportunity of steel to this project \u2013 with immediate effect. \u201cThe project has an estimated 10-year delivery timescale and has multiple related additional export opportunities for British steel to the region.\u201d Oyak pension fund\u2019s experience in the steel industry stems from its shareholding in the Turkish steelmaker Erdemir. Liberty House would prefer to convert the Scunthorpe works from a blast furnace plant, which makes steel from scratch. It seeks government loan guarantees to replace the blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces, which would be used to make products by recycling scrap steel. Greybull Capital is understood to be interested in picking up parts of the business if the government\u2019s preference for selling the whole business fails to materialise.

You know a heck of a lot more about Watford than I do, how optimistic are you about their chances?</p> <p>Thanks for asking! I am optimistic, though I think the clubs that Watford competed with last season, particularly Everton and Leicester, have also strengthened and some might be out of reach this year. Welbeck and Sarr should significantly improve their goal threat, Dawson should improve the defence, and they are still strong in central midfield. Gracia might have to show a bit more tactical flexibility this year, but he has the personnel to do so. Looking at the 20 teams in the division I would be surprised if Watford are in the bottom five, and with a fair wind they should be aiming for a first top-half finish since the 80s. It is a shame that it took them so long to conclude the deal for Sarr, which caused some uncertainty, though given his participation in the African Cup of Nations even if he had signed in June he would only have turned up this week.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4d58048f084f687f3538b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-09T11:26:20.723Z\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s an interesting list </strong>of the transfer records for footballers by age.

The top two went toe to toe, but the gap to third-placed Chelsea was a startling 25 points. Seventh-placed Wolves ended up 41 points behind the champions. A genuine title race should be evidence of shared strength, of a system able to produce equivalent champion contenders from its own resources. Last year was thrilling. But it was also a bit of a fluke, a rare coincidence of two best-of-generation teams in the same season.</p> <p>It might seem odd to be alarmed by excellence. City\u2019s champion brilliance, and Liverpool\u2019s ability to match them stride for stride, have been marvels of the club football age. Both teams produce passages of football to match or exceed the best of recent times. But it is a challenge every team outside that elite pocket must strive to meet.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s about it for today. Just under three hours until this thing gets real. Thanks for joining us. Bye! It\u2019s Heavy metal v Rock\u2018n\u2019roll as Liverpool kick off the Premier League season against Norwich this evening. Paul Doyle explains in the latest edition of The Fiver. Brendan Rodgers revealed in his press conference that Leicester were priced out of the market as they attempted to replace \u00a380m departure Harry Maguire. The numbers are crazy but relative. Rodgers was quoted \u00a375m for Bournemouth\u2019s Nathan Ake and expected to be able to buy two James Tarkowskis and still have change in his pocket but not when Burnley wanted well in excess of \u00a340m. It was always going to be a difficult market if we were interested in one or two other players but the club started to prepare for that a year ago. They brought in two outstanding centre-backs in Caglar (Soyuncu) and Filip (Benkovic) and if we weren\u2019t to bring anyone else in we know we had them - along with Jonny Evans and Wes Morgan. We looked but the market proved too difficult. But we were comfortable with what we had. For the first time since 2010, Tottenham will start a league season with a home match. But here\u2019s a warning: Aston Villa have won their last three Premier League openers - and all were away from home. Here\u2019s a preview: This might make a good infographic (on a slow day) - Gareth Southgate\u2019s hectic weekend schedule. Here it is in full detail as the England manager prefers to see the action for himself thankyou very much rather that watch it on Match Of The Day: Friday: Liverpool v Norwich Saturday: West Ham v Manchester City Saturday: Tottenham v Aston Villa Sunday: Manchester United v Chelsea England have Euro 2020 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Kosovo next month so time to cast a beady eye. That second-half hat-trick against Ajax was always going to be money in the bank. Yes, Spurs have signed up Lucas Moura until 2024 as they reveal (in soft focus) here. Lovely intro music too from what is presumably a Brazilian Tony Hatch. David Luiz to Arsenal caused furrowed brows and, to be honest, outright laughter from many quarters. But Barney Ronay argues that English football has it all wrong. The Brazilian is, in fact, a smart signing. We mock David Luiz because his failures are so often spectacularly cinematic. Against Spurs at Wembley last year he didn\u2019t just fail to tackle Son Heung-min, he dematerialised completely and winked back into existence doing something different on the other side of the pitch, breakdancing, cooking an omelette, rewiring a plug. We mock David Luiz because when he makes these mistakes he looks so sad and noble in the TV close-up reaction shots, like a plucky orphan child in a Disney adventure whose best friend is a streetwise duck. Meanwhile beyond all this the real David Luiz has made two errors leading directly to a goal in his entire Premier League career. Last season 93 defenders were dispossessed more often than the league\u2019s top-ranked goofball. Only two made more passes. Time for another match preview. This time we\u2019ll take you to Turf Moor for one of Saturday\u2019s four 3pm kick-offs. Poor planning, if we\u2019re being honest ... A surprising move in Europe where Shinji Kagawa has joined Real Zaragoza, who play in the second tier of Spanish football. Japan international Kagawa, who scored 41 times in 148 Bundesliga games during two spells at the club, spent time on loan at Besiktas last season. Rangers have signed Droylsden\u2019s finest Brandon Barker from Manchester City. The Tameside-born winger told told RangersTV: \u201cIt\u2019s a massive club. The name speaks for itself. The people working here obviously had a massive influence on that. I\u2019m here to develop myself and there\u2019s no place to get better than at Rangers Football Club.\u201d Eddie Howe will reserve judgment on his new summer signings until they have played for him in the Premier League. Howe said about new recruits: Lloyd Kelly, Jack Stacey, Philip Billing, Arnaut Danjuma and Harry Wilson As we sit here now, it doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s going to be proved in the games we have to come throughout the season. We hope the players we have signed do really well for us and we wish the players we have let go all the best in their future careers. But let\u2019s wait and see. As a manager, I don\u2019t think you ever totally get what you want. I think there are always things that maybe escaped us or got away from us. But, in the main, we were well backed and well supported. Simon has departed, so here is someone else to run you through the rest of the day\u2019s football stuff. Here is a match preview to get you going. What links Micky Quinn with Didier Drogba? One was an excellent, destructive striker of enormous technical qualities while the other was a Bob Carolgees impersonator in a football kit, but both were members of a very select club. Here\u2019s Richard Foster with more: Hang on, what happened to \u201cMr Happy Plus\u201d, aka Mauricio Pochettino? He\u2019s turned grumpy again, having this to say on the Premier League\u2019s early transfer shutdown, fearing that European clubs could still wade into White Hart Lane waving a massive chequebook and \u201cmake a mess\u201d of his carefully-hatched plans: That is another point to argue that we are at a disadvantage with European clubs because they have 20 days more, because I think it is a big mistake for the Premier League to allow that. In this situation we open the door for clubs in Europe to try and create confusion in the club. The Premier League cannot give this advantage to European clubs because we are going to compete with them. If you are not going to compete with these clubs in the Champions League then OK, but competing with European clubs, it\u2019s a big advantage to them. They can create a mess in a club like us. Our match previews are starting to arrive. Here\u2019s one on Sheffield United\u2019s top-flight return: \u201cCan\u2019t help but feel OGS is on a hiding to nothing with the press,\u201d writes James Kelly. \u201cSo much was made last year of Jose\u2019s griping with the board and general all round demeanour. Despite not being backed in the market he was seen as, and was as it turned out, the main issue by the press. Yet when Ole refuses to castigate the board, moan and whinge we have articles bemoaning the lack of moaning on his part. There would have been nothing he could say today that would appease everyone. No we\u2019re not happy as a fan base with the transfer window. The whole country knows the board are at fault. You don\u2019t need him to say it. So how\u2019s about cutting him some slack until there a few results on the board?\u201d Seems a fair point, though slack really isn\u2019t cut for many United managers. Sid Lowe has profiled Rodri, Manchester City\u2019s rather excellent new defensive midfielder. Here\u2019s a sample quote from Albert Celades, who gave the player his debut with Spain\u2019s Under-21s: For someone of his size he is very quick with both feet, making him able to bring the ball out when under pressure. He does difficult things with simplicity. Like Busquets, he has that intuition that allows him to be well-positioned, to know where a move is going so he\u2019s there to take the ball. Much more here: Daniel Taylor was at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s press conference, and this is what he had to say about it: To listen to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r sitting before a larger than usual audience to preview Manchester United\u2019s season was to witness a man who conspicuously did not want to say anything that could add to the sense \u2013 once again \u2013 that the club could have had a much more productive summer. Solskj\u00e6r wanted to make the point that the negativity swirling around Old Trafford was not shared by himself or his colleagues. Every question was seen as a potential trap. He even declared he had no problem whatsoever with Romelu Lukaku despite the striker effectively abandoning all sense of duty to train with Anderlecht before finalising his move to Internazionale. Was he disappointed with what had happened? Solskj\u00e6r smiled and answered the question, choosing his words very carefully, in a way that did not really answer the question. Much more here: Meanwhile at Crystal Palace, Wilfried Zaha trained as usual today and will be considered for selection this weekend. Here\u2019s Roy Hodgson on his star forward: [His approach is] pretty much as I expected he would be. The fact is, he\u2019s a professional, and he\u2019s committed to the club, to helping us do what we need to do to stay in the league. I can\u2019t say to you that he\u2019s jubilant. I can\u2019t say he\u2019s delighted with the situation, because it\u2019s not the outcome he wanted. The outcome he wanted was to be sold, we didn\u2019t want that and in particular my coaching staff and the players wanted him here with us. For us it\u2019s been a very good outcome because Wilfried\u2019s still with us and we\u2019re looking forward to once again benefiting from the skills he brings to us. Just in! Here\u2019s Frank Lampard on David Luiz\u2019s move away from Chelsea: David\u2019s obviously left. We\u2019d had some conversations over the last week, honest conversations because I know David well, and I think the conclusion of that was that he moved on. It\u2019s an area of the pitch where I have competition, and people will be needing to make that shirt their own. I don\u2019t have ones and twos and threes, I have people competing for the position. I don\u2019t have it set in my mind. He\u2019s moved on. I and everyone at the club wish him the best, because he\u2019s been part of some really good things in our recent history, and now he moves on to play elsewhere. In terms of fallouts, no. There were honest conversations. As a player I always expected honesty from a manager, whatever the news, and I think I got that back from David, hence why he ends up moving to Arsenal. The day David didn\u2019t train it was a decision I made because we were in the middle of this, and it was quite clear which way it was going, but it was not a strike or a punishment or being ostracised, it was just a decision for that day. Pep Guardiola\u2019s press conference has happened. A couple of headlines: Leroy Sane\u2019s injury will keep him out for six to eight months. He should be back sometime between January and March. David Silva has been named captain after a vote among the players. Fernandino, Kevin de Bruyne and Sergio Aguero are his roving assistants. Kyle Walker remains the first-choice right-back, but with new red-hot competition. Riyad Mahrez is free to play having been left out of the squad for the Community Shield because of fears he might fail a doping test. Who is the most positive person in football? It\u2019s hard to say, I think. Sometimes everybody just seems so vexed. You feel like reaching through the screen, slapping them around the chops and shouting, \u201cCheer up, it\u2019s only a game! Look, thousands of people are here supporting/jeering at you, and when the final whistle blows you\u2019ll have a shower, get dressed and go back to your bespoke mansion. Just relax, man!\u201d Anyway, I digress. Here\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino on Tottenham\u2019s transfer business: I am very happy, like I told you before I was happy with my squad and now to add some more players. You are always thinking that players can bring good energy and help us achieve all that we want. We will see what happens, but I am so happy with the way the squad. I was happy before, I am happy plus. I am a happy man. So, there\u2019s your answer. How are Wolves going to go this year? They certainly haven\u2019t taken a step back, keeping all the players who powered them to seventh place last season and bringing in a couple of smart additions, but there is the burden of Europa League football to cope with. Anyway, over to Paul Doyle: Sheffield United\u2019s Chris Wilder has talked about his club\u2019s summer transfer activity. For what it\u2019s worth I think they\u2019ve recruited pretty well, making signings that could provide a basis for a long-term stay in the top flight or make them very serious promotion contenders if they fail to stay up this year: We at a different level to every Premier League club. We can\u2019t go and buy somebody from Everton, or even if we did then we couldn\u2019t afford his wages. You look at players in the Premier League, a lot of them started off in the Championship - or they started somewhere else. Harry Maguire, the world\u2019s most expensive centre-half, started off with Sheffield United in League One. He\u2019s an England international and played for England at the World Cup. So everyone has to start somewhere. Phil Jagielka is another who started off with us and played over a decade in the Premier League at Everton. Look at Jamie Vardy [alright point made - ed] I\u2019m quite happy buying players from the Championship. I looked at the market that we\u2019re in, the attitude of the players and how that fits into how we want to play. We will try to do our best with them and try to make them into better players. They understand they\u2019re not the finished article but have they got the desire and ambition, added to the quality, to go and make a name for themselves - to become a Harry Maguire? It\u2019s up to them now really and we will give them as much help as we possibly can. \u201cOf all the teams in the Premier League, Watford are the team I have the hardest time fitting into a mould,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cI\u2019d neither be surprised if they\u2019d be at risk of relegation, nor if they challenged for Europe. Isma\u00efla Sarr is a player that has impressed every time I\u2019ve seen him, and at least on paper a Sarr-Deloufeu-Welbeck attack could trouble anyone, either as an attacking trident or behind Deeney. You know a heck of a lot more about Watford than I do, how optimistic are you about their chances? Thanks for asking! I am optimistic, though I think the clubs that Watford competed with last season, particularly Everton and Leicester, have also strengthened and some might be out of reach this year. Welbeck and Sarr should significantly improve their goal threat, Dawson should improve the defence, and they are still strong in central midfield. Gracia might have to show a bit more tactical flexibility this year, but he has the personnel to do so. Looking at the 20 teams in the division I would be surprised if Watford are in the bottom five, and with a fair wind they should be aiming for a first top-half finish since the 80s. It is a shame that it took them so long to conclude the deal for Sarr, which caused some uncertainty, though given his participation in the African Cup of Nations even if he had signed in June he would only have turned up this week. Here\u2019s an interesting list of the transfer records for footballers by age. Gabriel Batistuta remains the most expensive 31-year-old of all time, nearly two decades after his move from Fiorentina to Roma. Here\u2019s Barney Ronay looking ahead to the new Premier League season: Last season\u2019s title race was, of course, something of a chimera. The top two went toe to toe, but the gap to third-placed Chelsea was a startling 25 points. Seventh-placed Wolves ended up 41 points behind the champions. A genuine title race should be evidence of shared strength, of a system able to produce equivalent champion contenders from its own resources. Last year was thrilling. But it was also a bit of a fluke, a rare coincidence of two best-of-generation teams in the same season. It might seem odd to be alarmed by excellence. City\u2019s champion brilliance, and Liverpool\u2019s ability to match them stride for stride, have been marvels of the club football age. Both teams produce passages of football to match or exceed the best of recent times. But it is a challenge every team outside that elite pocket must strive to meet. The good health of the league relies on genuine competitiveness. Amen to that. Anyway, much more here: Marco Silva has delivered his assessment of Everton\u2019s transfer window, after feeding a few 10p pieces into the early-excuse generator. In brief: \u201cnot the best\u201d ... \u201cit is what it is\u201d ... \u201cwe always want more\u201d. I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s not the best scenario for me as a coach. We have our targets, not just one or two players, there are more targets which for many reasons we didn\u2019t achieve. It\u2019s not the best scenario to start just with three defenders but it is what it is and we have to manage the situation in the best way. But when you plan one window, our targets are always to improve the squad, to give me better solutions. At the moment our squad is deeper than the last season. We are happy, we always want more but we are happy with what we did. Daniel Harris has written a good piece about Manchester United\u2019s summer. In brief: unhappy. A press release lands in my inbox! \u201cThe Premier League will see 1,073 goals scored, 50 red cards brandished and seven managers leave their posts this season, according to betting firm Sporting Index,\u201d it trills. So there you go. Apparently Harry Kane will win the golden boot. There\u2019s no need to actually watch it now, which is handy as it will free up my Saturday afternoons no end. Breaking news: Huddersfield Town have been charged with misconduct, the FA believing that the kit worn during a pre-season friendly against Rochdale was in breach of FA Regulation C.2(i). You may remember that this kit featured an absolutely massive logo of the club\u2019s sponsor, also a bookmaker, and whipped up a storm of publicity, followed by another round when they revealed that Huddersfield\u2019s actual match kit would not have a sponsor on it at all. I would put a photo of the kit in question here to remind you, though that was surely the sponsor\u2019s intention when cooking up the entire ruse and I\u2019m not minded to play ball because I\u2019m a bit awkward. The FA are clear that \u201cdisciplinary action in accordance with the Rules may be taken against a Club, Player, Club Official or Match Official for any breach of these regulations,\u201d but do not make clear what form any punishment would take. Anyway, here\u2019s the relevant regulation: The following Advertising is permitted: (i) Playing kit (a) On the Clothing of a Player on the field of play, the following areas shall be permitted to be used for Advertising One single area not exceeding 250 square centimetres on the front of the shirt (see Fig 10); One single area not exceeding 100 square centimetres on the back of the shirt (see Fig 13); One single area not exceeding 100 square centimetres on each sleeve of the shirt, between the shoulder seam and the elbow (provided Affiliated Association or Competition Rules so permit) (see Fig 12); One single area not exceeding 100 square centimetres on the back of the shorts (see Fig 14); and Once only on each sock tie-up providing it does not exceed an area of 100 square centimetres (see Fig 11). One or more company may be advertised and, in respect of any one company, one or more of its products. The same Advertising must appear in the same form on the Clothing of all Players and Club Officials, wherever such Advertising appears, throughout the entirety of the match. The transfer window closed yesterday afternoon, but Southampton had to wait until this morning before announcing their last deal, after their move for Augsberg\u2019s Kevin Danso finally received international clearance. The 20-year-old Austrian international was trained in MK Dons\u2019 academy before moving to Augsberg five years ago. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl says: He fits the profile of player that we want to bring here to Southampton. He is in the early part of his career, but he has good experience already, with a lot of existing qualities and the potential to develop even further. We have made some good additions in our attack during the transfer window, with Ch\u00e9 Adams and Moussa Djenepo, and, like them, Kevin is another signing that fits our model of being a talented, young player who adds quality to our first-team squad. He will improve our defensive options, so this is an excellent way for us to finish our business. The Church of England\u2019s gambling spokesman has piped up on Wayne Rooney\u2019s imminent arrival at Derby, where he will wear a shirt number that handily doubles as an advert for the club\u2019s shirt sponsor, a bookmaker: Rooney should take the lead and stand up for his fans by refusing to wear this shirt. If young footballers see a national treasure refusing to sully his personal brand and taking a moral stand it will better protect families from gambling-related harm both now and in the future. Yeah, but money. Nuno Espirito Santo has revealed the reason why Adama Traore missed last night\u2019s Europa League qualifier in Armenia, when Wolves beat Pyunik 4-0: he left his passport at home, thinking an ID card would be enough to get him on the plane. \u201cHe had a problem with his passport ... he didn\u2019t know it\u2019s impossible to travel with an ID card so he couldn\u2019t travel with us.\u201d Steve Bruce has given his pre-match press conference, ahead of Newcastle\u2019s game against Arsenal on Sunday, and was asked about Andy Carroll\u2019s arrival: It was just a conversation with Andy. He was desperate - a bit like myself, I suppose - to come back, and of course the big question mark of everybody is can we get him back quickly and can he stay fit? If he stays fit, then a fit Andy Carroll is as good as you\u2019re going to get. We\u2019ll do our utmost. He is determined to come and be successful again here. It\u2019s his home-town club - it was a no-brainer, really, one of those where you\u2019re delighted to do it. And here\u2019s a West Ham season preview. Only one to go! Here are today\u2019s freshest and hottest transfer rumours, featuring Wilfried Zaha\u2019s medium-term future and Neymar\u2019s big deadline: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has just given his Friday press conference. Here\u2019s a snippet: I think when the transfer window closes it\u2019s a great feeling of relief. Now it\u2019s done, we know what we\u2019re looking forward with and I\u2019m delighted with the players we\u2019ve signed. That\u2019s not the feeling inside the club, and that\u2019s not the feeling with the fans I\u2019ve met. They\u2019re excited with the ones we\u2019ve got. Of course there\u2019ll always be fans out there wanting to sign players. The players are here now, they\u2019ve been shown that trust and we believe in them. Breaking news: Ilkay Gundogan signs three-year contract extension at Manchester City Ilkay Gundogan has signed a new three-year contract extension with Manchester City, the Premier League champions have announced. The German midfielder, who had just entered the final year of his previous deal, is now committed to the club until 2023. The news ends speculation over the future of the 28-year-old, who joined City from Borussia Dortmund in 2016. Gundogan told the club\u2019s website: \u201cI am very happy to have signed the new contract. I have hugely enjoyed the last three years here at City and everyone at the club has helped make me feel at home from my very first day. It\u2019s a privilege to be a part of this team, playing the style of football we do and winning trophies. It\u2019s very difficult to do that and I\u2019m delighted to be a part of it. I\u2019m really excited about what we can go on to achieve in the next few seasons.\u201d Gundogan\u2019s first season at City was cut short by a serious knee injury but he has been a key part of the club\u2019s back-to-back Premier League triumphs over the past two campaigns. Their drector of football, Txiki Begiristain, said: \u201cIlkay\u2019s new deal is more excellent news for our club. He has shown how important he is to the team and has played a huge part in everything that we have achieved so far. We are thrilled he has committed his long-term future to Manchester City.\u201d Hello world! It\u2019s the big kick-off! The Premier League season gets under way tonight in a kick-off even bigger than this one: So there\u2019ll be team news and press conference-based updates, as well as the continued fall-out from the freshly-closed domestic transfer window and whatever other wild excitement is being tossed around the world of football like so feathers in a hurricane.

Ross was an early backer of Chang, author and founder of the Momofuku restaurant group. In a podcast Chang said: \u201cThis is a complicated situation for me, personally, and I know it raises a lot of questions for people who dine at our restaurants.\u201d Chang praised Ross as a businessman and for his support but said he was on \u201cthe wrong side\u201d. \u201cI personally am a staunch opponent to President Trump and everything he stands for.

Many accuse India of wanting Kashmir\u2019s land, but not Kashmiris.</p> \n<p>In Srinagar, people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence, but the current clampdown is far more intense. Officers from the Central Reserve Police Force, India\u2019s armed police \u2013 who wear helmets and carry rifles \u2013 vastly outnumber Jammu and Kashmir police, who carry batons.

Landlines, mobile, internet coverage and, for many, cable TV have all been blocked.</p> \n<p>People cannot call relatives, or call ambulances if there is an emergency. Public transport is not running, which means those with health problems can only get to a hospital if they have a car \u2013 and even then they struggle to get far.</p> \n<p>Across the city, many roads are permanently blocked by loops of barbed wire. At checkpoints, people \u2013 including families with children \u2013 can be seen pleading with officers to let them pass. Most people, nervous that tensions were building last week, had stocked up on food and essentials, but it\u2019s not known how long the curfew will last.</p> \n<p>On some streets, broken bricks lie in the roads, left over from groups pelting the government forces with stones. At dusk, the sound of teargas canisters can be heard. The security presence is huge, but there are protests taking place at a neighbourhood-level.</p> \n<p>On Friday, the police announced that the curfew would be temporarily eased so that people could attend local mosques for Friday prayers. Some protests broke out afterwards, according to Associated Press, which reported that a group of people began throwing stones at security forces. Paramilitary troops responded by firing tear gas and pellets.</p> \n<p>Before prayers began , at least 50 people were being treated with wounds from pellet guns and rubber bullets at the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital. Due to the communications blackout, it was unclear how many more needed medical help after Friday\u2019s protests.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7017be50ea32906ba04d9b26e61ac109c87f48e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7017be50ea32906ba04d9b26e61ac109c87f48e/0_285_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armed Indian security forces personnel patrol a deserted street in Srinagar August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Armed Indian security forces personnel patrol a deserted street in Srinagar August.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danish Ismail/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hundreds of politicians and activists have reportedly been arrested and taken to temporary detention centres, apparently to prevent violence.</p> \n<p>Some of Kashmir\u2019s most prominent political leaders, people who have formed alliances with parties such as India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, remain in detention.

The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a speech to the nation on Thursday, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, promised he would bring development and prosperity to Kashmir, and that his actions would help rid the state of terrorism.

      "bodyText": "Eid is just days away, and the central market in Srinagar, Lal Chowk, should be bustling with people. Every year crowds flock to its stalls to buy clothes, jewellery and sweets. Sheep and goats \u2013 traditionally offered as a sacrifice \u2013 are brought to the market by nomads from the Kashmir mountains. But this week Lal Chowk was deserted. On Wednesday, only two men \u2013 armed Indian police \u2013 stood opposite the market\u2019s shuttered shops and ice-cream parlours. Srinagar, the main city in Kashmir, is in complete lockdown following a dramatic announcement by the Indian government on Monday, which stripped the territory of its autonomy and divided it in two. \u201cOur lives will be different. This is injustice,\u201d says Nusrat Amin who was out on the empty streets of Srinagar trying to buy medicine. \u201cWe are compelled to come out on roads and fight against the oppression.\u201d Under the changes, Kashmir\u2019s constitution and flag will disappear. Rules that have prevented people from outside Kashmir buying land in the territory, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state, are also scrapped. Many Kashmiris fear the demography of the state, and their way of life, could be altered. Pakistan responded angrily, with the prime minister, Imran Khan, suggesting India could carry out ethnic cleansing, while China called the decision \u201cunacceptable\u201d. The voices of Kashmiris \u2013 whose future will be dramatically affected by the government\u2019s actions \u2013 have been almost completely silenced. Hours before the announcement, millions of people in the territory were placed under strict curfew and a wide-ranging communications blackout. In residential areas, where a few people venture outside to sit in side lanes, there is a deep sense of anger and betrayal. \u201c[On the one hand] they say Kashmir is ours, but at the same time they kill us,\u201d says Mohammad Rafiq, who describes himself as a citizen of Kashmir. \u201cWhatever they are doing here is by power and force,\u201d he says. Many accuse India of wanting Kashmir\u2019s land, but not Kashmiris. In Srinagar, people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence, but the current clampdown is far more intense. Officers from the Central Reserve Police Force, India\u2019s armed police \u2013 who wear helmets and carry rifles \u2013 vastly outnumber Jammu and Kashmir police, who carry batons. Officers, some of whom have never been to Kashmir before, cover every corner. \u201cWhen a child looks out from a window, he sees Indian forces with heavy weapons. What sort of impression would he get on his mind?\u201d says Rafiq. \u201cWill you win the people of Kashmir by love or with the gun or power?\u201d Communications blackout The clampdown on communications is equally harsh, and it is likely that people from outside the city have still not heard about the Indian government\u2019s announcement. Landlines, mobile, internet coverage and, for many, cable TV have all been blocked. People cannot call relatives, or call ambulances if there is an emergency. Public transport is not running, which means those with health problems can only get to a hospital if they have a car \u2013 and even then they struggle to get far. Across the city, many roads are permanently blocked by loops of barbed wire. At checkpoints, people \u2013 including families with children \u2013 can be seen pleading with officers to let them pass. Most people, nervous that tensions were building last week, had stocked up on food and essentials, but it\u2019s not known how long the curfew will last. On some streets, broken bricks lie in the roads, left over from groups pelting the government forces with stones. At dusk, the sound of teargas canisters can be heard. The security presence is huge, but there are protests taking place at a neighbourhood-level. On Friday, the police announced that the curfew would be temporarily eased so that people could attend local mosques for Friday prayers. Some protests broke out afterwards, according to Associated Press, which reported that a group of people began throwing stones at security forces. Paramilitary troops responded by firing tear gas and pellets. Before prayers began , at least 50 people were being treated with wounds from pellet guns and rubber bullets at the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital. Due to the communications blackout, it was unclear how many more needed medical help after Friday\u2019s protests. Hundreds of politicians and activists have reportedly been arrested and taken to temporary detention centres, apparently to prevent violence. Some of Kashmir\u2019s most prominent political leaders, people who have formed alliances with parties such as India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, remain in detention. The entire political spectrum in Kashmir is opposed to the revocation of the territory\u2019s special status. \u2018We have no hope\u2019 In Srinagar, Kashmir\u2019s biggest city, some are disillusioned with mainstream political leaders. Mir Shahid, a local shopkeeper who was sitting outside his closed shop says he has little faith. \u201cThese pro-Indian [Kashmiri] leaders are nothing and we have no hope from them,\u201d he says, pointing out that the voter turnout is extremely low. \u201cHow can we expect them to represent the people of Kashmir. They are not our leaders.\u201d As soon as restrictions are lifted, it is likely there will be a backlash from the people of Kashmir, says Adnan Ashraf, spokesperson Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Conference. \u201cI\u2019m certain that Kashmiris will erupt,\u201d he says, adding that in the long term, India has given the Kashmiris \u201cenough reason to welcome people who they think will fight on their behalf,\u201d pointing to America\u2019s imminent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Neighbouring Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir, has responded to the crisis by announcing plans to expel India\u2019s top diplomat and to suspend trade. The countries have fought two of their three wars over control of Kashmir. In a speech to the nation on Thursday, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, promised he would bring development and prosperity to Kashmir, and that his actions would help rid the state of terrorism. But many in Kashmir, who can\u2019t watch TV, won\u2019t have heard his words. The economic consequences of the shutdown are grave. Hafeez Ahmed, a tour operator, says the decision to evacuate tourists and thousands of Hindu pilgrims last week was unprecedented. The industry was just starting to recover, following a suicide car bombing in February that killed dozens of Indian paramilitaries. \u201cTourists who used to come are more than our guests,\u201d he says. \u201cOur Kashmir is so caring that we used to give food to Yatris (Hindu pilgrims) even in the worst times. And they have evacuated all the tourists and Yatris. Shame on them,\u201d he says. Everyone\u2019s businesses are suffering. The timing of the clampdown, right before Eid, a huge boost to the economy, couldn\u2019t have been worse. \u201cPeople like me no longer have any faith or any expectation in the parliament of India,\u201d says Ashraf, adding that he party he represents believed in a shared and common future within the union of India. \u201cIt\u2019s a majoritarian India trampling down on the rights and freedoms of Kashmiris,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a monumental and historic disaster.\u201d",

Welcome to Premier League's new era of excellence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just before the start of this season every Premier League manager was invited to VAR HQ in Stockley Park, not too far from Heathrow. There they were given a walk-through of how the technology is to be used this year, a plan that follows the culmination of two years of training and a delayed launch which allowed time to watch others get it wrong first.</p> <p>The guiding principle of VAR in the Premier League is that it should interfere as little as possible. For a competition that prides itself on being fast, furious and dramatic, there are serious concerns about disrupting a match to the extent that games might be extended for up to 10 minutes (as they were during the Women\u2019s World Cup).</p> <p>This principle, it has to be said, is what VAR was always supposed to be about. \u201cMaximum benefit, minimum interference\u201d is the phrase used by the International Football Association Board, the body that devised the basic protocols of VAR. It hasn\u2019t always worked like that though and the Premier League hopes a clear message to VARs and some tweaks in how the rules are applied could make a positive difference.</p> <p>This starts with VARs being told they are not there to re-referee a match. Sitting at their hub in Stockley Park they will watch the match as live alongside an assistant VAR and a Recording Operator (RO). When incidents occur within the four categories listed above, they will inform the referee on the pitch that a check is occurring. They will then review footage from as many angles as is necessary until they are satisfied that no error of the \u201cclear and obvious\u201d variety has occurred (while the VAR does that the assistant will take over watching live, just in case there\u2019s another incident in the meantime). When the check is complete, the VAR will press a big red button on their desk and inform the referee of any new information that might effect their decision. After that, it is up to the ref to make the final call .</p> <p>Some errors are objectively observable and therefore more easily correctible. These are situations such as whether a player is offside before a goal is scored, or if a foul adjudged to be a penalty was actually made in the area or just outside it. Some of these calls can be decided simply by checking footage. In the case of offside, the RO will be able to generate a 3D line pinned to the attacker\u2019s most advanced bodypart (arms don\u2019t count) to give their VAR a definitive reading. That information is then fed, via the big red button, back to the ref.</p> <p>It\u2019s with decisions that will always be subjective that things start to get more complicated. Take tackling, for example. A sliding challenge with studs up on one foot could be interpreted by the referee as being \u201creckless\u201d under Rule 12 and therefore deserving of a yellow card. He might alternatively decide, however, that the tackle \u201cendangered the safety of an opponent\u201d and was therefore deserving of a red.</p> <p>In these circumstances the VAR will have their own opinion and will have had access to many more camera angles with which to inform it. But again they will be instructed to defer to the referee unless the high bar for \u201cclear and obvious error\u201d is met. If the referee has seen the foul and decided it\u2019s not that bad, no amount of slo-mo rewinds from a particularly gruesome angle should persuade a VAR to intervene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36438a4b74438870e03233514fb19e2444c0d26a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36438a4b74438870e03233514fb19e2444c0d26a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A VAR screen pitchside at the Liberty Stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A VAR screen pitchside at the Liberty Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crucial to any such decision-making will be communication. A referee is expected to give his VAR a running commentary on the reasons behind the decisions he makes. So if the referee calls \u201creckless\u201d rather than \u201cendangering\u201d he will explain his reasons for doing so. The VAR might then disagree with the interpretation but, unless they had seen something the referee had not, they would be unable to state clearly that an error had been made.</p> <p>That is the principle, though nobody in the Premier League or the refereeing body, Professional Game Match Officials Limited, is under any illusions that there won\u2019t be controversy. A new raft of potentially headline generating rules \u2013 the \u201cunnaturally bigger\u201d handball law amongst them \u2013 will lead to uncertainty.</p> <p>Also look out for lots of heated debate as to quite what constitutes the \u201cattacking phase of play\u201d.

One of the components the Premier League have settled on for determining this point is the \u201cability of the defence to reset\u201d. What constitutes a reset?

      "bodyText": "THE 27 CLUB There\u2019s no need here to reel off the names of all the rock heroes who sadly lost their lives at the age of 27 \u2013 your Jimi Hendrixes, your Jim Morrisons, your Alan \u201cBlind Owl\u201d Wilsons and your Ron \u201cPigpen\u201d McKernans \u2013 because as the Premier League prepares to enter its 27th season since creating English football, there\u2019s absolutely no sign of it succumbing to its excesses. No siree! A division can only be in rude health if Aston Villa are willing to pay \u00a326.5m for Tyrone Mings while Manchester City spend the price of a hospital wing on a reserve right-back. With the Big Kick-off coming barely 24 hours after the climax of Transfer Deadline Day, the Fiver could almost barf with all the excitement! Nine months of dramatic twists and turns await, during which answers will emerge to the great imponderables of the moment: who is most likely to stop City from winning a third title on the trot: Liverpool or John Stones? Which bright young gaffer is more likely to last beyond Christmas: Frank Lampard or Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r? Who will go down with Mr Roy\u2019s Crystal Palace? Did Arsenal really sign David Luiz to bring calm to their defence? Must we talk about West Ham? Appropriately enough, the season begins at the scene of some of English\u2019s football most memorable clashes: Millwa ... no, sorry, Anfield, where Liverpool hope to welcome Norwich to the top flight with a ferocious thrashing. But last season\u2019s Championship winners are undaunted: \u201cYou won\u2019t see us park the bus,\u201d stormed their manager, Daniel Farke. \u201cOur approach will always be to attack and be proactive.\u201d Farke, like J\u00fcrgen Klopp, was at Borussia Dortmund so, inevitably, he was asked whether he has met his compatriot to exchange ideas. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time in this business to sit and talk about philosophy,\u201d replied Farke, who is not scheduled to meet Brendan Rodgers until December. Answers such as that won\u2019t cut it in the Premier League so Farke was invited to try again and was even given a prompt: if Klopp preaches \u201cheavy metal football\u201d, he was asked, what do Norwich play? \u201cRock\u2018n\u2019roll, if you like,\u201d obliged Farke. Truly, the Premier League ain\u2019t noise pollution. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Paul Doyle from 8pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Liverpool 3-0 Norwich. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI am very happy, like I told you before I was happy with my squad and now to add some more players. I am so happy with the way the squad. I was happy before, I am happy plus. I am a happy man\u201d \u2013 Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s repeated insistence that he is satisfied with Tottenham\u2019s transfer dealings makes the Fiver wonder whether the opposite is in fact true. FIVER LETTERS \u201cAs the new season begins, so too does Fifa 19 fade into irrelevance and Fifa 20 swing ominously into view. Before Fifa 19 becomes just another, well, Fifa 18, I\u2019d like to nominate my favourite misheard commentary from Tyler and Smith. Alan wins with what I first heard as: \u2018There\u2019s a huge golfing class out there, Martin.\u2019 As for my least favourite Tyler evocation of a player\u2019s name when shooting for goal, to the point that I can\u2019t actually have the player in my squad, it has to be: \u2018Gabriel jeSUUUS!\u2019 Other nominations gratefully received\u201d \u2013 Kevin McKee. \u201cDaniel Kennedy \u2013 if you are referencing Golas (Thursday\u2019s Fiver Letters), I humbly submit that your age teetered over golden some time ago. Did you ever work for the drug squad police in the car park outside Kinetic in Stoke? For some obscure reason they thought they blended in wearing Gola \u2013 they were wrong\u201d \u2013 Nick Livesey. \u201cPlayer with bad attitude criticises player with bad attitude (with a toilet seat) about a player with a bad attitude (who also probably has a toilet seat but I can\u2019t confirm it)\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis.

A rather less chirpy Daniel Harris bemoans Manchester United\u2019s transfer dealings. How many things are there to look out for in the Premier League this weekend? Ten is the (predictable) answer. Sid Lowe explains why Manchester City\u2019s Rodri is great. Want a verdict on how every top-flight club fared in the transfer window? Sure you do.

You\u2019re not a champion,\u201d Noah said. \u201cLike if racial equality was a sport, you\u2019d be playing pick-up games.\u201d</p> <p>Noah broke down Ross\u2019s defense to its core theme: he supports the business side of Donald Trump, not the racism one. \u201cWhat he\u2019s actually saying without realizing it is that he can afford to support Trump\u2019s business side, because Trump\u2019s racism side doesn\u2019t affect him.\u201d</p> <p>So go ahead and boycott, Noah concluded. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone to the gym in the past three months in preparation for this moment.\u201d</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_YPyWCMFOg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_YPyWCMFOg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert checked in on the race for the Democratic nomination. With the next debate a month away, some candidates who haven\u2019t yet qualified are \u201cgetting desperate\u201d.</p> <p>For example, the Colorado senator Michael Bennet released a proposal in which he promised that as president, \u201cyou won\u2019t have to think about me for 2 weeks at a time\u201d. The tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang unveiled a Spotify playlist of his \u201cfavorite jams\u201d.</p> <p>It remains an open question whether those candidates will make it on the ballot \u2013 just as it\u2019s now a question whether Trump will run in California, since the state passed a law requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns, something Trump has notoriously refused to do.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Trump administration sued California, claiming \u201ca naked political attack against a sitting president\u201d, but since the new law never named Trump directly, his suit \u201cis kind of a weird self-own\u201d, said Colbert. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cGuys, the new PTA rule that says you can\u2019t sneak a lukewarm cocktail of vodka and Crystal Lite into the meetings inside your water bottle is a clear attack against my wife,\u201d Colbert joked.</p>",

What chemical are you missing from your brain that makes you like this?\u201d Trump\u2019s commitment to Twitter has not translated to any solid promises on gun reform, however; Meyers played numerous clips in which the president boasted, vaguely, that Congress was \u201cdoing something on background checks\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re doing something on background checks,\u201d Meyers mocked. \u201cThis is a national emergency and he talks about it with all the specificity of a dad who has no idea where his kids are.\u201d Trevor Noah \u201cFundraising \u2013 it\u2019s as integral a part of American politics as low voter turnout and terrorizing babies,\u201d said Trevor Noah in a Daily Show segment on the blow-up over a Trump fundraiser hosted by Stephen Ross, an investor in the popular gyms Equinox and SoulCycle. Tickets for the fundraiser are reportedly going for up to $250,000, and members of the studios are not happy; several, including celebrities Chrissy Teigen and Billy Eichner, have threatened to boycott them. \u201cTo all those people cancelling their memberships, I say: good luck,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHave you ever tried to get out of a gym membership? It is impossible.\u201d Ross has defended himself with a statement in which he promised to \u201ccontinue to be an outspoken champion of racial equality, inclusion, diversity, public education and environmental stability\u201d. Noah could only laugh at the claim. \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight: if you\u2019re hosting a fundraiser for Donald Trump, I don\u2019t know if you can call yourself a \u2018champion\u2019 of racial equality and inclusion. \u201cYou can call yourself a \u2018contender\u2019 of racial equality, you can call yourself a \u2018part-time participant\u2019 of racial equality, you can call yourself a \u2018dabbler\u2019 of racial equality. You\u2019re not a champion,\u201d Noah said. \u201cLike if racial equality was a sport, you\u2019d be playing pick-up games.\u201d Noah broke down Ross\u2019s defense to its core theme: he supports the business side of Donald Trump, not the racism one. \u201cWhat he\u2019s actually saying without realizing it is that he can afford to support Trump\u2019s business side, because Trump\u2019s racism side doesn\u2019t affect him.\u201d So go ahead and boycott, Noah concluded. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone to the gym in the past three months in preparation for this moment.\u201d Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert checked in on the race for the Democratic nomination. With the next debate a month away, some candidates who haven\u2019t yet qualified are \u201cgetting desperate\u201d. For example, the Colorado senator Michael Bennet released a proposal in which he promised that as president, \u201cyou won\u2019t have to think about me for 2 weeks at a time\u201d. The tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang unveiled a Spotify playlist of his \u201cfavorite jams\u201d. It remains an open question whether those candidates will make it on the ballot \u2013 just as it\u2019s now a question whether Trump will run in California, since the state passed a law requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns, something Trump has notoriously refused to do. On Tuesday, the Trump administration sued California, claiming \u201ca naked political attack against a sitting president\u201d, but since the new law never named Trump directly, his suit \u201cis kind of a weird self-own\u201d, said Colbert. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cGuys, the new PTA rule that says you can\u2019t sneak a lukewarm cocktail of vodka and Crystal Lite into the meetings inside your water bottle is a clear attack against my wife,\u201d Colbert joked.",

Details were scarce in the announcement, but Sharon Tal Yguado, Amazon\u2019s head of scripted programming, then promised \u201ca new epic journey in Middle-earth\u201d.</p> <p>Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey, who is supervising the show\u2019s development, told German fansite <a href=\"https://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/30918/exklusive-interview-with-tom-shippey-concerning-lotronprime/\">Deutsche Tolkien</a> that the estate has refused to allow the series to be set during any period other than the Second Age of Middle-earth. This means Amazon\u2019s adaptation will not cross over at all with events from the Third Age, which were dramatised in Peter Jackson\u2019s Oscar-winning trilogy in which the hobbit Frodo Baggins journeys to destroy the One Ring.</p> <p>Spanning 3,441 years, the Second Age begins after the banishment of the dark lord Morgoth and ends with the first demise of Sauron, Morgoth\u2019s servant and the primary villain in The Lord of the Rings, at the hands of an alliance of elves and men.</p> <p>Shippey said that Amazon \u201chas a relatively free hand\u201d to add details since Tolkien did not flesh out every detail of the Second Age in his appendices or <a href=\"http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Unfinished_Tales\">Unfinished Tales</a>, a collection of stories published posthumously in 1980. But Shippey called it \u201ca bit of a minefield \u2013 you have to tread very carefully\u201d, saying that \u201cthe Tolkien estate will insist that the main shape of the Second Age is not altered. Sauron invades Eriador, is forced back by a N\u00famen\u00f3rean expedition, is returns to N\u00famenor. There he corrupts the N\u00famen\u00f3reans and seduces them to break the ban of the Valar. All this, the course of history, must remain the same.</p> <p>\u201cBut you can add new characters and ask a lot of questions, like: What has Sauron done in the meantime? Where was he after Morgoth was defeated? Theoretically, Amazon can answer these questions by inventing the answers, since Tolkien did not describe it. But it must not contradict anything which Tolkien did say. That\u2019s what Amazon has to watch out for. It must be canonical, it is impossible to change the boundaries which Tolkien has created. It is necessary to remain \u2018Tolkienian\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, the Tolkien estate declined to confirm or deny Shippey\u2019s claim.</p> <p>Amazon\u2019s Lord of the Rings series is predicted to start production in 2020. An official release date has yet to be announced, but Shippey revealed that it would span 22 episodes.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said that Frodo Baggins destroyed the One Ring.</p>",

Spanning 3,441 years, the Second Age begins after the banishment of the dark lord Morgoth and ends with the first demise of Sauron, Morgoth\u2019s servant and the primary villain in The Lord of the Rings, at the hands of an alliance of elves and men. Shippey said that Amazon \u201chas a relatively free hand\u201d to add details since Tolkien did not flesh out every detail of the Second Age in his appendices or Unfinished Tales, a collection of stories published posthumously in 1980. But Shippey called it \u201ca bit of a minefield \u2013 you have to tread very carefully\u201d, saying that \u201cthe Tolkien estate will insist that the main shape of the Second Age is not altered. Sauron invades Eriador, is forced back by a N\u00famen\u00f3rean expedition, is returns to N\u00famenor. There he corrupts the N\u00famen\u00f3reans and seduces them to break the ban of the Valar. All this, the course of history, must remain the same. \u201cBut you can add new characters and ask a lot of questions, like: What has Sauron done in the meantime? Where was he after Morgoth was defeated? Theoretically, Amazon can answer these questions by inventing the answers, since Tolkien did not describe it. But it must not contradict anything which Tolkien did say. That\u2019s what Amazon has to watch out for. It must be canonical, it is impossible to change the boundaries which Tolkien has created. It is necessary to remain \u2018Tolkienian\u2019.\u201d Contacted by the Guardian, the Tolkien estate declined to confirm or deny Shippey\u2019s claim. Amazon\u2019s Lord of the Rings series is predicted to start production in 2020. An official release date has yet to be announced, but Shippey revealed that it would span 22 episodes. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said that Frodo Baggins destroyed the One Ring.",

      "body": "<p>Perhaps we should not be sniffy about the new CEO of the English National Opera, Stuart Murphy, drawing a parallel between opera and Love Island, urging those missing the dating show to visit the Coliseum. \u201cAs my teenagers sat glued to the final of Love Island last week,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/love-island-withdrawal-syndrome-visit-the-opera-a4207551.html\">he writes in the Evening Standard</a>, \u201cit struck me how closely it echoes the drama we see on stage at English National Opera: passion, lust, betrayal, glamour, love, friendship, silliness. Opera has that in spades, just with the world\u2019s most beautiful music.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s right. The parallels with reality TV are plain. There\u2019s certainly plenty of buff dimwits in opera. Think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/01/royal-opera-house-siegfried-review-keith-warner-ring-cycle\">Siegfried</a>, barrel-chested and brainless, tasked with forging a sword, breaking a spear, killing a dragon and walking through a ring of fire to awaken a sleeping goddess before the curtain falls, as if he were in some ancient Norse prototype for a particularly sadistic bush-tucker challenge in I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1370497aa1cb803db8cd21772fb1439a92fcde92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1370497aa1cb803db8cd21772fb1439a92fcde92/400_836_3124_1874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wagner\u2019s Siegfried\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wagner\u2019s Siegfried ... as if in a particularly sadistic bush-tucker challenge in I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out Here?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Cooper/Photo_ Bill Cooper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or, in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/classical/thering/essentials_gotterdammerung.shtml\">G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung</a>, we find him tricked by a rival into betraying the love of his life. Siegfried is so deranged by Hagen\u2019s drug that he becomes enraptured of another woman and tries to win his own wife Br\u00fcnnhilde for her brother, Gunther. They don\u2019t allow drugs on the set of Love Island, but otherwise this kind of storyline would keep the twitterati and op-ed commentators seething for weeks about the commodification of women\u2019s bodies and the structural misogyny of heteronormative dating rites \u2013 just as they did with ITV\u2019s reality show.</p> <p>Whenever <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g7mhm\">Radio 3 cuts to New York for a live opera broadcast from the Met</a>, the serious laying out of the plot is one of the funniest things on radio. At such moments opera makes The Only Way Is Essex seem like Proust. A bird pecks a king to death (Rimsky Korsakov\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/09/the-golden-cockerel-rimsky-korsakov-coliseum-review\">The Golden Cockerel</a>). Women dude it up in unconvincing moustaches and terrible trousers (Il Trovatore or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/02/the-marriage-of-figaro-review-royal-opera-house-london-gardiner-mcvicar\">The Marriage of Figaro</a>). Young man change clothes, add hats and facial hair and their devoted girlfriends fail to recognise them (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/06/cosi-fan-tutte-review-lovers-recoupled-in-impressive-mozart\">Cosi fan Tutte</a>). Death-bed arias that require more puff than anyone truly expiring from consumption could muster (La Traviata or La Boh\u00e8me). And then there\u2019s Weber\u2019s Der Freisch\u00fctz in which a man shoots an eagle with golden bullets to win his bride (based, amusingly enough, on my marriage).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7a4c2354fcb9f47b289373e1c9be2ced17d978a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7a4c2354fcb9f47b289373e1c9be2ced17d978a/0_211_4525_2714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018What\u2019s regarded as the basest culture is rarely as worthless as detractors might suggest \u2013 just like opera\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What\u2019s regarded as the basest culture is rarely as worthless as detractors might suggest \u2013 just like opera\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let\u2019s not forget my favourite opera storyline: the man who gives birth to 40,049 babies in one day. It just sounds like an instalment of Channel 4\u2019s Embarrassing Bodies but it\u2019s actually the plot twist of Poulenc\u2019s Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias after women revolt against bearing babies for reasons too barmy to get into. If ITV had a show called Opera\u2019s Stupidest Storylines to fill the hole in schedules left by Love Island (and it really should), it could run from now until Christmas.</p> <p>What made critics such as <a href=\"https://slippedisc.com/2019/08/enos-future-ceo-says-it-should-be-more-like-love-island/\">Norman Lebrecht set up a harrumphing chorus</a>, though, was Murphy\u2019s suggestion that it would be \u201chealthy\u201d for his as-yet-unappointed new artistic director to be \u201caware of the pull\u201d of popular culture such as Love Island, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/farewell-fleabag-the-most-electrifying-devastating-tv-in-years\">Fleabag</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/23/avengers-endgame-review-unconquerable-brilliance-takes-marvel-to-new-heights\">superhero films</a> in order to win over audiences to the opera.</p> <p>What Murphy didn\u2019t suggest, but which may be even more healthy, is that popular culture should be aware of the pull of opera, and consider plundering it for material rather than miring itself in franchise remakes of the same old rubbish (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/31/fast-furious-hobbs-shaw-review-dwayne-johnson-jason-statham-idris-elba\">Fast and Furious </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/31/fast-furious-hobbs-shaw-review-dwayne-johnson-jason-statham-idris-elba\">9</a> \u2013 really?). In particular, I suggest that creatively drained Hollywood should do a reverse takeover of opera. Instead of ENO making Love Island: The Opera, what the world is crying out for is Der Ring Des Niebelungen, the movie franchise. It has three built-in sequels for starters and could be readily cast with Russell Crowe as Wotan, Margot Robbie as Brunnhilde, Tom Hiddleston as Loge and someone who really knows how to play dumb (Channing Tatum?) as Siegfried. Hollywood more than ENO needs to be creatively revived.</p> <p>Murphy is at his most rhetorically feeble when he argues that opera needs to broaden out to survive and to draw in young people. Opera, or any art form, is at its most hopeless and cynical when it strives to second-guess the supposed zeitgeist, when it tries to woo new demographics by retooling what\u2019s worked elsewhere. </p> <p>Opera is at its most biting when we get plunged beneath its sometimes silly surface and exposed to something unexpectedly profound. Take Berg\u2019s Lulu. For all that many productions attempt to lure audiences with promises and posters of a sexpot who can\u2019t keep her clothes on and who is ultimately (spoiler alert!) murdered by Jack the Ripper, it is as heartbreaking and instructive about the patriarchy as any work of art.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the curious thing: something similar can be said of the ostensibly vacuous dramas that play out on Love Island. \u201cLove Island\u2019s capacity to spark wider discussions around consent, relationships and gender is part of what makes it such a fascinating show,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/04/love-island-kindness-abuse-behaviour\">wrote Stephanie Boland in the Guardian</a>. Critics of the show focused on the practice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/05/love-island-has-a-gaslighting-problem-yet-again\">gaslighting</a>. Love Island, it has been suggested, was holding up a magnifying glass to many women\u2019s reality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ca57b0354071ecb1f896abcc435a1695f6ebf28e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca57b0354071ecb1f896abcc435a1695f6ebf28e/0_84_1648_2060/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Berg\u2019s Lulu is as heartbreaking and instructive about the patriarchy as any work of art.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Berg\u2019s Lulu is as heartbreaking and instructive about the patriarchy as any work of art.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which is to say that even what\u2019s regarded as the basest mass culture is rarely as stupid or worthless as detractors might suggest.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps we should not be sniffy about the new CEO of the English National Opera, Stuart Murphy, drawing a parallel between opera and Love Island, urging those missing the dating show to visit the Coliseum. \u201cAs my teenagers sat glued to the final of Love Island last week,\u201d he writes in the Evening Standard, \u201cit struck me how closely it echoes the drama we see on stage at English National Opera: passion, lust, betrayal, glamour, love, friendship, silliness. Opera has that in spades, just with the world\u2019s most beautiful music.\u201d He\u2019s right. The parallels with reality TV are plain. There\u2019s certainly plenty of buff dimwits in opera. Think of Siegfried, barrel-chested and brainless, tasked with forging a sword, breaking a spear, killing a dragon and walking through a ring of fire to awaken a sleeping goddess before the curtain falls, as if he were in some ancient Norse prototype for a particularly sadistic bush-tucker challenge in I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. Or, in G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, we find him tricked by a rival into betraying the love of his life. Siegfried is so deranged by Hagen\u2019s drug that he becomes enraptured of another woman and tries to win his own wife Br\u00fcnnhilde for her brother, Gunther. They don\u2019t allow drugs on the set of Love Island, but otherwise this kind of storyline would keep the twitterati and op-ed commentators seething for weeks about the commodification of women\u2019s bodies and the structural misogyny of heteronormative dating rites \u2013 just as they did with ITV\u2019s reality show. Whenever Radio 3 cuts to New York for a live opera broadcast from the Met, the serious laying out of the plot is one of the funniest things on radio. At such moments opera makes The Only Way Is Essex seem like Proust. A bird pecks a king to death (Rimsky Korsakov\u2019s The Golden Cockerel). Women dude it up in unconvincing moustaches and terrible trousers (Il Trovatore or The Marriage of Figaro). Young man change clothes, add hats and facial hair and their devoted girlfriends fail to recognise them (Cosi fan Tutte). Death-bed arias that require more puff than anyone truly expiring from consumption could muster (La Traviata or La Boh\u00e8me). And then there\u2019s Weber\u2019s Der Freisch\u00fctz in which a man shoots an eagle with golden bullets to win his bride (based, amusingly enough, on my marriage). Let\u2019s not forget my favourite opera storyline: the man who gives birth to 40,049 babies in one day. It just sounds like an instalment of Channel 4\u2019s Embarrassing Bodies but it\u2019s actually the plot twist of Poulenc\u2019s Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias after women revolt against bearing babies for reasons too barmy to get into. If ITV had a show called Opera\u2019s Stupidest Storylines to fill the hole in schedules left by Love Island (and it really should), it could run from now until Christmas. What made critics such as Norman Lebrecht set up a harrumphing chorus, though, was Murphy\u2019s suggestion that it would be \u201chealthy\u201d for his as-yet-unappointed new artistic director to be \u201caware of the pull\u201d of popular culture such as Love Island, Fleabag and superhero films in order to win over audiences to the opera. What Murphy didn\u2019t suggest, but which may be even more healthy, is that popular culture should be aware of the pull of opera, and consider plundering it for material rather than miring itself in franchise remakes of the same old rubbish (Fast and Furious 9 \u2013 really?). In particular, I suggest that creatively drained Hollywood should do a reverse takeover of opera. Instead of ENO making Love Island: The Opera, what the world is crying out for is Der Ring Des Niebelungen, the movie franchise. It has three built-in sequels for starters and could be readily cast with Russell Crowe as Wotan, Margot Robbie as Brunnhilde, Tom Hiddleston as Loge and someone who really knows how to play dumb (Channing Tatum?) as Siegfried. Hollywood more than ENO needs to be creatively revived. Murphy is at his most rhetorically feeble when he argues that opera needs to broaden out to survive and to draw in young people. Opera, or any art form, is at its most hopeless and cynical when it strives to second-guess the supposed zeitgeist, when it tries to woo new demographics by retooling what\u2019s worked elsewhere. Opera is at its most biting when we get plunged beneath its sometimes silly surface and exposed to something unexpectedly profound. Take Berg\u2019s Lulu. For all that many productions attempt to lure audiences with promises and posters of a sexpot who can\u2019t keep her clothes on and who is ultimately (spoiler alert!) murdered by Jack the Ripper, it is as heartbreaking and instructive about the patriarchy as any work of art. But here\u2019s the curious thing: something similar can be said of the ostensibly vacuous dramas that play out on Love Island. \u201cLove Island\u2019s capacity to spark wider discussions around consent, relationships and gender is part of what makes it such a fascinating show,\u201d wrote Stephanie Boland in the Guardian. Critics of the show focused on the practice of gaslighting. Love Island, it has been suggested, was holding up a magnifying glass to many women\u2019s reality. Which is to say that even what\u2019s regarded as the basest mass culture is rarely as stupid or worthless as detractors might suggest. Just like opera. Opera, what\u2019s more, has dealt effectively with pop culture icons before. It has stooped to conquer. Richard Thomas and Stewart Lee\u2019s Jerry Springer: The Opera was a disgusting but brilliant skewering of the TV host\u2019s working methods, among other things. If there was a problem with Mark-Anthony Turnage\u2019s Anna Nicole, about the tragic life of the eponymous Playboy playmate turned TV personality, it was that the music ran out before the wrenching biographical material. Equally, John Adams\u2019 Doctor Atomic (about J Robert Oppenheimer, Project Manhattan and the ethics of the bomb) or The Death of Klinghoffer (in which Arab terrorists take Jewish holidaymakers hostage on a cruise ship) show that opera need not be all gender swapping and bird-interfering silliness. Maybe Stormzy and Skepta should be invited to do a knife-crime grime opera loosely adapted from Romeo and Juliet at the Coliseum. But, probably, ENO should think of other ways to stave off obsolescence. What works creatively is happily unpredictable; what generally doesn\u2019t work, by contrast, is when artistic directors second-guess audiences and commission what they think will get them down with the kids but invariably only makes them look sillier than a Poulenc opera plot.",

      "bodyText": "Kylie Jenner, the Keeping up with the Kardashians reality TV star whose eponymous cosmetics empire has turned her into the world\u2019s youngest billionaire, will this weekend spend more than \u00a31m on a party to celebrate her 22nd birthday onboard a $126m (\u00a3104m) superyacht. Jenner has chartered the 91.5m (300ft) yacht Tranquility, which features a swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna, Turkish bath, an \u201cexperiential shower\u201d, a cinema and helicopter landing pad, to party in the Mediterranean this weekend. Jenner, who has 143 million followers on Instagram, built her business on $29 Kylie Lip Kits, which promise \u201cthe perfect pout\u201d. She arrived in Italy in usual billionaire style, flying in from Los Angeles by private jet before boarding the Tranquility from the picturesque village of Positano on Thursday. The yacht, the world\u2019s 71st-largest, is described on its website as \u201cthe ultimate blend of luxury living and indulgent relaxation\u201d. It costs \u20ac1.1m-a-week \u2013 \u201cplus expenses\u201d \u2013 to charter and has up to 29 crew to sail the boat and cater to the guests. Kylie\u2019s contingent includes her rapper and music producer boyfriend, Travis Scott, 18-month-old daughter Stormi, her mother and \u201cmomager\u201d Kris, and friends including the Hollywood actor Scott Disick and model Sofia Richie. The vessel quickly headed off to the exclusive island of Capri. As well as hosting an extravagant party for her birthday on Saturday, Jenner will also be launching a new product for the cosmetics empire, this time a \u201cmust-have\u201d body powder.. The party yacht, which was named yacht of the year at the World Superyacht Awards in 2014, was previously owned by Jho Low, a fugitive billionaire. Low is wanted by Malaysian and US authorities in connection with the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund scandal. He is accused of using money from the Malaysian fund to buy a private jet, artworks by Van Gogh and Monet, homes in London, New York and California, and a rare 22-carat pink diamond necklace valued at $27.3m. He also helped finance Hollywood blockbuster, The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Low denies all the charges, but his whereabouts are currently unknown. Malaysian authorities seized the yacht, which it claims Low bought with $250m of stolen government funds, last year and sold it to the casino operator Genting Malaysia for $126m. Genting is chartering out the yacht, previously called Equanimity, via British broker Camper &amp; Nicholsons. The broker describes the boat, fitted out by the billionaire\u2019s designer of choice, Britain\u2019s Andrew Winch, as \u201ciconic\u201d and \u201ctruly exceptional\u201d. \u201cAn ocean-crossing world explorer, this iconic superyacht boasts a vast 20sq m swimming pool and accommodation for up to 22 guests,\u201d the brochure states. \u201cGuest facilities include a spectacular beach club which transitions through to a fully equipped gym boasting a large balcony on the starboard side allowing direct access to the sea, and an indulgent spa suite \u2013 complete with a sauna, Hammam [Turkish bath], experiential showers, plunge pool and a massage/treatment room.\u201d Scott started the celebrations for Jenner\u2019s birthday earlier this week by covering the hallway of her LA mansion in thousands of rose petals, and left a card saying \u201cwe\u2019re just getting started. Happy Birthday.\u201d In an Instagram caption she wrote: \u201cThis man covered my house in roses omg!\u201d while his song \u201cWake up\u201d from his album Astroworld played. It is thought that Jenner\u2019s birthday plans have been masterminded by wedding and party planning consultant Mindy Weiss, who has arranged other over-the-top celebrations for Jenner, including Stormi\u2019s first birthday party. The event \u2013 christened StormiWorld \u2013 involved creating a whole theme park, which guests entered through a giant inflatable head of Stormi before walking through a corridor of fake clouds and rain \u2013 an apparent \u201cstorm\u201d. Stormi\u2019s first birthday presents included a Chanel purse, given to her by Jenner\u2019s chum DJ Khaled. In a video, filmed by Jenner, her mum is heard to say: \u201cOh Stormi! Your first Chanel.\u201d Weiss also arranged Kris Jenner\u2019s Gatsby-themed 60th birthday in 2015, an Alice in Wonderland-themed first birthday for Chicago West (the daughter of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian), and Kylie Jenner\u2019s 21st birthday. She said arranging parties for the Kardashians was the favourite part of her job. \u201cThey\u2019re all very creative. We\u2019re so excited every time we get called to do one because they have their own ideas,\u201d she told W magazine earlier this year. \u201cKanye being the most creative. He\u2019s so visual and steps out of the box and he really inspires me, and he inspires the whole family.\u201d Jenner is not the only billionaire sailing around the Med on a superyacht this summer. American billionaire media executive David Geffen has been posting regular updates on his holiday with a string of other other billionaires. Partying this week with Geffen on his $590m superyacht Rising Sun, sailing around Ibiza and the Balearics are Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, his new girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, former Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein, venture capitalist Joshua Kushner and his supermodel wife, Karlie Kloss, and oil heir Mikey Hess. A week earlier Geffen hosted Oprah Winfrey, and in July Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry popped aboard. Last summer he was joined by business billionaire Henry Kravis, Jerry Seinfeld, Tom Hanks and Bradley Cooper.",

On the bright side, the Prime Minister\u2019s plans for \u2018boosterism\u2019 \u2013 government spending to support the UK economy \u2013 could serve as a counterbalance to recent stagnation. With uncertainty over Brexit still high, however, the outcome for growth remains uncertain. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fed2136309a55b2e37065b015d33c9f93c1ca0f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fed2136309a55b2e37065b015d33c9f93c1ca0f3/0_0_699_556/500.jpg\" alt=\"British economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter.\" width=\"500\" height=\"398\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4d30058f084f687f3536c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-09T08:36:32.424Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sterling has fallen against the US dollar and the euro in the aftermath of the GDP figures.</strong></p> <p>The pound is now down by 0.3% against the euro and 0.25% against the US dollar, after UK economic growth came in significantly lower than expected.</p> <p>Economists had predicted growth to flatline at 0% \u2013 but GDP actually contracted by 0.2%, a fairly big miss.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4d2ec18f08c7e177d476b8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-09T08:30:41.542Z\">9.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK economy contracts by 0.2% as Brexit uncertainty bites</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK economy shrank by 0.2% in the second quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-09T08:33:31.842Z\">at 9.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4d2a1d8f08c7e177d476a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-09T08:21:05.298Z\">9.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sterling is slightly weaker against the US dollar and the euro on Friday morning, after a brutal fortnight under the new prime minister, Boris Johnson.</strong></p> <p>His determination to leave the EU on 31 October \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\">\u201cdo or die\u201d</a>, whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/08/no-10-refuses-to-rule-out-election-shortly-after-31-october-brexit\">EU backs down on the backstop</a> (the insurance policy preventing a hard border between the UK and Ireland) or not \u2013 has left the pound at about $1.21 against the US dollar, around the lowest levels in two years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da05d13f20d4706b2cd5202b7875a88f45c6b021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da05d13f20d4706b2cd5202b7875a88f45c6b021/0_0_1189_638/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sterling is at around the lowest level in two years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"537\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sterling is at around the lowest level in two years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Friday will see a rare diversion from Brexit to the macroeconomy as we get the GDP figures, said <strong>Derek Halpenny</strong> and <strong>Fritz Louw</strong>, analysts at <strong>MUFG Bank</strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The downside risk for the pound is for a contraction in growth, which would likely spur headlines about a possible recession.</p> </blockquote> <p>Still, attention will inevitably return to Brexit, and when exactly a general election will come.

      "bodyText": "So it\u2019s official: the UK economy contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter \u2013 a worse performance than stagnation predicted on average by economists beforehand. Sterling hit new two-year lows against the US dollar on Friday because of the shock, and economists\u2019 attention is turning now to whether the UK is currently in recession. Matthew Oxenford, Europe analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: The next two quarters are likely to be marked by significant uncertainty over Brexit, and this slow rate of growth makes it more likely that the UK will enter a recession, especially in the event of a no-deal exit from the EU on 31 October. Business investment in the second quarter of 2019 was about 13% lower than it would have been had the pre-referendum trend (from 2010 onwards) continued, according to Berenberg economists. That would weigh on future growth, they said: The persistent threat of a hard Brexit since June 2016 has weighed heavily on the risk appetite of UK businesses. Unsurprisingly, investment has fared badly. Somewhat ironically, the latest Brexit deadline could actually save the UK from a technical recession (two quarters of contraction) as companies build up stocks once more. The same force \u201cboosted\u201d growth in the first three months of the year, but don\u2019t pop the champagne: as Friday\u2019s data demonstrates, any sugar rush is very temporary. The data put pressure on the government, according to David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies. He said: If the need arrives, the next Bank of England governor has to be able to say truth to power, especially when it comes to issues surrounding financial stability and if, like 1976, there is a run on sterling. And buckle up for another Italian election. Milan\u2019s FTSE MIB index fell by Imogen Bachra, European rates strategist at NatWest Markets, said the investment bank has stopped buying Italian government bonds. Yields (which move inversely to prices) on Italian government debt rose steeply on Friday to hit the highest in a month. But Mario Draghi and Christine Lagarde, the current and future heads of the European Central Bank, will prevent a more major Italian debt sell-off with more quantitative easing bond buying, she added: New elections are now a base case. Markets were not blindsided and have been increasingly pricing election risk, but this is still a step change. The threat of fresh elections will worry markets, but significant widening should be contained by quantitative easing expectations as markets weigh-up the additional political uncertainty against the prospect of the end of this almost-worst-case government. Thanks for following our coverage of business, economics and markets today. Join us as ever on Monday. JJ Sky News reports that the government has agreed to provide financial support to British Steel potentially worth \u00a3300m in a bid to secure its future. Ministers at the business department have signed off on a deal that will allow Ataer, a subsidiary of the Turkish military pension fund, a formal period of exclusivity for its offer of about \u00a370m, Sky reported. Just in on British Steel: a mystery bidder claims to have entered the fray to buy British Steel, days before a vehicle owned by the Turkish military pension fund was expected to enter exclusive talks with the government. Sources familiar with the potential buyer said it was a consortium of British and west African investors with ties to the construction industry.

The agency said fears about the economic impact of the US trade war with China have caused oil prices to slide despite flaring tensions in the Middle East which would typically cause markets to spike. You can read more from the Guardian\u2019s Jillian Ambrose here: Shares on Wall Street have fallen at the opening bell in New York. The Nasdaq lost 0.5% in early trade, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average dipped by 0.2%. Here\u2019s some more on the FTSE 100\u2019s largest riser, WPP. Shares are up by 7.5%. The advertising firm beat City forecasts, sparking investor hopes that a three-year plan to rejuvenate the beleaguered advertising giant is starting to pay off. The company, which has been struggling to recover from a string of client losses after the sudden departure of Sir Martin Sorrell last year, limited its revenue decline to 1.4% in the second quarter. This was less than half the fall expected by City, and the rare bit of good news for investors sent WPP\u2019s shares up more than 7%, outperforming the wider FTSE, which was down 0.3%. Here\u2019s more from the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney: There is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of the UK falling into recession when figures come out in November, according to the influential National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr). Their forecasts, based on the latest data, suggest that the economy will grow in the the July-September period by 0.2% \u2013 meaning the economy would be flat in the middle of the year, not in recession. However, Garry Young, Niesr\u2019s director of macroeconomic modelling and forecasting, said: Economic growth in the United Kingdom was negative in the second quarter of 2019 and is set to remain weak in the third quarter in the face of a global slowdown and continuing Brexit-related uncertainty. Our latest estimate implies that there is a significant risk that the economy is already in a recession that began in April, and the clear possibility of a more material downturn should there be a no-deal Brexit. Summer is cancelled \u2013 at least, it is if you happen to be a special adviser to Boris Johnson\u2019s government. Johnson\u2019s chief of staff cancelled all leave for government advisers until 31 October in a missive on Thursday night, raising further speculation the government is planning for a forced snap election in the aftermath of the UK leaving the EU with no deal. Special advisers, or spads, as they are not very affectionately known, will be compensated on a \u201ccase-by-case basis\u201d if they have already booked time off. The email to spads said: There is serious work to be done between now and October 31st and we should be focused on the job. More here from the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Elgot: Historic shipyard Harland and Wolff ceased trading on Monday. The Guardian\u2019s Rory Carroll has spoken to workers at the site where Titanic was built. Job losses have already started. In a statement on Friday, the administrators said some workers have been offered redundancy and have taken it. Others have been laid off until Friday 16 August but are not being paid because the yard has \u201cinsufficient funds to cover the current running costs of the business\u201d. The lay-offs, they said, provide a few more days to look for a buyer. They added: \u201cA number of interested parties/potential bidders have come forward since our appointment and we are expediently following up on these inquiries in an effort to seek a viable commercial solution. This is our focus and we are working closely with interested parties and stakeholders with the aim of securing a positive outcome.\u201d Yet if a buyer can\u2019t be found it could end centuries of shipbuilding, the industry that put Belfast on the map.

Bayer acquired Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers as part of its $63bn takeover of Monsanto last year, but the acquisition proved disastrous as a California court ruled that Monsanto should have told customers about alleged cancer risks. Bayer shares have lost more than a third, or roughly \u20ac30bn (\u00a328bn), in market value since August last year, Reuters reported. Losses for the pound are gaining momentum as the US wakes up.

Two years ago, on 29 August 2017, it traded as low as \u20ac1.0743. Anything below that level would be quite something: the worst since October 2009, the depths of the financial crisis. Holidaymakers are always in the firing line of downward currency moves so imagine the feeling if your whole business relies on buying services abroad. That\u2019s the sinking feeling that travel operator On The Beach has been feeling today, after it warned on profits. Shares in the FTSE-listed firm are down by 15%. Here\u2019s a surprising fact from Reuters: Unlike travel groups such as Tui and Thomas Cook, On The Beach does not hedge against currency fluctuations, meaning hotel rooms booked in euros are becoming more expensive for customers who take the hit. With the increased likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, sterling has significantly devalued. This [...] leads to a significant increase in On The Beach prices versus full-risk competitors with currency hedges. Chancellor Sajid Javid has been talking to the BBC in the aftermath of the GDP figures. He said: No one will be surprised by today\u2019s figures [...] The important thing is that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong. He added that he is not frightened or worried about a no-deal Brexit, and he is comfortable that the UK can handle leaving without a deal. However, there is still more to do to prepare for that situation, he said. The sterling sell-off on currency markets has steepened: the pound is now below $1.21 against the US dollar and below \u20ac1.08 against the euro. That represents a daily decline of 0.5% against the euro, and 0.3% against the dollar: lows of \u20ac1.0784 and $1.2078 respectively. Thank you to Carlito1996 in the comments for dredging this link up from way back in the mists of time \u2013 21 June 2016, just before the Brexit referendum: Boris Johnson promising to apologise if a Brexit vote led to a recession. Two major caveats: the original question was slightly imprecise, so the new prime minister may have been referring to forecasts of an immediate recession following a vote in favour of leaving. And the UK has not reached recession, and many economists do not expect it to. Nevertheless, Johnson\u2019s video is worth a watch. His promise came in response to a caller to radio station LBC, who asked the former mayor of London: \u201cIf we Brexit and we go into recession, would you have the political courage, to go on TV \u2026 and say sorry, I made it wrong and I apologise?\u201d Of course I will [...] I\u2019m not certain what my political career holds anyway. This is far more important than any individual political career. Meanwhile, Facebook is reportedly in talks with news publishers to offer \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d for the rights to publish their material on its site. The move follows years of criticism over its growing monopolization of online advertising to the detriment of the struggling news industry. The Wall Street Journal reported last night that Facebook representatives had told news executives that they\u2019d pay as much as $3m (\u00a32.5m) a year to license stories, headlines and other material. You can read more here: A small diversion away from the UK GDP figures to a story from earlier this morning: the crisis caused by the 1MDB at the Goldman Sachs has deepened, with new charges against the US investment bank and bosses. Malaysia has filed criminal charges against 17 current and former directors at subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs Group in a multibillion-dollar corruption investigation at state fund 1MDB, the attorney general said on Friday. Goldman Sachs has been under scrutiny for its role in helping to raise $6.5bn through bond offerings for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries. You can read the full story here: A spectre is haunting the UK \u2013 the spectre of recession. However, Capital Economics \u2013 admittedly among the more bullish forecasters in the City \u2013 predicts that the third quarter will be stronger in part because of the rearranged car manufacturing calendar we noted earlier. \u201cThe UK should avoid a recession\u2026 unless there\u2019s a no deal Brexit,\u201d said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at the consultancy \u2013 despite weak purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) data, a leading indicator. The PMIs have been pretty dire so far, but the fact that many car manufacturers will be working in August when they are normally closed will probably add about 0.2 percentage points to quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the third quarter. As such, we think the economy will grow in the third quarter, which would mean that the UK economy avoids a recession. But how the fourth quarter turns out is entirely dependent on whether there\u2019s a Brexit deal or no deal. We won\u2019t know if the UK is in recession until 11 November, after the 31 October Brexit date. Is it possible that a governing party could go into a snap election after that point with a \u201crecession\u201d label stamped across it? It\u2019s the first GDP data on the watch of Sajid Javid as chancellor \u2013 and quite a welcome. Javid said: This is a challenging period across the global economy, with growth slowing in many countries. But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong \u2013 wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we\u2019re forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year. The government is determined to provide certainty to people and businesses on Brexit \u2013 that\u2019s why we are clear that the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October. I\u2019ve announced an accelerated spending round so ministers can focus on delivering Brexit, while also delivering the investment we promised in priority areas like schools, police and our NHS. Remember: before the financial crisis the trend growth rate was 2% a year, or about 0.5% per quarter. Here is the long-term view of the GDP figures. As you can see it\u2019s the joint worst since 2009, when the UK economy nose-dived following the banking crash. The Confederation of British Industry, the lobby group for big business, said that much of the weakness came from \u201cone-off factors\u201d, even if the data was \u201cconcerning\u201d. Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, said: It\u2019s clear from our business surveys that underlying momentum remains lukewarm, choked by a combination of slower global growth and Brexit uncertainty. As a result, business sentiment is dire. Securing a Brexit deal before the October 31 deadline is the first step to revving up the economy. The second is re-focusing attention on vital domestic priorities \u2013 such as pressing ahead with key infrastructure projects \u2013 to boost productivity and growth potential over the longer-term. The business and economics community has been taken by surprise by the extent of the weakness in the British economy in the second quarter. Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: Contraction in the second quarter is a rude awakening after the growth in the first three months of the year, and confirmation of the concerns businesses have been expressing about the economy. With the nature of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU looking likely to be determined at the eleventh hour, the economy is facing a bumpy ride going into the third quarter. Another round of stockpiling is complicated by preparations for Christmas and by firms\u2019 previous experience of spending money to no avail. While consumers have helped keep the economy afloat, it is increasingly worrying that underlying growth is largely absent. Whatever happens on 31 October, the government needs to give business leaders a significant shot in the arm to return investment and productivity growth to the country after a prolonged period of uncertainty. As expected, the manufacturing sector has borne the brunt of the economic weakness \u2013 in the main because carmakers pulled forward planned shutdown periods. It\u2019s the worst manufacturing performance since the financial crisis. Manufacturing growth saw the biggest rolling three-month fall since April 2009, at negative 2.3%. You can see the effects of the shutdowns pretty starkly in the below graph. There is a good argument that the manufacturing sector could bounce back in the next quarter. Most of those shutdowns were changes to maintenance timetables, meaning car factories are expected to be working at points this summer when they usually would be closed. However, the car industry is already struggling on multiple fronts \u2013 with lower demand for diesel vehicles and weaker sales in the massive Chinese market \u2013 so don\u2019t hold your breath for the autos to drive to the rescue of the economy just yet. The FTSE 100 is now down by 0.26%, while the FTSE 250 (which is generally considered to be more exposed to the UK economy) has reversed earlier gains to trade marginally down for the day. Sterling is holding lower at just over \u20ac1.08 against the euro and $1.21 against the US dollar. The UK economy contracted, but it is not technically in a recession: a recession is generally considered to be two consecutive quarters of lower GDP. Nevertheless it is \u201cgrim viewing\u201d, said David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trading firm XTB. This marks the first time in over six years that we\u2019ve had a quarterly contraction in economic activity and given the growing threat of a no-deal Brexit that looms menacingly overhead, it would not be at all surprising if the current quarter also shows a contraction \u2013 therefore meeting the standard definition of a recession with consecutive drops in quarterly GDP. The solid 1st quarter growth of 0.5% owes a lot to companies stockpiling ahead of the 29th March Brexit deadline that never came and it\u2019s pretty obvious that economic activity is clearly slowing. It was the worst performance in six and a half years, as growth was held back by Brexit uncertainty and car factory shutdowns. The ONS data showed that all three main sectors of the economy \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction \u2013 struggled in the three months to June. The slowdown \u2013 which leaves the annual growth rate at 1.2% \u2013 was considerably worse than the Bank of England\u2019s forecast in its quarterly inflation report. Early evidence has suggested slightly stronger activity at the start of the third quarter of 2019. Here is the full story from the Guardian\u2019s Larry Elliott: The last time UK economic growth was slower was 2009, the depths of the financial crisis. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, said: There\u2019s no denying that the UK\u2019s GDP figures are a cause for concern. However, the jury\u2019s still out on the extent of inventory built-up. We are likely to see a similar phenomenon ahead of October, as firms look to mitigate supply chain disruption in the case of a no-deal Brexit, which may provide short-term support for GDP. On the whole though, there\u2019s no doubt the UK is struggling. The services and automotive sectors have decelerated, construction and manufacturing have declined, and business activity has stalled. The impact of Brexit is no doubt exacerbated by the wider global slowdown. The MPC has already warned on Britain\u2019s growth forecasts, and a rate cut this side of Christmas is looking ever more likely under in a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit scenario. On the bright side, the Prime Minister\u2019s plans for \u2018boosterism\u2019 \u2013 government spending to support the UK economy \u2013 could serve as a counterbalance to recent stagnation. With uncertainty over Brexit still high, however, the outcome for growth remains uncertain. Sterling has fallen against the US dollar and the euro in the aftermath of the GDP figures. The pound is now down by 0.3% against the euro and 0.25% against the US dollar, after UK economic growth came in significantly lower than expected. Economists had predicted growth to flatline at 0% \u2013 but GDP actually contracted by 0.2%, a fairly big miss. The UK economy shrank by 0.2% in the second quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics. Sterling is slightly weaker against the US dollar and the euro on Friday morning, after a brutal fortnight under the new prime minister, Boris Johnson. His determination to leave the EU on 31 October \u2013 \u201cdo or die\u201d, whether the EU backs down on the backstop (the insurance policy preventing a hard border between the UK and Ireland) or not \u2013 has left the pound at about $1.21 against the US dollar, around the lowest levels in two years. Friday will see a rare diversion from Brexit to the macroeconomy as we get the GDP figures, said Derek Halpenny and Fritz Louw, analysts at MUFG Bank. The downside risk for the pound is for a contraction in growth, which would likely spur headlines about a possible recession. Still, attention will inevitably return to Brexit, and when exactly a general election will come. An election shortly after 31 October makes sense for various reasons, Halpenny said. Halpenny and Louw said: If the Conservative party does manage to deliver Brexit, it would make sense for them to capitalise on this \u201cvictory\u201d, regardless of the means by which it was achieved, before whatever material negative consequences manifest and give the Labour party a stronger platform to campaign on. In the UK the economy is suffering from its own stockpiling hangover. Building up piles of products causes a boost in the short term, but in reality it just changes the timing of spending. So in the first three months of the year the economy grew by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter, but many economists expect that was merely dragging activity forward. The highest forecast for this quarter in the Treasury\u2019s handy collection says a 0.3% gain, so it would be a major shock if there were anything other than a slowdown. Remember too that before the financial crisis long-term trend growth was about 2% per year, so 0.5% per quarter was not usually described in glowing terms. Some more on that German trade data (before we lead up to the GDP figures in about 45 minutes). The trade data gave an end to a \u201cdisappointing second quarter\u201d, ahead of the first GDP estimate, said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany. A small contraction is now more likely, he said, after exports dropped in June. What is hurting German exports currently, is the uncertainty, which has spread across the globe and has also paralysed many European economies. Brexit also plays a role for German exports. In the run-up to the March deadline, German exporters benefited significantly from UK stockpiling. Now, they are suffering from the hangover of the stockpiling party. In April and May, German exporters sold almost as much to Austria as to the UK. Looking ahead, the outlook for German exporters is clearly in the hands of the US and China. Not only regarding the ongoing conflict but also regarding a possible conflict between the US and the EU, with President Trump already joking about tariffs on cars, and future trends in the Chinese market for automotives. WPP is the biggest riser on the on the FTSE 100, up by 7% today after it reported better than expected results. Boss Mark Read has launched a three-year plan to put the business back on track, after it lost clients following the departure of Martin Sorrell, who turned it into a FTSE 100 company. Via Reuters: WPP reported a better-than-expected organic sales performance in the second quarter as its new strategy under boss Mark Read helped the world\u2019s biggest advertising group to win new business and retain clients. The British company said on Friday organic growth less pass-through costs, its key sales measurement, dropped by 1.4% in the second quarter, an improvement on the first three months of down 2.8% and against a consensus of down 3%. The FTSE 100 in London has lost 0.2%, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose by 0.3%. Germany\u2019s Dax index fell 0.4% at the open. Italy\u2019s main stock market index in Milan has slumped after deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini called for new elections that would finally end the fragile coalition between his League and the Five Star Movement. The FTSE MIB fell by 1.6% in early trading, as investors prepared for yet another round of uncertainty in one of the Eurozone\u2019s largest economies. Italian banks fell by 2.7%, the lowest since June 2018. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, markets and economics in the UK and the Eurozone. And welcome to GDP day in the UK. After a whipsaw start to the week on global markets thanks to US President Donald Trump\u2019s attack on alleged \u201ccurrency manipulation\u201d by China, things settled down into a more normal August pattern of fairly muted moves later in the week. Today, however, all eyes will be on the 9:30am BST health check for the British economy in the second quarter. The economists\u2019 consensus expectations for the GDP growth rate point to... nothing. If the forecasts are to be believed growth will come in at 0%, meaning output was the same in the second quarter as in the first. That would represent the worst economic performance since the final quarter of 2012, when GDP shrank by 0.2%. It comes after an unexpected bounceback in the first three months of 2019, when the expansion hit 0.5%. Whatever the reading, it will be seized upon in the political realm immediately, amid an already febrile environment as Boris Johnson aims his fledgling government for a no-deal Brexit. That threat is thought to be the major factor behind British economic weakness in recent months, as uncertainty prevents businesses from making major spending decisions. That is thought to be particularly the case in the manufacturing sector. Economists on average believe the sector shrank by 1.1% in the year to July, with out-of-season shutdowns in the car sector a big factor. Yesterday Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the UK\u2019s most senior civil servant to intervene to stop Boris Johnson forcing a no-deal Brexit in the middle of an election campaign, amid rising signs the country is heading for the polls again this autumn. This all comes amid a difficult time for our biggest trading partners as well. Alongside the aforementioned trade war between the US and China, the Eurozone economy is struggling as the German industrial powerhouse stutters. German trade figures this morning just added to weak picture from the eurozone\u2019s largest economy. German exports dropped by 0.1% month-on-month in June, from 1.3% growth during May. On the year, exports were down by a painful 8%.

      "bodyText": "Ever since he first arrived at Chelsea, bursting on to the scene like a labrador puppy at a family gathering unsure of whose face to lick, whose leg to gnaw, which plate of sausage rolls to attack first, David Luiz has had a reputation in England for going walkabout. David Luiz makes the wrong move. David Luiz is in the wrong place. David Luiz appears to be fundamentally confused, head out, chest puffed, galloping off towards the wrong part of the world entirely. In this context it seems inevitable, a matter of destiny, that David Luiz should have found his way to the centre of the Arsenal defence. This is of course a cheap joke; a cheap joke that is, like all the best cheap jokes, unfunny because it\u2019s also untrue but there are plenty of confusing and divisive things about David Luiz\u2019s move from Chelsea to Arsenal on transfer deadline day. Getting David Luiz wrong: English football has been doing this for a while now. For now the most notable part of David Luiz\u2019s move across London is the familiar wave of scepticism, the snarky chuckles, the idea floated around that Arsenal\u2019s mop-haired defensive stroller has been overpriced and overvalued throughout his career; that he lacks good sense, spatial awareness, steel in the trenches and all the rest of it. There is an obvious point of confusion here. On the one hand we have an acknowledged flake, chancer and gadabout. On the other a defender who has strengthened every team that signed him; who was a kind of clown-shoed Virgil van Dijk for Antonio Conte\u2019s title-winning Chelsea two years ago; and who has in terms of style and impact been one of the most influential overseas defenders in the Premier League. Someone is getting football wrong here. It might not be the bloke with league title medals in three countries and a world-record combined career transfer fee for a defender. One thing is clear. David Luiz is a wonderful signing for Arsenal, even aged 32 and with almost 600 games on the clock. This shouldn\u2019t need saying but in a way Gary Neville did him a favour with those famous comments about resembling a PlayStation player controlled by a child. Neville was referring to a specific performance in a specific game but it was a funny line and it stuck, planting the idea of a player who could be consistently underrated, mocked for his foibles and for his progressive intent. We mock David Luiz because his failures are so often spectacularly cinematic. Against Spurs at Wembley last year he didn\u2019t just fail to tackle Son Heung-min, he dematerialised completely and winked back into existence doing something different on the other side of the pitch, breakdancing, cooking an omelette, rewiring a plug. We mock David Luiz because when he makes these mistakes he looks so sad and noble in the TV close-up reaction shots, like a plucky orphan child in a Disney adventure whose best friend is a streetwise duck. Meanwhile beyond all this the real David Luiz has made two errors leading directly to a goal in his entire Premier League career. Last season 93 defenders were dispossessed more often than the league\u2019s top-ranked goofball. Only two made more passes. Three years ago he shifted his game to become the deep playmaker in a three-man defence who drove Chelsea\u2019s last league title win. Last year it was his brilliant drilled crossfield V2 bomb pass at Stamford Bridge that set Manchester City en route to a defeat that might have derailed that brilliant team. Risk and reward. Adaptability. Unconventional lines and angles. In many ways David Luiz is a kind of litmus test for insularity, for the idea that leaders can\u2019t have floppy hair and romp about like a triumphant pedigree pantomime horse; or that there is only one kind of sporting bravery and it doesn\u2019t involve taking imaginative risks or sucking up your own errors and continuing to play it the same way. The emergence of any young English defender with the ability to pass the ball tends to generate a whisper of solemn excitement. Meanwhile David Luiz is already out there: a clown, a joke, a human error message, and a leader in a more basic sense. His penalty in the 2012 Champions League final remains an outstanding moment in Chelsea\u2019s modern history, the ball thumped with such furious will into the top corner you felt the game, the day, rearranging itself around him. In the aftermath of a horrendous showing in that 7-1 meltdown against Germany at the 2014 World Cup it was easy to forget David Luiz had led that blubbing, weeping Brazil team to the semi-finals by the hairs on its neck.

She had a big success at the 1853 Paris Salon with the original of this thunderous picture, which is now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The fact that the National Gallery has owned this smaller version since 1859 shows how she broke into the forefront of contemporary art in the Victorian age. These horses are infused with fury and electric passion. They are being sold but they have wildness and freedom rippling through every rearing and hoof-stamping fibre of their being. \u2022 National Gallery, London Image of the week Tintagel Castle Footbridge, Cornwall, by Ney+Partners and William Matthews Associates King Arthur\u2019s supposed birthplace will be easier for visitors to reach now a striking bridge spans the Cornish cliffs from which it stretches.

The 251-run defeat suffered at Edgbaston was always likely to prompt a change and so it came as no surprise on Friday afternoon when Ed Smith\u2019s selectors, already missing the injured Jimmy Anderson, announced that Moeen was the player being left out for Wednesday\u2019s Test. While the 32-year-old had enjoyed a strong 12 months since returning to the side last summer, he lost his place in the one-day team midway through the seamer-dominated World Cup and his performance in Birmingham pointed to a cricketer low on confidence. Two failures with the bat at the hands of his regular tormentor, Nathan Lyon, might not have been terminal had the bowling which returned 45 wickets from his nine previous Tests been on show. But with no red-ball cricket to speak of since the winter tour to the Caribbean \u2013 bar the seam-dominated Ireland Test that saw him send down only three overs \u2013 Moeen struggled to contain and appeared to be battling with his bowling action throughout. In Leach, who lit up the Ireland Test match with a battling 92 from nightwatchman but found himself similarly redundant with the ball, England are clearly asking a lot. Steve Smith\u2019s twin centuries drove them to distraction at Edgbaston and while it is true that left-arm finger spinners have found a way past his defence, Leach, like Moeen is low on recent cricket by way of relevance. The domestic schedule, rather than the World Cup, is to blame.

Test cricket has long been touted as potentially being the 24-year-old\u2019s best format \u2013 131 first-class wickets from just 28 matches for Sussex tells you why \u2013 and Joe Root, who struggled with a four-man attack after Anderson went down early at Edgbaston, will welcome the additional firepower he brings. Certainly Hashim Amla, Colin de Grandomme and Alex Carey will all testify to the threat of Archer\u2019s venomous short-ball \u2013 delivered from close in to the stumps and with no discernible change of action \u2013 after all three were struck on the head by him during the World Cup. With fast bowler Olly Stone also out with a back injury, Sam Curran is the spare man in the reduced 12-man squad. There is, however, some thought that England may be considering his additional all-round skills at the expense of a specialist batsman.

But with Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow not guaranteed to deliver amid talk of post-World Cup fatigue and low scores in the first Test, it may be considered too great a risk. One player who will not feature again this summer is Adil Rashid, who has now been ruled out of the remainder of Yorkshire\u2019s season with the chronic shoulder problem that required injections during the World Cup.

On Friday, Le Parisien newspaper reported that the former head of France\u2019s intelligence service Yves Bonnet had admitted negotiating a \u201csecret deal\u201d with the terrorist group. Now 83, Bonnet is said to have told investigators that he agreed the group\u2019s members could continue travelling to France if they carried out no more attacks on French soil. \u201cWe made a kind of verbal deal in which I said I don\u2019t want any more attacks on French soil and in return I\u2019ll let you come to France and I guarantee nothing will happen to you,\u201d Bonnet reportedly said in an interview with investigating magistrates in January. \u201cAnd it worked. There were no further attacks between the end of 1983 and the end of 1985 \u2026 afterwards, they carried out attacks in Italy, for example, but that did not concern me as long as there was nothing on French soil.\u201d Bonnet claimed the then French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s chief of staff was informed of the deal, but that \u201cofficially \u2026 the \u00c9lys\u00e9e knew nothing\u201d. Investigators, also kept in the dark over the deal, have asked to interview other members of the intelligence services who have refused to speak until now, claiming it was a matter of national security. Yohann Ta\u00efeb, the president of the support committee representing victims\u2019 families, said that, if confirmed, Bonnet\u2019s admission was \u201cshameful\u201d. He called on Macron to \u201cdeclassify documents and take decisions about eventual legal proceedings\u201d. Avi Bitton, a lawyer for the families, told Le Parisien: \u201cWe need a parliamentary inquiry not just on the rue des Rosiers attack but to establish if such secret pacts were sealed with other terrorist organisations.\u201d Lawyers representing the families have also demanded the extradition of four suspects currently in Jordan and Norway.",

I will always be stronger than the cancer cell \u2013 cos I need to live.\u201d She needed to live for her two sons. Her relationship with their father had broken down partly due to phone-hacking, another feature of those times. It is brave of Channel 4 to broadcast this now, for it is impossible not to see its own producers as culpable \u2013 not just for her rise but for her fall. Goody\u2019s legacy, for a while, was more young women getting screened for cancer, but rates have since fallen again. In 2014, her mother was told her benefits would be cut: \u201cThey said I ain\u2019t dead, I ain\u2019t blind, I can walk and I use my right hand so I\u2019m not disabled no more.\u201d Class will win out. Goody had gulped up every minute of her time. We sat there watching her fall as though we were outside it, rather than part of it. We bemoaned the fact that kids want to be famous for the sake of being famous, yet we know social mobility is in decline. We crave celebrity and we then want to punish those who achieve it. Goody embodied a shame-and-blame culture around class, race and female desire. She was destroyed by that, as well as cancer. Her funeral was televised. Of course it was. That final public act, though: the white wedding dress, no veil to cover her head, no hiding what was happening to her. It was an image that defied every fairytale going. It was as real as it gets. I don\u2019t know if she knew what she was doing. I like to think she did. \u2022 Episode two of Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain is on Channel 4 at 9pm on 14 August.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biggest exam board has confirmed that 78 students have had their exam results withheld following a leak of an A-level maths paper this summer. The security breach, which happened before tens of thousands of students sat an Edexcel maths paper on 14 June, prompted uproar among candidates concerned they would be at an unfair disadvantage. With A-level exam results due to be published next Thursday, Edexcel\u2019s parent company, Pearson, said that all of the maths papers had been reviewed in detail to ensure that candidates got a fair grade that reflected their work. Exam security has become a problem in recent years, with smartphones and social media enabling cheats to disseminate leaked questions quickly, causing huge stress among students every summer. Such is the level of concern that a review of exam malpractice is under way and is due to report this summer. At the time of the maths A-level breach, Pearson said just two questions, which were heavily blacked out, had been circulated on Twitter before the exam, which went ahead amid speculation that the breach had in fact been more widespread. On Friday, the company confirmed that the entire paper had been shared by a number of students on a closed social media network before the exam was sat. \u201cBased on the evidence available to us at that point we had to decide quickly whether or not to replace the paper or reschedule the exam,\u201d said Sharon Hague, Pearson\u2019s senior vice-president for schools. \u201cIt was too late to replace papers and rescheduling would have caused significant additional stress and disruption for tens of thousands of students across the country.

The 78 students at the heart of the investigation are having their results withheld while the board\u2019s malpractice procedures are completed. Pearson also addressed widespread complaints from students and teachers that the second Edexcel A-level maths paper sat this summer was too hard.

      "bodyText": "A crucial climate change conference expected to be co-hosted by the UK would take place in Glasgow, the government has announced, in a move that will be seen as trying to dampen pro-independence sentiment in Scotland. The UK is bidding to host COP26, the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), alongside Italy. If successful, scores of world leaders and as many as 30,000 delegates would attend the summit in Glasgow over two weeks at the end of 2020, with other events held in Italy. The two countries had been competing to hold the event, but have joined forces and are expected to be formally named as co-hosts in December. COP26 is seen as a crucial next step in international efforts to tackle the climate crisis, the most significant UN climate summit since the Paris deal was struck in 2015, when countries pledged to curb emissions. The programme would be based at the Scottish Event Campus conference centre, with some events taking part elsewhere around the UK, a Cabinet Office announcement said. The decision to select Glasgow will be viewed as a sop to Scottish unionist sentiment, which has been strained as expectations grow that the UK could be heading for a no-deal Brexit. A poll this week found a majority of Scots would now vote yes in a new independence referendum, and the country\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she will push for another poll. Claire Perry, the Conservative MP who was moved from energy minister by Boris Johnson to lead the COP26 bid, said: \u201cAs one of the UK\u2019s most sustainable cities, with a record for hosting high-profile international events, Glasgow is the right choice to showcase the UK\u2019s commitment to the environment.\u201d The government has said the event would be the largest summit ever hosted in the UK, with as many as 200 world leaders expected on the final weekend. Dr Alison Doig, Christian Aid\u2019s head of policy who was born in Glasgow and chairs the group that coordinates UK NGOs\u2019 engagement with the government, said: \u201cHosting the UN climate summit is a huge responsibility, as we are already seeing the very real impacts of the climate crisis. \u201cWith record temperatures in the UK and across Europe recently, devastating floods in Mozambique and India, and weather extremes causing havoc in other parts of the world, it will be up to the UK\u2019s diplomatic skills and influence to ensure the Glasgow summit delivers a positive and urgent outcome for the planet. \u201cThe two priorities need to be that countries commit to work together to achieve rapid emissions reductions, and that vulnerable countries and people already suffering from the damaging effects of climate change are provided the financial support to help them adapt and prosper.\u201d",

The knives were then sent to a residential address.</p> \n<p>It is the job of councils\u2019 local trading standards departments to enforce knife sales laws, while the onus for verifying buyers\u2019 ages on Facebook ultimately lies with the individual sellers \u2013 often members of the public \u2013 in the absence of a regulated age-checking system.</p> \n<p>A wide selection of culinary knives are available on the social media site, including nine-inch cleaving knives, as well as a limited number of non-culinary knives which are not allowed to be sold on the platform.</p> \n<p>Facebook said it worked quickly to remove any such items, and invited the Guardian to highlight adverts which did not conform to its policy. It subsequently removed one item, a culinary Damascus steel chef knife which came with a free non-culinary knife.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe take safety very seriously, which is why you have to be 18 or older to use Facebook Marketplace,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe do not allow the sale of non-culinary knives on Marketplace and work quickly to remove these items.\u201d</p> \n<p>Facebook ascertains the age of its users by asking people to provide their date of birth. It recognised it could do more to ensure children could not access inappropriate content.</p> \n<p>Patrick Green, the chief executive of the Ben Kinsella Trust, said retailers had age checks which could not be circumvented and that Facebook and its online marketplace had a legal and moral responsibility to keep knives \u201cout of the hands\u201d of young people.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout the need to employ much subterfuge to disguise their age, large knives can be purchased from this site and delivered without robust checks taking place,\u201d he said. \u201cFacebook not only have a moral duty to bring this site up to standard, but a legal one too.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Home Office said it was an offence to sell any bladed article to a person under 18 and that the Offensive Weapons Act, which passed into law in May, bans online sellers from sending knives to residential addresses unless age verification checks are in place.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/13/knife-and-offensive-weapon-offences-england-wales-reach-highest-level-for-decade\">Knife and offensive weapon offences reach highest level for decade</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt is totally unacceptable for social media companies to allow the illegal sale of weapons on their platforms and they must do more to stop this practice, as well as reporting it to the police,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe are making it harder than ever for young people to purchase knives, including online.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the Home Office has supported \u201cenforcement activity\u201d in more than 1,000 cases of physical retailers selling knives to children, it said the laws around everyday knife sales were for trading standards departments to enforce.</p> \n<p>National Trading Standards (NTS) has urged retailers and online marketplaces to strengthen their approach to illegal weapon sales. It said that local trading standards departments were ultimately responsible for policing the sales.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur findings from a new programme of test purchasing has identified a number of retailers selling knives without undertaking required age verifications,\u201d a spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe programme, which is funded by the Home Office and started in October 2018, has revealed a 41% failure rate among online retailers. Enforcement action is ongoing, so we can neither name retailers who failed the checks or comment on potential enforcement measures at this time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Conservative MP Ross Thomson, an officer with the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on knife crime, called for the government and police to urgently investigate any evidence that knives were being sold illegally on Facebook.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is little point in passing legislation if it is not being upheld,\u201d he said. \u201cFacebook must be challenged on the ease with which people are able to purchase these items online.\u201d</p> \n<p> Recently drafted government legislation has proposed the establishment of an independent regulator to hold online companies to account over the sale of illegal goods and make them more responsible for children\u2019s safety online.</p> \n<p>A number of high street and online retailers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/05/co-op-curbs-sale-of-knives-in-response-to-rising\">restricted access to knives in their stores</a>, or stopped selling them altogether, as knife crime surges across the UK, particularly in London.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6c758905-3a7a-4925-b267-b97623d5ed61\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7e04GdftNbo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Knives can be purchased on Facebook Marketplace without age verification despite a recent law requiring checks, the Guardian can reveal. In May, the UK government made it illegal to send knives sold on the internet and elsewhere to homes without ensuring the buyer was over 18 as part of reforms to strengthen existing legislation. However, the Guardian was able to purchase four sets of knives from sellers on Facebook Marketplace without age checks. The knives were then sent to a residential address. It is the job of councils\u2019 local trading standards departments to enforce knife sales laws, while the onus for verifying buyers\u2019 ages on Facebook ultimately lies with the individual sellers \u2013 often members of the public \u2013 in the absence of a regulated age-checking system. A wide selection of culinary knives are available on the social media site, including nine-inch cleaving knives, as well as a limited number of non-culinary knives which are not allowed to be sold on the platform. Facebook said it worked quickly to remove any such items, and invited the Guardian to highlight adverts which did not conform to its policy. It subsequently removed one item, a culinary Damascus steel chef knife which came with a free non-culinary knife. \u201cWe take safety very seriously, which is why you have to be 18 or older to use Facebook Marketplace,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe do not allow the sale of non-culinary knives on Marketplace and work quickly to remove these items.\u201d Facebook ascertains the age of its users by asking people to provide their date of birth. It recognised it could do more to ensure children could not access inappropriate content. Patrick Green, the chief executive of the Ben Kinsella Trust, said retailers had age checks which could not be circumvented and that Facebook and its online marketplace had a legal and moral responsibility to keep knives \u201cout of the hands\u201d of young people. \u201cWithout the need to employ much subterfuge to disguise their age, large knives can be purchased from this site and delivered without robust checks taking place,\u201d he said. \u201cFacebook not only have a moral duty to bring this site up to standard, but a legal one too.\u201d The Home Office said it was an offence to sell any bladed article to a person under 18 and that the Offensive Weapons Act, which passed into law in May, bans online sellers from sending knives to residential addresses unless age verification checks are in place. \u201cIt is totally unacceptable for social media companies to allow the illegal sale of weapons on their platforms and they must do more to stop this practice, as well as reporting it to the police,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe are making it harder than ever for young people to purchase knives, including online.\u201d Although the Home Office has supported \u201cenforcement activity\u201d in more than 1,000 cases of physical retailers selling knives to children, it said the laws around everyday knife sales were for trading standards departments to enforce. National Trading Standards (NTS) has urged retailers and online marketplaces to strengthen their approach to illegal weapon sales. It said that local trading standards departments were ultimately responsible for policing the sales. \u201cOur findings from a new programme of test purchasing has identified a number of retailers selling knives without undertaking required age verifications,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe programme, which is funded by the Home Office and started in October 2018, has revealed a 41% failure rate among online retailers. Enforcement action is ongoing, so we can neither name retailers who failed the checks or comment on potential enforcement measures at this time.\u201d The Conservative MP Ross Thomson, an officer with the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on knife crime, called for the government and police to urgently investigate any evidence that knives were being sold illegally on Facebook. \u201cThere is little point in passing legislation if it is not being upheld,\u201d he said. \u201cFacebook must be challenged on the ease with which people are able to purchase these items online.\u201d Recently drafted government legislation has proposed the establishment of an independent regulator to hold online companies to account over the sale of illegal goods and make them more responsible for children\u2019s safety online. A number of high street and online retailers have restricted access to knives in their stores, or stopped selling them altogether, as knife crime surges across the UK, particularly in London.",

In a move that piles pressure on the Dublin-based carrier, members of Ialpa voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action, with the union citing widespread anger at the stagnation of pay negotiations with the airline. F\u00f3rsa, an umbrella union that includes Ialpa, said industrial action was backed by 94% of the 180 pilots who were directly employed, meaning they were eligible to vote, unlike the many Ryanair pilots employed through third-party agencies. The union, which is required to give at least one week\u2019s notice before any strike under Irish law, will write to management early next week to outline its plans if the pay demands are not met. Ian McDonnell, the assistant general secretary of F\u00f3rsa, said strikes could be avoided if management at the airline changed their attitude to labour relations, which had been fractious for some time. He accused the airline of stalling tactics in negotiations, during which it had asked the union to estimate the cost of its demands and then failed to provide the information necessary to make the calculations. \u201cRyanair\u2019s directly employed Irish-based pilots are simply seeking pay levels that are common and competitive in the commercial airline sector, from a company that made a more-than-healthy profit of \u20ac1bn (\u00a3930m) last year,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThey feel they have been forced into contemplating potentially disruptive industrial action by a company that seems either unwilling or unable to negotiate in a professional and constructive manner. \u201cAt this stage, only a substantive counter-proposal, which properly addresses all areas of our claim, will be enough to prevent us serving notice of industrial action next week.\u201d The Guardian has approached Ryanair for comment. Ryanair was already facing the prospect of five days of disruption in late August and early September after talks to avert strike action by UK-based pilots broke down.

      "body": "<p>A snapshot of the conversations I have with Londoners about art beyond the boundaries of their city would include such statements as: \u201cI have never thought to visit an exhibition outside London\u201d; \u201cHow far is it from London?\u201d and (in a particularly sour exchange about a show in Yorkshire) \u201cThat\u2019s a shame\u201d. The Freelands Foundation must have caught wind of this pervasive London-centric attitude when it launched a programme that funds artists and galleries outside the capital. G39 in Cardiff, PS\u00b2 in Belfast, Site Gallery in Sheffield and Talbot Rice Gallery in Edinburgh received a total of \u00a31.5m to support emerging artists, inviting them to develop new work and a network of contacts that will hopefully see them thrive in the city they call home.</p> <p>Halfway into the first two-year residencies, Site Gallery opens Platform 2019, a works-in-progress exhibition offering a sneak preview of the practices of the six artists they are nurturing.

Williams\u2019 full-height woven foil curtains dazzle, evoking a childlike joy when rustled; Street\u2019s interviews with members of the trans community are all the more engaging when inserted into a Tamagotchi-style device to be \u201cplayed\u201d, and Vann\u2019s short videos of her everyday life are as entrancing as they would be on Instagram.</p> <p>But there is a lot of space in this room, a huge number of strides to be made between Street\u2019s sinister Victorian pram and Vann\u2019s little iPhone with only two sets of headphones. On the wall, names from Donna Harraway\u2019s scholarly article Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Plantationocene, Chthulucene: Making Kin are projected on a blank sheet of white paper. Street tells me it is a cyber-Bayeux Tapestry \u2013 this sounds spectacular, but I can\u2019t tell whether it is finished or not.</p> <p>Down the road at Bloc Projects, Carr\u2019s cinematic photographs of northern theatres mesmerise. The familiar rows of luxurious velvet seating, the draped curtains and gold-painted detailing are captivating through Carr\u2019s colour-soaked lens. Each image focuses on the staircase that leads to the stage \u2013 a bridge between reality and creativity, especially for women.

      "bodyText": "A snapshot of the conversations I have with Londoners about art beyond the boundaries of their city would include such statements as: \u201cI have never thought to visit an exhibition outside London\u201d; \u201cHow far is it from London?\u201d and (in a particularly sour exchange about a show in Yorkshire) \u201cThat\u2019s a shame\u201d. The Freelands Foundation must have caught wind of this pervasive London-centric attitude when it launched a programme that funds artists and galleries outside the capital. G39 in Cardiff, PS\u00b2 in Belfast, Site Gallery in Sheffield and Talbot Rice Gallery in Edinburgh received a total of \u00a31.5m to support emerging artists, inviting them to develop new work and a network of contacts that will hopefully see them thrive in the city they call home. Halfway into the first two-year residencies, Site Gallery opens Platform 2019, a works-in-progress exhibition offering a sneak preview of the practices of the six artists they are nurturing. The showcase spans two other nearby galleries for a mini-takeover of Sheffield; Site hosts Zoyander Street, Si\u00e2n Williams and Lucy Vann, while Bloc Projects houses Alison J Carr and Yorkshire Artspace takes Yuen Fong Ling. With the largest space, Site has the hardest job of transforming half-formed artistic thoughts into a vivacious presentation of confident voices and intriguing visuals with the impact necessary to fill its gigantic white box. It is partially successful. Williams\u2019 full-height woven foil curtains dazzle, evoking a childlike joy when rustled; Street\u2019s interviews with members of the trans community are all the more engaging when inserted into a Tamagotchi-style device to be \u201cplayed\u201d, and Vann\u2019s short videos of her everyday life are as entrancing as they would be on Instagram. But there is a lot of space in this room, a huge number of strides to be made between Street\u2019s sinister Victorian pram and Vann\u2019s little iPhone with only two sets of headphones. On the wall, names from Donna Harraway\u2019s scholarly article Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Plantationocene, Chthulucene: Making Kin are projected on a blank sheet of white paper. Street tells me it is a cyber-Bayeux Tapestry \u2013 this sounds spectacular, but I can\u2019t tell whether it is finished or not. Down the road at Bloc Projects, Carr\u2019s cinematic photographs of northern theatres mesmerise. The familiar rows of luxurious velvet seating, the draped curtains and gold-painted detailing are captivating through Carr\u2019s colour-soaked lens. Each image focuses on the staircase that leads to the stage \u2013 a bridge between reality and creativity, especially for women. She who climbs it may have a moment of artistic freedom, she is to return to her expected role. This final stop is Ling\u2019s \u201cshoe shop\u201d at Yorkshire Artspace. Towards Memorial is a celebration of the life of Edward Carpenter, a socialist writer, poet and activist who lived openly with his partner just outside Sheffield when homosexuality was still illegal in the UK. Carpenter was criticised by George Orwell for being a \u201csandal-wearing lefty\u201d so \u2013 on finding the original pattern for Carpenter\u2019s sandals in an archive \u2013 Ling commissioned a local shoemaker to recreate several pairs for The Friends of Edward Carpenter. The immaculately crafted sandals line up next to videos of activism in Sheffield and photographic prints of Carpenter that Ling has inserted in his own shoes and moulded to the shape of his feet. Towards Memorial is the most developed of these works. Ling\u2019s mixed-media presentation, which mines Sheffield\u2019s history for inspiration and utilises the skills of local artisans, is presumably just what the Freelands Foundation was hoping for.

There\u2019s also this weird strain of liberal racism where people believe they\u2019re so liberal that they couldn\u2019t possibly be racist \u2013 at another festival I had a woman describe me as \u201ca little bit namaste\u201d.

I applied for comedy spots with two names, my real name and an anglicised one, with an identical comedy CV and routine; 81% of comedy promoters booked me with the anglicised name, but only 12% did with my real name. I\u2019ve also been told before by directors that I shouldn\u2019t talk too much about ethnicity in my comedy because it will ruin my chances of success. <em>Jenan Younis, 28, performer, London</em></p> <h2>\u2018You\u2019re fighting an uphill battle if you\u2019re doing something different\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve heard other BAME acts talk about how their friends don\u2019t even come up to Edinburgh because of the associated costs. The fringe is definitely skewed towards wealthier people who might not be from a BAME background, and so you\u2019re fighting an uphill battle if you\u2019re doing something for a more varied audience. Personally I haven\u2019t experienced any racism at the fringe, but I still think what Fringe of Colour is doing is fantastic \u2013 if only there was a way they could eliminate the transport and hotel costs since they\u2019re likely the biggest inhibitor stopping young BAME people from going up to the fringe. <em>Arnab Chanda</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9db637d157c9849b2382bbd8c24fb5cb7810d17f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9db637d157c9849b2382bbd8c24fb5cb7810d17f/0_219_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"4 BROWN GIRLS WHO WRITE\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poetry collective, 4 BROWN GIRLS WHO WRITE: Roshni Goyate, Sharan Hunjan, Sunnah Khan, and Sheena Patel</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alia Romagnoli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018We need spaces with performances by and for people of colour\u2019</h2> <p>Our poetry collective, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/4browngirlswhowrite/?hl=en\">4 BROWN GIRLS WHO WRITE</a>, did a five-day run at the fringe with three sell-out shows. We felt that it was important to create a space for performers of colour. Both our white and non-white audience members felt empowered by the stories and voices on our stage and we even had one white member of the audience tell us that the show had helped her reflect on her privilege. We received a great response from our audiences who said there weren\u2019t any shows like ours. We were there to creatively challenge the audience through our collective vulnerability of what it\u2019s like to be \u201cothered\u201d \u2013 and people were welcoming of the space we created. <em>4 Brown Girls Who Write, performers and poets, London</em></p> <h2>\u2018I love the fringe, but the subtle ignorance is tiring\u2019</h2> <p>I love the fringe and want to keep going every year, but sometimes the subtle ignorance can get tiring. As a hijab-wearing Muslim, people handing out flyers for shows don\u2019t approach me but instead give flyers to my white, non-hijab wearing friends. At comedy shows I\u2019ve gotten used to comedians never trying to begin a conversation with me, no matter how many times I sit in the front row, and at bars I find people staring at me before quickly looking away.

However, as an Indian woman and a creative, I hate how invisible BAME work and artists are made, through lack of access to high-profile showcases, press coverage and reviews. It can be a breeze for some BAME people but for most of us it\u2019s not about our art, it\u2019s about physical and mental stamina.

      "body": "<p>Let\u2019s get this out the way, shall we? Sergio Busquets. There, that\u2019s that done. In a world where everyone is the \u201cNew Someone\u201d, and certain players define roles for others to follow, maybe comparisons are inevitable; but in the case of Rodrigo Hern\u00e1ndez, the midfielder Pep Guardiola bought from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid this summer, and Busquets, the one he first brought on in the third division against Banyoles aged 19 more than a decade ago, it feels even more unavoidable. Perhaps, then, this signing was inevitable too. Some footballers are supposed to be in particular places.</p> <p>At times it seems impossible to mention Rodri without mentioning Busquets, the man whose role he is ready to inherit with Spain and under Guardiola. Some are now suggesting there could be even more to him than that. It is the role that, somehow, he always knew he would play, and if last season he didn\u2019t, at least not exactly, that was because there were other things he wanted to master first, other qualities to develop, lessons to learn. It was also the main reason he did eventually depart. Rodri wants to play, his way.</p> <p>And everyone keeps saying his way is Busquets\u2019s way, Pep\u2019s way.</p> <p>\u201cRodri could fit perfectly at Manchester City because their coach has an Ajax and Barcelona style, the same idea. City have a coach with Barcelona influences; Rodri has the ability and the qualities to play that way,\u201d Luis Milla said in the summer. Brought through La Masia, Milla was the central midfielder who Johan Cruyff eventually replaced with Guardiola. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad swap for them,\u201d he laughs. He was also Spain\u2019s Under-21 coach, a role in which he remained committed to those footballing ideals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-spending-jurgen-klopp\">\u2018It bothers me\u2019: Guardiola defends Man City\u2019s spending after Klopp\u2019s jibe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Albert Celades is another former Under-21 manager with Spain, another central midfielder from that same era and that same mould, a Barcelona youth product who made the first team in 1995. He gave Rodri his U-21 debut. \u201cFor someone of his size he is very quick with both feet, making him able to bring the ball out when under pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cHe does difficult things with simplicity. Like Busquets, he has that intuition that allows him to be well-positioned, to know where a move is going so he\u2019s there to take the ball.\u201d</p> <p>Busquets, always Busquets. Yet the line of continuity breaks: Rodri has never been at Barcelona. He began his career at Atl\u00e9tico but was released at 17, partly because of his size and partly because of a change in management in the youth system. He was small then, a late developer, but a growth spurt followed fast; he is 6ft 3in now. He went to Villarreal where the priority is possession and positioning. He lived in a students\u2019 residence and studied business. They called him Bruno Xiquet \u2013 Little Bruno. Bruno Soriano was the club\u2019s captain, a deep-lying central midfielder of control, passing and tranquillity \u2013 the closest thing there was to, yes, Busquets.</p> <p>Born on the day Spain lost to England at Euro 96, Rodri identified with Guardiola\u2019s \u201cinnovative\u201d Barcelona side and the Spanish national team during childhood, though his idol was Zidane. \u201cIn 2008 I was watching Marcos Senna and Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Santi Cazorla: they were the ones that imposed that winning style on the team, a style which evolved and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/11/world-cup-final-holland-spain1\" title=\"\">won Spain the World Cup</a> and another Euros,\u201d he said. \u201cI watched Busquets especially closely. He, and others, lay down a model of playing I knew I had to follow.\u201d</p> <p>So he did, closely. As he played he examined, questioned, debated. His Under-12 coach recalled in-depth tactical discussions: \u201cThat\u2019s not normal in a boy his age,\u201d Fran Alcoy says. \u201cHe was very sharp tactically; it was striking that you could tell him something and you wouldn\u2019t need to explain it again. You could see he would be superlative. I had never coached a player like it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a2242d12ef67a29ea377547415c9051a56fcbd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a2242d12ef67a29ea377547415c9051a56fcbd2/0_49_3500_2297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rodri and Lionel Messi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodri battles for possession with Lionel Messi during Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s La Liga contest with Barcelona at the Wanda Metropolitano last season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hanna/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rodri told Ladislao Monino in El Pa\u00eds: \u201cWhen I was a kid, I was more interested in understanding football than enjoying it. I was interested in how it worked. I watched a lot of games \u2013 my family was sick of it \u2013 and I could judge if a player was thinking. I tried to add that to my game; I could see that if I understood the game I would have an advantage, especially at a young age when few players have that conceptual understanding.\u201d</p> <p>He described the central midfielder\u2019s role as being about positioning, fluidity, playing passes that \u201cbreak the lines\u201d. <em>Salida</em> is a word that is used about him often: the ability to play the ball out, to find a passageway from deep.</p> <p>In 2017-18 only Ivan Rakitic completed more passes in Spain, by 25 passes. Busquets was fourth, 198 passes behind him. At the end of that season, though, Rodri returned to Atl\u00e9tico. He cost only \u20ac25m and the fact that Barcelona did not move for him was a surprise: he was the obvious man to oversee a transition, the perfect replacement. This spring they did make enquiries but it was too late: his new buy-out clause was set at \u20ac70m and he was by then aware of the interest of City.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/manchester-city-pay-rodri-release-clause-atletico-madrid-transfer-window-football\">City's new \u00a362.8m signing Rodri says Manchester may be getting 'more blue'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Atl\u00e9tico may have appeared an unusual move for a player so defined by a style that appeared the polar opposite, but he could see the value. He was 22, still developing, aware of his limitations, aware of the shift in football. He was also convinced that he had the physique to bridge that gap, to become a hybrid. And, in Diego Simeone, that he had the man who could bring that other side out in him.</p> <p>At Atl\u00e9tico he proved that he could take a step up and also that he could adapt. All of which might have prepared him better for the Premier League, although he already saw a shift there, directly citing City (and only City) when he insisted last autumn: \u201cmore of that [Spanish] type of players are fitting in there and standing out; there are ever more players of talent.\u201d Last season at Atl\u00e9tico underlined the fact that he should have few problems if he decided to join them. He adapted, as he always thought he would. He had taken a conscious decision to be taken in a different direction, forced to develop.</p> <p>\u201c[Going to Atl\u00e9tico] is going to help me,\u201d he told the Guardian soon after arriving there. \u201cIt will complete me as a player.\u201d</p> <p>Rodri learned, broadened his game, changed. He performed so well that in one game when Simeone took him off, the coach was whistled \u2013 something that has never happened before. A public debate over style briefly opened and was quickly closed. And the man who played the second most passes in the league in 2017-18 became the man who completed more tackles than anyone else in 2018-19. But something was missing: 471 passes, for a start.</p> <p>Rodri felt he wanted something else, something more from the game. He wanted to play, the way he always had. And so, better now, more complete, more learned, he has gone somewhere where he thinks he can.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s get this out the way, shall we? Sergio Busquets. There, that\u2019s that done. In a world where everyone is the \u201cNew Someone\u201d, and certain players define roles for others to follow, maybe comparisons are inevitable; but in the case of Rodrigo Hern\u00e1ndez, the midfielder Pep Guardiola bought from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid this summer, and Busquets, the one he first brought on in the third division against Banyoles aged 19 more than a decade ago, it feels even more unavoidable. Perhaps, then, this signing was inevitable too. Some footballers are supposed to be in particular places. At times it seems impossible to mention Rodri without mentioning Busquets, the man whose role he is ready to inherit with Spain and under Guardiola. Some are now suggesting there could be even more to him than that. It is the role that, somehow, he always knew he would play, and if last season he didn\u2019t, at least not exactly, that was because there were other things he wanted to master first, other qualities to develop, lessons to learn. It was also the main reason he did eventually depart. Rodri wants to play, his way. And everyone keeps saying his way is Busquets\u2019s way, Pep\u2019s way. \u201cRodri could fit perfectly at Manchester City because their coach has an Ajax and Barcelona style, the same idea. City have a coach with Barcelona influences; Rodri has the ability and the qualities to play that way,\u201d Luis Milla said in the summer. Brought through La Masia, Milla was the central midfielder who Johan Cruyff eventually replaced with Guardiola. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad swap for them,\u201d he laughs. He was also Spain\u2019s Under-21 coach, a role in which he remained committed to those footballing ideals. Albert Celades is another former Under-21 manager with Spain, another central midfielder from that same era and that same mould, a Barcelona youth product who made the first team in 1995. He gave Rodri his U-21 debut. \u201cFor someone of his size he is very quick with both feet, making him able to bring the ball out when under pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cHe does difficult things with simplicity. Like Busquets, he has that intuition that allows him to be well-positioned, to know where a move is going so he\u2019s there to take the ball.\u201d Busquets, always Busquets. Yet the line of continuity breaks: Rodri has never been at Barcelona. He began his career at Atl\u00e9tico but was released at 17, partly because of his size and partly because of a change in management in the youth system. He was small then, a late developer, but a growth spurt followed fast; he is 6ft 3in now. He went to Villarreal where the priority is possession and positioning. He lived in a students\u2019 residence and studied business. They called him Bruno Xiquet \u2013 Little Bruno. Bruno Soriano was the club\u2019s captain, a deep-lying central midfielder of control, passing and tranquillity \u2013 the closest thing there was to, yes, Busquets. Born on the day Spain lost to England at Euro 96, Rodri identified with Guardiola\u2019s \u201cinnovative\u201d Barcelona side and the Spanish national team during childhood, though his idol was Zidane. \u201cIn 2008 I was watching Marcos Senna and Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Santi Cazorla: they were the ones that imposed that winning style on the team, a style which evolved and won Spain the World Cup and another Euros,\u201d he said. \u201cI watched Busquets especially closely. He, and others, lay down a model of playing I knew I had to follow.\u201d So he did, closely. As he played he examined, questioned, debated. His Under-12 coach recalled in-depth tactical discussions: \u201cThat\u2019s not normal in a boy his age,\u201d Fran Alcoy says. \u201cHe was very sharp tactically; it was striking that you could tell him something and you wouldn\u2019t need to explain it again. You could see he would be superlative. I had never coached a player like it.\u201d Rodri told Ladislao Monino in El Pa\u00eds: \u201cWhen I was a kid, I was more interested in understanding football than enjoying it. I was interested in how it worked. I watched a lot of games \u2013 my family was sick of it \u2013 and I could judge if a player was thinking. I tried to add that to my game; I could see that if I understood the game I would have an advantage, especially at a young age when few players have that conceptual understanding.\u201d He described the central midfielder\u2019s role as being about positioning, fluidity, playing passes that \u201cbreak the lines\u201d. Salida is a word that is used about him often: the ability to play the ball out, to find a passageway from deep. In 2017-18 only Ivan Rakitic completed more passes in Spain, by 25 passes. Busquets was fourth, 198 passes behind him. At the end of that season, though, Rodri returned to Atl\u00e9tico. He cost only \u20ac25m and the fact that Barcelona did not move for him was a surprise: he was the obvious man to oversee a transition, the perfect replacement. This spring they did make enquiries but it was too late: his new buy-out clause was set at \u20ac70m and he was by then aware of the interest of City. Atl\u00e9tico may have appeared an unusual move for a player so defined by a style that appeared the polar opposite, but he could see the value. He was 22, still developing, aware of his limitations, aware of the shift in football. He was also convinced that he had the physique to bridge that gap, to become a hybrid. And, in Diego Simeone, that he had the man who could bring that other side out in him. At Atl\u00e9tico he proved that he could take a step up and also that he could adapt. All of which might have prepared him better for the Premier League, although he already saw a shift there, directly citing City (and only City) when he insisted last autumn: \u201cmore of that [Spanish] type of players are fitting in there and standing out; there are ever more players of talent.\u201d Last season at Atl\u00e9tico underlined the fact that he should have few problems if he decided to join them. He adapted, as he always thought he would. He had taken a conscious decision to be taken in a different direction, forced to develop. \u201c[Going to Atl\u00e9tico] is going to help me,\u201d he told the Guardian soon after arriving there. \u201cIt will complete me as a player.\u201d Rodri learned, broadened his game, changed. He performed so well that in one game when Simeone took him off, the coach was whistled \u2013 something that has never happened before. A public debate over style briefly opened and was quickly closed. And the man who played the second most passes in the league in 2017-18 became the man who completed more tackles than anyone else in 2018-19. But something was missing: 471 passes, for a start. Rodri felt he wanted something else, something more from the game. He wanted to play, the way he always had. And so, better now, more complete, more learned, he has gone somewhere where he thinks he can.",

Was there frustration when the transfer window closed? \u201cIt was a great feeling of relief,\u201d he said, straight-batting another one away. \u201cNow it\u2019s done we\u2019re looking forward and I\u2019m delighted with the three we\u2019ve signed.\u201d As for the negative headlines and the general complaint that United\u2019s summer dealings are going to leave them considerably short of a title challenge, Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cThat\u2019s not the feeling inside the club and the feeling of the fans I\u2019ve met. There are always going to be fans out there wanting to sign players, that\u2019s part and parcel of being here. The players are here now and have been shown that trust that we believe in them. \u201cWe want to put that [negativity] right and the only way is by playing good football, showing the team we want to be, the style we want to play. Our fans, when they see that intention, have always been supporting the team. Within the team and the club we\u2019re feeling very confident and don\u2019t feel that negativity you\u2019re talking about.\u201d As for Lukaku, Solskj\u00e6r was asked about Gary Neville\u2019s comments that the Belgian had not acted professionally. \u201cIt was time for Rom to go because I think we got a good deal. He\u2019s happy, so I think both parties ended that deal as it should be. I have always had a good relationship with Rom, open and honest. We\u2019ve spoken to each other openly and frankly and there is no issue between me and Rom.\u201d",

Francesco Galietti, the founder of the Rome-based political consultancy Policy Sonar, said: \u201cThe crisis is now a fully fledged one and nobody, not even Mattarella, can put the genie back in the bottle. \u201cThe reality is that Salvini caught everyone by surprise, even his own people, but by doing so he\u2019s cornered Mattarella into a very nasty position.\u201d Parliament could be reconvened by 20 August to confirm the end of the administration. Elections would then have to be held within 50 to 70 days.",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s demand for oil is growing at the slowest rate since the financial crisis over fears of a global economic slowdown, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The agency said fears about the economic impact of the US trade war with China have caused oil prices to slide despite flaring tensions in the Middle East which would typically cause markets to spike. Oil demand growth almost halved in the first five months of the year compared with the same period last year, according to the IEA. Its latest monthly report revealed that demand grew by just under 600,000 barrels of oil a day this year, the weakest growth since 2008 when fears over the looming global recession caused demand growth to stall. Growth was almost solely driven by rising demand in China, where oil demand grew by 500,000 barrels a day. Meanwhile, oil demand across the OECD countries fell for the third consecutive quarter. \u201cThere have been concerns about the health of the global economy expressed in recent [IEA reports] and shown by reduced expectations for oil demand growth. Now, the situation is becoming even more uncertain,\u201d the IEA said. The Paris-based group added its outlook for future oil demand growth was \u201cfragile\u201d and more likely to fall again than to be revised upwards. The gloomy oil market forecasts come after global oil prices slumped this week amid rising US-China tensions, and signs the trade war may drag on. The oil price has tumbled by over 10% in recent weeks, from around $64 (\u00a353) a barrel at the end of July to less than $57 (\u00a347) a barrel this week. The market is down by almost a quarter from May when oil traded at almost $75 (\u00a362) a barrel. The oil price slide has come despite a tense standoff between Iran and the US in the strait of Hormuz in which Iran has reportedly seized three international oil tankers, and deep oil production cuts by the Opec Organisation. Saudi Arabia is leading plans to rein in oil output to avoid an oversupply in the market and further price falls. The IEA warned that by next year, rising oil supply output from non-Opec countries is expected to grow by 2.2m barrels a day in 2020, which could cause oil prices to fall further if there is not enough demand to absorb the extra supply. US investment bank Goldman Sachs has predicted that the US-China trade war could extend beyond the November 2020 US presidential election, as both sides toughened their stances this week. Beijing accused the US of \u201cdeliberately destroying international order\u201d with \u201cunilateralism and protectionism\u201d, just days after Washington accused China of acting as a currency manipulator.",

I don\u2019t think evil is too strong a word for him.\u201d Glover said Field had taken pleasure in tormenting Farquhar and torturing him physically and mentally, adding: \u201cEverything is about Ben Field and Ben Field\u2019s gain.\u201d Field and Smith were accused of murdering Farquhar in the village of Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire, in October 2015 and later targeting Moore-Martin, who died in May 2017 of natural causes. Prosecutors alleged that Field, who had undergone a \u201cbetrothal\u201d ceremony with Farquhar, had a \u201cprofound fascination in controlling and manipulating and humiliating and killing\u201d. They argued Field had come up with an \u201cintricate\u201d plot, including drugging, alcohol poisoning, suffocation, falls, attempts to cause heart failure, car crashes and unwitting overdoses. Field and Smith met Farquhar when they were students at Buckingham University. They struck up a friendship and began lodging with him. Oliver Saxby QC, the lead prosecutor, told the jury that Field saw \u201cPeter was vulnerable. And this was something, from the very outset, he decided to exploit.\u201d Field and Farquhar soon entered into a relationship and had a formal ceremony, which they called a betrothal ceremony. In one diary entry, Farquhar described the event as \u201cone of the happiest moments of my life. Gone are the fears of dying alone.\u201d Moore-Martin lived a few doors away from Farquhar. Like him, she was unmarried and had no children. Saxby told the court she was \u201cfundamentally lonely\u201d. Prosecutors argued that Field and Smith embarked on a campaign of gaslighting to get Moore-Martin to question her sanity. They hid things around her house and encouraged thoughts of suicide, the jury was told. Both defendants also wrote messages on Moore-Martin\u2019s mirrors at home that were \u201cbiblical in nature\u201d, telling her to leave her house to Field. Chris Derrick, the head of the complex casework unit at the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s Thames-Chiltern office, said: \u201cI think torture is a word that can be used to described Benjamin Field\u2019s behaviour. He is clearly a very calculating and ruthless man who spent a great deal of time planning what he was going to do.\u201d Field denied murdering Farquhar, maintaining he could have died from taking his usual dose of flurazepam and drinking whisky. He admitted to defrauding Moore-Martin of \u00a34,000 to buy a car. Smith told the jury he was unaware that Field was in a relationship with Farquhar or that he was gaslighting and defrauding him. He also said he had no idea he was a beneficiary of Farquhar\u2019s will. In a statement released by his solicitor, Smith said: \u201cI am relieved that this ordeal is finally over.\u201d Thanking his legal team, friends and family for their support, he added: \u201cThe lessons I take from this case are first and foremost to always be your own person and secondly to always choose your friends very carefully.\u201d Farquhar\u2019s brother, Ian, said: \u201cListening to the trial and hearing Ben Field give his evidence about what he did to Peter has been extremely difficult. His actions have been unbelievably callous, and he has told lie after lie after lie in order to achieve his goals, deceiving everyone he met.\u201d Moore-Martin\u2019s niece Ann-Marie Blake paid tribute to her aunt in a statement. \u201cAunty Ann was the core of our family. She wasn\u2019t just an aunt but a mum, grandmother and aunt all rolled into one. Our lives have all been changed forever and the world is a much darker place without her.\u201d Field\u2019s brother Tom, 24, was cleared of a single charge of fraud. Tom Field did not give evidence in the trial and his barrister argued the prosecution\u2019s own evidence demonstrated he had no case to answer. Benjamin Field showed no emotion as the jury forewoman returned the verdicts. When his brother, who was on bail, was released from the dock he hugged his parents. Mr Justice Sweeney adjourned sentencing until a pre-sentence psychiatric report had been carried out.",

Nowhere is that more the case than in the car industry, which is contending with a backlash against diesel and weaker demand in China that has coincided with Brexit uncertainty stifling investment.</p> \n<p>The \u201cperfect storm\u201d for carmakers has quickly been passed down the supply chain, according to David Caro, the owner of Qualplast, a Birmingham-based maker of flock coatings for car parts such as glove compartments and coin trays in vehicles made by Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and Bentley. The company, which employs 17 people, has seen a fall in orders from some of its major customers as they adjust to lower sales.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0c200f0d-cdb0-408d-a119-9c973cced423\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>One of the two main definitions of recession in the UK is at least two quarters of negative economic growth. Judged by this&nbsp;yardstick, the UK was last in recession in 2008-09, when there were&nbsp;six consecutive quarters of negative growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Some economists believe this definition of recession is flawed, since an economy would not be in recession if it contracted by 5% in the first quarter, expanded by 0.1% in each of the following two quarters and then contracted again by 5% in the fourth quarter. It would, however, be deemed to be in recession if it grew by 5% in each of the first and fourth quarters but contracted by 0.1% in each of the second and third quarters.</p>\n    <p>An alternative \u2013 and tougher definition \u2013 is a full calendar year of negative output. Given the UK economy has grown on average by 2.5% over many decades, it is rare for gross domestic product (GDP) to fall on an annual basis. There have been only five such years since the end of the second world war: 1974, 1975, 1980, 1981 and 1991.</p>\n    <p>The United States has its own method of assessing recession, with the National Bureau of Economic Research's business cycle-dating committee making a judgment.</p>\n    <p>The NBER defines recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production and wholesale-retail sales\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A no-deal Brexit would be a \u201cmajor disaster for the UK\u201d, but particularly for importers like him, he said.</p> \n<p>Like many in his industry, Caro\u2019s firm is in \u201chunker down position\u201d ahead of the 31 October deadline to leave the EU to which Boris Johnson\u2019s government has stated it is committed.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe industry is holding its breath waiting to see what will happen with Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be surprised if there\u2019s any new substantial investment before they know what\u2019s going to happen with no deal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Qualplast fires fibres into an adhesive to produce a smooth, even finish on its coatings. However, the firm imports all of its materials from mainland Europe.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t buy the stuff we need from the UK,\u201d said Caro, adding that he has been forced to go through a second round of stockpiling for the 31 October date, after building up supplies for the previous no-deal deadline in March. A no-deal exit would lead to higher transport costs because of the need to go through customs checks, while tariffs could also eat into margins, he adds.</p> \n<p>Caro believes one of the totemic manufacturing industries still in the UK finds it hard to look beyond the Halloween deadline.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With British manufacturing contracting sharply in the second quarter, industrial firms large and small are under pressure. Nowhere is that more the case than in the car industry, which is contending with a backlash against diesel and weaker demand in China that has coincided with Brexit uncertainty stifling investment. The \u201cperfect storm\u201d for carmakers has quickly been passed down the supply chain, according to David Caro, the owner of Qualplast, a Birmingham-based maker of flock coatings for car parts such as glove compartments and coin trays in vehicles made by Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and Bentley. The company, which employs 17 people, has seen a fall in orders from some of its major customers as they adjust to lower sales. A no-deal Brexit would be a \u201cmajor disaster for the UK\u201d, but particularly for importers like him, he said. Like many in his industry, Caro\u2019s firm is in \u201chunker down position\u201d ahead of the 31 October deadline to leave the EU to which Boris Johnson\u2019s government has stated it is committed. \u201cThe industry is holding its breath waiting to see what will happen with Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be surprised if there\u2019s any new substantial investment before they know what\u2019s going to happen with no deal.\u201d Qualplast fires fibres into an adhesive to produce a smooth, even finish on its coatings. However, the firm imports all of its materials from mainland Europe. \u201cWe can\u2019t buy the stuff we need from the UK,\u201d said Caro, adding that he has been forced to go through a second round of stockpiling for the 31 October date, after building up supplies for the previous no-deal deadline in March. A no-deal exit would lead to higher transport costs because of the need to go through customs checks, while tariffs could also eat into margins, he adds. Caro believes one of the totemic manufacturing industries still in the UK finds it hard to look beyond the Halloween deadline.",

Their advance in the last two years from Championship drek to a Premier League force has been a thrill ride but the steps that follow from that bring challenges to which they must rise. On Sunday they begin their domestic season by jousting with a reinforced Leicester three days after a 6,000-mile round trip to Armenia for a Europa League tie against Pyunik. There was no such carry-on last season.</p> \n<p>Not that Wolves are whining. The club are proud of a trailblazing tradition dating back to the 1950s, when they were England\u2019s first representatives in a European competition they helped to inspire. The idea of setting off on such adventures again was outlandish just two years ago after the club muddled along to 15th place in the Championship before appointing Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo as their fourth manager in 10 months. Nuno, making the most of investment from the Chinese owners who took over the club in 2016 and the influence of the agent Jorge Mendes, has overseen extraordinary progress. But can he continue to do so?</p> \n<p>After Sunday\u2019s trip to Leicester, Wolves will host the second leg against Pyunik before taking on Manchester United four days later. By then they may have a keener insight into why Burnley did not win a domestic match last season until after their elimination from the Europa League. On the other hand, flip that. Wolves are better than Burnley. And a club that have got most things right in the last couple of years is unlikely to be taken by surprise by the consequences of their success. They are cutting things fine but that is how they like it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/wolves-zip/giv-3902FdTPsjTTGmyo\" data-alt=\"Last five\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/wolves-zip/giv-3902FdTPsjTTGmyo\">Last five</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Wolves made sure not to overwork themselves in pre-season, playing just two warm-up matches before engaging in competitive games (those warm-ups could hardly have gone better, bringing a big win over Newcastle and a victory on penalties over Manchester City). Nor, more intriguingly, did they go wild on the recruitment front. There must have been a temptation to launch into a spending spree in advance of the expanded new campaign but Nuno has always believed in keeping his squad size lean so as to protect morale and give existing players room to improve. He believes in his players and his coaching.</p> \n<p>The biggest deal Wolves made this summer was for a player who was already there, as they forked out \u00a330m to complete the permanent transfer of Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, the striker who excelled while on loan at Molineux last season. They also paid \u00a312m to keep another successful loanee, the midfielder Leander Dendoncker. Beyond that pair there have been only a few additions, each of them promising.</p> \n<p>Patrick Cutrone, a 21-year-old signed from Milan, has not been prolific in his short career but brings qualities \u2013 intelligence, dynamism and power \u2013 that suggest he could fit right in at Wolves, offering an alternative to Jim\u00e9nez or Diogo Jota and meaning Ivan Cavaleiro may not be missed after being sold to Fulham. Jes\u00fas Vallejo, hired on loan from Real Madrid after leading Spain to victory at the Under-21 European Championship, is a centre-back of vast potential. The two new young midfielders, 19-year-old Pedro Neto and 20-year-old Bruno Jord\u00e3o, are also gifted, though neither is expected to make an immediate impact. Meanwhile, two youngsters who broke through last season, Morgan Gibbs-White and R\u00faben Vinagre, are expected to be ripe enough to contribute even more this term.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/wolves-zip/giv-3902iPs3oeum0ZRb\" data-alt=\"WDL\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/wolves-zip/giv-3902iPs3oeum0ZRb\">WDL</a> \n</figure> \n<p>But to a large extent Nuno is counting on the players who did so well last season to do so again. Wolves have kept them all. They know the formula and they apply it well. They are solid and fluent, a serious team. It was, incompetence elsewhere notwithstanding, a heck of an achievement for Wolves to go into the Premier League last season and wind up conceding fewer goals than Manchester United and Arsenal.</p> \n<p>Rui Patrico is fine goalkeeper protected by a trio of centre-backs who form a solid shield: Conor Coady orchestrates them well while Wily Boly and Ryan Bennett were both in the top 10 last season for headers and tackles won by centre-backs (and only one defender in the league \u2013 Cardiff \u2019s Bruno Ecuel\u00e9 Manga \u2013 made more interceptions than Boly).

      "bodyText": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position: 9th (NB: this is not necessarily Paul Doyle\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: seventh Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 200-1 Wolves are on a journey, metaphorically and literally. Their advance in the last two years from Championship drek to a Premier League force has been a thrill ride but the steps that follow from that bring challenges to which they must rise. On Sunday they begin their domestic season by jousting with a reinforced Leicester three days after a 6,000-mile round trip to Armenia for a Europa League tie against Pyunik. There was no such carry-on last season. Not that Wolves are whining. The club are proud of a trailblazing tradition dating back to the 1950s, when they were England\u2019s first representatives in a European competition they helped to inspire. The idea of setting off on such adventures again was outlandish just two years ago after the club muddled along to 15th place in the Championship before appointing Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo as their fourth manager in 10 months. Nuno, making the most of investment from the Chinese owners who took over the club in 2016 and the influence of the agent Jorge Mendes, has overseen extraordinary progress. But can he continue to do so? After Sunday\u2019s trip to Leicester, Wolves will host the second leg against Pyunik before taking on Manchester United four days later. By then they may have a keener insight into why Burnley did not win a domestic match last season until after their elimination from the Europa League. On the other hand, flip that. Wolves are better than Burnley. And a club that have got most things right in the last couple of years is unlikely to be taken by surprise by the consequences of their success. They are cutting things fine but that is how they like it. Wolves made sure not to overwork themselves in pre-season, playing just two warm-up matches before engaging in competitive games (those warm-ups could hardly have gone better, bringing a big win over Newcastle and a victory on penalties over Manchester City). Nor, more intriguingly, did they go wild on the recruitment front. There must have been a temptation to launch into a spending spree in advance of the expanded new campaign but Nuno has always believed in keeping his squad size lean so as to protect morale and give existing players room to improve. He believes in his players and his coaching. The biggest deal Wolves made this summer was for a player who was already there, as they forked out \u00a330m to complete the permanent transfer of Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, the striker who excelled while on loan at Molineux last season. They also paid \u00a312m to keep another successful loanee, the midfielder Leander Dendoncker. Beyond that pair there have been only a few additions, each of them promising. Patrick Cutrone, a 21-year-old signed from Milan, has not been prolific in his short career but brings qualities \u2013 intelligence, dynamism and power \u2013 that suggest he could fit right in at Wolves, offering an alternative to Jim\u00e9nez or Diogo Jota and meaning Ivan Cavaleiro may not be missed after being sold to Fulham. Jes\u00fas Vallejo, hired on loan from Real Madrid after leading Spain to victory at the Under-21 European Championship, is a centre-back of vast potential. The two new young midfielders, 19-year-old Pedro Neto and 20-year-old Bruno Jord\u00e3o, are also gifted, though neither is expected to make an immediate impact. Meanwhile, two youngsters who broke through last season, Morgan Gibbs-White and R\u00faben Vinagre, are expected to be ripe enough to contribute even more this term. But to a large extent Nuno is counting on the players who did so well last season to do so again. Wolves have kept them all. They know the formula and they apply it well. They are solid and fluent, a serious team. It was, incompetence elsewhere notwithstanding, a heck of an achievement for Wolves to go into the Premier League last season and wind up conceding fewer goals than Manchester United and Arsenal. Rui Patrico is fine goalkeeper protected by a trio of centre-backs who form a solid shield: Conor Coady orchestrates them well while Wily Boly and Ryan Bennett were both in the top 10 last season for headers and tackles won by centre-backs (and only one defender in the league \u2013 Cardiff \u2019s Bruno Ecuel\u00e9 Manga \u2013 made more interceptions than Boly). The wing-backs, Matt Doherty and Jonny Castro Otto, defended stoutly and raided forward to swashbuckling effect. The central midfielders, Dendoncker, Ruben Neves and Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, won and used the ball well , ensuring Wolves tended to have plenty of possession. The whole team were in synch, with Jota and Jimenez as involved in the play as much as anyone. Wolves were brilliant at coiling up and then springing forward to cut open opponents. Where they need to get better, though, is in opening up teams who defend en masse. They won more points last season against the top six than the bottom six. Teams who set out solely to frustrate them often succeeded: in two games against Brighton Wolves had 47 shots without scoring. They ended the season having struck fewer goals than Bournemouth or Crystal Palace.

If they work that out, if the handful of recruits raise the calibre of the squad and if, like last season, they are spared injuries to key players despite the strain of European competition, then Wolves\u2019 are likely to continue moving in the right direction. If not they will stall but they are too good to fall.",

      "bodyText": "The yellow cranes were nicknamed Samson and Goliath, soaring steel giants that defined Belfast\u2019s skyline and symbolised Northern Ireland\u2019s industrial might. Hulking over the Harland and Wolff shipyard, each could lift loads weighing hundreds of tonnes, dangling them like playthings over thousands of workers below who hammered and clanged and welded \u2013 a thunderous, daily cacophony. It was a moment of immense pride every time an ocean liner, tanker, ferry or navy vessel slid down the ramp into the waters of the River Lagan. A 1986 company history book was titled Shipbuilders to the World. Few seemed to notice or care that in the Old Testament Samson and Goliath came to bad ends: one betrayed, the other slain. Their Belfast counterparts this week experienced their own twist of fortune. Harland and Wolff Heavy Industries, since 1861 the maker of some of the world\u2019s most famous ships, including the Titanic, collapsed into administration. The two great cranes are now motionless; their fate, like that of the stricken company\u2019s employees, uncertain. \u201cForty-three years I worked here, now on to the scrap heap,\u201d said Gary Fleming, 59, a fitter, as he wandered through a deserted shipyard.

      "body": "<p>A notification from the astrology app Co-Star recently told 27-year-old Bridget: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to catch feelings.\u201d Bridget knows how ridiculous that sounds, she says, and how baffled older people might be by the enthusiasm with which she follows its advice. But she believes the app\u2019s tongue-in-cheek nature is tapping into something more profound: young people\u2019s growing disillusionment with religious and political structures.</p> <p>Bridget is not alone. Astrology is without doubt having a cultural moment. As well as the rapid proliferation of apps such as Co-Star, which has been downloaded more than 3m times since 2017, astrology memes are a staple on Instagram and Twitter, and have sparked a huge boost in traffic to women\u2019s news sites; a typical horoscope post on the Cut got 150% more hits in 2017 than in 2016, while gal-dem, which introduced a horoscope column in March, said posts performed consistently well.</p> <p>Marissa Malik, an astrologist and horoscope writer for gal-dem, puts the resurgent interest in astrology down to widespread anger and frustration with job insecurity, the housing crisis and an ecological system on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>\u201cPeople feel there\u2019s so little we can do in terms of changing politics in a way that benefits marginalised people,\u201d she said. \u201cAstrology reminds us that there\u2019s something bigger than humans on Earth influencing us. Thinking of the world as just being governed by the criminals it is now is pretty grim.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebfd985db89c87fefcd7fa1df87a1dc9fb24be8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebfd985db89c87fefcd7fa1df87a1dc9fb24be8d/0_330_6845_4107/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa Malik.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marissa Malik.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While people still turn to professional astrologers to ask what Wade Caves, a tutor at the School of Traditional Astrology based in the UK, describes as \u201cbread and butter\u201d questions \u2013 \u201cWhen will I get married?\u201d or \u201cWill I get that job promotion?\u201d \u2013 the recent boom in astrology is also concerned with social change. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of folks who are looking at astrology to understand what is called \u2018late-stage capitalism\u2019, and some of it is tied with feminism and the queer movement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Co-Star and other iterations such as TimePassages, The Pattern, and Sanctuary require users to submit their date of birth, including the exact time they were born and the location, to provide instantaneous \u201cbirth charts\u201d and access information on planetary movements to give personalised readings.

      "bodyText": "A notification from the astrology app Co-Star recently told 27-year-old Bridget: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to catch feelings.\u201d Bridget knows how ridiculous that sounds, she says, and how baffled older people might be by the enthusiasm with which she follows its advice. But she believes the app\u2019s tongue-in-cheek nature is tapping into something more profound: young people\u2019s growing disillusionment with religious and political structures. Bridget is not alone. Astrology is without doubt having a cultural moment. As well as the rapid proliferation of apps such as Co-Star, which has been downloaded more than 3m times since 2017, astrology memes are a staple on Instagram and Twitter, and have sparked a huge boost in traffic to women\u2019s news sites; a typical horoscope post on the Cut got 150% more hits in 2017 than in 2016, while gal-dem, which introduced a horoscope column in March, said posts performed consistently well. Marissa Malik, an astrologist and horoscope writer for gal-dem, puts the resurgent interest in astrology down to widespread anger and frustration with job insecurity, the housing crisis and an ecological system on the brink of collapse. \u201cPeople feel there\u2019s so little we can do in terms of changing politics in a way that benefits marginalised people,\u201d she said. \u201cAstrology reminds us that there\u2019s something bigger than humans on Earth influencing us. Thinking of the world as just being governed by the criminals it is now is pretty grim.\u201d While people still turn to professional astrologers to ask what Wade Caves, a tutor at the School of Traditional Astrology based in the UK, describes as \u201cbread and butter\u201d questions \u2013 \u201cWhen will I get married?\u201d or \u201cWill I get that job promotion?\u201d \u2013 the recent boom in astrology is also concerned with social change. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of folks who are looking at astrology to understand what is called \u2018late-stage capitalism\u2019, and some of it is tied with feminism and the queer movement,\u201d he said. Co-Star and other iterations such as TimePassages, The Pattern, and Sanctuary require users to submit their date of birth, including the exact time they were born and the location, to provide instantaneous \u201cbirth charts\u201d and access information on planetary movements to give personalised readings. Users can share each other\u2019s personalised charts to see how compatible they are with friends and romantic interests.

      "bodyText": "Two people are facing prison sentences after they admitted accessing footage of the footballer Emiliano Sala\u2019s postmortem examination. The Argentinian\u2019s body was recovered from a plane wreck on 6 February, two weeks after it crashed into the Channel. Sala, 28, who had just signed a \u00a315m contract for Cardiff City, had been flying from Nantes in France to the Welsh capital on 21 January. An autopsy took place at Bournemouth mortuary the day after specialist contractors removed his body from the Piper Malibu light aircraft. The body of the pilot, David Ibbotson, has never been found. During an appearance at Swindon crown court on Friday, Sherry Bray, 49, and Christopher Ashford, 62, both from Wiltshire, admitted accessing CCTV footage of the examination. Ashford and Bray, from Calne and Corsham respectively, admitted to three counts of securing unauthorised access to computer material between 9 and 11 February this year. Bray also admitted perverting the course of public justice after instructing Ashford on 12 February to \u201cdelete your pics\u201d, and the next day deleting the postmortem cameras from the live feed camera facility and deleting a postmortem image of Sala from her mobile phone. Two of the charges against Bray of securing unauthorised access to computer material relate to her operating CCTV equipment at the mortuary to access the examination of Sala. The third charge relates to her using the equipment on 24 April last year to view the postmortem of another man, Andrew Victor Latcham. The pair were told by the judge, Peter Crabtree, that the starting point for sentencing for such offences was custody. He said the case was \u201cextremely serious\u201d. Wiltshire police said Bray was the director of a CCTV company in Chippenham which held the out-of-hours contract to monitor the cameras at the mortuary in Bournemouth and that Ashford was an employee. It said an investigation was launched after a graphic image of Sala\u2019s post-mortem examination was spotted circulating on social media, and this led to the CCTV company\u2019s offices being searched. The inquiry found Bray had taken photographs of the footage on her phone and sent a picture to another person using Facebook Messenger. The pair were released on bail and will reappear at the court on 20 September.",

      "bodyText": "Who would imagine that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recommendation for a book to take on holiday might plunge the reader into a world of cut-throat technological competition and the pursuit of monopoly? Apparently not those who have seized on the Facebook co-founder\u2019s choice of The Last Days of Night by Graham Moore, which describes the race to bring electricity to the US and the consequent riches up for grabs. Indeed, it has been taken as a manifestation of Zuckerberg\u2019s inability to conceal his true drive to world domination, an inadvertent drop of the mask. To which one might reply: did you think he was sitting on his sunlounger reading through the works of Barbara Pym? Zuckerberg, after all, is the man who last year came up with 23 titles for a Facebook-centred book club, among which were Matt Ridley\u2019s The Rational Optimist, which isolates the tendency to trade in markets as a key human trait, Henry Kissinger\u2019s World Order and, a little surprisingly, William James\u2019s The Varieties of Religious Experience. Mr Light Read he ain\u2019t. Nor, in fairness, is Angela Merkel, whose choice of Tyrant, an analysis of Shakespeare\u2019s exploration of power and totalitarianism by the scholar Stephen Greenblatt, has also come to light as she takes a holiday in the Italian Alps. What might possibly have led her to this fascinating choice? Merkel was actually engaged in a private act of reading, not sharing her choices with the world, unlike the Silicon Valley head honchos who joined Zuckerberg: the Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, for example, who is reading a memoir by the founder of Nike, or Sheryl Sandberg, deep into Melinda Gates\u2019s The Moment of Lift. (Side question: is it an article of faith that all these guys have to read each others\u2019 books? Do you get drummed out of the gazillionaires\u2019 philanthropy clubhouse if you don\u2019t?) This all seems a long way from the more genteel business of writers taking to the pages of weekend newspapers in order to suggest toothsome thrillers and haunting memoirs to fill the (often mythical) hours of peace and contemplation that summer promises. Certainly, it doesn\u2019t recall Barack Obama\u2019s championing of the novelist Marilynne Robinson, or his description of rereading VS Naipaul\u2019s A House for Mr Biswas following the author\u2019s death, or his raving about Tara Westover\u2019s Educated. But there is a difference between the way in which those recommendations are received, and what we like to read in to the bookish lives of those we see as wielding immense \u2013 and often covert \u2013 power over us. Obama\u2019s talent was to come across as a genuine reader who happened to be president; whereas we see in the choices of the Silicon Valley supremos something more subtly sinister and manifesto-like, keener to shape our tastes and attitudes.

They had 15 minutes to find a new kit but did not make the deadline so Colombia were awarded a 20-0 victory, meaning Argentina are out of the competition., 2:B - Wimbledon wore plain strips in the first season of the Premier League but they soon caught on, bringing LBC radio station onboard as their shirt sponsor the following campaign. Their near neighbours, QPR, were also sponsored by a radio station in the early 1990s. They had the Classic FM logo on their shirts; a classy touch for a classy team., 3:C - Here's the story in Forl\u00e1n's own words: \"Ferguson wanted me to play with long studs, the interchangeable ones that suit wet pitches, but I feel more comfortable in short ones. I agreed to change but I didn't and, against Chelsea, I slipped in front of goal and wasted a chance. Afterwards, I rushed to the dressing room to change boots but Ferguson caught me. He grabbed the boots and threw them. That was my last game for United.\", 4:B - Gal\u00e1cticos recognise gal\u00e1cticos., 5:C - Emmanuel Petit did the same in 1998 (for France in the World Cup final against Brazil and then for Arsenal in the league against Nottingham Forest)., 6:A - Micky Quinn in 1993 and Dion Dublin in 1997., 7:D - United lost their first two games (and drew their third) in the first season of the Premier League. The start of the season can be overrated. In the 2010-11 season, Chelsea won their first two games 6-0 but didn\u2019t finish as champions., 8:B - Kyrgios threw his towel at the umpire. Inevitably, he missed., 9:B - Brown went into a cryotherapy machine without the proper footwear. We've all been there., 10:B - Frampton was due to fight Emmanuel Dominguez in Philadelphia on Saturday night but has pulled out. \"I\u2019m absolutely devastated,\" he said. \"It should be nailed to the floor and it isn't. You couldn't make it up.\" , 11:C - \u201cWe sent an email out to the clubs because this happens often,\u201d said Bristol City manager Lee Johnston. \u201cSomebody goes down and sometimes it\u2019s tactical, because people try and gain an advantage and sometimes it\u2019s genuine. So we just decided as a club that we\u2019re going to make a rule that we\u2019re going to let the referee manage the game.\u201d</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"12\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Oh dear\" data-share=\"I scored 2/11 in the Guardian's sports quiz of the week\" data-min-score=\"2\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">2 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Oh dear</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Oh well, have a great weekend\" data-share=\"I scored 3/11 in the Guardian's sports quiz of the week\" data-min-score=\"3\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">3 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Oh well, have a great weekend</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Oh well, have a great weekend\" data-share=\"I scored 4/11 in the Guardian's sports quiz of the week\" data-min-score=\"4\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">4 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Oh well, have a great weekend</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"A fine effort.

      "body": "<p>They were there for him. J\u00fcrgen Klopp, the manager of Liverpool, has credited Ross, Rachel, Phoebe, Monica, Joey and Chandler with teaching him English. Watching the long-running sitcom Friends helped him bridge the gaps in his language comprehension, he told <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/49264085\">BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Football Daily podcast</a> on Wednesday. \u201cThe easiest to follow for Germans in English is Friends. It\u2019s easy conversation. You can understand pretty much each word, pretty early,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Friends is, in fact, a time-honoured English teacher. <a href=\"https://www.sny.tv/yankees/news/yankees-severino-used-friends-to-help-learn-english-i-love-watching-friends/286269016\">Both Luis Severino</a> of the New York Yankees baseball team, who is from the Dominican Republic, and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/sports/baseball/friends-tv-show-baseball-spanish.html\">Venezuelan Wilmer Flores</a>, formerly of the rival Mets, have spoken about learning colloquial language from the show. (Flores, who has said he watches Friends almost daily, even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KennyDucey/status/772616438683238400\">changed his walk-up music</a> to the theme tune by the Rembrandts.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"44a3a9668a17c5f8364f8b651834d65510668a6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44a3a9668a17c5f8364f8b651834d65510668a6a/706_145_1336_1655/807.jpg\" alt=\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp\" width=\"807\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp: speaking English like a native (of New York)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malcolm Mackenzie/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rap Monster, AKA RM, a member of the Korean boyband BTS, <a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2017/03/30/hit-korean-boy-band-bts-is-ready-to-take-over-anaheim/\">has said Friends</a> is widely used by mothers in South Korea to encourage their children\u2019s interest in English, \u201ceven when they were eating food or playing\u201d. He estimates that he had watched all 10 seasons at least five times, studying not only the cast\u2019s language, but also their gestures and expressions, so as to know how to communicate American emotion. He concluded: \u201cGod bless Friends!\u201d</p> <p>Any language teacher will tell you that exposure in as many forms as possible is the key to fluency; Klopp says he supplemented his time at Central Perk with English-language radio and films. A <a href=\"https://www.english.com/blog/learning-english-tv-films/\">2015 survey by the education publisher Pearson English</a> found that, of the English learners surveyed, almost 60% used movies and TV shows to improve their skills, with 24% citing the Netflix political drama House of Cards as the series that helped them most. Next came Breaking Bad (24%) and Downton Abbey (19%). Arsenal\u2019s Basque coach Unai Emery <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/uk/latest-news/a25421312/arsenal-manager-unai-emery-is-learning-english-by-watching-peaky-blinders/\">opts for Peaky Blinders</a>: \u201cIt is good, but it is difficult [to understand people] from Birmingham. And it\u2019s aggressive.

      "bodyText": "They were there for him. J\u00fcrgen Klopp, the manager of Liverpool, has credited Ross, Rachel, Phoebe, Monica, Joey and Chandler with teaching him English. Watching the long-running sitcom Friends helped him bridge the gaps in his language comprehension, he told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Football Daily podcast on Wednesday. \u201cThe easiest to follow for Germans in English is Friends. It\u2019s easy conversation. You can understand pretty much each word, pretty early,\u201d he said. Friends is, in fact, a time-honoured English teacher. Both Luis Severino of the New York Yankees baseball team, who is from the Dominican Republic, and the Venezuelan Wilmer Flores, formerly of the rival Mets, have spoken about learning colloquial language from the show. (Flores, who has said he watches Friends almost daily, even changed his walk-up music to the theme tune by the Rembrandts.) Rap Monster, AKA RM, a member of the Korean boyband BTS, has said Friends is widely used by mothers in South Korea to encourage their children\u2019s interest in English, \u201ceven when they were eating food or playing\u201d. He estimates that he had watched all 10 seasons at least five times, studying not only the cast\u2019s language, but also their gestures and expressions, so as to know how to communicate American emotion. He concluded: \u201cGod bless Friends!\u201d Any language teacher will tell you that exposure in as many forms as possible is the key to fluency; Klopp says he supplemented his time at Central Perk with English-language radio and films. A 2015 survey by the education publisher Pearson English found that, of the English learners surveyed, almost 60% used movies and TV shows to improve their skills, with 24% citing the Netflix political drama House of Cards as the series that helped them most. Next came Breaking Bad (24%) and Downton Abbey (19%). Arsenal\u2019s Basque coach Unai Emery opts for Peaky Blinders: \u201cIt is good, but it is difficult [to understand people] from Birmingham. And it\u2019s aggressive. But it\u2019s good,\u201d he says. But polling undertaken in 2012 by a leading English school, Kaplan International English, revealed Friends to be by far the most popular show with its English learners, pointing to its international syndication, catchphrases and \u201ccomedy exploits\u201d. Jeff Astrof, an executive story editor of Friends who also wrote for several episodes, has said he was not surprised by the finding: \u201cIn New York, I had a cab driver of Middle Eastern descent say: \u2018Could there be any more traffic?\u2019 in his best Chandler dialect.\u201d The research also found that people who said Friends helped them learn English were more likely to want to travel to the US to study the language. YouTube is replete with educational videos such as \u201cLearn English with Friends\u201d. The Vietnamese English learning platform eJOY praises the show\u2019s \u201cmany scenes of daily life\u201d and its relatable characters: Rachel, \u201cthe daughter of a businessman\u201d; Joey, \u201cthe actor with an attractive voice\u201d; \u201c9-to-5 guy\u201d Chandler; Monica, the \u201ccharismatic chef\u201d; \u201cmystery singer\u201d Phoebe; and Ross. The company suggests that learners \u201cpractise speaking like your favourite character\u201d, and cites specific episodes from which to learn how to use \u201cnice to meet you\u201d (The One With Chandler\u2019s Work Laugh); \u201chave second thoughts\u201d (The One Where Ross and Rachel Take A Break), and \u201cgo out\u201d (The One With Rachel\u2019s Inadvertent Kiss). English learner platforms seem to largely sit out the contemporary debate over whether the sitcom is sexist, homophobic or otherwise problematic \u2013 but at least Klopp seems conscious of the characters\u2019 shortcomings. Asked by the BBC which of the three male leads of Friends he most identified with, Klopp said: \u201cNo. No. No, no, no. No no no.\u201d After a long pause, he said: \u201cI liked the girls more than the boys,\u201d and laughed heartily.

Amazon writ large, The Cloud is the invention of billionaire Gibson Wells, who oversees a city-state environment called MotherCloud, where every aspect of workers\u2019 lives is rigorously monitored and controlled.

Eighteen-year-old Casiopea Tun lives in a dead-end southern Mexican town, works as a servant for her rich grandfather, and dreams of escape. When she opens a chest in his bedroom, she discovers not the riches she had hoped to find, but the bones of the Mayan god of death, Hun-Kam\u00e9. A shard of bone embeds itself in her thumb, thus bringing Hun-Kam\u00e9 to a semblance of life. In the finest fairytale tradition, the god promises to fulfil Casiopea\u2019s dreams if she will help him regain his missing body parts and resume his rightful place on the throne of Xibalba, the Mayan underworld. There follows a richly picaresque adventure as Casiopea and Hun-Kam\u00e9 travel around Mexico on the god\u2019s quest.

      "body": "<p>Last year, I was having coffee with a curator, a person from whom I hoped to extract paid work at some point. It was one of those inconvenient midweek interludes most people who work in the arts must endure, a vague invitation extended by someone with money and opportunities. There is rarely a particular reason specified for meetings of this kind, no promise of material reward, yet you nevertheless trek into central London, spend three hours and \u00a37 you can\u2019t afford, and try to be your best, most charming self. You work a career-highlights reel into supposedly casual conversation, aiming to appear thrilling, and charismatic, and sexy enough that the curator, or commissioner, or editor might wish to purchase some of your cultural capital.</p> <p>This particular meeting was not going well. The curator looked at her phone more than she looked at me, making me increasingly anxious about my lack of engaging wit, so that eventually I was mugging and pantomiming like a tragic clown to an unresponsive audience. Then, while she was re-checking her email, she muttered something about having to attend her reunion at Cambridge.</p> <p>\u201cAsk me, ask me, ask me,\u201d I begged her inside my head, and then she did.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you go to uni?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t,\u201d I replied breezily, \u201cI dropped out.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, I had caught her interest. \u201cNow that \u2013 <em>that</em> \u2013 is interesting,\u201d she said, jabbing her finger across the table.</p> <p>It\u2019s 10 years since I dropped out of university. In that decade, I\u2019ve felt vicious hatred toward academia and pre-emptive disdain for all the snobs I imagine to be hiding inside it. I\u2019ve felt, too, a terrible and consuming grief for what might have been, had I not been too stupid. And I\u2019ve gladly indulged the idiot savant fantasies of over-educated, upper-class arts professionals who find my educational vacuum (relatively unusual for an arts writer) to be refreshing and winningly salt-of-the-earth.</p> <p>When I was a little girl in Waterford, I was clever. I wasn\u2019t a swot exactly, but I loved to learn and was never without a book. I remember finishing novels while still sitting in the bookshop, as my father nattered to some friend he had bumped into, speeding to the end so he could buy me a different one to take home. There is a cutesy bit of family lore which says that when I was four, my grandmother had me on her lap and asked what I wanted Santa to bring me for Christmas, and I replied, pious as anything, \u201cTwo little books.\u201d</p> <p>Adults praised me for this behaviour, so I learned quickly that I was clever, and that being clever was a thing that made other people admire me. I wasn\u2019t a particularly attractive child \u2013 stubbornly unathletic, doughy, legendarily the only child in a summer camp gymnastics class who failed to execute a tumble \u2013 but I didn\u2019t mind that, not yet. I was clever, instead. On a trip to the Irish capital with my father, when I was still quite small, we walked through the campus of Trinity College Dublin and I was mesmerised by its orderliness, buildings that looked like illustrations, the laughing young adults running about in strange, antiquated garb. \u201cI\u2019m going to go here,\u201d I said to my dad, which became true. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to sit under that tree doing my homework,\u201d which did not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The shame of my failure, which I can still feel plaguing my stomach to this day, was much more acute back then</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are many reasons I dropped out of university, which I did, in fact, not once but twice. The first time was a few months into Film Studies and French at Trinity, subjects chosen because I didn\u2019t have the marks to study English, as I had wanted to, but couldn\u2019t abandon my childhood fantasies of those grand courtyards and exotically Protestant spires. The second was from an English and Cultural Studies course at a smaller college \u2013 perhaps things would have been different if I had gone there first time round, but by the time I did arrive I was already too far gone to function.</p> <p>That I did so twice is a detail I smooth over in glib retellings of my past \u2013 complicating, as it does, the impression I want to give of a worldly young intellectual who glanced at the bourgeois trappings of academia and quickly rejected them. The reasons are compelling enough: there was mental illness, there was drinking and there was pregnancy, in a time before abortion was legal in Ireland. I\u2019m convinced that having to be pregnant when you don\u2019t want to be, can\u2019t physically bear to be, is enough to drive a person mad.</p> <p>It could be as easy as that: I could say, truthfully, I had a run of bad luck. I suspect, though, that I would have dropped out anyway, even without the legitimate traumas I can wheel out to explain myself to others. When I arrived at Trinity, for all my problems, I still believed myself to be essentially clever and interesting, and within four weeks, that idea of myself, which had kept me safe, had been shattered. It wasn\u2019t as though I had always achieved the best grades, but I had prided myself on an insightful approach to things, an original way of thinking \u2013 a delusion which was quickly cleared up for me by my film studies tutor.

For a while, I was busy forgetting and making ends meet. Everyone I knew who was still at college partied as much as I did and seemed barely to attend lectures.

One day, near the end of her degree, my friend Fiona had me read an essay she had written about Pet Sematary by Stephen King, which was one of my favourite books.

I could tell that the essay was very good because it was well written and structured (she got a first, if I recall), but I had no idea what it meant or why someone would write it.

What had the phallus to do with Pet Sematary? To me the book was worth something because it made me cry and feel afraid. It dawned on me then that all I knew how to do was feel, not how to think, and maybe now I would never learn. This is what it has come down to again and again: that I am all raw nerves, no finesse.

      "bodyText": "Last year, I was having coffee with a curator, a person from whom I hoped to extract paid work at some point. It was one of those inconvenient midweek interludes most people who work in the arts must endure, a vague invitation extended by someone with money and opportunities. There is rarely a particular reason specified for meetings of this kind, no promise of material reward, yet you nevertheless trek into central London, spend three hours and \u00a37 you can\u2019t afford, and try to be your best, most charming self. You work a career-highlights reel into supposedly casual conversation, aiming to appear thrilling, and charismatic, and sexy enough that the curator, or commissioner, or editor might wish to purchase some of your cultural capital. This particular meeting was not going well. The curator looked at her phone more than she looked at me, making me increasingly anxious about my lack of engaging wit, so that eventually I was mugging and pantomiming like a tragic clown to an unresponsive audience. Then, while she was re-checking her email, she muttered something about having to attend her reunion at Cambridge. \u201cAsk me, ask me, ask me,\u201d I begged her inside my head, and then she did. \u201cWhere did you go to uni?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t,\u201d I replied breezily, \u201cI dropped out.\u201d Finally, I had caught her interest. \u201cNow that \u2013 that \u2013 is interesting,\u201d she said, jabbing her finger across the table. It\u2019s 10 years since I dropped out of university. In that decade, I\u2019ve felt vicious hatred toward academia and pre-emptive disdain for all the snobs I imagine to be hiding inside it. I\u2019ve felt, too, a terrible and consuming grief for what might have been, had I not been too stupid. And I\u2019ve gladly indulged the idiot savant fantasies of over-educated, upper-class arts professionals who find my educational vacuum (relatively unusual for an arts writer) to be refreshing and winningly salt-of-the-earth. When I was a little girl in Waterford, I was clever. I wasn\u2019t a swot exactly, but I loved to learn and was never without a book. I remember finishing novels while still sitting in the bookshop, as my father nattered to some friend he had bumped into, speeding to the end so he could buy me a different one to take home. There is a cutesy bit of family lore which says that when I was four, my grandmother had me on her lap and asked what I wanted Santa to bring me for Christmas, and I replied, pious as anything, \u201cTwo little books.\u201d Adults praised me for this behaviour, so I learned quickly that I was clever, and that being clever was a thing that made other people admire me. I wasn\u2019t a particularly attractive child \u2013 stubbornly unathletic, doughy, legendarily the only child in a summer camp gymnastics class who failed to execute a tumble \u2013 but I didn\u2019t mind that, not yet. I was clever, instead. On a trip to the Irish capital with my father, when I was still quite small, we walked through the campus of Trinity College Dublin and I was mesmerised by its orderliness, buildings that looked like illustrations, the laughing young adults running about in strange, antiquated garb. \u201cI\u2019m going to go here,\u201d I said to my dad, which became true. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to sit under that tree doing my homework,\u201d which did not. There are many reasons I dropped out of university, which I did, in fact, not once but twice. The first time was a few months into Film Studies and French at Trinity, subjects chosen because I didn\u2019t have the marks to study English, as I had wanted to, but couldn\u2019t abandon my childhood fantasies of those grand courtyards and exotically Protestant spires. The second was from an English and Cultural Studies course at a smaller college \u2013 perhaps things would have been different if I had gone there first time round, but by the time I did arrive I was already too far gone to function. That I did so twice is a detail I smooth over in glib retellings of my past \u2013 complicating, as it does, the impression I want to give of a worldly young intellectual who glanced at the bourgeois trappings of academia and quickly rejected them. The reasons are compelling enough: there was mental illness, there was drinking and there was pregnancy, in a time before abortion was legal in Ireland. I\u2019m convinced that having to be pregnant when you don\u2019t want to be, can\u2019t physically bear to be, is enough to drive a person mad. It could be as easy as that: I could say, truthfully, I had a run of bad luck. I suspect, though, that I would have dropped out anyway, even without the legitimate traumas I can wheel out to explain myself to others. When I arrived at Trinity, for all my problems, I still believed myself to be essentially clever and interesting, and within four weeks, that idea of myself, which had kept me safe, had been shattered. It wasn\u2019t as though I had always achieved the best grades, but I had prided myself on an insightful approach to things, an original way of thinking \u2013 a delusion which was quickly cleared up for me by my film studies tutor. In one of the first, and only, essays I would ever submit to her, she wrote that my analysis of a marriage in an Israeli film about forbidden love \u201csounds like it comes from a women\u2019s magazine\u201d, a blow so cutting I can still see it flashing before my eyes in her monstrous green ink. Almost as soon as I began, I was lost. The idea of getting up each day and going to class, of learning over and over again that I was stupid, and crass, and incompetent, did not seem doable. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that I was there to learn, to become less stupid. I felt I had failed already, fumbled the opening pass. I had arrived to university quite mad already and quickly became exuberantly so, drinking litres of gin by night and lying in bed, shaking with fear, all day long. It wasn\u2019t laziness, exactly, that stopped me trying to work, but that fear. It lay immobile on my chest. All of Dublin, but especially Trinity, felt corrupted by some malign force that I couldn\u2019t break through. Each morning I would wake up in tears and bargain with myself: I could stay in bed and hide again today, as long as I absolutely did something about it tomorrow. I could see a counsellor, call my tutor, get the train home and tell my dad everything. I would do something that would compel movement out of the static in which I was prone. But, as is the way with days, they became weeks, months, and finally years, and the bargain was never squared, so that what I had feared became true and I really did fail. Though there is more I could say on this \u2013 details that would both elicit sympathy and make me look like a spoiled little shit \u2013 that was all there really was to it. The slow, boring poison of drink and secret-keeping, spread out into every part of my life, so that nothing was safe or good any more.

Last week\u2019s victory was at Torquay and the Cornishman always plays well in his native West Country. Adams did have favourable pairings in the final two rounds when the colour allocation gave him White in both, allowing him to display his impressive skills with his invariable 1 e4 against <a href=\"https://www.chessbomb.com/arena/2019-british-chess-championships/08-Adams_Michael-Pert_Richard_G\" title=\"\">the 1\u2026c6 Caro-Kann of Richard Pert</a> and the 1\u2026c5 Sicilian of Stephen Gordon.</p> <p>These seven championships have put Adams within striking distance of the records of Jonathan Penrose, who won 10 between 1958 and 1969, and Henry Atkins, who won nine between 1905 and 1925. Penrose was a college lecturer and Atkins a school headmaster, both with limited time for tournaments, while Adams was ranked world No 4 at his peak and reached a global final in 2004.</p> <p>Even at 47, Adams could still hope to win another four titles but that is unlikely to be his priority and, as for the record gap between first and last championships, he will not even think about it.

      "bodyText": "Michael Adams edged out David Howell for the British championship last weekend as the pair, who are separated by a whisker in the global live ratings, both finished unbeaten with 7.5/9 and 7/9. The rising North London talent Ravi Haria, 20, drew with both of them and shared third with Richard Palliser on 6.5/9. Jovanka Houska, the England No 1, retained the women\u2019s title, incorporated within the main event, with an excellent 6/9. Adams\u2019s seventh championship came 30 years after his first, at 17 and still the record youngest, at Plymouth 1989. Last week\u2019s victory was at Torquay and the Cornishman always plays well in his native West Country. Adams did have favourable pairings in the final two rounds when the colour allocation gave him White in both, allowing him to display his impressive skills with his invariable 1 e4 against the 1\u2026c6 Caro-Kann of Richard Pert and the 1\u2026c5 Sicilian of Stephen Gordon. These seven championships have put Adams within striking distance of the records of Jonathan Penrose, who won 10 between 1958 and 1969, and Henry Atkins, who won nine between 1905 and 1925. Penrose was a college lecturer and Atkins a school headmaster, both with limited time for tournaments, while Adams was ranked world No 4 at his peak and reached a global final in 2004. Even at 47, Adams could still hope to win another four titles but that is unlikely to be his priority and, as for the record gap between first and last championships, he will not even think about it. Sammy Reshevsky had 33 years between his first and last US titles, Roddy McKay 42 years between his first and last Scottish titles and Howard Williams 43 years between his first and last victories in Wales. Perhaps the most significant results at Torquay were achieved by a quartet of players aged between 17 and 20 who made their best showings yet in the championship. Ravi Haria already has one GM norm and missed a second by just half a point after escaping in the final round when GM John Emms, in a winning position, blundered at move 29. Among those tied for eighth place with 5.5/9 in the field of 54 were Matthew Wadsworth,19, and Jonah Willow and Borna Derakhshani, both 17. Wadsworth, like Haria, already has his first GM norm and impressed when he drew with the world No 1 woman, Hou Yifan, in the Oxford v Cambridge match earlier this year. Willow, from Nottingham, is an ambitious talent who plays in many tournaments and also hones his skills online. Derakhshani, who won in attacking style against GM Chris Ward, was an Iranian until he was banned for playing an Israeli in the Gibraltar Open, while his sister Dorsa, who now lives in the US, was banned for not wearing a hijab.

Within this there has been a surge in the number of matches where possession becomes tediously skewed, where to escape with a respectable defeat is a desirable outcome.</p> \n<p>There were notable exceptions last year: Crystal Palace\u2019s willingness to press Manchester City home and away, for example. But the fact these were notable tells its own story. It is a process that will only grow more pronounced with the increased slice of overseas TV rights money for the bigger clubs and moves among club owners to dilute the equal-share principle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"68bc874c-c080-4efb-98c1-cd42665645cc\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>No 1:</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-2019-20-preview-arsenal-unai-emery-champions-league-pepe\">Arsenal</a><br><b>No 2:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-201920-preview-no-2-aston-villa\">Aston Villa</a><br><b>No 3:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-2019-20-preview-bournemouth-eddie-howe\">Bournemouth</a><br><b>No 4:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-201920-preview-no-4-brighton\">Brighton</a><br><b>No 5:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-5-burnley\">Burnley</a><br><b>No 6:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-6-chelsea\">Chelsea</a><br><b>No 7:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-2019-20-preview-crystal-palace-hodgson-zaha\">Crystal Palace</a><br><b>No 8:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-201920-preview-no-8-everton\">Everton</a><br><b>No 9:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-2019-20-preview-leicester-brendan-rodgers-perez-tielemans\">Leicester City</a><br><b>No 10:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-201920-preview-no-10-liverpool\">Liverpool</a><br><b>No 11:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-11-manchester-city\">Manchester City</a><br><b>No 12:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-12-manchester-united\">Manchester United</a><br><b>No 13:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-13-newcastle-united\">Newcastle United</a><br><b>No 14:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-14-norwich-city\">Norwich City</a><br><b>No 15:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-15-sheffield-united\">Sheffield United</a><br><b>No 16:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-16-southampton\">Southampton</a><br><b>No 17:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-17-tottenham\">Tottenham Hotspur</a><br><b>No 18:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-18-watford\">Watford</a><br><b>No 19:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-19-west-ham\">West Ham</a><br><b>No 20:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-20-wolves\">Wolves</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Can anyone close the gap on the top two? Manchester United\u2019s ghost ship of a squad continues to list, unable either to shed its skeleton crew or add sufficient new life. Chelsea have entered a fascinating kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/ross-barkley-eden-hazard-chelsea-fill-void-frank-lampard\" title=\"\">standby mode</a>, one that might ultimately prove beneficial. Tottenham are probably best placed. Harry Kane is in one of his fit periods in between the injured periods. Tanguy Ndombele may take time to settle but he already looks a fine addition.</p> \n<p>Similarly Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 is an ambitious signing for Arsenal, and another indication of the vogue for well-judged moderate-to-big-money buys that has been a feature of City\u2019s own planning over the last few years.</p> \n<p>Still, challenging the top two looks a vertiginous task. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/manchester-city-pay-rodri-release-clause-atletico-madrid-transfer-window-football\" title=\"\">Rodri will</a> strengthen the seams of that wonderful City midfield. And both the champions and Liverpool will improve just by dint of another summer in the hands of Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp.</p> \n<p>Best of all would be another break-out team. Currently Leicester and Wolves look the best placed to press the teams who finished above them last season. Below will be the usual pack of middleweights roped together like survivors on the raft of the Medusa, concerned with little more than staying afloat, continuing to benefit from the extraordinary rewards of Premier League stasis.</p> \n<p>It is a concentration of wealth that affects everything else around it, from devalued domestic cups, to the basic good health of the ever-narrowing pyramid below. On the up-side there will once again be plenty of fine entertaining football played in that middling pack. It is a sign of the Premier League\u2019s riches that there can be a fear of stagnation even while teams like Bournemouth and Watford have such fine attacking talent in their ranks and a club with Burnley\u2019s managerial expertise continues to perform to such a high level.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ae71d4a23607c3e2baf475face902e8c61e74a7d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae71d4a23607c3e2baf475face902e8c61e74a7d/0_99_4379_2627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool and J\u00fcrgen Klopp will surely be City\u2019s closest challengers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liverpool and J\u00fcrgen Klopp will surely be City\u2019s closest challengers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The promoted teams will once again face a significant step up. There has already been a degree of fatalism about the prospects of Sheffield United and Norwich, but Aston Villa look a decent bet to expand the growing Midlands revival. The strange scenes at Newcastle over the summer suggest a good start might be essential to avoid a painful season.</p> \n<p>Beyond this the most notable change will come via another televisual intrusion. For the first time the Video Assistant Referee will stalk the pitch. The issues with VAR remain the same: bad VAR is really bad; good VAR is a welcome addition. The obvious fear is that the same problems apparent at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/08/fifa-var-womens-world-cup-uswnt-hope-solo\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s World Cup</a> will overshadow such tedious matters as the actual football.</p> \n<p>This is a sport of rough edges, played out constantly at the edge of the rules, some of which now seem mutable and vague when subjected to this level of unblinking scrutiny. The balance here is delicate. As ever VAR\u2019s failure or otherwise will be dependent on the humans who design and operate the system.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The other major change is the introduction of a winter break in February. This has been a cause celebre for so long its arrival has perhaps gone a little under-trumpeted. In truth the winter break was never really the answer to much, and certainly not to the repeated failures of the England team, product of generations of inadequate coaching, tactics and management. If players are allowed to rest, if it stops one set of ligaments from pinging, a hamstring or two from entering the red zone, then it will be a sensible addition.</p> \n<p>And so to the final countdown. An opening Friday night TV fixture at Anfield, where Norwich are the visitors, is another indication of where the financial muscle of the Premier League resides. The Boxing Day fixture list live on Amazon Prime suggests where it may lie in the future.</p> \n<p>The task, as ever, is to negotiate a path through this inferno of greed and competing interests. For all its global brand power, the Premier League\u2019s new Jerusalem is a fragile entity, more dependent than it might want to believe on fine details, and on the goodwill of the fans who have sustained it from its mid-Victorian birth. The new season already feels like a decisive step into some other stage in that existence.</p>",

The Premier League has increasingly split itself into segments in recent years: A-listers; eager second raters; mid-table fodder; imperilled minority. Within this there has been a surge in the number of matches where possession becomes tediously skewed, where to escape with a respectable defeat is a desirable outcome. There were notable exceptions last year: Crystal Palace\u2019s willingness to press Manchester City home and away, for example. But the fact these were notable tells its own story. It is a process that will only grow more pronounced with the increased slice of overseas TV rights money for the bigger clubs and moves among club owners to dilute the equal-share principle. Can anyone close the gap on the top two? Manchester United\u2019s ghost ship of a squad continues to list, unable either to shed its skeleton crew or add sufficient new life. Chelsea have entered a fascinating kind of standby mode, one that might ultimately prove beneficial. Tottenham are probably best placed. Harry Kane is in one of his fit periods in between the injured periods. Tanguy Ndombele may take time to settle but he already looks a fine addition. Similarly Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 is an ambitious signing for Arsenal, and another indication of the vogue for well-judged moderate-to-big-money buys that has been a feature of City\u2019s own planning over the last few years. Still, challenging the top two looks a vertiginous task. Rodri will strengthen the seams of that wonderful City midfield. And both the champions and Liverpool will improve just by dint of another summer in the hands of Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp. Best of all would be another break-out team. Currently Leicester and Wolves look the best placed to press the teams who finished above them last season. Below will be the usual pack of middleweights roped together like survivors on the raft of the Medusa, concerned with little more than staying afloat, continuing to benefit from the extraordinary rewards of Premier League stasis. It is a concentration of wealth that affects everything else around it, from devalued domestic cups, to the basic good health of the ever-narrowing pyramid below. On the up-side there will once again be plenty of fine entertaining football played in that middling pack. It is a sign of the Premier League\u2019s riches that there can be a fear of stagnation even while teams like Bournemouth and Watford have such fine attacking talent in their ranks and a club with Burnley\u2019s managerial expertise continues to perform to such a high level. The promoted teams will once again face a significant step up. There has already been a degree of fatalism about the prospects of Sheffield United and Norwich, but Aston Villa look a decent bet to expand the growing Midlands revival. The strange scenes at Newcastle over the summer suggest a good start might be essential to avoid a painful season. Beyond this the most notable change will come via another televisual intrusion. For the first time the Video Assistant Referee will stalk the pitch. The issues with VAR remain the same: bad VAR is really bad; good VAR is a welcome addition. The obvious fear is that the same problems apparent at the Women\u2019s World Cup will overshadow such tedious matters as the actual football. This is a sport of rough edges, played out constantly at the edge of the rules, some of which now seem mutable and vague when subjected to this level of unblinking scrutiny. The balance here is delicate. As ever VAR\u2019s failure or otherwise will be dependent on the humans who design and operate the system. The other major change is the introduction of a winter break in February. This has been a cause celebre for so long its arrival has perhaps gone a little under-trumpeted. In truth the winter break was never really the answer to much, and certainly not to the repeated failures of the England team, product of generations of inadequate coaching, tactics and management. If players are allowed to rest, if it stops one set of ligaments from pinging, a hamstring or two from entering the red zone, then it will be a sensible addition. And so to the final countdown. An opening Friday night TV fixture at Anfield, where Norwich are the visitors, is another indication of where the financial muscle of the Premier League resides. The Boxing Day fixture list live on Amazon Prime suggests where it may lie in the future. The task, as ever, is to negotiate a path through this inferno of greed and competing interests. For all its global brand power, the Premier League\u2019s new Jerusalem is a fragile entity, more dependent than it might want to believe on fine details, and on the goodwill of the fans who have sustained it from its mid-Victorian birth. The new season already feels like a decisive step into some other stage in that existence.",

Look at the figures: according to the UK government\u2019s race disparity audit, relative to whites and Asians, black defendants at crown court were the most likely to be remanded in custody. Between 2017 and 2018, black people in Britain were approximately 10 times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people were, and three times more likely than Asians. Black Caribbean pupils were permanently excluded at nearly three times the rate of white British pupils, while black people are more likely to be unemployed and homeless than all other racial minority groups. This is not only a British phenomenon. In the US, black people are more likely to be arrested for drugs offences even though they are not more likely to use or sell drugs, and as a result make up a disproportionate amount of the prison population. They also have a higher chance of getting shot by the police than white or Hispanic people. In today\u2019s Brazil, black people are still treated as second-class citizens; while in India, students of African origin are persecuted. In South Africa, a majority black country, 72% of the country\u2019s private farmland is owned by white people, who make up 9% of the population. During the apartheid era there was a clear racial hierarchy: whites at the top, Indians and \u201ccoloureds\u201d in the middle, and black people at the bottom. Historically, though slavery covered a range of civilisations, countries and races, for the black race its legacy lives on. From the 16th to the 19th century, around 12 million Africans were transported across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas by European slave traders. Millions more were born into slavery and spent their whole lives enslaved. And after slavery ended in the US, African Americans were subjected to segregation laws, the denial of civil rights and lynching. And between AD 650 and the 1800s, almost 10 million Africans were sold by Arab slave traders to Arabia and the Indian subcontinent. In fact the Arabic word abeed, which means \u201cslave\u201d, is still used to describe black people in countries from Algeria to Yemen. In her book White Fragility, Robin DiAngelo notes that black people are the \u201cultimate racial other\u201d. In the US, they are called \u201cnigger\u201d, in Brazil they are termed macaco; in South Africa, they are nicknamed kaffir; in India, bandar; in China hak gwai. Even though there is a dictionary definition of anti-blackness, it hasn\u2019t yet gained much traction. The political class does not grasp its toxicity. We\u2019re currently in the middle of the UN International Decade for People of African Descent, so it is an appropriate time for anti-blackness to be classified separately from racism and given its own prominence. The one-size-fits-all approach to tackling racism leaves undersupported the racial group which suffers the most brutality, hatred and discrimination. Furthermore, in white-dominant societies, blackness has come to be a synonym for crime, laziness, poverty and low intelligence. A key step in bringing anti-blackness to the forefront is by developing a working definition. This could cover caricatures, stereotypes, disparagement, the perception of black populated countries and the trivialisation of transatlantic slavery. As a precursor, there needs to be buy-in from governments, regional bodies, international organisations, academia and the global black civil society. Ultimately, it is crucial to call out the most toxic brand of racism. We need to sear anti-blackness into our collective consciousness, so as to put an end to the mistakes of the past and the present, which have brought so much misery to so many people. \u2022 Ahmed Olayinka Sule is a writer and social critic",

      "body": "<p>During the depths of the great depression, the British economist John Maynard Keynes laid out a vision for his own profession: \u201cIf economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble, competent people, on a level with dentists, that would be splendid.\u201d Today, many think that Keynes would be disappointed if he could see what his fellow economists have become.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/03/economics-global-economy-climate-crisis?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">their critics</a>, economists are less like dentists and more like mad scientists.

So what does the evidence tell us? Are they dentists, mad scientists or something else entirely?</p> <p>Economics started out as a relatively humble occupation, but by the 20th century it had become increasing <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/657967.pdf?casa_token=DTIeGRE3zy4AAAAA:qesY0Ck0sTNDChNJRZfZg9UZXDJ8Skp0-xBZUhhb3qrD4Dwqsmtse0SOIMNkczNzuqx3LXL3fAfCKou2v1cwAH23EjuUlSbnMvVWa691AAdBO3PLow\" title=\"\">influential in shaping national policy</a>. In the second half of the 20th century, economics gradually became a transnational occupation with a fairly coherent set of ideas about how the world worked. Influential members of the profession would often be trained in the doctoral programmes of elite US economics departments and then be dispatched to work on <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/502693\" title=\"\">policy problems around the world</a>. When working in their home countries, they would often look back to the elite economics departments for support and guidance. This myopic focus on elite US economics departments has created a <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.29.1.89\" title=\"\">steep professional hierarchy</a>, where the sign of being a good economist is having your work published in five scientific journals that are mainly controlled by <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w25093\" title=\"\">US-based or US-trained economists</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Economists are a fairly ideological, diverse group of people who are striving to address the grand challenges we face</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As well as being very hierarchical, economics is insular. Economists tend to mainly refer to the work of other economists. <a href=\"https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo16468807.html\" title=\"\">One study</a> found that economists cite the work of other disciplines 19% of the time. In comparison, sociologists cite other disciplines 52% of the time and political scientists cite external disciplines 59% of time. When asked whether interdisciplinary knowledge is better than knowledge derived from a single discipline, only about <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.29.1.89\" title=\"\">42% of economists agreed</a>, whereas, 72% of sociologists, 78% of psychologists and 68% of historians thought interdisciplinary knowledge was better.</p> <p>Within the profession, economists also have fairly narrow horizons. A recent experiment found economists were more likely to accept a message if it was labelled as being from someone working in mainstream economics rather than a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356309\" title=\"\">non-mainstream economist</a>. Even in online discussions, economists tend to prefer to stick to their own. A recent analysis comparing how economists and other scientists used Twitter found that economists were much more likely to focus their responses towards <a href=\"https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/89527/\" title=\"\">other members of their profession</a>. This insularity means economists often hold views that are <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.3.636\" title=\"\">very different from those of the wider populace</a>.</p> <p>Economics is also a discipline dominated by men. Women are <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.30.4.221\" title=\"\">significantly under-represented</a> at all levels of the profession \u2013 from undergraduate students all the way up to professorship level. The same is true for minority-ethnic groups. While women have made up increasing proportions of other disciplines during the last 20 years, gender imbalances have not <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.1.3\" title=\"\">budged in economics</a>. Some corners of disciplines such as finance and macro-economics are <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w23953\" title=\"\">particularly dominated by men</a>. Even informal online interaction tends to marginalise female economists. A recent study found that online rumours about female economists tended to focus on their personal lives, while online rumours about male economists were <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/alicewu/files/ejr2019.pdf\" title=\"\">focused on their professional lives</a>.</p> <p>Economists may not be the most intellectually diverse, outwardly focused or demographically diverse group. There is, however, more ideological diversity than we might suspect. A recent analysis of the political ideology of US economists found that about 60% have a broadly liberal or left orientation, while 40% swing <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/economists-arent-as-nonpartisan-as-we-think/\" title=\"\">more to the right</a>. What\u2019s more, their personal ideological preferences are reflected in their work. Left-leaning economists tended to work on topics that were typically more progressive (such as studying labour markets), while right-leaning economists worked in areas that were more conservative (such as finance). Their policy recommendations also tend to follow their ideology. The slight majority of left-leaning economists were more likely to support higher government spending and higher taxation, while the slight minority of right-leaning economists tended to urge government fiscal restraint and lower taxes.</p> <p>As well as being more ideologically diverse than we might think, economists are also more focused on collecting real-world data than their critics often assume. In 1983, theoretical papers that relied on abstract mathematical models made up about 57% of those published in the top five economics journals. By 2011, that number had <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.51.1.162\" title=\"\">dropped to 19%</a>. An analysis of macro-economics found that abstract mathematical models dominated the discipline between the <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w22253\" title=\"\">1960s and the early 1990s</a>. Since then, economists have favoured a more experimental approach. With the increasing availability of <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~leinav/pubs/Science2014.pdf\" title=\"\">big data sets</a>, economists are more interested in empirical questions than ever before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2019/jun/06/socialism-for-the-rich-the-evils-of-bad-economics\">\u2018Socialism for the rich\u2019: the evils of bad economics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Economists also tackle a wider range of topics than many assume. For instance, the Nobel prizewinner Robert Shiller has recently been exploring the role that the <a href=\"https://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/d20/d2069.pdf\" title=\"\">narratives we tell each other play in shaping economic crises</a>. George Akerlof (another Nobel prizewinner) and US economist Rachel Kranton have been looking at the role identity plays in shaping economic decisions such as <a href=\"http://public.econ.duke.edu/~rek8/economicsandidentity.pdf\" title=\"\">where we work and what we buy</a>. The economist Deirdre McCloskey has highlighted the role that <a href=\"https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo3750637.html\" title=\"\">moral virtues play in economic growth</a>.</p> <p>Economists have also made important contributions to tackling some of the biggest social issues we face, including how <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/13326.html\" title=\"\">we raise our children</a>, how to <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6451/325/tab-article-info\" title=\"\">tackle the climate crisis</a>, how to make the international financial system <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10230.html\" title=\"\">less crisis-prone</a>, how to deal with the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/22/deaths-despair-rising-america-opioid-crisis\" title=\"\">\u201cdeaths of despair\u201d</a> in the United States, and how to deal with the impact of <a href=\"https://izajolp.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2193-9004-2-2\" title=\"\">poor mental health</a> on people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>Economists may not become the humble and practical dentists than Keynes had <a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.29.1.89\" title=\"\">hoped they might</a>. But they have not become the kind of mad scientists many of their critics think they are.

      "bodyText": "During the depths of the great depression, the British economist John Maynard Keynes laid out a vision for his own profession: \u201cIf economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble, competent people, on a level with dentists, that would be splendid.\u201d Today, many think that Keynes would be disappointed if he could see what his fellow economists have become. According to their critics, economists are less like dentists and more like mad scientists. Economics, its detractors claims, is a failing field in desperate need of fundamental reform. Unsurprisingly, economists disagree. They think such criticisms are part of the lurch \u201caway from evidence-based policy\u201d and come \u201cdangerously close to surrender to special interest groups, gut feelings and superstitions\u201d. So what does the evidence tell us? Are they dentists, mad scientists or something else entirely? Economics started out as a relatively humble occupation, but by the 20th century it had become increasing influential in shaping national policy. In the second half of the 20th century, economics gradually became a transnational occupation with a fairly coherent set of ideas about how the world worked. Influential members of the profession would often be trained in the doctoral programmes of elite US economics departments and then be dispatched to work on policy problems around the world. When working in their home countries, they would often look back to the elite economics departments for support and guidance. This myopic focus on elite US economics departments has created a steep professional hierarchy, where the sign of being a good economist is having your work published in five scientific journals that are mainly controlled by US-based or US-trained economists. As well as being very hierarchical, economics is insular. Economists tend to mainly refer to the work of other economists. One study found that economists cite the work of other disciplines 19% of the time. In comparison, sociologists cite other disciplines 52% of the time and political scientists cite external disciplines 59% of time. When asked whether interdisciplinary knowledge is better than knowledge derived from a single discipline, only about 42% of economists agreed, whereas, 72% of sociologists, 78% of psychologists and 68% of historians thought interdisciplinary knowledge was better. Within the profession, economists also have fairly narrow horizons. A recent experiment found economists were more likely to accept a message if it was labelled as being from someone working in mainstream economics rather than a non-mainstream economist. Even in online discussions, economists tend to prefer to stick to their own. A recent analysis comparing how economists and other scientists used Twitter found that economists were much more likely to focus their responses towards other members of their profession. This insularity means economists often hold views that are very different from those of the wider populace. Economics is also a discipline dominated by men. Women are significantly under-represented at all levels of the profession \u2013 from undergraduate students all the way up to professorship level. The same is true for minority-ethnic groups. While women have made up increasing proportions of other disciplines during the last 20 years, gender imbalances have not budged in economics. Some corners of disciplines such as finance and macro-economics are particularly dominated by men. Even informal online interaction tends to marginalise female economists. A recent study found that online rumours about female economists tended to focus on their personal lives, while online rumours about male economists were focused on their professional lives. Economists may not be the most intellectually diverse, outwardly focused or demographically diverse group. There is, however, more ideological diversity than we might suspect. A recent analysis of the political ideology of US economists found that about 60% have a broadly liberal or left orientation, while 40% swing more to the right. What\u2019s more, their personal ideological preferences are reflected in their work. Left-leaning economists tended to work on topics that were typically more progressive (such as studying labour markets), while right-leaning economists worked in areas that were more conservative (such as finance). Their policy recommendations also tend to follow their ideology. The slight majority of left-leaning economists were more likely to support higher government spending and higher taxation, while the slight minority of right-leaning economists tended to urge government fiscal restraint and lower taxes. As well as being more ideologically diverse than we might think, economists are also more focused on collecting real-world data than their critics often assume. In 1983, theoretical papers that relied on abstract mathematical models made up about 57% of those published in the top five economics journals. By 2011, that number had dropped to 19%. An analysis of macro-economics found that abstract mathematical models dominated the discipline between the 1960s and the early 1990s. Since then, economists have favoured a more experimental approach. With the increasing availability of big data sets, economists are more interested in empirical questions than ever before. Economists also tackle a wider range of topics than many assume. For instance, the Nobel prizewinner Robert Shiller has recently been exploring the role that the narratives we tell each other play in shaping economic crises. George Akerlof (another Nobel prizewinner) and US economist Rachel Kranton have been looking at the role identity plays in shaping economic decisions such as where we work and what we buy. The economist Deirdre McCloskey has highlighted the role that moral virtues play in economic growth. Economists have also made important contributions to tackling some of the biggest social issues we face, including how we raise our children, how to tackle the climate crisis, how to make the international financial system less crisis-prone, how to deal with the rise of \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d in the United States, and how to deal with the impact of poor mental health on people\u2019s lives. Economists may not become the humble and practical dentists than Keynes had hoped they might. But they have not become the kind of mad scientists many of their critics think they are. Economists are a fairly ideological, diverse group of people who are focused on real-world problems and who strive to address the grand challenges we face. But if they want to play a valuable role in shaping the future, they need to become less elitist, less insular and less masculine. That means being less obsessed with a handful of top journals, being more open to ideas from outside their discipline, and being more welcoming to women and other groups who are under-represented in the profession. \u2022 Andr\u00e9 Spicer is professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City, University of London",

      "bodyText": "William Hill reported a loss of \u00a364m in the first half of the year as it coped worse than its rivals with the impact of curbs on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), a change that has cost the company nearly \u00a31bn. Shares in William Hill rose by more than 5% in early trading as the markets responded with relief that its results were no worse than expected. But the figures indicated it had struggled to manage regulatory change to FOBTs, with revenues from high-street bookmaking down 12% as a small increase in sports betting was wiped out by a 25% slump in income from the machines. Maximum stakes on the controversial machines were slashed from \u00a3100 to \u00a32 in April \u2013 halfway through the six-month period \u2013 after the government concluded they were a \u201csocial blight\u201d with links to addiction. William Hill would have reported a \u00a351m profit if not for the FOBT curbs but instead slumped to a \u00a363.5m loss as it took a \u00a397m one-off accounting charge related to the impact on the value of its bookmaking business. Coupled with the \u00a3883m hit reported in its full-year results in March, William Hill has now taken \u00a3980m in cumulative FOBT charges and announced plans to close 700 shops, putting about 4,000 jobs at risk. Prior to the change, William Hill made more money from the machines than it did from traditional bookmaking. By contrast Flutter Entertainment, formerly known as Paddy Power Betfair, was making twice as much from sports betting than it did from machines and has suffered a much smaller decline in revenue since the FOBT curbs, down 4% in the first half. The retail estate of GVC, which owns Ladbrokes Coral, has suffered worse than Flutter but not as badly as William Hill, with first-half revenues down 10%. Despite difficulties in its high-street business, William Hill\u2019s overall group revenue rose slightly, up 1%, thanks to the acquisition of online casino Mr Green. But the company\u2019s online operation, which accounts for 45% of revenue, suffered a 9% decline in profit to \u00a354.3m as customers made smaller bets and costs rose. The increase in costs was also linked to FOBTs because the government increased the duty on online betting from 15% to 21% to offset expected loss of tax on the machines. William Hill, like its British rivals, has been expanding rapidly in the US, where the supreme court reversed a decades-old ban on sports betting last year. The US now accounts for 7% of group revenue, with income reaching $1bn in the first half of the year, although the cost of the investment is among the factors that curbed profit. The relative weakness of the pound against the dollar has boosted that side of the business too. In its more established Nevada business, revenues were up 16% in dollar terms but 23% in sterling. But William Hill\u2019s FOBT-related difficulties were among factors that meant shareholders\u2019 half-year dividend was cut from 4.26p per share to 2.66p. The firm\u2019s chief executive, Philip Bowcock, said: \u201cWe are making good progress against the five-year strategy we outlined last year, delivering strong revenue growth in the US and other international markets and positioning William Hill well for future growth. \u201cIn retail we took the tough decision to announce a consultation process over the proposed closure of around 700 shops to protect the long-term future of the business following the introduction of the \u00a32 stake limit.

      "body": "<p>It is a truism that people who talk money are boring, likewise that money talk infiltrates our lives to dispiriting extent. Football \u2013 a warm buzz of fantasy, community and identity \u2013 should give us refuge from this, but it has become impossible to grasp one without referencing the other. \u201cCompany structure\u201d, \u201cEBITDA\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://soccer.nbcsports.com/2013/06/07/wayne-rooney-is-officially-mr-potato-head/\">Mr Potato Head</a>\u201d now form part of the supporter\u2019s lexicon \u2013 still prefixed and suffixed with profanity, but miserable nevertheless.</p> <p>Manchester United are an egregious example of the incursion, these days more cashpoint than football club. Since the Glazers took over in 2005, they have been cleansed of more than \u00a31bn, quid pro quo for the glorious privilege of being owned by a Trump-indulging family yet to contribute a penny of its own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/transfer-window-team-guide-premier-league-summer-deals\">Transfer window: team-by-team guide to the Premier League summer deals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/08/david-moyes-alex-ferguson-manchester-united\">Alex Ferguson is partially responsible for this pillaging</a>, his genius mitigated its initial impact. But even while he was accumulating silverware, the rot set in: Cristiano Ronaldo was sold for roughly \u00a385m, then replaced by Antonio Valencia, Gabriel Obertan and Michael Owen for roughly \u00a320m; generational players grew old together; and not a single midfielder was purchased between July 2007 and July 2012. So, when Ferguson retired a champion in 2013, he bequeathed a squad needing major surgery.</p> <p>Underinvestment is not the sole reason for United\u2019s subsequent decline \u2013 horrendous judgment is also significant. Ed Woodward, the club\u2019s dominant suit, has no footballing expertise and has, in the last five years, been forced to sack three managers he appointed. The money, though, keeps rolling, and consequently Woodward remains in situ, United failing at football but succeeding at business; existing to make money, not making money to exist.</p> <p>Last season, they finished sixth in the league, 32 points behind Manchester City and with a squad still in need of serious attention. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2013 yet another new manager \u2013 could not have been clearer on this point, <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/12/manchester-united-boss-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-warns-ruthless-transfer-decisions-summer-9194618/\">acknowledging his need to be \u201cruthless\u201d</a> with players lacking the virtues and vertebrae to succeed.</p> <p>Instead, United moved on only four and brought in just three. Dan James arrived for \u00a315m, roughly half of which was covered by Marouane Fellani\u2019s January departure, and Harry Maguire joined for \u00a380m, most of which was recouped by the sale of Romelu Lukaku. As such, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/04/football-transfer-window-2019-every-summer-deal-from-europe-top-five-leagues\">the net spend is the \u00a350m outlay on Aaron Wan-Bissaka and maximum \u00a320m more</a>.</p> <p>These numbers, though nauseous, must be viewed in context.

      "bodyText": "It is a truism that people who talk money are boring, likewise that money talk infiltrates our lives to dispiriting extent. Football \u2013 a warm buzz of fantasy, community and identity \u2013 should give us refuge from this, but it has become impossible to grasp one without referencing the other. \u201cCompany structure\u201d, \u201cEBITDA\u201d and \u201cMr Potato Head\u201d now form part of the supporter\u2019s lexicon \u2013 still prefixed and suffixed with profanity, but miserable nevertheless. Manchester United are an egregious example of the incursion, these days more cashpoint than football club. Since the Glazers took over in 2005, they have been cleansed of more than \u00a31bn, quid pro quo for the glorious privilege of being owned by a Trump-indulging family yet to contribute a penny of its own. Though Alex Ferguson is partially responsible for this pillaging, his genius mitigated its initial impact. But even while he was accumulating silverware, the rot set in: Cristiano Ronaldo was sold for roughly \u00a385m, then replaced by Antonio Valencia, Gabriel Obertan and Michael Owen for roughly \u00a320m; generational players grew old together; and not a single midfielder was purchased between July 2007 and July 2012. So, when Ferguson retired a champion in 2013, he bequeathed a squad needing major surgery. Underinvestment is not the sole reason for United\u2019s subsequent decline \u2013 horrendous judgment is also significant. Ed Woodward, the club\u2019s dominant suit, has no footballing expertise and has, in the last five years, been forced to sack three managers he appointed. The money, though, keeps rolling, and consequently Woodward remains in situ, United failing at football but succeeding at business; existing to make money, not making money to exist. Last season, they finished sixth in the league, 32 points behind Manchester City and with a squad still in need of serious attention. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2013 yet another new manager \u2013 could not have been clearer on this point, acknowledging his need to be \u201cruthless\u201d with players lacking the virtues and vertebrae to succeed. Instead, United moved on only four and brought in just three. Dan James arrived for \u00a315m, roughly half of which was covered by Marouane Fellani\u2019s January departure, and Harry Maguire joined for \u00a380m, most of which was recouped by the sale of Romelu Lukaku. As such, the net spend is the \u00a350m outlay on Aaron Wan-Bissaka and maximum \u00a320m more. These numbers, though nauseous, must be viewed in context. United require nothing from their owners save the ability to spend their own money, and are English football\u2019s most profitable club by far \u2013 a status which should be reflected in their transfer activity. Except \u2013 with a rebuild required \u2013 they have been outspent by Aston Villa and Wolves, just as last season they were outspent by Everton, West Ham, Leicester, Southampton, Fulham, Brighton and Wolves. The work done by United\u2019s regular rivals is equally illuminating. Much as Sky would have us believe otherwise, it is impossible to judge who has \u201chad a good window\u201d until the players have, well \u2026 played, but is it absolutely possible to see who has filled their gaps. Previous splurges, responsible husbandry and the deployment of footballing expertise left Manchester City and Liverpool with little work to do. On the other hand, Arsenal needed defenders so bought David Luiz, Kieran Tierney and William Saliba; needed a midfielder so loaned Dani Ceballos; needed a goalscoring winger so broke their transfer record for Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. Similarly, Spurs needed to strengthen in midfield so bought two midfielders, breaking their transfer record for Tanguy Ndombele, and needed something for their left flank, so bought Ryan Sessegnon. Both teams finished above United last season. Meanwhile, the holes in United\u2019s squad gape: they have no specialist right-winger, no credible number 10, and have not replaced Lukaku. Yet these are peripheral issues when assessing an abomination of a midfield whose state is the principal reason they cannot control games; why they concede too many and score too few. If they are so keen to keep Paul Pogba, they should furnish him with suitable partners. United did try to reinforce in this area: they bid for Newcastle youngster Sean Longstaff, a canny move. Longstaff acquitted himself superbly last season and Michael Carrick, one of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s coaches, played the same position for United\u2019s most successful team, while Carrick\u2019s brother Graeme \u2013 also a coach \u2013 knows Longstaff, so can vouch for temperament as well as talent.

While she may be able to make distinctions between herself and Joe Biden on civil rights, her brand of economic moderation is in some ways more dangerous. Appealing to black women superficially, without the substance to back it, gives her enough legitimacy to win black women over while offering little in return. This leaves progressive black women in the awkward position of not critiquing her so that she gets the nomination, which becomes not critiquing her so she wins the general election, which turns into leaving her presidency unchallenged so she can govern. While protecting the career of a single black politician, black women as a whole are likely to face unabated, growing inequality. We can\u2019t afford the four years of piecemeal moderation that Kamala Harris offers, and we have the debt to prove it.

Haim, right, presumably a bit warm, take off jackets, coats and jumpers, before a cutaway replenishes the supply, so they take those off too; the process repeating, more jumpers, more layers, never cooling down, always too warm, endless woollens. It\u2019s like anti-ASMR. It makes you scream: \u201cGODDAMN WHEN WILL YOU REACH BRAS\u201d out loud at work, like some rampant open-plan perv-wretch. But all you wanted \u2013 ALL YOU EVER WANTED \u2013 was for Haim to be comfy, and cool. Of optimal temperature. Security have just arrived to escort me from the building, so quickly: the song. It\u2019s really good. Imagine Drinking in LA cadging a fiver from Walk on the Wild Side in an alleyway and you\u2019ve basically already heard it.</p> <h2><strong>Ariana Grande ft Social House<br>Boyfriend</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SRxBTtspYM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9SRxBTtspYM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There is no more universal emotion than not wanting someone yourself, but not wanting anyone else to have them either. It\u2019s part of what makes us the worst species on the planet. Ariana\u2019s turned this into a marvellously syrupy TLC-circa-1996 sex-jam, which captures the futility of it all, but also the fun bits. Its Calvins are only slightly soiled by Social House\u2019s insistence on levels of Auto-Tune that would make Kanye vomit. NB: I can 100% confirm this is the only video this week in which Ariana Grande impales a woman to a door using a bow and arrow.</p> <h2><strong>Iggy Pop<br>James Bond</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86aFnMzn7Cs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/86aFnMzn7Cs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Post Pop Depression was such a success that many hoped Iggy would hang up his wig [note from our lawyers: Not a Wig] and retire.

A simple-as-they-come three-note bass riff is all Iggy needs to croon a sultry, seedy ode to a woman who remains a rousing mystery. Great, funky, only 28% creepy.</p> <h2><strong>Angel Olsen<br>All Mirrors</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjt698Zv5jQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jjt698Zv5jQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If a cocktail of one part Kate Bush and one part Take My Breath Away sounds like your tipple, here you go.

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>As the Brexit, climate crisis, Trump (of the American and British varieties) hits just keep coming, my friends and I find ourselves turning increasingly to an unexpected form of self-medication. Not booze or Valium \u2013 we long ago maxed out on those \u2013 but to television. By far the most popular audiovisual drug of choice, including my own, is Brooklyn Nine-Nine; seven seasons of hilarity about a ragtag bundle of misfits in an unglamorous precinct dedicated to each other and their job to rid the borough of crime while delivering jokes at a rate that puts even most US comedies to shame.</p> <p>It\u2019s an ensemble show and there\u2019s a character for everyone. Chaotic friends place the dying embers of their hope for humanity at stoic-to-the-point-of-roboticism Captain Holt\u2019s feet (also those in search of a father figure, but I don\u2019t like to point this out to them), while doormats (I mean nice people) cling to Gina and her refusal to deviate from the pursuit of an entirely Gina-centric life. Personally I am devoted to Jake, his puppyish enthusiasm, his liveliness and fleetness of non-toxic banter which all bespeak a profound purity of soul. Beyond that, I turn ritualistically to his world on Netflix every night mostly for its grace \u2013 for the sight of a group of people working together in harmony and creating something even greater than the sum of its parts.

      "bodyText": "Monday As the Brexit, climate crisis, Trump (of the American and British varieties) hits just keep coming, my friends and I find ourselves turning increasingly to an unexpected form of self-medication. Not booze or Valium \u2013 we long ago maxed out on those \u2013 but to television. By far the most popular audiovisual drug of choice, including my own, is Brooklyn Nine-Nine; seven seasons of hilarity about a ragtag bundle of misfits in an unglamorous precinct dedicated to each other and their job to rid the borough of crime while delivering jokes at a rate that puts even most US comedies to shame. It\u2019s an ensemble show and there\u2019s a character for everyone. Chaotic friends place the dying embers of their hope for humanity at stoic-to-the-point-of-roboticism Captain Holt\u2019s feet (also those in search of a father figure, but I don\u2019t like to point this out to them), while doormats (I mean nice people) cling to Gina and her refusal to deviate from the pursuit of an entirely Gina-centric life. Personally I am devoted to Jake, his puppyish enthusiasm, his liveliness and fleetness of non-toxic banter which all bespeak a profound purity of soul. Beyond that, I turn ritualistically to his world on Netflix every night mostly for its grace \u2013 for the sight of a group of people working together in harmony and creating something even greater than the sum of its parts.

Awake to the problems of pedestrians stumbling over the abandoned scooters, the cities of Brussels and Antwerp have announced plans to restrict where users can dump them after use. The Brussels-Capital region has drawn up a map of \u201cred zones\u201d where parking is banned. Helmet regulations are also being examined. The first scooter-related death in Belgium came last April when a 41-year-old-man was found seriously injured on a bench with one of the scooters lying at his feet.

For many the saving grace for the scooter has been the apparent environmental argument for their use \u2013 until now. Research published recently by North Carolina State University suggests that travelling by scooter produces more greenhouse gas emissions per mile than making the journey by bus, bicycle, moped or on foot. The environmental cost lies in the materials used to manufacture the frame, wheels and battery, as well as the effort at the end of each day to round them up, charge them and return them to the streets. For the mayor of Bruges there is a further argument against the phenomenon, which might give others food for thought. \u201cBruges is a very small city, especially the historical part, and it is very easy just to walk from one end to the other,\u201d De fauw said. \u201cMost inhabitants of Bruges also have a bicycle, more than 90%, so why would they want to use that kind of thing?

      "body": "<p>I started whistling when I was about four years old. We lived in the Eindhoven area of the Netherlands, and my dad whistled all the time. It was impossible for him to whistle out of tune. He whistled a lot of Bach, but also the Beatles. We whistled TV theme tunes together \u2013 him whistling one note, and me the next. I immediately produced a nice tone. Within a few years, I was better than he was.</p> <p>By 2003, when I was 34, I was working as a psychiatric nurse, and had three young kids. That year we had a big Christmas dinner for the family, and I remember whistling along to cheesy tunes like Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer. My sister-in-law asked me to stop several times. At one point, I said: \u201cIf there was a competition, I would enter.\u201d Two weeks later, I received a text from her: \u201cGeert, you\u2019re going to America. I\u2019ve just entered you for the World Whistling Championships.\u201d</p> <p>The auditorium was in a high school in Louisburg, North Carolina. Everything was overwhelming. There were about 30 contestants \u2013 some terrible, some very good. Some people were really, really competitive. It lasted two days \u2013 and I won. The prize was a big trophy covered with American flags and eagles. I had to go through customs with three trophies: one for classical, one for popular and one for grand champion.</p> <p>After that, I started receiving my first invitations to do concerts \u2013 mostly classical, accompanied by symphony orchestras, string quartets or, sometimes, just a piano. I was aware that I was the odd one out on the line-ups, and I had yet to turn professional.</p> <p>Then in 2007, I was asked to whistle in a big church in Leiden by an entertainment company. I knew it would be special \u2013 the queen of the Netherlands, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/jan/28/queen-beatrix-netherlands\" title=\"\">Queen Beatrix</a>, would be there.</p> <p>Normally at a concert there is a little security, but this was another level, with sniffer dogs. A lot of the performers, who included musicians and ballet dancers, were pretty nervous. When the queen came in, a weird frisson went through the audience. I whistled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2Ji6fNv_1k\" title=\"\">Czardas by Vittorio Monti</a>; it\u2019s a virtuoso violin piece that starts dramatically, then gets faster and faster; in the third part there are some really high notes.</p> <p>There was a circus performer in a feathered bird costume, hidden in the church ceiling. When I started my second piece, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UKGc8J463k\" title=\"\">In A Sentimental Mood by Duke Ellington</a>, she descended on a hoop and landed on the grand piano. Then I helped my \u201cbird\u201d down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/10/experience-i-am-a-naked-rollercoaster-rider\">Experience: I am a naked rollercoaster rider</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The queen was very appreciative: it was a special moment. I\u2019m not a big royalist, but I saw what she means to a lot of people.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019m a professional whistler. I made the transition last summer; I had been working with homeless people, and felt close to burnout. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/cirque-du-soleil\" title=\"\">Cirque du Soleil</a> emailed me to say they were looking for a whistler.

      "bodyText": "I started whistling when I was about four years old. We lived in the Eindhoven area of the Netherlands, and my dad whistled all the time. It was impossible for him to whistle out of tune. He whistled a lot of Bach, but also the Beatles. We whistled TV theme tunes together \u2013 him whistling one note, and me the next. I immediately produced a nice tone. Within a few years, I was better than he was. By 2003, when I was 34, I was working as a psychiatric nurse, and had three young kids. That year we had a big Christmas dinner for the family, and I remember whistling along to cheesy tunes like Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer. My sister-in-law asked me to stop several times. At one point, I said: \u201cIf there was a competition, I would enter.\u201d Two weeks later, I received a text from her: \u201cGeert, you\u2019re going to America. I\u2019ve just entered you for the World Whistling Championships.\u201d The auditorium was in a high school in Louisburg, North Carolina. Everything was overwhelming. There were about 30 contestants \u2013 some terrible, some very good. Some people were really, really competitive. It lasted two days \u2013 and I won. The prize was a big trophy covered with American flags and eagles. I had to go through customs with three trophies: one for classical, one for popular and one for grand champion. After that, I started receiving my first invitations to do concerts \u2013 mostly classical, accompanied by symphony orchestras, string quartets or, sometimes, just a piano. I was aware that I was the odd one out on the line-ups, and I had yet to turn professional. Then in 2007, I was asked to whistle in a big church in Leiden by an entertainment company. I knew it would be special \u2013 the queen of the Netherlands, Queen Beatrix, would be there. Normally at a concert there is a little security, but this was another level, with sniffer dogs. A lot of the performers, who included musicians and ballet dancers, were pretty nervous. When the queen came in, a weird frisson went through the audience. I whistled Czardas by Vittorio Monti; it\u2019s a virtuoso violin piece that starts dramatically, then gets faster and faster; in the third part there are some really high notes. There was a circus performer in a feathered bird costume, hidden in the church ceiling. When I started my second piece, In A Sentimental Mood by Duke Ellington, she descended on a hoop and landed on the grand piano. Then I helped my \u201cbird\u201d down. The queen was very appreciative: it was a special moment. I\u2019m not a big royalist, but I saw what she means to a lot of people. Now, I\u2019m a professional whistler. I made the transition last summer; I had been working with homeless people, and felt close to burnout. Then Cirque du Soleil emailed me to say they were looking for a whistler. I went to Montreal to audition and they hired me in October; I\u2019m travelling with them at the moment. I open the Corteo show as the ringmaster. At one point I whistle Twinkle Twinkle Little Star as beautifully as I can. Then I go into a duet with the violinist, backed by an orchestra. I do between 75 and 100 concerts a year and earn twice as much as I did as a nurse. I also run whistling workshops. I practise all day, but it\u2019s hard for me not to whistle. I like to whistle recorder concertos by Vivaldi, but also jazz or blues. I love to improvise. The whistling community is getting bigger and bigger, and we often meet each other at tournaments. I\u2019ve judged the past two World Whistling Championships. There\u2019s a Japanese whistler, Akiko Shibata, who I think is brilliant. She\u2019s one of my favourite whistlers right now. If people want to get into whistling, and they can afford it, they should go to the championships.

Sometimes he showcases a strange, deeply melodic croon, one that manages to feel rich and strained, soulful and flat, all at the same time. Elsewhere, he deploys a softly guttural gurgle, or a bratty whine. This slippery identity extends to his message \u2013 which feels confusing and contradictory. \u201cSay no to suicide\u201d, he mutters melancholically (and apparently earnestly) on Snake Skin, before scoffing that his rivals are so intimidated that they \u201cgon\u2019 kill theyselves they see me stuntin\u2019\u201d.

They won\u2019t find it in the music. ! opens with painfully abrasive Diplo-produced EDM, graduates to harmonic, undulating trap, and then Kanye-style production, via a Barry White sample. Throw It Away moves thrillingly from 90s R&amp;B to an Oasis-style acoustic riff. Riot sees shimmering guitar reverb overlaid with zombie-like chanting. Guest voices include young pretender Playboi Carti\u2019s chipmunk slur (on the irresistible They Afraid of You) and the Game\u2019s old-school west coast rasp. As part of the sonically esoteric but staggeringly high-selling emo-rap brigade, White knows how to blur the boundaries of hip-hop, to send shockwaves through its foundations.</p> <p>Compellingly unpredictable, ! is doubtless part of the genre\u2019s forward march \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to get past the sense that White has sacrificed a coherent artistic identity in the name of progress.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The voice of Trippie Redd \u2013 AKA 20-year-old Ohioan rapper Michael White \u2013 is nothing if not inconsistent. Sometimes he showcases a strange, deeply melodic croon, one that manages to feel rich and strained, soulful and flat, all at the same time. Elsewhere, he deploys a softly guttural gurgle, or a bratty whine. This slippery identity extends to his message \u2013 which feels confusing and contradictory. \u201cSay no to suicide\u201d, he mutters melancholically (and apparently earnestly) on Snake Skin, before scoffing that his rivals are so intimidated that they \u201cgon\u2019 kill theyselves they see me stuntin\u2019\u201d. Be Yourself, meanwhile, initially comes over like a self-acceptance anthem, before ordering its subject to \u201cchange\u201d and \u201ckill yourself\u201d. This sense of instability echoes throughout White\u2019s second record, leaving the listener scrabbling around for some kind of congruity. They won\u2019t find it in the music. ! opens with painfully abrasive Diplo-produced EDM, graduates to harmonic, undulating trap, and then Kanye-style production, via a Barry White sample. Throw It Away moves thrillingly from 90s R&amp;B to an Oasis-style acoustic riff. Riot sees shimmering guitar reverb overlaid with zombie-like chanting. Guest voices include young pretender Playboi Carti\u2019s chipmunk slur (on the irresistible They Afraid of You) and the Game\u2019s old-school west coast rasp. As part of the sonically esoteric but staggeringly high-selling emo-rap brigade, White knows how to blur the boundaries of hip-hop, to send shockwaves through its foundations. Compellingly unpredictable, ! is doubtless part of the genre\u2019s forward march \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to get past the sense that White has sacrificed a coherent artistic identity in the name of progress.",

      "body": "<p>Reports of the death of the Bond girl have been greatly exaggerated. She has simply matured, as reports from the latest James Bond film suggest that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/15/lashana-lynch-new-007-james-bond-daniel-craig\" title=\"\">they are now to be known as Bond women</a>, and newly installed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/31/phoebe-waller-bridge-james-bond-film-must-treat-women-properly\" title=\"\">screenwriter Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> has said the franchise \u201chas just got to evolve, and the important thing is that the film treats the women properly\u201d.</p> <p>Sexpionage on screen has a mixed reputation. This is the business of \u201choneytraps\u201d, in which \u201cswallows\u201d (female spies) and \u201cravens\u201d (male ones) seduce the enemy to gain their secrets. The movies love it, of course: sex scenes are more alluring than mid-level operatives combing through phone records. But when films get it wrong, the results can be creepy, and all too often misogynist. There is little glamour or heroism in being forced to have sex against one\u2019s will, and the emotional fallout from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/21/i-was-abused-undercover-policeman-mark-kennedy\" title=\"\">\u201cundercover relationships\u201d</a> has rightly proved a scandal in recent years. Meanwhile, sexpionage films such as Mission: Impossible II fail to conceive their female characters as anything more than passive sex objects and Bond girls remain dazzling but disposable.</p> <p>The re-release this weekend of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Notorious, arguably the greatest sexpionage movie of them all, throws the subgenre into relief. In 1944, Hitchcock had an idea for the second film he would make with Ingrid Bergman, an actor with whom he was besotted. He told story editor Margaret McDonell that he was \u201cvery anxious to do a story about confidence tricks on a grand scale\u201d, with Bergman as the trickster: \u201cHer training would be as elaborate as the training of a Mata Hari.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before he was pitching the idea to a studio executive even more salaciously as \u201cthe story of a woman sold for political purposes into sexual enslavement\u201d with an eye-catching one-word title: Notorious.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhMyp8ZvjWs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EhMyp8ZvjWs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Mata Hari, a Dutch-born dancer and courtesan (real name Margaretha Zelle) was certainly that.

      "bodyText": "Reports of the death of the Bond girl have been greatly exaggerated. She has simply matured, as reports from the latest James Bond film suggest that they are now to be known as Bond women, and newly installed screenwriter Phoebe Waller-Bridge has said the franchise \u201chas just got to evolve, and the important thing is that the film treats the women properly\u201d. Sexpionage on screen has a mixed reputation. This is the business of \u201choneytraps\u201d, in which \u201cswallows\u201d (female spies) and \u201cravens\u201d (male ones) seduce the enemy to gain their secrets. The movies love it, of course: sex scenes are more alluring than mid-level operatives combing through phone records. But when films get it wrong, the results can be creepy, and all too often misogynist. There is little glamour or heroism in being forced to have sex against one\u2019s will, and the emotional fallout from \u201cundercover relationships\u201d has rightly proved a scandal in recent years. Meanwhile, sexpionage films such as Mission: Impossible II fail to conceive their female characters as anything more than passive sex objects and Bond girls remain dazzling but disposable. The re-release this weekend of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Notorious, arguably the greatest sexpionage movie of them all, throws the subgenre into relief. In 1944, Hitchcock had an idea for the second film he would make with Ingrid Bergman, an actor with whom he was besotted.

      "body": "<p>We have become used to the endless avalanche of announcements of new shows by Netflix, but recently it\u2019s the deluge of cancellations that has stopped us in our tracks. Designated Survivor and Santa Clara Diet are gone. Tuca &amp; Bertie, despite receiving much acclaim, has also been given the chop.</p> <p>Now The OA has been added to the list. The OA! One of the most interesting and thought-provoking shows on television. It may never have felt destined for a mainstream audience, but ask anyone else who got into it like I did and they will tell you that the mystery sci-fi drama created by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij changed the game in what you thought was possible on television.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/16/netflix-the-oa-brit-marling-zal-batmanglij\">The OA: revealing the secrets of 2016's most mysterious TV show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Partly it was because of just how far the plot was willing to stretch itself. The premise, for those unfamiliar with the show, concerned a young woman, Prairie (Brit Marling), reappearing in her home town seven years after she disappeared. The first twist? She was now able to see having been blind before. The second? That she was adopted by her American midwest parents and was really from Moscow, the daughter of a Russian oligarch. Most shows would have been tempted to have unpeeled these details over the course of half a season. The OA did that in the first episode, which felt as if it was 15 minutes. And, what\u2019s more, those developments were almost bland compared with the twists that were to come.</p> <p>Yet, for all its desire to jolt viewers, The OA never once jumped the shark. Not even with a twist that involved a telepathic killer octopus. Then there was the cliffhanger of season two, not just one of the best cliffhangers of any show on Netflix, but probably of all time. It was so ridiculous, so dramatic, so bizarre, so meta, that at first you assumed they wrote it in a panic and went: \u201cScrew it.\u201d It was only after you shouted at the screen, or texted half your mates in ALL CAPS, that you realised that, heck, it actually worked. In fact, it set up a potentially wild third season, piling more possibilities on to what always felt like a limitless show. But now we won\u2019t have a conclusion. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"799379fe2a9713606a2d49daf6860d75852f961d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/799379fe2a9713606a2d49daf6860d75852f961d/0_217_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scene from The OA second series\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let me out \u2026 Now we\u2019ll never know what was going to happen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Goode/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This OA was more than just shocks and ludicrousness. It had real depth, on a level that was unexpectedly spiritual. With much of the plot dealing with themes of the afterlife and personal choice, it pushed viewers to think about the bigger questions: can we change the course of history? Are our lives meaningless or part of some divine plan? Adding to this philosophical strand were dream sequences, opening up a heaven so far removed from our own reality that you wondered, heck even hoped, that such a place could exist.</p> <p>Some might hope that another television network will pick up The OA, as NBC did when it rescued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/14/brooklyn-nine-nine-fan-power-cancelled-nbc-fox?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">Brooklyn-Nine-Nine</a>. But it is unclear where else the show would fit. What made it exceptional was how it was perfectly built for Netflix. Opening titles? Nah. Instead of once each episode, they showed them once in the 56th minute of the first and then not again for an entire season, perhaps recognising that some of us might binge the whole lot in one go.

      "bodyText": "We have become used to the endless avalanche of announcements of new shows by Netflix, but recently it\u2019s the deluge of cancellations that has stopped us in our tracks. Designated Survivor and Santa Clara Diet are gone. Tuca &amp; Bertie, despite receiving much acclaim, has also been given the chop. Now The OA has been added to the list. The OA! One of the most interesting and thought-provoking shows on television. It may never have felt destined for a mainstream audience, but ask anyone else who got into it like I did and they will tell you that the mystery sci-fi drama created by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij changed the game in what you thought was possible on television. Partly it was because of just how far the plot was willing to stretch itself. The premise, for those unfamiliar with the show, concerned a young woman, Prairie (Brit Marling), reappearing in her home town seven years after she disappeared. The first twist? She was now able to see having been blind before. The second? That she was adopted by her American midwest parents and was really from Moscow, the daughter of a Russian oligarch. Most shows would have been tempted to have unpeeled these details over the course of half a season. The OA did that in the first episode, which felt as if it was 15 minutes. And, what\u2019s more, those developments were almost bland compared with the twists that were to come. Yet, for all its desire to jolt viewers, The OA never once jumped the shark. Not even with a twist that involved a telepathic killer octopus. Then there was the cliffhanger of season two, not just one of the best cliffhangers of any show on Netflix, but probably of all time. It was so ridiculous, so dramatic, so bizarre, so meta, that at first you assumed they wrote it in a panic and went: \u201cScrew it.\u201d It was only after you shouted at the screen, or texted half your mates in ALL CAPS, that you realised that, heck, it actually worked. In fact, it set up a potentially wild third season, piling more possibilities on to what always felt like a limitless show. But now we won\u2019t have a conclusion. This OA was more than just shocks and ludicrousness. It had real depth, on a level that was unexpectedly spiritual. With much of the plot dealing with themes of the afterlife and personal choice, it pushed viewers to think about the bigger questions: can we change the course of history? Are our lives meaningless or part of some divine plan? Adding to this philosophical strand were dream sequences, opening up a heaven so far removed from our own reality that you wondered, heck even hoped, that such a place could exist. Some might hope that another television network will pick up The OA, as NBC did when it rescued Brooklyn-Nine-Nine. But it is unclear where else the show would fit. What made it exceptional was how it was perfectly built for Netflix. Opening titles? Nah. Instead of once each episode, they showed them once in the 56th minute of the first and then not again for an entire season, perhaps recognising that some of us might binge the whole lot in one go. A similarly unorthodox approach was taken to the episode lengths \u2013 the longest episode was 71 minutes, the shortest 43, the length fitting around the story being told rather than the other way round. Traditional television would stifle this sort of approach. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t appear The OA is going going to find any new home. In a statement released on Instagram, Marling expressed her disappointment that she and Batmanglij \u201ccannot finish this story\u201d. When I interviewed Jason Issacs, one of the show\u2019s stars, he praised the pair\u2019s vision: \u201cThese guys are artists,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted to make something that is rich and layered, and also they have got five seasons in their head and [season two] needs to fit this labyrinthine puzzle they have already laid out for themselves.\u201d While the appeal of The OA was how it often asked more questions than it answers, it is a shame that, with just two seasons having been made, we won\u2019t be able to crack that puzzle at all.",

It would read: \u201cI went to London fashion week and all I got was this lousy (unsustainable) T-shirt.\u201d A pale form of dissent, I know, but it would probably generate some Insta likes and at least be a way to echo my frustration that the four premier global fashion jamborees (London, New York, Paris and Milan) continue to celebrate a system of production and consumption that is spinning us ever closer to ecological Armageddon.</p> \n<p>I had better get a move on with my T-shirt before London fashion week (LFW) is cancelled. Because the environmental group Extinction Rebellion has seized the initiative, writing to the British Fashion Council (BFC), conveners of London fashion week, demanding it is scrapped in favour of \u201ca people\u2019s assembly of industry professionals and designers as a platform to declare a climate and ecological emergency\u201d. It is too early to speculate on what format this might take, but it is not a scenario brimming with immediate Frow (front row) appeal. That is to say, it is hard to imagine fashion influencers, the Insta-elite and bloggeratti, including Kylie Jenner et al, stampeding to take part in a town hall meeting on Arctic melt rates. But Extinction Rebellion is not likely to be fazed by such frivolous objections. It is deadly serious, on account of the deadly nature of runaway climate change.</p> \n<p>The fashion sector has been in Extinction Rebellion\u2019s sights for a while. In February 2019, at the last LFW, the group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/17/climate-protesters-take-action-to-disrupt-london-fashion-week\" title=\"\">formed a human blockade around venues</a> to highlight the excessive carbon footprint of the industry and to force the BFC to declare a climate emergency. Two prominent members, Sara Arnold \u2013 founder of the fashion rental company Higher Studios \u2013 and the fashion designer Clare Farrell are former industry insiders. Farrell was a mentor for one of LFW\u2019s outstanding designers in February, Bethany Williams. Williams\u2019s social-justice themed collection was shown on the runway shortly before she received the Queen\u2019s Award for British Design. Unfortunately, Farrell was not there to see it: she had been removed from the queue for the show by the police, who recognised her as a protester.</p> \n<p>But Extinction Rebellion\u2019s desire to up the ante is not motivated by revenge or spite. (Farrell was sanguine after the incident. \u201cOh well,\u201d she said, \u201cat least I don\u2019t have to go through the rigmarole of an FOI request to find out if I\u2019m on the domestic terrorism list.\u201d) This is not about payback. When you get your mandate from the planet (as Extinction Rebellion might claim), there is no escaping the fact that the fashion system as it stands is unsustainable.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5f6ed9be9bbdb4bcb5d55c240fcad0c33a02ca0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f6ed9be9bbdb4bcb5d55c240fcad0c33a02ca0/0_73_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sara Arnold, Tamsin Ormond and Emily Sheffield at the Port Eliot Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sara Arnold, Tamsin Ormond and Emily Sheffield at the Port Eliot Festival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While for decades it managed to swerve any implication that it was anything other than fabulous, increased scrutiny of its environmental impact has proved startling. An industry that depends on the growing of cotton \u2013 a pesticide-dependent and highly thirsty crop \u2013 and the cracking of oil for synthetic fibres, inevitably has a huge impact. Over the past decade, production has intensified. Globally, we now produce in excess of an estimated 100bn new garments a year, almost all from virgin resources. These garments stay in our lives for an increasingly short space of time, becoming waste (with yet more impact). Even the industry-friendly Pulse report conceded earlier this year that fashion is failing to counterbalance the harmful impact of an ever-swelling clothing inventory and continues to be a net contributor to climate change. By 2050, without radical action, the global textile industry will be accountable for one quarter of all carbon emissions. As Extinction Rebellion organisers recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jul/26/extinction-rebellion-fashion-week-should-be-a-declaration-of-emergency\" title=\"\">made clear in a talk at the Port Eliot festival</a>, the emissions alone give them a mandate for decisive action.

To remove a linchpin event that \u2013 according to the BFC \u2013 secures more that \u00a390m in global media coverage and generates more than \u00a3100m worth of orders of new clothes each year, would surely be a crazy move.</p> \n<p>But isn\u2019t that precisely the point?

For many years, LFW ran Estethica, a dedicated wing of the show profiling sustainable fashion (although it was often housed in a rather hard-to-get-to wing of Somerset House). But these designers and initiatives are the exception, not the norm. Elsewhere, the 60 catwalks over six days perpetuate business as usual.

      "bodyText": "The northern outskirts of Melbourne is hardly where you\u2019d expect to see one of the world\u2019s biggest stars of the screen. But when India\u2019s Shah Rukh Khan walked into the main hall of Melbourne\u2019s La Trobe University, more than an hour late of course, there was no doubt an icon had arrived. Known best by his initials, SRK, Khan is in Australia to launch Melbourne\u2019s Indian film festival. On Friday, he received an honorary doctorate from La Trobe. \u201cWe just grew up watching his movies,\u201d said fan Sudipta Datta after the event. \u201cHe\u2019s part of our childhood. To see him in person, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d No doubt it was the most raucous graduation here in years. During the official speeches, the La Trobe chancellor and former Victorian premier, John Brumby, quipped that there weren\u2019t usually so many people here to listen to him address graduation events. \u201cIt\u2019s Shah Rukh,\u201d came a voice from the audience, without a hint of irony. Later another interjection, one of many: \u201cMake love to me,\u201d said a man in the crowd. For a university courting the international student market, Khan\u2019s appearance is a coup of epic proportions. For Australia\u2019s Indian diaspora community, it was a chance to see a hero up close. A veteran of more than 80 films, Khan is sometimes called the King of Bollywood. Datta brought his mum. \u201cShe had the time of her life,\u201d he said. He was also there with Sumreen Kazi. As Khan tried to exit the venue \u2013 aided by dozens of guards \u2013 Kazi was among those who clamoured to touch the star of films such as My Name is Khan, Diwale, and Happy New Year. \u201cI\u2019ve got a video of him touching my hand,\u201d Kazi said, pointing to a video she had already posted to Snapchat. \u201cIt was chaos,\u201d Datta chimed in. \u201c[But] If this was in India, the security wouldn\u2019t be able to keep everyone together.\u201d As Khan exited, they were still forced to close the doors behind them, leaving a line of academic dignitaries in their robes locked in with the crowds. La Trobe said it had honoured Khan with the honorary degree for his work supporting women\u2019s empowerment and his achievement in the Indian entertainment industry. \u201cI am extremely, extremely touched and grateful for your graciousness and kindness,\u201d Khan told the crowd. Named after his father, Khan\u2019s Meer Foundation is best known for its work helping acid attack survivors, who are the victims of usually jealous or scorned men. He spoke about his philanthropic work, interrupted by cries from the audience after every few sentences. Born to a Muslim family and married to a Hindu, Khan has sparked controversy in the past for railing against nationalist sentiments. For a moment, he lamented: \u201cIn a world that is increasingly plagued by the sharing of negative sentiments \u2026 and a narrowing of humanity, more often than not societies are tending to reward anger and hatred, rather than nurture, compassion and love.\u201d In the media room before the formalities, organisers laid it on thick. Khan was introduced to a koala called Frankie, a joey called Jet, as well as a python and a kookaburra. Patting the koala, Khan quipped that he wished his son was here to meet him. The La Trobe organisers were excited when Khan posted about the trip to his 38 million Twitter followers. As Khan left and the crowd followed him out, some La Trobe students on campus wondered aloud what all the fuss was about. For Shoaib Khalid, a masters student, there was no question. \u201cIt\u2019s been my dream to meet him and finally La Trobe gave me my chance,\u201d he said. Well, almost. \u201cI was just sitting in the third row so you could say I was very close to him,\u201d said Khalid. \u201cAnd well, I\u2019m from Pakistan so \u2026 this was the closest thing I could ever have.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong>Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position:</strong> 10th (NB: this is not necessarily Jacob Steinberg\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips)</p> \n<p><strong>Last season\u2019s position:</strong> 10th</p> \n<p><strong>Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): </strong>500-1</p> \n<p>Lukasz Fabianski proved excellent value for money after joining West Ham for \u00a37m last summer. He was an ocean of calm behind his back four, barely put a foot wrong and even ended last season with numbers suggesting he was the Premier League\u2019s safest pair of hands.</p> \n<p>Only Neil Etheridge, relegated with Cardiff City, came close to matching Fabianski\u2019s 148 saves. Yet if Alisson made only 76 saves, it was because those in front of him ensured that Liverpool\u2019s brilliant Brazilian faced only 100 shots.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it is unfair to compare West Ham with the European champions. So let\u2019s look at teams who finished above them in the Premier League\u2019s mid-table mini-league. Everton\u2019s Jordan Pickford was worked 143 times. Rui Patr\u00edcio, outstanding for Wolves, was called into action 147 times. Leicester\u2019s Kasper Schmeichel faced 143 shots.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/westham-zip/giv-3902gc1QuBLcyZpp\" data-alt=\"Last five\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/westham-zip/giv-3902gc1QuBLcyZpp\">Last five</a> \n</figure> \n<p>By contrast Fabianski was tested 206 times and although the Pole\u2019s statistics were impressive, they were not enough to stop West Ham conceding 55 goals and finishing with a negative goal difference. Viewed in a harsh light, the figures begin to look like the reason why Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side fell short of seventh place.</p> \n<p>With that in mind it might have made sense for Pellegrini to focus on improving his side\u2019s defending this summer. West Ham have lacked a commanding central midfielder for years and it was an encouraging sign when they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/03/west-ham-renewed-20-million-bid-andre-gomes-barcelona-transfer-window-football\">attempted to sign Barcelona\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Gomes</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet Gomes chose Everton and West Ham\u2019s next move was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/12/west-ham-close-signing-villarreal-pablo-fornals-24m\">paying \u00a324m for Villarreal\u2019s Pablo Fornals</a>, another creator to slot in alongside Felipe Anderson, Manuel Lanzini and Jack Wilshere, and the search for a screening player was put on hold. Fornals, who helped Spain win the Under-21 European Championship this summer, is more likely to frustrate opponents with piercing through-balls than perceptive interceptions.</p> \n<p>The messaging changed. After a transitional first year it was said that Pellegrini plans to lift West Ham closer to the top six by playing on the front foot, with the manager following the arrival of Fornals by spending most of his remaining funds on a new striker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2019/jul/18/sebastien-haller-west-ham-good-business-transfer\">Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Sebastien Haller</a>.</p> \n<p>It means West Ham remain difficult to read. There has been undoubted improvement under Pellegrini, who has the backing of the board, but the Chilean struggled to stamp out his side\u2019s inconsistency. They mostly toiled against mid-table opponents, while humblings on the road against Burnley, Brighton and Cardiff exposed an inability to cope with physicality.</p> \n<p>However Pellegrini\u2019s approach often worked against the top sides. Although the former Real Madrid manager\u2019s expansiveness backfired when Manchester City ran riot at the London Stadium and Chelsea punished his 4-4-2 system at Stamford Bridge, there were deserved wins over Arsenal and Manchester United, a worthy 1-1 home draw with Liverpool and an intelligent performance which made West Ham the first visiting team to win at Tottenham\u2019s new ground.</p> \n<p>Those performances raised optimism and there was much to admire about the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/04/west-ham-to-sell-marko-arnautovic-25m-euros-china\">Pellegrini got rid of Marko Arnautovic</a> last month, even though West Ham were disappointed that Shanghai SIPG paid only \u00a322.4m for the disruptive Austrian.</p> \n<p>Selling Arnautovic left West Ham under pressure to sign a striker. They had already shifted Andy Carroll and Lucas P\u00e9rez off the wage bill, leaving Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Jordan Hugill as their only senior forwards, and there was mild panic when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/09/west-ham-lose-out-valencia-maxi-gomez-celta-vigo\">Valencia beat them to the signing of Maxi G\u00f3mez</a> from Celta Vigo.</p> \n<p>Unlike in previous years, however, West Ham reacted decisively. Pellegrini and Mario Husillos, the director of football, pressed for Haller and David Sullivan, the powerful co-owner, agreed to break West Ham\u2019s transfer record for a player whose fee could rise to \u20ac50m.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/westham-zip/giv-3902X7PlSD2mfIWv\" data-alt=\"WDL\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/westham-zip/giv-3902X7PlSD2mfIWv\">WDL</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Haller is regarded as the complete striker because of his ability to score goals, create them and bring teammates into play. The 25-year-old is also bound to work harder than Arnautovic \u2013 no Bundesliga striker made more tackles per 90 minutes last season.</p> \n<p>West Ham can sense a team slowly coming together. With Anderson, Fornals and Lanzini operating as a trio behind Haller, there could be plenty of fun \u2013 and plenty of frustration. Anderson, the gifted Brazilian winger, needs to push on after scoring 10 goals following his arrival from Lazio last summer and can be lazy when it comes to protecting his left-back. Fornals will need time to settle. It remains to be seen whether Lanzini will be the same after a serious knee injury.</p> \n<p>Pellegrini will also have to be patient with Andriy Yarmolenko as the Ukrainian winger continues his comeback from an achilles injury and there is concern about what would happen if Haller were sidelined. Hern\u00e1ndez is not robust enough and although the versatile Michail Antonio finished last season well, he can lack the nous to play up front. However the arrival of Albian Ajeti on deadline day should lighten Haller\u2019s load. The 22-year-old Swiss striker scored 15 goals for FC Basel last season.</p> \n<p>Yet there could be pressure on West Ham\u2019s attack to flourish. In central midfield Declan Rice will look to protect the back four and ensure he keeps his England spot before Euro 2020. But while Robert Snodgrass never lets anyone down and Mark Noble remains a solid performer, it is surprising that West Ham are yet to find an upgrade on the latter. There is a lack of pace in the middle and gambling on Wilshere staying fit feels unwise, especially as an injury to the former Arsenal midfielder would push Carlos S\u00e1nchez closer to a starting spot following the sale of Pedro Obiang to Sassuolo.</p> \n<p>Yet while Obiang\u2019s exit has freed up space in the budget for incomings, with the departures of Edimilson Fernandes, Sam Byram, Adrian, Reece Oxford, Hugill and Samir Nasri also helping Pellegrini prune his squad, the concern is that it will still be too easy to get at West Ham\u2019s back four.</p> \n<p>That said Pellegrini has immense confidence in Fabian Balbuena and Issa Diop as a partnership in central defence.

      "bodyText": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position: 10th (NB: this is not necessarily Jacob Steinberg\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: 10th Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 500-1 Lukasz Fabianski proved excellent value for money after joining West Ham for \u00a37m last summer. He was an ocean of calm behind his back four, barely put a foot wrong and even ended last season with numbers suggesting he was the Premier League\u2019s safest pair of hands. Only Neil Etheridge, relegated with Cardiff City, came close to matching Fabianski\u2019s 148 saves. Yet if Alisson made only 76 saves, it was because those in front of him ensured that Liverpool\u2019s brilliant Brazilian faced only 100 shots. Perhaps it is unfair to compare West Ham with the European champions. So let\u2019s look at teams who finished above them in the Premier League\u2019s mid-table mini-league. Everton\u2019s Jordan Pickford was worked 143 times. Rui Patr\u00edcio, outstanding for Wolves, was called into action 147 times. Leicester\u2019s Kasper Schmeichel faced 143 shots. By contrast Fabianski was tested 206 times and although the Pole\u2019s statistics were impressive, they were not enough to stop West Ham conceding 55 goals and finishing with a negative goal difference. Viewed in a harsh light, the figures begin to look like the reason why Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side fell short of seventh place. With that in mind it might have made sense for Pellegrini to focus on improving his side\u2019s defending this summer. West Ham have lacked a commanding central midfielder for years and it was an encouraging sign when they attempted to sign Barcelona\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Gomes. Yet Gomes chose Everton and West Ham\u2019s next move was paying \u00a324m for Villarreal\u2019s Pablo Fornals, another creator to slot in alongside Felipe Anderson, Manuel Lanzini and Jack Wilshere, and the search for a screening player was put on hold. Fornals, who helped Spain win the Under-21 European Championship this summer, is more likely to frustrate opponents with piercing through-balls than perceptive interceptions. The messaging changed. After a transitional first year it was said that Pellegrini plans to lift West Ham closer to the top six by playing on the front foot, with the manager following the arrival of Fornals by spending most of his remaining funds on a new striker, Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Sebastien Haller. It means West Ham remain difficult to read. There has been undoubted improvement under Pellegrini, who has the backing of the board, but the Chilean struggled to stamp out his side\u2019s inconsistency. They mostly toiled against mid-table opponents, while humblings on the road against Burnley, Brighton and Cardiff exposed an inability to cope with physicality. However Pellegrini\u2019s approach often worked against the top sides. Although the former Real Madrid manager\u2019s expansiveness backfired when Manchester City ran riot at the London Stadium and Chelsea punished his 4-4-2 system at Stamford Bridge, there were deserved wins over Arsenal and Manchester United, a worthy 1-1 home draw with Liverpool and an intelligent performance which made West Ham the first visiting team to win at Tottenham\u2019s new ground. Those performances raised optimism and there was much to admire about the way Pellegrini got rid of Marko Arnautovic last month, even though West Ham were disappointed that Shanghai SIPG paid only \u00a322.4m for the disruptive Austrian. Selling Arnautovic left West Ham under pressure to sign a striker. They had already shifted Andy Carroll and Lucas P\u00e9rez off the wage bill, leaving Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Jordan Hugill as their only senior forwards, and there was mild panic when Valencia beat them to the signing of Maxi G\u00f3mez from Celta Vigo. Unlike in previous years, however, West Ham reacted decisively. Pellegrini and Mario Husillos, the director of football, pressed for Haller and David Sullivan, the powerful co-owner, agreed to break West Ham\u2019s transfer record for a player whose fee could rise to \u20ac50m. Haller is regarded as the complete striker because of his ability to score goals, create them and bring teammates into play. The 25-year-old is also bound to work harder than Arnautovic \u2013 no Bundesliga striker made more tackles per 90 minutes last season. West Ham can sense a team slowly coming together. With Anderson, Fornals and Lanzini operating as a trio behind Haller, there could be plenty of fun \u2013 and plenty of frustration. Anderson, the gifted Brazilian winger, needs to push on after scoring 10 goals following his arrival from Lazio last summer and can be lazy when it comes to protecting his left-back. Fornals will need time to settle. It remains to be seen whether Lanzini will be the same after a serious knee injury. Pellegrini will also have to be patient with Andriy Yarmolenko as the Ukrainian winger continues his comeback from an achilles injury and there is concern about what would happen if Haller were sidelined. Hern\u00e1ndez is not robust enough and although the versatile Michail Antonio finished last season well, he can lack the nous to play up front. However the arrival of Albian Ajeti on deadline day should lighten Haller\u2019s load. The 22-year-old Swiss striker scored 15 goals for FC Basel last season. Yet there could be pressure on West Ham\u2019s attack to flourish. In central midfield Declan Rice will look to protect the back four and ensure he keeps his England spot before Euro 2020. But while Robert Snodgrass never lets anyone down and Mark Noble remains a solid performer, it is surprising that West Ham are yet to find an upgrade on the latter. There is a lack of pace in the middle and gambling on Wilshere staying fit feels unwise, especially as an injury to the former Arsenal midfielder would push Carlos S\u00e1nchez closer to a starting spot following the sale of Pedro Obiang to Sassuolo. Yet while Obiang\u2019s exit has freed up space in the budget for incomings, with the departures of Edimilson Fernandes, Sam Byram, Adrian, Reece Oxford, Hugill and Samir Nasri also helping Pellegrini prune his squad, the concern is that it will still be too easy to get at West Ham\u2019s back four. That said Pellegrini has immense confidence in Fabian Balbuena and Issa Diop as a partnership in central defence. But he needs them to stay fit. Angelo Ogbonna has become a rickety presence, Winston Reid has not played since March 2018 because of a knee problem and West Ham were leaky during pre-season, conceding 12 goals in five games. Last weekend\u2019s 2-2 draw with Athletic Bilbao convinced Pellegrini to dip into the market for another centre-back, with the promising 19-year-old Goncalo Cardoso expected to challenge Balbuena and Diop after his \u00a33m move from Boavista. The full-backs also need to convince Pellegrini of their worth. Ryan Fredericks must work on the defensive side of his game if he is to keep Pablo Zabaleta and Ben Johnson out at right-back, while Aaron Cresswell and Arthur Masuaku are both much of a muchness at left-back. Unless those flaws are eradicated it is difficult to see West Ham getting close to the top six. Yet there as many strengths as weaknesses and they have not had a better manager than Pellegrini in the Premier League era. Finishing as best of the rest should not be beyond them.",

Resident artists include pianists Barry Douglas and Finghin Collins, violinist Elina V\u00e4h\u00e4la, viola player Nobuko Imai and cellist Andr\u00e9s D\u00edaz, and the opening concert sets the tone with Schubert, Brahms and Faur\u00e9.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.goh.co.uk/whats-on/clandeboye-festival-a-sense-of-place-and-landscape/\">Clandeboye Estate, Bangor, Friday 16 to 24 August</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbcd51547cf8f80a7d9c6d1c17e11f089253b129\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbcd51547cf8f80a7d9c6d1c17e11f089253b129/0_158_1651_991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winifred Nicholson\u2019s Sound of Rhum, from Bay of Laig, Isla of Eigg (The Singing Sands).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winifred Nicholson\u2019s Sound of Rhum, from Bay of Laig, Isla of Eigg (The Singing Sands).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estate of Winifred Nicholson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Beyond Landscape</h2> <p>The Pier Arts Centre is one of Britain\u2019s most picturesque galleries as well one of the northernmost, literally balanced on a pier in Stromness harbour. That makes it a perfect venue for this exhibition examining landscape artists such as Winifred Nicholson who venture into the abstract and question reality itself. Sublime art in a sublime setting.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.pierartscentre.com/current-upcoming-exhibition/6/4/2019/beyond-landscape\">The Pier Arts Centre, Stromness, Orkney, to 9 November</a></em></p> <h2>Seaside: Photographed</h2> <p>If you\u2019re heading for the seaside, why not take in this pictorial history of a British institution? Sea bathing started in the 18th century and was popularised in Victorian times. This exhibition starts with 1850s beach photographers and explores the salty tang of seaside fun in pictures by Martin Parr, Jane Bown, Chloe Dewe Mathews and more.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/exhibitions/seaside-photographed\">Turner Contemporary, Margate, to 8 September</a></em></p> <h2>Cut and Paste</h2> <p>This hugely enjoyable exhibition claims that collage was not invented by Picasso and Braque in their cubist art in 1912, but was already a popular medium in Victorian times. Surrealist Max Ernst was obsessed with cutting up 19th-century magazines to create dream images with a Victorian feel, and that nostalgia persists in the pop collages of Peter Blake and the fantasies of Terry Gilliam.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/cut-and-paste-400-years-collage\">Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art Two, Edinburgh, to 27 October</a></em></p> <h2>Natalia Goncharova</h2> <p>The artist who designed the Ballets Russes production of Stravinsky\u2019s The Firebird emerges here as a magic realist painter of Russia\u2019s peasant society, customs and beliefs. Her rollicking cubistic homages to Russia\u2019s predominantly rural people portray a past that was effaced by the 1917 Revolution. Goncharova was famous as a futurist but there is much more sadness than optimism in her city scenes, while the primitive power of Orthodox icons thrills her.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/natalia-goncharova?gclid=CjwKCAjw7anqBRALEiwAgvGgm1UYXAvhCVoCgNVzeEfl4h12mfbBO2fgoEwHQ2-qmULj1CI2svfMMhoCPZIQAvD_BwE\">Tate Modern, SE1, to 8 September</a></em></p> <h2>Secret Rivers</h2> <p>Under the capital flows a hidden network of buried rivers with names that sound like charms in stories of the city: Effra, Fleet, Neckinger, Lea, Wandle, Tyburn, Walbrook \u2026 and the less romantic-sounding Westbourne.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood (18) (Quentin Tarantino, 2019, UK/US/Chi) 161 mins Is Quentin Tarantino the last Hollywood auteur? Or is he a nostalgia-fetishising relic of the pre-#MeToo Tinseltown? However you feel, this latest \u2013 about a washed-up TV star and his stuntman pal in an LA soon to see the grisly Manson murders \u2013 is a high-powered, affecting offering, with heavyweight performers bringing their A game. Out on Wednesday. Blinded By the Light (12A) (Gurinder Chadha, 2019, UK) 117 mins Sometime Guardian journalist Sarfraz Manzoor\u2019s memoir \u2013 about growing up in Luton the son of a Pakistani immigrant factory worker and becoming obsessed with Bruce Springsteen \u2013 has been turned into a crowdpleasing film by Bend It Like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha. Animals (15) (Sophie Hyde, 2019, UK) 109 mins This Dublin-set adaptation of Emma Jane Unsworth\u2019s novel about two twentysomething women\u2019s hedonistic lifestyle has become a flagwaver for empowered post-Fleabag cinema, with Holliday Grainger and Alia Shawkat as the BFFs whose friendship is turned around when one of them gets sidetracked into a serious relationship with a man. Marianne &amp; Leonard: Words of Love (12A) (Nick Broomfield, 2019, UK) 102 mins Kurt and Courtney director Nick Broomfield outlines another celebrated music industry relationship: that of Leonard Cohen and Marianne Ihlen, the woman who inspired his songs So Long Marianne and Bird on a Wire. In truth, it\u2019s not an especially dramatic story, but it\u2019s capped by Cohen\u2019s wonderful deathbed letter, and Broomfield\u2019s surprising revelations of his proximity to it all. Apocalypse Now: Final Cut (15) (Francis Ford Coppola, 1979, US) 183 mins After the redux version, now the last ever (promise?). Coppola has trimmed 20 minutes from the extra-long version of his madness-of-war epic that he put out in 2001; that one had added nearly an hour of deleted material to his 1979 original. The director has said this new version is \u201cjust right\u201d, although it still contains the divisive \u201cFrench plantation\u201d scene. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Sophie If you were quick you might have snapped up the limited-edition remix version of professional noise merchant Sophie\u2019s debut album Oil of Every Pearl\u2019s Un-Insides, which came housed inside a clutch bag. No, seriously. The price? A snip at just $285. For everyone else, here is an opportunity to hear that album, and many more of her synapse-snapping sonic experiments, at a one-off show as part of Nile Rodgers\u2019s Meltdown series. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Saturday 10 August We Out Here festival The brainchild of DJ and label owner Gilles Peterson, the inaugural We Out Here festival promises to join the dots between soul, hip-hop, electronica and jazz. As well as a host of DJs with immaculate record collections, it also boasts a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of genre-agnostic live acts, from the lo-fi R&amp;B vignettes of Tirzah to rapper/spoken word artist Kojey Radical\u2019s epic communions. Mill Hill Field, Huntingdon, Thursday 15 to 18 August Liz Lawrence After years of being part of someone else\u2019s story \u2013 be it as one half of electro duo Cash+David or touring with Bombay Bicycle Club \u2013 DIY indie pop experimentalist Liz Lawrence is stepping out on her own. The title of her new album, Pity Party, sums up her creative dichotomy; for example, jaunty, loved-up single Navigator opens with a lyric about being covered in blood. The Social, W1, Tuesday 13 August The Cure The Cure\u2019s Sunday Glastonbury slot was so long it has probably only just finished \u2013 which is perfect timing, really, as they\u2019re also booked to play in Glasgow as part of the Summer Sessions series (your dad\u2019s faves the Foo Fighters headline on 17 Aug while your younger sister\u2019s faves the 1975 play a week later). Robert Smith et al will be joined by fellow miserabilists Mogwai and the Twilight Sad. Bellahouston Park, Glasgow, Friday 16 August MC Brad Shepik Trio One of the most intriguing contemporary guitarists is the American original Brad Shepik, once a protege of cross-genre guitarist Ralph Towner. Shepik has worked in Dave Douglas\u2019s Balkan-leaning Tiny Bell Trio, with the late drummer Paul Motian, and with musicians from many cultures. This is a rare UK chance to catch him. Nottingham, Saturday 10 August; Manchester, Monday 12 August JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Pictured Within: Birthday Variations for MCB On his 60th birthday, Martyn Brabbins will be conducting a Prom with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra that includes Vaughan Williams\u2019s Serenade to Music, Brahms\u2019s Song of Destiny and Elgar\u2019s Enigma Variations. But no Brabbins concert would be complete without new music, and here it is a work commissioned by the BBC to mark his big day. Pictured Within is an Enigma-inspired collective piece from 14 composers: an international lineup ranging from Kalevi Aho to Judith Weir. However successful, it certainly won\u2019t lack variety. Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Tuesday 13 August Eugene Onegin Four years ago, the Komische Oper Berlin brought Barrie Kosky\u2019s inventive production of Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute to Edinburgh. The company is returning this year with his restrained version of Tchaikovsky\u2019s masterpiece, first seen in 2016. Then it featured the soprano Asmik Grigorian as Tatyana, and she returns to the role on Thursday and Saturday, with G\u00fcnter Papendell as Onegin. Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, Thursday 15 to 17 August Clandeboye festival Although Camerata Ireland appear at the end of the programme, the focus of the Clandeboye festival is very much on chamber music.

      "body": "<p>In May, many thousands of eider ducks arrive in Iceland. They nest on the ground close to cottages, or on windowsills, roofs, old vehicles, tyres and outhouses. The beautiful sea ducks, with long slanting bills, stay close to people because the farmers protect them from predators. Females tug strands of down from their breasts to warm their eggs and ducklings. Only when the young have been led to the water do the farmers collect this famous down, which mostly goes into expensive duvets, pillows and clothing in Europe and Japan. Not much stays in Iceland.</p> <p>Edward Posnett became fascinated by the relationship between Icelandic farmers and eiders when he was working in London\u2019s Canary Wharf, investigating financial irregularities in the commodity markets. On his screen every day was a vast teeming process of exchange. Goods of all kinds were reduced to figures in complex transactions. Posnett wondered about the realities behind these flickering numbers \u2013 the skills, the emotions and physical experiences. He was alienated by the size and reach of the markets. The system\u2019s sheer distance from people and natural environments seemed a likely cause of poverty and degradation. In the eiders he saw an alternative, an evolved form of co-operation between human beings and a non-human species, beneficial to both, chosen by both, yet able to thrive amid large economic and ecological forces.</p> <p>Was this really true? And where else could such practices be found? Posnett set out to look for them. He compares his search to Victorian quest romances, and in our times such relationships are truly a prize worth seeking. His quest is for several qualities \u2013 and inevitably no case meets all his aspirations. The harvest has to sustain both communities. Creatures providing goods must flourish, and others that share the environment must not suffer (unlike the arctic foxes that prey on the eiders, who are shot by farmers). Rewards should be widely distributed. Methods of husbandry have to arise from, and renew, an intimate understanding of the natural environment and its creatures.

      "bodyText": "In May, many thousands of eider ducks arrive in Iceland. They nest on the ground close to cottages, or on windowsills, roofs, old vehicles, tyres and outhouses. The beautiful sea ducks, with long slanting bills, stay close to people because the farmers protect them from predators. Females tug strands of down from their breasts to warm their eggs and ducklings. Only when the young have been led to the water do the farmers collect this famous down, which mostly goes into expensive duvets, pillows and clothing in Europe and Japan. Not much stays in Iceland. Edward Posnett became fascinated by the relationship between Icelandic farmers and eiders when he was working in London\u2019s Canary Wharf, investigating financial irregularities in the commodity markets. On his screen every day was a vast teeming process of exchange. Goods of all kinds were reduced to figures in complex transactions. Posnett wondered about the realities behind these flickering numbers \u2013 the skills, the emotions and physical experiences. He was alienated by the size and reach of the markets. The system\u2019s sheer distance from people and natural environments seemed a likely cause of poverty and degradation. In the eiders he saw an alternative, an evolved form of co-operation between human beings and a non-human species, beneficial to both, chosen by both, yet able to thrive amid large economic and ecological forces. Was this really true? And where else could such practices be found? Posnett set out to look for them. He compares his search to Victorian quest romances, and in our times such relationships are truly a prize worth seeking. His quest is for several qualities \u2013 and inevitably no case meets all his aspirations. The harvest has to sustain both communities. Creatures providing goods must flourish, and others that share the environment must not suffer (unlike the arctic foxes that prey on the eiders, who are shot by farmers). Rewards should be widely distributed. Methods of husbandry have to arise from, and renew, an intimate understanding of the natural environment and its creatures. They will then be less vulnerable to obsolescence. Such co-evolved skills are a practical way of loving and living in a place, and will be encoded in culture and myth. Yet the methods must also be adaptable to new technologies and global markets, if, as Posnett hopes, they are to become a model for reform of industry in response to ecological crisis.

In a video that was posted to YouTube in 2013, Biles did the same dismount series she showed during podium training on Wednesday onto a soft landing surface. Not long after asked Aimee Boorman, her former coach, about this and other skills I had seen her mess around with and she characterized them as play, as a way of breaking up the monotony of training. In the run-up to Rio, Biles wasn\u2019t making significant upgrades to her routine. The plan back then was to hold steady, keep Biles injury-free and get her through the unfathomable pressure she was about to face at her first Games.</p> \n<p>But Biles is not playing around anymore. Now that she\u2019s won everything there is to win \u2013 and many of those things more than once \u2013 Biles is pushing the technical boundaries of the sport and amazing herself in the process.</p> \n<p><em>Amazement</em> is how Biles characterized her reaction to her own abilities and performance after last month\u2019s US Classic, which she, of course, won. Afterward she was asked in the post-meet interview by NBC\u2019s Tim Daggett how much better she could actually get. Biles didn\u2019t give the quantitative answer that the question demanded, a unit of measurement for \u201cbetter\u201d; rather, she offered us a glimpse into her mindset, which is that of a supremely confident female athlete. \u201cI feel like every day in training I amaze myself even more so we\u2019ll have to see what\u2019s to come,\u201d she said of the new, staggeringly difficult skills she performs with seeming ease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cd1b9496-d00f-4362-be02-28767781bba2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JsjgDIlX2y0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Every day in practice is a little revelation for Biles. She\u2019s discovering just how good she is and, most importantly, she\u2019s telling us. There\u2019s no hiding behind an \u201cI just hope to do my best\u201d persona. When I interviewed her back in early 2016, she would <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/dvorameyers/simone-biles-mental-gymnastics\">say things like</a>, \u201cIf I make the Olympic team\u201d even though her inclusion on the team was never in doubt if she remained healthy. I don\u2019t think her statements were disingenuous; I just don\u2019t think she was ready to fully own just how good she is.</p> \n<p>The increased confidence has lead to an outspokenness and, at times, a willingness to be vulnerable. Biles, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/15/simone-biles-larry-nassar-sexual-abuse-allegations-usa-gymnastics\">came forward last year</a> as a survivor of sexual abuse by Larry Nassar, has openly criticized USA Gymnastics for their failures in protecting and caring for the athletes. Her tweets have led to the closing of the Karolyi Ranch, the place where many of the gymnasts were abused, and played a role in the resignation of very short-lived USA Gymnastics president Mary Bono.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/08/simone-biles-usa-gymnastics-larry-nassar-abuse\">Addressing the media</a> after the training session was over, Biles, her voice breaking, spoke about how hard it is for her to come to Kansas City to compete for an organization that had failed her and so many others. Last week, a new Congressional report was released that charged that multiple institutions, including the USA Gymnastics, Michigan State, the US Olympic Committee, and the FBI had opportunities to stop Nassar and did not.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything that they\u2019ve asked us for, even when we didn\u2019t want to and they couldn\u2019t do one damn job,\u201d she said. \u201cYou had one job. You literally had one job and you couldn\u2019t protect us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biles is often spoken about in superhero terms, with the focus on her tremendous athletic ability, and doesn\u2019t get nearly enough credit for her mental discipline. To be able to perform incredible athletic feats is one thing; to be able to do them under pressure, year after year, and hit as consistently as she has, is as impressive a feat as the double double she showcased off the beam. To do it all while grappling with the trauma of sexual abuse, and competing for the very same federation that enabled your abuse, is another level of difficulty entirely \u2013 one the judges can\u2019t factor into your difficulty score. It is, to borrow from her own words, simply amazing.</p>",

In a video that was posted to YouTube in 2013, Biles did the same dismount series she showed during podium training on Wednesday onto a soft landing surface. Not long after asked Aimee Boorman, her former coach, about this and other skills I had seen her mess around with and she characterized them as play, as a way of breaking up the monotony of training. In the run-up to Rio, Biles wasn\u2019t making significant upgrades to her routine. The plan back then was to hold steady, keep Biles injury-free and get her through the unfathomable pressure she was about to face at her first Games. But Biles is not playing around anymore. Now that she\u2019s won everything there is to win \u2013 and many of those things more than once \u2013 Biles is pushing the technical boundaries of the sport and amazing herself in the process. Amazement is how Biles characterized her reaction to her own abilities and performance after last month\u2019s US Classic, which she, of course, won. Afterward she was asked in the post-meet interview by NBC\u2019s Tim Daggett how much better she could actually get. Biles didn\u2019t give the quantitative answer that the question demanded, a unit of measurement for \u201cbetter\u201d; rather, she offered us a glimpse into her mindset, which is that of a supremely confident female athlete. \u201cI feel like every day in training I amaze myself even more so we\u2019ll have to see what\u2019s to come,\u201d she said of the new, staggeringly difficult skills she performs with seeming ease. Every day in practice is a little revelation for Biles. She\u2019s discovering just how good she is and, most importantly, she\u2019s telling us. There\u2019s no hiding behind an \u201cI just hope to do my best\u201d persona. When I interviewed her back in early 2016, she would say things like, \u201cIf I make the Olympic team\u201d even though her inclusion on the team was never in doubt if she remained healthy. I don\u2019t think her statements were disingenuous; I just don\u2019t think she was ready to fully own just how good she is. The increased confidence has lead to an outspokenness and, at times, a willingness to be vulnerable. Biles, who came forward last year as a survivor of sexual abuse by Larry Nassar, has openly criticized USA Gymnastics for their failures in protecting and caring for the athletes. Her tweets have led to the closing of the Karolyi Ranch, the place where many of the gymnasts were abused, and played a role in the resignation of very short-lived USA Gymnastics president Mary Bono. Addressing the media after the training session was over, Biles, her voice breaking, spoke about how hard it is for her to come to Kansas City to compete for an organization that had failed her and so many others. Last week, a new Congressional report was released that charged that multiple institutions, including the USA Gymnastics, Michigan State, the US Olympic Committee, and the FBI had opportunities to stop Nassar and did not. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything that they\u2019ve asked us for, even when we didn\u2019t want to and they couldn\u2019t do one damn job,\u201d she said. \u201cYou had one job. You literally had one job and you couldn\u2019t protect us.\u201d Biles is often spoken about in superhero terms, with the focus on her tremendous athletic ability, and doesn\u2019t get nearly enough credit for her mental discipline. To be able to perform incredible athletic feats is one thing; to be able to do them under pressure, year after year, and hit as consistently as she has, is as impressive a feat as the double double she showcased off the beam. To do it all while grappling with the trauma of sexual abuse, and competing for the very same federation that enabled your abuse, is another level of difficulty entirely \u2013 one the judges can\u2019t factor into your difficulty score. It is, to borrow from her own words, simply amazing.",

The prizes were announced at an outdoor event in Darwin on the grounds of the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. This year is the 36th Natsiaa, which awards $50,000 to the overall winner and $5,000 to the winner of each of the six artwork categories.

We wait for the day our nation comes to terms with what it means to be Australians. Your art shows us a way.\u201d Natsiaa judge and director of the Art Gallery of South Australia, Rhana Devenport, said Marawili\u2019s work had \u201csuch power\u201d and spoke \u201cgenerationally, philosophically and internationally\u201d. \u201cAnd such resilience, and such innovation, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing here in this exhibition,\u201d she said. \u201cAn incredible flowering of innovation, of imagination, and of storytelling.\u201d Titus Nganjmirra from Gunbalanya in Western Arnhem, won the emerging artist award for his portrait of the Queen as she appears on banknotes, juxtaposed with the first flag to be planted on Australian country (near Sydney) and cultural images of the first people, the Nayuhyungki stone country beings. In the Kunwinjku language the word for both money and stone is \u201ckunwardde\u201d. Gunbalanya is one of Arnhem Land\u2019s more accessible communities and the local people run tourism ventures, including rock art tours. \u201cIn Arnhem Land people come and we share stories, stories from showing them art on French paper or even a bark from a eucalyptus tree which we go and get in February. Sometimes we take people and show them rock art and share the story with them. When we come down from the hill we leave the stories on top. It\u2019s just a relationship with Indigenous and non-Indigenous, we can all learn together,\u201d Nganjmirra said. \u201cA painting like this is important because [the painting around the Queen] it\u2019s been there a long time for us.\u201d Nganjmirra said he had to get approval from elders to draw his grandfather\u2019s or grandmother\u2019s country, but it was \u201cmy choice to show her majesty\u201d. Malaluba Gumana, a Dhalwang woman from the Gangan outstation in north-east Arnhem Land, won the Wandjuk Marika 3D award for a dominating trio of poles painted with Gumana\u2019s renowned \u201cmarwat\u201d or crosshatching, using a brush of fine human hair. \u201cIt\u2019s a Galpu painting, my mother\u2019s clan \u2026 I teach my granddaughters how to help me get the [colour], we get the stone,\u201d she said. \u201cI drive three hours to the art centre [from Gangan] and sell my paintings \u2026 I can do the shopping then go back and do another one.\u201d It is her second win \u2013 she won the best bark painting in 2013. Kaylene Whiskey, from Indulkana in South Australia, won the general painting award for her irreverent depiction of the Seven Sisters dreaming story/tjukurpa, through seven strong women: Wonder Woman, Cher, Whoopi Goldberg, the Wizard of Oz\u2019s Dorothy, Catwoman, Dolly Parton and Tina Turner. \u201cThey\u2019re hanging out on the Iwantja Arts sign, hiding from the cheeky wait [man],\u201d Whiskey said. Gutinjarra Yunupingu, a hearing-impaired artist from Yirrkala in north-east Arnhem Land, won the multimedia award for his video work telling his story of communicating his cultural identity and connection through Yolngu sign language, something all Yolngu children where Yunupingu lives are taught from a young age. Also from Yirrkala, Nonggirrnga Marawili won the best bark painting for her work showing the ancestral lightning strike \u2013 an electrical curse \u2013 on the Madarrpa clan estate of Baratjula. A senior woman working from the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka arts centre, Marawili has introduced unexpected colours into her traditional work by recycling the \u201cfound material\u201d of magenta printer toner. The winner of the general works on paper award, Mr Gardiner, died last year and was represented by his daughter, Sheila Gardiner. \u201cWhen I first walked in the gallery and saw the art it was very strong,\u201d said judge and Tiwi artist and cultural leader Pedro Wonaeamirri. The chief executive of the Natsiaa\u2019s major sponsor Telstra, Andrew Penn, said the exhibition showed the most important contemporary Indigenous art in Australia today and that there was an \u201curgent need to amplify Indigenous voices\u201d. \u201cIt is critical that we continue to celebrate and preserve the diversity of Indigenous culture by supporting new, emerging talent and leading artists from across the country,\u201d he said.",

But tying down Callum Wilson to a four-year contract was arguably Bournemouth\u2019s best piece of business, with Nathan Ake and Ryan Fraser also sticking around. Injuries to David Brooks, Lloyd Kelly and Dan Gosling have dampened enthusiasm but they look ready to build on last season\u2019s 14th place. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Philip Billing </strong>Huddersfield, \u00a315m; <strong>Lloyd Kelly </strong>Bristol City, \u00a313m;<strong> Arnaut Danjuma </strong>Club Brugge, \u00a313m; <strong>Jack Stacey</strong> Luton, \u00a34m; <strong>Harry Wilson</strong> Liverpool, loan.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Tyrone Mings </strong>Aston Villa, \u00a326.5m; <strong>Lys Mousset </strong>Sheffield United, \u00a310m;<strong> Harry Arter </strong>Fulham, loan.</p> <h2>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</h2> <p>Graham Potter\u2019s task at Brighton has been considerably eased by a flurry of signings across the past week. The arrival of Neal Maupay, Aaron Mooy and Adam Webster from Brentford, Huddersfield and Bristol City respectively, strengthens the spine of a team who had gone stale under Chris Hughton. Coupled with Leandro Trossard, who has shown glimpses of class in pre-season, Potter has plenty of ammunition, including Alireza Jahanbakhsh and J\u00fcrgen Locadia, who have so far underwhelmed on the south coast. <strong>BF</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Neal Maupay </strong>Brentford, \u00a320m; <strong>Adam Webster </strong>Bristol City, \u00a320m;<strong> Leandro Trossard </strong>Genk, \u00a315m; <strong>Matt Clarke </strong>Portsmouth, \u00a35m; <strong>Taylor Richards</strong> Manchester City, \u00a32.5m; <strong>Romaric Yapi</strong> Paris St-Germain, undisclosed; <strong>Aaron Mooy </strong>Huddersfield, loan.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Markus Suttner </strong>Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, \u00a32m; <strong>Matt Clarke </strong>Derby, loan; <strong>Anthony Knockaert </strong>Fulham, loan;<strong> Ben White </strong>Leeds, loan;<strong> Alexis MacAllister </strong>Boca Juniors, loan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7adfb2ed50d7f1d9b69fb4d5aaff8fb69ad938ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7adfb2ed50d7f1d9b69fb4d5aaff8fb69ad938ae/66_39_2008_1205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neal Maupay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neal Maupay after scoring for Brentford against Leeds last season.

The deadline day arrival of Danny Drinkwater from Chelsea brought yet more Premier League experience following Jay Rodriguez\u2019s return to his boyhood club and the signing of Erik Pieters from Stoke. A solid summer. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Jay Rodriguez </strong>West Brom, \u00a310m; <strong>Bailey Peacock-Farrell </strong>Leeds, \u00a33m;<strong> Erik Pieters </strong>Stoke, \u00a31.5m;<strong> Joel Senior </strong>Curzon Ashton, undiscl.;<strong>Ryan Cooney </strong>Bury, loan;<strong> Danny Drinkwater </strong>Chelsea, loan; <strong>Adam Phillips </strong>free.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Tom Heaton </strong>Aston Villa, \u00a38m; <strong>Peter Crouch </strong>released;<strong> Stephen Ward </strong>released;<strong> Anders Lindegaard </strong>released.</p> <h2>Chelsea</h2> <p>While Mateo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic arrived early, Chelsea had flown under the radar until the late drama of David Luiz\u2019s \u00a38m move to Arsenal. The club\u2019s transfer embargo has forced Frank Lampard to turn to the academy to refresh his squad \u2013 he has not been able to spend the funds generated by Eden Hazard\u2019s move to Real Madrid \u2013 and the focus has been on outgoings, with Danny Drinkwater loaned to Burnley on deadline day. Davide Zappacosta and Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko could also depart before the European transfer windows shut later this month. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Mateo Kovacic </strong>Real Madrid, \u00a340.2m; <strong>Christian Pulisic </strong>Borussia Dortmund, \u00a358m.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Eden Hazard </strong>Real Madrid, \u00a388.5m; <strong>Ola Aina </strong>Torino, \u00a38.8m;<strong> David Luiz </strong>Arsenal, \u00a38m;<strong>Tomas Kalas </strong>Bristol City, \u00a38m;<strong> Kasey Palmer </strong>Bristol City, \u00a33.5m; <strong>Ethan Ampadu </strong>RB Leipzig, loan;<strong> Lewis Baker </strong>Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, loan <strong>Jake Clarke-Salter </strong>Birmingham, loan; <strong>Danny Drinkwater </strong>Burnley, loan; <strong>Gary Cahill </strong>released.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/graham-potter-dean-smith-chris-wilder-premier-league-managers\">Enter English managers to show their worth and cause Premier League surprise</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Crystal Palace</h2> <p>With only \u00a36m spent on players after the \u00a345m sale of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, the news that Wilfried Zaha is staying at Selhurst Park was crucial for Palace\u2019s chances this season. But with Zaha having made no secret of his desire to move on, reintegrating the forward back into the squad could be tricky for Roy Hodgson but Palace will hope Zaha can return to the form that helped them survive relegation with ease last season. The pressure is on Christian Benteke to deliver goals in the last year of his contract. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <p><strong>Ins: Jordan Ayew </strong>Swansea, \u00a33m; <strong>James McCarthy </strong>Everton, \u00a33m;<strong> Gary Cahill </strong>Chelsea, free;<strong> Victor Camarasa </strong>Real Betis, loan;<strong>Stephen Henderson </strong>free.</p> <p><strong>Outs: Aaron Wan-Bissaka </strong>Manchester United, \u00a345m; <strong>Julian Speroni </strong>released;<strong> Bakary Sako </strong>released; <strong>Jason Puncheon </strong>released; <strong>Alexander S\u00f8rloth </strong>Trabzonspor, loan;<strong> Pape Souar\u00e9 </strong>released.</p> <h2>Everton</h2> <p>A productive, well-planned window came to something of a haphazard end with attention switched late to Alex Iwobi after the thwarted pursuit of Wilfried Zaha and the priority of a new central defender going unresolved. Other key areas were addressed by signing players with title-winning experience in Spain, Italy and England.

Elsewhere, they have recruited well. Securing Youri Tielemans on a permanent transfer was a coup, his compatriot Dennis Praet could contribute more goals from midfield and Ayoze P\u00e9rez is a shrewd addition to the attack. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Youri Tielemans </strong>Monaco, \u00a340m; <strong>Ayoze P\u00e9rez </strong>Newcastle, \u00a330m; <strong>Dennis Praet </strong>Sampdoria, \u00a318m;<strong> James Justin </strong>Luton, \u00a38m;<strong> Mitchell Clark </strong>Aston Villa, free; <strong>Vontae Daley-Campbell </strong>Arsenal, undiscl;<strong> George Hirst </strong>Leuven, undiscl;<strong> Ali Reghba </strong>Bohemians, undiscl.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Harry Maguire </strong>Man Utd, \u00a380m; <strong>Shinji Okazaki </strong>M\u00e1laga, free;<strong> Danny Simpson </strong>released.</p> <h2>Liverpool</h2> <p>J\u00fcrgen Klopp always said this window would be quiet for Liverpool, with the club having invested heavily in signings last year and lucrative contract extensions subsequently, but just how quiet was a surprise given their position of strength as European champions. The only senior addition was the goalkeeper Adri\u00e1n on a free transfer as a replacement for Simon Mignolet, while Sepp van den Berg, 17 and Harvey Elliott, 16, were acquired for the future. <strong>A</strong><strong>H</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Sepp van den Berg </strong>Zwolle, \u00a31.3m; <strong>Harvey Elliott </strong>Fulham, undisclosed;<strong> Adri\u00e1n </strong>free</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Danny Ings </strong>Southampton, \u00a318m; <strong>Simon Mignolet </strong>Club Brugge, \u00a36.4m;<strong> Rafael Camacho </strong>Sporting, \u00a35m;<strong> Daniel Sturridge </strong>free; <strong>Alberto Moreno </strong>Villarreal, free;<strong> Sheyi Ojo </strong>Rangers, loan; <strong>Marko Grujic </strong>Hertha Berlin, loan; <strong>Harry Wilson </strong>Bournemouth, loan.</p> <h2>Manchester City</h2> <p>Pep Guardiola lamented that he \u201ccould not afford\u201d Harry Maguire after the Leicester centre-back joined city rivals United but the Manchester City manager has reasons to be pleased with this summer window. Rodri looks like an excellent signing and will allow Fernandinho to have a breather (or play in defence) every now and then, while City look to have had the better out of the Jo\u00e3o Cancelo-Danilo swap deal despite paying Juve \u00a330m as part of the arrangement. <strong>Marcus Christenson</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Rodri </strong>Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, \u00a362.6m; <strong>Jo\u00e3o Cancelo </strong>Juventus, \u00a360m;<strong> Angeli\u00f1o </strong>PSV, \u00a35.3m, <strong>Pedro Porro </strong>Girona, undiscl.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Danilo </strong>Juventus, \u00a332.3m; <strong>Dougla</strong><strong>s Luiz </strong>Aston Villa, \u00a315m; <strong>Fabian Delph </strong>Everton, \u00a38.5m;<strong> Manu Garc\u00eda </strong>Sporting Gij\u00f3n, \u00a33.6m; <strong>Taylor Richards </strong>Brighton, \u00a32.5m;<strong> Thierry Ambrose </strong>Metz, \u00a32.3m; <strong>Pablo Mar\u00ed </strong>Flamengo, \u00a31.5m; <strong>Patrick Roberts </strong>Norwich, loan.</p> <h2>Manchester United</h2> <p>At some points during the summer it threatened to turn into quite a positive window for United and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r but in the end there was a sense of deflation. True, Harry Maguire has joined for \u00a380m and Aaron Wan-Bissaka for \u00a345m but the midfield needed more than Daniel James and the squad is now light up front with Romelu Lukaku leaving. United were interested in signing Paulo Dybala but that proved too expensive \u2013 but the main question is: why leave it so late? It\u2019s another window Ed Woodward has not come out of well. <strong>M</strong><strong>C</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Harry Maguire </strong>Leicester, \u00a380m; <strong>Aaron Wan\u2011Bissaka </strong>Crystal Palace, \u00a345m;<strong> Daniel James </strong>Swansea, \u00a315m.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Romelu Lukaku </strong>Inter, \u00a370m; <strong>Ander Herrera </strong>PSG, free; <strong>Antonio Valencia </strong>LDU Quito, free.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fd91da311feabf7385be3dedf8d29d0fddff529\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fd91da311feabf7385be3dedf8d29d0fddff529/0_171_4060_2436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Maguire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United will be hoping Harry Maguire\u2019s leadership skills and defensive qualities pay off after his signing from Leicester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Newcastle United</h2> <p>Newcastle\u2019s refusal to sell Sean Longstaff \u2013 one of England\u2019s finest young midfielders \u2013 to Manchester United arguably represents their best business decision this window. If investing around \u00a360m on Joelinton and Allan Saint-Maximin seems a gamble from the new manager Steve Bruce at least they bring much needed pace. Meanwhile Andy Carroll \u2013 when fit \u2013 will add a new atttacking dimension to a squad who have been well reinforced in both full-back positions. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Joelinton </strong>Hoffenheim \u00a340m; <strong>Allan Saint\u2011Maximin </strong>Nice \u00a316.5m;<strong> Emil Krafth </strong>Amiens \u00a35m;<strong> Kyle Scott </strong>Chelsea free; <strong>Jake Turner </strong>Bolton free;<strong> Jetro Willems </strong>Eintracht Frankfurt loan; <strong>Andy Carroll </strong>free<strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Major outs: Ayoze P\u00e9rez </strong>Leicester \u00a330m; <strong>Joselu </strong>Alav\u00e9s \u00a32.5m;<strong> Dan Barlaser </strong>Rotherham loan;<strong> Mohamed Diam\u00e9 </strong>released; <strong>Liam Gibson </strong>Grimsby loan;<strong> Freddie Woodman </strong>Swansea loan.</p> <h2>Norwich City</h2> <p>Norwich\u2019s best business was securing a series of young (and not so young) talents to new contracts. Second best was probably the signing of the defensive midfielder Ibrahim Amadou on loan from Sevilla, the one position where a starting XI option was desperately needed. Cover at goalkeeper, right-back and centre-forward has also come in, with the winger Patrick Roberts a wild-card loan deal from Manchester City. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins</strong></p> <p><strong>Sam Byram </strong>West Ham, \u00a3750k; <strong>Aidan Fitzpatrick </strong>Patrick Thistle, \u00a3350k;<strong> Patrick Roberts </strong>Manchester City, loan; <strong>Daniel Adshead </strong>Rochdale, undiscl;<strong>Josip Drmic </strong>Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, free;<strong> Archie Mair </strong>Abderden, undiscl;<strong> Rob Nizet </strong>Anderlecht, undiscl; <strong>Rocky Bushiri </strong>Oostende, undiscl;<strong> Ralf F\u00e4hrmann </strong>Schalke, loan; <strong>Charlie Gilmour </strong>Arsenal, free; <strong>Ibrahim Amadou </strong>Sevilla, loan.</p> <p><strong>Major outs</strong></p> <p><strong>Matt Jarvis </strong>released; <strong>Ivo Pinto </strong>Dinamo Zagreb, free;<strong> Steven Naismith </strong>released;<strong> Adam Phillips </strong>Burnley, free.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/08/gareth-bale-saga-transfer-window-neymar-koscielny-eni-aluko\">Gareth Bale saga is a spiteful tale in a window that has turned murky | Eni Aluko</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Sheffield United</h2> <p>The Blades will be delighted with their work over a summer in which they broke their transfer record four times in as many weeks. Luke Freeman was the first, swiftly followed by Callum Robinson, Lys Mousset and finally \u00a318m Oli McBurnie. That means they have strengthened exactly where the side needed it \u2013 in attacking areas. A deadline day move for Everton\u2019s Mo Besic adds a bit of snarl in midfield when required. <strong>John Ashdown</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Oli McBurnie </strong>Swansea, \u00a318m; <strong>Lys Mousset </strong>Bournemouth, \u00a310m;<strong> Callum Robinson </strong>Preston, \u00a38m; <strong>Luke Freeman</strong> QPR, 5m; <strong>Ben Osborn </strong>Nottm Forest \u00a33.5m; <strong>Phil Jagielka </strong>Everton, free;<strong> Ravel Morrison </strong>free; <strong>Michael Verrips </strong>Mechelen, free; <strong>Dean Henderson </strong>Manchester United, loan; <strong>Mo Besic </strong>Everton, loan.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Conor Washington </strong>Hearts, free; <strong>Martin Cranie </strong>Luton, free;<strong> Ched Evans </strong>Fleetwood, undiscl;<strong> Rhys Norrington-Davies </strong>Rochdale, free; <strong>Mark Duffy </strong>Stoke loan.</p> <h2>Southampton</h2> <p>Southampton needed to clear the dead wood this summer but doing so has proved easier said than done. Charlie Austin has departed but high-earners have reduced Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s capacity to upgrade his squad sufficiently, with Fraser Forster and Guido Carrillo among those dispensable players eating up the wage bill. Che Adams looks a steal at \u00a315m and Moussa Djenepo, a raw winger, should stimulate supporters but as one deadline closes all eyes are on the European deadline on 2 September by which point Saints hope to have offloaded Mario Lemina. <strong>BF</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Moussa Djenepo </strong>Standard Li\u00e8ge, \u00a314m;<strong>Che Adams </strong>Birmingham, \u00a315m;<strong> Danny Ings </strong>Liverpool, \u00a318m.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Matt Targett </strong>Aston Villa, \u00a313m; <strong>Sam Gallagher </strong>Blackburn, \u00a35m;<strong> Charlie Austin </strong>West Brom, \u00a34m.</p> <h2>Tottenham Hotspur</h2> <p>After two windows of inactivity, Spurs made up for lost time with the late arrivals of Ryan Sessegnon and Giovani Lo Celso on deadline day but failed to secure an audacious move for Paulo Dybala and find a buyer for Danny Rose. There are still concerns over a lack of cover at right-back following the sale of Kieran Trippier to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid but Mauricio Pochettino will still feel he has improved the squad who reached the Champions League final last season. Now to win a trophy perhaps? <strong>EA</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Tanguy Ndombele </strong>Lyon, \u00a355.5m; <strong>Jack Clarke </strong>Leeds, \u00a310m;<strong> Giovani Lo Celso </strong>Real Betis, loan;<strong> Ryan Sessegnon </strong>Fulham, \u00a325m.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Kieran Trippier </strong>Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, \u00a320m; <strong>Vincent Janssen </strong>Monterrey, \u00a36.3m;<strong> Michel Vorm </strong>released;<strong> Fernando Llorente </strong>released;<strong> Tobi Oluwayemi </strong>Celtic, undiscl.</p> <h2>Watford</h2> <p>A flurry of late activity during which Watford completed deals for Danny Welbeck and the Senegal forward Isma\u00efla Sarr has given supporters hope of at least emulating the team\u2019s exploits under Javi Gracia last season, although the failure to sign Danny Rose from Tottenham at the last minute was a slight setback. Nonetheless the potential of Sarr and the Nigerian teenager Tom Dele-Bashiru should give cause for optimism for the future, as should keeping hold of their most crucial performers. <strong>EA</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins: Isma\u00efla Sarr </strong>Rennes, \u00a330m; <strong>Danny Welbeck </strong>Arsenal, free;<strong> Bayli Spencer-Adams </strong>Arsenal, free;<strong> Joseph Hungbo </strong>Crystal Palace, free; <strong>Sam Dalby </strong>Leeds, undiscl;<strong> Tom Dele\u2011Bashiru </strong>Manchester City, free.</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Dodi Lukebakio </strong>Hertha Berlin, \u00a318m; <strong>Miguel Britos </strong>released;<strong> Obbi Oular\u00e9 </strong>Standard Li\u00e8ge, undiscl.;<strong> Jerome Sinclair </strong>VVV-Venlo, loan.</p> <h2>West Ham United</h2> <p>It has been a decent summer for Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side. Unwanted players have departed, Pablo Fornals looks an exciting addition in midfield and West Ham have reacted well to losing Marko Arnautovic, replacing the disruptive Austrian forward with S\u00e9bastien Haller and Albian Ajeti. They broke their transfer record to sign Haller from Eintracht Frankfurt and Ajeti, a 22-year-old Swiss international, scored 15 goals for FC Basel last season. The concern, however, is that Pellegrini has not focused on strengthening a suspect defence, either by recruiting better full-backs or signing cover in defensive midfield. <strong>J</strong><strong>S</strong></p> <p><strong>Major ins</strong>: <strong>S\u00e9bastien Haller </strong>Eintracht Frankfurt \u00a340.7m; <strong>Pablo Fornals </strong>Villarreal, \u00a324m;<strong> Albian Ajeti </strong>Basel, \u00a38m; <strong>Gon\u00e7alo Cardoso </strong>Boavista, undiscl</p> <p><strong>Major outs: Marko Arnautovic </strong>Shanghai SIPG, \u00a322.4m; <strong>Edimilson Fernandes </strong>Mainz, \u00a38m;<strong> Pedro Obiang </strong>Sassuolo, \u00a37.2m;<strong> Reece Oxford </strong>Augsburg, \u00a33.6m; <strong>Lucas P\u00e9rez </strong>Alav\u00e9s, \u00a32m;<strong> Sam Byram </strong>Norwich, \u00a3750k<strong>; Andy Carroll </strong>Newcastle, free.</p> <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers</h2> <p>Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo likes to keep his squad tight so did not demand massive reinforcements despite Wolves\u2019 European commitments. That risks leaving them vulnerable to a spate of injuries. On the plus side, they have retained the players who excelled last term, turning loans for Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and Leander Dendonker into permanent deals.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal Whisper it but Arsenal have completed a transfer window more or less to their satisfaction. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 and Kieran Tierney are signings of the right age and profile who should provide incision from the flanks while David Luiz\u2019s arrival is a curveball but, after Laurent Koscielny\u2019s unsavoury departure, makes sense from a leadership perspective. If Dani Ceballos settles they have a potential star on their hands and Alex Iwobi\u2019s departure helps balance the books. Nick Ames Major ins: Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 Lille \u00a372m; William Saliba St\u2011\u00c9tienne \u00a327m; Kieran Tierney Celtic \u00a325m David Luiz Chelsea \u00a38m; Gabriel Martinelli Ituano \u00a36m; Dani Ceballos Real Madrid loan.

Aston Villa For the pessimist, Villa\u2019s \u00a3146m spend on 13 new signings might summon memories of the trolley dash Fulham embarked upon last year. But Dean Smith has done enough to earn some trust and a more positive slant is that Villa have set themselves up for a return to where they believe they belong, among the division\u2019s established teams. Wesley Moraes, Trezeguet and Jota should enliven their attack while Douglas Luiz looks a very smart addition. NA Major ins: Tyrone Mings Bournemouth, \u00a326.5m; Wesley Moraes Club Brugge, \u00a322m; Douglas Luiz Manchester City, \u00a315m; Matt Targett Southampton, \u00a314m; Ezri Konsa Brentford, \u00a312m; Marvelous Nakamba Club Brugge, \u00a311m; Bj\u00f6rn Engels Reims, \u00a39m; Trezeguet Kasimpasa, \u00a38.8m; Tom Heaton Burnley, \u00a38m; Anwar El Ghazi Lille, \u00a38m; Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert Caen, \u00a35m; Jota Birmingham, \u00a34m; Kortney Hause Wolves, \u00a33m. Major outs: Glenn Whelan released; Ritchie De Laet released; Alan Hutton released; Mile Jedinak released; Micah Richards released. Bournemouth It has been a satisfying summer for Bournemouth, with Eddie Howe improving his squad with the arrivals of Philip Billing and Harry Wilson, on a season\u2019s loan, the most eye-catching. But tying down Callum Wilson to a four-year contract was arguably Bournemouth\u2019s best piece of business, with Nathan Ake and Ryan Fraser also sticking around. Injuries to David Brooks, Lloyd Kelly and Dan Gosling have dampened enthusiasm but they look ready to build on last season\u2019s 14th place. Ben Fisher Major ins: Philip Billing Huddersfield, \u00a315m; Lloyd Kelly Bristol City, \u00a313m; Arnaut Danjuma Club Brugge, \u00a313m; Jack Stacey Luton, \u00a34m; Harry Wilson Liverpool, loan. Major outs: Tyrone Mings Aston Villa, \u00a326.5m; Lys Mousset Sheffield United, \u00a310m; Harry Arter Fulham, loan. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Graham Potter\u2019s task at Brighton has been considerably eased by a flurry of signings across the past week. The arrival of Neal Maupay, Aaron Mooy and Adam Webster from Brentford, Huddersfield and Bristol City respectively, strengthens the spine of a team who had gone stale under Chris Hughton. Coupled with Leandro Trossard, who has shown glimpses of class in pre-season, Potter has plenty of ammunition, including Alireza Jahanbakhsh and J\u00fcrgen Locadia, who have so far underwhelmed on the south coast. BF Major ins: Neal Maupay Brentford, \u00a320m; Adam Webster Bristol City, \u00a320m; Leandro Trossard Genk, \u00a315m; Matt Clarke Portsmouth, \u00a35m; Taylor Richards Manchester City, \u00a32.5m; Romaric Yapi Paris St-Germain, undisclosed; Aaron Mooy Huddersfield, loan. Major outs: Markus Suttner Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, \u00a32m; Matt Clarke Derby, loan; Anthony Knockaert Fulham, loan; Ben White Leeds, loan; Alexis MacAllister Boca Juniors, loan. Burnley Losing Tom Heaton for \u00a38m to Aston Villa was a blow for Sean Dyche, even with the England goalkeeper in the final year of his contract at Turf Moor, but if the aim of any transfer window is to finish with a stronger squad then Burnley can be satisfied. The deadline day arrival of Danny Drinkwater from Chelsea brought yet more Premier League experience following Jay Rodriguez\u2019s return to his boyhood club and the signing of Erik Pieters from Stoke. A solid summer. Andy Hunter Major ins: Jay Rodriguez West Brom, \u00a310m; Bailey Peacock-Farrell Leeds, \u00a33m; Erik Pieters Stoke, \u00a31.5m; Joel Senior Curzon Ashton, undiscl.;Ryan Cooney Bury, loan; Danny Drinkwater Chelsea, loan; Adam Phillips free. Major outs: Tom Heaton Aston Villa, \u00a38m; Peter Crouch released; Stephen Ward released; Anders Lindegaard released. Chelsea While Mateo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic arrived early, Chelsea had flown under the radar until the late drama of David Luiz\u2019s \u00a38m move to Arsenal. The club\u2019s transfer embargo has forced Frank Lampard to turn to the academy to refresh his squad \u2013 he has not been able to spend the funds generated by Eden Hazard\u2019s move to Real Madrid \u2013 and the focus has been on outgoings, with Danny Drinkwater loaned to Burnley on deadline day. Davide Zappacosta and Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko could also depart before the European transfer windows shut later this month. Jacob Steinberg Major ins: Mateo Kovacic Real Madrid, \u00a340.2m; Christian Pulisic Borussia Dortmund, \u00a358m. Major outs: Eden Hazard Real Madrid, \u00a388.5m; Ola Aina Torino, \u00a38.8m; David Luiz Arsenal, \u00a38m;Tomas Kalas Bristol City, \u00a38m; Kasey Palmer Bristol City, \u00a33.5m; Ethan Ampadu RB Leipzig, loan; Lewis Baker Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, loan Jake Clarke-Salter Birmingham, loan; Danny Drinkwater Burnley, loan; Gary Cahill released. Crystal Palace With only \u00a36m spent on players after the \u00a345m sale of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, the news that Wilfried Zaha is staying at Selhurst Park was crucial for Palace\u2019s chances this season. But with Zaha having made no secret of his desire to move on, reintegrating the forward back into the squad could be tricky for Roy Hodgson but Palace will hope Zaha can return to the form that helped them survive relegation with ease last season. The pressure is on Christian Benteke to deliver goals in the last year of his contract. Ed Aarons Ins: Jordan Ayew Swansea, \u00a33m; James McCarthy Everton, \u00a33m; Gary Cahill Chelsea, free; Victor Camarasa Real Betis, loan;Stephen Henderson free. Outs: Aaron Wan-Bissaka Manchester United, \u00a345m; Julian Speroni released; Bakary Sako released; Jason Puncheon released; Alexander S\u00f8rloth Trabzonspor, loan; Pape Souar\u00e9 released. Everton A productive, well-planned window came to something of a haphazard end with attention switched late to Alex Iwobi after the thwarted pursuit of Wilfried Zaha and the priority of a new central defender going unresolved. Other key areas were addressed by signing players with title-winning experience in Spain, Italy and England. The damaging departure of Idrissa Gueye was covered swiftly and over 20 players were removed off a previously soaring wage bill. AH Major ins: Moise Kean Juventus, \u00a329m; Jean-Philippe Gbamin Mainz, \u00a322.5m; Andr\u00e9 Gomes Barcelona, \u00a322m; Fabian Delph Man City, \u00a38.5m; Djibril Sidib\u00e9 Monaco, loan; Alex Iwobi Arsenal, \u00a335m. Major outs: Idrissa Gueye PSG, \u00a329m; Ademola Lookman RB Leipzig, \u00a322.5m; Nikola Vlasic CSKA Moscow, \u00a312m; James McCarthy Crystal Palace, \u00a33m; Ashley Williams released; Jonjoe Kenny Schalke, loan; Sandro Ram\u00edrez Real Valladolid, loan. Mo Besic Sheffield Utd, loan. Leicester City Leicester got a good fee for Harry Maguire but the deal did not leave them enough time to buy a replacement so there are question marks in central defence, where Jonny Evans will need to stay fit and either Caglar Soyuncu or Filip Benkovic will have to step up. Elsewhere, they have recruited well. Securing Youri Tielemans on a permanent transfer was a coup, his compatriot Dennis Praet could contribute more goals from midfield and Ayoze P\u00e9rez is a shrewd addition to the attack. Paul Doyle Major ins: Youri Tielemans Monaco, \u00a340m; Ayoze P\u00e9rez Newcastle, \u00a330m; Dennis Praet Sampdoria, \u00a318m; James Justin Luton, \u00a38m; Mitchell Clark Aston Villa, free; Vontae Daley-Campbell Arsenal, undiscl; George Hirst Leuven, undiscl; Ali Reghba Bohemians, undiscl. Major outs: Harry Maguire Man Utd, \u00a380m; Shinji Okazaki M\u00e1laga, free; Danny Simpson released. Liverpool J\u00fcrgen Klopp always said this window would be quiet for Liverpool, with the club having invested heavily in signings last year and lucrative contract extensions subsequently, but just how quiet was a surprise given their position of strength as European champions. The only senior addition was the goalkeeper Adri\u00e1n on a free transfer as a replacement for Simon Mignolet, while Sepp van den Berg, 17 and Harvey Elliott, 16, were acquired for the future. AH Major ins: Sepp van den Berg Zwolle, \u00a31.3m; Harvey Elliott Fulham, undisclosed; Adri\u00e1n free Major outs: Danny Ings Southampton, \u00a318m; Simon Mignolet Club Brugge, \u00a36.4m; Rafael Camacho Sporting, \u00a35m; Daniel Sturridge free; Alberto Moreno Villarreal, free; Sheyi Ojo Rangers, loan; Marko Grujic Hertha Berlin, loan; Harry Wilson Bournemouth, loan. Manchester City Pep Guardiola lamented that he \u201ccould not afford\u201d Harry Maguire after the Leicester centre-back joined city rivals United but the Manchester City manager has reasons to be pleased with this summer window. Rodri looks like an excellent signing and will allow Fernandinho to have a breather (or play in defence) every now and then, while City look to have had the better out of the Jo\u00e3o Cancelo-Danilo swap deal despite paying Juve \u00a330m as part of the arrangement. Marcus Christenson Major ins: Rodri Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, \u00a362.6m; Jo\u00e3o Cancelo Juventus, \u00a360m; Angeli\u00f1o PSV, \u00a35.3m, Pedro Porro Girona, undiscl. Major outs: Danilo Juventus, \u00a332.3m; Douglas Luiz Aston Villa, \u00a315m; Fabian Delph Everton, \u00a38.5m; Manu Garc\u00eda Sporting Gij\u00f3n, \u00a33.6m; Taylor Richards Brighton, \u00a32.5m; Thierry Ambrose Metz, \u00a32.3m; Pablo Mar\u00ed Flamengo, \u00a31.5m; Patrick Roberts Norwich, loan. Manchester United At some points during the summer it threatened to turn into quite a positive window for United and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r but in the end there was a sense of deflation. True, Harry Maguire has joined for \u00a380m and Aaron Wan-Bissaka for \u00a345m but the midfield needed more than Daniel James and the squad is now light up front with Romelu Lukaku leaving. United were interested in signing Paulo Dybala but that proved too expensive \u2013 but the main question is: why leave it so late? It\u2019s another window Ed Woodward has not come out of well. MC Major ins: Harry Maguire Leicester, \u00a380m; Aaron Wan\u2011Bissaka Crystal Palace, \u00a345m; Daniel James Swansea, \u00a315m. Major outs: Romelu Lukaku Inter, \u00a370m; Ander Herrera PSG, free; Antonio Valencia LDU Quito, free. Newcastle United Newcastle\u2019s refusal to sell Sean Longstaff \u2013 one of England\u2019s finest young midfielders \u2013 to Manchester United arguably represents their best business decision this window. If investing around \u00a360m on Joelinton and Allan Saint-Maximin seems a gamble from the new manager Steve Bruce at least they bring much needed pace. Meanwhile Andy Carroll \u2013 when fit \u2013 will add a new atttacking dimension to a squad who have been well reinforced in both full-back positions. Louise Taylor Major ins: Joelinton Hoffenheim \u00a340m; Allan Saint\u2011Maximin Nice \u00a316.5m; Emil Krafth Amiens \u00a35m; Kyle Scott Chelsea free; Jake Turner Bolton free; Jetro Willems Eintracht Frankfurt loan; Andy Carroll free.

Norwich City Norwich\u2019s best business was securing a series of young (and not so young) talents to new contracts. Second best was probably the signing of the defensive midfielder Ibrahim Amadou on loan from Sevilla, the one position where a starting XI option was desperately needed. Cover at goalkeeper, right-back and centre-forward has also come in, with the winger Patrick Roberts a wild-card loan deal from Manchester City. Paul MacInnes Major ins Sam Byram West Ham, \u00a3750k; Aidan Fitzpatrick Patrick Thistle, \u00a3350k; Patrick Roberts Manchester City, loan; Daniel Adshead Rochdale, undiscl;Josip Drmic Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, free; Archie Mair Abderden, undiscl; Rob Nizet Anderlecht, undiscl; Rocky Bushiri Oostende, undiscl; Ralf F\u00e4hrmann Schalke, loan; Charlie Gilmour Arsenal, free; Ibrahim Amadou Sevilla, loan. Major outs Matt Jarvis released; Ivo Pinto Dinamo Zagreb, free; Steven Naismith released; Adam Phillips Burnley, free. Sheffield United The Blades will be delighted with their work over a summer in which they broke their transfer record four times in as many weeks. Luke Freeman was the first, swiftly followed by Callum Robinson, Lys Mousset and finally \u00a318m Oli McBurnie. That means they have strengthened exactly where the side needed it \u2013 in attacking areas. A deadline day move for Everton\u2019s Mo Besic adds a bit of snarl in midfield when required. John Ashdown Major ins: Oli McBurnie Swansea, \u00a318m; Lys Mousset Bournemouth, \u00a310m; Callum Robinson Preston, \u00a38m; Luke Freeman QPR, 5m; Ben Osborn Nottm Forest \u00a33.5m; Phil Jagielka Everton, free; Ravel Morrison free; Michael Verrips Mechelen, free; Dean Henderson Manchester United, loan; Mo Besic Everton, loan. Major outs: Conor Washington Hearts, free; Martin Cranie Luton, free; Ched Evans Fleetwood, undiscl; Rhys Norrington-Davies Rochdale, free; Mark Duffy Stoke loan. Southampton Southampton needed to clear the dead wood this summer but doing so has proved easier said than done. Charlie Austin has departed but high-earners have reduced Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s capacity to upgrade his squad sufficiently, with Fraser Forster and Guido Carrillo among those dispensable players eating up the wage bill. Che Adams looks a steal at \u00a315m and Moussa Djenepo, a raw winger, should stimulate supporters but as one deadline closes all eyes are on the European deadline on 2 September by which point Saints hope to have offloaded Mario Lemina. BF Major ins: Moussa Djenepo Standard Li\u00e8ge, \u00a314m;Che Adams Birmingham, \u00a315m; Danny Ings Liverpool, \u00a318m. Major outs: Matt Targett Aston Villa, \u00a313m; Sam Gallagher Blackburn, \u00a35m; Charlie Austin West Brom, \u00a34m. Tottenham Hotspur After two windows of inactivity, Spurs made up for lost time with the late arrivals of Ryan Sessegnon and Giovani Lo Celso on deadline day but failed to secure an audacious move for Paulo Dybala and find a buyer for Danny Rose. There are still concerns over a lack of cover at right-back following the sale of Kieran Trippier to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid but Mauricio Pochettino will still feel he has improved the squad who reached the Champions League final last season. Now to win a trophy perhaps? EA Major ins: Tanguy Ndombele Lyon, \u00a355.5m; Jack Clarke Leeds, \u00a310m; Giovani Lo Celso Real Betis, loan; Ryan Sessegnon Fulham, \u00a325m. Major outs: Kieran Trippier Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, \u00a320m; Vincent Janssen Monterrey, \u00a36.3m; Michel Vorm released; Fernando Llorente released; Tobi Oluwayemi Celtic, undiscl. Watford A flurry of late activity during which Watford completed deals for Danny Welbeck and the Senegal forward Isma\u00efla Sarr has given supporters hope of at least emulating the team\u2019s exploits under Javi Gracia last season, although the failure to sign Danny Rose from Tottenham at the last minute was a slight setback. Nonetheless the potential of Sarr and the Nigerian teenager Tom Dele-Bashiru should give cause for optimism for the future, as should keeping hold of their most crucial performers. EA Major ins: Isma\u00efla Sarr Rennes, \u00a330m; Danny Welbeck Arsenal, free; Bayli Spencer-Adams Arsenal, free; Joseph Hungbo Crystal Palace, free; Sam Dalby Leeds, undiscl; Tom Dele\u2011Bashiru Manchester City, free. Major outs: Dodi Lukebakio Hertha Berlin, \u00a318m; Miguel Britos released; Obbi Oular\u00e9 Standard Li\u00e8ge, undiscl.; Jerome Sinclair VVV-Venlo, loan. West Ham United It has been a decent summer for Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side. Unwanted players have departed, Pablo Fornals looks an exciting addition in midfield and West Ham have reacted well to losing Marko Arnautovic, replacing the disruptive Austrian forward with S\u00e9bastien Haller and Albian Ajeti. They broke their transfer record to sign Haller from Eintracht Frankfurt and Ajeti, a 22-year-old Swiss international, scored 15 goals for FC Basel last season. The concern, however, is that Pellegrini has not focused on strengthening a suspect defence, either by recruiting better full-backs or signing cover in defensive midfield. JS Major ins: S\u00e9bastien Haller Eintracht Frankfurt \u00a340.7m; Pablo Fornals Villarreal, \u00a324m; Albian Ajeti Basel, \u00a38m; Gon\u00e7alo Cardoso Boavista, undiscl Major outs: Marko Arnautovic Shanghai SIPG, \u00a322.4m; Edimilson Fernandes Mainz, \u00a38m; Pedro Obiang Sassuolo, \u00a37.2m; Reece Oxford Augsburg, \u00a33.6m; Lucas P\u00e9rez Alav\u00e9s, \u00a32m; Sam Byram Norwich, \u00a3750k; Andy Carroll Newcastle, free. Wolverhampton Wanderers Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo likes to keep his squad tight so did not demand massive reinforcements despite Wolves\u2019 European commitments. That risks leaving them vulnerable to a spate of injuries. On the plus side, they have retained the players who excelled last term, turning loans for Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and Leander Dendonker into permanent deals. The few newcomers offer promise, especially the powerful striker Patrick Cutrone and the centre-back Jes\u00fas Vallejo, who joined after leading Spain to victory at the U-21 European Championship. PD Major ins: Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez Benfica, \u00a330m; Patrick Cutrone Milan, \u00a316.2m; Leander Dendoncker Anderlecht, \u00a312m; Pedro Neto Lazio, \u00a310.8m; Bruno Jord\u00e3o Lazio, \u00a37.2m; Jes\u00fas Vallejo Real Madrid, loan; Renat Dadashov Estoril, undiscl Major outs: Kortney Hause Aston Villa, \u00a33m; Renat Dadashov Pa\u00e7os Ferreira, loan; H\u00e9lder Costa Leeds, loan; Ivan Cavaleiro Fulham, loan.",

      "body": "<p>In less than a week since it was broadcast on the BBC, Jeremy Deller\u2019s Everybody in the Place: An Incomplete History of Britain 1984-1992 has enveloped viewers in a loved-up embrace. Across social media, even hard bitten, seen-it-all old ravers have been celebrating the film \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000777d/everybody-in-the-place-an-incomplete-history-of-britain-19841992\" title=\"\">now on iPlayer</a> \u2013 and Deller says feedback he has had on Twitter has been almost universally good, \u201capart from one guy with a Brexit party icon who said \u2018I was expecting to relive the best days of my life but you\u2019ve ruined it with this leftwing propaganda\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>The premise of the documentary is pretty straightforward: contextualising the acid house/rave moment in the social movements of the 1980s: the miners\u2019 strike, the Traveller convoys, British-Caribbean soundsystem culture and, of course, the LGBT culture of Chicago that birthed house itself. But rather than, as Deller puts it, \u201cthe standard BBC Four documentary where it\u2019s middle-aged men talking with their record collections behind them, then some unattributed archive and a voiceover\u201d, it\u2019s structured more interestingly \u2013 as you would hope from a Turner prize-winning artist such as Deller.</p> <p>Not only is the archive footage carefully sourced to avoid the familiar and presented in longer chunks than usual \u2013 \u201ca minute or two at a time, so you can delve into it, absorb it, take it seriously, get lost in it, almost\u201d \u2013 it is framed as a lecture by Deller, delivered to a class of A-level politics students, whose often bemused reactions are as important as the material presented. Looking partially through the eyes of people born in 2002 and 2003 really makes 1989 look like another world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9cefe51d1a9ca25a2ece448073f9a13fb8fd44fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cefe51d1a9ca25a2ece448073f9a13fb8fd44fb/140_0_1353_812/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Deller during Everybody in the Place.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Deller during Everybody in the Place.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Deller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is clearly something in the air right now. The film comes as the Sweet Harmony exhibition (named, like Everybody in the Place, after an XL Records rave hit) is running at the Saatchi gallery in London, while the buzz is still high on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/19/beats-review-90s-rave-culture-coming-of-age-drama\" title=\"\">Brian Welsh\u2019s independent movie Beats</a>, a delightfully touching \u201cuniversal story of friendship, rebellion and the irresistible power of gathered youth\u201d set around the Scottish rave scene in 1994. At a recent Q&amp;A with Welsh following a screening of his film, it was striking how much the audience was dominated by people who were not born when the film is set \u2013 and their fascination with the details of the rave movement was palpable. Meanwhile, Radio 1 playlists are full of records by contemporary artists such as Chase &amp; Status and High Contrast, who hark back to early 90s moments of rave intensity.</p> <p>Why this sudden interest? \u201cNow and the 80s,\u201d says Deller, \u201care both eras that are quite rightwing, reactionary moments in British history, and music and popular culture are good ways to explore people\u2019s reactions to that.\u201d Even around the 2008 economic crash, he thinks, when 20 years of acid house could have been a significant milestone, \u201cI don\u2019t think we knew what we were in for\u201d. It is only now, after nearly 10 years of coalition/Tory rule, that the conditions a decade of Thatcherism fomented seem grimly familiar.</p> <p>\u201cAlso,\u201d Deller says, \u201cI think it\u2019s the media. For a very long time during and after, people didn\u2019t take the movement seriously. The media was still obsessed with punk and rock music, with that Bob Dylan sense that everything had to have \u2018meaningful\u2019 lyrics. And then with Britpop, which was for the most part reactionary, comforting and familiar.

They were interested in technology before rave, then they got into rave where you had this whole futuristic vision with robots, VR, video games, electronic music and mobile phones getting some of their first use to organise parties \u2013 then Staines applied the same mentality to politics: his website is anti-establishment, disruptive, cheeky, but very seriously political. He\u2019s not on our side, but this is what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Staines was, it turns out, delighted by Deller\u2019s description of him as \u201can agent of chaos\u201d.</p> <p>For all that Deller quotes Marx in the film, and depicts social movements with some of the romantic fervour of a convert, he didn\u2019t go to the biggest raves of the acid era and was only seriously drawn into the culture towards the end of the period covered in the film. It is really a story about complexity and ambiguity in British cultural history.

      "bodyText": "In less than a week since it was broadcast on the BBC, Jeremy Deller\u2019s Everybody in the Place: An Incomplete History of Britain 1984-1992 has enveloped viewers in a loved-up embrace. Across social media, even hard bitten, seen-it-all old ravers have been celebrating the film \u2013 now on iPlayer \u2013 and Deller says feedback he has had on Twitter has been almost universally good, \u201capart from one guy with a Brexit party icon who said \u2018I was expecting to relive the best days of my life but you\u2019ve ruined it with this leftwing propaganda\u2019\u201d. The premise of the documentary is pretty straightforward: contextualising the acid house/rave moment in the social movements of the 1980s: the miners\u2019 strike, the Traveller convoys, British-Caribbean soundsystem culture and, of course, the LGBT culture of Chicago that birthed house itself. But rather than, as Deller puts it, \u201cthe standard BBC Four documentary where it\u2019s middle-aged men talking with their record collections behind them, then some unattributed archive and a voiceover\u201d, it\u2019s structured more interestingly \u2013 as you would hope from a Turner prize-winning artist such as Deller. Not only is the archive footage carefully sourced to avoid the familiar and presented in longer chunks than usual \u2013 \u201ca minute or two at a time, so you can delve into it, absorb it, take it seriously, get lost in it, almost\u201d \u2013 it is framed as a lecture by Deller, delivered to a class of A-level politics students, whose often bemused reactions are as important as the material presented. Looking partially through the eyes of people born in 2002 and 2003 really makes 1989 look like another world. There is clearly something in the air right now. The film comes as the Sweet Harmony exhibition (named, like Everybody in the Place, after an XL Records rave hit) is running at the Saatchi gallery in London, while the buzz is still high on Brian Welsh\u2019s independent movie Beats, a delightfully touching \u201cuniversal story of friendship, rebellion and the irresistible power of gathered youth\u201d set around the Scottish rave scene in 1994. At a recent Q&amp;A with Welsh following a screening of his film, it was striking how much the audience was dominated by people who were not born when the film is set \u2013 and their fascination with the details of the rave movement was palpable. Meanwhile, Radio 1 playlists are full of records by contemporary artists such as Chase &amp; Status and High Contrast, who hark back to early 90s moments of rave intensity. Why this sudden interest? \u201cNow and the 80s,\u201d says Deller, \u201care both eras that are quite rightwing, reactionary moments in British history, and music and popular culture are good ways to explore people\u2019s reactions to that.\u201d Even around the 2008 economic crash, he thinks, when 20 years of acid house could have been a significant milestone, \u201cI don\u2019t think we knew what we were in for\u201d. It is only now, after nearly 10 years of coalition/Tory rule, that the conditions a decade of Thatcherism fomented seem grimly familiar. \u201cAlso,\u201d Deller says, \u201cI think it\u2019s the media. For a very long time during and after, people didn\u2019t take the movement seriously. The media was still obsessed with punk and rock music, with that Bob Dylan sense that everything had to have \u2018meaningful\u2019 lyrics. And then with Britpop, which was for the most part reactionary, comforting and familiar. Electronic music hasn\u2019t been given the credit it deserved in terms of forcing social change and being a driver of change and youth culture.\u201d Not that rave was a utopia \u2013 and the film doesn\u2019t paint it as such. On one hand, Deller is indeed fascinated with the grassroots, \u201cself-organising\u201d movement as a site of a weird, psychedelic kind of social cohesion. \u201cI wanted to show how a rave in Blackburn that was a couple of quid on the door was different from a rave by the M25 that cost loads and had these huge lasers and so on,\u201d he says. \u201cThese clubs were meccas in towns, they were places people made pilgrimages to. The Eclipse in Coventry, Hangar 13 in Ayr, Shelley\u2019s in Stoke, these were legendary places, but every town had a hub like this, even if it was a really small dive kind of place, where you could access this music and culture.\u201d But on the other, he recognises the capitalist hustle of it, hence his focus on Paul Staines \u2013 then the publicist for uber-yuppie acid house \u201cMr Big\u201d Tony Colston-Hayter, now the mastermind behind scurrilous hard-right gossip site Guido Fawkes. The presence of Staines, Colston-Hayter (now in jail for digital financial fraud) and plenty of conservative and/or capitalist-minded people who grew up to be like his Brexit party-badged critic, was, reckons Deller, inevitable. \u201cIf something is really exciting, is the new thing, everyone\u2019s going to get involved.\u201d But he is clear that many of these people helped drive rave\u2019s futurism. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising,\u201d he says, \u201cthat Staines and Colston-Hayter met at a video game competition in the 80s.

Investigative reporter Joanne Faryon spent two years trying to find out who Garage really is, but, as she says, that\u2019s the easy part.

      "bodyText": "Talking points Comedian Sara Pascoe is launching a new podcast looking at the knotty relationships between sex and wealth. Named after her new book, the Sex Power Money podcast will feature interviews with sex workers, health experts and those involved in the porn industry to tackle subjects seen as traditionally taboo. Perhaps it\u2019s because she\u2019s a rare, universally-beloved figure in these polarising times, but there seems to be much interest in Dolly Parton at present. Ahead of a terrific-sounding Netflix anthology drama based on the characters in her songs, the nine-part podcast, Dolly Parton\u2019s America, will look at the country singer\u2019s role as the United States\u2019 \u201cgreat unifier\u201d. It will be presented by Radiolab\u2019s Jad Abumrad and launches in the autumn. Picks of the week Tell It This new storytelling podcast from BBC Radio 1 promises a glut of topical human tales from across the UK. The next episodes, due early next month, focus on gay conversion therapy in Northern Ireland, hosted by podcasters A Gay and A NonGay. Before then, there\u2019s a three-parter on how the \u201cvery wholesome\u201d amateur wrestling community helped Connor from Grimsby cope with mental health issues, and the challenges he faced when partner Cole came face to face with a steel chair. Hannah J Davies Room 20 \u201cWhat if no one knew who you were \u2026 \u201d \u2013 cue mysterious music \u2013 \u201c \u2026 and you had lost the ability to tell them?\u201d And so begins the story of \u201cSixty Six Garage\u201d, the mystery man who was left unconscious after a crash near the Mexican border. Investigative reporter Joanne Faryon spent two years trying to find out who Garage really is, but, as she says, that\u2019s the easy part. This is by the team who made Dirty John, so you can expect a good story, but Faryon also raises questions around how to treat unresponsive patients. Hannah Verdier Guardian Pick: Chips with Everything The opening story in this week\u2019s Chips with Everything is one of the more surprising covered on the show. A family have been selling a very lifelike doll of one of their children - \u2018Baby Jace\u2019. The real Jace is the young son of successful YouTubers, The Inghams, who have documented their lives \u2013 and those of their four children \u2013 online, in what some call \u201csharenting\u201d. The internet may offer more autonomy and freedom to children to document their own lives than ever before, says author Kate Eichhorn in her new book The End of Forgetting. But, as she tells presenter Jordan Erica Webber, the flipside of a childhood lived online is the possible legal ramifications for parents in the future if their children choose to sue them for oversharing without their consent. Eichhorn offers an essential consideration of the rights of the child in the internet age. Katherine Godfrey Producer pick: Nocturne Chosen by Olivia Davies \u201cPeering into the dusty corners of the night,\u201d as the tagline of KCRW\u2019s Nocturne podcast tells us, host and producer Vanessa Lowe opens our ears to the plethora of experiences we miss after the sun goes down. Atmospheric and intriguing, Nocturne takes its listeners on a sonic journey into the overlooked and under-explored side of life that takes place under the cover of darkness. At the top of each episode, you\u2019re pulled into the night \u2013 crickets chirp and owls hoot \u2013 a reminder that life keeps ticking after the glow of twilight fades away. No two episodes are the same and its blended form of storytelling strikes a beautiful balance between audio documentary and sound art. C No matter what time of day you listen, Nocturne is the perfect guide to the loneliest hours of the night.",

Ticket costs for the three-day event range from $599 for a \u201cReagan VIP pass\u201d, which gives attendees access to a speakers\u2019 room and VIP lunches, an \u201cIron Lady general pass\u201d for $349, and a \u201cMenzies three-day pass\u201d for $149. Cooper has told Guardian Australia organisers plan to run the event for \u201cmany, many years down the track \u2026 [and] have a vision for this that has thousands and thousands of attendees, not hundreds and hundreds\u201d. Labor expended much political energy attacking the conference and its attendees in the final week of parliament, but failed to shame the Morrison government into cancelling the visas of any of its speakers. The leader of the government in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, delivered a strong rebuke of Kassam\u2019s comments but defended the right of government members to attend CPAC on the basis this \u201cdoes not imply agreement or endorsement with the views of any of the other speakers attending in any way\u201d. Cormann said \u201cthe way to defeat bad ideas, bad arguments and unacceptable views is through debate, especially with those we disagree with\u201d. \u201cIt is not by limiting our conversations only to those who at all times share all of our views.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Ois\u00edn Fagan\u2019s first novel is a dark and bloody tale, well leavened with bone-dry humour, and with a dramatic climax that has about it the flavour of a Jacobean tragedy (or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/mar/23/akira-kurosawa-100-google-doodle-anniversary\" title=\"\">Kurosawa</a>, for the more cinematically inclined). The medieval Ireland in which the book is set was a complicated and contending mix of native Irish, or Gaels; long-settled English, many of Norman origin; and more recent English settlers. The novel\u2019s action occurs in the summer of 1348, the year the Black Death came to Ireland, causing destruction and chaos to sweep through the island, most of all in the central area of the English occupation. And at that area\u2019s northern edge, in County Meath, is the village of Nobber.</p> <p>Sir Osprey de Flunkl, a 17-year-old Anglo-Norman nobleman with his eye on posterity, is adventuring through this devastation acquiring vast properties, by means mostly foul. Travelling with him is his retinue of William of Roscrea, a translator between Irish and English, and Harold de Tuite, their gear carrier: both have moral doubts about the whole enterprise. There is also a boy assistant, Saint John, who consumes \u201can entire troop of mushrooms\u201d of the psilocybinous kind, and spends the better part of the novel out of his mind. They soon meet a quartet of Gaels, who throw a large number of presumably plaguey rats in their direction. At the boundary of the village, the group stop before a cruciform of wood, taller than a person, densely strung and nailed with crows, and crowned with a peasant\u2019s cap. The crows, they discover to their horror and disgust, are alive. Harold thinks they have arrived in hell.</p> <p>Nobber is indeed an infernal place. Sheriff, mayor and priest are all dead or have fled, and following a primal act of violence by the villagers, it has been taken over by a sinister, mostly absent figure, Charles de Fonteroy, and his deputy, a nameless man who sometimes goes by the pseudonym \u201cBig Cat\u201d and summarises his own moral view in the words \u201cIf God is away, the devil is not.\u201d They are assisted by the village\u2019s deranged farrier, Colca, who has been married to Alannah, a Gael, in a failed attempt to cure his sexual longing for animals. Through threats and violence, Colca imposes a curfew that leaves the villagers imprisoned in their homes, many of them dying of the plague. He drags away the bodies of the dead and grinds their bones into meal to trade with the Gaels, who use it to enhance fertility. De Flunkl arrives to do a deal to acquire yet more property just as the village reaches a point of crisis, and the Gaels close in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's written in a heightened English that eschews the larding on of historical detail, creating a world as real and unreal as our own</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given the bloody and desire-torn material at his disposal, Fagan could have drawn on the tropes and language of the rich and varied Irish gothic tradition, with its dependency on supernatural events and moods.

Through precise, vivid language, both vertiginous and beautifully controlled, it creates a world as real, and unreal, as our own, which exists in a dark, deracinating dialogue with ours, now and as it might be in the future.

Whenever I look for a new place to live, there must be a surfeit of shelving or the space to create it. The books come to me in various ways: as gifts, as new hardbacks from independent bookshops, as last-minute airport paperbacks, sent to the office by publishers (thank you), Amazon deals (I don\u2019t think any of us are innocent of that). My favourites are secondhand editions.</p> <p>A Life is a good way to describe it; books have lives. No two people read a book in the same way \u2013 each of us brings our experience to bear on a text. The exciting thing about a secondhand book is that one knows at least one other person has done precisely that.

      "bodyText": "Something I will always, always remember because, even at age 15 or so, it brought me such joy, was when I bought on eBay a first edition of Sylvia Plath\u2019s Crossing The Water collection (of course I did), and stuck to the page of the poem A Life was a squished dead fly. I own a lot of books. Whenever I look for a new place to live, there must be a surfeit of shelving or the space to create it. The books come to me in various ways: as gifts, as new hardbacks from independent bookshops, as last-minute airport paperbacks, sent to the office by publishers (thank you), Amazon deals (I don\u2019t think any of us are innocent of that). My favourites are secondhand editions. A Life is a good way to describe it; books have lives. No two people read a book in the same way \u2013 each of us brings our experience to bear on a text. The exciting thing about a secondhand book is that one knows at least one other person has done precisely that. While we might not have insight into how exactly that played out, we do have a glimpse into the book\u2019s journey. So many clues, each book a sort of Sherlock Holmes case to crack. A handwritten message to a lover in the inside fold (what ensued?) The notes of a GCSE student getting to grips with their set text. (Did they pass? Their bored jottings suggest not.)

You feel guilty. I get it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a great opener; not so much close to the bone as gnawing on it in a leotard. Plus we get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/geena-davis\">Geena Davis</a> (although never enough of her) as ex-showgirl-turned-entertainment-director Sandy Devereaux St Clair. She can usually be found wafting around the Fan-Tan casino in a leopard print outfit, dripping comedy gold about the good old Vegas days, and proffering free drinks when the chips are down. Which in GLOW, beneath the legwarmers, they usually are.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQaCxIJX0J0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xQaCxIJX0J0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQaCxIJX0J0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Watch the trailer for series three of GLOW</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This season is markedly different in content rather than tone, while dialling up the camp and, more seriously, queer volume to Liberace levels in the move from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Overall, GLOW is now an issues-led ensemble piece. Relationships, race, the private calamity of being closeted, eating disorders, immigrant trauma, trying to conceive, working mothers\u2019 guilt, and, always, sexism and misogyny, have become the focus instead of the backdrop. This means there is less wrestling, which might bother some fans, but I prefer the off-stage drama. Also Sam, who was gloriously awful as the angry, washed-up, sexist cokehead B-movie director for two seasons is now way too nice. And sober. He\u2019s not even gambling \u2026 in Vegas!</p> <p>This is all down to Ruth\u2019s good-nerd influence, and the sexual tension between them \u2013 which has always been believable but never seemed OK \u2013 reaches an awkward climax this season, in \u2013 where else? \u2013 a hot tub. Brie remains the best thing about GLOW, with her tenacity, smarts and ability to pull off a topless scene that is radical, sweet and hilarious, and gleefully dispenses with the male gaze. In one sublime moment, she and Debbie, who continue to muddle along as best friends who love to hate each other, mimic Barbra Streisand singing His Love Makes Me Beautiful in Funny Girl. In scenes like this, GLOW can still light up the room, and the heart, like no other series of its kind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/04/womens-wrestling-newly-popular-inspired-by-glow\">Feminist warriors: why wrestling for women is taking hold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fundamentally, however, it remains as discombobulating a watch as ever. Its gleeful, outrageous, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/23/summer-tv-women-bechdel-test-glow-claws\">Bechdel-test smashing tone</a> may be perfectly suited to our times but \u2013 and I say this as a brown girl who grew up in the 1980s \u2013 we simply did not talk like that about racism, sexism, homophobia and, well, our feelings back then. And it is a high-wire act to invite your audience to revel in the gender and racial stereotypes you purport to be interrogating. The risk, always, is that you end up perpetuating them. GLOW does both, usually at the same time, and there is \u2013 as the characters know all too well \u2013 a cost. Sometimes I salute its slipperiness. Sometimes I feel ready for the lights to go down.</p>",

She can usually be found wafting around the Fan-Tan casino in a leopard print outfit, dripping comedy gold about the good old Vegas days, and proffering free drinks when the chips are down. Which in GLOW, beneath the legwarmers, they usually are. This season is markedly different in content rather than tone, while dialling up the camp and, more seriously, queer volume to Liberace levels in the move from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Overall, GLOW is now an issues-led ensemble piece. Relationships, race, the private calamity of being closeted, eating disorders, immigrant trauma, trying to conceive, working mothers\u2019 guilt, and, always, sexism and misogyny, have become the focus instead of the backdrop. This means there is less wrestling, which might bother some fans, but I prefer the off-stage drama. Also Sam, who was gloriously awful as the angry, washed-up, sexist cokehead B-movie director for two seasons is now way too nice. And sober. He\u2019s not even gambling \u2026 in Vegas! This is all down to Ruth\u2019s good-nerd influence, and the sexual tension between them \u2013 which has always been believable but never seemed OK \u2013 reaches an awkward climax this season, in \u2013 where else? \u2013 a hot tub. Brie remains the best thing about GLOW, with her tenacity, smarts and ability to pull off a topless scene that is radical, sweet and hilarious, and gleefully dispenses with the male gaze. In one sublime moment, she and Debbie, who continue to muddle along as best friends who love to hate each other, mimic Barbra Streisand singing His Love Makes Me Beautiful in Funny Girl. In scenes like this, GLOW can still light up the room, and the heart, like no other series of its kind. Fundamentally, however, it remains as discombobulating a watch as ever. Its gleeful, outrageous, and Bechdel-test smashing tone may be perfectly suited to our times but \u2013 and I say this as a brown girl who grew up in the 1980s \u2013 we simply did not talk like that about racism, sexism, homophobia and, well, our feelings back then. And it is a high-wire act to invite your audience to revel in the gender and racial stereotypes you purport to be interrogating. The risk, always, is that you end up perpetuating them. GLOW does both, usually at the same time, and there is \u2013 as the characters know all too well \u2013 a cost. Sometimes I salute its slipperiness. Sometimes I feel ready for the lights to go down.",

The rock face comes closer and the switchbacks get faster until at last we pull up outside Les Grandes Alpes apartments, and my green-faced son flings open the car door to be copiously sick. I bet this wasn\u2019t how Roger Moore announced his arrival in the Alps. Still, we\u2019re here, after a 17-hour journey by train and car, and it feels good to stand breathing fresh mountain air and craning our necks at the snow-capped peaks of the Aravis massif.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2019-08-07T14:46:40.html\" data-alt=\"La Clusaz\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2019-08-07T14:46:40.html\">La Clusaz</a> </figure>  <p>La Clusaz is a small ski resort in the French Alps, close to the Swiss border, but though lots of champion skiers grew up in these valleys, winter sports are only half the tourism story for the Haute Savoie d\u00e9partment. We\u2019re here in August, and La Clusaz, with its toy-town bell tower, chalets and bright sunshine, has none of the shut-up feel of an out-of-season resort. At this time of year, the cable cars haul hikers and mountain bikers up the slopes instead of skiers.</p> <p>Sure, there\u2019s a cosy feel to the wood-panelled restaurants with their red gingham curtains and hearty menus, but who needs skiing when there are so many other ways to throw yourself down a mountain? Ebike, zipwire and the boys\u2019 (twins, aged nine) favourite: the <em>luge d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9</em> (summer toboggan, \u20ac4.90). For one afternoon we run a giddy loop, riding the cable car to 800 metres above the village, lining up for our metal sledge, rattling down the fast run with our knees around our ears, and then legging it back to the cable car to do it all over again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ce44b02949e86725ed1382f2384837dda3db453\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ce44b02949e86725ed1382f2384837dda3db453/0_302_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twin peaks \u2026 Liese Spencer\u2019s nine-year-old sons ride the cable car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twin peaks \u2026 Liese Spencer\u2019s nine-year-old sons ride the cable car</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liese Spence</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our apartment is comfortable and modern.

Watching the golden brown <em>abondance</em> cows methodically lining their stomachs with prime Alpine grass, it\u2019s easy to forget that these gentle animals are big business. Their milk is made into the much prized reblochon cheese, which, like champagne, has as <em>appellation d\u2019origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e </em>(AOC).

Interviews with children and leaked documents from Amazon\u2019s Chinese supplier, Foxconn, show that some youngsters have been asked to work nights and overtime in the factory in Hengyang in breach of Chinese labour laws. The children have been drafted in from local schools and classed as \u201cinterns\u201d, with teachers paid to accompany them to work and pressurise their pupils to take on extra work in return for improved employment prospects at the factory. One pupil said she worked up to 10 hours a day in sweltering conditions. \u201cI had no choice, I could only endure this,\u201d she says. According to company documents, Foxconn pays \u201cinterns\u201d a basic wage of \u00a31.18 an hour. Alexa devices start from around \u00a350 for a basic Echo Dot model.</p> \n<p>When confronted by the documents, Foxconn admitted employing children to work overtime and nights. The company, which also makes iPhones for Apple, said it had taken \u201cimmediate action to fix the situation\u201d.

Coppola also ruminates on the chasm that separates the new Hollywood from the famously chaotic filming of Apocalypse (\u201c\u2026Dennis Hopper, God knows what he was doing), but says that young film-makers are still taking risks. \u201cWe\u2019re in a blossoming of cinema art, I feel. It\u2019s just that they do it with their parent\u2019s credit cards.\u201d Sport J\u00fcrgen Klopp believes Liverpool will improve this season without new signings and 98 points may not be required to win the Premier League given increased competition among the leading pack. A ban on tackling above the waist is to be trialled in a radical attempt to make rugby union a safer sport. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have rejoined the ATP players\u2019 council, an intriguing twist to the power struggle at the top of the men\u2019s game. And the American gymnast, Simone Biles, was in tears as she spoke about the anger and disappointment she feels about the handling of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal. Business There\u2019s more drama for the once-untouchable City fund manager Neil Woodford as Hargreaves Lansdown waived \u00a32m in fees for nearly 300,000 customers locked in his suspended flagship fund. And Burford Capital, which Woodford is a large investor, has accused a US hedge fund of making \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d claims that have wiped more than \u00a31bn off its value, and warned the accusations could amount to market manipulation. In the US, Uber lost $5bn in the last three months, its worst ever quarterly loss, sending its shares down by 10%. The company claims its big investment programme will bear fruit in coming years but investors are nervous. Future trading suggests the FTSE100 will open flat this morning. The pound is buying $1.213 and \u20ac1.084. The papers Johnson\u2019s plan to entice top scientists to the UK leads on the i: \u201cPM scraps migrant cap to lure top scientists\u201d but the Times carries a warning from a leading British scientist on the announcement: \u201cDon\u2019t take us for fools, top scientist warns PM\u201d. The Telegraph reports on: \u201cJohnson\u2019s election spending spree\u201d and the Express carries the story of another spending pledge: \u201cBoris blitz on violent thugs\u201d. The Guardian has a warning from the opposition leader: \u201cCorbyn: Johnson plotting abuse of power to force no-deal Brexit\u201d. The Sun reports on a wounded officer who overpowered an attacker, despite having been stabbed in the head: \u201cBritain\u2019s hardest copper\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Before he built the world\u2019s greatest playground and transformed the world of children\u2019s design, Eric McMillan had<strong> </strong>spent little time thinking about how kids played. In 1971, the 29-year-old English immigrant was a design consultant living in Toronto, Canada \u2013 a sleepy city whose nickname \u201cToronto the Good\u201d both referenced the place\u2019s lingering Victorian moral rectitude and seemed to set a hard ceiling on its expectations for greatness. It would never be Toronto the exceptional, and the locals seemed content with that.</p> <p>McMillan\u2019s job was to design an exhibition for a massive new waterfront park called Ontario Place, whose somewhat unpromising theme was the glorious past and thrilling future of the province of Ontario. The architect Eberhard Zeidler had created a series of artificial islands and \u201cpods\u201d that stuck out of the water of Lake Ontario, skewered by columns like olives in a martini. The question of what to do with these architectural wonders, however, seemed to come second. \u201cNow we had to think up a great idea for what to do with our island,\u201d wrote Zeidler in his autobiography, Building Cities Life. \u201cWe thought we might have a nature reserve on them, but this was a short-lived dream because the wild animals could easily escape.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d0dc9a9a6c213eca5b810b8fa04ef141c9ef6aee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0dc9a9a6c213eca5b810b8fa04ef141c9ef6aee/15_15_1020_677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children\u2019s Village at Ontario Place, Toronto, in 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children\u2019s Village at Ontario Place, Toronto, in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: City of Toronto Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the park opened in summer 1971, while visitors were awed by the park\u2019s self-flushing toilets and Imax movies, one oversight quickly became clear: there wasn\u2019t enough for kids to do. When the park decided to remedy that by building an area devoted to children for the following year, its director, James Ramsay, turned to McMillan.</p> <p>The designer was lanky and outspoken, a wild-eyed Englishman with the accent and mannerisms of one of Monty Python\u2019s more unhinged characters. He\u2019d been responsible for the park\u2019s most successful exhibition that year \u2013 a multimedia tour through the province\u2019s history called Explosions \u2013 but he\u2019d never built anything for children. During a meeting with Ramsay, McMillan remembers his boss asking for his opinion on the park. McMillan didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI think it\u2019s boring,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, what would you do?\u201d asked Ramsay. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said McMillan. \u201cGive me two weeks.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/aug/19/from-ball-pits-to-water-slides-the-designer-who-changed-childrens-playgrounds-for-ever-podcast\">From ball pits to water slides: the designer who changed children\u2019s playgrounds for ever \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McMillan huddled with his assistant, David Lloyd, and when they returned it was with a series of sketches for a playscape unlike any seen before.

The first one in North America was a simple pile of sand in Boston\u2019s north end, installed in 1885 by female philanthropists who wanted to give poor immigrant children a place to play and, crucially, a means to assimilate to American society. That push and pull, between providing children with autonomy and controlling them, has been at the heart of playground design ever since. They are places to expand children\u2019s imaginations while constraining their physical bodies. \u201cPlaygrounds are places made by adults, for children, always with the hope of harnessing their play to a specific location,\u201d writes Alexandra Lange in her book The Design of Childhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"825cf8119ef8da9e8fc0f24b8fa9f471b6085b6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/825cf8119ef8da9e8fc0f24b8fa9f471b6085b6e/123_324_2956_3696/800.jpg\" alt=\"Eric McMillan at Children\u2019s Village in 1973.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric McMillan at Children\u2019s Village in 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dick Loek/Toronto Star/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In theme parks, where the prerequisites of play meet the demands of capitalism, the balance between stimulating a child\u2019s creativity and keeping them in control becomes more wobbly. Parks in the Disneyland mould are, above all, about managing the play of children, moving them along efficiently, safely and profitably. The equipment is to be used in a specific way, with no latitude for experimentation. The modern theme park seems to apportion its share of imagination in a perverse way, offering boundless creativity to its designers while leaving little scope for the children themselves.</p> <p>McMillan wasn\u2019t interested in controlling kids. In designing Children\u2019s Village, his driving philosophy was simple: \u201cWhat would I, as a child, like to do?\u201d But his conception of what a child might like to do was shaped by a childhood so full of Dickensian deprivation and casual violence that the idea of transplanting that experience to quiet 1970s Toronto is impossible to imagine.</p> <p>In McMillan\u2019s account of his life \u2013 a mixture of fact and family mythology that is difficult to untangle \u2013 he was stillborn during the bombing of Sheffield during the second world war and revived by a nurse, and from there life only got harder. \u201cLots of violence, lots of drinking, lots of poverty,\u201d is his summary.</p> <p>As a child, McMillan was often hungry and nearly always dirty. For a time, his family lived in the shadow of the Manchester prison called Strangeways. They were desperate enough that, one cold winter, his uncle and father broke into the prison to steal coal. He was constantly moving from rooming house to rooming house, school to school. His father was a day labourer, when he had work. On weekends, he would put on his one good suit and play piano in local pubs, earning as much in a single night as he would in a week, before drinking it all away.</p> <p>The other side of a childhood of neglect is absolute freedom. \u201cMy early memories were just being like a dog, let out in the mornings and let in at night,\u201d says McMillan. In those early years, he would play in the rubble of bombed-out buildings, clambering over the ruins, playing violent games with bricks, building paper airplanes out of the pages of discarded books. There were no restraints, no control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2eb28de52c1dca38ddfb4f9f744ab57ec7c575f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eb28de52c1dca38ddfb4f9f744ab57ec7c575f2/254_756_2030_2049/991.jpg\" alt=\"One of Eric McMillan\u2019s playground concepts\" width=\"991\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Eric McMillan\u2019s playground concepts</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Eric McMillan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he left school at 15, he could barely read or write and his hygiene habits were highly questionable. \u201cHave you seen when the live crabs at the market are trying to crawl out of their crates? You\u2019ll observe that the ones in the back are pulling back the ones that are trying to escape,\u201d says McMillan. \u201cThat\u2019s basically where I grew up.\u201d</p> <p>He got a job as a painter\u2019s apprentice and prepared for a life as a labourer. The trade school was attached to an art school, however, and as he slowly began to talk with the neighbouring students, members of a social class he had never really encountered, the idea of applying there himself became fixed in his mind. He took the exams, got in and immediately entered a new world. When he graduated a few years later, it was with growing confidence and an enormous chip on his shoulder. After designing exhibitions in England, he saw ads looking for a designer for Expo 67 in Montreal and made his way across the Atlantic.</p> <p>On his <a href=\"http://ericmcmillandesigner.net/\" title=\"\">personal website</a>, McMillan tells the story of how he escaped his upbringing with a characteristic mix of arrogance and deadpan understatement: \u201cI became an apprentice house painter, and then moved up to art school and then I became a genius and moved to North America.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I\u2019ve known Eric McMillan since I was a child. My father, another English immigrant who found himself in Canada in the 1970s, was also on the original Ontario Place team, and the two quickly became friends. I remember him striding into our house \u2013 a wild presence, all jutting elbows and knees, who would appear out of nowhere with a trunk full of plastic balls or a truckload of couch-sized interlocking plastic blocks, prototypes for a new experiment in fort-building.</p> <p>At Children\u2019s Village, McMillan was left to himself with a $700,000 budget. Prickly and protective over his vision, he demanded full control. \u201cI think I have the reputation of telling more ministers and deputy ministers to fuck off than anyone else,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The time in which he was working was a remarkably fertile one for children\u2019s design. In the postwar era, with the baby boom, there were suddenly new economies around childhood. \u201cIt led to tremendous innovation,\u201d says Alexandra Lange. With government and institutional support, designers felt free to experiment. \u201cPeople at the highest echelon of design were interested in childhood,\u201d says Lange. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a subset, it was at the centre of design.\u201d</p> <p>This was the era in which \u201cjunk playgrounds\u201d or \u201cadventure playgrounds\u201d \u2013 places where tiny children were given tool belts and fistfuls of nails and left to build their own forts \u2013 proliferated across the continent. It was an era in which designers emerging from the 60s, full of dreams about building political and social utopias, took their visions to the local parks, building abstract sculptures and modernist experiments that children could clamber over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"317bff95bdf4ee2ae7cb15cdc37c024a780ee8c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/317bff95bdf4ee2ae7cb15cdc37c024a780ee8c6/0_428_2489_3109/801.jpg\" alt=\"Children\u2019s Village in 1975.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children\u2019s Village in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Bezant/Toronto Star/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Children\u2019s Village, McMillan built two and a half acres of mayhem under an orange canopy \u2013 reproducing in the safety of Toronto his feral childhood spent scrabbling through rubble, with mountains of colourful vinyl and foam. He erected an enormous spider web structure that hung from soaring watchtowers. He built a series of wooden ladders that spun on their axes, hurling would-be climbers to the mats below. He strung swinging monkey bars over a pool of water and suspended a forest of punching bags at the centre of the village that was, for decades, the most reliable producer of bloody noses in Toronto.</p> <p>When the park opened in July 1972, it immediately became the city\u2019s capital of kids\u2019 play. \u201cI had never seen anything like it,\u201d remembers Irina Ceric, now a professor in British Columbia. \u201cIt was entirely designed just for kids in a way that other parks weren\u2019t. It was the best thing that I had ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>In my memory, the overriding feeling of entering Children\u2019s Village was an exhilarating, perhaps even slightly scary freedom. The world under the iconic orange canopy was capacious enough that you always felt as if there were undiscovered corners \u2013 a child-sized hamster wheel beneath a small hill, a new rope bridge from one of the watchtowers you\u2019d never taken. Here, at last, was a place that had been built specifically for you and then left to your dominion. There were no parents to help you in the chaos of the punching bags. Exactly how you chose to scramble your brain while flinging yourself between the giant vertical rubber bands was your business. The place was yours. It was your village.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Children\u2019s Village was a hit. Families flocked to it and international media praised it, with Time calling it \u201cone of the most imaginative playgrounds in the world\u201d. The next year, the Ontario Place brass gave McMillan control over another section of the park and he set to work creating a water play area, with lagoons and climbing equipment amid rushing water.</p> <p>Building before the first water parks or splash pads, McMillan created his attractions from scratch, gathering a team of prop builders, metal workers and craftspeople to manufacture the enormous squirting faces controlled by pumps and bicycle-powered water guns he dreamed up. One of the early visitors to McMillan\u2019s park was an American named George Millay. Today Millay is credited as the father of the water park, the progenitor of a massive industry. When Millay opened the first Wet \u2019n Wild in Orlando in 1977, however, the name he gave the children\u2019s area was a tip of the cap to his inspiration: Canadian Water Caper.</p> <p>With his success at Ontario Place, McMillan became a major figure in the blossoming world of children\u2019s design. \u201cSuddenly I became the world\u2019s expert on child\u2019s play,\u201d says McMillan. People were calling him the next Walt Disney and the \u201cfather of soft play\u201d for his use of vinyl-clad foam. Over the next decade he designed playgrounds in various SeaWorlds in America and amusement parks in France. He built a park in a mall in Chicago and was shuttled out to Alabama and asked to transform 3,000 acres into a science park. In 1980, McMillan teamed up with Jim Henson\u2019s Children\u2019s Television Workshop to create Sesame Place, the first of a planned series of tactile amusement parks to be built across America with the aim of helping children \u201clearn through play\u201d.</p> <p>It was a decade of remarkable creativity. McMillan remembers sitting around with Lloyd one day and looking at a glass jar of pickled onions. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be something to be able to roll around in there?\u201d he thought. They set about ordering masses of light plastic balls for a \u201cball crawl\u201d in San Diego \u2013 the world\u2019s first ball pit, an invention that soon became ubiquitous in McDonald\u2019s and Ikeas across the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"390dec486e1063ceed83568304009628923c3a8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/390dec486e1063ceed83568304009628923c3a8d/0_0_2778_1932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children\u2019s Village in 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children\u2019s Village in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dick Loek/Toronto Star/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seemed to McMillan as if he was working in virgin territory, designing places for kids with a seriousness of purpose he hadn\u2019t seen before. Watching children use his equipment, often in ways he could never have anticipated, made him more and more certain: play wasn\u2019t a frivolous distraction from learning, but something essential to childhood and indeed humanity. The line-up-and-go-on-an-iron-ride model of the theme park was defunct. The key was to build things that sparked interaction, between kids and the equipment, but especially between the kids themselves. According to his design philosophy, each park wasn\u2019t just a place to jump on a shockingly large air mattress. It was \u201ca place where a child can ask questions of what it means to be human\u201d.</p> <p>McMillan formed his own design company, determined to build his own series of parks his way. \u201cAfter Sesame Place, I was getting really arrogant, really confident,\u201d he says. \u201cI had sites. I had Montreal, I had Sacramento. I was going to build and operate my own parks and show them how it would be done.</p> <p>\u201cI got crazy, mate. I was going to change the world. I was going to change American culture and therefore the world. I was sure I was going to do it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, the world changed without him. The skills required to fund and run a theme park, of course, are very different from the creativity needed to design one. Spoiled by the free rein he had been given at Ontario Place, he often chafed at the demands and restrictions of his corporate partners. One project fell through, then another. McMillan grew tired with throwing himself into designs only to watch them collapse for reasons beyond his control. \u201cEric could project a very pure kind of childlike play,\u201d says Henry Piersig, a German-born prop builder who was one of McMillan\u2019s collaborators. \u201cBut maybe eventually he ran out of steam.\u201d</p> <p>More than that, the times had changed. If the design for children in the 60s and 70s had been full of possibility and experimentation, the prevailing mood in the 1980s was of caution. \u201cIn the 80s, there was this real turn towards a safety culture,\u201d says Lange. \u201cWe tamped down on a lot of innovation and a lot of the risk and reward of the children\u2019s environment.\u201d After a series of lawsuits against playgrounds, \u201cliability\u201d, not \u201ccreativity\u201d, became the most important word in children\u2019s design. The adventure playgrounds that once dotted North America were shuttered. The massive wooden jungle gyms in schoolyards were replaced with modest climbing structures.</p> <p>With its bright colours and unruly design, Children\u2019s Village became a relic on the lakeshore \u2013 a vision of the future from the near past. \u201cIt feels like it was meant to be the beginning of something,\u201d says Ceric. \u201cBut it ended up ending there.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Children\u2019s Village was closed in 2002. The rest of Ontario Place shut down in 2011. Recently, though, I\u2019ve seen more and more of my peers reflecting nostalgically about the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/37tga0/the_gloriously_unsafe_majesty_of_ontario_place/\" title=\"\">gloriously unsafe majesty</a>\u201d of Children\u2019s Village. The park is a lost part of childhood for a whole cohort of Torontonians. It feels like a strange dream. Were the towers really so high? Did the ziplines really run so fast?</p> <p>Nowhere is more infused with nostalgia than the places you played in as a child. Looking back on the playgrounds of the past, however, is more than mere sentimentality, and it isn\u2019t just specific to people who remember Children\u2019s Village. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the air,\u201d says Alexandra Lange. \u201cWe understand that children\u2019s play environment has been impoverished. And so looking back at those times when it wasn\u2019t so impoverished feels really important.\u201d Today, as the kids who grew up running through the punching bag forest are having children of their own, it\u2019s impossible not to think that Children\u2019s Village represented a brief moment when a different style of mass play was possible. Instead of an amusement park in which kids line up for hours to sit passively on a moving piece of intellectual property, what if a park just provided the raw materials for child-instigated, slightly dangerous adventure?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e40c505ae1cd082ce7b932be76af573f0ba1e745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e40c505ae1cd082ce7b932be76af573f0ba1e745/376_270_3548_2128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A modern-day water park in Ayia Napa, Cyprus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A modern-day water park in Ayia Napa, Cyprus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: parasola.net/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This summer, the provincial government is accepting proposals for new developments on the Ontario Place grounds. In the years since it closed, there have been plans for a year-round water park, for a casino, for an enormous ferris wheel. There have been calls to relocate the Science Centre to the waterfront or turn the entire thing into a public park.</p> <p>No one\u2019s asked Eric McMillan what should be on the site of the former kids\u2019 utopia he built on the waterfront. Now 77, he lives with his wife, Rose, in the Quebec countryside. He has an orange tree he likes to visit. He and Rose hand-grind their own coffee, build stone walls, snowshoe up the hills in the winter. The place is their own personal playground. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a more privileged existence,\u201d he says. He hasn\u2019t visited the grounds himself in years. \u201cOntario Place long ago became a very sad ruin of what could have been an interesting place,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Still, McMillan can\u2019t seem to stop himself from thinking about it. Recently, he came up with his own proposal for the site. In his reimagining, the empty pods have been transformed into massive lake filters \u2013 sucking up the water from Lake Ontario, cleaning it, and then sending it cascading into the lake below. The design takes Zeidler\u2019s buildings and turns them into massive pieces of interactive art, where kids can help control the flow of water. The plan is whimsical and audacious, as outside-the-box and indifferent to the demands of commerce as ever. When I ask him what else should be done with the Ontario Place pods, he answers immediately. \u201cThey just can rip them down and turn them into scrap metal and build condos along the edge,\u201d says McMillan. \u201cOr \u2026 they can go really crazy.\u201d</p> <p><em>A version of this piece first appeared in <a href=\"https://thelocal.to/childrens-village-forever/\" title=\"\">the Local</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Before he built the world\u2019s greatest playground and transformed the world of children\u2019s design, Eric McMillan had spent little time thinking about how kids played. In 1971, the 29-year-old English immigrant was a design consultant living in Toronto, Canada \u2013 a sleepy city whose nickname \u201cToronto the Good\u201d both referenced the place\u2019s lingering Victorian moral rectitude and seemed to set a hard ceiling on its expectations for greatness. It would never be Toronto the exceptional, and the locals seemed content with that. McMillan\u2019s job was to design an exhibition for a massive new waterfront park called Ontario Place, whose somewhat unpromising theme was the glorious past and thrilling future of the province of Ontario. The architect Eberhard Zeidler had created a series of artificial islands and \u201cpods\u201d that stuck out of the water of Lake Ontario, skewered by columns like olives in a martini. The question of what to do with these architectural wonders, however, seemed to come second. \u201cNow we had to think up a great idea for what to do with our island,\u201d wrote Zeidler in his autobiography, Building Cities Life. \u201cWe thought we might have a nature reserve on them, but this was a short-lived dream because the wild animals could easily escape.\u201d When the park opened in summer 1971, while visitors were awed by the park\u2019s self-flushing toilets and Imax movies, one oversight quickly became clear: there wasn\u2019t enough for kids to do. When the park decided to remedy that by building an area devoted to children for the following year, its director, James Ramsay, turned to McMillan. The designer was lanky and outspoken, a wild-eyed Englishman with the accent and mannerisms of one of Monty Python\u2019s more unhinged characters. He\u2019d been responsible for the park\u2019s most successful exhibition that year \u2013 a multimedia tour through the province\u2019s history called Explosions \u2013 but he\u2019d never built anything for children. During a meeting with Ramsay, McMillan remembers his boss asking for his opinion on the park. McMillan didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI think it\u2019s boring,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, what would you do?\u201d asked Ramsay. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said McMillan. \u201cGive me two weeks.\u201d McMillan huddled with his assistant, David Lloyd, and when they returned it was with a series of sketches for a playscape unlike any seen before. Children\u2019s Village would be a massive success. It would launch McMillan\u2019s career. It would sit at the centre of kid-life for a generation of Torontonians and, briefly, promise to revolutionise the way the world plays. \u201cI thought it was just another job,\u201d says McMillan today. Ramsay thought differently. \u201cHe told me: \u2018This is going to make you famous.\u2019\u201d * * * The playground is a curious creation. The first one in North America was a simple pile of sand in Boston\u2019s north end, installed in 1885 by female philanthropists who wanted to give poor immigrant children a place to play and, crucially, a means to assimilate to American society. That push and pull, between providing children with autonomy and controlling them, has been at the heart of playground design ever since. They are places to expand children\u2019s imaginations while constraining their physical bodies. \u201cPlaygrounds are places made by adults, for children, always with the hope of harnessing their play to a specific location,\u201d writes Alexandra Lange in her book The Design of Childhood. In theme parks, where the prerequisites of play meet the demands of capitalism, the balance between stimulating a child\u2019s creativity and keeping them in control becomes more wobbly. Parks in the Disneyland mould are, above all, about managing the play of children, moving them along efficiently, safely and profitably. The equipment is to be used in a specific way, with no latitude for experimentation. The modern theme park seems to apportion its share of imagination in a perverse way, offering boundless creativity to its designers while leaving little scope for the children themselves. McMillan wasn\u2019t interested in controlling kids. In designing Children\u2019s Village, his driving philosophy was simple: \u201cWhat would I, as a child, like to do?\u201d But his conception of what a child might like to do was shaped by a childhood so full of Dickensian deprivation and casual violence that the idea of transplanting that experience to quiet 1970s Toronto is impossible to imagine. In McMillan\u2019s account of his life \u2013 a mixture of fact and family mythology that is difficult to untangle \u2013 he was stillborn during the bombing of Sheffield during the second world war and revived by a nurse, and from there life only got harder. \u201cLots of violence, lots of drinking, lots of poverty,\u201d is his summary. As a child, McMillan was often hungry and nearly always dirty. For a time, his family lived in the shadow of the Manchester prison called Strangeways. They were desperate enough that, one cold winter, his uncle and father broke into the prison to steal coal. He was constantly moving from rooming house to rooming house, school to school. His father was a day labourer, when he had work. On weekends, he would put on his one good suit and play piano in local pubs, earning as much in a single night as he would in a week, before drinking it all away. The other side of a childhood of neglect is absolute freedom. \u201cMy early memories were just being like a dog, let out in the mornings and let in at night,\u201d says McMillan. In those early years, he would play in the rubble of bombed-out buildings, clambering over the ruins, playing violent games with bricks, building paper airplanes out of the pages of discarded books. There were no restraints, no control. When he left school at 15, he could barely read or write and his hygiene habits were highly questionable. \u201cHave you seen when the live crabs at the market are trying to crawl out of their crates? You\u2019ll observe that the ones in the back are pulling back the ones that are trying to escape,\u201d says McMillan. \u201cThat\u2019s basically where I grew up.\u201d He got a job as a painter\u2019s apprentice and prepared for a life as a labourer. The trade school was attached to an art school, however, and as he slowly began to talk with the neighbouring students, members of a social class he had never really encountered, the idea of applying there himself became fixed in his mind. He took the exams, got in and immediately entered a new world. When he graduated a few years later, it was with growing confidence and an enormous chip on his shoulder. After designing exhibitions in England, he saw ads looking for a designer for Expo 67 in Montreal and made his way across the Atlantic. On his personal website, McMillan tells the story of how he escaped his upbringing with a characteristic mix of arrogance and deadpan understatement: \u201cI became an apprentice house painter, and then moved up to art school and then I became a genius and moved to North America.\u201d * * * I\u2019ve known Eric McMillan since I was a child. My father, another English immigrant who found himself in Canada in the 1970s, was also on the original Ontario Place team, and the two quickly became friends. I remember him striding into our house \u2013 a wild presence, all jutting elbows and knees, who would appear out of nowhere with a trunk full of plastic balls or a truckload of couch-sized interlocking plastic blocks, prototypes for a new experiment in fort-building. At Children\u2019s Village, McMillan was left to himself with a $700,000 budget. Prickly and protective over his vision, he demanded full control. \u201cI think I have the reputation of telling more ministers and deputy ministers to fuck off than anyone else,\u201d he says. The time in which he was working was a remarkably fertile one for children\u2019s design. In the postwar era, with the baby boom, there were suddenly new economies around childhood. \u201cIt led to tremendous innovation,\u201d says Alexandra Lange. With government and institutional support, designers felt free to experiment. \u201cPeople at the highest echelon of design were interested in childhood,\u201d says Lange. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a subset, it was at the centre of design.\u201d This was the era in which \u201cjunk playgrounds\u201d or \u201cadventure playgrounds\u201d \u2013 places where tiny children were given tool belts and fistfuls of nails and left to build their own forts \u2013 proliferated across the continent. It was an era in which designers emerging from the 60s, full of dreams about building political and social utopias, took their visions to the local parks, building abstract sculptures and modernist experiments that children could clamber over. At Children\u2019s Village, McMillan built two and a half acres of mayhem under an orange canopy \u2013 reproducing in the safety of Toronto his feral childhood spent scrabbling through rubble, with mountains of colourful vinyl and foam. He erected an enormous spider web structure that hung from soaring watchtowers. He built a series of wooden ladders that spun on their axes, hurling would-be climbers to the mats below. He strung swinging monkey bars over a pool of water and suspended a forest of punching bags at the centre of the village that was, for decades, the most reliable producer of bloody noses in Toronto. When the park opened in July 1972, it immediately became the city\u2019s capital of kids\u2019 play. \u201cI had never seen anything like it,\u201d remembers Irina Ceric, now a professor in British Columbia. \u201cIt was entirely designed just for kids in a way that other parks weren\u2019t. It was the best thing that I had ever seen.\u201d In my memory, the overriding feeling of entering Children\u2019s Village was an exhilarating, perhaps even slightly scary freedom. The world under the iconic orange canopy was capacious enough that you always felt as if there were undiscovered corners \u2013 a child-sized hamster wheel beneath a small hill, a new rope bridge from one of the watchtowers you\u2019d never taken. Here, at last, was a place that had been built specifically for you and then left to your dominion. There were no parents to help you in the chaos of the punching bags. Exactly how you chose to scramble your brain while flinging yourself between the giant vertical rubber bands was your business. The place was yours. It was your village. * * * Children\u2019s Village was a hit. Families flocked to it and international media praised it, with Time calling it \u201cone of the most imaginative playgrounds in the world\u201d. The next year, the Ontario Place brass gave McMillan control over another section of the park and he set to work creating a water play area, with lagoons and climbing equipment amid rushing water. Building before the first water parks or splash pads, McMillan created his attractions from scratch, gathering a team of prop builders, metal workers and craftspeople to manufacture the enormous squirting faces controlled by pumps and bicycle-powered water guns he dreamed up. One of the early visitors to McMillan\u2019s park was an American named George Millay. Today Millay is credited as the father of the water park, the progenitor of a massive industry. When Millay opened the first Wet \u2019n Wild in Orlando in 1977, however, the name he gave the children\u2019s area was a tip of the cap to his inspiration: Canadian Water Caper. With his success at Ontario Place, McMillan became a major figure in the blossoming world of children\u2019s design. \u201cSuddenly I became the world\u2019s expert on child\u2019s play,\u201d says McMillan. People were calling him the next Walt Disney and the \u201cfather of soft play\u201d for his use of vinyl-clad foam. Over the next decade he designed playgrounds in various SeaWorlds in America and amusement parks in France. He built a park in a mall in Chicago and was shuttled out to Alabama and asked to transform 3,000 acres into a science park. In 1980, McMillan teamed up with Jim Henson\u2019s Children\u2019s Television Workshop to create Sesame Place, the first of a planned series of tactile amusement parks to be built across America with the aim of helping children \u201clearn through play\u201d. It was a decade of remarkable creativity. McMillan remembers sitting around with Lloyd one day and looking at a glass jar of pickled onions. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be something to be able to roll around in there?\u201d he thought. They set about ordering masses of light plastic balls for a \u201cball crawl\u201d in San Diego \u2013 the world\u2019s first ball pit, an invention that soon became ubiquitous in McDonald\u2019s and Ikeas across the world. It seemed to McMillan as if he was working in virgin territory, designing places for kids with a seriousness of purpose he hadn\u2019t seen before. Watching children use his equipment, often in ways he could never have anticipated, made him more and more certain: play wasn\u2019t a frivolous distraction from learning, but something essential to childhood and indeed humanity. The line-up-and-go-on-an-iron-ride model of the theme park was defunct. The key was to build things that sparked interaction, between kids and the equipment, but especially between the kids themselves. According to his design philosophy, each park wasn\u2019t just a place to jump on a shockingly large air mattress. It was \u201ca place where a child can ask questions of what it means to be human\u201d. McMillan formed his own design company, determined to build his own series of parks his way. \u201cAfter Sesame Place, I was getting really arrogant, really confident,\u201d he says. \u201cI had sites. I had Montreal, I had Sacramento. I was going to build and operate my own parks and show them how it would be done. \u201cI got crazy, mate. I was going to change the world. I was going to change American culture and therefore the world. I was sure I was going to do it.\u201d Instead, the world changed without him. The skills required to fund and run a theme park, of course, are very different from the creativity needed to design one. Spoiled by the free rein he had been given at Ontario Place, he often chafed at the demands and restrictions of his corporate partners. One project fell through, then another. McMillan grew tired with throwing himself into designs only to watch them collapse for reasons beyond his control. \u201cEric could project a very pure kind of childlike play,\u201d says Henry Piersig, a German-born prop builder who was one of McMillan\u2019s collaborators. \u201cBut maybe eventually he ran out of steam.\u201d More than that, the times had changed. If the design for children in the 60s and 70s had been full of possibility and experimentation, the prevailing mood in the 1980s was of caution. \u201cIn the 80s, there was this real turn towards a safety culture,\u201d says Lange. \u201cWe tamped down on a lot of innovation and a lot of the risk and reward of the children\u2019s environment.\u201d After a series of lawsuits against playgrounds, \u201cliability\u201d, not \u201ccreativity\u201d, became the most important word in children\u2019s design. The adventure playgrounds that once dotted North America were shuttered. The massive wooden jungle gyms in schoolyards were replaced with modest climbing structures. With its bright colours and unruly design, Children\u2019s Village became a relic on the lakeshore \u2013 a vision of the future from the near past. \u201cIt feels like it was meant to be the beginning of something,\u201d says Ceric. \u201cBut it ended up ending there.\u201d * * * Children\u2019s Village was closed in 2002. The rest of Ontario Place shut down in 2011. Recently, though, I\u2019ve seen more and more of my peers reflecting nostalgically about the \u201cgloriously unsafe majesty\u201d of Children\u2019s Village. The park is a lost part of childhood for a whole cohort of Torontonians. It feels like a strange dream. Were the towers really so high? Did the ziplines really run so fast? Nowhere is more infused with nostalgia than the places you played in as a child. Looking back on the playgrounds of the past, however, is more than mere sentimentality, and it isn\u2019t just specific to people who remember Children\u2019s Village. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the air,\u201d says Alexandra Lange. \u201cWe understand that children\u2019s play environment has been impoverished. And so looking back at those times when it wasn\u2019t so impoverished feels really important.\u201d Today, as the kids who grew up running through the punching bag forest are having children of their own, it\u2019s impossible not to think that Children\u2019s Village represented a brief moment when a different style of mass play was possible. Instead of an amusement park in which kids line up for hours to sit passively on a moving piece of intellectual property, what if a park just provided the raw materials for child-instigated, slightly dangerous adventure? This summer, the provincial government is accepting proposals for new developments on the Ontario Place grounds. In the years since it closed, there have been plans for a year-round water park, for a casino, for an enormous ferris wheel. There have been calls to relocate the Science Centre to the waterfront or turn the entire thing into a public park. No one\u2019s asked Eric McMillan what should be on the site of the former kids\u2019 utopia he built on the waterfront. Now 77, he lives with his wife, Rose, in the Quebec countryside. He has an orange tree he likes to visit. He and Rose hand-grind their own coffee, build stone walls, snowshoe up the hills in the winter. The place is their own personal playground. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a more privileged existence,\u201d he says. He hasn\u2019t visited the grounds himself in years. \u201cOntario Place long ago became a very sad ruin of what could have been an interesting place,\u201d he says. Still, McMillan can\u2019t seem to stop himself from thinking about it. Recently, he came up with his own proposal for the site. In his reimagining, the empty pods have been transformed into massive lake filters \u2013 sucking up the water from Lake Ontario, cleaning it, and then sending it cascading into the lake below. The design takes Zeidler\u2019s buildings and turns them into massive pieces of interactive art, where kids can help control the flow of water. The plan is whimsical and audacious, as outside-the-box and indifferent to the demands of commerce as ever. When I ask him what else should be done with the Ontario Place pods, he answers immediately. \u201cThey just can rip them down and turn them into scrap metal and build condos along the edge,\u201d says McMillan. \u201cOr \u2026 they can go really crazy.\u201d A version of this piece first appeared in the Local \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

But voters are more concerned with national identity, pride, self-reliance and local accountability. Scotland has the same population as Denmark, with much the same resources, infrastructure and talent. Once it was richer by far. Today its GDP per person is \u00a333,000 against Denmark\u2019s $63,000 (\u00a352,000). I am sure the slide lies in Scotland\u2019s long economic dependency on the UK. Denmark would no more think of re-entering its former union with Norway than of leaving the EU. It enjoys small-state autonomy, and clearly prospers from it. It is a rich, happy country. Sooner or later, London will be forced to grow up and recognise that it has sacrificed the right to rule the British Isles. Ireland has gone and Scotland will clearly go one day. Whitehall should take the initiative and prepare a fiscal and legislative independence package; one that withdraws Scots MPs from Westminster and sees Scotland rejoin the EU, but keeps travel, currency and citizenship ties in place. If Johnson really does stick to no deal \u2013 or its bastard sibling, hard Brexit \u2013 he will drive Scotland to separation. Like it or not, this means borders. To the absurdity of inspection posts in Fermanagh and Tyrone will be added posts in Berwick and Carlisle. Johnson will then have to tell the Queen that she must be just Queen of England \u2013 and perhaps Wales. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2019. An earlier version gave Scotland\u2019s GDP per person as $33,000. That should have been \u00a333,000.",

He has now cut back about 14 minutes to finally arrive at his ideal, which he argues is the strongest elucidation yet of the film\u2019s examination of human morality. \u201cI really feel that this version of Apocalypse Now achieves more of what that theme has to give than any of the previous versions,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>The film transposes Joseph Conrad\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jul/29/journeys-in-literature-heart-of-darkness-by-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">Heart of Darkness</a> on to the conflict in Vietnam, and Coppola rewrote and reworked John Milius\u2019s original script so that it would be more faithful to the book. \u201cYou have to realise, when I was making this I didn\u2019t carry a script around,\u201d he says. \u201cI carried a green Penguin paperback copy of Heart of Darkness with all my underlining in it. I made the movie from that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The result is a savage and darkly comic examination of the absurdity and double standards of war. Early in the film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/24/robert-duvall-oscars-wild-horses-western-interview\" title=\"\">Robert Duvall</a>\u2019s Lt Col Kilgore \u2013 who is in the midst of a helicopter attack against an innocent village, and will soon order a napalm strike \u2013 witnesses a Vietnamese woman toss a grenade into one of his choppers. \u201cSavages,\u201d he spits.

It shouldn\u2019t have sequences of violence that inspire a lust for violence. Apocalypse Now has stirring scenes of helicopters attacking innocent people. That\u2019s not anti-war.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2019/may/30/the-horror-apocalypse-now-unseen-in-pictures\">The horror! Apocalypse Now unseen \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He pitches his own alternative, by way of counter example: \u201cI always thought the perfect anti-war film would be a story in Iraq about a family who were going to have their daughter be married, and different relatives were going to come to the wedding. The people manage to come, maybe there\u2019d be some dangers, but no one would get blown up, nobody would get hurt. They would dance at the wedding. That would be an anti-war film. An anti-war film cannot glorify war, and Apocalypse Now arguably does. Certain sequences have been used to rev up people to be warlike.\u201d</p> \n<p>I ask him if he feels any guilt. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel guilty, because I know my role in the whole process.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7490e1922862a0d12644d921e6af5d08e5510dce\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7490e1922862a0d12644d921e6af5d08e5510dce/0_158_3328_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On set with Robert Duvall, mounted in his helicopter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On set with Robert Duvall, mounted in his helicopter.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Apocalypse Now\u2019s ill-starred 238 days shooting in the Philippines have become the stuff of film-making legend, much of it captured in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/01/george-hickenlooper-obituary\" title=\"\">Hearts of Darkness, George Hickenlooper\u2019s documentary</a> about the making of the film pieced together from behind-the-scenes footage shot by Coppola\u2019s wife Eleanor. The movie\u2019s travails were legion. Coppola dropped his leading man, Harvey Keitel, a couple of weeks into shooting, only for his replacement, Martin Sheen, to have a near-fatal heart attack. A typhoon destroyed much of the set. Coppola had an epileptic seizure. The helicopters he had rented from the Philippine government repeatedly disappeared off to go to take part in actual combat, fighting an insurgency in the south of the country. The pilots were rarely the same from rehearsal to rehearsal and the choppers had to be repainted twice a day to change their colours from American back to Filipino. When Brando turned up on set he was overweight and underprepared. He insisted his character should be called Col Leighley, and Harrison Ford shot scenes referring to him by that name which had to be redubbed later on when Brando belatedly came around to the name Kurtz.</p> \n<p>None of this was helped by reportedly prodigious drug use among the film\u2019s cast and crew, with Dennis Hopper apparently asking for \u201cabout an ounce of cocaine\u201d in exchange for taking on his role. Coppola, however, says he personally steered clear of that kind of debauchery. \u201cI never took drugs at all in my life, except for some grass,\u201d he says. \u201cI found that the effect that grass would have on me was interesting because it made me extremely focused. Also, if I smoked a joint I couldn\u2019t fall asleep. I would want to work, and then I would stay up all night to rewrite the script. I\u2019ve had cocaine but I found it very unpleasant. It\u2019s too much. In terms of Dennis Hopper, God knows what he was doing.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a9c4d2aaca5ffd5b0b0bc3670b698b62b1258d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a9c4d2aaca5ffd5b0b0bc3670b698b62b1258d0/0_172_3570_2142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shooting the helicopter attack on location in the Philippines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Death from above: shooting the helicopter attack on location in the Philippines.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dirck Halstead/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>No matter how often the production lurched from one crisis to another, Coppola consistently resisted the temptation to release a film that didn\u2019t meet his own exacting standards. \u201cThat definitely is not Francis\u2019s MO,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/26/makingvideo.editing\" title=\"\">Walter Murch</a>, the Oscar-winning sound designer who also edited much of the film. \u201cThere are people under those circumstances, when something is going badly, who try to retreat to a safe place. This only encouraged Francis to go even further. Always, when presented with the option of A or B, if B was riskier yet offered the potential for something really unique, he would go for that. It was breathtaking at times, both in production and post-production.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dc98f5a78e9f193d3aa1c23be5b80beb0267042b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc98f5a78e9f193d3aa1c23be5b80beb0267042b/780_0_3543_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coppola with Dennis Hopper\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coppola with Dennis Hopper: \u2018God knows what he was doing.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caterine Milinaire/Sygma via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is highly doubtful that any major production would be allowed to take such risks today. Coppola argues that, as well as the technological advances that have transformed movie-making since the 70s, power has tilted in the direction of studios and away from directors. \u201cThere\u2019s not only control with the extraordinary things you can do in \u2026 it shouldn\u2019t even be called post-production. It is all production,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, also, the studios during the period of the 70s learned how to prevent runaway directors. I mean the famous experience with United Artists and Michael Cimino\u2019s film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/19/cleopatra-heavens-gate-last-hollywood-stinkers\" title=\"\">Heaven\u2019s Gate</a> so traumatised companies that they developed techniques to prevent that type of runaway-director behaviour which we, in my generation, sort of exploited.\u201d The perfectionist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/feb/23/1\" title=\"\">Cimino</a>\u2019s slow-moving, hugely expensive and enormously long western flopped so badly it bankrupted the studio.</p> \n<p>At the end of Hearts of Darkness, Coppola states his belief that: \u201cOne day, some little fat girl in Ohio is gonna be the new Mozart and make a beautiful film with her little father\u2019s camcorder, and for once the so-called professionalism about movies will be destroyed for ever and it will become an art form.\u201d Now that most of the population carries a digital video camera about their person at all times, I ask if Coppola still believes the proliferation of cheaper video equipment will transform Hollywood.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe story of Hollywood has to do with who owns it,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the old days, it was owned by these characters like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/12/samuel-goldwyn-jr\" title=\"\">Sam Goldwyn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/16/times-finally-up-for-hollywoods-lolita-complex\" title=\"\">Darryl Zanuck</a> and Jack Warner, who were just as vulgar and abusive as Harvey Weinstein. Maybe not Sam Goldwyn and a few others. I don\u2019t pardon it, it was terrible how they were, but the difference was that the owners loved movies. Today, the owners of the film business are very many steps removed. They\u2019re pretty much telecom companies who borrowed an enormous amount of money to be able to buy Universal or CBS, so all they care about is servicing their loan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"367f15614db8924c5499f31068c3ab7ee6e46ee8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/367f15614db8924c5499f31068c3ab7ee6e46ee8/0_232_3280_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Sheen as Capt Benjamin Willard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the heart of darkness: Martin Sheen as Capt Benjamin Willard.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zoetrope/United Artists/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhere the little girl from Ohio is relevant is that now we have this double film industry,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe have the studio pictures, which we know are really the same movie over and over and over again, and then there\u2019s this very fertile independent film business, which are all the kids I was referring to. That\u2019s the cinema. The cinema is not the industrial cinema. The cinema is independent cinema. Even this second golden age of television comes from people who wanted to make films like we did in the 70s but weren\u2019t permitted to, so they did it for television. We\u2019re in a blossoming of cinema art, I feel. It\u2019s just that they do it with their parent\u2019s credit cards.\u201d</p> \n<p>The fact that Apocalypse Now retains its power to shock and awe four decades on is testament to Coppola\u2019s determination to do it his way. That meant risking everything, but today he can look out over Inglenook and know he rolled the dice and won. \u201cI never let not knowing how to do something stop me from trying to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cI always got myself into those situations because it was exciting and I got to do all these wonderful, nutty things. Is the point of life just to live some normal, calm, moderately happy existence? I mean, you only get it once.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Apocalypse Now: Final Cut is released on 13 August in the UK and 16 August in the US.

Later on, Marlon Brando\u2019s Col Kurtz observes: \u201cWe train young men to drop fire on people, but their commanders won\u2019t allow them to write \u2018fuck\u2019 on their airplanes because it\u2019s obscene.\u201d It is to my surprise, then, that Coppola hesitates to call the film \u201canti-war\u201d. \u201cNo one wants to make a pro-war film, everyone wants to make an anti-war film,\u201d he says. \u201cBut an anti-war film, I always thought, should be like [Kon Ichikawa\u2019s 1956 post-second world war drama] The Burmese Harp \u2013 something filled with love and peace and tranquillity and happiness. It shouldn\u2019t have sequences of violence that inspire a lust for violence. Apocalypse Now has stirring scenes of helicopters attacking innocent people. That\u2019s not anti-war.\u201d He pitches his own alternative, by way of counter example: \u201cI always thought the perfect anti-war film would be a story in Iraq about a family who were going to have their daughter be married, and different relatives were going to come to the wedding. The people manage to come, maybe there\u2019d be some dangers, but no one would get blown up, nobody would get hurt. They would dance at the wedding. That would be an anti-war film. An anti-war film cannot glorify war, and Apocalypse Now arguably does. Certain sequences have been used to rev up people to be warlike.\u201d I ask him if he feels any guilt. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel guilty, because I know my role in the whole process.\u201d Apocalypse Now\u2019s ill-starred 238 days shooting in the Philippines have become the stuff of film-making legend, much of it captured in Hearts of Darkness, George Hickenlooper\u2019s documentary about the making of the film pieced together from behind-the-scenes footage shot by Coppola\u2019s wife Eleanor. The movie\u2019s travails were legion. Coppola dropped his leading man, Harvey Keitel, a couple of weeks into shooting, only for his replacement, Martin Sheen, to have a near-fatal heart attack. A typhoon destroyed much of the set. Coppola had an epileptic seizure. The helicopters he had rented from the Philippine government repeatedly disappeared off to go to take part in actual combat, fighting an insurgency in the south of the country. The pilots were rarely the same from rehearsal to rehearsal and the choppers had to be repainted twice a day to change their colours from American back to Filipino. When Brando turned up on set he was overweight and underprepared. He insisted his character should be called Col Leighley, and Harrison Ford shot scenes referring to him by that name which had to be redubbed later on when Brando belatedly came around to the name Kurtz. None of this was helped by reportedly prodigious drug use among the film\u2019s cast and crew, with Dennis Hopper apparently asking for \u201cabout an ounce of cocaine\u201d in exchange for taking on his role. Coppola, however, says he personally steered clear of that kind of debauchery. \u201cI never took drugs at all in my life, except for some grass,\u201d he says. \u201cI found that the effect that grass would have on me was interesting because it made me extremely focused. Also, if I smoked a joint I couldn\u2019t fall asleep. I would want to work, and then I would stay up all night to rewrite the script. I\u2019ve had cocaine but I found it very unpleasant. It\u2019s too much. In terms of Dennis Hopper, God knows what he was doing.\u201d No matter how often the production lurched from one crisis to another, Coppola consistently resisted the temptation to release a film that didn\u2019t meet his own exacting standards. \u201cThat definitely is not Francis\u2019s MO,\u201d says Walter Murch, the Oscar-winning sound designer who also edited much of the film. \u201cThere are people under those circumstances, when something is going badly, who try to retreat to a safe place. This only encouraged Francis to go even further. Always, when presented with the option of A or B, if B was riskier yet offered the potential for something really unique, he would go for that. It was breathtaking at times, both in production and post-production.\u201d It is highly doubtful that any major production would be allowed to take such risks today. Coppola argues that, as well as the technological advances that have transformed movie-making since the 70s, power has tilted in the direction of studios and away from directors. \u201cThere\u2019s not only control with the extraordinary things you can do in \u2026 it shouldn\u2019t even be called post-production. It is all production,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, also, the studios during the period of the 70s learned how to prevent runaway directors. I mean the famous experience with United Artists and Michael Cimino\u2019s film Heaven\u2019s Gate so traumatised companies that they developed techniques to prevent that type of runaway-director behaviour which we, in my generation, sort of exploited.\u201d The perfectionist Cimino\u2019s slow-moving, hugely expensive and enormously long western flopped so badly it bankrupted the studio. At the end of Hearts of Darkness, Coppola states his belief that: \u201cOne day, some little fat girl in Ohio is gonna be the new Mozart and make a beautiful film with her little father\u2019s camcorder, and for once the so-called professionalism about movies will be destroyed for ever and it will become an art form.\u201d Now that most of the population carries a digital video camera about their person at all times, I ask if Coppola still believes the proliferation of cheaper video equipment will transform Hollywood. \u201cThe story of Hollywood has to do with who owns it,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the old days, it was owned by these characters like Sam Goldwyn, Darryl Zanuck and Jack Warner, who were just as vulgar and abusive as Harvey Weinstein. Maybe not Sam Goldwyn and a few others. I don\u2019t pardon it, it was terrible how they were, but the difference was that the owners loved movies. Today, the owners of the film business are very many steps removed. They\u2019re pretty much telecom companies who borrowed an enormous amount of money to be able to buy Universal or CBS, so all they care about is servicing their loan. \u201cWhere the little girl from Ohio is relevant is that now we have this double film industry,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe have the studio pictures, which we know are really the same movie over and over and over again, and then there\u2019s this very fertile independent film business, which are all the kids I was referring to. That\u2019s the cinema. The cinema is not the industrial cinema. The cinema is independent cinema. Even this second golden age of television comes from people who wanted to make films like we did in the 70s but weren\u2019t permitted to, so they did it for television. We\u2019re in a blossoming of cinema art, I feel. It\u2019s just that they do it with their parent\u2019s credit cards.\u201d The fact that Apocalypse Now retains its power to shock and awe four decades on is testament to Coppola\u2019s determination to do it his way. That meant risking everything, but today he can look out over Inglenook and know he rolled the dice and won. \u201cI never let not knowing how to do something stop me from trying to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cI always got myself into those situations because it was exciting and I got to do all these wonderful, nutty things. Is the point of life just to live some normal, calm, moderately happy existence? I mean, you only get it once.\u201d \u2022 Apocalypse Now: Final Cut is released on 13 August in the UK and 16 August in the US. A special screening in selected cinemas, for one night only on 13 August, features a filmed conversation with Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Soderbergh. The film is released on home entertainment on 16 September",

      "body": "<p>Why does the United States refuse to pass new gun control laws? It\u2019s the question that people around the world keep asking. </p> <p>According to Dr Jonathan Metzl, a psychiatrist and sociologist at Vanderbilt University, white supremacy is the key to understanding America\u2019s gun debate. In his new book, <a href=\"https://www.dyingofwhiteness.com/\">Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment is Killing America\u2019s Heartland</a>, Metzl argues that the intensity and polarization of the<strong> </strong>US<strong> </strong>gun debate makes much more sense when understood in the context of whiteness and white privilege.<strong> </strong></p> <p>White Americans\u2019 attempt to defend their status in the racial hierarchy by opposing issues like gun control, healthcare expansion or public school funding ends up injuring themselves, as well as hurting people of color, Metzl argues.</p> <p>The majority of America\u2019s gun death victims are white men, and most of them die from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. In all, gun suicide claims the lives of 25,000 Americans each year.</p> <p>White Americans are \u201cdying for a cause\u201d, he writes, even if their form of death is often \u201cslow, excruciating, and invisible\u201d.</p> <p>Metzl spoke to the Guardian about his analysis this March, and again this week, following what appeared to be a white nationalist terror attack on Latino families doing back-to-school shopping at a Walmart in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/07/people-are-afraid-to-be-hispanic-trump-set-to-visit-an-angry-and-fearful-el-paso\">El Paso, Texas</a>, that left 22 people dead. The conversations have been condensed and edited.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/07/white-supremacist-terrorism-intelligence-analyst\">'Blood on their hands': the intelligence officer whose warning over white supremacy was ignored</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>You argue that America\u2019s debate over gun control laws and gun violence makes a lot more sense</strong><strong> if you actually understand it as a debate over race and whiteness in America. Why is that?</strong></p> <p>In my research I look at the history and the social meanings of how guns came to be these particularly charged social symbols. So many aspects of American gun culture are really entwined with whiteness and white privilege.</p> <p>Carrying a gun in public has been coded as a white privilege. Advertisers have literally used words like \u201crestoring your manly privilege\u201d as a way of selling assault weapons to white men. In colonial America, landowners could carry guns, and they bestowed that right on to poor whites in order to quell uprisings from \u201cNegroes\u201d and Indians. John Brown\u2019s raid was about weapons. Scholars have written about how the Ku Klux Klan was aimed at disarming African Americans. When African Americans started to carry guns in public \u2013 think about Malcolm X during the civil rights era \u2013 all of a sudden, the second amendment didn\u2019t apply in many white Americans\u2019 minds. When Huey Newton and the Black Panthers tried to arm themselves, everyone suddenly said, \u201cWe need gun control.\u201d</p> <p>When states like Missouri changed their laws to allow open carry of firearms, there were parades of white Americans who would carry big long guns through congested areas of downtown St Louis, who would go into places like Walmart and burrito restaurants carrying their guns, and they were coded as patriots. At the same time, there were all the stories about African American gun owners who would go to Walmart and get tackled and shot.</p> <p>Who gets to carry a gun in public? Who is coded as a patriot? Who is coded as a threat, or a terrorist or a gangster? What it means to carry a gun or own a gun or buy a gun \u2013 those questions are not neutral. We have 200 years of history, or more, defining that in very racial terms.</p> <p><strong>What moments in the past few years have demonstrated to you most clearly that it\u2019s impossible to understand America\u2019s gun control debate without talking about whiteness?</strong></p> <p>The period after a mass shooting is often very telling.<strong> </strong>When the shooter is white, the context is the individual narrative \u2013 this individual disordered white mind. When the shooter is black or brown, all of a sudden the disorder is culture. The narrative we tell then is about terrorism or gangs. </p> <p>Then there\u2019s the quiet everyday level. There\u2019s nothing more painful than sitting in a room with family members who have lost loved ones to suicide. I\u2019d talk to people who had lost husbands, wives, kids, parents to gun suicide, and they would come to the interview, often, bringing their guns. And I would ask them: did it change how you think about the gun? And they\u2019d argue it\u2019s never the gun\u2019s fault and they\u2019d need the gun in case an invader would attack them. This narrative about protection against the radicalized invader was so profound. They were almost nervous not bringing their guns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f175fd8ea68115a1434175d1b9fd9d047eb6a9ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f175fd8ea68115a1434175d1b9fd9d047eb6a9ec/0_0_4266_2766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gun rights supporters gather at a Guns Across America rally at the Texas state capitol in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gun rights supporters gather at a Guns Across America rally at the Texas state capitol in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it<strong> </strong>was very much coded in racial terms. A number of people I talked to in my book basically said, I\u2019m getting this gun because of Ferguson [the city where the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/11/wesley-bell-st-louis-prosecutor-ferguson\">Michael Brown</a>, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer in 2015 sparked sustained public protests led by black residents].

      "bodyText": "Why does the United States refuse to pass new gun control laws? It\u2019s the question that people around the world keep asking. According to Dr Jonathan Metzl, a psychiatrist and sociologist at Vanderbilt University, white supremacy is the key to understanding America\u2019s gun debate. In his new book, Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment is Killing America\u2019s Heartland, Metzl argues that the intensity and polarization of the US gun debate makes much more sense when understood in the context of whiteness and white privilege. White Americans\u2019 attempt to defend their status in the racial hierarchy by opposing issues like gun control, healthcare expansion or public school funding ends up injuring themselves, as well as hurting people of color, Metzl argues. The majority of America\u2019s gun death victims are white men, and most of them die from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. In all, gun suicide claims the lives of 25,000 Americans each year. White Americans are \u201cdying for a cause\u201d, he writes, even if their form of death is often \u201cslow, excruciating, and invisible\u201d. Metzl spoke to the Guardian about his analysis this March, and again this week, following what appeared to be a white nationalist terror attack on Latino families doing back-to-school shopping at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. The conversations have been condensed and edited. You argue that America\u2019s debate over gun control laws and gun violence makes a lot more sense if you actually understand it as a debate over race and whiteness in America. Why is that? In my research I look at the history and the social meanings of how guns came to be these particularly charged social symbols. So many aspects of American gun culture are really entwined with whiteness and white privilege. Carrying a gun in public has been coded as a white privilege. Advertisers have literally used words like \u201crestoring your manly privilege\u201d as a way of selling assault weapons to white men. In colonial America, landowners could carry guns, and they bestowed that right on to poor whites in order to quell uprisings from \u201cNegroes\u201d and Indians. John Brown\u2019s raid was about weapons. Scholars have written about how the Ku Klux Klan was aimed at disarming African Americans. When African Americans started to carry guns in public \u2013 think about Malcolm X during the civil rights era \u2013 all of a sudden, the second amendment didn\u2019t apply in many white Americans\u2019 minds. When Huey Newton and the Black Panthers tried to arm themselves, everyone suddenly said, \u201cWe need gun control.\u201d When states like Missouri changed their laws to allow open carry of firearms, there were parades of white Americans who would carry big long guns through congested areas of downtown St Louis, who would go into places like Walmart and burrito restaurants carrying their guns, and they were coded as patriots. At the same time, there were all the stories about African American gun owners who would go to Walmart and get tackled and shot. Who gets to carry a gun in public? Who is coded as a patriot? Who is coded as a threat, or a terrorist or a gangster? What it means to carry a gun or own a gun or buy a gun \u2013 those questions are not neutral. We have 200 years of history, or more, defining that in very racial terms. What moments in the past few years have demonstrated to you most clearly that it\u2019s impossible to understand America\u2019s gun control debate without talking about whiteness? The period after a mass shooting is often very telling. When the shooter is white, the context is the individual narrative \u2013 this individual disordered white mind. When the shooter is black or brown, all of a sudden the disorder is culture. The narrative we tell then is about terrorism or gangs. Then there\u2019s the quiet everyday level. There\u2019s nothing more painful than sitting in a room with family members who have lost loved ones to suicide. I\u2019d talk to people who had lost husbands, wives, kids, parents to gun suicide, and they would come to the interview, often, bringing their guns. And I would ask them: did it change how you think about the gun? And they\u2019d argue it\u2019s never the gun\u2019s fault and they\u2019d need the gun in case an invader would attack them. This narrative about protection against the radicalized invader was so profound. They were almost nervous not bringing their guns. And it was very much coded in racial terms. A number of people I talked to in my book basically said, I\u2019m getting this gun because of Ferguson [the city where the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer in 2015 sparked sustained public protests led by black residents]. These were people who lived 300 miles from Ferguson, in entirely white areas of rural America. When I tried to pin them down about it, they would say, \u201cThis could happen anywhere. I have to protect myself and my property.\u201d I talked to a number of people in African American communities, and for them, this meaning of guns being like a privilege was completely absent. They had very ambiguous or mixed feelings about weapons, because, for a lot of people I spoke with in St Louis they symbolized, \u201cCarry a gun, get shot by the police.\u201d Given how important you think white privilege is to understanding gun policy, should people be talking or messaging about the gun control debate differently? I\u2019m not imagining that MSNBC talking more about \u201chow guns are proof that you\u2019re racist\u201d is going to change this debate.

I didn\u2019t know him personally, but I\u2019d seen him around a lot.</p> <p>Me and my sister came down, and we saw him lying in the street. The street was taped off and the mama was crying. People were scared because of how intense it was \u2013 you know, like, people versus cops. A few police officers came down and started playing basketball with us. So that was cool.</p> <p>I do feel like that could have been me. They act as if we are wild animals and not humans. Cops need to adjust to the environment they are in, or find a job that doesn\u2019t scare them. As a black man we are even more scared now, because they can kill and get away with it. But we can\u2019t so much as talk back without being beat up, tased, or shot.</p> <p>I feel like if we could come together as a community it\u2019d be a lot better than it is now. Like, we want to blame the cops, and want to blame law enforcement, but a lot of this stuff we do to ourselves. If we can stand as one, instead of coming together because something bad happens, when someone gets killed, when we want to scream and shout.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"428ba839d9b62504409253bf708de3b273b4e93a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/428ba839d9b62504409253bf708de3b273b4e93a/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Gabriel Cornelius: \u2018They had snipers on top of the buildings, stuff like that.\u2019\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gabriel Cornelius: \u2018They had snipers on top of the buildings, stuff like that.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Whitney Curtis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Gabriel Cornelius, 14</strong></h2> <p><strong>Gabriel was working the Earth Dance Farm booth at the Ferguson farmers\u2019 market</strong></p> <p>I remember I was at the barber shop with my dad.

Stuff got burned down so we couldn\u2019t go outside. Like, most kids didn\u2019t want to walk after school like we used to.

Yeah, you got kids that do hype stuff, but Ferguson is a good place to live. Like, you can sit on your porch and watch kids go outside, run around, actually have fun instead of being in the house all day worried about stuff. Everybody knows everybody. It\u2019s very connected. We need to just get the community more as one. Like, doing more community-building things.</p> <p>This is a really nice community center. It\u2019s a dollar to get in if you\u2019re a resident. If you buy a membership, it\u2019s free to get in. It\u2019s a lot of stuff here to do.

      "bodyText": "Ricky Allen, 20 Ricky was in a green space around the corner from where he lives at the Canfield Green apartment complex, which overlooks where Michael Brown died I was down the street playing basketball with my friends. We saw news cameras. We asked somebody what happened, and they said a cop had just killed a kid. I didn\u2019t know him personally, but I\u2019d seen him around a lot. Me and my sister came down, and we saw him lying in the street. The street was taped off and the mama was crying. People were scared because of how intense it was \u2013 you know, like, people versus cops. A few police officers came down and started playing basketball with us. So that was cool. I do feel like that could have been me. They act as if we are wild animals and not humans. Cops need to adjust to the environment they are in, or find a job that doesn\u2019t scare them. As a black man we are even more scared now, because they can kill and get away with it. But we can\u2019t so much as talk back without being beat up, tased, or shot. I feel like if we could come together as a community it\u2019d be a lot better than it is now. Like, we want to blame the cops, and want to blame law enforcement, but a lot of this stuff we do to ourselves. If we can stand as one, instead of coming together because something bad happens, when someone gets killed, when we want to scream and shout. Gabriel Cornelius, 14 Gabriel was working the Earth Dance Farm booth at the Ferguson farmers\u2019 market I remember I was at the barber shop with my dad. I just got my hair cut. My dad was next, and he was sitting in the chair and he saw on Facebook like: \u201cYo, this police officer just shot a young kid and just had him sitting there for a couple of hours.\u201d I didn\u2019t really understand what was going on because I was so young. Everybody was getting upset. My grandmother called my mama to let her know they out protesting and stuff like that. The next day, we ended up going out there. At first, me and my sister was all worried. Like: \u201cMama, don\u2019t go out there. Something might happen.\u201d I remember looking on top of the firehouse and I saw a guy with a black mask. They had snipers on top of buildings, stuff like that. The farm is a nice place. I remember my first time working there, I asked chef Michael [Gallina] if I could I go to his restaurant and do a project for extra points or something like that. He said that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s cool, you can come up there any time you want. It\u2019s real nice people. I like the farm. La\u2019Revious \u2018Fresh\u2019 Woods, 13 La\u2019Revious was helping with a yard sale at the home of his grandmother, who has lived in Ferguson for over 20 years We just moved to Florissant a couple years ago, after Mike Brown. I used to live down the street here in Ferguson \u2013 I lived there since I was born. It was cool before the stuff with Mike Brown started happening. After that, everything just changed. It\u2019s not the same. Police not the same. You call them, they come real late. Say if I call them at 2.30, they\u2019ll probably come at like 3 o\u2019clock. They act like they don\u2019t care. I just threw away a sign that said: no justice, no peace. Me, my mom, my auntie, half my family went out there with signs, but nothing happened. Nobody talks about it \u2013 for real \u2013 any more. I feel bad for Mike Brown\u2019s mom and dad because nothing really happened. The police didn\u2019t get locked up. The city needs to have better police management and staff. This my grandparents\u2019 house. They support me all the time, especially with football. I\u2019m going to go pro in football and just make my family happy about what I\u2019m doing. They already are proud of me now, but I\u2019m going to make them even more proud by getting rich when I get older, playing for my favorite team, the New Orleans Saints. Joshua Donaldson, 17 Joshua was at the Ferguson community center, running solo basketball drills I remember we couldn\u2019t go to school for a couple of weeks. It started late because of the riots. When we was up at the school they talked about it a lot. Told us not to be outside and not to be throwing stuff. It was a big hype. Stuff got burned down so we couldn\u2019t go outside. Like, most kids didn\u2019t want to walk after school like we used to. Kids were scared, and their parents didn\u2019t want them walking any more, basically. It\u2019s cooled down. Everything is back together. I\u2019ve been in Ferguson since my sixth-grade year. You see kids outside playing, going to the parks. It\u2019s really peaceful in Ferguson, to be honest. It\u2019s no rioting. It\u2019s not hype or anything like that. Yeah, you got kids that do hype stuff, but Ferguson is a good place to live. Like, you can sit on your porch and watch kids go outside, run around, actually have fun instead of being in the house all day worried about stuff. Everybody knows everybody. It\u2019s very connected. We need to just get the community more as one. Like, doing more community-building things. This is a really nice community center. It\u2019s a dollar to get in if you\u2019re a resident. If you buy a membership, it\u2019s free to get in. It\u2019s a lot of stuff here to do. If a kid is bored at home he can just come up here and chill with his friends. Artez Holloway, 14 Artez and his family were loading up a truck and moving out of Ferguson into the neighboring town of Jennings for better school options When Mike Brown died, everybody was protesting. I was kind of scared so I just went to my room and lay down and went to sleep. I\u2019ve been living here nine years. When Mike Brown died I felt some type of way, \u2019cos I\u2019m kind of scared of the police. Every time I would see the police I would run. Now when I see them sometimes I just walk. I feel kind of safe with the police being here, but at the same time, I really don\u2019t. The cops can be nicer. They can play more basketball games with us. Community stuff like that.

Despite Barbados relying heavily on tourism, it has no private beaches, unlike some other Caribbean islands. Resorts can be built by the beach, but they can\u2019t stop locals from walking on them. It was a right that was fought for by the likes of the calypsonian Mighty Gabby. In the mornings, people would come to our beach and fish for a meal. I watched a man throw his net into the water at dawn and catch sardines. I discovered that I liked beaches. One day I joined the sun worshippers on the beach. I read Michelle Obama\u2019s memoirs while I roasted gently. After a few hours, I thought to myself: maybe this sun worship is not a race thing but a living in a cold climate thing. Even a Nigerian raised in Nigeria, such as myself, may become a sun worshipper after repeated exposure to British winters. On the drive back to the airport, I saw three boys. They were in uniform, probably just let out of school. They walked with a bounce, a swagger, with their elbows slightly stuck out to give their wiry frames some bulk. In another context, these carefree boys might have been viewed with suspicion: by just walking boldly and freely, taking up space on a public pavement, they might have had criminal aspersions cast on their association. But here, you could see them clearly for what they were: black boys full of joy. It was good to be in black man country. \u2022 Chibundu Onuzo is the author of The Spider King\u2019s Daughter and Welcome to Lagos",

He cited government spending on infrastructure and structural policies to expand investment, innovation and employment as other possible levers. While acknowledging there were \u201csome capacity constraints\u201d he encouraged governments to look for opportunities to invest in infrastructure, citing cheap borrowing rates, which allow Australia to borrow for 10 years at less than 2% interest. Lowe said the central bank is prepared to cut the official cash rate below 1% but that he thinks the use of unorthodox policy solutions like quantitative easing in Australia is \u201cunlikely\u201d.

      "bodyText": "One of New Zealand\u2019s largest telecommunications providers, Spark, has banned the far-right site 8chan after the country\u2019s chief censor offered his backing for any internet service provider who did so in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting. Censor David Shanks applauded Spark\u2019s \u201cbrave and meaningful\u201d decision, describing the message board as \u201cthe white supremacist killer\u2019s platform of choice\u201d. \u201cThese are extraordinary circumstances, and platforms that promote terrorist atrocities should not be tolerated on the internet, or anywhere else. Spark is making the right call here.\u201d he said. In announcing its decision, Spark said the platform was guilty of \u201crepeated transgressions\u201d and hosted \u201cdisturbing material\u201d. 8chan \u2013 on which the El Paso suspect reportedly published his screed \u2013 has been temporarily forced offline while it looks for another host. Spark said that if the website became active again its customers in New Zealand would not be able to access it. The El Paso document included expressions of support for the Christchurch gunman, whose livestreamed attack on worshippers in New Zealand in March left 51 people dead. Spark\u2019s move apparently came after Shanks said he would support any ISP that decided to ban 8chan. It said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a consistent view that the appropriate agencies of government should put in place a robust policy framework to address the important issues surrounding such material being distributed online and freely available. \u201cAs an internet service provider, we don\u2019t make these decisions lightly and want to work with Government, the wider industry and civil society organisations to make the internet a better place for New Zealanders.\u201d Spark confirmed 8Chan was the only website it will block. Shanks said he was aware that ISPs \u201cdo not want to be in the business of making judgments around the content of sites\u201d. \u201cThis is a unique set of circumstances, and relying on ISPs to make these calls is not a solution for the mid or long term. I agree with calls for a transparent, robust and sensible regulatory response. Discussions have already started on what this might look like here in NZ. Ultimately this is a global, internet problem.\u201d Following the mosque attacks in March, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has led a global effort to pressure internet providers and social media companies to eliminate terrorist and violent content online. Known as the \u201cChristchurch call\u201d, Ardern said no one had a right to livestream mass murder. \u201cWe want to maintain the principles of a free, open and secure internet, but this isn\u2019t about freedom of expression, this is about preventing violent extremism and terrorism online. I don\u2019t think anyone would argue that the terrorist on the 15th of March had a right to livestream the murder of 50 people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all need to act, and that includes social media providers taking more responsibility for the content that is on their platforms \u2026 it\u2019s critical that technology platforms like Facebook are not perverted as a tool for terrorism, and instead become part of a global solution to countering extremism.\u201d According to geopolitical and strategic risk expert Paul Buchanan, users of 8chan commented on the Christchurch live feed, urging the killer on and applauding his efforts. \u201c8chan has become a hate fest and incites violence. I was monitoring 8chan as he was killing people in the mosque. They were cheering for him, they were saying that he should shoot people twice.

It\u2019s full-on insurgent and guerrilla preparation.\u201d Following the Christchurch attack, Australian internet providers temporarily blocked access to sites hosting the shooter\u2019s video of the massacre, including 8chan and 4chan. However following the El Paso shooting, Australia\u2019s version of the chief censor said websites carrying the manifesto did not reach the benchmark for censorship. \u201cWhen issuing such a direction, the esafety commissioner assesses whether the crisis event involves terrorist or extreme violent material being disseminated online in a manner likely to cause significant harm to the Australian community,\u201d a spokesperson for Australia\u2019s esafety commissioner told the Guardian. \u201cWhile the attack in El Paso was a heinous act of terror, in exercising our discretion we have determined the manifesto does not reach this threshold.\u201d Additional reporting by Josh Taylor",

At a press conference assistant chief constable Alan Todd accused the ringleaders of using women and children as human shields, obliging police to withdraw to reduce the risk to innocent bystanders. \u201cI regrettably have had to take a decision today that the risks of continuing an operation to remove a bonfire were outweighed by the risks that operation would then pose to the wider community, the women and children, and others there present,\u201d he said. Earlier the police had accompanied contractors from a private removals company in an unsuccessful attempt to dismantle the pyre, which is emblazoned with an Irish tricolour. After the police withdrew, the bonfire went ahead on Thursday night to commemorate the anniversary of the mass internment of republican suspects in 1971, an event that galvanised IRA recruitment at the height of the Troubles. Mark Lindsay, the chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, said the \u201cmob\u201d of \u201cyoung thugs\u201d used iron fencing as well as projectiles. They were ugly scenes reminiscent of the past, he said. \u201cThey are disgraceful and unacceptable.\u201d While police and contractors hovered, several youths clambered on top of the bonfire, comprised of wooden pallets, saying they wanted to protect it. It is adjacent to blocks of flats and sits on land owned by the Department of Infrastructure. Sinn F\u00e9in said the community did not want the bonfire, calling it a health and safety hazard, and urged the youths to abandon the standoff. \u201cThe vast majority of the community have told us they do not want this bonfire,\u201d said Gerry Kelly, a former IRA bomber-turned Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member. He called the bonfire a risk to life. \u201cIt has been built by anti-social elements, who torture this district throughout the year and many of whom are well-known.\u201d Politicians from other parties also blamed the standoff on a handful of agitators believed to have links to dissident republicans. \u201cThis is a small element intent on causing havoc and they should not be allowed to continue to hold the area to ransom,\u201d said Alan Chambers, the Ulster Unionist party\u2019s policing spokesperson. Earlier this week graffiti appeared on the wall of a family centre threatening reprisals if any contractors tried to intervene. It read \u201cOur wood goes, this centre goes\u201d and \u201cContractors beware\u201d. A loyalist bonfire in east Belfast prompted a separate standoff last month. The city council ordered the bonfire removed but it went ahead after graffiti threatened the specific removals contractor with reprisals. The contractor withdrew and the bonfire went ahead.",

By late next year, Nine Entertainment will house all its staff \u2013 from Willoughby, Pyrmont and the CBD \u2013 in a 25,000 sq m office over several floors in a $1.2bn tower block at 1 Denison in North Sydney. Mini driver News Corp just loves Coles Little Shop. Not only does the marketing gimmick generate front-page advertising for the paper, but there are all sort of angles to cover. Despite criticism of the promotional tools by environmental groups and health advocates, the Herald Sun found a positive angle. Apparently the plastic minis \u2013 which have washed up on beaches \u2013 can be used as a maths lesson. States\u2019 rates News Corp Australia\u2019s news.com.au is the most popular news website in Australia, according to Nielsen, which measures the ratings. Some sharp industry observers have pointed out that news.com.au\u2019s ratings are boosted by including local readers of Murdoch\u2019s US properties NY Post, Page Six and Decider. When you land on these pages they have a news.com.au masthead. According to figures seen by Weekly Beast, this is giving them as many as 500,000 additional readers monthly. The editor-in-chief of news.com.au, Kate de Brito, says the estimate of 500,000 is significantly overstated as it does not take into account the audience duplication across the sections. \u201cYes we have a mutual traffic attribution arrangement with the NY Post which is a global affiliate publishing partner - as part of the News Corp group,\u201d de Brito said. \u201cThis mutual audience attribution agreement has been approved by both Nielsen and ComScore.\u201d",

Fallout from Hastie\u2019s remarks continued on Friday after China denounced the Liberal chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, although the Liberal MP\u2019s Australian critics have targeted his analogy rather than the substance of his warning. Cormann\u2019s rebuke marks a split in the government, with the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, riding to Hastie\u2019s defence by suggesting that many government and opposition MPs have concerns about China. In an opinion piece for Nine newspapers on Thursday, Hastie said Australia should remain \u201ctrue to our democratic convictions\u201d while balancing security and trade interests, and argued that \u201cresetting the terms of engagement with China to preserve our sovereignty\u201d was the most important goal of foreign policy. He warned that Australia had \u201cfailed to see how mobile our authoritarian neighbour has become\u201d, comparing the belief that economic liberalisation would naturally lead to democratisation in China to France\u2019s defences against Germany in the 1930s, which \u201cfailed catastrophically\u201d. On Friday Cormann, the finance minister and government leader in the Senate, told Sky News he \u201cdidn\u2019t agree with that sort of comparison\u201d and noted that Hastie had made the comments on his \u201cpersonal behalf\u201d, not on behalf of the government. \u201cI thought it was a bit clumsy and inappropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt detracts from what \u2013 broadly \u2013 is an important conversation.\u201d Cormann said Australia had a \u201cvery important\u201d strategic and economic relationship with China, but agreed that issues raised by Hastie were \u201clegitimately part of the public conversation and public debate\u201d. He said Australia aimed both to protect its sovereignty and have \u201cgood, positive, cooperative relationships with important partners around the world\u201d. Earlier Dutton said he was not concerned the comments would affect Australia\u2019s relationship with China \u201cbecause the Chinese understand the depth of the relationship\u201d. He said Hastie \u201cdeserves the respect of all people in parliament\u201d \u2013 citing his military service before entering parliament. \u201cI think he\u2019s served his country with great distinction, I think he\u2019s doing that in parliament through his work on the backbench committee and Andrew is privy to a lot of information and intelligence briefings that other members of parliament aren\u2019t. \u201cHe obviously has a very significant interest in this space \u2013 as do many members of the Labor party who I\u2019ve spoken to privately as well.\u201d Dutton said there was \u201cno sense pretending there was nothing to see here\u201d regarding concerns in the Pacific region, including foreign interference. \u201cWe need to have a mature debate \u2013 and [to] pretend there\u2019s nothing happening here \u2026 is not realistic.\u201d The former foreign minister Julie Bishop was quoted in Nine newspapers as saying: \u201cWe should be careful in drawing historic parallels, particularly when it refers to one of the darkest chapters in human history.\u201d In a statement on Thursday the Chinese embassy said it \u201cstrongly deplores\u201d Hastie\u2019s intervention \u201cwhich lays bare his Cold-War mentality and ideological bias\u201d. \u201cHistory has proven and will continue to prove that China\u2019s peaceful development is an opportunity, not a threat to the world,\u201d it said. \u201cWe urge certain Australian politicians to take off their \u2018colored lens\u2019 and view China\u2019s development path in an objective and rational way.\u201d Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, labelled Hastie\u2019s comments \u201cextraordinary \u2026 extreme, overblown and unwelcome\u201d. In the last parliament the Turnbull government passed measures to combat foreign interference \u2013 widely perceived as targeted at China \u2013 including creating new espionage offences, banning foreign political donations and creating a register of agents of foreign influence. The former prime minister Kevin Rudd once accused Malcolm Turnbull of \u201cself-indulgent nuttiness\u201d for inflaming Australia\u2019s relationship with China, while Turnbull has blamed the media for presenting a negative view of the relationship.",

      "bodyText": "Revenue at the Australian mastheads run by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp fell by 6% last year, and the company\u2019s pay TV operation, Foxtel, has also been hit by falling subscriber numbers. But results released on Friday show that overall the globe-spanning media empire returned to the black in the year to the end of June, declaring a profit of US$155m (A$228m). This followed a loss of about US$1.5bn in 2018, due mainly to News Corp taking full control of the struggling Foxtel by buying out Telstra. Across the news part of the group, advertising revenue fell and subscription revenue was flat as the company struggled against currency movements that have made its non-US businesses less lucrative. News Corp said a 3%, or US$163m, fall in revenue at its news division, which includes its papers and websites in Australia and the UK, was largely driven by declines in the Australian dollar and UK pound. Revenue at News UK, which includes the Sun and the Times, fell 4%. The mood was grimmer in the last three months of the financial year \u2013 News Corp Australia revenue slid 7% and News UK revenue was down 10%. In an effort to cut costs, News Corp made several staff across editorial and other divisions at its Australian tabloids redundant in the run-up to June 30. It did not mention the job cuts in its results announcement, but said News Corp Australia made a \u201chigher contribution\u201d to profits. \u201cAdvertising revenues declined 8% compared to the prior year, of which $18m, or 2%, was related to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations,\u201d the company told the stock exchange. \u201cThe remainder of the decline was driven by weakness in the print advertising market and lower home delivered revenues, which include free-standing insert products, at News America Marketing, partially offset by growth in digital advertising revenues.\u201d Revenue from subscription TV, which includes Foxtel and the company\u2019s new on-demand sports service Kayo, was down 13% or $342m, and about half the fall was because of currency movements. \u201cThe remainder of the revenue decline was driven by the impact from lower broadcast subscribers and changes in the subscriber package mix, partially offset by higher revenues from Foxtel Now and Kayo,\u201d News Corp said. Chief executive, Robert Thomson, said the company finished the year \u201crobustly\u201d, with global revenue up 12%. \u201cWe are acutely focused on simplifying the structure of the company and making clear the full value of the sum of our parts,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s planned sale of its US coupon business News America Marketing was \u201cprogressing well\u201d, he said.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian version of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) kicks off on Friday, continuing the long tradition here of conservative groups importing ideas, rather than generating them. This weekend\u2019s event is a branch-office version of the reliably wacky, but troublingly influential annual US conference. Among other things, CPAC is generally credited with launching Donald Trump\u2019s career as a Republican political contender, after he was invited to speak there in 2011. In the US, the conference offers a forum for hardline rightwing Republicans. Trump headlined again this year, but he was joined by YouTubers Diamond and Silk; former VP candidate Sarah Palin; anti-immigration Fox News host Laura Ingraham; high-profile evangelist Franklin Graham; and Turning Point USA honcho, Charlie Kirk. But CPAC has sometimes had trouble in deciding which speakers and which ideas cross the line, as conservatives become more open to radical right ideas on race, multiculturalism and immigration. In recent years it has invited, then disinvited, groups like the conspiracist John Birch Society, and individuals like Milo Yiannopoulos. The Australian version should make us wonder whether conservatives here, too, have trouble drawing a line around mainstream conservatism, and keeping more malevolent political currents at bay. The problem is not that all of the speakers at CPAC are beyond the pale. Clearly, whatever leftwing people may think of him, former prime minister Tony Abbott could legitimately be expected to be on the platform at a conservative event. Same for former deputy prime minster, and current podcaster, John Anderson. Abbott\u2019s closest adviser, Peta Credlin, now a conservative media star, is someone we would ordinarily expect also. Rather, the problem is that these ostensibly mainstream figures are legitimising the far more radical figures farther down the bill at the conference. Raheem Kassam, for example, is a former Breitbart London editor who, according to Labor senator Kristina Keneally, is a \u201ccareer bigot\u201d. Late last month, she asked that he be denied entry to the country. Kassam has repeatedly made misogynistic remarks about UK politicians.

In his time at Breitbart, he obsessively wrote about Islam in terms of terrorism and \u201cjihad\u201d, and alleged \u201cno-go zones\u201d in European cities. He amplified the latter theme into a book. Any Australian activist or leader who appears on the same stage as Kassam has clearly not reflected on the contribution that Islamophobic political commentary may have made to an Australian allegedly murdering 50 Muslims in Christchurch not five months ago. Nor have they reflected on the fact that one of Kassam\u2019s most frequent targets, London mayor Sadiq Khan, was also singled out by the Christchurch shooter in his manifesto. Some of the politicians speaking at the event also represent fairly radical understandings of \u201cconservatism\u201d. US Representative Mark Meadows, of North Carolina, once vowed to send Barack Obama \u201chome to Kenya\u201d, echoing so-called \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theories about the former president\u2019s origins. Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib, a member of the \u201csquad\u201d of leftwing congresswomen of colour, bluntly accused Meadows of racism last February. Matt Gaetz, who is listed on the website but mysteriously absent from the daily schedule, suggested ahead of last year\u2019s midterm elections that a so-called \u201ccaravan\u201d of migrants traveling through Mexico for the US border had been funded by George Soros. Gaetz\u2019s tweet came just before the Tree of Life synagogue shooting \u2014 some commentators suggested that Gaetz and others who spread such theories contributed to the atmosphere in which the murders took place. The man Raheem Kassam advised, and who he eventually sought to replace as Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, has made a political career of attacking the UK Conservative party from the right on issues such as immigration, multiculturalism and the European Union. He is generally accorded responsibility for Brexit. And home-grown spectacle Mark Latham sits for the radical rightwing party One Nation in NSW. Apart from his blustering, occasionally defamatory public pronouncements, Latham advocates for a suite of policies which are hostile to sexual and demographic minorities. Latham\u2019s bad ideas are legion. To pick some at random: he has proposed banning transgender identification, has called patriarchy a \u201cfake theory\u201d, has asserted without evidence an epidemic of \u201canti-white racism\u201d, and infamously accused a Muslim journalist of \u201caiding and abetting terrorism\u201d. One Nation, the party he leads in the NSW parliament, has policies including a Trumpian travel ban, the effective end of refugee settlement for those who arrive in boats, and a whole raft of policies singling out Muslims. The bigoted ideas expressed by some of those on the program are further legitimated when Australian conservatives effectively embrace them as their own. Islamophobia, antisemitic conspiracy theories and anti-immigrant xenophobia are not only reprehensible in their own right, but they have factored into recent mass shootings in the United States and New Zealand, and they are tearing apart democracies around the world. Does this bother the Liberals and media figures who have chosen to participate? It should certainly trouble their colleagues, and the rest of us. Jason Wilson is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s a wrap for today. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he\u2019s willing to consider proposals to reduce gun violence, including background checks, in September, after the summer recess. He said he won\u2019t be reconvening senators early, as Democratic lawmakers have urged him to do, in order to vote on a bipartisan background check bill that has already passed in the House. Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan has led a caravan to McConnell\u2019s hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to demand action on gun legislation. Donald Trump has named Joseph Maguire, the current Director of the National Counterterrorism Center the new acting director of national intelligence, following an announcement that Sue Gordon, the widely-respected deputy director, will be leaving her post next week along with current director Dan Coats. Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe has sued the bureau and the Justice Department, claiming that his firing was part of a politically motivated scheme to root out officials deemed not loyal enough to Trump. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden both equated the president with white supremacists but stopped short of outright ascribing him the label. Major Wall Street banks have handed over thousands of pages of documents to congressional committees trying to determine what financial ties Trump had to Russians, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The National Rifle Association is pushing back against proposals to strengthen background checks and expand red flag laws after this weekend\u2019s mass shootings, and the gun lobbying group has warned the president against backing such measures. In Sioux City, Iowa, Kamala Harris says that Tump\u2019s language \u201chas been about condoning the conduct and certainly accommodating the conduct of white supremacists\u201d. Asked by a reporter whether she could outright call Trump a white supremacist, she said, \u201cI think you should ask him that question.\u201d Joe Biden, similarly, stopped just short of calling the president a white supremacist, whereas other 2020 candidates like Elizabeth Warren have ascribed the label to Trump The transportation department has issued new guidance regarding animals on planes, giving this reporter an ideal opportunity to post a picture of a cute doggo on the politics liveblog. The department said that airline employees can ban any animal that they consider a safety threat, but can be apprehended for banning an entire breed of cat or dog, and Delta Airlines did with pit bulls. Airlines can also ask people \u201creasonable\u201d questions the training and vaccination of service animals brought on board and require advance notice from people who plan to travel with emotional support animals, but not those traveling with guide dogs for the blind. The transportation department plans to publish the guidelines sometime next week, according to the AP. The whole business of bringing bets on planes has been contentious of late, with airlines nothing an increase in passengers bringing pets onto planes by falsely claiming that they are emotional support animals. The new rules will aim to better regulate what is and isn\u2019t allowed across all flights. Trump announced in a tweet that he is naming Joseph Maguire, the current Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, as acting director of national intelligence. The deputy national intelligence director Sue Gordon announced she would be leaving the post earlier today. Donald Trump is has confirmed that Sue Gordon, the widely-respected deputy director of national intelligence, will be leaving her post next week, along with her national intelligence director Dan Coats. It\u2019s still unclear who will take up the post of acting director now that Gordon, who would have normally succeeded to director after Coats\u2019 departure, is leaving as well. Mitch McConnell says that he wants Congress to consider gun legislation in September after the Senate reconvenes from its summer break. New legislation to expand background checks will be \u201cfront and center\u201d at Senate debates in the fall, the Senate leader told radio host Terry Meiners of WHAS in Louisville. In the past, McConnell has staunchly opposed the idea of background checks. But he told Meiners today that he is open to considering legislation that has already passed the House, along with so-called \u201cred flag\u201d gun laws that would allow judges to take away guns from people who are deemed dangerous. However, McConnell says he will not be convening the Senate early, as House leader Nancy Pelosi and others lawmakers have requested. Bloomberg\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs is reporting that Sue Gordon, the deputy director of national intelligence, may leave her post. Dan Coats, the current national intelligence director will be stepping down next week. Gordon, a longtime CIA analyst, would be normally step in when Coats leaves \u2014 at least until Trump appoints a new director. But The New York Times recently reported that the White House has been weighing options to block her succession so that Trump can choose someone more to his liking. Gordon is a widely respected intelligence official. Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed doubts about Trump\u2019s previous top choice for the intelligence director post, Texas representative John Ratcliffe, an outspoken supporter of the president who withdrew from consideration amid questions about whether he exaggerated his resume. The Guardian has not independently confirmed these reports. Videos and news reports from the Wednesday raids in Missippi show children crying, separated from their parents. The children, some toddlers, of apprehended migrants were taken to makeshift shelters, the Guardian\u2019s Edward Helmore reports. Local reporters say that despite immigration authorities\u2019 reassurances that all the children were being cared for, some were left behind with nowhere to go The number of migrants encountered by officials at the southern border dropped more than 20% in July, compared to June. This is the first time in five months the number of people encountered by US Customs and Border Protection has dipped below 100,000. From the AP: In July, there were 82,049 people encountered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, down 21% from June when there were 104,344 people and down 43% from May. The number of families and minors crossing the border also dropped. The monthly numbers from USCBP have become a yardstick by which President Donald Trump measures the success of his administration\u2019s efforts to reduce immigration, his signature issue. The number of migrant families from Central America has risen sharply during his term despite his hardline policies... In June, after Trump threatened tariffs on Mexico, leaders there agreed to expand the administration\u2019s program forcing U.S. asylum seekers to wait on the Mexican side of the border . Mexican police, soldiers and National Guard forces are raiding hotels, buses and trains to round up Central American migrants before they can make it to the border. And they are busing migrants from the Texas border hundreds of miles to inland towns. While July\u2019s border numbers are below the peak of earlier this year, they are still high compared to recent history. Until this March, July\u2019s total would have been the highest number in at least the last six years, spanning multiple previous surges of adults and children crossing to the U.S. Nancy Pelosi is asking Donald Trump to call the Senate back into session to consider the bipartisan gun legislation that passed the House, in wake of the gun violence in El Paso, Dayton, Gilroy, and Chicago. The House speaker wrote in a letter to Trump: Mr. President, we have an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to pass gun violence prevention background checks. However, Leader Mitch McConnell, describing himself as the \u201cgrim reaper,\u201d has been an obstacle to taking any action. Today, as Speaker of the House, I am writing in good faith to request that you call the United States Senate back into session immediately under your powers in Article II Section 3 of the Constitution to consider House-passed bipartisan gun violence prevention legislation. Although Mitch McConnell is the Senate leader, Article II Section 3 of the constitution allows the president to convene either legislative body \u201con extraordinary occasions.\u201d In her letter, Pelosi says: \u201cThis extraordinary moment in our history requires all of us to take extraordinary action to save lives.\u201d That\u2019s it from me today. I\u2019m handing the blog over to my west coast colleague Maanvi Singh for the next few hours. Here is where the day stands so far: Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe has sued the bureau and the Justice Department, claiming that his firing was part of a politically motivated scheme to root out officials deemed not loyal enough to Trump. Joe Biden appeared to equate the president with white supremacists but was careful not to outright call Trump a white supremacist. \u201cI believe everything the president says and has done encourages white supremacists, and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much of a distinction,\u201d Biden said in Iowa. \u201cAs a matter of fact, it may be even worse.\u201d Major Wall Street banks have handed over thousands of pages of documents to congressional committees trying to determine what financial ties Trump had to Russians, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The National Rifle Association is pushing back against proposals to strengthen background checks and expand red flag laws after this weekend\u2019s mass shootings, and the gun lobbying group has warned the president against backing such measures. Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan is leading a caravan to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to demand action on gun legislation. Ryan\u2019s caravan is expected to arrive in Louisville in the next couple of hours, so stay tuned. The defendants named in Andrew McCabe\u2019s lawsuit are Attorney General William Barr, the Justice Department, FBI Director Christopher Wray and the FBI. But the complaint makes clear that McCabe believes Trump should ultimately be held responsible for his firing. \u201cTrump, acting in an official capacity as President of the United States, is responsible and accountable for Defendants\u2019 actions,\u201d McCabe said in the lawsuit. \u201cTrump purposefully and intentionally caused the unlawful actions of Defendants and other Executive Branch subordinates that led to Plaintiff\u2019s demotion and purported termination.\u201d Andrew McCabe claimed in a statement last year that he was \u201csingled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.\u201d But Comey himself has expressed faith that the inspector general, who concluded McCabe lied to investigators about an unauthorized media leak, acted appropriately. \u201cThis is what an organization, an institution committed to the truth, looks like. This is what accountability looks like,\u201d Comey told NPR last year. But the former FBI director added that Trump\u2019s attacks on McCabe had tarnished the reputation of the investigation. \u201cThe problem with this whole situation is the president\u2019s stained those institutions, the entire Department of Justice and the inspector general, by doing something wildly inappropriate, which is calling for Andy McCabe\u2019s head,\u201d Comey said. Andrew McCabe\u2019s lawsuit accuses Trump administration officials, including former attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, of acting as the president\u2019s \u201cenforcers\u201d to root out those perceived as disloyal. Sessions and Wray \u201cknowingly acted in furtherance of Trump\u2019s plan and scheme, with knowledge that they were implementing Trump\u2019s unconstitutional motivations for removing Plaintiff from the civil service,\u201d McCabe alleges in the lawsuit. \u201cTrump demanded Plaintiff\u2019s personal allegiance, he sought retaliation when Plaintiff refused to give it, and Sessions, Wray, and others served as Trump\u2019s personal enforcers rather than the nation\u2019s highest law enforcement officials, catering to Trump\u2019s unlawful whims instead of honoring their oaths to uphold the Constitution.\u201d Andrew McCabe\u2019s lawsuit is actually the second such complaint this week from a former FBI official. Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and ultimately fired over anti-Trump text messages he sent, sued on Tuesday to be reinstated and receive back pay. Echoing McCabe\u2019s claims, Strzok argued that his removal was \u201cpart of a broader campaign against the very principle of free speech,\u201d which he said was \u201cinitiated and led by\u201d Trump. Strzok added that the Trump administration had \u201cconsistently tolerated and even encouraged partisan political speech by federal employees\u201d as long as it was supportive of the president. \u201cIt\u2019s indisputable that his termination was a result of Trump\u2019s unrelenting retaliatory campaign of false information, attacks and direct appeals to top officials,\u201d Strzok\u2019s lawyer said in a statement. Many Republicans, including the president, have pointed to Strzok\u2019s messages with Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer with whom he was having an extramarital affair, as evidence that the Mueller investigation was biased against Trump from the beginning. Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe has sued the bureau and the Justice Department, claiming his firing was unjust and part of a plot to root out officials who were not loyal to Trump. The Washington Post reports: McCabe asked that a federal judge declare his termination a \u2018legal nullity\u2019 and essentially allow him to retire from the FBI as planned, with all the benefits that would have afforded him. He was fired from the bureau in March 2018, a little more than 24 hours before McCabe was set to retire, costing him significant retirement benefits. The termination came after the Justice Department inspector general found that McCabe made an unauthorized disclosure to the media, then lied to investigators about it. \u2018It was Trump\u2019s unconstitutional plan and scheme to discredit and remove DOJ and FBI employees who were deemed to be his partisan opponents because they were not politically loyal to him,\u2019 the lawsuit alleges, adding that McCabe\u2019s firing \u2018was a critical element of Trump\u2019s plan and scheme.\u2019 Joe Biden, who is campaigning at the Iowa State Fair, said there isn\u2019t \u201cmuch of a distinction\u201d between Trump being a white supremacist and how he has encouraged such extremists. When asked if considers Trump a white supremacist, Biden replied, \u201cI believe everything the president says and has done encourages white supremacists, and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much of a distinction. As a matter of fact, it may be even worse.\u201d Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and Republican campaign committees have announced they will not spend money on Twitter advertising after the social media giant locked an account affiliated with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s campaign. \u201cTwitter\u2019s hostile actions toward Leader McConnell\u2019s campaign are outrageous, and we will not tolerate it,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, a spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cThe NRSC will suspend all spending with Twitter until further notice. We will not spend our resources on a platform that silences conservatives.\u201d Twitter said the campaign was locked out of its account because a video it posted of a protest in front of McConnell\u2019s home violated the platform\u2019s rules about posting threats. \u201cThe user was temporarily locked out of their account for a Tweet that violated our violent threats policy, specifically threats involving physical safety,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said. Representative Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who is also running for president, is leading a caravan to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s hometown of Louisville, Kenticky, demanding action to reduce gun violence. The caravan, which is co-led by the gun-control group Moms Demand Action, started in Ryan\u2019s hometown of Niles, Ohio. It will make its sixth and final stop in downtown Louisville, 376 miles from Niles, at 7:30 p.m. EDT. \u201cIt\u2019s been 150+ days since the House passed 2 comprehensive gun reform bills &amp; Mitch Mcconnell still has done nothing,\u201d Ryan said in a tweet announcing the caravan. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d The State Department has suspended a staffer in its energy bureau after the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that he had ties to a white supremacist group. The SPLC reported: The official, Matthew Q. Gebert, works as a foreign affairs officer assigned to the Bureau of Energy Resources, a State Department spokesperson told Hatewatch. Online, and in private correspondences with other white nationalists, Gebert uses \u2018Coach Finstock\u2019 as a pseudonym. Through that alias, he expressed a desire to build a country for whites only. \u2018[Whites] need a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,\u2019 \u2018Coach Finstock\u2019 said on a May 2018 episode of \u2018The Fatherland,\u2019 a white nationalist podcast. \u2018That\u2019s all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles.\u2019 Former State Department officials expressed shock that Gebert was able to obtain a security clearance. \u201cIf Gebert was Muslim or a person of color, it would have been caught,\u201d Amos Hochstein, who was Gebert\u2019s boss at the State Department, told Politico. \u201cNeo-Nazis are not all shaved heads and tattoos, they are hiding in plain sight. I\u2019m horrified Gebert worked for me at the State Department.\u201c Elizabeth Warren once again went after Trump for intensifying racism in America, saying the president \u201ccozies up to the white supremacists.\u201d \u201cThis is what he\u2019s done, the wink and a nod,\u201d Warren said during a campaign stop in Iowa. \u201cAnd he can\u2019t have it both ways. He can\u2019t keep trying to stir this up ... and then say, \u2018Oh, but not me.\u2019\u201d In an interview with the New York Times yesterday, Warren was asked if she considers Trump himself a white supremacist. \u201cYes,\u201d Warren replied without hesitation. Trump claimed over Twitter that Iran wants \u201cdesperately\u201d to negotiate with the United States but is receiving \u201cmixed signals\u201d from other parties, including Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said last month that the door to negotiations was \u201cwide open\u201d if Trump lifted sanctions on the country, which have significantly harmed the Iranian economy. \u201cOnce those sanctions are lifted, then ... the room for negotiation is wide open,\u201d Zarif told NBC News. The CEO of a nonprofit advocating for democratic reform in Iran tweeted this in reaction to Trump\u2019s claim: Immigration officials arrested 680 people, mostly Latinos, in a series of raids at Mississippi food processing plants yesterday. The arrests mark the largest workplace immigration sting in at least 10 years. Our colleague Jessica Glenza reports: The raids took place just hours before Donald Trump was scheduled to visit El Paso, Texas, the majority-Latino city rocked by the recent mass shooting that left 22 people dead. ... Bill Chandler, president of the Mississippi Immigrant Rights Alliance, told the Jackson Free Press he is in touch with schools, where children may have been left behind on Wednesday after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) federal agents detained their parents. He added that Ice agents attempted to arrest at least one American citizen. The raids left local communities to pick up the pieces after children were separated from their parents by the raids on the first day of the new school session after the summer break. In Forest, Mississippi, one local news report found children were left without a place to stay when they were locked out of their homes, and were forced to sleep in a local gym. Democrats and immigrants rights groups condemned the raids over social media. From Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke: From the American Civil Liberties Union: From the policy director for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights-Los Angeles: Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who used to represent part of El Paso in the House, criticized Trump for discussing the crowd size of his February rally in the city while visiting with medical staff who aided the victims of Saturday\u2019s mass shooting. A video surfaced earlier today showing Trump making the comments while meeting with staff at the University Medical Center of El Paso. \u201cThat was some crowd, and we had twice the number outside,\u201d the president said. He went on to slam \u201ccrazy Beto,\u201d who held a rally in the city on the same day and \u201chad like 400 people in a parking lot.\u201d Multiple Democratic presidential candidates, including Montana Governor Steve Bullock, are campaigning in Iowa this week to capitalize on the the state fair: Time: \u2018Enough\u2019 The new cover of Time magazine names places affected by gun violence in the US, highlighting the many mass shootings that have taken place in America already this year - usually defined as a crime in which three or more people are killed by a shooter in a single incident. The names of Gilroy, California; Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, can be clearly seen, as the locations of the three mass shootings that happened inside of a week, all surrounding the word \u201cEnough\u201d. Major Wall Street banks have handed over thousands of pages of documents related to Russians who may have had ties to the president. The material has been given to congressional committees investigating Donald Trump, and the documents relate to Russians who have possibly had dealings with him, his family or his business, people familiar with the congressional investigations have told the Wall Street Journal. Some banks are also giving documents related the Trump Organization to New York state investigators, people familiar with the New York investigation said. Firms include Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. They have reportedly recently provided the documents to congressional investigators, people familiar with those investigations told the Journal. The House financial services committee and the House intelligence committee are looking into potential foreign influence on the Trumps. Separately, Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump\u2019s primary bank, has reportedly turned over emails, loan agreements and other documents related to the Trump Organization to the office of New York attorney general Letitia James. Here is where the day stands so far: A video has emerged from Trump\u2019s visit with hospital staff in El Paso yesterday, in which he brags about the crowd size of his February rally in the city and mocks \u201ccrazy\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke. The National Rifle Association wrote an 18-part Twitter thread signaling their opposition to expanding background checks or red-flag laws. The gun lobbying group has also reportedly warned Trump against backing such proposals. Trump is considering commuting the prison sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. The former Democratic governor was found guilty of federal corruption after being caught on tape trying to sell Barack Obama\u2019s Senate seat. Another House Democrat, Gerry Connolly, announced his support for launching an impeachment inquiry into Trump. The blog is still covering more fallout from this weekend\u2019s shootings, so stay tuned. In an 18-part Twitter thread, the National Rifle Association addressed this weekend\u2019s mass shootings and tried to direct attention away from proposals to expand background checks or red flag laws. The gun lobbying group said it would \u201cwork in good faith to pursue real solutions to the violence we witnessed this past weekend.\u201d It then went on to undercut many of the proposed solutions to reduce such violence. \u201cIt is the NRA\u2019s long-standing position that those who have been adjudicated as a danger to themselves or others should not have access to firearms and should be admitted for treatment,\u201d the group tweeted. \u201cBut, there needs to be real evidence of danger \u2013 and we cannot sacrifice anyone\u2019s constitutional rights without due process.\u201d That controversial argument would seemingly rule out red flag laws, which allow a judge to take guns away from anyone deemed too dangerous to possess firearms. On expanding background checks, the group said, \u201cIt is not enough anymore to simply say that \u2018we need more background checks.\u2019 Considering both suspects in El Paso and Dayton passed them, that is rhetoric for billionaire activists and campaign rallies \u2013 not a call for constructive progress.\u201d Many gun-control supporters have made the argument that while no one law will prevent all mass shootings, measures like strengthening background checks could go a long way in reducing such tragedies. The NRA also tried to deflect attention away from El Paso and Dayton to Chicago, where gun violence is frequent despite Illinois\u2019 relatively strong laws on the issue. But an analysis found that 60% of firearms recovered after crimes in the city came from neighboring states, such as Indiana, with weaker guns laws. Patti Blagojevich, who is married to former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, expressed hope after Trump said he was considering commuting her husband\u2019s prison sentence for federal corruption. Another person who is reportedly supportive of commuting Blagojevich\u2019s sentence: Jared Kushner. The New York Times reports: Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser who has internally championed pardons and commutations, had suggested Mr. Blagojevich be pardoned, saying that it would appeal to Democrats, [a person familiar with the talks] said. Other aides told Mr. Trump that such a move would be politically unwise given the nature of Mr. Blagojevich\u2019s conviction; instead, commuting the sentence was what had been settled on. Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur whose surprising presidential bid has attracted attention for its universal basic income proposal, has qualified for the September debate. Yang registered at 2 percent in a newly released Monmouth University poll of the early voting state Iowa. He already had three other qualifying polls and 130,000 unique donors, crossing the two thresholds outlined by the Democratic National Committee. Yang becomes the ninth person to qualify for the debate. The other guaranteed participants are: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Juli\u00e1n Castro remains one poll short of qualifying, having registered at less than 1 percent in the Monmouth survey. Biden led in the Monmouth poll, attracting the support of 28 percent of Democratic respondents in Iowa. But Warren is gaining on the former vice president, registering at 19 percent. That\u2019s a 12-point bump since April. Sanders, meanwhile, has seen his numbers drop 7 points in that same time frame. He now trails Harris, attracting 9 percent of support to her 11 percent. While meeting yesterday with some of the El Paso medical staff who aided the victims of a mass shooting that killed 22, Trump took a moment to brag about the crowd size at his February rally in the city. \u201cThat was some crowd, and we had twice the number outside,\u201d Trump said at the University Medical Center of El Paso. He went on to slam \u201ccrazy\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke, who held a rally in the city on the same day and \u201chad like 400 people in a parking lot.\u201d Reports emerged this week that Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has an unpaid tab of more than $500,000 to the city of El Paso for the rally. During his visit, the president also applauded the medical staff for the \u201cfantastic job\u201d it has done aiding the shooting victims. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about you all over the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be with you.\u201d Nancy Pelosi is leading a bipartisan congressional delegation to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, after which the group will see a migrant detention center in McAllen, Texas. \u201cAs our high-powered delegation begins our visit to the Northern Triangle, we look forward to strengthening our partnership to enhance regional security and stability, create greater economic opportunity, combat corruption and advance human rights to make it safer for people to thrive in their communities,\u201d the House speaker said in a statement. \u201cWe also look forward to honoring the cultural and family ties that connect our people and the enormous contributions that generations of immigrants from the region have made to the United States.\u201d Pelosi noted that many members of the delegation have visited the border several times already to draw attention to the horrendous conditions of migrant detention centers there. Trump has turned his focus to the Federal Reserve, which he has repeatedly bashed for not lowering interest rates fast enough. Ironically, the central bank did announce last week that it was cutting interest rates for the first time in a decade. Explaining the decision, Chairman Jay Powell cited the slowing growth of the US economy, partly due to Trump\u2019s trade wars. Trump is once again toying with the idea of commuting the sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who is currently serving a 14-year prison term for federal corruption. \u201cI thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly,\u201d Trump told reporters yesterday aboard Air Force One. The former Democratic governor, who also appeared on Trump\u2019s show Celebrity Apprentice shortly before he was convicted, was caught on tape trying to sell the Senate seat of Barack Obama after he won the presidency. \u201cI\u2019ve got this thing, and it\u2019s fucking golden. I\u2019m just not giving it up for fucking nothing,\u201d Blagojevich was recorded saying. The commutation, which Trump said he is \u201cvery strongly\u201d considering, would likely be opposed by Illinois Republicans. Representative Adam Kinzinger previously called the idea, which Trump floated last year, \u201cstupid\u201d. Another House Democrat, Gerry Connolly of Virginia, has come out in favor of launching an impeachment inquiry into Trump. \u201cI caution that we cannot allow ourselves to become so desensitized to the President\u2019s behavior that there are no consequences,\u201d Connolly said in a statement announcing his support. \u201cNow more than ever, Congress must assert its constitutional role and that is why I believe we must immediately start an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\u201d Connolly is the 119th House Democrat to back an inquiry, according to the Washington Post\u2019s count. But Nancy Pelosi does not seem to have changed her position on launching impeachment proceedings, despite a majority of the House speaker\u2019s caucus supporting such a move. Former president Bill Clinton has called for reinstating the assault weapons ban that he signed into law in 1994. The 10-year law, a provision of the controversial 1994 crime bill, expired in 2004 and has not been reauthorized, despite evidence that it reduced the the number of deaths from mass shootings. \u201cI worked hard to pass and was proud to sign the ban on these weapons of war into law, and the results were clear: mass shooting fatalities declined while they were in effect and have risen sharply since they were allowed to lapse,\u201d Clinton wrote in an op-ed for Time magazine. \u201cFor too long, America has allowed a determined, well-financed group to pretend to grieve with us while spreading paranoia among those who responsibly use guns for hunting, sport shooting and self-protection. For too long, the gun lobby and their elected allies have stalled, deflected and changed the conversation until the pressure abates and they can get back to business, heedless of the killings inevitably yet to come.\u201d Clinton also called on Americans to \u201cstand against, not inflame, the racial, religious and gender-based bigotries that often drive the delusions of mass killers.\u201d Kamala Harris released the first television ad of her presidential campaign, part of a six-figure ad buy in Iowa this week. In the video, the California senator uses her biography to tout the merits of her campaign platform. Harris says her mother would \u201cwork all day then pour her whole heart into Maya and me when she got home,\u201d referring to the senator\u2019s sister and campaign chairwoman. \u201cAnd then, after we were fed and in bed, our mother would sit up trying to figure out how to make it all work.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what my \u20183am Agenda\u2019 is all about \u2013 a real plan to help you solve those worries,\u201d Harris continues. \u201cThe biggest middle-class tax cut in a generation; another $500 in your pocket every month, paid for by repealing Donald Trump\u2019s tax breaks for the top one percent and the richest corporations in America; healthcare for all with Medicare for All; and for companies that don\u2019t pay women the same as men, new fines on their profits until they do.\u201d The ad makes Harris the first major presidential candidate to launch a television ad in Iowa, and it comes as she embarks on a five-day bus tour across the state. The Twitter account for Mitch McConnell\u2019s re-election campaign was locked out after it posted a video of a protest outside his home in Louisville, Kentucky. The video was filmed as many supporters of gun control have called on the Senate majority leader to take up a background checks bill that has already passed the House. In the video, Black Lives Matter Louisville leader Chanelle Helm said that McConnell, who recently injured his shoulder in a fall, \u201cshould have broken his little raggedy, wrinkled-(expletive) neck.\u201d A Twitter spokesperson said of the decision, \u201cThe user was temporarily locked out of their account for a Tweet that violated our violent threats policy, specifically threats involving physical safety.\u201d But McConnell\u2019s team claimed the decision was evidence of the social media platform\u2019s bias. \u201cThis morning, Twitter locked our account for posting the video of real-world, violent threats made against Mitch McConnell. This is a problem with the speech police in America today,\u201d McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, Kevin Golden, told the Louisville Courier Journal. \u201cThe Lexington Herald-Leader can attack Mitch with cartoon tombstones of his opponents. But we can\u2019t mock it. \u201cTwitter will allow the words of \u2018Massacre Mitch\u2019 to trend nationally on their platform but locks our account for posting actual threats against us,\u201d Golden added. \u201cWe appealed and Twitter stood by their decision, saying our account will remain locked until we delete the video.\u201d Two Democratic presidential candidates \u2013 Elizabeth Warren and Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 said in separate interviews yesterday that they considered Trump to be a white supremacist. Asked by the New York Times whether she considered Trump a white supremacist, Warren offered an unequivocal, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHe has given aid and comfort to white supremacists,\u201d the Massachusetts senator said. \u201cHe\u2019s done the wink and a nod. He has talked about white supremacists as fine people. He\u2019s done everything he can to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country.\u201d Hour earlier, O\u2019Rourke was asked about Trump being a white supremacist while doing an MSNBC interview. \u201cHe is,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. The comments mark a significant escalation in 2020 Democrats\u2019 accusations against the president, and it\u2019s unclear who will join the pair in their description. Frontrunner Joe Biden said in a speech yesterday that Trump had \u201cfanned the flames of white supremacy.\u201d But that was his strongest condemnation of the president yet, and it still seems like a significantly lesser charge than calling Trump himself a white supremacist. Good morning, live blog readers! Donald Trump is back in Washington today after spending yesterday in Dayton and El Paso to meet with victims and first responders of this weekend\u2019s two mass shootings. But his visits likely hurt more than they helped. The president was met by hundreds of protesters along the way, and he spent his time on Air Force One tweeting that Joe Biden\u2019s speech on white supremacy was \u201csooo boring\u201d and falsely accusing Ohio Democratic officials of lying about his Dayton visit. It served as another stark reminder of how Trump consistently falls short on playing a key presidential role in the era of mass shootings: consoler-in-chief. The visits also came as calls for action to combat gun violence have intensified. More than 200 mayors have signed on to a letter demanding the Senate take up gun legislation, as congressional Democrats continue their calls for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to consider the background checks bill that has already passed the House. And while Trump has claimed he is open to extending background checks, his advisers and the National Rifle Association have warned him against it. All of this has led many in Washington to believe that after yet another horrific mass shooting, nothing will change. Here is what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump has a light schedule today, receiving his intelligence briefing and meeting with Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, in the afternoon. That could leave him plenty of time to tweet more criticisms of his opponents. Multiple Democratic presidential candidates \u2013- including Biden, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 will campaign in Iowa today. Other presidential contenders \u2013 including Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg \u2013 will speak at National Association of Black Journalists\u2019 forum in Miami. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",
