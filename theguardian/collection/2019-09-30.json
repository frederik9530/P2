United have won only once since their opening 4-0 victory over Chelsea, with Marcus Rashford's penalty earning them a 1-0 home win against Leicester.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Fall from grace:</b>&nbsp;It is just two years since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho oversaw United's joint-best start to a Premier League season. United claimed 19 points from their first seven games in 2017-18, equalling the starts made by Sir Alex Ferguson's sides in 1999-2000 and 2011-12. United finished runners-up under Mourinho that season, but a whopping 19 points adrift of champions Manchester City.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Ole at the wheel:</b> The figures make bleak reading for Solskj\u00e6r when comparing the Norwegian's record with his predecessors. Mourinho \u2013 who would be sacked in December \u2013 made a poor start last season, but his 10-point haul from the first seven games was still one more than Solskj\u00e6r has managed 12 months on. David Moyes also took 10 points from his first seven games in the 2013-14 season, while Louis van Gaal won 11 and 16 points in the respective 2014-15 and 2015-16 campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>30-year low:</b> The last time United made such a poor start to a campaign was under Ferguson in the days of the old First Division. United picked up only seven points from their first seven games of the 1989-90 season, a run that brought successive defeats to Derby, Norwich and Everton and ended with a famous 5-1 thrashing by Manchester City at Maine Road. United ended up 13th that season, but lifted the FA Cup as Ferguson won his first trophy in England. <b>PA Media</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Unai Emery, the Arsenal manager, described the game as 50-50 and tried to exonerate Granit Xhaka, the club\u2019s newly-installed captain, for seeming to duck out of the way of McTominay\u2019s shot for the opening goal. Xhaka had played with \u201cbig commitment\u201d, according to his manager. Emery added that he had not seen the replays of United\u2019s goal but that he had noted how determined Xhaka was to sprint back into position as the home team launched their counter-attack from an Arsenal corner.</p> \n<p>Solskj\u00e6r, who said that Anthony Martial might not be back from injury until after the next international break, thought his team ought to have been awarded a penalty and he was also unhappy about the unusual circumstances leading to Aubameyang\u2019s goal.</p> \n<p>United\u2019s argument was that their players hesitated when they saw the flag being raised. \u201cAshley [Young] certainly holds his hand up,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHe looks straight at the linesman and maybe hesitates when he could have got a block in. That probably would have helped David [de Gea] but it is no consolation. It\u2019s a perfectly good goal for them, the linesman probably should have kept the flag down.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get out of the blocks quickly enough at the start of the second half. It felt like Arsenal were the more proactive until they scored their goal. I felt we could get a goal at the end and we sent men forward. I\u2019ve been in that situation as a player when you come off and think you could have got more out of a game but we\u2019ll learn from this.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r insisted he was still confident of Manchester United having a successful year after a 1-1 draw with Arsenal condemned the 20-times Premier League champions to their worst start to a season for 30 years. United\u2019s tally of nine points from their opening seven fixtures is the first time since the 1989-90 season they have not reached double figures but Solskj\u00e6r argued that his team\u2019s performances had merited a better return \u2013 and he took a swipe at the media who, he believes, have exaggerated their problems. \u201cThere are many things that give me loads of confidence,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cWe can talk about performance but it\u2019s results that matter. You can talk about results, I can talk about six out of seven good performances. West Ham, we know, was below par [losing 2-0] but it wasn\u2019t as bad as you lot made it out to be.\u201d In a match of low quality, Scott McTominay had given United a first-half lead but Arsenal equalised just before the hour when VAR overturned an offside decision that had initially ruled out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s goal. \u201cHow many times have we been 1-0 up and not got the second goal?\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThis is a steep learning curve for us and we\u2019ll keep working hard and, with more experience, we\u2019ll make the right decisions. It\u2019s another game that we\u2019re 1-0 up \u2013 Southampton, Wolverhampton, we need to learn to win these games.\u201d The draw leaves United in 10th position while Arsenal move up to fourth but the Old Trafford crowd remained supportive of Solskj\u00e6r and his players \u2013 and the manager also received the backing of Roy Keane, his former team-mate. Keane\u2019s view in his role as a television pundit was that Solskj\u00e6r should \u201c100%\u201d be given more time. \u201cI think he has been brilliant, a good honest guy,\u201d the former United captain told Sky Sports. \u201cIt is hard work at the moment but there are six or seven young players learning their way. We\u2019re all very impatient, we want success yesterday, but you have to give the man time. He is frustrated, under pressure, but dealing with it. He\u2019s a classy guy but no doubt he will be disappointed at not winning enough games. \u201cThey have given him the job, so support him in a couple of transfer windows. Are there more tough days ahead? You bet your life but you need to stick with it. There was a lack of quality from both teams tonight. Their lack of goals, the lack of opportunities they\u2019re creating. Give these boys time. But on tonight\u2019s performance, none of them [neither Manchester United nor Arsenal] will be in the top four.\u201d Unai Emery, the Arsenal manager, described the game as 50-50 and tried to exonerate Granit Xhaka, the club\u2019s newly-installed captain, for seeming to duck out of the way of McTominay\u2019s shot for the opening goal. Xhaka had played with \u201cbig commitment\u201d, according to his manager. Emery added that he had not seen the replays of United\u2019s goal but that he had noted how determined Xhaka was to sprint back into position as the home team launched their counter-attack from an Arsenal corner. Solskj\u00e6r, who said that Anthony Martial might not be back from injury until after the next international break, thought his team ought to have been awarded a penalty and he was also unhappy about the unusual circumstances leading to Aubameyang\u2019s goal. United\u2019s argument was that their players hesitated when they saw the flag being raised. \u201cAshley [Young] certainly holds his hand up,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHe looks straight at the linesman and maybe hesitates when he could have got a block in. That probably would have helped David [de Gea] but it is no consolation. It\u2019s a perfectly good goal for them, the linesman probably should have kept the flag down.\u201d He added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get out of the blocks quickly enough at the start of the second half. It felt like Arsenal were the more proactive until they scored their goal. I felt we could get a goal at the end and we sent men forward. I\u2019ve been in that situation as a player when you come off and think you could have got more out of a game but we\u2019ll learn from this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The shy and elusive pine marten, a woodland creature almost hunted to extinction in the UK, has been reintroduced to a forest in the English west country. Eighteen of the animals have been released at a secret and remote location in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. Conservationists hope the animals will breed, spread and eventually link up with a group of pine martens that was reintroduced across the border in Wales. It is possible the reintroduction will help manage the number of non-native grey squirrels in the forest and anywhere else the pine martens reach. Pine martens, which belong to the same family as otters and weasels, were once common in the UK. They are similar in size to a domestic cat with slim bodies, brown fur, a distinctive cream bib on their throats, long, bushy tails and prominent rounded ears. Extensive hunting, together with the loss of their woodland home, have led to them being pushed out to more remote parts of the UK. Their only remaining stronghold is in the Highlands of Scotland.

We must also take action to support nature\u2019s recovery.\u201d Catherine McNicol, the trust\u2019s conservation project manager, said people were unlikely to see pine martens soon. \u201cPine martens are elusive and shy animals, with their presence often only indicated by scats in the middle of forestry tracks,\u201d she said. \u201cThey only give birth to a few kits each year if breeding is even successful, so the rate of marten population recovery in the UK is low.\u201d Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust is working with several organisations on the project including Forestry England, the Vincent Wildlife Trust and Forest Research. Rebecca Wilson, Forestry England\u2019s planning and environment manager in west England, said: \u201cAs native omnivores, pine martens play a vital role in the delicate balance of woodland ecosystems",

Sinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald said they were \u201cabsolutely out of the question\u201d, while SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour said the proposals were \u201cutterly unworkable\u201d. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: \u201cThey would place an enormous administrative burden on businesses and rely on technology that does not yet exist.</p> \n<p>\u201cCrucially, if true, they represent a rowing back on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago that there would be no return to a hard border or related checks or controls.\u201d</p> \n<p>The leak comes as Johnson puts his finishing touches on formal written proposals expected to go to Brussels in the next week for a revised Brexit deal.</p> \n<p>Although all the indications are that a large gap remains in thinking, signs have emerged that the hardline position of the Conservative party\u2019s most Eurosceptic backbenchers has softened just days before Boris Johnson\u2019s team are due to enter a \u201ctunnel\u201d of secret negotiations with Brussels.</p> \n<p>Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, has opened the door to a potential Brexit deal, indicating he would look at one even if it included a version of the controversial Irish border backstop to which the Eurosceptic ERG was once implacably opposed.</p> \n<p>During a heated and sometimes bad-tempered event on the party conference fringe, he indicated that the \u201cSpartan\u201d wing of the party was in the mood for a deal.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That\u2019s not true,\u201d he said referring to the bloc of 28 backbenchers who voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal three times.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully, because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. So I\u2019ll look at a deal if there is one,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Francois\u2019 comments were seen as a subtle shift in approach for the ERG, whose support could unlock a deal for Johnson.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f7a22732-f379-4368-8b27-6076c25d93de\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>&nbsp;and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n    <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.</p>\n    <p>Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.</p>\n    <p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey\"><b>Daniel Boffey</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As recently as August, the de facto whip of the ERG warned that Johnson must honour his promise to kill off Theresa May\u2019s deal completely.</p> \n<p>Johnson has publicly said May\u2019s withdrawal agreement is dead but the formal proposals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/25/brexit-uk-must-table-proposals-irish-backstop-next-week-leo-varadkar\">due to go to the EU next week</a>, are expected to revolve around a revised backstop for Northern Ireland involving an agreement for agri-food on the island of Ireland and a possible time limit on the other elements of the backstop.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy acid test will be: does it mean we genuinely leave the EU?\u201d Francois told a meeting organised by the Eurosceptic thinktank Bruges Group.</p> \n<p>He said his support for a deal \u201crather depends what\u2019s in it \u2026 As a so-called Spartan, if it means we genuinely leave the EU, if it means we genuinely leave on Halloween, I will be the first in the aye lobby. If it really means we don\u2019t, then I will vote against it and if we don\u2019t no amount of browbeating will make me change my mind.\u201d</p> \n<p>His remarks follow weeks of shifting mood over the Irish backstop. The Democratic Unionist party, which was implacably opposed to the backstop, has also indicated it was in the mood for a deal. It is understood that the DUP has been consulted on the plans that Johnson is to take to Brussels next week.</p> \n<p>Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also hinted last week that there could be amendments to the withdrawal agreement but warned there was still a huge gap between the UK and Irish positions.</p> \n<p>The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said she would look at the possibility of a backstop with a time limit but warned that agreeing to consider one was not the same as \u201cadvocating\u201d one.</p> \n<p>She told the Bruges Group: \u201cIt would be good to get rid of the iniquitous backstop\u201d but added that it would be \u201cgood to get a deal\u201d.</p> \n<p>She called for space to be given to negotiators, who now have fewer than 17 days to come up with a deal before the next EU summit.</p>",

The ideas, which mark a departure from his promise not to put infrastructure on the border, are part of four unofficial papers submitted by the UK to Brussels by Johnson\u2019s team. The broadcaster RT\u00c9, which has had sight of the the tightly guarded proposals, is reporting that customs clearance sites would be sited five to 10 miles from the border to the north and the south to deal with imports and exports. Traders would have the choice of lodging their papers at these sites, similar to the ones that existed before the single market came into existence, or electing to be tracked electronically in an online \u201ctransit\u201d arrangement. The idea of permanent clearance sites on both sides of the border, even five to 10 miles away, and real-time tracking of the movements of goods are unlikely to be supported by the Irish government. A spokesman for Downing Street said: \u201cNothing we are proposing involves checks or controls at the border. That is an absolute commitment.\u201d A government source said the report was a misrepresentation of the \u201cnon-paper\u201d, which discussed customs checks at place of origin or destination of goods. In the limited cases that inspections were needed, physical checks could be at dedicated premises, factories or production sites, the source suggested. But Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, dismissed the proposals as a \u201cnon-starter\u201d, and called for a \u201cserious proposal\u201d from the UK. Sinn F\u00e9in in Ireland and the Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland also dismissed the plans on Monday night. Sinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald said they were \u201cabsolutely out of the question\u201d, while SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable.\u201d Labour said the proposals were \u201cutterly unworkable\u201d. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: \u201cThey would place an enormous administrative burden on businesses and rely on technology that does not yet exist. \u201cCrucially, if true, they represent a rowing back on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago that there would be no return to a hard border or related checks or controls.\u201d The leak comes as Johnson puts his finishing touches on formal written proposals expected to go to Brussels in the next week for a revised Brexit deal. Although all the indications are that a large gap remains in thinking, signs have emerged that the hardline position of the Conservative party\u2019s most Eurosceptic backbenchers has softened just days before Boris Johnson\u2019s team are due to enter a \u201ctunnel\u201d of secret negotiations with Brussels. Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, has opened the door to a potential Brexit deal, indicating he would look at one even if it included a version of the controversial Irish border backstop to which the Eurosceptic ERG was once implacably opposed. During a heated and sometimes bad-tempered event on the party conference fringe, he indicated that the \u201cSpartan\u201d wing of the party was in the mood for a deal. \u201cIt has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That\u2019s not true,\u201d he said referring to the bloc of 28 backbenchers who voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal three times. \u201cIf there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully, because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. So I\u2019ll look at a deal if there is one,\u201d he said. Francois\u2019 comments were seen as a subtle shift in approach for the ERG, whose support could unlock a deal for Johnson. As recently as August, the de facto whip of the ERG warned that Johnson must honour his promise to kill off Theresa May\u2019s deal completely. Johnson has publicly said May\u2019s withdrawal agreement is dead but the formal proposals, due to go to the EU next week, are expected to revolve around a revised backstop for Northern Ireland involving an agreement for agri-food on the island of Ireland and a possible time limit on the other elements of the backstop. \u201cMy acid test will be: does it mean we genuinely leave the EU?\u201d Francois told a meeting organised by the Eurosceptic thinktank Bruges Group. He said his support for a deal \u201crather depends what\u2019s in it \u2026 As a so-called Spartan, if it means we genuinely leave the EU, if it means we genuinely leave on Halloween, I will be the first in the aye lobby. If it really means we don\u2019t, then I will vote against it and if we don\u2019t no amount of browbeating will make me change my mind.\u201d His remarks follow weeks of shifting mood over the Irish backstop. The Democratic Unionist party, which was implacably opposed to the backstop, has also indicated it was in the mood for a deal. It is understood that the DUP has been consulted on the plans that Johnson is to take to Brussels next week. Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also hinted last week that there could be amendments to the withdrawal agreement but warned there was still a huge gap between the UK and Irish positions. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said she would look at the possibility of a backstop with a time limit but warned that agreeing to consider one was not the same as \u201cadvocating\u201d one. She told the Bruges Group: \u201cIt would be good to get rid of the iniquitous backstop\u201d but added that it would be \u201cgood to get a deal\u201d. She called for space to be given to negotiators, who now have fewer than 17 days to come up with a deal before the next EU summit.",

United have won only once since their opening 4-0 victory over Chelsea, with Marcus Rashford's penalty earning them a 1-0 home win against Leicester.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Fall from grace:</b>&nbsp;It is just two years since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho oversaw United's joint-best start to a Premier League season. United claimed 19 points from their first seven games in 2017-18, equalling the starts made by Sir Alex Ferguson's sides in 1999-2000 and 2011-12. United finished runners-up under Mourinho that season, but a whopping 19 points adrift of champions Manchester City.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Ole at the wheel:</b> The figures make bleak reading for Solskj\u00e6r when comparing the Norwegian's record with his predecessors. Mourinho \u2013 who would be sacked in December \u2013 made a poor start last season, but his 10-point haul from the first seven games was still one more than Solskj\u00e6r has managed 12 months on. David Moyes also took 10 points from his first seven games in the 2013-14 season, while Louis van Gaal won 11 and 16 points in the respective 2014-15 and 2015-16 campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>30-year low:</b> The last time United made such a poor start to a campaign was under Ferguson in the days of the old First Division. United picked up only seven points from their first seven games of the 1989-90 season, a run that brought successive defeats to Derby, Norwich and Everton and ended with a famous 5-1 thrashing by Manchester City at Maine Road. United ended up 13th that season, but lifted the FA Cup as Ferguson won his first trophy in England. <b>PA Media</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is a third mistake here, a structural one.

For months, Macron has been promoting a plan aimed at defusing tensions in the Persian Gulf, exchanging US sanctions relief for full Iranian compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal and Tehran\u2019s agreement to pursue broader talks. Trump, however, has been ratcheting up sanctions in recent weeks and announced more punitive measures in his speech to the UN earlier the same day Macron wanted Rouhani to talk to him. Iran\u2019s economy has been hard hit by a US oil and banking embargo, and diplomatic sources in New York said it was never remotely likely Rouhani would speak to Trump without sanctions relief. The Iranian president spoke by phone to Barack Obama at the UN in 2013 without the prior consent of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and was heavily criticised after returning home. Rouhani said on Monday that a return was possible to multilateral talks established at the time of the 2015 nuclear deal, that would include the US as part of a group of six major powers known as the P5+1. According to the Entekhab news site, Rouhani said \u201cthere was some readiness created for the P5+1\u201d and that \u201call 7 countries [Iran and the US] reached agreement over the P5+1 framework\u201d. Rouhani said he would reveal more details at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

      "body": "<p>Such is life for the modern Manchester United that the first point to make is that their supporters no longer need to check the bottom half of the Premier League table to find their team.</p> \n<p>This result lifts them from 11th to 10th, just above the jagged line. It is still not where they want to be \u2013 but Arsenal did enough, ultimately, to warrant a point from a thud-and-blunder evening that demonstrated how far these old rivals have to go before they can harbour realistic title ambitions. On this evidence it is going to be a long way back. Scott McTominay did score a peach of a goal for United but, last season included, the difficult truth for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is that his team have not managed more than one goal in 11 of their last 12 league fixtures.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/30/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-backs-players-worst-start-30-years\">Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r backs his players despite worst start in 30 years</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang supplied Arsenal\u2019s equaliser after VAR had overturned a rotten offside decision and, points-wise, it is the first time since the 1989-90 season that United have not reached double figures from their first seven games. That is the same season, it may be recalled, that Old Trafford chanted for Bryan Robson to take over and a banner appeared in the stands calling for Alex Ferguson, then just a plain old Mister, to be removed from office.</p> \n<p>This time the crowd is nothing like as grumpy. The weather is still the same, of course, although it would probably be a bit too generous on the two sets of players to blame the near-unremitting Mancunian downpour for their inability to pass the ball more stylishly. It was an accident-prone evening, littered with clumsiness, and it told a clear story about why these sides are already playing catch-up to Liverpool and Manchester City in the top two positions. Nobody should realistically expect them to win that chase.</p> \n<p>Not that the lack of real quality \u2013 and it was startling at times \u2013 stopped the game from burning slowly into an entertaining contest. The first half, in truth, was a bit of a stinker. Or at least it was until McTominay grew weary of the torpor and, 20 yards out, smacked in a firecracker of a shot. After that, however, there was lots of drama and incident at either end, not least the equalising goal when Aubameyang was initially judged to be offside in the moments before he flicked the ball over David de Gea.</p> \n<p>It turned out to be a particularly poor judgment from a trigger-happy linesman and possibly the easiest VAR decision yet. Harry Maguire had been playing Aubameyang onside by some distance. United did have a reasonable argument De Gea would have made more of an effort to block the shot had he not seen the raised flag.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddb79181-f3c4-45bb-89d0-3a39ad8cc7d2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Manchester United have made their worst start to a Premier League season after Monday night's 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford.</p>\n    <p><b>Pressure points:</b> The pressure has built on Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r as United have taken only nine points from their first seven games \u2013 just enough for them to squeak in to the top half of the table. United have won only once since their opening 4-0 victory over Chelsea, with Marcus Rashford's penalty earning them a 1-0 home win against Leicester.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Fall from grace:</b>&nbsp;It is just two years since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho oversaw United's joint-best start to a Premier League season. United claimed 19 points from their first seven games in 2017-18, equalling the starts made by Sir Alex Ferguson's sides in 1999-2000 and 2011-12. United finished runners-up under Mourinho that season, but a whopping 19 points adrift of champions Manchester City.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Ole at the wheel:</b> The figures make bleak reading for Solskj\u00e6r when comparing the Norwegian's record with his predecessors. Mourinho \u2013 who would be sacked in December \u2013 made a poor start last season, but his 10-point haul from the first seven games was still one more than Solskj\u00e6r has managed 12 months on. David Moyes also took 10 points from his first seven games in the 2013-14 season, while Louis van Gaal won 11 and 16 points in the respective 2014-15 and 2015-16 campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>30-year low:</b> The last time United made such a poor start to a campaign was under Ferguson in the days of the old First Division. United picked up only seven points from their first seven games of the 1989-90 season, a run that brought successive defeats to Derby, Norwich and Everton and ended with a famous 5-1 thrashing by Manchester City at Maine Road. United ended up 13th that season, but lifted the FA Cup as Ferguson won his first trophy in England. <b>PA Media</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a lesson, perhaps, for De Gea and all the goalkeepers in this league that the officials cannot always be trusted now the rules have changed.</p> \n<p>For Solskj\u00e6r the disappointment was compounded by the fact the equaliser came from Axel Tuanzebe, playing at left-back for United on a night when they were missing both first-choice full-backs, making a wretched pass inside his own half to lose possession and give Bukayo Saka the opportunity to feed Aubameyang.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fe951bbf7410f75fceb42ae47fd1a79bdd3064c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fe951bbf7410f75fceb42ae47fd1a79bdd3064c/0_88_2859_1716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott McTominay fires in the opening goal just before half-time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott McTominay fires in the opening goal just before half-time.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was that kind of night and, in the worst moments, it was remarkable to think these were supposedly elite teams.</p> \n<p>For Arsenal it must have been a cause for anguish that McTominay\u2019s goal could be traced back to one of their own corners. Arsenal looked vulnerable as soon as their opponents started streaming out of their own penalty area. In a rare moment of nostalgia, United had managed to turn defence into attack in a few seconds. Daniel James could not produce a telling cross but Marcus Rashford chased the ball towards the corner flag and then cut it back for McTominay to let fly. He struck the ball beautifully and the shot was still rising as it hit the net.</p> \n<p>McTominay, though, must also feel he could have won the match, at 1-1, when he had a golden opportunity to score from a header.</p> \n<p>Until his goal the first half had been a grind. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 put Arsenal\u2019s first real chance into the Stretford End when he had more time than he probably realised.

      "bodyText": "Such is life for the modern Manchester United that the first point to make is that their supporters no longer need to check the bottom half of the Premier League table to find their team. This result lifts them from 11th to 10th, just above the jagged line. It is still not where they want to be \u2013 but Arsenal did enough, ultimately, to warrant a point from a thud-and-blunder evening that demonstrated how far these old rivals have to go before they can harbour realistic title ambitions. On this evidence it is going to be a long way back. Scott McTominay did score a peach of a goal for United but, last season included, the difficult truth for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is that his team have not managed more than one goal in 11 of their last 12 league fixtures. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang supplied Arsenal\u2019s equaliser after VAR had overturned a rotten offside decision and, points-wise, it is the first time since the 1989-90 season that United have not reached double figures from their first seven games. That is the same season, it may be recalled, that Old Trafford chanted for Bryan Robson to take over and a banner appeared in the stands calling for Alex Ferguson, then just a plain old Mister, to be removed from office. This time the crowd is nothing like as grumpy. The weather is still the same, of course, although it would probably be a bit too generous on the two sets of players to blame the near-unremitting Mancunian downpour for their inability to pass the ball more stylishly. It was an accident-prone evening, littered with clumsiness, and it told a clear story about why these sides are already playing catch-up to Liverpool and Manchester City in the top two positions. Nobody should realistically expect them to win that chase. Not that the lack of real quality \u2013 and it was startling at times \u2013 stopped the game from burning slowly into an entertaining contest. The first half, in truth, was a bit of a stinker. Or at least it was until McTominay grew weary of the torpor and, 20 yards out, smacked in a firecracker of a shot. After that, however, there was lots of drama and incident at either end, not least the equalising goal when Aubameyang was initially judged to be offside in the moments before he flicked the ball over David de Gea. It turned out to be a particularly poor judgment from a trigger-happy linesman and possibly the easiest VAR decision yet. Harry Maguire had been playing Aubameyang onside by some distance. United did have a reasonable argument De Gea would have made more of an effort to block the shot had he not seen the raised flag. It was a lesson, perhaps, for De Gea and all the goalkeepers in this league that the officials cannot always be trusted now the rules have changed. For Solskj\u00e6r the disappointment was compounded by the fact the equaliser came from Axel Tuanzebe, playing at left-back for United on a night when they were missing both first-choice full-backs, making a wretched pass inside his own half to lose possession and give Bukayo Saka the opportunity to feed Aubameyang. It was that kind of night and, in the worst moments, it was remarkable to think these were supposedly elite teams. For Arsenal it must have been a cause for anguish that McTominay\u2019s goal could be traced back to one of their own corners. Arsenal looked vulnerable as soon as their opponents started streaming out of their own penalty area. In a rare moment of nostalgia, United had managed to turn defence into attack in a few seconds. Daniel James could not produce a telling cross but Marcus Rashford chased the ball towards the corner flag and then cut it back for McTominay to let fly. He struck the ball beautifully and the shot was still rising as it hit the net. McTominay, though, must also feel he could have won the match, at 1-1, when he had a golden opportunity to score from a header. Until his goal the first half had been a grind. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 put Arsenal\u2019s first real chance into the Stretford End when he had more time than he probably realised. Andreas Pereira tried to liven up proceedings with a shot that Bernd Leno saved down to his left. The away end chanted for VAR after a cross thudded into McTominay\u2019s chest. The rain fell hard on a humdrum game. And at that stage United\u2019s best hope appeared to be high ball into the penalty area and someone getting on the end of one of Maguire\u2019s knockdowns. It was poor in the extreme and, unfortunately for Granit Xhaka, his first game since being named as Arsenal\u2019s full-time captain contained an element of tragicomedy. For Example A, consider his ability, at 0-0, to make a pig\u2019s ear from a free-kick in a promising position. More damagingly for Arsenal, however, Xhaka was also culpable of ducking out of the way of McTominay\u2019s shot. The only possible mitigation was the ball took a tiny nick off another Arsenal player. Xhaka\u2019s head was down, his eyes fixed on the floor, and the ball was spearing into the roof of the net. It was the kind of moment that might wake Tony Adams, Martin Keown et al during the early hours in a cold sweat.

      "bodyText": "Violent and sex offenders in England and Wales will no longer be automatically released halfway through their jail sentence under government plans that will increase the prison population by about 3,000. Nearly all offenders \u2013 92% in 2018 \u2013 sentenced to immediate custody are released at the midway point on licence in the community under rules introduced in 2005. As part of a tough-on-crime agenda dismissed as populist electioneering by critics, the justice secretary has announced that offenders guilty of violent and sexual crimes that carry a maximum sentence of life \u2013 such as manslaughter, rape, grievous bodily harm \u2013 and who are sentenced to at least four years in prison will be required to serve two-thirds of the sentence in prison before being released on licence. Since becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson and his government have attempted to make a hardline approach to criminal justice a central plank of their domestic agenda. The overhaul of automatic release follows a wave of forceful rhetoric and justice-focused announcements, including increased use of stop and search, more police officers on the streets and a review of sentencing. Johnson\u2019s government also announced plans to create 10,000 prison places \u2013 3,000 of which will be eaten up by the impact of the policy to end automatic release at the midway point. Penal reform campaigners called the change \u201ccomplicated and unnecessary fiddling\u201d. In his speech on Tuesday, Robert Buckland, the justice secretary and lord chancellor, will say: \u201cWe\u2019re going to restore faith in the sentencing system because we Conservatives believe release should be earned.

So we will do more to improve rehabilitation in prison and support our probation services in their vital work to supervise and resettle former prisoners.\u201d In 2018, of the 77,485 adults sentenced to immediate custody, 92% received a standard determinate sentence, all of whom are automatically released at the halfway point of their sentence. Johnson and Buckland announced plans to spend up to \u00a32.5bn on creating new prisons, while an extra \u00a3100m will be spent on cracking down on crime within prisons.

This is not because the hundreds of thousands who backed the protests have suddenly changed their view on Beijing\u2019s devious efforts to deepen its control. Rather, in Washington, London and other capitals, it\u2019s plain that money and power speak louder than democratic ideals, broken umbrellas and bloodied heads.

One of their eggs hatched on Sunday, with another cracking open early Monday, developments tracked on an almost minute-by-minute basis by the 4,000 members of the 367 Collins Falcon Watchers Facebook group, which monitors the birds via a live stream video feed. \u201cAmazing passage of play there,\u201d wrote one appreciative member on Monday morning. \u201cMum got up and went away for about 90 secs, coming back with fresh pigeon for morning tea.\u201d The post neatly captures the experience of the live stream, which rather resembles Test match cricket, with long periods of meditative tedium interspersed with bursts of frantic excitement.</p> <p>Still, in 2018, many falcon fans were traumatised when only one of the chicks survived. The others slowly sickened and eventually died. In drought conditions, the birds become susceptible to a protozoa they contract from eating the brains of starlings and pigeons, explains Dr Victor Hurley, the volunteer leader of the Victorian Peregrine Project. And that\u2019s why he avoids naming particular chicks: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/01/peregrine-falcon-chicks-hatch-in-melbourne-as-facebook-fans-watch-on\">because personalising them makes their deaths even more distressing</a>.</p> <h2>Media roundup</h2> <p>Kurdish authorities are requesting that the Australian government <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-01/kurds-plead-with-australia-to-take-back-islamic-state-families/11560338\">repatriate dozens of citizens who lived under Islamic State and who are now held in camps and jails in Syria</a>, the <strong>ABC</strong> reports.

Instead, they offered spineless servitude, writes Simon Tisdall: \u201cIf Hong Kong\u2019s battle for democracy \u2013 meaning universal suffrage, direct elections, civil rights, free speech and observance of the rule of law \u2013 has not already been lost, it is teetering on the brink. This is not because the hundreds of thousands who backed the protests have suddenly changed their view on Beijing\u2019s devious efforts to deepen its control. Rather, in Washington, London and other capitals, it\u2019s plain that money and power speak louder than democratic ideals, broken umbrellas and bloodied heads. If Hong Kong is permanently, definitively lost to democracy, it will be, at least in part, because the west failed to fight for it.\u201d Sport A decade ago, Cadel Evans became the first Australian to win the UCI Road World Championships road race. Last week, Canberra\u2019s Michael Matthews travelled to Yorkshire hoping to replicate that feat, and Guardian Australia was there with him. The lack of competitiveness of many pool games is one of the Rugby World Cup\u2019s ongoing weaknesses. The All Blacks in particular are unlikely to be too severely tested in their remaining three group stage outings. So, Matt McILraith asks, what can the defending world champions hope to gain? Thinking time: tracking Melbourne\u2019s peregrine falcon chicks The peregrine falcons at 367 Collins Street in Melbourne\u2019s city centre have hatched a new brood of chicks. One of their eggs hatched on Sunday, with another cracking open early Monday, developments tracked on an almost minute-by-minute basis by the 4,000 members of the 367 Collins Falcon Watchers Facebook group, which monitors the birds via a live stream video feed. \u201cAmazing passage of play there,\u201d wrote one appreciative member on Monday morning. \u201cMum got up and went away for about 90 secs, coming back with fresh pigeon for morning tea.\u201d The post neatly captures the experience of the live stream, which rather resembles Test match cricket, with long periods of meditative tedium interspersed with bursts of frantic excitement. Still, in 2018, many falcon fans were traumatised when only one of the chicks survived. The others slowly sickened and eventually died. In drought conditions, the birds become susceptible to a protozoa they contract from eating the brains of starlings and pigeons, explains Dr Victor Hurley, the volunteer leader of the Victorian Peregrine Project. And that\u2019s why he avoids naming particular chicks: because personalising them makes their deaths even more distressing. Media roundup Kurdish authorities are requesting that the Australian government repatriate dozens of citizens who lived under Islamic State and who are now held in camps and jails in Syria, the ABC reports. The Sydney Morning Herald reports the Berejiklian government in NSW is expected to scrap Sydney\u2019s CBD lockout laws by the end of the year. And the Australian reports that China\u2019s ambassador, Cheng Jingye, has said that Australia should remember that it depends on China for its economic success. Coming up The Reserve Bank will hold its monthly board meeting to decide on the cash rate, with implications for borrowers, savers and the overall economy. The market has priced in a strong chance of a 0.25 percentage point cut to 0.75%.

The US president is facing an impeachment inquiry that could remove him from office, precisely because of his relentless pursuit of conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Here are the five such theories that lie at the heart of the Ukraine scandal:</p> <h2>1. Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor, to shield his son Hunter</h2> <p>This goes right to the core of the impeachment inquiry, as it speaks to the \u201curgent concern\u201d raised by a whistleblower in the intelligence services. According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/26/whistleblower-trump-ukraine-read-in-full-text-document\">whistleblower\u2019s complaint, </a>Trump repeatedly urged the Ukrainian government to investigate the former vice-president, in the hope of gathering dirt on someone who stands a good chance of contesting next year\u2019s presidential election.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s theory begins with a truth: in 2016 Biden withheld $1bn in loan guarantees from Ukraine in order to winkle out its then chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. The prosecutor, Trump\u2019s story goes on less accurately, was busily investigating Hunter Biden, the vice-president\u2019s second son, who was a paid board member of a large Ukrainian gas company, Burisma.</p> <p>Two and two makes five: Joe Biden, Trump concluded, was corruptly interfering in Ukraine in order to protect his son.</p> <p>There are problems with this narrative. The Burisma investigation was dormant when Biden pushed for Shokin to be fired. And Biden was not alone in wanting Shokin out: several European governments and authorities including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/world/europe/political-stability-in-the-balance-as-ukraine-ousts-top-prosecutor.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\">the IMF</a> also pressed for his dismissal, because of his dire record on fighting corruption.</p> <h2>2. Hunter Biden was up to his neck in corruption</h2> <p>There is no doubt the younger Biden\u2019s appointment at Burisma in April 2014 was curious, to put it politely. He had no expertise in the gas industry and it is hard to avoid the thought his main attraction was his bloodline.</p> <p>But the move was not illegal and his father has stated that the pair never discussed business. In May, the then prosecutor general of Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-16/ukraine-prosecutor-says-no-evidence-of-wrongdoing-by-bidens\">told Bloomberg</a> there was no evidence either Biden did anything wrong.</p> <p>Then, as now, there was no law or regulation preventing children or other relatives of powerful public figures pursuing lucrative business opportunities.</p> <p>Ask Billy Carter, brother of Jimmy Carter; Hillary Clinton\u2019s brothers, Tony and Hugh Rodham; and George W Bush\u2019s brother Neil.

Before the introduction of the national living wage (in 2016), over one in five workers across Britain (20.7%, or 5.5 million workers in total) were in low-paid work, a figure which has now fallen to 17.1 per cent (or 4.7 million workers).

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Around 4m people will benefit from the two aspects of the policy, according to Treasury sources.</strong> It is estimated that on average the increase will be worth \u00a34,000 a year to those affected by the time it comes into force.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The national living wage is currently set at \u00a38.21 an hour. </strong>This is equivalent to 60% of median earnings. Sajid Javid\u2019s plan is to raise this to 66% of median earnings by 2024, which is forecast to take it to \u00a310.50 an hour. Without the increase from 60% to 66%, the forecast would be for the national living wage to be worth \u00a39.55 by 2024.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Javid also plans to lower the age limit at which people can get the national living wage, a policy introduced by George Osborne when he was chancellor.</strong> The national living wage was a beefed-up minimum wage for people aged 25 and over. Younger worker were kept on the minimum wage, which is currently \u00a37.70 for over-21s and \u00a36.15 for over-18s. The national living wage is not the same as<a href=\"https://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-real-living-wage\"> the Living Wage Foundation\u2019s living wage</a>, a voluntary rage for employers committed to decent pay, set at \u00a310.55 an hour in London and \u00a39 an hour outside London.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Javid will reduce the age limit for the national living wage in two stages. </strong>From 2021 it will go down to 23, so that people aged 23 and over get it. By 2024 it will go down to 21, so that people aged 21 and over qualify. This will require changes to secondary legislation. Increasing the national living wage does not require legislation because the low pay commission proposes the rate, in accordance with guidance from government.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Treasury has not produced a figure for how much this will cost employers, or the government, but sources insist that the impact will be relatively minor.</strong> They argue that the proposals are balanced, that they are being phased in over time, and that employers understand the case for a higher minimum wage.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9211668f081108db9bf76d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-30T14:33:34.974Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Javid says workers will get national living wage over age of 21, not at 25</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Javid also says the Tories will lower the age at which people can get the national living wage.

In fact, the first speech I ever covered by a politician, when I was a trainee reporter on the South Wales Echo in 1990, involved Peter Walker, the then Welsh secretary, speaking about how Britain needed to copy Germany\u2019s expertise in vocational and technical educational. Walker\u2019s speech (which was much better than Williamson\u2019s) made the point that Germany had been a pioneer in this field since the late 19th century.

He argues that a no-deal Brexit would be an unusual economic shock because as well as restricting demand (which supports the case for a rate cut), it may restrict supply too (which could strengthen the case for a rate rise). <strong>Chris Giles,</strong> the FT\u2019s economics editor, thinks the bank will not be happy with what Javid said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/1178571526762827777\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Javid\u2019s suggestion that BoE will act to stimulate the economy after a no deal Brexit is:<br><br>a) true<br>b) likely to go down like a bucket of cold sick in BoE, which has studiously said rates could go in either direction</p>\u2014 Chris Giles (@ChrisGiles_) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/1178571526762827777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Javid implied the government has a plan to bypass the Benn Act, which is designed to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal on 31 October.</strong> Today\u2019s Nick Robinson said he did not expect Javid to tell him how the government might get round this, because the prime minister himself has refused to answer this question.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: The prime minister came under increasing pressure over allegations of sexual impropriety. Boris Johnson\u2019s former cabinet colleague, Justine Greening, described the claims as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and current ministers, including Johnson, spent much of the day fending off questions on the subject. The Tories will aim to raise the \u201cnational living wage\u201d to \u00a310.50 an hour, the chancellor said. Sajid Javid announced the aspiration during his conference speech on Monday. Labour attacked it as a \u201cpathetic attempt at catch-up\u201d, while the Federation of Small Businesses said the plan could make some small businesses unviable. Johnson would be dismissed by the Queen if he ignored a court order to implement the law requiring him to ask for a Brexit delay, it was claimed. Dominic Grieve, one of the MPs involved in drafting the Benn act, said the legislation is robust and that ministers will not find loopholes in it, amid speculation No 10 believes it has found a way through it. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues Rowena Mason, Kate Proctor and Heather Stewart have this: The UK\u2019s proposal for dealing with the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic includes the creation of a series of customs posts either side and a few miles back from the border itself, according to a report by Ireland\u2019s RT\u00c9 News. The outlet says it has seen extracts of documents produced in London and that the proposals also include the idea of monitoring the movement of goods from one \u201ccustoms clearance site\u201d to another using GPS via mobile phone data, or tracking devices placed on trucks or vans. The report, which the Guardian has not independently verified, reads: Under the British proposals, both the UK and EU would create what are believed to be called \u2018customs clearance sites\u2019, but to all intents and purposes a customs post. Traders would have a choice of either a straightforward customs declaration which would have to be lodged and cleared on either side of the border, or the so-called \u2018transit\u2019 system. Under a transit scheme, the exporter becomes a registered \u2018consigner\u2019 at base, and the importer becomes a registered \u2018consignee\u2019. The method requires a bond from a financial institution to guarantee that the relevant customs duty, excise and VAT have been paid and that the goods do not go illegally off the beaten track en route. According to RT\u00c9 News, senior political figures on the island have already dismissed the ideas. At the fringe event, the denunciation of the government by some of its former members goes on: The shadow culture secretary, Labour\u2019s Tom Watston, has welcomed the reversal of the BBC\u2019s decision to partially uphold a complaint against the presenter, Naga Munchetty: This is the right decision. I\u2019m glad the complaint against Naga Munchetty has been overturned. She was right to give her interpretation of Trump\u2019s language based on her experiences as a woman of colour. Calling out racism takes courage. The ruling against her was wrong and I hope the BBC reviews the process that led to it. You can read more on that here: Labour\u2019s plans to secure cheaper medicines for the NHS through a system of \u201cvoluntary and compulsory licensing\u201d would \u201cput lives at risk,\u201d the health secretary has claimed. At Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton last week, Jeremy Corbyn said his government would use a system of voluntary and compulsory licensing to procure cheaper versions of patented drugs. Corbyn said Labour would \u201ctell the drugs companies that if they want public research funding then they\u2019ll have to make their drugs affordable for all\u201d. He also announced plans in the longer term to create a publicly-owned generic drugs manufacturer to lower prices for the NHS and fund \u201csocially valuable and challenging\u201d research into antimicrobial resistance which is less profitable for pharmaceutical companies. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said Labour\u2019s plans amounted to the nationalisation of parts of the pharmaceutical industry. I think that the announcement to essentially nationalise parts of the drugs supply would ultimately lead to fewer drugs being available and less innovation and that ultimately would not only damage our life sciences industry and the economic damage that comes with that but I think it would put lives at risk. Hancock said intellectual property - such as that for the creation of new medicines - is the \u201cproperty right of the 21st century\u201d and undermining it risks \u201cundermining industry\u201d. A veteran of Boris Johnson\u2019s political campaigns has resigned as a Downing Street political adviser as tensions rise between former Vote Leave members and ex-City Hall factions around No 10. Alex Crowley, who worked on Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign, two mayoral campaigns and wrote a book about him, quit last week. His exit came as several sources with knowledge of No 10 suggested that there was an atmosphere of feuding inside Johnson\u2019s administration. The former justice secretary, David Gauke, has been saying that \u2013 while he is himself a Eurosceptic \u2013 he fears a no-deal Brexit and that the UK\u2019s approach has been fundamentally wrong: Here\u2019s a little more on that fringe event, where the former minister Alistair Burt has been telling an audience he does not need lessons on loyalty to the Tory party. Burt, along with Dominic Grieve and David Gauke, who are also appearing, had the whip withdrawn after voting against the government earlier this month. The Guardian has just published a leader on Labour\u2019s universal credit policy, concluding that the \u201cplan makes sense\u201d. The shocking failings of universal credit are justly blamed on the government having listened to the wrong people when setting it up. The sensible reforms set out by Labour show that the opposition has been listening to the right ones. Never mind that the package of changes announced by Jeremy Corbyn on Saturday was misleadingly described as a plan to \u201cscrap\u201d universal credit. His party\u2019s proposals to end the five-week wait for initial payments, scrap the benefit cap and two-child limit (and heinous \u201crape clause\u201d) are sound. So are promises to review the sanctions system, ditch the \u201cdigital only\u201d approach and hire 5,000 new advisers to help those who struggle with online applications. The army\u2019s zero-tolerance drugs policy has been scrapped less than a year after it was introduced, the defence secretary has confirmed. Speaking at a ConservativeHome fringe event at the Conservative party conference in Manchester, Ben Wallace told Tory members he had changed the policy because it should be for commanding officers, and not the government, to decide to strip an individual of their job. Wallace\u2019s predecessor, Gavin Williamson, brought in the policy in November 2018 in an effort to ensure high standards are maintained. Williamson said drug-taking was incompatible with the armed forces, and that a zero-tolerance approach was the only way to ensure excellence was maintained across the UK\u2019s world-class military. But Wallace has suggested young officers who mistakenly took drugs should be offered a second chance. I changed it. I took the view that some people are young and irresponsible and it should be up to their commanding officers to decide, whether it\u2019s a young lad or girl who\u2019s made a mistake, whether they should be allowed to remain in the armed forces or not. And people who have left and want to rejoin, the same should apply to them as well. I think, you know, that doesn\u2019t mean to say you should be able to do drugs in the armed forces. When pushed on what limits would be imposed, Wallace added that individuals should be allowed to remain in the army \u201cif it is appropriate\u201d. He said: It should be up to commanding officers to understand their workforce, to understand whether that individual is the problem, or if there\u2019s a medical problem and they think they need help, or whether indeed it was a mistake. Some of the 21 MPs to have had the Conservative whip withdrawn earlier this month are holding an event on the fringes of Tory party conference: Signs have emerged that the hardline position of the Conservative party\u2019s most Eurosceptic backbenchers has softened just days before Boris Johnson\u2019s team are due to enter a \u201ctunnel\u201d of secret negotiations with Brussels. Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, has opened the door to a potential Brexit deal, indicating he would look at one even if it included a version of the controversial Irish border backstop to which the Eurosceptic ERG was once implacably opposed. During a heated and sometimes bad-tempered event on the party conference fringe, he indicated that the so-called \u201cSpartan\u201d wing of the party was in the mood for a deal. Referring to the bloc of 28 backbenchers who voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal three times, he said: It has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That\u2019s not true. If there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully, because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. So I\u2019ll look at a deal if there is one. An anti-abortion billboard targeted at the Labour MP Stella Creasy, who is pregnant, has been removed amid claims the campaign amounted to harassment. The owner of the billboard, the advertising agency Clear Channel, apologised and said it was taking immediate action to remove them. The Walthamstow MP said she was being targeted by the anti-abortion group, CBRUK, because she is pro-choice. She posted an image of the billboard online, asking the agency how much they had been paid for hosting it. Later that day, the billboard appeared to have been painted over. Creasy has asked the company to donate the fee made from the billboard to an abortion support charity. She also criticised the Met police\u2019s refusal to intervene. Clear Channel wrote online: A spokesman for the Advertising Standards Agency said: Clear Channel have taken the decision to remove the ad. Therefore we will not be taking any further action at this point. This is from my colleague Graeme Wearden on the UQ in the Commons this afternoon on the Brexit and currency speculation. The UK government has refused to launch an inquiry into its links to financial speculators who are accused of shorting UK assets to profit from a disorderly departure from the EU. Treasury minister Simon Clarke has tried to rebut claims, from former chancellor Philip Hammond, that Boris Johnson\u2019s hedge fund backers would win \u201cbillions of pounds\u201d from a no-deal Brexit. But several MPs have warned that Boris Johnson faces a conflict of interest, having taken money from investors who have shorted UK companies and could be speculating heavily against the pound. Answering an urgent question on Hammond\u2019s allegations, Clarke claimed that such theories were \u201cmore fit for the tin-foil-hat brigade\u201d. He insisted that the pound should be free to float, and accused critics of \u201cselling this country short\u201d. Claims that investors who backed Johnson, or the leave campaign, would win billions from the collapse of sterling were simply wrong, Clarke insisted. And he told several MPs that the best way to avoid a no-deal Brexit was to support efforts to leave with a good deal. But opposition MPs fear that City speculators are hoping to profit from a disorderly Brexit - as the Treasury\u2019s former top civil servant, Nick Macpherson, has warned. Labour\u2019s Tracey Brabin said it was simply immoral for speculators to profit from the pain and disruption that a no-deal Brexit would cause. There is more on Graeme\u2019s business live blog. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has said that if the Tories deliver Brexit by 31 October, the threat from the Brexit party will vanish. At the \u201cStand up for Brexit\u201d fringe he said: If we deliver Brexit on 31 October then [the Brexit party\u2019s] job is done. If we don\u2019t do what we must do by 31 October, then they will be a real force threatening us. So there is no deal to be done, there is delivery to be done. If we deliver, we win and if we don\u2019t, we lose. And it\u2019s as simple as that and if you don\u2019t believe me the person who puts this most clearly is the great Dominic Cummings, to whom we should all be enormously grateful. At the same meeting Steve Baker, chair of the European Research Group, said the Brexit party had one goal and that was to take the UK out of the European Union. He went on: There are many, many good Conservatives in the Brexit party. There\u2019s even a Rees-Mogg [Annunziata, Jacob\u2019s sister, an MEP]. Richard Tice [now MEP for the east of England] was on the candidate list for us and could easily have been our mayoral candidate in London. There are some really, really excellent Conservatives in the Brexit party and I just want them to come home. Asked about the prospects for a deal with the EU, Rees-Mogg said: I think it can be won if the deal that is brought back is, as anticipated, considerably better than the one that we had before, with the question of the Irish backstop dealt with. And if the DUP are persuaded and if Steve is persuaded, then I think we are very, very close to a majority in parliament. I think if we get the deal we will get the majority in parliament, partly because I think we are all fed up of this. And here is some business reaction to the national living wage announcement. From Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general Business shares the chancellor\u2019s ambition to end low pay. Increasing productivity is the only way to sustainable pay rises. The success of the independent low pay commission has been its evidence-based approach to increasing wages without damaging job prospects. The commission will work best if it retains the ability to judge the pace and affordability of any future wage rises. From Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce The government\u2019s ambition to raise and simplify the national living wage is laudable but the path to doing so must be on the basis of clear economic evidence, with ample time for businesses to adjust to any changes. Companies already face significant cumulative employment costs, including pensions auto-enrolment, immigration skills charge and the apprenticeship levy, so government must take action to alleviate the heavy cost-burden facing firms, or risk denting productivity and competitiveness. These are from Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, on the national living wage announcement. These are from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates. The Federation of Small Businesses has said that Sajid Javid\u2019s national living wage increase could put some small firms out of business. Its national chairman, Mike Cherry, said in a statement: While it is welcome that the chancellor is giving businesses five years to adapt, this increase will leave many small employers struggling and, without help, could make some small firms unviable. Those in sectors with tight margins and which are heavily labour-dependent, such as the care sector, retail or hospitality, will be particularly badly hit without support. Four in ten small employers say operating costs are rising due to employment costs. The chancellor must now find ways to help those smaller businesses to meet his ambition, without deterring them from expanding and hiring more employees. We are suggesting to the government that it should uprate the Employment Allowance introduced by George Osborne to bring down the costs of employment, together with a national Insurance holiday for those that recruit those furthest from work \u2013 as promised in the 2017 Conservative manifesto. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston And here is Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, on the national living wage announcement. The TUC has long campaigned for a minimum wage of over \u00a310, and an end to the discrimination young workers suffer from lower rates. But the chancellor\u2019s pre-election promise should be taken with a huge bucket of salt. This pledge would be overwhelmed by a no-deal Brexit. If we leave the EU without a deal, jobs will be lost, wages will fall, and our public services will suffer. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has dismissed Sajid Javid\u2019s national living wage announcement as a \u201cpathetic attempt at catch-up\u201d. He explained: This pathetic attempt at catch-up by the Conservatives will fool nobody. Labour will introduce \u00a310 as a minimum as soon as we take office and, rising with living costs, it will mean everybody over 16 years of age will be earning comfortably more than \u00a310.50 an hour by 2024. Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto promised a real living wage of at least \u00a310 an hour for all workers over 16 by 2020. The party says, based on the expected inflation rate, by 2024 that would be worth \u00a310.81. The Resolution Foundation, a thinktank specialising in low pay, has welcomed Sajid Javid\u2019s plan to increase the value of the national living wage and widen its scope. Here is an extract from its news release. The chancellor\u2019s plan to eliminate low pay over the next five years \u2013 by raising the national living wage (NLW) to reach two-thirds of typical hourly pay \u2013 is hugely ambitious and will need to be implemented carefully, the Resolution Foundation said today ... The foundation says that achieving this would mark a dramatic turnaround for Britain\u2019s low pay landscape. Before the introduction of the national living wage (in 2016), over one in five workers across Britain (20.7%, or 5.5 million workers in total) were in low-paid work, a figure which has now fallen to 17.1 per cent (or 4.7 million workers). Aiming to abolish low pay entirely represents a significant increase in ambition. Raising the NLW to \u00a310.50 in 2024 would see a worker (aged 25+) on the wage floor earn around 70p an hour more than they would have done if the previous plans for the NLW had been maintained \u2013 equivalent to an extra \u00a31,400 a year for a full-time worker. The \u00a31.400 a year average gain quoted by the Resolution Foundation is considerably less than the \u00a34,000 a year average gain quoted by Treasury sources (see 4.23pm), but that figure included those gaining because the age at which the national living wage is paid is coming down from 25 to 21. Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, the Tory caucus pushing for a harder Brexit, has opened the door to a potential vote in favour of a deal that could include an Irish border backstop. Francois said during a heated debate on the future of Brexit that the ERG would be the first to sign off a deal if it meant a genuine exit from all the institutions of the EU. He said: It has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That\u2019s not true. If there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. I\u2019ll look at a deal if there is one, but as I think I said my acid test will be, does it mean we genuinely leave the EU? I want nothing more than to see the sun rise on the 1 November on a free country. Explaining the conditions under which he would consider supporting deal, Francois said: It rather depends what\u2019s in it. As a so-called Spartan, if it means we genuinely leave the EU, if it means we genuinely leave on Halloween, I will be the first in the Aye lobby. But if it did not mean that, then he would vote against it, Francois said, \u201cand no amount of brow beating will make me change my mind.\u201d In Manchester officials have been briefing on the chancellor\u2019s plans to increase the value of the national living wage. Here are the main points. Around 4m people will benefit from the two aspects of the policy, according to Treasury sources. It is estimated that on average the increase will be worth \u00a34,000 a year to those affected by the time it comes into force. The national living wage is currently set at \u00a38.21 an hour. This is equivalent to 60% of median earnings. Sajid Javid\u2019s plan is to raise this to 66% of median earnings by 2024, which is forecast to take it to \u00a310.50 an hour. Without the increase from 60% to 66%, the forecast would be for the national living wage to be worth \u00a39.55 by 2024. Javid also plans to lower the age limit at which people can get the national living wage, a policy introduced by George Osborne when he was chancellor. The national living wage was a beefed-up minimum wage for people aged 25 and over. Younger worker were kept on the minimum wage, which is currently \u00a37.70 for over-21s and \u00a36.15 for over-18s. The national living wage is not the same as the Living Wage Foundation\u2019s living wage, a voluntary rage for employers committed to decent pay, set at \u00a310.55 an hour in London and \u00a39 an hour outside London. Javid will reduce the age limit for the national living wage in two stages. From 2021 it will go down to 23, so that people aged 23 and over get it. By 2024 it will go down to 21, so that people aged 21 and over qualify. This will require changes to secondary legislation. Increasing the national living wage does not require legislation because the low pay commission proposes the rate, in accordance with guidance from government. The Treasury has not produced a figure for how much this will cost employers, or the government, but sources insist that the impact will be relatively minor. They argue that the proposals are balanced, that they are being phased in over time, and that employers understand the case for a higher minimum wage. Javid also says the Tories will lower the age at which people can get the national living wage. At the moment it is paid to people aged 25 and over. And to help the next generation of go-getters to get ahead \u2026 \u2026 we will reward the hard work of all millennials too\u2026 by bringing down the age threshold for the national living wage\u2026 \u2026 to cover all workers over the age of 21. Javid says the Tories will aim to raise the \u201cnational living wage\u201d to \u00a310.50 an hour In 2016, we introduced the national living wage... Giving Britain\u2019s workers the biggest pay rise in two decades. In April, we increased the rate again \u2026 \u2026 making 1.8 million workers better off \u2026 Putting the number of low-paid workers at its lowest level in four decades. Today, I\u2019m delighted to announce that we will take this much further. Over the next five years, we will make the UK one of the first major economies in the world to end low pay altogether. To do that, I am setting a new target for the national living wage: raising it to match two-thirds of median earnings. That means, on current forecasts, this ambitious plan will bring the national living wage up to \u00a310.50. Giving 4 million people a well-earned pay rise. Javid announces a \u00a3500m youth investment fund. This ambitious \u00a3500m programme will roll out youth centres and services right across our country\u2026 \u2026 helping millions more young people get on the conveyor belt to a better life and career. Javid announces a further white paper on devolution. So I can announce today we will bring forward a white paper on further devolution in England. Giving more local areas more local powers\u2026 \u2026 to drive investments in the infrastructure and services they know they need. We already have four brilliant Conservative metro mayors\u2026 Let\u2019s get one in Manchester too! Javid praises Ruth Davidson, the former Tory leader in Scotland. She was one of his biggest supporters, but she has not been mentioned by other ministers on the conference platform. (She resigned partly because she disapproved of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy.) Javid turns to buses - a subject he said this morning had been long neglected by Whitehall. (See 9.18am.) Now buses .... \u2026 they haven\u2019t been given the attention they deserve from politicians\u2026 \u2026 but they are still the backbone of our public transport in most of the country. Well, not only do you have a chancellor with a well-known family connection to buses\u2026 \u2026 but a PM who likes to paint them! At the spending round we allocated \u00a3220m to buses alone. This will form part of a national bus strategy next year. Rolling out new \u2018superbus\u2019 networks\u2026 \u2026 expanding our fleet of low-emission buses\u2026 \u2026 and delivering better value for money for passengers. And last but not least, connecting us to the modern, global digital economy with gigabit broadband. Javid promises an infrastructure revolution. Successive governments failed to invest enough for the long term. We\u2019ve started to put that right, but we can do more, a lot more. This government is going to build Britain\u2019s future, and bring in a new infrastructure revolution. He is confirming the proposals briefed overnight. My colleague Peter Walker wrote them up here. Javid stresses his commitment to public services, saying they will be at the heart of the government\u2019s agenda. For me, like so many others around the country\u2026 \u2026 public services were my lifelines. The teachers who made my career possible. The police officers who kept us safe when the street I grew up on became a centre for drug dealers. The NHS that cared for my dad in his final days. These aren\u2019t just numbers on a spreadsheet - they are the beating heart of our country. That\u2019s why public services are at the heart of this government\u2019s agenda. Javid announces plans for a Brexit red tape challenge. As we look towards a future outside the EU\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019m very optimistic we can build on our extraordinary economic strengths \u2026 \u2026 and reshape the British economy to seize the opportunities that this new chapter has to offer. We\u2019ll be able to pursue a genuinely independent trade policy. We\u2019ll be able to replace inefficient EU programmes with better, home-grown alternatives. And from retail to green tech, we\u2019ll have the opportunity to design smarter, more flexible regulation. To help us do that, I will launch a Brexit red tape challenge\u2026 \u2026 to help identify EU regulations that we can improve or remove. Liberating our entrepreneurs, small businesses and consumers\u2026. \u2026 from the burden of over-bearing bureaucracy, wherever we see it. Doing what a good pro-business government does. Javid says since 2010 the Conservatives have reduced the deficit. We may disagree on our approach on Brexit\u2026 \u2026 but as Conservatives we can be very proud of what they helped us to achieve. Labour left behind a bankrupt Britain - and we\u2019ve fixed it. Javid says Brexit is an opportunity to ask big questions about the future of the country. Jeremy Corbyn sees this as an opportunity to bring in nationalisation, protectionism and state control. Javid says international investors fears Labour more than they fear Brexit. If they [Labour] had their way, whole sectors of the economy would be renationalised. People\u2019s taxes would rise to the crippling levels of the past. People\u2019s jobs would be put at risk with sectoral pay bargaining. The return of trade union militancy would once again hold the government to ransom \u2026 \u2026 wasting hundreds of billions of pounds\u2026 \u2026 and hitting families and businesses around the country. The British Chambers of Commerce said last week that Labour\u2019s plans will \u201csend an icy chill up the spines of business owners and investors\u201d. And it\u2019s no wonder. We have a shadow chancellor who says businesses are \u201cthe real enemy\u201d\u2026 \u2026 and openly admits he wants to overthrow capitalism. Javid says there are millions of people who voted remain but who now just want to see Brexit delivered. He says the risks from not delivering Brexit are greater than the risks from Brexit. People talk a lot about the risks of Brexit. Some understandable, some not. But the truth is this \u2013 and it isn\u2019t acknowledged as often as it should be \u2013 the most reckless course of all would be to not deliver Brexit at all. If we fail to deliver on the instruction of the British people\u2026 \u2026 we are in danger of tearing the very fabric of our democracy. A fabric that has been carefully woven together over centuries. And if we do that, I fear we may not be able to stitch it up again. Javid turns to Labour. They\u2019re so split down the middle\u2026 \u2026 that even their leader and their shadow chancellor don\u2019t agree on whether they support Brexit. So they\u2019ll hold another referendum with two options: perhaps, and maybe. What a leader. A man for the many Brexit positions, not the few. Javid says this is ultimately a question about trust. Democracy is not just for when it suits you, he says. A strong economy can only be built on the foundation of a successful democracy. And by definition, democracy isn\u2019t just for when it suits you. Like the Lib Dems - who called for a referendum for years, then sort of changed their mind, then said they\u2019d respect the result, then sort of didn\u2019t, then called for a second vote, then changed their mind again\u2026 \u2026 and now want to somehow pretend the whole thing never happened. Going back on our promises to the British people isn\u2019t \u201cliberal\u201d, and it certainly isn\u2019t democratic. Javid says, deal or no deal, the UK will be ready. Javid says we are leaving the EU in 31 days - deal or no deal. Preparing to leave without a deal is not only the responsible thing to do, but the best way of getting a deal too. In all his years negotiating multi-million pound deals in the City, he never walked into a room without being able to walk away. That is why he has increased no-deal spending. And he has been able to guaranteed devolved administrations all the \u00a34.3bn of EU funding they were expecting under a deal (which involved a transition period). Sajid Javid is speaking now. He says his mother is here. Twenty years ago she thought it was a big deal when the first Asians moved into Coronation Street. Now she has seen the first Asians move into Downing Street. Once again, they are living above the shop. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is about to deliver his conference speech. From Sky\u2019s Europe correspondent Adam Parsons David Gauke, the former justice secretary and one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed for rebelling over Brexit, thinks Boris Johnson will get the blame if Brexit is delayed. But Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary and another of the 21 Brexit rebels, thinks Gauke is wrong. Whether Gauke is right or Stewart is right is one of the most important questions in British politics at the moment. It may decide the next election. Back in Westminster the opposition parties have ruled out calling a no confidence vote this week, Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said. This is from the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard. Like her colleagues, Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, used her conference speech to road test an attack line against Labour. Hers involved quoting what Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary, said about the plan to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2030. She said: We\u2019re working out the path to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We can do it, and we will help the world to do it. Contrast that to Labour who last week announced net zero by 2030! Total tosh! A perfect example of Labour promising something they can\u2019t deliver and don\u2019t understand. Unusually, I find myself agreeing with the GMB union, who\u2019s spokesman said, this \u2018threatens whole communities, threatens whole jobs \u2026 This means that within a decade people\u2019s petrol cars being confiscated. This will mean families can only take one flight every five years. Net zero carbon emissions by 2030 is utterly unachievable.\u2019 Well said, that man. Here is more from the Bruges Group fringe. These are from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll. These are from the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford. From HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh Mary Wakefield, the Spectator journalist who is married to Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s special adviser, has denied being the second woman at the lunch attended by Charlotte Edwardes 20 years ago where the latter alleges she was groped by Johnson. There was a rumour Wakefield was the second woman referred to, but not named, in Edwardes\u2019 Sunday Times column as being groped by the then editor. There are two urgent questions in the Commons today, starting at 2.30pm. (There are no questions today.) My colleague Graeme Wearden will be covering them on his business live blog, but I will flag up the highlights from Graeme\u2019s blog here too. In the conference hall yesterday Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, seemed to get a warmer reception than any of his ministerial colleagues. He has been speaking at a Daily Telegraph fringe event at lunchtime and, as the Telegraph\u2019s Owen Bennett points out, the queue to see him was huge. And here are some of the best lines, from the Telegraph\u2019s Kate Ferguson, my colleague Rowena Mason, the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom, and PoliticsHome\u2019s Alain Tolhurst. Rees-Mogg defended Boris Johnson\u2019s use of the term \u201csurrender bill\u201d. He stressed that the EU agreeing to a Brexit extension was not inevitable. He defended Johnson\u2019s decision to dismiss Labour MP Paula Sherriff\u2019s question about threats to MPs in the Commons last week as \u201chumbug\u201d. Rees-Mogg said the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was \u201cone of the most stupid\u201d pieces of legislation passed by parliament. He did not deny calling the supreme court ruling a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. He praised David Gauke, one of the 21 pro-European Tories who had the whip removed after rebelling over Brexit, and said he was sorry Gauke had the whip removed. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll is at a Bruges Group fringe. The Bruges Group represents hardline Brexiters, and it seems that the Guardian is not especially popular ... Dominic Grieve, one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed after rebelling over Brexit and one of the MPs involved in drafting the Benn Act to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, has said he thinks the legislation is robust, and that ministers will not find loopholes in it. In an interview with Sky News, Grieve said that if Boris Johnson tried to ignore the law, the courts could force him to comply. [Johnson] would be taken to court and a writ of mandamus would be issued against him and he would be told, as a matter of law, that he has to write the letter [to the EU requesting a Brexit delay]. The case could go to the supreme court and I suspect the courts could deal with it very quickly. Grieve also said that, if Johnson tried to ignore the courts, ultimately he could be dismissed as prime minister by the Queen. In another interview, asked if he had squeezed the thigh of the journalist Charlotte Edwardes 20 years ago, Boris Johnson replied: No, and I think what the public want to hear is about what we are doing to level up and unite the country. Asked if that meant she had made it up, he replied: I\u2019m just saying what I\u2019ve said. What the public want to hear is what we are doing for them and for the country and the investment in ways of uniting the country. Asked if stories about his personal life were overshadowing the conference, he replied: Not at all. I think what the public want to hear is what we are doing to bring the country together and get on with improving their lives. I think I would make one general comment: I think there is a lot of people who basically want to stop us delivering Brexit on October 31. But I have to tell you we are not going to be deterred from that ambition. We are going to get on and do it, we are going to get us over the line. I think that that is the best thing for the country because it\u2019s been going on a long time now, this row over Brexit. The pharmaceutical industry has already moved 25% of its medicine imports away from Calais to mitigate the risk of bottlenecks in a no-deal scenario, the industry body has revealed. Mike Thompson, the chief executive of the British Pharmaceutical Association, has also criticised the EU for not allowing the industry on both sides of the channel to engage in talks to prevent blockages. \u201cThere has been an enormous focus on what\u2019s going on. Politics is getting in the way,\u201d he told a fringe event at the Tory conference called \u201cThe NHS in a post-Brexit world\u201d. He said the refusal of the EU to engage with the issue of potential medicine shortages in a no-deal Brexit will gone down in history as a mistake. The UK exports 46m finished packs of medicines to the EU compared with 37m imported by the UK. Among the drugs supplied to the continent was a specialist prostate cancer drug manufactured in Macclesfield, he said. Thompson told the conference that the UK buys 12,300 types of drugs a year and there are generally shortages in 52-100 of them. BBC News has just broadcast a clip of Boris Johnson responding to a question about whether he squeezed Charlotte Edwardes\u2019 thigh at a Spectator lunch 20 years ago with a long and rambling reply about his plans to improve bus services. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Joe Pike, Boris Johnson refused to apologise for his comment about money spent on historical child abuse investigations being \u201cspaffed up a wall\u201d. Johnson said it was \u201cvery, very important\u201d that historical child abuse was investigated, in places such as Rotherham. But he said his comment referred to other cases where allegations were unfounded, such as those raised by the man known as \u201cNick\u201d. Good spot from ITV\u2019s Angus Walker: But it wasn\u2019t all Labour-bashing. In his speech, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, also set an ambitious target for education policy over the next decade. He said he wanted England to be better than Germany at technical education within a decade. (Education policy is devolved, so he is just education secretary for England.) I promise to give my all to make technical and vocational education the first choice for anybody \u2026 with the aptitude, desire and interest to pursue it. Apprenticeships, technical and vocational education are just as valuable as university education, and they are just as important to our economy. So, today, I am setting a new ambition: to super-charge further education over the next decade with an aim to overtake Germany in the opportunities we offer to those studying technical routes by 2029. Williamson said he would set up an expert skills and productivity board to help achieve this. He also said the government would be spending an extra \u00a3120m to set up institutes of technology in 20 cities. To anyone familiar with debates about education policy, this will be familiar; politicians have been saying things like this for years. In fact, the first speech I ever covered by a politician, when I was a trainee reporter on the South Wales Echo in 1990, involved Peter Walker, the then Welsh secretary, speaking about how Britain needed to copy Germany\u2019s expertise in vocational and technical educational. Walker\u2019s speech (which was much better than Williamson\u2019s) made the point that Germany had been a pioneer in this field since the late 19th century. Good luck to Williamson if he wants the UK to catch up within the next decade, but it might not be straightforward. UPDATE: This is from Sam Freedman, a policy adviser at the Department for Education when Michael Gove was education secretary. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, used his conference speech, to claim that Labour\u2019s plans to return schools to local authority control would amount to removing \u201cchoice\u201d from parents. He said: I\u2019m not going to let Labour\u2019s ideological zealots tear up years of progress \u2026 made by both New Labour and Conservative governments. Because let\u2019s be clear: abolishing all primary school tests, ending phonics reading tests, scrapping free schools and academies, taking freedom from headteachers, and choice from parents, returning all schools to local authority control, scrapping Ofsted, and making local authorities responsible for inspecting their own schools and even their own local children\u2019s services, this is no plan for the future. This is a recipe for disaster. From the Spectator\u2019s Isabel Hardman: These are from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, who interviewed Sajid Javid, the chancellor, this morning. In his speech to the conference earlier Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he loved the NHS because it embodied \u201ctimeless Conservative values\u201d. He said: Now, as you might have heard, I love the NHS. And I think the NHS embodies timeless Conservative values: Patriotism \u2013 because we look out for each other in this country. Global leadership \u2013 because in many ways it\u2019s the finest health service in the world. Public service \u2013 because so many people give so much, day in day out, to care for others. These values are Conservative values, they are British values, and they are the values of the NHS. Sir Nicholas Soames, one of the 21 Tories who had the whip withdrawn after a Brexit rebellion earlier this month, has described the decision to punish those 21 as \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d. On the conference stage Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was asked to name the one thing the Conservatives should be saying on the doorstep about the Tory approach to public services. He replied: With the NHS, the single most important thing, which is so important, is that we show and communicate that we love the NHS. Normally at Tory conferences cabinet ministers have a sprinkling of policy announcements in their speeches. This year most of them have had little or nothing to say on policy. Partly that\u2019s because the overall focus is on \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d, but partly it is because this is a government without a majority, probably just weeks away from an election, which is not really in a position to implement anything. Instead, ministers are using their speeches to rehearse attack lines against Labour. Therese Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, used her speech a moment ago to claim that a Jeremy Corbyn government would penalise pensioners. She was not arguing about the value of state benefits, but instead making an argument about the value of pension funds, and the possible impact on them of policies like Labour\u2019s inclusive ownership funds. (See 10.33am.) She said: Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour will hit pensioners\u2019 saving pots through hiking taxes and renationalising swaths of industry \u2013 costing pensioners thousands of pounds. Unlike Conservatives. Since 2010, we have increased the basic state pension by \u00a31,600 a year. Boris Johnson\u2019s long-standing allies have accused him of shutting them out and only listening to his adviser, the Vote Leave campaign head Dominic Cummings, and to Carrie Symonds, Johnson\u2019s partner, the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn is reporting this morning. Newton Dunn says Lynton Crosby, the Tory election strategist, and Will Walden, Johnson\u2019s communications chief when he was London mayor, feel marginalised. Newton Dunn writes: One former close ally of the PM\u2019s told the Sun: \u201cThe Cummings experiment has palpably failed, but Boris will not turn the ship. \u201cHe\u2019s only listening to two voices now, Dominic and Carrie - and Dominic\u2019s approach is proving a car crash. We\u2019re getting really worried.\u201d Having played a key part in Boris\u2019s leadership campaign, it has also emerged that Mr Walden refused to take up a senior role in No 10 after feeling marginalised, and has returned to his job in PR. In the conference hall Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has just delivered what he said was his first speech to a Tory conference. He spent much of it attacking Labour, saying that its plan to give up to 10% of shares in large companies to an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d controlled by workers would be \u201cthe largest expropriation of assets ever seen in a western democracy\u201d. Sunak said: Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would fundamentally destroy the free enterprise economy that pays for our nurses, our teachers, our armed forces. Take just one example. Their plan to confiscate 10% of the value of all successful companies. What would happen? Investment would cease, jobs would disappear, pensions savings would be hammered. This \u00a3300bn raid would be the largest expropriation of assets ever seen in a western democracy. I\u2019ve spent my career in business, investing in companies, big and small. I have pored over Labour\u2019s plans in detail and I can tell you, everybody would end up paying the price. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has criticised Sajid Javid for not being able to say how much a no-deal Brexit would cost the economy. (See 8.21am.) McDonnell said: The chancellor refused to say what the real costs of a no-deal Brexit would be, or how it would impact on the economy. He either has no clue or he is being completely disingenuous, because he knows what a disaster no deal would be for everyone except the super rich. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, will use his conference speech to announce plans to extend the right that housing association tenants have to shared ownership of their homes. In a press statement, the Conservative party says: We will establish a new national model for shared ownership which allows people in new housing association properties to buy a proportion of their home while paying a subsidised rent on the rest \u2013 helping thousands of lower earners step on to the housing ladder. People will be able to buy more of their home in 1% increments, rather than the 10% (or more) chunks currently required. This seems to be mostly a restatement of a plan announced by the housing ministry over the summer. Sajid Javid implied in his Today interview that the government does have a plan to bypass the Benn Act. In a useful Twitter thread at the weekend, the Times\u2019s Raphael Hogarth listed five possible ways in which this could be done - all of which he thinks are flawed. Here are the main points from Sajid Javid\u2019s Today interview. The chancellor signalled he has a plan to cut taxes or boost spending to protect the economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He said: I\u2019m also clear that, if it was no deal, there would be a significant economic policy response. You have the independent Bank of England that will almost certainly think about a monetary policy response, and that\u2019s for them. But I will be thinking about a fiscal, and other economic policy, response. Javid said he would be saying more about this in his conference speech this afternoon. His comment about the Bank of England implies that it would cut interest rates in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This is a fair assumption. Mark Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, told MPs recently that he was more likely than not to cut rates in the event of no deal, but he has also said that this is not a certainty. He argues that a no-deal Brexit would be an unusual economic shock because as well as restricting demand (which supports the case for a rate cut), it may restrict supply too (which could strengthen the case for a rate rise). Chris Giles, the FT\u2019s economics editor, thinks the bank will not be happy with what Javid said. Javid implied the government has a plan to bypass the Benn Act, which is designed to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Today\u2019s Nick Robinson said he did not expect Javid to tell him how the government might get round this, because the prime minister himself has refused to answer this question. But Robinson asked if Javid knew what the government\u2019s plan was to sidestep the act. Javid replied: I think I do. Javid said he did not want to give details, but he said the government would obey the law. Asked if he was really telling the financial markets the UK would definitely be leaving on 31 October in all circumstances, Javid replied: Yes, we\u2019ve been very clear, and we could not be clearer. What investors, businesses and others want to know is that you are going to end this uncertainty. We\u2019ve had delay after delay after delay. Businesses want to see an end to the uncertainty. And the way we do that is leave. Javid dismissed EU complaints that the UK has failed to table firm plans to replace the backstop as a negotiating tactic. When asked about their demands for a plan from the UK, he replied: Whether it\u2019s Michel Barnier or others involved in the EU side, they will say all sorts of things. It is part of a negotiating strategy. Javid said politicians had not taken bus services seriously enough. He said: For most of the country, especially when you get out of our capital city, the main public transport people rely on is buses. And I think politicians just haven\u2019t taken [them] seriously enough. Javid\u2019s father was a bus driver. Javid said Boris Johnson had assured him personally that the groping allegation against him was not true. He said: If you are referring to these allegations of a personal nature that were made a couple of days ago, I\u2019ve talked to the prime minister about that. First of all, he could not be clearer \u2013 absolutely clear that they are completely untrue. And I totally trust him on that. Javid referred to allegations \u201cmade a couple of days ago\u201d, but he appeared to be talking about the groping story, which was in yesterday\u2019s Sunday Times. Johnson is also facing allegations about his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri, but in this case he is not denying allegations \u2013 just saying he did nothing wrong, and refusing to comment on his personal life. Javid said he thought the Conservatives would launch an inquiry into Islamophobia in the party in due course. Q: What has happened to the Tory inquiry into Islamophobia in the party? Javid says it will happen. Q: At a fringe meeting last night some people questioned whether Islamophobia even exists. Javid says he does not know about that. He says he prefers to call this anti-Islam hate crime. When people talk about Islamophobia, they think it is about stopping people attacking a religion. He can see why people should be allowed to attack a religion. It is attacking people he finds objectionable, he says. Q: Should the PM set a lead? Should his behaviour be better than other people\u2019s? Javid says the PM is taking a lead. People want to get Brexit done. Johnson is taking a lead on that. Q: Yesterday a No 10 spokesman accused Tory MPs of foreign collusion. Is the government really behaving properly? Javid says the government should behave properly at all times. We have seen inappropriate language across parliament. [The shadow chancellor] John McDonnell has talked about MPs being lynched. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary soon. Javid says he has spoken to Johnson about the groping allegation. Johnson denies it. Javid says he trusts him. He says he does not get involved when people make allegations like this. Q: Your plan for buses involves spending just \u00a330m. That will make just a dent on the spending lost over the last decade. Javid says the total spending being announced is worth \u00a3220m. He says, outside London, buses are the main public transport people rely on. Politicians have not paid enough attention to them. He wants contactless payment and joined-up services. Q: When Jeremy Corbyn raised it at PMQs, Tory MPs laughed. Does he deserve an apology? Javid says he cannot remember the context. Perhaps people made a point about Corbyn avoiding the topic of Brexit. Q: What would the cost to the UK be of leaving the UK without a deal? Javid says it is hard to know. Q: The OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] reckons it would cost \u00a330bn a year. Javid says the Treasury is making plans for how to manage this. He says he hopes the government would be able to deal with many of those disruptuions. He says, if there was no deal, that would be a \u201csignificant economic policy response\u201d. He will say more in his speech, he says. He would respond in fiscal and other terms. Javid signals he has plan to cut taxes or increase spending in event of no-deal Brexit. Q: Are the EU going to get formal proposals from the UK this week? Javid says the EU complaints are just part of a negotiating strategy. He says a few weeks ago the EU were saying they would not change the withdrawal agreement. Now they are open to that. Q: Most ministers think the chance of a deal is less than 20%. Do you agree? Javid says he won\u2019t put a figure on it. Nick Robinson is interviewing Sajid Javid. Robinson talks about the long-term consequences of a no-deal Brexit. And he plays this clip of Boris Johnson speaking last night. Q: Ministers say we are leaving on 31 October. But there is a law saying that cannot happen if there is no deal. Can the UK leave without a deal on 31 october. Yes, says Javid. He says the government would prefer a deal. Q: Do you know how the government will get around this law? I don\u2019t expect you to tell me how. Javid replies: I think I do. He says he does not want to discuss the detail. But he says the government will obey the law. Javid suggests government has plan to bypass Benn Act outlawing no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Q: I know you won\u2019t tell me how you will get round this law. But is this talk just bravado, or are you telling the markets we will definitely be out on 31 October. Javid says the UK will leave. It wants a deal, but is prepared to leave without one. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is addressing the Conservative conference in Manchester this afternoon and, as is usual, the party has previewed his speech with an overnight policy announcement. It is about infrastructure spending. But it has failed to grip the news agenda. Partly that\u2019s because the government is now far short of having a majority, so anything big announced at this conference is basically an election pledge, not a statement of intent by a party in power. And partly it\u2019s because large elements of what was in the overnight press notice have been announced before. And mostly, of course, it is because before Javid can even mention the word infrastructure in the interviews he is doing this morning, he is finding himself fending off questions about Boris Johnson\u2019s behaviour towards women. This is what Javid told BBC News about the allegation that Johnson groped a journalist at a Spectator lunch when he was editing the magazine. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get drawn into personal allegations. For my part, I\u2019m not going to get into that. The prime minister has said that this is completely untrue. I have full faith in the prime minister, I don\u2019t doubt what he has said for a second but I\u2019m not going to get drawn into these allegations. But Justine Greening, the former Tory cabinet minister, who now sits as an independent having lost the whip as one of the 21 Brexit rebels, gave a very different assessment on the Today programme. She said: I can\u2019t comment on those accusations, but they are deeply concerning and in a sense they go to the heart of this question about character and integrity of people in public life and what standards the electorate have a right to expect. Javid will be on Today at 8.10am. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, Therese Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, speak in a session at the Tory conference on public services. 10.45am: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, speaks. 11.20am: Jake Berry, the northern powerhouse minister, Esther McVey, the housing minister, and Nadim Zahawi, a business minister, speak at a session on \u201clevelling up\u201d. 2pm: Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business minister, and Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister, speak in a session on the economy. 2.30pm: The Commons sits. MPs will hold debates on the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act. 2.55pm: Sajid Javid, the chancellor, speaks. 3.15pm: Nicky Morgan, the culture minister, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, and Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, speak in a session on infrastructure. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively on the Conservative conference. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks for your emails and tweets. Stick around for all the reports and reaction but from me, cheerio! Here\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang: \u201cWe take a point. We were 1-0 down, we came back, the team fought very well. It\u2019s always hard to come here. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy when you concede just before half-time but we had great spirit in the second half. \u201cI was sure that I was not offside so I just try to finish as usual.\u201d Here\u2019s Daniel Taylor\u2019s match report from Old Trafford: So Arsenal move up to fourth while Manchester United are 10th, already 12 points behind Liverpool at the top. Peep! Peeeep!! PEEEEEEEEP!!! So it finishes 1-1. The second half was better than the first but you\u2019d have to say the game as a whole was exactly what it was: a battle between two teams who will finish between fifth and eighth. 90+5 min: \u2026 Ceballos\u2019s delivery is poor and that is that. 90+4 min: Nelson wins a free-kick on the right edge of the United area \u2026 90+3 min: Willock and Nelson combine neatly and the latter scuffs what was presentable chance on the edge of the box. 90+1 min: \u2026 WHAT A SAVE! A fine full-length stop from Leno denies Rashford. 90 min: Brilliant surge from McTominay, who has been very good this evening. David Luiz upends him right on the edge of the box as we tick into added time \u2026 89 min: United are finishing on the front foot here. McTominay\u2019s shot is blocked on the edge of the box. 87 min: Horrible mistake by Young in midfield which allows Willock to break. He pulls back to Ceballos, whose shot is wide and wild. 85 min: \u2026 which in turn forces a scramble at the near post and another corner. Which is cleared. 84 min: Arsenal force a corner \u2026 82 min: Pogba slings in a viciously curling cross from deep which Leno grabs just ahead of Rashford. 80 min: Another Arsenal sub: Willock replaces Saka. 79 min: \u2026 hoiked to the back post, scrambled clear by Arsenal, walloped into the stands by Fred. 78 min: James wriggles through and wins another corner \u2026 76 min: Greenwood gets clonked by Xhaka, who gets a booking for his trouble. 74 min: \u2026 which comes to nothing. Ch-ch-ch-changes: Lingard and Pereira for Fred and Greenwood. And Nelson for the ineffective Pepe. 73 min: Maguire lashes a shot from distance and Leno tips over acrobatically. United corner \u2026 72 min: Maguire does well to scoop a dinked free-kick back into the danger area but it drops to an Arsenal defender. This is now A Good Game. 71 min: Rashford shoots across goal \u2026 it should be a corner but a goal kick is given. Though that corner McTominay should\u2019ve scored from should have been a goal kick. So, you know. Swings and roundabouts. 69 min: \u2026 which Young swings in and should be buried by McTominay, five yards out. Somehow he heads over. 68 min: James, who has been a real bright spot for United, wins a corner \u2026 66 min: Guendouzi does really well on the edge of the Arsenal box, fighting several fires and eventually winning a free-kick off Lingard, who goes into the book. 64 min: Just wide from Pogba! James\u2019s shot is blocked on the edge of the box, but the ball breaks loose for Pogba who curls his effort just the wrong side of the post. 62 min: That\u2019s a victory for VAR I guess. It was a terrible decision from the assistant referee, though there is a slight suggestion that United\u2019s defenders had stopped at the sight of the flag. Not that they were in a position to do anything about Aubameyang\u2019s shot. So, all in all, the right outcome. 60 min: And Arsenal should be ahead. Saka misses a glorious opportunity from 10 yards out, his shot deflected wide. And it\u2019s given. Aubameyang is yards onside. Tuanzebe gives the ball away horribly to Saka, who pops it straight through to Aubameyang. He lifts the ball over De Gea and Arsenal are level. 59 min: Arsenal have the ball in the net but the flag goes up. Off to VAR we go! 58 min: \u201cWell, I was thinking about ambling around to the pub for the second half,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cAfter reading about the first half, I haven\u2019t bothered. Which, of course, means that the last half hour or so will probably turn into the greatest match in history. If it does, you can all thank me!\u201d 57 min: Guendouzi makes a vital interception with Rashford closing in. Much livelier so far, this second half. 55 min: Hmm. Well the ball certainly hit Kolasinac on the arm but hey ho. Ceballos replaces Torreira for Arsenal, a bit of artistry replacing the Uruguayan\u2019s grit. 54 min: Arsenal are asleep at a short corner \u2026 the ball bobbles up and hits Kolasinac \u2026 on the arm? VAR says: \u201cNothing to see here.\u201d 52 min: Better from Arsenal now, though it\u2019s not easy to see exactly what the plan is. Their best moments have come when Aubameyang has pulled wide \u2013 such as this one, when he pops a cross in to Torreira, who really should do better with a volley from close range. 51 min: \u2026 worked short and eventually lofted in by Aubameyang but De Gea claims comfortably. 50 min: The Gunners force a corner in front of the travelling fans \u2026 48 min: United dominate the ball at the start of the second period. Arsenal look a little flat. 46 min: \u201cThe fact is that for the goal Xhaka quite literally ducks his captain responsibilities,\u201d honks Graham Fulcher. To be fair, I think he\u2019s trying to head it. He makes an unholy mess of it but that\u2019s neither here not there. Peep! Off we go again then. This has to be better than the first half. Surely. Half-time email dept. \u201cThe goal seems to have come from a different match,\u201d writes Charles Antaki. \u201cThe quality otherwise was that of a sitcom three years past its peak and reduced to physical humour of the least amusing kind, pratfalls included, performed by actors who don\u2019t much like each other or the script. New stage directions please. \u201cBefore the game I thought this one would be terribly interesting,\u201d writes JR in Illinois. \u201cThe goal notwithstanding (which I didn\u2019t think was all that good anyway) so far it\u2019s not at all interesting but it sure is terrible. This game stinks to high heaven.\u201d PEEEEP! A drab half ends with United taking the lead in unexpected fashion. Generally it\u2019s been scrappy and low quality but things picked up just before the break. Let\u2019s hope that carries on in the second period. 45+1 min: Well, I don\u2019t think anyone saw that coming. James did brilliantly on the break, his cross just evading Rashford. The England striker, though, kept the ball alive and pulled it back to the edge of the box where McTominay took a touch and fired home, via a slight touch of Sokratis. Crikey! What a strike this is! The Scotland midfielder lashes one in to the top corner from the edge of the box. 44 min: Fine double save from De Gea keeps it at 0-0. Pereira slips as Arsenal break \u2013 Saka\u2019s first shot is parried superbly and Guendouzi\u2019s follow-up is blocked at the near post. 42 min: Pogba shrugs Guendouzi off the ball and sends Rashford through. The forward, though, looks a little tentative and defenders get back to smother the danger. 41 min: Young clatters Guendouzi (who has been in the wars this half) and goes into the book. Four yellows so far. 40 min: Pogba is loose with his control. Again. But he\u2019s hardly been alone this half. 38 min: It\u2019s always nice to be surrounded by friends. But here we\u2019ve got a Friend being surrounded. Pepe and McTominay clash in midfield and the referee gives the free-kick Arsenal\u2019s way \u2013 cue protestations \u2013 before changing his mind (correctly). 36 min: Arsenal get a shot on target away. Aubameyang finds Pepe at the back post but De Gea gathers his weak shot. 35 min: Pogba, looking a little rusty, gives the ball away and Arsenal quickly hand it back. 34 min: From the free-kick, Xhaka dinks the ball over the defensive line but it\u2019s pretty aimless and unthreatening. A breakdown in communication perhaps. 32 min: Pereira sends Guendouzi flying and goes into the book as Arsenal get on the front foot. 30 min: And another. It\u2019s P\u00e9p\u00e9 this time. It\u2019s hopeless but it still counts. He\u2019s in a decent amount of space on the corner of the United box but wangs his effort way over the bar. 29 min: What\u2019s this? A SHOT! Pereira skitters forward, angling his run in from the right and getting defenders backpeddling. David Luiz is beaten with aplomb but his shot from the edge of the box is smartly stopped by Leno. 27 min: Rashford joins Chambers in the book after sliding in slightly wildly on Sokratis. 25 min: The good news is that the rain seems to have eased a touch. I\u2019m not sure we can blame the weather for the lack of goalmouth action but we\u2019ve got to lay the responsibility somewhere \u2026 24 min: Pepe completely wastes a free-kick on the left, looping the ball miserably out of play. 23 min: Halfway through the first half and neither keeper has had to make a save. In fact, no one has had a shot yet. Not a one. 22 min: Leno gathers James\u2019s low cross after a nice but of work from McTominay in midfield. 20 min: Players from both sides surround Kevin Friend: Arsenal players want Lingard booked for pulling back Saka; United\u2019s are eager to point out that their should\u2019ve been a handball against Guendouzi just prior to Saka\u2019s break. Neither set of players seem particularly satisfied by Friend\u2019s response. 18 min: Tuanzebe calmly and confidently deals with a dangerous through-ball under pressure. He\u2019s started well. 16 min: James again runs at Chambers but this time his touch is too loose and the Arsenal man can deal with the situation. Pretty clear what United\u2019s plan is at the moment \u2013 get the ball to Daniel James and ask him to run at the Arsenal defence. 14 min: Kolasinac charges forward into space and looks to curl a pass into the danger area. He does \u2026 but his teammates aren\u2019t on the same wavelength and De Gea can collect with little bother. 12 min: McTominay and Pogba are getting the better of Arsenal\u2019s midfield trio thus far. 10 min: Chambers goes into Kevin Friend\u2019s Big Book Of Very Naughty Boys for a pulling back Daniel James. It\u2019s 2-0 to the United winger so far. 9 min: \u2026 slung deep to Maguire, who wins the header but Rashford can\u2019t bring the loose ball under his spell. 8 min: James gets a chance to run at Chambers and gets the better of his man. David Luiz blocks the low cross \u2013 corner to United \u2026 6 min: It\u2019s been a bit of a scrappy start, with United enjoying most of the ball but things all a little untidy. 5 min: \u2026 which comes to nothing. 4 min: Xhaka takes a quick free-kick looking long for Chambers flying forward. Tuanzebe nods behind for an Arsenal corner \u2026 2 min: The rain continues to hammer down at Old Trafford. Guendouzi gives away the first free-kick of the evening with a trip on McTominay. 1 min: Interestingly Tuanzebe has started at left-back for United, with Ashley Young switching to the right. Peep! Off we go then. Arsenal, in yellow, get us under way. The players are in the tunnel \u2026 handshakes, hugs and smiles seem to be the order of the day rather than angry words and jabbing fingers. Ashley Young and Arsenal\u2019s newly-confimed full-time captain Granit Xhaka lead the teams out. A bit of pre-match Ole: \u201cIt\u2019s two good attacking teams. We have to stamp our authority on the game. Getting the first goal is always important in these games.\u201d Roy Keane is on Sky Sports\u2019 Monday Night Football for the first time. He\u2019s been reminiscing about his rivalry with Patrick Vieira and some of those classic Arsenal-Manchester United meetings \u2013 and he\u2019s been great in all honesty. He\u2019s much better on these topics than he is in Old-Man-Shouts-At-Cloud mode. I should point out as I made an error in the team lineups earlier: Maitland-Niles is not suspended; he\u2019s on the bench having served his one-match ban in midweek. A bit of pre-match stattage: Bukayo Saka, at 18 years and 25 days old, is the youngest player ever to start in this fixture in the (apologies) \u201cPremier League era\u201d. Axel Tuanzebe, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t started a game for Manchester United since May 2017. A bit of pre-match Unai. He\u2019s asked about the absence of Mesut Ozil. \u201cNot today!\u201d he says of the Germany midfielder, which is as goos an answer as any I suppose. Weather watch: it\u2019s hammering it down at Old Trafford. Manchester United (4-2-3-1): De Gea; Tuanzebe, Lindelof, Maguire, Young; McTominay, Pogba; Andreas Pereira, Lingard, James; Rashford. Subs: Romero, Rojo, Williams, Fred, Mata, Matic, Greenwood. Arsenal (4-3-3): Leno; Chambers, Sokratis, David Luiz, Kolasinac; Guendouzi, Xhaka, Torreira; Pepe, Aubameyang, Saka. Subs: Martinez, Maitland-Niles, Holding, Ceballos, Willock, Nelson, Martinelli Referee: Kevin Friend So two changes for Arsenal \u2013 Chambers and Torreira for Maitland-Niles and Ceballos (who are both on the bench). As expected, Rashford and Pogba are both passed fit for United, which means Mason Greenwood drops to the bench. No Wan-Bissaka for United, so Axel Tuanzebe is in at right-back. A bit of pre-match reading: Here\u2019s Jonathan Wilson on the malaise at Manchester United: \u201cIt may be that a squad this piecemeal, patched together from the remnants of four very different managers\u2019 inclinations under a board that has demonstrated little in the way of football expertise, makes the act of management almost impossible \u2026\u201d And here\u2019s Nick Ames on tonight\u2019s game: \u201cAnyone still tuning in for the spit and snarl of the 1990s and 2000s \u2013 the bust-ups involving Schmeichel, Wright, Keane, Vieira, Keown, Van Nistelrooy, F\u00e0bregas, a pizza buffet, Wenger and Ferguson \u2013 will be short-changed.\u201d Hello all. And welcome to what could be a wet and wild night in Manchester and this clash between perhaps the two most interesting teams in the Premier League right now. Of course, being interesting isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. There are strains of fungal infection that are presumably extremely interesting (to some) but that doesn\u2019t mean you want to get intimately involved with them. Or follow their progress through thick and thin over nine months. Manchester United have won one in five Premier League games since the opening day of the season. Indeed since that stunning win over PSG in Paris back in March, their league record reads: P15 W4 D4 L7 Pts16 which is in many ways, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree, a far more interesting record than when they were winning all those titles in the 90s. Perhaps only Marco Silva at Everton looks on thinner ice than Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, who is hamstrung by injuries this evening. Unai Emery\u2019s Arsenal, meanwhile, are something of a footballing fruit machine at the moment, at times paying out gloriously, at times so frustrating you just want to pour your pint over them and find something else to do. Kick-off is 8pm BST.",

      "body": "<p>No team at this World Cup lacks for motivation but, amid the skyscrapers of Japan\u2019s sprawling capital city, England\u2019s desire for redemption is more intense than most. Four years ago they were ejected from their own tournament in the pool stages and a fierce collective determination to put the record straight is increasingly apparent.</p> <p>Then, as now, England\u2019s campaign hinged on two tough pool games scheduled on consecutive weekends. The memory of those twin 2015 Twickenham defeats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/26/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">against Wales</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/03/england-australia-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Australia</a> still grates with all involved and, in the lead\u2011up to his side\u2019s concluding pool fixtures against Argentina and France, the No 8 Billy Vunipola is eager to exorcise a few ghosts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/29/kyle-sinckler-england-argentina-rugby-world-cup\">Kyle Sinckler backs England\u2019s forward \u2018tank\u2019 to handle Argentina\u2019s power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under normal circumstances Vunipola would be looking ahead rather then in the rear-view mirror but the urge to atone for 2015 is, he says, a common goal across the entire squad. \u201cIn 2015 we went in with massive expectations on our backs and we didn\u2019t deliver,\u201d said Vunipola, finally fit again after an injury-disrupted couple of seasons.</p> <p>\u201cThat is still pretty vivid in my mind. It\u2019s not something I enjoyed, not something I want to do again. We now know what that feeling is like. You have been hurt before and you don\u2019t want to be like that again. That\u2019s driving us as much as anything else. It is a massive opportunity to right a few wrongs.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the healing process has involved Eddie Jones bringing in psychologists to try to reduce any lingering mental baggage from previous English World Cup failures. \u201cHe has definitely got the baggage out,\u201d said Vunipola, revealing the squad had accepted they needed to be a much tighter unit. \u201cProbably the biggest thing we needed to improve was how together we can be.</p> <p>\u201cEvery other team says they are doing it, but being brutally honest can hurt a few feelings. Being within the confines of England rugby, a lot of us are very precious. When you\u2019re at your club you\u2019re the main man but when you\u2019re with England you\u2019re just the next person. There were a few handbags thrown around but it was really good. It\u2019s really hard but it is a thing: men don\u2019t know how to talk about their feelings. It took us a while but we got there in the end.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re on a different level to any England side I\u2019ve previously been involved with.

      "bodyText": "No team at this World Cup lacks for motivation but, amid the skyscrapers of Japan\u2019s sprawling capital city, England\u2019s desire for redemption is more intense than most. Four years ago they were ejected from their own tournament in the pool stages and a fierce collective determination to put the record straight is increasingly apparent. Then, as now, England\u2019s campaign hinged on two tough pool games scheduled on consecutive weekends. The memory of those twin 2015 Twickenham defeats against Wales and Australia still grates with all involved and, in the lead\u2011up to his side\u2019s concluding pool fixtures against Argentina and France, the No 8 Billy Vunipola is eager to exorcise a few ghosts. Under normal circumstances Vunipola would be looking ahead rather then in the rear-view mirror but the urge to atone for 2015 is, he says, a common goal across the entire squad. \u201cIn 2015 we went in with massive expectations on our backs and we didn\u2019t deliver,\u201d said Vunipola, finally fit again after an injury-disrupted couple of seasons. \u201cThat is still pretty vivid in my mind. It\u2019s not something I enjoyed, not something I want to do again. We now know what that feeling is like. You have been hurt before and you don\u2019t want to be like that again. That\u2019s driving us as much as anything else. It is a massive opportunity to right a few wrongs.\u201d Part of the healing process has involved Eddie Jones bringing in psychologists to try to reduce any lingering mental baggage from previous English World Cup failures. \u201cHe has definitely got the baggage out,\u201d said Vunipola, revealing the squad had accepted they needed to be a much tighter unit. \u201cProbably the biggest thing we needed to improve was how together we can be. \u201cEvery other team says they are doing it, but being brutally honest can hurt a few feelings. Being within the confines of England rugby, a lot of us are very precious. When you\u2019re at your club you\u2019re the main man but when you\u2019re with England you\u2019re just the next person. There were a few handbags thrown around but it was really good. It\u2019s really hard but it is a thing: men don\u2019t know how to talk about their feelings. It took us a while but we got there in the end. \u201cWe\u2019re on a different level to any England side I\u2019ve previously been involved with. This is the first team that is willing to go deeper than just say: \u2018I think you should have hit this ruck.\u2019 We\u2019ve talked about things we\u2019ve never previously been able to put out there as a group and it\u2019s brought us closer together. There is a lot more respect in that changing room for each other and it\u2019s been really fun. It\u2019s partly about just listening to each other, caring about another person\u2019s opinion and taking it on board, rather than going back to your room and having a little moan to your mate.\u201d There does indeed seem to be a closer social bond among the 2019 players than has been the case at some World Cup tournaments but, as Vunipola acknowledges, that will be incidental should they be turned over by the Pumas or Les Bleus in their forthcoming two pool games. \u201cOur destiny is in our own hands still and we have to put down a marker, not for anyone else but for ourselves as a team,\u201d Vunipola said. \u201cWe have talked a lot about it but talking is different to doing. \u201cFor me, personally, what drives me a lot is people doubting my personal abilities and also the team. What people say about us can either affect you and make you crumble, or help you prove everyone wrong.

Welcome to another packed night of athletics in front of decidedly non-packed stands.</strong></p> <p>We\u2019ll start with the men\u2019s 110m hurdles heats, then the men of the 200 metres will take centre stage for the semi-finals. Adam Gemili soared through the heats in 20.06 seconds, with the fastest time of the round and also of his season. However, all eyes will be on Noah Lyles of the United States and his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/olympicchannel/status/1178384942826434562\">dodgy dye job</a> as he looks to consolidate his frightening world leading 19.50 this year by reaching the final. Other challengers include Lyles\u2019 countryman Michael Norman, defending champion Ramil Guliyev of Turkey, Ecuador\u2019s Alex Quinonez and 100m champion Christian Coleman. Alongside Gemili, Britain have two formidable entrants in Miguel Francis and Zharnel Hughes.</p> <p>The finals will come fast. In the women\u2019s high jump final, neutral athlete Mariya Lasitskene is, as usual, the pick of the field as she bids to become the first three-time high jump world champion. Sweden\u2019s Daniel Stahl threw two metres further than anyone else going into the men\u2019s discus final. Meanwhile, the men\u2019s 5000 metres is wide open in the absence of Mo Farah, Kenya\u2019s Beatrice Chepkoech will be vying for the 3000 metres steeplechase title, and in the 800 metres final, Ajee Wilson of the United States will be the woman to beat. <br></p> <p>The night will conclude with the men\u2019s 400 metres hurdles taking centre stage and, for once, it will garner all the attention as Karsten Warholm, Rai Benjamin and Abderrahman Samba, three of the four men in history to dip under 47 seconds, will resume their rivalry as they fight for gold and, just maybe, a new world record.<br></p> <p>Here\u2019s Sean Ingle with more on a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d of a world championships so far...<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/30/doha-world-athletics-championships-crowds-iaaf\">Dire in Doha: world championships \u2018catastrophe\u2019 leaves athletics reeling | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-30T17:08:21.053Z\">at 6.08pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Finally, here is Sean Ingle\u2019s report from Doha. That\u2019s all from me today but we\u2019ll do it all over again tomorrow when we will have finals in the men\u2019s pole vault, women\u2019s javelin, men\u2019s 800 metres and men\u2019s 200 metres, plus semi-finals of the women\u2019s 400 metres and 200 metres including the one and only Dina Asher-Smith. Until tomorrow. In addition to being relieved that he is still alive, Karsten Warholm was also already thinking of the work that is still to be done as his rivals attempt to usurp him. He knows that he is the man to beat and it takes a special athlete to relish that role: It\u2019s very easy to say that you knew [I would win] afterwards. I wanna say it too, but I wasn\u2019t too sure, to be honest. This was a very tough race. I actually felt my heart was going to stop, it\u2019s no joke! I actually had pain in my chest, thinking I\u2019m gonna die but it\u2019s gonna be worth it. And here I am, world champion and I\u2019m not dead either. This is only the beginning. I\u2019m very lucky to win. In the future, these guys are going to be even tougher to beat so tomorrow I\u2019ve gotta get up and work again. That\u2019s what I love, always one more. It\u2019s very hard to describe. Norway is a small country, we put a lot of glory in our sport. For me to be showing up at the world stage, it\u2019s better than anything else. Men\u2019s 400m hurdles bronze medalist Abderrahman Samba had his say afterwards and it\u2019s fair to say that he is already looking forward to the next showdown against his rivals: I think I cannot explain this feeling today because it\u2019s amazing. I know third place was not my [desired] place but I say thank you God because three days ago I was not sure to compete or not. This season was very hard for me because I had a lot of injuries. I say thank you God because I\u2019m here tonight and I celebrate with this medal. Actually, I started to prepare for next season now because I\u2019m happy with the medal but I\u2019m not happy with the place. I\u2019m gonna prepare myself for next season now. Warholm has flexed his muscles, contorted his body into a superman pose and now, of course, he is wearing his viking hat. There is surely a long, deserved night of celebrations to come. As the rest of the men stood quietly on the start line, Karsten Warholm bellowed to the camera at the beginning of the race and he attacked the hurdles with similar aggression. Still, Benjamin gave Warholm all he could handle and Samba will be extremely satisfied after injuries this season with a home bronze. Karsten Warholm wins the 400 metres hurdles title in 47.42! Rai Benjamin takes silver, Abderrahman Samba wins bronze. It\u2019s time for the men\u2019s 400 metres hurdles final that the athletics world has been waiting for. This event tends to be on the periphery of the track events, but only four men in history have dipped under 47 seconds and three of them are in this race. It deserves all the attention in the world. The charismatic Norwegian Karsten Warholm (46.92) is the man to beat, but Rai Benjamin of the United States and Abderrahman Samba (both 46.98) will be right behind him. American Kevin Young set the world record of 46.78 in the Barcelona Olympics. How long will it stand? Daniel Stahl, the heavy favourite, wins the discus world title with a throw of 67.59m. Fedrick Dacres of Jamaica takes silver with 66.94 and Austria\u2019s Lukas Weisshaidinger takes bronze with 66.82. Mariya Lasitskene continues her dominance by becoming the first three-time women\u2019s high jump world champion. But what a glorious day for 18 year-old Yaroslava Mahuchikh of Ukraine, who jumps a world junior record of 2.04 at her third attempt to secure silver. Vashti Cunningham takes bronze. Lasitskene is not finished though - she is now going for a personal best of 2.08. As she has done all year, Ajee Wilson dominated much of the race, leading from the front. But from the 100m mark, Halimah Nakaayi kicked hard and true, bursting past Wilson to win the title. And what a storming finish from Raevyn Rogers, who seemed broken for much of the race in 7th place, but she looked like the second coming of Usain Bolt as she sprinted past the group to take the silver medal from her training partner. Halimah Nakaayi of Uganda takes the women\u2019s 800m world title. Raevyn Rogers\u2019 fast finish gives her silver and a bronze for Ajee Wilson. The women\u2019s 800m finalists are on the track. Ajee Wilson of the United States is the woman to beat today. Raevyn Rogers and Natoya Goule have also looked good. Beatrice Chepkoech wins the women\u2019s 3000m steeplechase world title. What a brave, gutsy run from the world record holder. She tore the field apart from the beginning, taking off well under world record pace as she established a huge lead. The Kenyan looked exhausted by the end, but the gap was too big. That is how you snatch a world title. A gutsy silver medal for defending champion Emma Coburn of United States and a bronze for German Gesa Felicitas Krause. Event favourite Beatrice Chepkoech is a long, long way from the rest of the field at the 6 minute mark and it seems like she is determined to make a statement. As she keeps on powering forward, the gap is widening. Some context for Edris\u2019 surprise 5000m victory. The women of the 3000m steeplechase are on the start line now. This should be a great showdown between Kenya\u2019s world record holder Beatrice Chepkoech and defending champion Emma Coburn of the United States. Their teammates, Hyvin Kiyeng and Celliphine Chepteek Chespol of Kenya and American Courtney Frerichs will undoubtedly be strong. We\u2019re going up to 2 metres in the women\u2019s high jump. Yuliya Levchenko, Mariya Lasitskene and Vashti Cunningham have all cleared 1.98 metres with no mistakes. Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Kamila Licwinko are the only other women left. But 2 metres plus is the territory of Lasitskene. We\u2019ll see if anyone can stay with her. Full men\u2019s 5000m results: Mutkar Edris (ETH) - 12:58.85 Selemon Barega (ETH) - 12:59.70 Mohammed Ahmed (CAN) - 13:01.11 What a run! Mohammed Ahmed attempted to push the pace with two laps to go, Jakob Ingebrigtsen tried to separate himself from the field after the bell and then Selemon Barega attempted to push on past the Norwegian for gold. But it was the defending champion, who arrived with the athletics world questioning his form, who rose again to keep his title for another two years. Barega and Ahmed took second and third. Muktar Edris defends his 5000 metres title with a brilliant 12:58.85 run. We are 4000 metres in. The front group is still large, with Ahmed currently leading. It\u2019s fascinating to see the Ethiopean athletes attempting to make the race quicker while the likes of Chelimo and the Ingebrigtsen brothers looking for a slower race. In the women\u2019s high jump, we are up to 1.96m. Neutral athlete Mariya Lasitskene, Ukraine\u2019s Yuliya Levchenko and Vashti Cunningham of the United States are the only three through so far without missing a jump. The wide-open 5000m is about to begin. Telahun Haile Bekele is the world leader today and his Ethiopian compatriot 19 year-old Selemon Barega has been extremely consistent all year. Plenty of eyes will be on his fellow 19 year-old Jakob Ingebrigtsen. It will be fascinating to see how this event develops without Mo Farah. We have our men\u2019s 200m finalists: Noah Lyles (19.86) Alex Quinonez (19.95) Zhenye Xie (20.03) Adam Gemili (20.03) Andre De Grasse (20.08) Ramil Guliyev (20.16) Aaron Brown (20.20) Kyle Greaux (20.24) Can anyone stop Noah Lyles? Andre De Grasse wins the third semi-final with a time of 20.08. As noted by Colin Jackson of the BBC, that was a tired race from the likes of Hughes and Blake. However, De Grasse looks like he has a lot more to give in the final. We\u2019ll see if he is capable of competing with Lyles. We\u2019ll have another packed semi-final to close things off. Britain\u2019s Zharnel Hughes will compete against Andre De Grasse, Yohan Blake and Divine Oduduru for a place in the final. The favourite Noah Lyles just showed exactly why he is the best 200m runner by winning his semi-final in 19.86. Some impressive competition provided by Ecuador\u2019s Alex Quinonez, who refused to let the No 1 establish a big lead and finished with a great time of 19.95. China\u2019s Xie Zhenye took third in 20.03 and is in a good position as a potential fast loser. Adam Gemili after his great run: I think a lot of people have always talked about potential for me and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve quite lived up to what people expected. It\u2019s just another senior chance I\u2019m at and I\u2019m just trying to get through the rounds healthy and run my best and that\u2019s all I can do. If I come off the bend tomorrow and everyone runs past me, then fair play to anyone. I\u2019m just going to give it my all. Not frustration, but there\u2019s the point to prove that I can still run and compete with these guys. And I\u2019m happy. Adam Gemili books his place in the final by winning his semi in 20:03. Great running from the Brit, who dominated the field on the bend and established a big lead. Gemili struggled a bit in the final 30 metres or so, but a great run. Guliyev and Brown also through. The men of the 200m are on the track for the semis. We begin with a stacked semi-final including Britain\u2019s Adam Gemili, Ramil Guliyev and Aaron Brown. This will be tough with only the first two through. In the 110 metres hurdles heats, big guns Grant Holloway and Orlando Ortega are through. Holloway of the United States, the world leader with a run of 12.98 seconds this year, won heat 4 in 13.22 seconds. Spain\u2019s Ortega, the IAAF\u2019s No 1, won heat 5 in 13.15 seconds. Wednesday\u2019s semi-finals will be very open. The women\u2019s high jump final will begin shortly. All eyes will be on neutral athlete Mariya Lasitskene, who equaled her personal best with a jump of 2.06 this year. Her closest rival is Yuliya Levchenko of Ukraine, who has jumped a personal best of 2.02 in 2019. Others to cross two metres this year are Belarusian Karyna Demidik and Ukraine\u2019s Yaroslava Mahuchikh. And that\u2019s it. Daniel Roberts has been disqualified. Oh dear. Replays show that his trailing leg knocked down the hurdle of Ruan De Vries during the race. Hard to see that being overturned. Roberts was one of the medal favourites and recorded the second fastest time of 2019... Back on the track, Britain\u2019s Andrew Pozzi qualifies for the semi-final in third place with a time of 13.53 in heat 3. More dramatically, race leader Daniel Roberts completely clattered the final hurdle but he stumbled over the line in first place. The ever-present Frenchman Pascal Martinot-Lagarde came through in second place and former world champion Sergey Shubenkov triumphed in heat 2 in 13.27 seconds. Britain\u2019s Miguel Francis is out of the 200m semi-finals with a quad injury. Tough news for British medal hopes. Francis had scaled 19.97 this year with a PB of 19.88. Omar McLeod of Jamaica eases through the first 110 metres hurdles heat in 13.17. That looked promising. It\u2019s time for the men\u2019s 110 metres hurdles heats. The big name in the opening heat is Omar McLeod who hasn\u2019t been in the greatest form, but who is a champion. The first four in each heat and then the four fastest losers go through. Get your strides right, people. And here is more on this shambolic world championships from Richard Williams. Here is the full schedule for tonight with timings. Of course, plenty has already happened today. Dina was just out on the track to pick up her first silver medal on the world stage. Earlier in the day, she confirmed herself as the favourite for the 200m title with the highest time of the heats, soaring into the semi-final stage in 22.32 seconds. We go on. Hello! Welcome to another packed night of athletics in front of decidedly non-packed stands. We\u2019ll start with the men\u2019s 110m hurdles heats, then the men of the 200 metres will take centre stage for the semi-finals. Adam Gemili soared through the heats in 20.06 seconds, with the fastest time of the round and also of his season. However, all eyes will be on Noah Lyles of the United States and his dodgy dye job as he looks to consolidate his frightening world leading 19.50 this year by reaching the final. Other challengers include Lyles\u2019 countryman Michael Norman, defending champion Ramil Guliyev of Turkey, Ecuador\u2019s Alex Quinonez and 100m champion Christian Coleman. Alongside Gemili, Britain have two formidable entrants in Miguel Francis and Zharnel Hughes. The finals will come fast. In the women\u2019s high jump final, neutral athlete Mariya Lasitskene is, as usual, the pick of the field as she bids to become the first three-time high jump world champion. Sweden\u2019s Daniel Stahl threw two metres further than anyone else going into the men\u2019s discus final. Meanwhile, the men\u2019s 5000 metres is wide open in the absence of Mo Farah, Kenya\u2019s Beatrice Chepkoech will be vying for the 3000 metres steeplechase title, and in the 800 metres final, Ajee Wilson of the United States will be the woman to beat. The night will conclude with the men\u2019s 400 metres hurdles taking centre stage and, for once, it will garner all the attention as Karsten Warholm, Rai Benjamin and Abderrahman Samba, three of the four men in history to dip under 47 seconds, will resume their rivalry as they fight for gold and, just maybe, a new world record. Here\u2019s Sean Ingle with more on a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d of a world championships so far...",

Joshua Boyle\u2019s legal team suggested on Monday that, while their client could be frustrating \u201cto the point of infuriating\u201d, these personal deficiencies should not be construed as guilt. \u201cHe is not easy to like. He is not a conventional \u2026 by society\u2019s so-called \u2018norms\u2019,\u201d said the lawyer Lawrence Greenspon. \u201cBut [Boyle] is a person who tells the truth, even if it\u2019s not to his own advantage.\u201d Boyle, 36, has pleaded not guilty to 19 charges of assault, sexual assault and unlawful confinement. Wearing a caramel-coloured shirt with a red corduroy vest, Boyle sat in an Ottawa courtroom with his parents and sister, frequently taking notes on a white legal pad. Caitlan Coleman, and her mother Linda, participated in the proceedings through video link at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC. Boyle and Coleman, who married in 2011, were kidnapped during a trip to Afghanistan in 2012. The pair were later transferred to the control of the militant Haqqani network. The couple had three children while in captivity and in November 2017, the family was freed by Pakistani forces. After release, they moved to Ottawa, until Boyle was arrested on 31 December 2017. During closing arguments on Monday, Greenspon highlighted parts of Boyle\u2019s testimony which he admitted were damaging for the accused. Boyle admitted to criticizing his wife, fighting often and striking her once while the two were in captivity, said Greenspon. \u201cHe told the truth \u2026 where adopting a different path would have been much simpler,\u201d he said. Greenspon said that a list of demands from Boyle which Coleman had described (including instructions on her weight, and the frequency of sexual intercourse) was nothing more than a list of \u201cNew Year\u2019s resolutions\u201d. Greenspon also took aim at Coleman\u2019s testimony, suggesting it was \u201cneither credible nor reliable\u201d. \u201cThere is no eyewitness or physical evidence to corroborate any of the 19 charges [against Boyle],\u201d said Greenspon, suggesting the American had provided testimony that had only \u201cmild corroboration\u201d. Before the two sides began closing arguments, the court heard about the erosion of the marriage between Coleman and Boyle as lawyers re-examined witnesses. \u201cI became very angry with Josh that he had brought us [to Afghanistan],\u201d Coleman told the court on Monday, saying the couple fought frequently. Coleman also vigorously denied a suggestion from the defence that she traded chocolate with the guards for \u201cmock execution\u201d of Boyle. \u201cThat is absolutely not correct,\u201d she said. Under examination by the crown, Coleman described feelings of inadequacy both in captivity and while the couple lived in Ottawa. \u201cI struggled with shame \u2026 he was telling me I wasn\u2019t a good enough wife. I felt like I couldn\u2019t possibly be the person he\u2019s always demanding,\u201d said. While much of the early trial focused on the allegations of sexual abuse towards Coleman, the defence has spent recent weeks unearthing documentation and testimony to suggest that the acts Coleman has accused Boyle of were consensual. The trial, which began in March, has been plagued by delays \u2013 including while the court considered whether Coleman\u2019s sexual history should be admitted. Despite a judge\u2019s order not to speak publicly about the case, Coleman granted a number of interviews to Canadian and American media outlets, prompting a number of procedural tangents in the trial. The prosecution will rest its case in the coming days. Boyle has opted for the trial to be overseen by a judge only.",

This would be intended to last for a matter of days, with its only business being to secure a Brexit extension, and would then be dissolved through an election. The talks brought together Corbyn and Swinson, as well as the Westminster leaders of the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru, the Greens and the Independent Group for Change, among other MPs from opposition parties. Whips from the various parties are expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss a series of options to stop no deal. Swinson said this would include \u201cthe possibility of an insurance option of a government of national unity, and including who might be able to lead such a government\u201d. This would be seen as a last-ditch measure, to be brought in only if Boris Johnson appeared to be trying to evade a law obliging him to seek an extension to Brexit if he cannot reach a deal with the EU. There had been speculation that opposition parties could use this week, when the Commons is sitting despite the Conservative conference in Manchester, to trigger a no-confidence vote.

The opposition parties and former Tories believe there is no need to add to the Benn act right now because it is legally watertight. Former attorney general said on Monday that the Queen could dismiss Johnson if he sought to break the law requiring him to seek a Brexit extension.The prime minister would be \u201cgone within five minutes\u201d if he chose to defy parliament by ignoring the legislation, Grieve said. The i newspaper reported this week that the Queen sought legal advice on the circumstances in which she can dismiss a prime minister prior to Johnson\u2019s defeat in the supreme court. Swinson said the Lib Dems had raised the idea of opposition parties passing another measure to speed up the deadline, thus giving more time before the 31 October departure date but other parties had disagreed. Sir Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service, has declared that Brexit is \u201cunsettling\u201d his colleagues and has pledged to go \u201con the road\u201d to listen to concerns, according to a document leaked to SkyNews. However, Swinson said the parties would \u201cuse every opportunity to try and hold this government to account\u201d this week and would focus on using parliamentary mechanisms to seek access to three government reports on Brexit. Ministers published Operation Yellowhammer, an assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit, after a \u201chumble address\u201d motion in parliament. The other three reports sought will be Snow Bunting, about the police response to Brexit; Kingfisher, about the impact on businesses; and Black Swan, which covers the worst-case scenario planning.",

      "body": "<p>With some politicians, their reputations precede them. The main hall was barely half-full when Matt Hancock arrived on stage to give his conference speech and even emptier by the time he had finished. Under the circumstances, a kindness to everyone involved. Not least the health secretary himself.</p> <p>The past 24 hours have not been kind to Hancock. The Man-Boy has built his entire life on never taking a position he can\u2019t later reverse. Often within weeks, if not days. But now he had finally made the potentially career-ending mistake of saying he believed Charlotte Edwardes to be an entirely reliable witness, without first considering the prime minister\u2019s exemplary record with women.</p> <p>Hours later, Boris Johnson had insisted that he had never laid a hand on Edwardes\u2019s thigh. And now Hancock\u2019s job hung in the balance. It\u2019s one thing to make a mess of the NHS. It\u2019s quite another to undermine your party leader.</p> <p>Hancock looked jaded from the start. Normally he can maintain a Tiggerish enthusiasm even when telling people they only have a week to live, but now it was all he could do to force the words out of his mouth.</p> <p>He had no idea whether even six of the 40 hospitals he had been promised really existed and his description of mental health services was pure fantasy. \u201cThe single most important thing that is really important is that we show we love the NHS,\u201d he said. That was about as coherent as he got.</p> <p>Not that anyone else on the hall stage was much better. Esther McVey appeared genuinely amazed that some houses were three-dimensional and were designed by architects using computers. Grant Shapps declared that the collapse of Thomas Cook was proof the UK was ready for a no-deal Brexit, because we had shown we could repatriate people if necessary.</p> <p>It was as if every cabinet minister had been heavily medicated with MDMA to ensure their speeches were either deranged or almost entirely content-free. Just don\u2019t mention the grope. Or the conflict of interest over Jennifer Who?</p> <p>Come the afternoon, it was Sajid Javid\u2019s turn to stoop to fail to conquer. To be fair, the chancellor was slightly more energised as, within minutes, sweat began to pour down his face. Though that could have just been an allergic reaction to the drugs. After sticking to the basic script of \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d \u2013 whatever that was \u2013 and bashing Labour, he finally got to his two policy announcements.</p> <p>The first was yet another red tape challenge \u2013 all governments resurrect this when they\u2019ve run out of any other ideas \u2013 so that after Brexit we could live in a deregulated world where buildings could collapse and people could die of food poisoning. Then he just nicked Labour\u2019s plan for a \u00a310.50 minimum wage by 2024. He had no idea if it was affordable, but he almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be around to find out. There was polite applause. No one in the hall could quite imagine what all the fuss was about.</p> <p>For real passion, you had to go down to the Comedy Store for a Bruges Group fringe. Though the principle emotion on offer was anger rather than humour. Here were the \u201cSpartans\u201d of the European Research Group, the true believers for whom no Brexit deal could ever be too hard.</p> <p>It was all rather confusing. For Johnson, it is the Benn act that is the surrender document. But for the ERG, the real surrender document is the withdrawal agreement. The semiotics of surrender and hierarchy of betrayal in the Tory party really, really matter. To some people.</p> <p>John Redwood got things going with a full-on rant which went down a storm. The vassalage had to end and he wouldn\u2019t rest until Britain was free from the oppressor. He threatened the inhabitants of Calais, insisted the lorry queues were imaginary and proposed people turn over their gardens and open spaces to grow their own food. That would give the EU a bloody nose.</p> <p>Even before he got to his feet, Mark Francois was purple with rage. Having a French name must play havoc with his blood pressure. I\u2019m a reasonable man, he bellowed, spit flecking around his mouth. And if the Brexit deal should happen to include the words \u201cand the EU can go fuck itself\u201d then he would be happy to sign up to it.</p> <p>But as things stood he was not going to back down for anyone. He would carry on fighting long after the war had been lost. The Japanese soldier holed up on a Pacific island in the 1970s. No retreat, baby, no surrender. His correspondence course in war studies had taught him that.</p> <p>No one was going to take him alive.

      "bodyText": "With some politicians, their reputations precede them. The main hall was barely half-full when Matt Hancock arrived on stage to give his conference speech and even emptier by the time he had finished. Under the circumstances, a kindness to everyone involved. Not least the health secretary himself. The past 24 hours have not been kind to Hancock. The Man-Boy has built his entire life on never taking a position he can\u2019t later reverse. Often within weeks, if not days. But now he had finally made the potentially career-ending mistake of saying he believed Charlotte Edwardes to be an entirely reliable witness, without first considering the prime minister\u2019s exemplary record with women. Hours later, Boris Johnson had insisted that he had never laid a hand on Edwardes\u2019s thigh. And now Hancock\u2019s job hung in the balance. It\u2019s one thing to make a mess of the NHS. It\u2019s quite another to undermine your party leader. Hancock looked jaded from the start. Normally he can maintain a Tiggerish enthusiasm even when telling people they only have a week to live, but now it was all he could do to force the words out of his mouth. He had no idea whether even six of the 40 hospitals he had been promised really existed and his description of mental health services was pure fantasy. \u201cThe single most important thing that is really important is that we show we love the NHS,\u201d he said. That was about as coherent as he got. Not that anyone else on the hall stage was much better. Esther McVey appeared genuinely amazed that some houses were three-dimensional and were designed by architects using computers. Grant Shapps declared that the collapse of Thomas Cook was proof the UK was ready for a no-deal Brexit, because we had shown we could repatriate people if necessary. It was as if every cabinet minister had been heavily medicated with MDMA to ensure their speeches were either deranged or almost entirely content-free. Just don\u2019t mention the grope. Or the conflict of interest over Jennifer Who? Come the afternoon, it was Sajid Javid\u2019s turn to stoop to fail to conquer. To be fair, the chancellor was slightly more energised as, within minutes, sweat began to pour down his face. Though that could have just been an allergic reaction to the drugs. After sticking to the basic script of \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d \u2013 whatever that was \u2013 and bashing Labour, he finally got to his two policy announcements. The first was yet another red tape challenge \u2013 all governments resurrect this when they\u2019ve run out of any other ideas \u2013 so that after Brexit we could live in a deregulated world where buildings could collapse and people could die of food poisoning. Then he just nicked Labour\u2019s plan for a \u00a310.50 minimum wage by 2024. He had no idea if it was affordable, but he almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be around to find out. There was polite applause. No one in the hall could quite imagine what all the fuss was about. For real passion, you had to go down to the Comedy Store for a Bruges Group fringe. Though the principle emotion on offer was anger rather than humour. Here were the \u201cSpartans\u201d of the European Research Group, the true believers for whom no Brexit deal could ever be too hard. It was all rather confusing. For Johnson, it is the Benn act that is the surrender document. But for the ERG, the real surrender document is the withdrawal agreement. The semiotics of surrender and hierarchy of betrayal in the Tory party really, really matter. To some people. John Redwood got things going with a full-on rant which went down a storm. The vassalage had to end and he wouldn\u2019t rest until Britain was free from the oppressor. He threatened the inhabitants of Calais, insisted the lorry queues were imaginary and proposed people turn over their gardens and open spaces to grow their own food. That would give the EU a bloody nose. Even before he got to his feet, Mark Francois was purple with rage. Having a French name must play havoc with his blood pressure. I\u2019m a reasonable man, he bellowed, spit flecking around his mouth. And if the Brexit deal should happen to include the words \u201cand the EU can go fuck itself\u201d then he would be happy to sign up to it. But as things stood he was not going to back down for anyone. He would carry on fighting long after the war had been lost. The Japanese soldier holed up on a Pacific island in the 1970s. No retreat, baby, no surrender. His correspondence course in war studies had taught him that. No one was going to take him alive. He\u2019d checked out the David Cameron memoir, found no mention of himself in the index and refused to shell out the \u00a325 asking price. Because no self-respecting Brit ever bought a book in which they didn\u2019t get a mention. Francois\u2019s bookshelves must be a bit sparse. Just copies of the long-since remaindered self-published Michel Barnier: My Part in His Downfall by Francois, M. \u201cHeseltine\u201d. Boo. \u201cHammond\u201d. Boo. \u201cBenn\u201d. Boo. By now the audience\u2019s inner rage had also been channelled. At the very mention of the Guardian or the BBC, several of the more elderly members had to be stretchered out.

To explore the question the team gave 12 female rabbits a two-week course of fluoxetine (trade name Prozac) \u2013 an antidepressant known to reduce the capacity for women to orgasm \u2013 and looked at the number of eggs released after the animals had sex with a male rabbit called Frank. The results, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that rabbits given the antidepressants released 30% fewer eggs than nine rabbits that were not given Prozac but still mated with Frank. Further experiments backed the theory that the drug was affecting ovulation through a mechanism involved in copulation and entailing the nervous system, rather than acting directly on the ovaries or other routes. The team said the results fit their theory that rabbits needed to experience something akin to an orgasm to have a hormonal surge and ovulate, although it is not known if it gives the animals sexual pleasure. They also said their theory was supported by a previous finding that animals that rely on sex-induced hormonal surges for ovulation tended to have a clitoris \u2013 the organ behind the female orgasm \u2013 in a position that meant it was more likely to be stimulated during sex. Pavli\u010dev said it remained unclear exactly how Prozac affected the reflex in rabbits, and that further experiments with other animals was necessary. She added that even if the theory was right, an important question was why is the orgasm still there \u2013 could it be that it had acquired a different function, that there was a function on female health? Elisabeth Lloyd, a professor of biology at Indiana University and author of The Case of the Female Orgasm, praised the study and said it offered support for the team\u2019s theory. She said questions remained, including whether the same muscles and nerve fibres involved in the reflex in rabbits were present in the female orgasm. She also noted that ovulation and orgasm were linked to different hormones in humans, though it was unclear why \u2013 if female orgasm had its roots in ovulation \u2013 orgasms in men and women showed so many overlapping features. Such features, she said, had generally been thought to support the theory that orgasm evolved to reward males for fertilisation, with the female orgasm simply a bonus arising from the way embryos of different sexes develop from a common form. Lloyd and Pavli\u010dev said it might be that the theories could be reconciled, with one potentially explaining the origin of female orgasm and the other indicating why it still existed. Pavli\u010dev added that understanding the role of female orgasm remained important.\u201cMaybe it can direct a little bit more friendly focus on female sexuality rather than just being in [the] service of childbearing,\u201d she said.",

But we want more. We\u2019re still very hungry. Hopefully we can do better than last season.\u201d</p> <p>Vertonghen was in the lineup when Spurs fell to Liverpool in the final in June, a result that frames the club\u2019s Champions League campaign this time out, which began with a 2-2 draw at Olympiakos.

      "bodyText": "When Jan Vertonghen casts his mind back to his first European campaign as a Tottenham player, he remembers the opposition was Lazio, Panathinaikos and Maribor in a Europa League group. It was the 2012-13 season \u2013 his first after joining from Ajax \u2013 and it is fair to say that glamour Champions League ties against Bayern Munich, for which the club are now preparing at their new stadium, were little more than a pipe dream. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way, we shouldn\u2019t forget that,\u201d said Vertonghen. \u201cThat [remembering the opposition from 2012] is the perfect example. But we want more. We\u2019re still very hungry. Hopefully we can do better than last season.\u201d Vertonghen was in the lineup when Spurs fell to Liverpool in the final in June, a result that frames the club\u2019s Champions League campaign this time out, which began with a 2-2 draw at Olympiakos. Spurs want to prove the epic run to the showpiece in Madrid was not a flash in the pan. Yet for Vertonghen, 32, there is a wider question. How much longer does he have at the club? Could this season \u2013 the last on his current contract \u2013 prove to be his swan song? Vertonghen has endured an up-and-down time since the beginning of the season, with emphasis on the down. He was dropped for the opening three matches that led up to the closure of the European transfer window and Mauricio Pochettino has done nothing to hide his irritation at the players who he believed had their minds on other things during that period. Vertonghen is one of those who has been implicated. Recalled to the team on 1 September at Arsenal, Vertonghen was partly at fault for both goals conceded in the 2-2 draw and it was a similar story in Athens against Olympiakos. The hope at the club is that after a difficult start to the season, the battling 2-1 home win over Southampton on Saturday can serve as a turning point, and Vertonghen certainly played his part in the rearguard action with 10 men. \u201cI didn\u2019t play the first three games \u2013 that is a decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to play every game; in that way I was disappointed.

      "body": "<p>The 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China, which will be marked on Tuesday by a mass military parade in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/no-drones-drinking-or-dissent-china-lays-down-law-ahead-of-70th-anniversary\" title=\"\">heart of Beijing</a>, is less a historical commemoration than a political event. The Communist party of China (CPC) has understood the power of history ever since it seized the reins in 1949: in its earliest days, it encouraged citizens to \u201crecall past bitterness\u201d, to make the New China all the sweeter. Xi Jinping understands <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/world/asia/china-mao-zedong-xi-jinping.html\" title=\"\">history\u2019s importance</a> better than any leader since Mao Zedong. Not long after taking power, he warned his colleagues that \u201chistorical nihilism\u201d was an existential threat to the party\u2019s rule on a par with western democracy.</p> <p>The tanks, planes, troops and missiles tell a story: in 1949, the republic\u2019s 17 aircraft were ordered to fly over twice, to make the display look more impressive. This time the west will watch closely as the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-49849858\" title=\"\">People\u2019s Liberation Army</a> unveils new missile, stealth and unmanned vehicle capabilities. The PRC has outlived its big brother, the Soviet Union, and outgrown western economies. Yet it now faces new challenges.</p> <p>Many in China are grateful for the party\u2019s rule. It enjoys a level of support that many democratically elected governments would envy, and not only because of its mammoth propaganda and censorship apparatus. The last 70 years have seen extraordinary progress in lifespan, literacy and incomes: hundreds of millions are no longer living in poverty. Yet people were not lifted out of poverty; they worked their way out. The party banned the family tyranny of forced marriages, but brought the official tyranny of the one-child policy, and even now polices the womb. The advances came at a terrible and wholly unnecessary cost. The famine sparked by Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward took tens of millions of lives. Tens of millions more people were hounded in the Cultural Revolution.</p> <p>Even some of those worst affected see cause to celebrate today. Yet many in China are angry, cynical or despairing. The party-state\u2019s cruelties are both vast and petty. In Xinjiang, perhaps 1.5 million Muslims are locked up in camps which the party euphemistically calls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/xinjiang\" title=\"\">vocational training centres</a>. Meanwhile a six-year-old boy is forced out of school because his father has sought to use China\u2019s own law to <a href=\"https://chinachange.org/2019/09/06/imprisoned-lawyer-wang-quanzhangs-six-year-old-son-once-again-forced-out-of-school/\" title=\"\">uphold basic rights</a>.</p> <p>The party-state\u2019s embrace of pomp and majesty itself has a remarkably brittle quality. The military parade is by invitation only; nearby residents are under order to keep their curtains closed. Elderly \u201cTiananmen mothers\u201d who lost their children in the brutal crackdown on pro-reform demonstrations in 1989 have police guarding their homes today.</p> <p>Since the massacre, the CPC has doubled down on \u201cnational education\u201d, and the construction of a history in which its central role is not class struggle but putting an end to \u201cnational humiliation\u201d. This narrative grows all the more important as the costs of spectacular economic growth \u2013 fractured families, grotesque corruption, inequality and environmental devastation \u2013 are succeeded by its slowing, and as conflict with the US looms large.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Hong Kong, a huge swathe of the population has shown that not everyone is grateful for the party-state\u2019s rule. The 17-week-long protest movement, and the reaction to it, has in turn has boosted support for Taiwan\u2019s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen, in the upcoming elections \u2013 undermining Beijing\u2019s hopes.</p> <p>Under these circumstances, the party is promoting its historical message more assiduously than ever, at a time which, though very different from the past, bears distinct echoes of it. The \u201cpeople\u2019s leader\u201d has overseen growing repression, a resurgence of ideology, and is increasingly invoking the <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3025725/xi-jinping-rallies-china-decades-long-struggle-rise-global\" title=\"\">idea of struggle</a>. China is seeking to reshape the international order once more. Xi is already looking ahead to the republic\u2019s centenary, 30 years hence. Might another story be told by then?</p>",

      "bodyText": "The 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China, which will be marked on Tuesday by a mass military parade in the heart of Beijing, is less a historical commemoration than a political event. The Communist party of China (CPC) has understood the power of history ever since it seized the reins in 1949: in its earliest days, it encouraged citizens to \u201crecall past bitterness\u201d, to make the New China all the sweeter. Xi Jinping understands history\u2019s importance better than any leader since Mao Zedong. Not long after taking power, he warned his colleagues that \u201chistorical nihilism\u201d was an existential threat to the party\u2019s rule on a par with western democracy. The tanks, planes, troops and missiles tell a story: in 1949, the republic\u2019s 17 aircraft were ordered to fly over twice, to make the display look more impressive. This time the west will watch closely as the People\u2019s Liberation Army unveils new missile, stealth and unmanned vehicle capabilities. The PRC has outlived its big brother, the Soviet Union, and outgrown western economies. Yet it now faces new challenges. Many in China are grateful for the party\u2019s rule. It enjoys a level of support that many democratically elected governments would envy, and not only because of its mammoth propaganda and censorship apparatus. The last 70 years have seen extraordinary progress in lifespan, literacy and incomes: hundreds of millions are no longer living in poverty. Yet people were not lifted out of poverty; they worked their way out. The party banned the family tyranny of forced marriages, but brought the official tyranny of the one-child policy, and even now polices the womb. The advances came at a terrible and wholly unnecessary cost. The famine sparked by Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward took tens of millions of lives. Tens of millions more people were hounded in the Cultural Revolution. Even some of those worst affected see cause to celebrate today. Yet many in China are angry, cynical or despairing. The party-state\u2019s cruelties are both vast and petty. In Xinjiang, perhaps 1.5 million Muslims are locked up in camps which the party euphemistically calls vocational training centres. Meanwhile a six-year-old boy is forced out of school because his father has sought to use China\u2019s own law to uphold basic rights. The party-state\u2019s embrace of pomp and majesty itself has a remarkably brittle quality. The military parade is by invitation only; nearby residents are under order to keep their curtains closed. Elderly \u201cTiananmen mothers\u201d who lost their children in the brutal crackdown on pro-reform demonstrations in 1989 have police guarding their homes today. Since the massacre, the CPC has doubled down on \u201cnational education\u201d, and the construction of a history in which its central role is not class struggle but putting an end to \u201cnational humiliation\u201d. This narrative grows all the more important as the costs of spectacular economic growth \u2013 fractured families, grotesque corruption, inequality and environmental devastation \u2013 are succeeded by its slowing, and as conflict with the US looms large. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, a huge swathe of the population has shown that not everyone is grateful for the party-state\u2019s rule. The 17-week-long protest movement, and the reaction to it, has in turn has boosted support for Taiwan\u2019s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen, in the upcoming elections \u2013 undermining Beijing\u2019s hopes. Under these circumstances, the party is promoting its historical message more assiduously than ever, at a time which, though very different from the past, bears distinct echoes of it. The \u201cpeople\u2019s leader\u201d has overseen growing repression, a resurgence of ideology, and is increasingly invoking the idea of struggle. China is seeking to reshape the international order once more. Xi is already looking ahead to the republic\u2019s centenary, 30 years hence. Might another story be told by then?",

Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, described the Conservatives recently as \u201can extreme rightwing faction\u201d; the MP Sam Gyimah said he felt \u201can outcast\u201d in an increasingly intolerant party. I have personally tried to battle on, painstakingly presenting complaints, citing hundreds of incidents of Islamophobia as evidence, yet despite Boris Johnson\u2019s public promise of an inquiry we are no further along the road in dealing with the bigotry and racism within our ranks. Sunday\u2019s meeting was disingenuous, divisive and peppered with dog whistles. Maybe it\u2019s time to acknowledge that it was very suited to today\u2019s Tory party. \u2022 Lady Warsi is a former chairman of the Conservative party",

Not noticeably odd, yet these party members are the tiny group who have done for their country.</p> <p>Over the past decade, their Brexit fever has packed the Commons with Europhobes. These respectable law and order-minded patriots chose a dishonest, disreputable, disgrace of a man for prime minister, who will trash their constitution, mislead their monarch, and disrespect their judges to use \u201cany means necessary\u201d to get anything he wants. These ordinary people have turned into wreckers of what they used to hold dearest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More hyperbole than hard cash, many announcements crumble under scrutiny \u2013 not 40 new hospitals but refurbishment for six</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Observers ask if this party is falling apart in front of our eyes: expelling its MPs, pursuing a no-deal Brexit whose catastrophic effects would render the party unelectable for ever. If they only knew it, the Benn Act \u2013 preventing a no-deal crashout at the end of next month \u2013 saves them from themselves. Some of the 21 banished will not be kept away: Alistair Burt, Dominic Grieve and David Gauke brave the hissing. Any moderates here stay quiet, expect for one businessman tapping me on the shoulder, despairing at what no deal would do to his company. He handed me a paper. I was amazed to find a timeline of the rise of the Nazis. \u201cThat\u2019s how Hitler did it, used the constitution step by step,\u201d he murmured. Even the moderates are extreme.</p> <p>Nothing augurs well for Boris Johnson \u2013 his bounce declining, caught in a pincer between Nigel Farage and an electorate that has for two years now swung away from Brexit. Long-term demographics may sink the party, with no decent victory since 1987. The flight of the young was spelled out brutally by David Willetts, chair of the Resolution Foundation. He found that only 8% of women under 35 would vote Tory. The age at which people vote Tory is rising fast \u2013 over 49s in 2017, now only a majority of those over 51. Age has outstripped class in determining voting habits. \u201cHow to win back younger voters?\u201d they were asking. You can\u2019t, was the conclusion. Because those in their 20s are worse off than their parents, not home owners, spending a third of their income on rents, stuck in insecure gig jobs, young parents crippled by childcare costs. Socially liberal, 20% ethnically diverse, deeply concerned about the climate crisis, they are ignored here. They are remainers and they will not be coming back. Best news for the Tories is the Electoral Reform Society reporting that 9.4 million are missing from the electoral register, mostly the young and renters: David Cameron stopped households and colleges registering them automatically, knowing the young are the enemy. Sorrowfully, the chair of Cameron\u2019s former Witney Young Conservatives rose to say he had only four members.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36aa617c137d0fb6004e97b7d1c1f575a0023fbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36aa617c137d0fb6004e97b7d1c1f575a0023fbd/0_154_4628_2777/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A homeless man on the streets of Manchester, January 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A homeless man on the streets of Manchester, January 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a decade of the most savage erosion of every service, the pre-election spending announced by the chancellor will not begin to repair the damage.

      "bodyText": "Look at the people here in Manchester at the Tory party conference, stare into their eyes and they look much as they always did \u2013 ordinary home counties folk, small business people, plus a few sharp-suited would-be spads. Not noticeably odd, yet these party members are the tiny group who have done for their country. Over the past decade, their Brexit fever has packed the Commons with Europhobes. These respectable law and order-minded patriots chose a dishonest, disreputable, disgrace of a man for prime minister, who will trash their constitution, mislead their monarch, and disrespect their judges to use \u201cany means necessary\u201d to get anything he wants. These ordinary people have turned into wreckers of what they used to hold dearest. Observers ask if this party is falling apart in front of our eyes: expelling its MPs, pursuing a no-deal Brexit whose catastrophic effects would render the party unelectable for ever. If they only knew it, the Benn Act \u2013 preventing a no-deal crashout at the end of next month \u2013 saves them from themselves. Some of the 21 banished will not be kept away: Alistair Burt, Dominic Grieve and David Gauke brave the hissing. Any moderates here stay quiet, expect for one businessman tapping me on the shoulder, despairing at what no deal would do to his company. He handed me a paper. I was amazed to find a timeline of the rise of the Nazis. \u201cThat\u2019s how Hitler did it, used the constitution step by step,\u201d he murmured. Even the moderates are extreme. Nothing augurs well for Boris Johnson \u2013 his bounce declining, caught in a pincer between Nigel Farage and an electorate that has for two years now swung away from Brexit. Long-term demographics may sink the party, with no decent victory since 1987. The flight of the young was spelled out brutally by David Willetts, chair of the Resolution Foundation. He found that only 8% of women under 35 would vote Tory. The age at which people vote Tory is rising fast \u2013 over 49s in 2017, now only a majority of those over 51. Age has outstripped class in determining voting habits. \u201cHow to win back younger voters?\u201d they were asking. You can\u2019t, was the conclusion. Because those in their 20s are worse off than their parents, not home owners, spending a third of their income on rents, stuck in insecure gig jobs, young parents crippled by childcare costs. Socially liberal, 20% ethnically diverse, deeply concerned about the climate crisis, they are ignored here. They are remainers and they will not be coming back. Best news for the Tories is the Electoral Reform Society reporting that 9.4 million are missing from the electoral register, mostly the young and renters: David Cameron stopped households and colleges registering them automatically, knowing the young are the enemy. Sorrowfully, the chair of Cameron\u2019s former Witney Young Conservatives rose to say he had only four members. After a decade of the most savage erosion of every service, the pre-election spending announced by the chancellor will not begin to repair the damage. More hyperbole than hard cash, many announcements crumble under scrutiny \u2013 not 40 new hospitals but refurbishment for six. \u201cA relatively gradual increase in spending,\u201d said the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Welcome, yes, but Sajid Javid\u2019s offer of \u201ca decade of renewal\u201d will be greeted with wry disbelief, too late to change public perceptions when voters see the threadbare services around them. Non-stop repetition of \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism only reminds people how deeply this party has riven the country. Matching Labour\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d was an eye-catching political necessity. But the chancellor\u2019s \u201cBrexit red tape challenge\u201d against \u201coverbearing bureaucracy\u201d will sound a klaxon about plans for a post-Brexit removal of protections for workers, food, finance and consumer safety. Everything else is forgotten, the \u00a337bn taken out of benefits gone for ever, as universal credit keeps tipping more families into penury; with child poverty approaching 40%, unmatched since the war. Taking a breather from the fetid airlessness of this conference where all intellectual oxygen has been sucked out by \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, I found Coffee4Craig, a small haven for the homeless, open two hours an evening for food, clothes and advice. Risha Lancaster opened it when her brother died on the streets from a heroin overdose. Among the old-timers, such as the woman in the wheelchair who comes for supper every night, she is alarmed to find so many more newcomers: she tries to divert them towards early help. \u201cThey get beaten up, everything stolen, especially shoes and ID. Everything spirals out of control.\u201d The five-week wait for universal credit, along with benefits sanctions, tips many on to the street. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to send them for mental health, so many addiction services shut down. There\u2019s no beds.\u201d Several have stumbled in to die here, turned out by hospitals. Here is the 54-year-old woman in a flowery blouse thrown out by her landlord, and a live-in chef sacked with no benefits for rent. \u201cNot the council\u2019s fault, after all the cuts to their funds. They do all they can.\u201d The end of austerity will be a long time arriving here, if ever. Rough sleepers are only the most visible sign of the disintegration of all key services \u2013 from housing to A&amp;E waiting times, and benefit levels that no longer keep working families\u2019 heads above poverty. None of this is anywhere on Johnson\u2019s one nation horizon. He may think spaffing some last-minute cash has shot Labour\u2019s fox. I doubt many voters will think austerity is over until there are no homeless in their supermarket doorways, until they can get a GP appointment, schools stop begging for pens, and the government takes the climate emergency seriously \u2013 virtually unmentioned here. Brexit stirs strong passions, but come an election the state of the nation counts for more \u2013 and the Tories will have no cover for their abysmal decade of strife and decay. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

However, on the conference hall floor, activists were concerned about how the negative press about the prime minister and his relationship with women would play out.</p> <p>Annabel Tall, the Conservatives\u2019 prospective parliamentary candidate for Bath, said: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been charged, he hasn\u2019t been found guilty.

The timing of it makes it look like it\u2019s politically motivated.\u201d</p> <p>About the possible long-term effect of the alleged incident, Michaelene Holder-March, the founder of the BME small business group for the Conservatives, said: \u201cWhen you look at the Conservative party there\u2019s no doubt about it, we have a lot of females in leadership, including Theresa May, and coming out with this at this time \u2013 it\u2019s to undermine the whole ethos and where we are going. It seems people are searching for a reason to undermine the party at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Tall said she was worried it might have a longer-term impact among female voters. \u201cIt\u2019s so divisive. People start to make value judgments. It probably will have a damaging impact.\u201d</p> <p>However, Toby Young, an associate editor of the Spectator, laughed off the allegation. He told an event at conference: \u201cBack then at the Spectator, in those raucous days, people complained if Boris didn\u2019t put his hand on their knee.

      "bodyText": "Speeches were given by ministers, activists crammed into overheated meeting rooms, panels were under way on all manner of topics. Yet 24 hours after the journalist Charlotte Edwardes made an explosive allegation that Boris Johnson had inappropriately grabbed her thigh, the Conservatives were still dealing with that revelation by trying not to talk about it. Cabinet secretaries stuck to scripts about \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d and the opportunities for the country after leaving the EU, but at event after event politicians were asked by journalists to give their thoughts on the alleged incident, which Edwardes says took place 20 years ago at a lunch when Johnson was editor of the Spectator. A terse Nicky Morgan \u2013 the culture secretary and one of the Tories\u2019 most senior women \u2013 said at one fringe event: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s spokesman has been very clear. There is no truth in these allegations. I have no further comment to add.\u201d Just an hour earlier she had been asked the same thing. The journalist\u2019s question was met with groans from activists, clearly irritated the story had run into a second day. The housing minister, Esther McVey, questioned whether the alleged incident happened. \u201cWhat I hear is he\u2019s categorically denied that and usually Boris doesn\u2019t really say too much about anything, so I think you need to go back and check whether it did happen,\u201d she said. One minister said in a private meeting that Johnson\u2019s alleged \u201cpinching of a knee\u201d \u2013 Edwardes claimed it was her inner thigh \u2013 was \u201cpriced in\u201d by voters and they did not think it would damage him in the long term. However, on the conference hall floor, activists were concerned about how the negative press about the prime minister and his relationship with women would play out. Annabel Tall, the Conservatives\u2019 prospective parliamentary candidate for Bath, said: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been charged, he hasn\u2019t been found guilty. Someone could brush against my shoulder now. My interpretation can then lead to people making huge value judgments. People are making a huge value judgment now about unsubstantiated allegations. If this has happened to this woman it needs to be taken very seriously.\u201d Tall added: \u201cThe timing of this makes me uncomfortable. Why not mention anything for 20 years and bring it up now? The timing of it makes it look like it\u2019s politically motivated.\u201d About the possible long-term effect of the alleged incident, Michaelene Holder-March, the founder of the BME small business group for the Conservatives, said: \u201cWhen you look at the Conservative party there\u2019s no doubt about it, we have a lot of females in leadership, including Theresa May, and coming out with this at this time \u2013 it\u2019s to undermine the whole ethos and where we are going. It seems people are searching for a reason to undermine the party at the moment.\u201d Tall said she was worried it might have a longer-term impact among female voters. \u201cIt\u2019s so divisive. People start to make value judgments. It probably will have a damaging impact.\u201d However, Toby Young, an associate editor of the Spectator, laughed off the allegation. He told an event at conference: \u201cBack then at the Spectator, in those raucous days, people complained if Boris didn\u2019t put his hand on their knee. Times really have changed.\u201d Fatigue among activists with questions about Johnson\u2019s personal conduct set in by mid-afternoon. When the Mirror\u2019s political editor, Pippa Crerar, asked if Johnson was responsible for the coarsening of political debate using words such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d, and for mentioning the murdered MP Jo Cox in the context of Brexit, she was booed by the crowd. Johnson has strenuously denied the incident happened and continued to tour receptions at conference as planned. At the private Women 2 Win event, to encourage women to stand as Conservatives, he was met politely at the door by the co-founder Anne Jenkin. He got laughs and cheers from the crowd when he said: \u201cAt an election, whenever that happens, I want to see more women elected to parliament. When I ran City Hall it was virtually a feminocracy.\u201d Pointing to his former deputy Victoria Borwick, he said: \u201cVictoria, my wonderful deputy mayor, can testify to that.\u201d However, not all activists were agitating to move the debate on or dismiss Edwardes\u2019 allegations out of hand.

      "bodyText": "A report by the parliamentary budget office (PBO) has revealed that the tax cuts legislated by the government overwhelmingly benefit higher income earners. It opens the budget to risks of an economic downturn given a narrowing of the tax base and projections within the budget that are very much based on an optimistic outlook for the economy over the next decade. One of the best aspects of the minority parliament during Julia Gillard\u2019s prime ministership was the creation of the parliamentary budget office. It provides an independent view of the budget because, unlike the Treasury, it does not report to a government minister; it reports to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the president of the Senate. Last week the PBO produced its annual \u201cmedian budget projections\u201d report, which provides some pretty forthright commentary on what the Treasury suggests the future will look like. The PBO is unable to make its own projections \u2013 it has to use the economic parameters Treasury estimates \u2013 but it is allowed to assess those parameters. The clear issue with the budget \u2013 as I noted at the time \u2013 is that its economic projections are very optimistic. As the PBO notes, \u201cthe projections over the medium term are predicated on above-trend economic growth for much of the period and return-to-trend wages growth by the end of the forward estimates period\u201d. The forecasts for GDP growth are rather instructive: Over the next 11 years, the Treasury estimates that our economy will grow on average by 2.9% each year \u2013 a level that has been reached just twice in the past 10 years. And let us acknowledge that the Treasury has not been wonderfully prescient on GDP growth of late. Its first prediction for GDP growth in 2018-19, made in the 2015 budget, was for 3.5% growth. Over time this was revised down. But even in the 2018-19 budget the Treasury was still predicting 3% growth for 2018-19. It ended up being 1.9%: So predicting a five-year run of 3% growth from 2021-22 to 2025-26 is pretty ambitious. But where the PBO really comes to the fore is its analysis of the tax cuts over the next decade. Firstly, it notes that the government\u2019s decision to cap tax revenue at 23.9% of GDP has placed greater risks on the budget. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Remember, the tax cap is a purely political measure with zero basis in economics. There is no economic theory that suggests if the government\u2019s tax revenue rises above a certain percentage of GDP then economic growth falls \u2013 and 23.9% of GDP is extremely low compared with other advanced nations. It is a political measure designed to be able to suggest the ALP are doing something bad if their policies would see tax rise above that. The biggest problem with the tax cap is that the government\u2019s income tax cuts are designed to keep tax revenue below that level over the next decade. But at the same time it projects better growth than we have seen for more than 10 years. Now, had the government allowed tax to rise above that \u201ccap\u201d it would, as the PBO notes, \u201cpartly shield\u201d the budget projections from \u201cthe risk of adverse economic shocks.\u201d But when you set a cap and project to reach that cap only with the most optimistic predictions, it \u201cremoves this buffer\u201d. As the PBO notes, \u201cany weakness in tax receipts before 2029\u201330 would directly affect the budget balance\u201d. As it is the budget figures have income tax revenue rising to a post-GST high of 12% of GDP: This might seem odd, given the tax cuts that have been legislated \u2013 surely income tax should fall? But here we discover the big lie of the tax cuts. They were sold as counters to bracket creep. The prime minister, for example, told parliament in November last year that the tax cuts would mean \u201cAustralians going to work today on a middle income over the next 10 years will not see bracket creep, the vast majority of them, for their entire working lives\u201d. The PBO report shows that the prime minister\u2019s statement was completely wrong. Bracket creep is not just going into a higher marginal tax bracket because of a wage rise, but also includes the increase in average tax rates within a tax bracket \u2013 because more of your income is taxed at your highest marginal tax rate. And, as has long been known, bracket creep always affects those on lower incomes the most because their wage increases cause a higher percentage of the income to be taxed at a higher marginal rate than is the case with high income earners. The government has removed the 37% tax bracket on incomes of $90,000-$180,000 to be replaced with a 30% bracket on $45,000 to $200,000 in July 2024. But median income taxpayers were not likely to reach $90,000 until at least 2034-35, and those currently earning $90,000 were not in danger of reaching $180,000 until 2042-43: So the tax cuts were not really about removing bracket creep \u2013 even using the prime minister\u2019s narrow definition of preventing people going into a higher tax bracket. They were about delivering tax cuts to wealthy people. The PBO\u2019s analysis found that \u201cindividuals in the second and third quintiles (together spanning the taxable income range $20,001 to $58,000), are expected to face the largest effects of bracket creep, while the benefits of the tax cuts are greater at higher quintiles\u201d: For those earning over $90,000, bracket creep is expected to cause individuals\u2019 average tax rate to rise by 3.3% over the next 10 years, while for median income earners it will see a 6.3% rise. And yet the impact of the tax cuts only outweighs the effect of bracket creep for those earning above $90,000 \u2013 i.e. in the top 20% of income earners: For everyone else, the average tax rate will rise. For those in the second-lowest quintile, the average tax rate is set to nearly double from 5.3% to 9.9%. It all adds up to a run of budget surpluses based on optimistic economic projections and poor-to-median income earners paying higher rates of tax, with increased risks should we have an economic downturn in the next 10 years. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg says an Indigenous voice to parliament should be formed by a network of Indigenous communities across the country, in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach that would ensure First Nation voices had a direct say to parliament. Bragg, who has strongly endorsed constitutional recognition, will use a speech in Canberra today to build the case for an Indigenous voice to parliament, outlining a model that he says would honour the Uluru Statement of the Heart, while also upholding parliamentary sovereignty. Saying he had been \u201cunashamedly vocal\u201d in his support for constitutional recognition, Bragg said consulting Indigenous people on the laws that were relevant to them as proposed by the Uluru statement was both a \u201cgood and fair\u201d idea. He said that ensuring that Indigenous voices were heard by parliament did not mean \u201ccreating a third chamber\u201d of parliament, as had been suggested by critics. In a speech to a Sietar conference on the celebration of Indigenous knowledge on Tuesday, Bragg will propose a voice to parliament that builds on the \u201cSpeaking for Country\u201d model put forward in a paper written by the former chair of the government\u2019s Indigenous advisory council Warren Mundine. \u201cThis bottom-up approach involves establishing local and regional bodies for the various Indigenous communities around Australia,\u201d Bragg says. \u201cIt would be for each of these communities to identify a structure that will enable a local or regional body to best represent its community. Indigenous communities around Australia are very different. So their needs are different, and the kind of local or regional body that can help address these needs will be different.\u201d Once these groups had been formed, the various local and regional bodies would then voluntarily affiliate to create a national body that would facilitate communication between the national parliament and government and the local Indigenous peoples. \u201cThe role of the national body, on this model, will be a bit like a post box or a conduit,\u201d Bragg says. \u201cIt will be the pathway through which the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament are able to speak directly to the local bodies. \u201cThe government and the Parliament will then have a one-stop-shop that they can go to in order to receive advice from Indigenous people.\u201d Bragg said the \u201cgenius\u201d of the proposed model was that the parliament and government would be able to hear directly from the local communities affected by a proposed law or policy. \u201cIn this way, we\u2019ll get a system through which local communities can be heard directly by the Parliament.

The detailed proposal being put forward by Bragg comes as the Coalition prepares to announce a \u201cco-design\u201d process for the voice to parliament, for which the government has allocated $7.3m. After the Indigenous MP Ken Wyatt was appointed as the minister for Indigenous affairs following the May election, he promised to work towards holding a referendum on recognition within three years. Wyatt has signalled he wants to persist with creating some model of the voice from the Uluru statement, but indicated a representative body might be legislated, rather than enshrined in the constitution, which was the position outlined in the Uluru process. Conservatives within the Coalition are opposed to a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, arguing it could divide Australians on racial grounds. Bragg said it would be \u201cna\u00efve\u201d to think the issue of constitutional recognition would not provide internal challenges, but said the Liberal party was \u201cused to opening the batting on difficult issues\u201d, pointing to its success on abolishing the White Australia policy, opening trade with Japan in 1957 and delivering the Indigenous referendum of 1967. \u201cI believe we Liberals are good at big changes because we take the forgotten people or the quiet Australians on the journey,\u201d Bragg said. \u201cConstitutional recognition is too important to get wrong, and too important to rush.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Greens leader Richard Di Natale says Labor has learned \u201call the wrong lessons\u201d from its election defeat, warning that a retreat from action on climate change will see it lose the next election. Ahead of a new parliamentary inquiry into future employment for regional areas that begins hearings on Tuesday, Di Natale said neither major party had been prepared to have an \u201chonest conversation\u201d with workers in the coal industry who would be affected by the transition away from fossil fuels. \u201cPeople were given a choice between a party of climate change deniers \u2026 and another party that had different positions on issues like coalmining depending on what audience they were talking to,\u201d Di Natale said. \u201cI don\u2019t accept for a moment that the election result was a vindication of the government\u2019s pro-coal position [and] if Labor MPs think that their weak position on climate change cost them the election result, well, they better be prepared to lose the next election, and the next one after that. \u201cIt looks like Labor has learned all the wrong lessons in the election campaign and they are now walking away from climate change.\u201d Following the May election defeat, Labor has been revisiting its policies on climate change and the coal industry, with several MPs attributing swings against Labor in blue-collar communities to the party\u2019s divisions over the Adani coalmine. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said there was a perception that Labor was \u201csending mixed messages on the coal industry\u201d and has called for the party to refocus on jobs and the economy. The party\u2019s shadow resources minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, has said it was a \u201chuge error\u201d for Labor not to talk about coal because of a fear that it would cost city seats. But Di Natale said the coal industry was on track to shut down regardless of the two major parties positions, and accused the Coalition and Labor of giving coal communities \u201cfalse hope\u201d that they had a future. \u201cRight now action on climate change means creating long-term sustainable jobs, it means building investment, it means long-term jobs and investment rather than what we are seeing at the moment which is a government determined to prop up \u2026 the coal industry, where even some of the biggest players are saying the era of coal is over,\u201d Di Natale said. When asked if there needed to be more empathy shown by those wanting a rapid transition away from fossil fuels for those individuals whose jobs would be affected by the end of the coal industry, Di Natale said the problem was on those trying to artificially prolong the life of the industry. He rejected criticism of the anti-Adani convoy that travelled through regional Queensland seats, saying he believed that the protesters had been well received. \u201cI think there is definitely a need for more empathy from the climate deniers, from the sceptics, and from the government, and indeed those members in the Labor party that are pretending these issues are not happening and giving them false hope \u2026 they are the ones who are lacking empathy,\u201d Di Natale said. \u201cThe reality is the economy is dependent on a healthy environment and vice versa \u2013 when we get these transitions right, we will end up with a cleaner environment, a more stable climate and tens of thousands of jobs, and if we don\u2019t, we end up with a climate catastrophe and people with no long-term future.\u201d Di Natale said the parliamentary inquiry into future employment for regional areas, which will begin public hearings in Melbourne on Tuesday, would look at ensuring workers affected by the transition from fossil fuels to renewables were given \u201cevery opportunity\u201d to find meaningful work in new industries. He also said the inquiry would be an opportunity for the Labor party to declare its vision for jobs in regional communities, saying they needed to \u201cmake a choice\u201d on the coal industry. \u201cIt [Labor] either stands with the climate deniers and coal huggers in the Coalition, or it stands with the community and scientists and the Greens and acknowledges the clear reality that we have to get our emissions down, which means no more coal, oil and gas projects. \u201cLabor clearly needs to make a choice \u2013 are they going to continue to be Liberal lite \u2026 or embrace what this future could be for people?\u201d",

Levonorgestrel, an oral emergency contraception that is effective up to 72 hours after intercourse, has been available over the counter since 2004. Ulipristal acetate, which has continued efficacy up to 120 hours or five days after intercourse, has been available over the counter since February 2017. In Queensland, according to Women\u2019s Health Queensland Wide, the cost is between $20 and $50. Hope said the lack of sex education in high school, or lack of a consistent sex education program, as well a lack of advertising about the drugs, had contributed to poor awareness. Both forms of emergency contraception were cleared for advertising by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and Hope said targeted advertising, particularly social media advertising aimed at women of reproductive age, would increase awareness. At the moment, she said, most young women come by information about emergency contraception through \u201cosmosis\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s that woman-to-woman network,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s really important that young men know as well. This information and awareness should not be just the domain of women, although arguably the consequences are greater for us so we give it more credence.\u201d Hope said many young men who were approached by the researchers to fill out the survey responded by handing the iPad to a female friend, because they thought it was a female issue. Hope said emergency contraception should be taught as part of a broader safe sex curriculum. \u201cI think we are aware that not all sex is going to be safe even if people intend for it to be safe upfront,\u201d she said. \u201cContraceptive failure happens. Sexual assault happens. We want people to know that there are options afterwards if that happens to be the case.\u201d Queensland child safety, youth and women\u2019s minister Di Farmer said the government received a recommendation on Friday from Griffith University to include information about emergency contraception on its Safer Schoolies website, and was considering that recommendation. \u201cThe Palaszczuk Government will always take expert advice on the health and wellbeing of young Queenslanders seriously, and the topic of safe sex is no exception,\u201d she said.",

Earlier, McGee had been unperturbed by the weather. \u201cThese blokes don\u2019t care,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s rainy, put a jacket on. If it\u2019s windy, put your head down.

McGee makes up for his lack of visuals by monitoring a live feed and the WhatsApp group \u2013 an impressive feat of multi-tasking as he speeds around the winding circuit \u2013 while a mechanic in the backseat relays orders to staff via radio. At one point McGee\u2019s concentration is interrupted by a phone call from his son in Australia. \u201cI\u2019m just a little busy right now,\u201d he offers apologetically.</p> <p>The downpour is unceasing. \u201cIt has not stopped raining all day,\u201d says McGee, dry inside the team car as his riders endure the conditions. Despite the adverse weather, the circuit is lined with spectators. \u201cIt is like a Tour de France day in July,\u201d the coach observes. \u201cExcept it\u2019s wet and they have their wellies on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aefd7e5676a7c5174a1ef6e20f7880154ad5623\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aefd7e5676a7c5174a1ef6e20f7880154ad5623/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The windscreen wiper of the Australia team car works overtime\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The windscreen wiper of the team car works overtime.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieran Pender/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More Australians drop as the kilometres tick down, but McGee is unconcerned. \u201cWe are burning them in the right order.\u201d Suddenly the coach spots Clarke on the road ahead, distanced from the back of the peloton. \u201cFuck,\u201d he yells. Clarke\u2019s departure from the race with 40kms remaining was not part of the plan. \u201cI got a hunger flat,\u201d the rider explains through the car window. McGee regains composure: \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a few cards here.\u201d</p> <p>When Haas drops a kilometre later, just two Australians \u2013 Matthews and Haig \u2013 remain in the front group. The team\u2019s prospects have swiftly diminished, but while the duo is in the race a medal is still possible. \u201cIt is pretty much all mental from here \u2013 you just have to back yourself,\u201d says McGee.</p> <p>With three laps to go the race has become a battle of attrition, and barely a quarter of entrants have survived. When two riders attack, McGee ponders changing the colour scheme from yellow to red, but decides to keep it at \u201cbe careful\u201d. A trio then launches from the peloton to join the breakaway. \u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he spits, after the escapees establish a 30-second advantage. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the numbers to bring it back.\u201d McGee is visibly deflated. \u201cThere is nothing we can do but sit and hope that another country chases.\u201d</p> <p>Haig cracks with 18kms to go, while highly-rated Mathieu van der Poel suddenly falls back from the breakaway. The favourites are dropping like flies; Julian Alaphilippe is another to go. \u201cHow the mighty have fallen,\u201d says McGee, stunned by the number of big names who will not be making it to the finish. When Matthews loses contact with the chase group, with several kilometres remaining, Australia\u2019s medal hopes are extinguished.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/29/mads-pedersen-uci-world-championship-elite-mens-road-race\">Mads Pedersen wins men\u2019s elite road race at sodden world championships</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The race is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/29/mads-pedersen-uci-world-championship-elite-mens-road-race\">ultimately won by an unheralded 23-year-old Dane, Mads Petersen</a>. Watching the sprint finish on the tiny screen in the team car, McGee is in disbelief. \u201cThis sport, hey? Brilliant, isn\u2019t it.\u201d Matthews rolls across the line in 24<sup>th</sup> place. Of the eight Australians who began the race in Leeds almost seven hours earlier, he is the only one to finish.</p> <h2>\u201c<strong>How\u2019s that for team culture?\u201d</strong></h2> <p><em>4.38pm, Sunday: team bus</em></p> <p>Back on the bus, the team are enjoying post-race pizza as they swap notes about a tough day in the office. \u201cThat was,\u201d Haas says, \u201can experience.\u201d After completing his media duties, Matthews arrives looking shell-shocked and immediately heads for the shower. He emerges from the steam 10 minutes later, still bearing a vacant expression. \u201cI tried to attack on the last lap, and all of a sudden I was going backwards rather than forwards,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Once the bus arrives back at the accommodation, McGee immediately starts debriefing. Most of the riders have a beer in hand, for some their first alcoholic beverage of the year.

The team\u2019s support staff, all employees of Australian-registered World Tour team Mitchelton-Scott, busy themselves preparing bikes, bottles and nutritional supplies. Mitchelton-Scott provided the team bus, as many other World Tour teams have for their respective nations. The blend of club and country offers an odd aesthetic; Australia\u2019s riders even have different helmets, reflecting the various sponsors of their trade teams. McGee has a final chat with his squad, but there are no rousing words of motivation. \u201cThis does not change anything for us,\u201d he says of the late course revision. \u201cIf anything it plays to our strengths.\u201d Outside the bus, Jones, having returned the inflatable kangaroo, exudes an aura of calm. \u201cThere is no point telling them what to do,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who have to do it.\u201d The race rolls out 10 minutes behind schedule. McGee follows in the team car, while support staff scatter to different points of the route to offer bottles, feed bags and information. On the team bus, Jones has a live stream on one phone and is providing updates to the team WhatsApp group on another. Once an initial breakaway has formed, the commentator advises that, right on schedule, \u201cDennis moves to the front.\u201d Jones reacts with a yell that reverberates around the bus: \u201cGame on!\u201d The rain becomes heavier; the conditions are so bad that the helicopters which usually provide television footage have been grounded. \u201cThis is going to be such an epic day,\u201d says Jones, with boyish enthusiasm. Earlier, McGee had been unperturbed by the weather. \u201cThese blokes don\u2019t care,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s rainy, put a jacket on. If it\u2019s windy, put your head down. These are hardened, battle-ready bike riders. The weather is not an issue.\u201d \u201cHow the mighty have fallen\u201d 12.57pm, Sunday: team car, on-course with 124kms to go As the peloton enters the Harrogate circuit after four hours on-course, Dennis becomes the first Australian rider to abandon. \u201cWe are on track,\u201d says McGee. \u201cWe completed the first half to plan, and the stage is set for a big finish.\u201d The team car convoy is ordered by UCI\u2019s country rankings; Australia, in ninth, are well behind the back of the peloton. McGee makes up for his lack of visuals by monitoring a live feed and the WhatsApp group \u2013 an impressive feat of multi-tasking as he speeds around the winding circuit \u2013 while a mechanic in the backseat relays orders to staff via radio. At one point McGee\u2019s concentration is interrupted by a phone call from his son in Australia. \u201cI\u2019m just a little busy right now,\u201d he offers apologetically. The downpour is unceasing. \u201cIt has not stopped raining all day,\u201d says McGee, dry inside the team car as his riders endure the conditions. Despite the adverse weather, the circuit is lined with spectators. \u201cIt is like a Tour de France day in July,\u201d the coach observes. \u201cExcept it\u2019s wet and they have their wellies on.\u201d More Australians drop as the kilometres tick down, but McGee is unconcerned. \u201cWe are burning them in the right order.\u201d Suddenly the coach spots Clarke on the road ahead, distanced from the back of the peloton. \u201cFuck,\u201d he yells. Clarke\u2019s departure from the race with 40kms remaining was not part of the plan. \u201cI got a hunger flat,\u201d the rider explains through the car window. McGee regains composure: \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a few cards here.\u201d When Haas drops a kilometre later, just two Australians \u2013 Matthews and Haig \u2013 remain in the front group. The team\u2019s prospects have swiftly diminished, but while the duo is in the race a medal is still possible. \u201cIt is pretty much all mental from here \u2013 you just have to back yourself,\u201d says McGee. With three laps to go the race has become a battle of attrition, and barely a quarter of entrants have survived. When two riders attack, McGee ponders changing the colour scheme from yellow to red, but decides to keep it at \u201cbe careful\u201d. A trio then launches from the peloton to join the breakaway. \u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he spits, after the escapees establish a 30-second advantage. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the numbers to bring it back.\u201d McGee is visibly deflated. \u201cThere is nothing we can do but sit and hope that another country chases.\u201d Haig cracks with 18kms to go, while highly-rated Mathieu van der Poel suddenly falls back from the breakaway. The favourites are dropping like flies; Julian Alaphilippe is another to go. \u201cHow the mighty have fallen,\u201d says McGee, stunned by the number of big names who will not be making it to the finish. When Matthews loses contact with the chase group, with several kilometres remaining, Australia\u2019s medal hopes are extinguished. The race is ultimately won by an unheralded 23-year-old Dane, Mads Petersen. Watching the sprint finish on the tiny screen in the team car, McGee is in disbelief. \u201cThis sport, hey? Brilliant, isn\u2019t it.\u201d Matthews rolls across the line in 24th place. Of the eight Australians who began the race in Leeds almost seven hours earlier, he is the only one to finish. \u201cHow\u2019s that for team culture?\u201d 4.38pm, Sunday: team bus Back on the bus, the team are enjoying post-race pizza as they swap notes about a tough day in the office. \u201cThat was,\u201d Haas says, \u201can experience.\u201d After completing his media duties, Matthews arrives looking shell-shocked and immediately heads for the shower. He emerges from the steam 10 minutes later, still bearing a vacant expression. \u201cI tried to attack on the last lap, and all of a sudden I was going backwards rather than forwards,\u201d he says. Once the bus arrives back at the accommodation, McGee immediately starts debriefing. Most of the riders have a beer in hand, for some their first alcoholic beverage of the year. The team take turns reflecting on their individual performances, in the order they exited the race, before others add commentary. Docker does not mince his words: \u201cIt was fucking brutal.\u201d The tone is broadly positive; the riders feel there was little they could have done differently. McGee encourages constructive criticism, listening intently as Clarke outlines the challenges they faced receiving food from the roadside. \u201cIs there a way we can do that better next year?\u201d he asks. The team ponder how to overcome the conditions. \u201cEvery single person was cold,\u201d says Haig. \u201cIt is not a coincidence that a Scandinavian won.\u201d McGee suggests \u201cthere\u2019s no preparing for a day like that\u201d, but Jones is more pensive. \u201cYou can say it is down to the weather, but that\u2019s merely a problem we haven\u2019t solved,\u201d he says. \u201cYet.\u201d Just like the prior evening, attention finally switches to Matthews. \u201cI want to say thank you,\u201d he says. \u201cLast night we outlined a plan, and today we executed.\u201d Matthews may not be a typical leader, but his teammates are transfixed. \u201cIt was miserable out there today, but I did not hear one person complain. We stuck together \u2013 how\u2019s that for team culture?\u201d The other riders applaud, but Matthews is not finished. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win, but we tried our best. Win, lose or draw, we have had an awesome day.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rudy Giuliani, the personal lawyer to Donald Trump, has been subpoenaed by House congressional committees to produce documents related to his and the US president\u2019s attempt to coerce Ukraine into meddling in American democracy. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, has emerged as a pivotal figure in the Ukraine scandal that engulfed Trump in recent days and led Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry. On Monday the Democratic chairs of the intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees issued a subpoena to Giuliani, requiring him to hand over materials relevant to the impeachment inquiry by 15 October. \u201cThe committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election,\u201d their joint letter said. \u201cOur inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the President in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the Office of the President.\u201d In response, Giuliani said the chairs have \u201cprejudged\u201d the case, and that the subpoena raises \u201csignificant issues concerning legitimacy\u201d. Meanwhile the New York Times reported that, in another recent phone call, Trump urged Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, to help the attorney general, William Barr, discredit the Russia investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller. The White House restricted access to the call\u2019s transcript to a small group of presidential aides, an unnamed official told the Times, which noted it was \u201can unusual decision that is similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president\u201d. Barr has also held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a justice department investigation that Trump hopes will discredit his own intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election, the Washington Post reported. \u201cBarr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and [John] Durham [the US attorney in Connecticut who is reviewing US intelligence work around the 2016 election] met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter,\u201d the paper said. Giuliani has been operating outside the state department over the past year to push conspiracy theories about Ukraine. He has held meetings with Ukrainian officials in an attempt to push false allegations that the former vice-president Joe Biden compelled Ukraine to fire a prosecutor investigating his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. There is no evidence Joe Biden or his son, Hunter, engaged in corruption in Ukraine. The chairs of the three House committees noted that Giuliani has acknowledged his efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials on national TV. \u201cIn addition to this stark admission, you stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence in the form of text messages, phone records and other communications indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump administration officials may have been involved in this scheme,\u201d wrote the House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, the foreign affairs chairman, Eliot Engel, and the oversight chairman, Elijah Cummings. In his July phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump pressured Ukraine to work with Giuliani and Barr to investigate Biden, a potential challenger to the president in next year\u2019s election, triggering an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint. The Trump administration sought to restrict access to records of his conversation with Zelenskiy by putting them on a system used to hold classified material, the complaint said, adding the call did not contain any information pertinent to national security but was potentially embarrassing. Zelenskiy said on Monday he does not plan to publish his own notes from the call. \u201cThere are certain nuances and things which I think it would be incorrect, even, to publish,\u201d he told journalists at a military site near Kyiv, according to Reuters. He dodged questions of whether Ukraine planned to pursue an investigation at Trump\u2019s request into Biden or his son Hunter. \u201cWe are open, we are ready to investigate [but] it has nothing to do with me. Our independent law enforcement agencies are ready to investigate any case in which the law was broken.\u201d For his part Trump, with false claims and incendiary language, continued to lash out at both Schiff, widely seen as the public face of the impeachment inquiry, and the whistleblower, whose identity remains secret. The president zeroed in on criticism that Schiff received for his opening statement at a hearing last week in which he parodied Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelenskiy. Schiff \u201cillegally made up a FAKE &amp; terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people\u201d, Trump wrote. \u201cIt bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?\u201d The comment echoed Trump\u2019s comment during a 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton that if he was in charge, she would \u201cbe in jail\u201d. In addition, \u201cLock her up!\u201d became a common chant at his rallies. There is no basis for accusing Schiff of treason, which is defined by the constitution as waging war against the US or providing material support to one of its declared enemies, and is punishable by death. Shooting the messenger is a familiar Trump tactic. But this time his words and actions are spelled out in a rough transcript and the whistleblower complaint. As his responses to the threat of impeachment become increasingly wild and wayward, he is receiving unusual criticism from some Republicans and former administration officials. On Sunday, Trump rewrote a quotation from Pastor Robert Jeffress, who told Fox News: \u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d The Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger tweeted: \u201cI have visited nations ravaged by civil war. I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.\u201d Many analysts predict Trump will be impeached by the House. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, confirmed on Monday that the Senate would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to take the matter up. Such is Trump\u2019s grip over the Republican party and conservative media that conventional wisdom holds he would be acquitted by the Senate, maybe even receiving a political boost. But polls show growing public support for impeachment. Speaking at the Brookings Institution in Washington on Monday, senior fellow Jon Hudak noted that Richard Nixon won re-election by a landslide in 1972 and had a job approval rating far higher than Trump\u2019s. Hudak said: \u201cTo think on election day 1972 that Richard Nixon would be impeached and removed from office, which but for his resignation he would have been, to think that would have happened in less than two years, people would have laughed in your face. \u201cBut alas, the evidence was built, the tapes came out and movement happened within the Republican conference and the Senate. Granted, our politics is different now from what it was in 1974, but this idea that there is nothing that can come out that will move a Republican senator towards voting to convict the president I think is foolish.\u201d Lawyers representing the whistleblower, whose identity remains secret, said they have \u201cserious concerns for our client\u2019s personal safety, as well as for others connected to this matter\u201d. Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee have written to its chairman, Lindsey Graham, urging that witnesses be protected from intimidation. \u201cThis committee should not sit idly by as the president threatens potential witnesses, whose testimony may be crucial to congressional investigations into credible allegations against him,\u201d they said in a letter.",

It\u2019s a question that should worry \u2013 and anger \u2013 western politicians and voters as they watch from afar the slow, merciless strangulation of the former British colony\u2019s courageous pro-democracy movement. Once the grand panjandrums of China\u2019s ruling Communist party have completed Tuesdays national day celebrations, additional, potentially fatal twists of their state security garrotte appear inevitable.</p> <p>The malign nature of Beijing\u2019s looming actions may only be intensified by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/30/hong-kong-china-arrests-tension-national-day\" title=\"\">large-scale demonstrations planned</a> in Hong Kong to coincide with the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s 70th anniversary.

This is not because the hundreds of thousands who backed the protests when they began in June have suddenly changed their view on Beijing\u2019s devious efforts to deepen its control.</p> <p>It is certainly not because the protesters have miscalculated or somehow blown their chance of change. In promoting their demands they have, for the most part, shown dignity, eloquence, restraint, persistence and <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2019/08/be-water-seven-tactics-are-winning-hong-kongs-democracy-revolution\" title=\"\">admirable innovation</a>, for example through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/30/hong-kongs-be-water-protests-leaves-china-casting-about-for-an-enemy\" title=\"\">\u201cbe water\u201d</a> pop-up demos, organic ground-up organisation and alternative peer-to-peer social media. These are future paradigms for global protest.</p> <p>But after four months of epic struggle, what do the pro-democracy forces have to show? Official withdrawal of the extradition bill that triggered the upheaval is their sole tangible victory to date. Meanwhile, increased violence involving a minority of protesters is playing into Beijing\u2019s hands, feeding its false narratives about malign agitators, terrorists and foreign agents.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What the west's dereliction implies for other movements opposed to authoritarian regimes is gravely dismaying.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The cause is being lost because, firstly, it was always a grievously unequal battle. China\u2019s rulers, initially taken aback by the scale and intensity of its inhabitants\u2019 alienation, are now moving with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/14/beijing-tactics-crush-hong-kong-protests\" title=\"\">growing determination to suppress it</a>, not address it. They can do so with increased confidence because the turmoil has not prompted significant copycat protests in one-party mainland China, as some initially predicted.</p> <p>Beijing is winning because no discernible internal political challenge has emerged to Xi Jinping, China\u2019s paramount leader \u2013 even though his inflexible and complacent approach has made matters worse. Xi, a strongman leader who casts himself as a latterday Mao with a little red online book of political thoughts to match, is not backing off. He\u2019s doubling down.</p> <p>Beijing is also winning because Hong Kong is no longer quite the vital financial and commercial hub it once was. It was once the primary gateway to China; now the ports of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Ningbo and Guangzhou each handle more container traffic than Hong Kong. Beijing is winning because the painstakingly fabricated \u201cone country, two systems\u201d fudge agreed with Britain in 1997 has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/29/business/hong-kong-china-power.html\" title=\"\">not lasted the course</a>. Nowadays it is seen from Beijing as less of an asset, more a liability \u2013 an artificial arrangement potentially prolonging mainland exposure to Hong Kong\u2019s subversive ideas.</p> <p>At the time of the British handover, there was optimistic talk about how an emerging China\u2019s growing global economic integration would encourage a political transformation and, with it, Beijing\u2019s gradual embrace of western values and international rules-based systems. Such hopes now appear largely misplaced.

      "bodyText": "Who lost Hong Kong? It\u2019s a question that should worry \u2013 and anger \u2013 western politicians and voters as they watch from afar the slow, merciless strangulation of the former British colony\u2019s courageous pro-democracy movement. Once the grand panjandrums of China\u2019s ruling Communist party have completed Tuesdays national day celebrations, additional, potentially fatal twists of their state security garrotte appear inevitable. The malign nature of Beijing\u2019s looming actions may only be intensified by the large-scale demonstrations planned in Hong Kong to coincide with the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s 70th anniversary. Multiple protests and strikes are going ahead despite official bans, pre-emptive arrests, brutal police tactics and media intimidation. But they look destined to end in more damagingly futile violence, similar to that seen at the weekend. If Hong Kong\u2019s battle for democracy \u2013 meaning universal suffrage, direct elections, civil rights, free speech and observance of the rule of law \u2013 has not already been lost, it is teetering on the brink. This is not because the hundreds of thousands who backed the protests when they began in June have suddenly changed their view on Beijing\u2019s devious efforts to deepen its control. It is certainly not because the protesters have miscalculated or somehow blown their chance of change. In promoting their demands they have, for the most part, shown dignity, eloquence, restraint, persistence and admirable innovation, for example through \u201cbe water\u201d pop-up demos, organic ground-up organisation and alternative peer-to-peer social media. These are future paradigms for global protest. But after four months of epic struggle, what do the pro-democracy forces have to show? Official withdrawal of the extradition bill that triggered the upheaval is their sole tangible victory to date. Meanwhile, increased violence involving a minority of protesters is playing into Beijing\u2019s hands, feeding its false narratives about malign agitators, terrorists and foreign agents. The cause is being lost because, firstly, it was always a grievously unequal battle. China\u2019s rulers, initially taken aback by the scale and intensity of its inhabitants\u2019 alienation, are now moving with growing determination to suppress it, not address it. They can do so with increased confidence because the turmoil has not prompted significant copycat protests in one-party mainland China, as some initially predicted. Beijing is winning because no discernible internal political challenge has emerged to Xi Jinping, China\u2019s paramount leader \u2013 even though his inflexible and complacent approach has made matters worse. Xi, a strongman leader who casts himself as a latterday Mao with a little red online book of political thoughts to match, is not backing off. He\u2019s doubling down. Beijing is also winning because Hong Kong is no longer quite the vital financial and commercial hub it once was. It was once the primary gateway to China; now the ports of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Ningbo and Guangzhou each handle more container traffic than Hong Kong. Beijing is winning because the painstakingly fabricated \u201cone country, two systems\u201d fudge agreed with Britain in 1997 has not lasted the course. Nowadays it is seen from Beijing as less of an asset, more a liability \u2013 an artificial arrangement potentially prolonging mainland exposure to Hong Kong\u2019s subversive ideas. At the time of the British handover, there was optimistic talk about how an emerging China\u2019s growing global economic integration would encourage a political transformation and, with it, Beijing\u2019s gradual embrace of western values and international rules-based systems. Such hopes now appear largely misplaced. What Hong Kong shows clearly are the limits to China\u2019s adaptability \u2013 and the Communist party\u2019s undying attachment to political uniformity, not plurality. Under Xi, China\u2019s expansive aim is to change the world to suit its purposes rather than adapt to suit the world. It is both too strong \u2013 in terms of its economic and military might \u2013 and too weak \u2013 in terms of its monolithic politics \u2013 to contemplate a compromise over Hong Kong. On Monday police warned ominously of the \u201cextreme danger [of a] very serious violent attack\u201d on national day, appearing to pre-emptively prepare the way for an even fiercer crackdown. If Hong Kong\u2019s battle is indeed lost, could the pro-democracy movement \u2013 with the odds stacked against it \u2013 have reasonably expected any other outcome? Yes, it could. Such hopes were not wholly delusional. As a legal guarantor of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, Britain has a duty to stand up to China\u2019s repressive behaviour. But aside from a few carefully phrased diplomatic whinges, it has signally failed to do so. Such weak shilly-shallying is contemptuously dismissed in Beijing. The US counts itself a champion of global democratic values, or did so before Donald Trump took office. Congress has made threatening noises but the White House has taken no substantive action. If the US applies punitive measures to China, they concern unfair business practices \u2013 not human rights. In fact, Trump\u2019s ruinous trade war has intensified Beijing\u2019s paranoid sense of a hostile global contest. In such circumstances, any unilateral climbdown, anywhere, is deemed politically unacceptable. Despite waging a trade war, Trump also frequently praises Xi under the mistaken impression that insincere flattery will render him more amenable. Yet the behaviour of other western governments since the Hong Kong crisis blew up has been no less servile. What this spineless dereliction implies for other, similar pro-democracy movements opposed to authoritarian regimes, such as those in Egypt and Russia, or for China\u2019s persecuted Uighur and Hui Muslim minorities, is gravely dismaying.

The invasion proceeded in March, and in July, after no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, Wilson wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/opinion/what-i-didn-t-find-in-africa.html\" title=\"\">What I Didn\u2019t Find in Africa</a>, concluding \u201csome of the intelligence ... was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat\u201d.</p> <p>His language echoed that of Sir Richard Dearlove, head of MI6, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jun/22/iraq.iraq\" title=\"\">2002 Downing Street memo</a>, which did not become public until 2005, who said <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20171123122607/http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/210955/2002-07-23-minute-rycroft-to-manning-iraq-prime-mi-nisters-meeting-23-july.pdf\" title=\"\">\u201cthe intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy\u201d</a> (of military action). The day after the opinion piece appeared, when the White House press secretary Ari Fleischer was asked if the State of the Union assertion was wrong, as Wilson claimed, he replied \u201cthat\u2019s what we\u2019ve acknowledged\u201d, although of course, the administration never had.</p> <p>Reaction to Wilson\u2019s whistleblowing was intense, and he came under heavy fire, accused of political bias or incompetence.

      "bodyText": "Joseph Wilson, who has died aged 69 of organ failure, was the American diplomat whose first-hand questioning of the rationale behind the 2003 invasion of Iraq earned him the enmity of the George W Bush administration, and saw his wife Valerie Plame\u2019s identity as a CIA operative exposed publicly in retaliation. In 2002, with the administration building its case for war with Iraq, the CIA sent Wilson, usually known as \u201cJoe\u201d, to investigate whether the Iraqis had sought to buy yellowcake uranium ore, which might be enriched for use in nuclear weapons, from Niger. He seemed an obvious choice. Not only had his first diplomatic posting been to Niger, but he had also been deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Baghdad during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and the last American to negotiate face to face with Saddam Hussein before that embassy was closed. When Saddam threatened execution for those harbouring foreigners in Baghdad, Wilson, already giving shelter to some 60 civilians, showed up at a press conference with a noose around his neck, saying \u201cif the choice is between allowing American citizens to be taken hostage, or execution, I will bring my own fucking rope\u201d. After eight days in Niger, Wilson concluded there was no evidence that Iraq had acquired uranium, and that even a request by the Iraqis for a meeting with the Niger prime minister to discuss expanding commercial relations had been rebuffed rather than violate UN sanctions against Iraq. He later met Bush at the White House, where the president impressed him by inquiring about his perceptions of Hussein, whom Wilson called \u201ca thug\u201d, and of the Iraqi people. But in his State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush referred to British intelligence that Iraq had \u201crecently sought significant quantities of uranium in Africa\u201d. The invasion proceeded in March, and in July, after no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, Wilson wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times, What I Didn\u2019t Find in Africa, concluding \u201csome of the intelligence ... was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat\u201d. His language echoed that of Sir Richard Dearlove, head of MI6, in the 2002 Downing Street memo, which did not become public until 2005, who said \u201cthe intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy\u201d (of military action). The day after the opinion piece appeared, when the White House press secretary Ari Fleischer was asked if the State of the Union assertion was wrong, as Wilson claimed, he replied \u201cthat\u2019s what we\u2019ve acknowledged\u201d, although of course, the administration never had. Reaction to Wilson\u2019s whistleblowing was intense, and he came under heavy fire, accused of political bias or incompetence. A furious vice-president Dick Cheney asked in a White House meeting whether Wilson\u2019s wife \u201chad sent him on a junket\u201d. Plame was a CIA analyst who worked on nuclear weapons issues, and was involved in investigating the aluminium tubes Iraq had acquired from Jordan, ostensibly for use in creating WMDs. A week after Wilson\u2019s article was published, the rightwing columnist Robert Novak revealed Plame was a CIA agent, an act that can be deemed unlawful in the US. The resulting investigation focused on the presidential adviser Karl Rove and Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, chief of staff to Cheney. Although Novak would eventually reveal his main source was Richard Armitage, a deputy to secretary of state Colin Powell, Libby was convicted of obstructing justice and lying to the FBI. Bush, having promised the leakers would be punished, eventually commuted Libby\u2019s sentence, but to Cheney\u2019s irritation did not pardon him. Libby finally got his pardon from Donald Trump in 2018. A civil suit filed by Wilson and Plame against Cheney, Rove, Libby and Armitage was eventually dismissed in federal courts on the grounds they lacked jurisdiction. But the affair propelled the Wilsons briefly into the celebrity spotlight. Wilson told his story in a 2004 book, Politics of Truth, while Plame published Fair Game in 2007, despite a legal battle with the CIA over its content. The two books formed the basis of Fair Game, a 2010 film starring Sean Penn as Wilson and Naomi Watts as Plame. In his book, Wilson, speaking of the American dead in Iraq, wrote: \u201cThe act of war is the last option of a democracy, taken when there is a grave risk to our national security ... We have a duty to ensure that their sacrifice came for the right reasons.\u201d Wilson was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, but grew up in California, the son of Joseph and Phyllis (nee Finnell).

In the mid 1980s he worked as a congressional fellow, assigned to then senator Al Gore and representative Tom Foley, both Democrats, which would be used against him after he challenged the Bush version of Iraq. Wilson\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce, and in 1986 he married Jacqueline Giorgi, a French diplomat who had served in Africa. After his stint in Baghdad ended with the 1991 Gulf war, he was named ambassador to Gabon and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, and then served as a political adviser to the commander of US forces in Europe.

      "bodyText": "A 13-metre (42ft) statue that draws on the legacies of Queen Victoria, the British empire and the transatlantic slave trade could help trigger a radical reassessment of public monuments in Britain, according to its curator. Kara Walker\u2019s Fons Americanus fountain, which opens to the public on Wednesday 2 October and is the latest Turbine Hall commission at Tate Modern, was inspired by the Queen Victoria memorial outside Buckingham Palace. The Tate Modern curator Clara Kim said the hope was the work would ignite fresh debate of public monuments in Britain. \u201cWe hope that it encourages people to visit the commission itself, and then go back out into the city to look at where these monuments come from and the official accounts of our histories,\u201d she said. Described as a \u201csardonic counterprogram to the celebration of empire\u201d, Walker was inspired by the Queen Victoria memorial after seeing it from her taxi window on the way to Heathrow, after accepting the Tate commission. The huge monument was also inspired by the Trevi fountain in Rome, and contains references to Damien Hirst\u2019s formaldehyde shark, Winslow Homer\u2019s Gulf Stream and JMW Turner\u2019s Slave Ship. At a press conference on Monday, Walker said when she first visited Europe she was shocked by the grand scale of colonial-era monuments. \u201cI think as an American girl coming to Europe for the first time as an art student, I was perversely moved by the grandeur of the palaces,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it really is very jarring when you think about what that\u2019s built on the backs of.\u201d Walker said there was a direct comparison between the Confederate statues in the US, which have polarised opinion and triggered a debate about whether they are inherently racist, and monuments to the British empire such as the Victoria memorial. \u201cIt\u2019s only really recently that there\u2019s been a concerted national conversation about these monuments, about how they got there and what they mean,\u201d she said. The artist, best-known for her 2014 work A Subtlety, the huge sphinx-like figure she housed in an old sugar factory, told the Guardian the Turbine Hall commission was an \u201cirresistible \u2026 grand prize\u201d, and that she had had to educate herself about the history of race and Britain in preparation. Hilton Als, the New Yorker critic and curator of a solo show at Spr\u00fcth Magers that coincides with her Tate commission, said Walker was a \u201csocial critic with heart\u201d whose work has consistently explored America and Britain\u2019s shared and complex racial history. \u201cOne of the things that is powerful about Walker is her work about slavery, and how black people were traded by the British and Portuguese,\u201d said Als. \u201cThe African-American relationship to Britain is a very complicated one and she is again examining it in a powerful way.\u201d Walker said both Kehinde Wiley\u2019s newly installed Times Square monument, Rumors of War, which is 8 metres (26ft) tall and references Confederate statues, and her own Turbine Hall commission formed \u201can interesting moment for monumentality\u201d. \u201cWhat the Confederate debate and removal of statues from places like New Orleans has done is not just reignited the debate, but unearthed the racism and cruelties that have lived fairly quietly under the surface for some time,\u201d she said.

But rather than the raggedy, straw-haired look of old, he has been reimagined with skin as crumpled and weathered as an ancient oak, and creepy roots sprouting from his chin. In short, he is half-man, half-tree \u2013 and 100% sure to scare your children (and maybe you, too). But isn\u2019t children\u2019s TV all about burying nightmarish characters into the psyches of successive generations? Here are some of the scariest.</p> <h2><strong>The Daleks (Doctor Who)</strong></h2> <p>Like body-snatched Question Time audience members, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-who\" title=\"\">Doctor Who</a> baddies often have no hair, wrinkled skin and sunken eyes. The scariest of all remain the Daleks, the metal tanks of doom whose exterminatory antics were supposedly based on the Nazis. Cheery.</p> <h2><strong>Raggety </strong><strong>(Rupert Bear)</strong></h2> <p>Rupert is a cuddly-looking bear dressed as if on a \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firm away day. Then there is Raggety, his moody and terrifying pal, who is shaped like a twig. Time to get some new mates, Rupes.</p> <h2><strong>Grotbags </strong><strong>(Grotbags)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b519f7c8b18b7865ac22f01a2c8f6b4e1b303383\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b519f7c8b18b7865ac22f01a2c8f6b4e1b303383/0_127_4208_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nightmarish ...

You can\u2019t, can you? Perfect, then, for a green-skinned witch with broken teeth, first seen on Rod Hull\u2019s Emu\u2019s World in the 80s. These days, everyone has seen the musical Wicked \u2013 about a green-skinned witch \u2013 at least eight times.</p> <h2><strong>The Demon Headmaster (The Demon Headmaster)</strong></h2> <p>As if being the image of Jack Straw isn\u2019t scary enough, the Demon Headmaster is also, well, a demon headmaster. The series, created for CBBC in 1996, followed his exploits to control a school and then, eventually, seize all the information in the world. Who says teachers are only in it for the holidays?</p> <h2><strong>Mr Blobby </strong><strong>(Noel\u2019s House Party)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f05886a7282dfd9e94b164f6a0bf90e34edebd59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f05886a7282dfd9e94b164f6a0bf90e34edebd59/0_0_654_872/375.jpg\" alt=\"Mr Blobby\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chilling ... Mr Blobby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course Mr Blobby is terrifying \u2013 he is basically a Dalek with legs and a fancy paint job. But it is his lack of personality that makes him so spooky: there is, categorically, nothing inside Mr Blobby\u2019s skull. He is a void of clumsiness, repetition (\u201cBlobby, blobby, blobby\u201d) and nonsense. As the New York Times said, some consider him \u201cproof of Britain\u2019s deep-seated attraction to trash\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Wizbit </strong><strong>(Wizbit)</strong></h2> <p>Everyone remembers Caroline Aherne\u2019s withering question to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/10/debbie-mcgee-paul-daniels-cant-face-doing-magic\" title=\"\">Debbie McGee</a>, in her Mrs Merton guise. But maybe she shouldn\u2019t have been asking what first attracted her to a millionaire, but rather what on earth possessed the pair of them to make a children\u2019s TV show about a sentient wizard\u2019s hat with a monobrow. Chilling.</p> <h2><strong>Chocky (Chocky)</strong></h2> <p>Every child has an imaginary friend, right? But do all kids have imaginary alien friends? Such was the USP of Chocky, the 1984 series about a boy who has his brain infiltrated by an otherworldly creature, attracting the attention of the government. Terrifying \u2013 although nice to remember an era when they had time for things other than stockpiling and backstops.</p> <h2><strong>The Sun baby (Teletubbies)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40d1be957b3cda08c5223237e4582cedc70c2241\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40d1be957b3cda08c5223237e4582cedc70c2241/0_0_1700_1147/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teletubbies' Sun baby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Make it stop ... the Sun baby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Worldwide/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Teletubbies baby is now in her 20s, with an internet rumour earlier this year claiming that she had had a child of her own (it wasn\u2019t true). But, amid the faux-nostalgic \u201cOh my God, I feel so old\u201d, it is easy to forget that the decapitated Teletubbies baby was kind of terrifying, despite being one of the more normal elements of a programme about toddlers with TVs in their stomachs.</p> <h2><strong>Entire cast (Rentaghost)</strong></h2> <p>Creepy jester \u2013 check. Pallid witch \u2013 check. Pantomime horse with a rictus grin \u2013 check. Everything about Rentaghost was scary. At least its vision of west London suburbia avoided the horror of surging house prices and babyccinos.</p> <h2><strong>Noseybonk (Jigsaw)</strong></h2> <p>With his protruding nose, cavernous nostrils and eyes like wormholes, this character from the retro puzzle show looks like something out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/05/a-clockwork-orange-kubrick-review\" title=\"\">A Clockwork Orange</a>. But Noseybonk was, unfortunately, not censored. Even years after the show ended in 1984, he hadn\u2019t gone, popping up on Charlie Brooker\u2019s Screenwipe in 2008.</p>",

Then there is Raggety, his moody and terrifying pal, who is shaped like a twig. Time to get some new mates, Rupes. Grotbags (Grotbags) Try to imagine a more horrible-sounding word than Grotbags. You can\u2019t, can you? Perfect, then, for a green-skinned witch with broken teeth, first seen on Rod Hull\u2019s Emu\u2019s World in the 80s. These days, everyone has seen the musical Wicked \u2013 about a green-skinned witch \u2013 at least eight times. The Demon Headmaster (The Demon Headmaster) As if being the image of Jack Straw isn\u2019t scary enough, the Demon Headmaster is also, well, a demon headmaster. The series, created for CBBC in 1996, followed his exploits to control a school and then, eventually, seize all the information in the world. Who says teachers are only in it for the holidays? Mr Blobby (Noel\u2019s House Party) Of course Mr Blobby is terrifying \u2013 he is basically a Dalek with legs and a fancy paint job. But it is his lack of personality that makes him so spooky: there is, categorically, nothing inside Mr Blobby\u2019s skull. He is a void of clumsiness, repetition (\u201cBlobby, blobby, blobby\u201d) and nonsense. As the New York Times said, some consider him \u201cproof of Britain\u2019s deep-seated attraction to trash\u201d. Wizbit (Wizbit) Everyone remembers Caroline Aherne\u2019s withering question to Debbie McGee, in her Mrs Merton guise. But maybe she shouldn\u2019t have been asking what first attracted her to a millionaire, but rather what on earth possessed the pair of them to make a children\u2019s TV show about a sentient wizard\u2019s hat with a monobrow. Chilling. Chocky (Chocky) Every child has an imaginary friend, right? But do all kids have imaginary alien friends? Such was the USP of Chocky, the 1984 series about a boy who has his brain infiltrated by an otherworldly creature, attracting the attention of the government. Terrifying \u2013 although nice to remember an era when they had time for things other than stockpiling and backstops. The Sun baby (Teletubbies) The Teletubbies baby is now in her 20s, with an internet rumour earlier this year claiming that she had had a child of her own (it wasn\u2019t true). But, amid the faux-nostalgic \u201cOh my God, I feel so old\u201d, it is easy to forget that the decapitated Teletubbies baby was kind of terrifying, despite being one of the more normal elements of a programme about toddlers with TVs in their stomachs. Entire cast (Rentaghost) Creepy jester \u2013 check. Pallid witch \u2013 check. Pantomime horse with a rictus grin \u2013 check. Everything about Rentaghost was scary. At least its vision of west London suburbia avoided the horror of surging house prices and babyccinos. Noseybonk (Jigsaw) With his protruding nose, cavernous nostrils and eyes like wormholes, this character from the retro puzzle show looks like something out of A Clockwork Orange. But Noseybonk was, unfortunately, not censored. Even years after the show ended in 1984, he hadn\u2019t gone, popping up on Charlie Brooker\u2019s Screenwipe in 2008.",

I do hope this may catch on in the UK. I have been thinking for some time that we need a campaign to bring back hitchhiking. Many years ago (before the death of Castro) I had a holiday in Cuba. There was a severe fuel shortage, due to the US blockade. There, we were told, it was an offence not to pick up hitchhikers.

I have been thinking for some time that we need a campaign to bring back hitchhiking. Many years ago (before the death of Castro) I had a holiday in Cuba. There was a severe fuel shortage, due to the US blockade. There, we were told, it was an offence not to pick up hitchhikers.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s September \u2013 the children are back at school, the leaves on the trees are starting to turn from green to inviting shades of auburn, and the need for a pumpkin spiced latte is overwhelming. For many people, their summer holiday is already starting to feel like a distant memory, with their next major trip some way off.</p> <p>But rather than feeling glum as I pack away my summer dresses and pull out my jumpers and boots, I feel a jolt of excitement. Because winter is just around the corner and for me, winter means just one thing \u2013 skiing.</p> <p>Since I learned to ski as a teenager, as soon as the days start getting shorter and the nights start drawing in, I can think of little else but the forthcoming snow. I\u2019ll be reading the long-range weather forecasts, wondering how much snow there will be this year, when would be the best time to go, and which resorts I should head for.</p> <p>If I had the choice, I would always choose a winter day in the mountains over a hot summer\u2019s day on the beach. Nothing beats the gentle bite of the cold air against your face on a crisp morning, bright white snow on the ground, with ice-crystals glistening in the sun against a backdrop of a clear blue sky. Or even on the days when the conditions aren\u2019t so perfect, a hearty, cheese-based lunch or a glass of hot <em>vin chaud</em> after you\u2019ve negotiated your way down some slopes to a cosy mountain restaurant rarely feels so well-deserved.</p> <p>But a snowsports holiday isn\u2019t just about the skiing or snowboarding. It\u2019s also about the mountain views, the resort\u2019s atmosphere, the delight of seeing your child master their first nursery slope, or the precious time spent with family or friends in a spectacular setting. It\u2019s also about fun evenings in apr\u00e8s-ski bars, being out building snowmen or sledging, or perhaps about snowshoeing, relaxing in a spa, trying something new and adventurous such as paragliding, or indeed almost anything you want it to be.</p> <p>Mountain holidays bring people together \u2013 almost anyone can enjoy them. Whether you are a new skier who wants to potter around on the easy slopes, or an expert powder hound who wants to spend most of their time off-piste, as long as you choose your resort carefully, chances are both will be possible. A ski suit-clad toddler can ski with their grandad, teenagers and their parents can spend time together in an activity that they can all enjoy, friends or family can bond over a shared experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72237238a11448bea8eecb490c2bce517fe76c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72237238a11448bea8eecb490c2bce517fe76c91/0_0_1733_1155/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teens Skiing In The AfternoonStocksy txp732b3397dBU200 Medium 1855622\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Mountain holidays bring people together.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gillian Vann/Stocksy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Discovering a new resort is always exciting \u2013 trying out unfamiliar slopes, searching for the best restaurants for a lunch stop, and finding the optimum place for that perfect selfie or the most amazing panoramic mountain view.</p> <p>But your winter holiday is precious, and you don\u2019t want to take all week to discover your favourite pistes, only to realise that you have to go home the next day. And while having a rep show you around the mountain was once offered as standard by most tour operators, rule changes have meant that this service is now rare.</p> <p>However, Neilson Mountain Experts can help you make the most of your holiday. Neilson is now the only ski holiday company to offer free, professional ski guiding throughout the season in selected resorts across France, Austria, Italy and Andorra.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfbdc2496e866631c0e81ef7a590052a56e86bed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfbdc2496e866631c0e81ef7a590052a56e86bed/0_4_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skis on snow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Experts can show you the best slopes to avoid the crowds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirja Geh Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The advantages are obvious \u2013 the experts already know the resort well. They can show you the best slopes to head for to avoid the crowds, the more sheltered or tree-lined slopes that offer better visibility in bad weather, and the sunny bowl you\u2019ll want to play in when skies are blue. They can also give you tips on your technique and posture, as well as introduce you to some of the best mountain restaurants.</p> <p>The two-hour long Mountain Expert sessions are open to anyone over 18 (12 in school holidays) who can already ski confidently on blue or red runs, for each guest in a Mountain Collection hotel or ski chalet and other selected accommodation \u2013 with at least two sessions a week guaranteed. You\u2019ll also get to jump the lift queues when skiing with a Neilson Mountain Expert \u2013 who are all qualified ski and board instructors.</p> <p>So as the sun gets lower in the sky, the heating goes on and you perhaps start thinking about preparations for Christmas, don\u2019t look back at the summer with regret. Look forward to crisp mountain days out in the fresh air, cosy nights in bars with open fires, hearty dishes shared with friends, the delicious nip of crisp alpine air and the satisfied buzz in your muscles of a day spent out in the open, doing what you love. I absolutely cannot wait.</p> <p><em>Enjoy the crisp mountain air this winter in style.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s September \u2013 the children are back at school, the leaves on the trees are starting to turn from green to inviting shades of auburn, and the need for a pumpkin spiced latte is overwhelming. For many people, their summer holiday is already starting to feel like a distant memory, with their next major trip some way off. But rather than feeling glum as I pack away my summer dresses and pull out my jumpers and boots, I feel a jolt of excitement. Because winter is just around the corner and for me, winter means just one thing \u2013 skiing. Since I learned to ski as a teenager, as soon as the days start getting shorter and the nights start drawing in, I can think of little else but the forthcoming snow. I\u2019ll be reading the long-range weather forecasts, wondering how much snow there will be this year, when would be the best time to go, and which resorts I should head for. If I had the choice, I would always choose a winter day in the mountains over a hot summer\u2019s day on the beach. Nothing beats the gentle bite of the cold air against your face on a crisp morning, bright white snow on the ground, with ice-crystals glistening in the sun against a backdrop of a clear blue sky. Or even on the days when the conditions aren\u2019t so perfect, a hearty, cheese-based lunch or a glass of hot vin chaud after you\u2019ve negotiated your way down some slopes to a cosy mountain restaurant rarely feels so well-deserved. But a snowsports holiday isn\u2019t just about the skiing or snowboarding. It\u2019s also about the mountain views, the resort\u2019s atmosphere, the delight of seeing your child master their first nursery slope, or the precious time spent with family or friends in a spectacular setting. It\u2019s also about fun evenings in apr\u00e8s-ski bars, being out building snowmen or sledging, or perhaps about snowshoeing, relaxing in a spa, trying something new and adventurous such as paragliding, or indeed almost anything you want it to be. Mountain holidays bring people together \u2013 almost anyone can enjoy them. Whether you are a new skier who wants to potter around on the easy slopes, or an expert powder hound who wants to spend most of their time off-piste, as long as you choose your resort carefully, chances are both will be possible. A ski suit-clad toddler can ski with their grandad, teenagers and their parents can spend time together in an activity that they can all enjoy, friends or family can bond over a shared experience. Discovering a new resort is always exciting \u2013 trying out unfamiliar slopes, searching for the best restaurants for a lunch stop, and finding the optimum place for that perfect selfie or the most amazing panoramic mountain view. But your winter holiday is precious, and you don\u2019t want to take all week to discover your favourite pistes, only to realise that you have to go home the next day. And while having a rep show you around the mountain was once offered as standard by most tour operators, rule changes have meant that this service is now rare. However, Neilson Mountain Experts can help you make the most of your holiday. Neilson is now the only ski holiday company to offer free, professional ski guiding throughout the season in selected resorts across France, Austria, Italy and Andorra. The advantages are obvious \u2013 the experts already know the resort well. They can show you the best slopes to head for to avoid the crowds, the more sheltered or tree-lined slopes that offer better visibility in bad weather, and the sunny bowl you\u2019ll want to play in when skies are blue. They can also give you tips on your technique and posture, as well as introduce you to some of the best mountain restaurants. The two-hour long Mountain Expert sessions are open to anyone over 18 (12 in school holidays) who can already ski confidently on blue or red runs, for each guest in a Mountain Collection hotel or ski chalet and other selected accommodation \u2013 with at least two sessions a week guaranteed. You\u2019ll also get to jump the lift queues when skiing with a Neilson Mountain Expert \u2013 who are all qualified ski and board instructors. So as the sun gets lower in the sky, the heating goes on and you perhaps start thinking about preparations for Christmas, don\u2019t look back at the summer with regret. Look forward to crisp mountain days out in the fresh air, cosy nights in bars with open fires, hearty dishes shared with friends, the delicious nip of crisp alpine air and the satisfied buzz in your muscles of a day spent out in the open, doing what you love. I absolutely cannot wait. Enjoy the crisp mountain air this winter in style. Join Neilson for top resorts, food, accommodation and free ski guiding and coaching",

If I knew, I would be dating somebody.\u201d</p> <p>The podcast she is referring to is one of the world\u2019s funniest and most vulnerable; for the past two years, she has been sitting down with friends and fellow comedians to discuss her search for love, and theirs, and is soon to hit her hundredth show. As the description of the podcast has it, Byer, who is now 33, has been single for decades, despite being smart, funny and sexually voracious. Her honesty about this makes the podcast feel radical. She is open about her yearning to be loved and her frustration at how difficult it is to find the right man or woman. At a time when dating is arguably more difficult than ever, she offers candour from the trenches.</p> <p>The podcast hasn\u2019t boosted her success at dating, but she doesn\u2019t find this surprising. \u201cI\u2019m not delusional,\u201d she says. \u201cI live in LA, where you have the creme de la creme of bodies to choose from. If you are a shallow person, body type is a thing. Being a black woman is a thing.\u201d In 2014, OkCupid released data showing black women were judged \u201cleast attractive\u201d by users, receiving the lowest number of matches. \u201cI understand I\u2019m not the ideal standard of beauty.

So any date would have to understand that the people who watch my content share my life, too. That\u2019s asking a lot.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if my date was a woman, she\u2019d have to understand that I have a lot of female fans and she wouldn\u2019t be able to get jealous every time a woman talked to me.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that Byer has been single her whole life is baffling; she is beautiful, hilarious, warm and in every other area seems pretty close to taking over the world.

Byer\u2019s parents died when she was young \u2013 her mother when she was 16, and her father when she was 21 \u2013 and therapy has helped her work though those unresolved traumas. \u201cThere\u2019s the saying: what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger. No, it makes you internalise, act out and maybe harm yourself.</p> <p>\u201cI said to my uncle: \u2018I\u2019m on ADD medication.\u2019 He said: \u2018You don\u2019t need that.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m going to see a therapist.\u2019 He said: \u2018Why would you do that?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIn the black community, medication and therapy is stigmatised, but I want to talk about it because my therapist has given me the tools to succeed.

A hot white lady.\u201d</p> <p>I tell Byer there is evidence to suggest that the algorithms some dating apps use further entrench social hierarchies based on factors such as race and body type. The theory goes that as black women are chosen less \u2013 arguably due to white and Eurocentric standards of beauty and femininity \u2013 they are given a lower \u201cscore\u201d for their desirability.

In effect, this keeps everyone \u201cin their place\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Byer screams. \u201cMy day is ruined. I had no idea, but it makes so much sense now that black women have such a hard time on apps. It\u2019s because the algorithm is racist!\u201d</p> <p>On the podcast, her life is her material. Does she ever feel tempted to make things up or construct reality somehow \u2013 has she ever gone on a date with someone who sounded unpromising, for instance, just to have something to talk about? \u201cNo! I want to be in a relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cI will go on a date with a weirdo because maybe they could be my weirdo.

      "body": "<p>\u201cThe tea bag \u2026 is in the process of a large-scale reinvention.\u201d</p> <p>So reads a 2006 New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/dining/13tea.html\">article</a> on the rise of nylon mesh tea bags, an innovation that diversified the tea market and offered a new, fancier echelon of tea bag. \u201cInstead of paper,\u201d the writer explains, \u201cthe leaves will be enveloped by nylon mesh bags in a delicate pyramid shape,\u201d allowing for a larger brewing area and tastier drink, all without the \u201cchore of cleaning up the soggy remains\u201d.</p> <p>Good news, we thought. The innocent tea bag gets an upgrade, while remaining harmless. Not so much. These tea bags actually flood every cup with multitudes of microplastics \u2013 according to a <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.9b02540\">new study</a> released by researchers at McGill University in Montreal last week.</p> <p>Nathalie Tufenkji, a professor of chemical engineering, began studying nylon mesh tea bags after one was served to her at a local cafe.</p> <p>Tufenkji and her team discovered that steeping a single silky plastic tea bag at brewing temperature (95C) releases approximately 11.6bn microplastics and 3.1bn nanoplastics (the latter are 150 times smaller than a hair, possibly small enough to permeate human cells) made up of nylon and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into a single cup of tea.</p> <p>When the researchers in the McGill study experimented with feeding the plastics to microscopic, shrimp-like creatures called water fleas, the fleas wigged the heck out.</p> <p>The water fleas swam \u201ccrazily\u201d, Tufenkji <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/tea-bags-plastic-study-mcgill-1.5295662\">told the CBC</a>. Exposure to the plastics \u201creally stresses them out\u201d. The fleas\u2019 exoskeletons became unnaturally \u201cballooned\u201d, a worrisome effect which the researchers believe warrants further study.</p> <p>To put it unscientifically, the amount of plastic found in these tea bags is more than we ingest from just about anything else. For context, a liter of water in a single-use plastic bottle <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135417309272\">contains</a> 44 microplastic particles; a portion of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749114002425?via%3Dihub\">mussels</a> contains about 90; a kilogram of salt <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.5b03163\">over 600</a>. One study found we consume <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/youre-eating-microplastics-in-ways-you-dont-even-realise-97649\">70,000 particles annually</a> just from the ambient dust that settles on our food.</p> <p>This year, the World Wide Fund for Nature <a href=\"https://wwf.fi/mediabank/12486.pdf\">estimated</a> that the average person ingests about five grams of plastic a week \u2013 the equivalent size of a credit card. Based on that research, over the course of a year we munch through over 260 grams of plastic, which, if you need a visual, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pascall-Wine-Gums-Candy-Gram/dp/B01MAVXAQE\">looks like this bag of candy.</a></p> <p>Yet studies like McGill\u2019s suggest such assessments are probably conservative and we are all consuming much more plastic than we realize. After all, currently only a sliver of common foods, like sugar, shellfish and beer \u2013 representative of just of <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/06/you-eat-thousands-of-bits-of-plastic-every-year/\">15% </a> of the calories consumed by the average person \u2013 have been analyzed for the presence of microplastics.</p> <p>This all sounds pretty bad \u2013 are we destined to incrementally ingest plastic until we become a pile of bones and bottle caps, like those haunting images of dead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/09/seabirds-eat-floating-plastic-debris-because-it-smells-like-food-study-finds-algae-sulfur\">sea birds</a>?

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe tea bag \u2026 is in the process of a large-scale reinvention.\u201d So reads a 2006 New York Times article on the rise of nylon mesh tea bags, an innovation that diversified the tea market and offered a new, fancier echelon of tea bag. \u201cInstead of paper,\u201d the writer explains, \u201cthe leaves will be enveloped by nylon mesh bags in a delicate pyramid shape,\u201d allowing for a larger brewing area and tastier drink, all without the \u201cchore of cleaning up the soggy remains\u201d. Good news, we thought. The innocent tea bag gets an upgrade, while remaining harmless. Not so much. These tea bags actually flood every cup with multitudes of microplastics \u2013 according to a new study released by researchers at McGill University in Montreal last week. Nathalie Tufenkji, a professor of chemical engineering, began studying nylon mesh tea bags after one was served to her at a local cafe. Tufenkji and her team discovered that steeping a single silky plastic tea bag at brewing temperature (95C) releases approximately 11.6bn microplastics and 3.1bn nanoplastics (the latter are 150 times smaller than a hair, possibly small enough to permeate human cells) made up of nylon and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into a single cup of tea. When the researchers in the McGill study experimented with feeding the plastics to microscopic, shrimp-like creatures called water fleas, the fleas wigged the heck out. The water fleas swam \u201ccrazily\u201d, Tufenkji told the CBC. Exposure to the plastics \u201creally stresses them out\u201d. The fleas\u2019 exoskeletons became unnaturally \u201cballooned\u201d, a worrisome effect which the researchers believe warrants further study. To put it unscientifically, the amount of plastic found in these tea bags is more than we ingest from just about anything else. For context, a liter of water in a single-use plastic bottle contains 44 microplastic particles; a portion of mussels contains about 90; a kilogram of salt over 600. One study found we consume 70,000 particles annually just from the ambient dust that settles on our food. This year, the World Wide Fund for Nature estimated that the average person ingests about five grams of plastic a week \u2013 the equivalent size of a credit card. Based on that research, over the course of a year we munch through over 260 grams of plastic, which, if you need a visual, looks like this bag of candy. Yet studies like McGill\u2019s suggest such assessments are probably conservative and we are all consuming much more plastic than we realize. After all, currently only a sliver of common foods, like sugar, shellfish and beer \u2013 representative of just of 15% of the calories consumed by the average person \u2013 have been analyzed for the presence of microplastics. This all sounds pretty bad \u2013 are we destined to incrementally ingest plastic until we become a pile of bones and bottle caps, like those haunting images of dead sea birds? It would be good to know, but the effect of micro- and nanoplastics on human health is relatively unstudied and not currently considered major. \u201cI don\u2019t find it particularly comforting that there\u2019s no hard research that plastics have negative health effects on humans,\u201d says Lindsay Miles, a Perth-based author and blogger who has espoused plastic-free living since 2012. Like DDT, asbestos and cigarettes, \u201cEverything\u2019s safe until someone goes, \u2018Oh no!

Michael Harney of Millerton, New York-based tea company Harney &amp; Sons says his company has been using nylon tea sachets for over 20 years, but over the last six months has been investigating a fully biodegradable alternative. \u201c[We also] offer loose leaf tea, which is a good option,\u201d Harney notes.

      "bodyText": "Steve Bruce cancelled a scheduled training session on Monday as emotions reached boiling point at Newcastle United. But it is understood Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor will be given time to try to put things right at St James\u2019 Park. In the wake of the team\u2019s 5-0 defeat at Leicester \u2013 or \u201csurrender\u201d as Bruce described it on Sunday \u2013 the manager subjected his players to an old school \u201chairdryer\u201d treatment, and later told the media it had been the worst technical area experience of his coaching career. With Newcastle\u2019s squad apparently shocked into silence by that angry dressing room tirade and struggling to cope with the transition in managerial styles between Ben\u00edtez and Bruce, results have been poor this season. The team have taken five points from seven games, winning only once \u2013 albeit at Tottenham \u2013 with further unease fuelled by persistent suggestions of players being confused by Bruce\u2019s tactics. Clear the air talks between team and management are now scheduled for later in the week with the captain, Jamaal Lascelles, expected to assume a prominent role. Although Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner, is believed to be prepared to make a change in order to prevent another relegation, he is reluctant to part company with Bruce so early in the campaign, and particularly after paying Sheffield Wednesday significant compensation in order to recruit him. Moreover Ashley was turned down by several short-listed candidates before appointing Bruce in July and may not find it easy to identify a suitable, and willing, successor. Even so, Bruce had what has been described as a \u201ctense\u201d exchange with Lee Charnley, the managing director, in the wake of the Leicester defeat and could probably do without facing his old club, Manchester United, in front of the television cameras on Tyneside on Sunday. First will come the inquest into events at the King Power Stadium where, by way of exacerbating Bruce\u2019s pain, the midfielder Isaac Hayden was shown a straight red card. Andy Carroll, who came on as a second-half substitute against Leicester, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t play like that again. The gaffer was fuming and rightly so \u2013 it was absolutely terrible.

The image read: \u201cYour MP is working hard \u2026 to make this a human right.\u201d It also featured the address of a website set up against the MP.</p> <p>A number of public figures have come out in support of Creasy, including the TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp. She said of Clear Channel Direct, the agency that was paid for the adverts: \u201cTaking money for ads of that kind aimed at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stellacreasy\">@stellacreasy</a> and women in Walthamstow is appalling. No decent firm should spend money with you.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, tweeted: \u201cDear God this is sick!

      "bodyText": "An advertising agency has apologised for running a campaign against the Labour MP Stella Creasy by an anti-abortion group, which included a billboard featuring a foetus and the words \u201cStop Stella\u201d. The company, Clear Channel, said it would like to \u201csincerely apologise\u201d for any offence caused after the poster appeared in Walthamstow, north-east London. \u201cWe\u2019re taking immediate action to remove this campaign,\u201d a spokesperson said. Creasy, who represents Walthamstow in parliament, is the subject of a targeted movement against her that calls itself \u201cStop Stella\u201d. The protest and campaign was set up by the UK branch of the American anti-abortion organisation the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform. It comes after MPs approved an amendment by Creasy to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK where it remains illegal. The vote was passed by 332 to 99. On Monday, someone covered the advert in her constituency with white paint. Creasy tweeted to say: \u201cI would rather @CCUK_Direct took this advert down, the @metpoliceuk acted to stop the harassment and @patel4witham brought in buffer zone legislation to deal with these people in first place \u2013 but in the meantime [it] seems Walthamstow has my back.\u201d A spokesperson from Clear Channel said: \u201cWe sincerely apologise for any offence that has been caused by a recent campaign which we ran in Walthamstow on behalf of a customer. We\u2019re taking immediate action to remove this campaign.\u201d The agency said it took a neutral stance towards all advertising and had robust procedures in place to ensure that the content it runs complies with UK advertising codes. \u201cWhile this campaign met these requirements, we accept that the content should have been scrutinised in greater detail and should not have been displayed,\u201d the spokesperson said. The company added that they were reviewing the internal processes in place regarding the campaigns and content they run. It comes after protesters entered her constituency on Saturday and put up a poster of her next to a picture of what it claimed was \u201ca 24-week-old aborted baby girl\u201d. The image read: \u201cYour MP is working hard \u2026 to make this a human right.\u201d It also featured the address of a website set up against the MP. A number of public figures have come out in support of Creasy, including the TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp. She said of Clear Channel Direct, the agency that was paid for the adverts: \u201cTaking money for ads of that kind aimed at @stellacreasy and women in Walthamstow is appalling. No decent firm should spend money with you.\u201d Sarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, tweeted: \u201cDear God this is sick! The fact an ad company is making money from this harassment of a pregnant MP is as bad as the campaign group.\u201d The leader of Waltham Forest council, Clare Coghill, said: \u201cI defend anyone\u2019s right to lawfully protest but when it changes into the targeting of individuals in such a personal way, we must come together to say this isn\u2019t acceptable.\u201d She said that the council were looking at all the powers it has at its disposal to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the local MP and the wider public. She added that a complaint had been made to the Advertising Standards Authority around the billboard\u2019s content. The Metropolitan police said they attended the protest on Saturday but there were no offences and no arrests took place. They said they did not receive any complaints about the contents of leaflets or posters at the event. Creasy said she was being targeted because she was pregnant, with people accusing her of being a hypocrite. The website set up by the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform against the MP includes a section that reads: \u201cStella Creasy deliberately conceals in all her public statements and dialogue on abortion \u2026 the humanity of the unborn child and what an abortion procedure actually entails.\u201d It added: \u201cYet when she is speaking about her own baby in her womb, and her previous miscarriages, she speaks openly on their humanity.\u201d Creasy\u2019s amendment argued that abortion laws in Northern Ireland, where women seeking terminations could face life imprisonment, were contrary to international human rights norms. \u201cHow much longer are the women of Northern Ireland expected to wait?\u201d she told MPs. \u201cHow much more are they expected to suffer before we speak up \u2026 as human rights defenders, not human rights deniers?\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThis is a sensitive and complex issue, which is why we conducted an in-depth review of protests outside abortion clinics. \u201cThe right to protest is a vital part of a democratic society, but it is completely unacceptable that anyone should feel harassed or intimidated. \u201cWe expect the police to take a firm stance against protesters who significantly disrupt the lives of others.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap The UK government has refused to launch an inquiry into its links to financial speculators who are accused of shorting UK assets to profit from a disorderly departure from the EU. Treasury minister Simon Clarke has tried to rebut claims, from former chancellor Philip Hammond, that Boris Johnson\u2019s hedge fund backers would win \u201cbillions of pounds\u201d from a no-deal Brexit. But several MPs have warned that Boris Johnson faces a conflict of interest, having taken money from investors -- who have shorted UK companies and could be speculating heavily against the pound. Answering an urgent question on Hammond\u2019s allegations, Clarke claimed that such theories were \u201cmore fit for the tin-foil-hat brigade\u201d. He insisted that the pound should be free to float, and accused critics of \u201cselling this country short\u201d. Claims that investors who backed Johnson, or the Leave Campaign, would win billions from the collapse of sterling were simply wrong, Clarke insisted. And he told several MPs that the best way to avoid a no-deal Brexit was to support efforts to leave with a good deal. But opposition MPs fear that City speculators are hoping to profit from a disorderly Brexit - as the Treasury\u2019s former top civil servant, Nick Macpherson, has warned. Labour\u2019s Tracey Brabin said it was simply immoral for speculators to profit from the pain and disruption that a no-deal Brexit would cause. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said \u201csizeable funds\u201d were being mobilised to profit from no-deal, and criticised the Conservative Party for accepting large donations from hedge funds. McDonnell said there was a clear conflict of interest: The Prime Minister and the Conservative Party have received \u00a3726,000 from individuals who back a no-deal Brexit, many involved in hedge funds, in this year alone.\u201d In response, Clarke accused McDonnell of \u201cthrowing mud around\u201d to \u201csmear\u201d the government, and claimed that a Labour government would be a bigger risk to sterling than Brexit. But Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey also demanded an inquiry, saying: Some of the PM\u2019s biggest donors are clearly betting against Britain, and intentionally or not the prime minister is aiding and abetting them by pursing a no-deal Brexit. Will the government set up an urgent, independent investigation? Clarke refused. Several MPs quoted Philip Hammond\u2019s claim that \u201cJohnson is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit \u2013 and there is only one option that works for them: a crash-out no-deal that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring.\u201d In response, Simon Clarke says that he has great admiration for the former chancellor, but he\u2019s \u201cvery clear that in this case he is wrong\u201d. He also insisted that the government doesn\u2019t have a position on individuals shorting sterling. Earlier, Crispin Odey said it was \u201cabsolute rubbish\u201d to say he was backing a no-deal Brexit to profit from shorting companies. Labour MP Bill Esterson says it\u2019s wrong that hedge funds who have shorted construction and shopping sector companies [such as Odey] would \u201ccash in\u201d from a no-deal Brexit, at the expense of constituents across the country. A weary-sounding Simon Clarke repeats that the government wants to leave the EU with a deal. The only reason there\u2019s a risk of a no-deal is that the opposition are undermining these efforts, he claims. That\u2019s the end of the urgent question on short-selling. Labour MP Mike Amesbury MP asks whether the minister is really saying that Philip Hammond is a member of the \u201ctin foil hat brigade\u201d, by raising concerns over hedge funds. Simon Clarke says that he has great admiration for the former chancellor, but he\u2019s \u201cvery clear that in this case he is wrong\u201d [Reminder: Hammond wrote last weekend that the PM is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit]. Labour MP Kerry McCarthy says the government can\u2019t just sweep away its links to hedge funds, and also calls for an inquiry. We are doing what we\u2019re doing because it\u2019s right to leave the European Union on 31 October, as we promised, Simon Clarke replies. Suggestions to the contrary are not just wrong, they\u2019re offensive. Labour MP Liz McInnes quotes Frances Coppola\u2019s concerns (in the Guardian today) about the conflict of interest created by Boris Johnson\u2019s links to hedge funds. Does the PM have the moral courage to cope with this pressure? Simon Clarke says he does, and also quotes Coppola\u2019s blog in Forbes about the \u2018mythical bets\u2019 on a no-deal Brexit. Labour MP Christian Matheson hits back, saying short-selling doesn\u2019t have a role when the government is deliberately manipulating the currency to deliver a big payout to those who have provided financial backing to individual MPs or the Conservative party. He says there\u2019s a \u201cstink of something that doesn\u2019t seem quite right\u201d. Simon Clarke leaps up, to declare that this is \u201csuch an unworthy question that I won\u2019t dignify it with an answer.\u201d On the issue of nefarious hedge funds, minister Simon Clarke says opposition deputy chief whip in the House of Lords said last year that short selling is not necessarily the evil practice the popular press claim. It has a role. SNP MP Alan Brown also calls for an investigation, pointing out that hedge funds made \u00a3350m overnight by betting against the pound in 2016. There is a clear conflict of interest, so why can\u2019t we have an inquiry? Simon Clarke says MPs should back the government\u2019s efforts to get a goodBrexit deal, rather than risking a no-deal Brexit. Labour MP Matt Western has crunched the numbers, though - he says Odey Asset Management made \u00a3300m shorting sterling in 2016, while the auto industry spent \u00a3350m on protecting themselves from a no-deal Brexit. Q: How large are the short positions against the pound? Simon Clarke refuses to comment, and then accuses MPs of trying to smear the government with \u201cwild speculation\u201d. Labour MP Jack Dromey reminds ministers that chocolate maker Cadbury was taken over a decade ago, because hedge funds built up a 30% stake in the company and wanted a profit. Isn\u2019t there a conflict of interest when you take money from people who profit from selling Britain short? Minister Simon Clarke says the shorting of UK companies is regulated. Ian Austin, Conservative PM, points out that the original claim that hedge funds have taken huge bets against the pound in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit have been debunked twice. Once by the FT (No deal Brexit is not a hedge fund conspiracy) and then by FullFact (We think there\u2019s a big error in that viral article about hedge funds and Brexit). Simon Clarke says it\u2019s \u201cgenuinely\u201d dispiriting that MPs are discussing material that is more suited to the \u201ctin foil hat brigade\u201d than more serious issues at this vital time. The SNP\u2019s David Linden asks the government to publish details of all calls with Crispin Odey (hedge fund magnate and backer of Boris Johnson and Brexit). Clarke says the government won\u2019t comment on meetings with individuals [reminder, Odey told us today that he\u2019s only spoken to Johnson once since he became PM] Labour MP Cat Smith reminds the House that hedge funds also took big bets against the pound in 2016 (and made huge profits when the Leave side won). Is regulation of hedge funds adequate? Clarke says the Treasury keeps this issue under review. Now Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat MP, wades in, pointing to the potential conflict of interest that stems from taking money from hedge funds who are shorting the pound. He says a former Conservative chancellor (Philip Hammond) a former permanent secretary to the treasury (Nick Macpherson) and the prime minister\u2019s own sister (Rachel Johnson, on the radio last week) have \u201cblown the whistle\u201d about Boris Johnson\u2019s links to City speculators. The minister cannot just brush aside these serious claims about a conflict of interest, Davey insists, adding: Some of the PM\u2019s biggest donors are clearly betting against Britain, and intentionally or not the prime minister is aiding and abetting them by pursing a no-deal Brexit. Will the government set up an urgent, independent investigation? Exchequer minister Simon Clarke has a one-word answer - \u201cNo\u201d. SNP MP Hannah Bardell calls for an independent investigation into Boris Johnson\u2019s relationship with speculators, who she calls \u2018short-changers of society\u2019. Minister Simon Clarke doesn\u2019t address this issue, but instead says MPs should respect democracy and deliver Brexit. Q: Isn\u2019t it ironic to see George Soros, who made millions on Black Wednesday, is now backing the \u2018continuity remain\u2019 side? Clarke sticks to his line that the government doesn\u2019t comment on individuals\u2019 actions, The idea that there are only vested interests on one side of this issue can be contested, he adds. Q: What work has the government done on the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the housing market? Clarke says he isn\u2019t aware of any specific work here (which appears to alarm some MPs). Independent Group for Change MP Chris Leslie cites a recent stress test by the Office for Budge Responsibility which predicted an-deal Brexit would sent the pound tumbling, and create a year-long recession. Is this a price worth paying? It\u2019s a good reason to vote for a Brexit deal, Simon Clarke replies. Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay says Simon Clarke is doing \u201csterling work\u201d (a pun which ought to get a yellow card from the Speaker). He invites the minister to talk about Labour\u2019s threat to the economy. Clarke claims that Labour\u2019s \u201ctrillions\u201d of spending promises would crush the economy and cost jobs (which is somewhat ironic, as chancellor Sajid Javid is announcing some hefty spending plans in Manchester any moment). Labour MP Tracy Brabin tells the House of Commons that she watched The Big Short over the weekend (based on Michael Lewis\u2019s excellent investigation into the sub-prime crisis). Isn\u2019t it a question of morality that investors shouldn\u2019t profit from a no-deal Brexit? Clarke says he doesn\u2019t take his economics lessons from Hollywood [which is a shame, as Lewis\u2019s work is excellent, both the film and the book]. Michael Tomlinson, Conservative MP, says the real threat to the UK economy is John McDonnell becoming chancellor. Unsurprisingly, minister Simon Clarke happily supports this view (which the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson then repeats). Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn asks the minister to confirm that the government\u2019s own economic analysis shows that a no-deal Brexit would have the worst impact on growth, jobs and businesses. And why will he contemplate such a scenario? Simon Clarke says the government believes on delivering on the 2016 referendum result. Conservative MP Maria Caulfield says the best way to prevent speculators profiting from a no-deal Brexit is to vote for a withdrawal agreement. Simon Clarke agrees. Labour MP Helen Goodman asks about Crispin Odey\u2019s shorting of housebuilders (Berkeley Group) and shopping centres (INTU) (as I wrote yesterday). Won\u2019t this mean he \u201cmakes a packet\u201d after a no-deal Brexit, when we can\u2019t build homes and shops will close? Minister Simon Clarke refuses to comment on the actions of individuals, and won\u2019t take a position on the issue of short-selling. Former Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable asks if the government is happy for sterling to fall to any level? Clarke says the government doesn\u2019t set a fixed price for sterling - it\u2019s important to allow currencies to move, and he\u2019s certain that the pound can find the appropriate level under any circumstances. Amber Rudd, former home secretary, says that Labour\u2019s economic plans are creating uncertainty and concern in the markets. But the SNP\u2019s Alison Thewliss raises the conflict of issue question, saying Johnson has received hundreds of thousands of pounds from hedge funds. Minister Simon Clarke says the government wants a good deal, and urges MPs to back it. Simon Clarke (who is exchequer secretary to the Treasury) hits back. The only people generating uncertainty in parliament are the opposition, he insists. It is they who are selling this country short. Clarke says the government wants to get a good Brexit deal, and hopes to get a breakthrough at the EU council next month. That is not helped when the opposition remove our negotiating leverage, he claims (a reference to the Benn bill that rules out no deal). He then quotes Frances Coppola\u2019s article in Forbes, describing the short-selling claims as \u201cYet another tin-foil hat conspiracy theory\u201d. We do not accept there is any threat of a conflict of interest, Clarke insists, accusing McDonnell of making a \u201cspeculative attempt\u201d to throw mud around. McDonnell is trying to propagate myth, smear, and stoke tensions in the House of Commons, he claims. John McDonnell is responding now. He says Boris Johnson has created uncertainty in the markets through his Brexit strategy. There is evidence of sizeable funds being mobilised to bet against sterling, in case of a no-deal Brexit, the shadow chancellor warns. McDonnell then quotes Philip Hammond\u2019s claims in The Times that: \u201cJohnson is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit \u2013 and there is only one option that works for them: a crash-out no-deal that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring.\u201d He also cites the support from former Treasury civil servant Nick Macpherson. It\u2019s one thing to have speculators gambling on our countries, but even worse that the Conservative Party has accepted sizeable funds from these speculators, McDonnell declares. And he puts four questions to Simon Clarke. What is the scale of the speculation on Brexit? Is there a conflict of interest, breaching the ministerial code? Isn\u2019t it wrong to take money from people who are speculating on a no-deal Brexit? Will the government support an inquiry into the finance sector, including regulation of hedge funds and short selling? Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is asking his question, on \u2018short positions against the pound\u2019 now. Cabinet minister Simon Clarke is responding. He says the government can\u2019t comment on specific market moves, but it accepts the market-based price of sterling. Investors are entitled to hedge currencies. The UK supports efforts to create a single code to regulate the foreign exchange markets, he said, adding that that UK is leaving the EU on 31st October. Newsflash! Crispin Odey, the hedge fund manager who is a leading backer of a no-deal Brexit and Boris Johnson, has denied that he hopes to profit from a disorderly Brexit. Odey told the Guardian that claims that he supports Brexit because he hopes to make millions from short-selling UK companies and the pound were \u201cabsolute rubbish\u201d. My colleague Nils Pratley reports: Odey said he was optimistic about the prospects for the UK after Brexit, denied influencing strategy at No 10 and said his fund had an overall \u201cneutral\u201d position on UK stocks. The founder of Odey Asset Management said he had spoken to Boris Johnson only once since the latter became Conservative leader, \u201ctwo days after, to say congratulations\u201d. He added: \u201cI am an observer. When it comes to his strategy, I am not involved.\u201d Responding to Hammond\u2019s claims, Odey declared: \u201cIt\u2019s absolute rubbish. It really is. Politics doesn\u2019t drive markets. Markets are very bad at observing political events because they are not monetary. \u201cWe are trading currencies all the time, long and short. Sterling is weak because we have a big current account deficit and an annual budget deficit of 2.5% of GNP [gross national product]. And we have all this noise about whether we are coming out on 31 October and who governs the country \u2013 Boris or parliament.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Financial commentator and author Frances Coppola has dismissed the claim that hedge funds are planning to profit from a hard Brexit as \u201cmythical\u201d. She\u2019s dug into some of Johnson\u2019s hedge fund backers, and concluded that they\u2019re shorting struggling UK companies for a variety of reasons, not just Brexit. Here\u2019s her conclusion: In short, there is no evidence that the hedge funds that have backed Johnson\u2019s election campaign have \u201cmillions of pounds\u201d of speculative bets on no-deal Brexit. They have millions of pounds of speculative bets on U.K. companies, yes, but that is simply business as usual. So this is yet another a tin-foil-hat conspiracy theory. But no doubt it will continue to run. Already, the opposition Labour party has called for an inquiry into Johnson\u2019s \u201cconflict of interest.\u201d She also makes a very important point - -even if there\u2019s nothing untoward, Johnson has a clear conflict of interests, if his financial backers would lose money from (say) a softer Brexit. It is fair to say that financial backing from companies that hope to profit from a no-deal Brexit, even though there is no evidence that they have has yet placed significant bets to that effect, places Johnson under some psychological pressure to deliver what they want even at the expense of the best interests of the country. But if he is any good as a Prime Minister, he will resist this. And if he isn\u2019t, then he shouldn\u2019t be in the job. The full piece is here, and worth a read. There\u2019s no dispute that investors globally have been betting against the pound since the EU referendum. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission keeps a record of net positions for speculative trades on sterling, on the New York and Chicago futures markets. This is a good measure of the situation globally, and shows that pound shorting hit a two-year high in August, as Johnson insisted that Brexit would happen on 31 October, deal or no deal.... Labour have asked chancellor Sajid Javid to respond to the concerns about City speculators shorting the pound. One problem, he\u2019s in Manchester, preparing to give a keynote speech on future tax and spending plans to the Conservative Party conference Hopefully another minister is available... Nick Macpherson, former permanent secretary to the Treasury, backed Philip Hammond yesterday. Macpherson said the former chancellor was right to question the political connections of some of the hedge funds with a financial interest in no deal, warning: \u201cThey are shorting the pound and the country, with the British people the main loser.\u201d I\u2019m sure Labour will want to quote this when their urgent question is heard..... Shorting, in City jargon, can mean borrowing, and selling, shares in a company and hoping to buy them back cheaper in future. It can also mean buying derivative contracts that pay out if the underlying asset declines in value. But, as I tried to explain here last night, it\u2019s a complicated issue. Hedge funds short stocks, and currencies, for lots of reasons. Some may hope to profit from a no-deal Brexit, but others may simply be trying to protect themselves and their clients. Also (and here\u2019s where it gets technical), hedge funds often short one company, and buy shares in another - expecting the latter will outperform. That \u2018long/short\u2019 strategy is popular in the City, as you can profit regardless of wider market moves [as long as the shorted company performed worse than the company you bought shares in] Now this might be interesting. The Labour Party is putting the UK government on the spot about claims that hedge funds who back Boris Johnson have been shorting the pound. Ministers must also take questions on the collapse of busmaker Wrightbus last week, costing over 1,000 jobs. The Labour Whips office has tweeted that two urgent questions have been granted, from 2.30pm UK time. The hedge fund issue exploded over the weekend when Philip Hammond claimed the PM\u2019s supporters in the City will profit from a disorderly Brexit. Writing in The Times, the ex-chancellor said: \u201cJohnson is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit \u2013 and there is only one option that works for them: a crash-out no-deal that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring.\u201d That claim was robustly rejected by business minister Nadhim Zahawi, who called it \u201cuntrue\u201d and an \u201cugly smear\u201d. Hammond hasn\u2019t provided more details, beyond stating that some of Johnson\u2019s City backers have bet on no deal, and will be happy with the lack of progress. Labour have demanded an inquiry. This issue flared up a couple of weeks ago, when Byline Times reported that hedge funds who had backed Johnson, or Vote Leave, had taken out over \u00a38bn in short positions against the pound. This article also claimed that short positions had risen sharply this summer, but this data has been widely denied (I think it only measured the most recent declarations from hedge funds, so inevitably showing a near-term spike, as older contracts would have been settled). The FT did a comprehensive take-down here.... Reuters says that the Saudi authorities won\u2019t be pleased by this downgrade: The downgrade \u2013 which places Saudi Arabia one notch above the assessment of peer rating agency S&amp;P Global \u2013 is a blow to the largest Arab economy just as it is gearing up for a potential international sale of U.S. dollar denominated Islamic bonds. Newsflash: Credit rating agency Fitch has downgraded Saudi Arabia. In a blow to Riyadh, Fitch has lowered its sovereign credit rating by one notch to A, from A+. That\u2019s its sixth highest rating. Fitch is citing the \u201crising geopolitical risk\u201d in the Middle East and the deterioration of the kingdom\u2019s fiscal position (as the oil price is 30% lower than a year ago). Fitch also cites the attack on Saudi Aramco\u2019s oil production facilities earlier this month, \u201cRecent drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure resulted in the temporary suspension of more than half of the country\u2019s oil production. \u201cAlthough oil production was restored fully by end-September, we believe that there is a risk of further attacks on Saudi Arabia, which could result in economic damage.\u201d UK consumer credit growth has slowed to its lowest level in five years, according to new data from the Bank of England. This could be a sign that people are more cautious about their spending, and hunkering down in case the economy The BoE says: The extra amount borrowed by consumers in order to buy goods and services fell to \u00a30.9 billion in August, slightly below the \u00a31.0 billion average since July 2018. Within consumer credit, net credit card borrowing weakened on the month to \u00a30.2 billion, the lowest since December 2018. Net borrowing for other loans and advances remained at \u00a30.7 billion. The annual growth rate of consumer credit continued to slow in August, falling to 5.4%. This remains considerably lower than its peak of 10.9% in November 2016, and is the lowest level since February 2014. The BoE also reports that mortgage approvals dipped a little in August, with net mortgage borrowing by households weakening to \u00a33.9bn in August, from \u00a34.5bn in July. Economist Rupert Seggins has also kindly shown the UK\u2019s place in the global growth league: This is a good spot: 2017, of course, was the year in which Theresa May lost her majority. But it\u2019s tricky to link long-term business investment decisions to general elections. More likely, perhaps, that the shock of the 2016 EU referendum begins to show up a year later, as companies put plans on hold. The ONS has also reported that the UK made a net contribution of \u00a311bn to the European Union last year, as its share of the EU budget. That works out at \u00a3211m per week, contra to what you may have read on the side of a bus..... How does the UK\u2019s performance in 2019 compare to other countries? Well,as this chart shows, the UK was one of the faster-growing G7 companies in January-March, and the fastest-shrinking in April-June. The ONS explains: There has been a slowdown in the euro area in the latest quarter, largely reflecting the contraction in the German economy where GDP fell by 0.1%. Having entered a technical recession in the second half of 2018, the Italian economy continues to perform in a subdued manner as there was no pickup in GDP in Quarter 2. French GDP maintained its quarterly rate of growth of 0.3%. Having increased by 0.8% in Quarter 1, US GDP growth slowed to 0.5% in the latest quarter. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says today\u2019s \u201cGDP Blue Book data\u201d shows an economy propped up by consumer spending, and riddled with weak business investment. UK GDP is still estimated to have fallen by 0.2% in the second quarter after an upwardly revised rise of 0.6% in the first quarter of this year. This volatility largely reflects Brexit timing effects and the underlying trend is still for modest GDP growth at an average of around 0.2% per quarter, or just under 1% per year. Early indicators are that growth continued at a similar modest rate in the third quarter. Household spending has moderated somewhat to an average of around 0.3% per quarter over the past year, but has remained consistently positive, supported by continued jobs growth and increased real earnings. But total investment in the economy has been much more volatile, falling in four of the past six quarters as businesses remain cautious about investing in the face of Brexit-related uncertainty and a slowing global economy. The service sector was the only part of the UK economy to expand in the last quarter, by just 0.1%. Production, construction and agriculture all contracted, according to today\u2019s updated growth report: Worryingly, the ONS has calculated that production output fell by a downwardly revised 1.8% in April-June. That\u2019s the largest decline since the end of 2012. This was driven by a revised 2.8% fall in manufacturing output -- partly due to the car factory stoppages. The ONS says there\u2019s evidence that stockpiling boosted growth in January-March, lifting GDP by a punchy 0.6%. But, those stocks were then run down in the second quarter, when GDP shrank by 0.2%. The ONS also points out that car factories were briefly shuttered in April: Furthermore, it was also reported that a number of car manufacturers had brought forward their annual shutdowns to April as part of Brexit-related contingency planning. Breaking: Britain\u2019s economy has grown a little faster than previously thought over the last year. New GDP figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the economy expanded by 0.6% in January-March, up from 0.5%. A burst of stockpiling ahead of the original Brexit deadline is partly responsible. This lifted the annual growth rate to 1.3%, from 1.2%. However, the UK still contracted by 0.2% in April-June (as that stockpiling boost faded) Anxiety over the US-China trade war is keeping European stock markets subdued today. The main indices are mostly down, a little, after it emerged that American investors could be curbed from investing in China. The White House is also considering blocking Chinese firms from listing on the New York stock exchange, according to insiders. Beijing\u2019s state media has hit back at these reports, criticising the US for trying to decouple from China. The Global Times warned that such a decoupling wouldn\u2019t be easy, and would have \u201csignificant repercussions for the Chinese and US economies, as well as their companies, in the future.\u201d China also pledged to take new steps to support its economy, ahead of a new round of trade negotiations next month. UK businesses are also at risk from a Chinese hard landing. Official data released today showed that China\u2019s factory output continued to contract this month. This manufacturing PMI rose to 49.8, from 49.5 -- the fifth straight month of contraction but closer to the break-even 50 point mark. Service sector companies are still growing, though: Despite UK PLC\u2019s obvious concerns, the government insists that Britain could handle a no-deal Brexit. Chancellor Sajid Javid has been speaking this morning, ahead of his speech at the Conservative Party conference. He told the BBC that leaving the EU without a deal was possible (despite the Benn Bill ruling it out!). Javid said: It\u2019s not our preferred outcome. We are working incredibly hard to get a deal by October 31. But if we do not manage to do that, we do still need to leave the EU on that date - we cannot have any more dither and delay, and we will leave if we have to, without a deal, on October 31. Javid also pledged there would be a \u201csignificant economic policy response\u2019 if there was no deal -- but couldn\u2019t say how much it would cost. The CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s bosses, has also lashed out the government over its handling of Brexit. Over the weekend, it reported that private sector activity had shrunk in the last quarter, and will probably keep shrinking at a faster pace in the next few months. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: \u201cDecision-makers in boardrooms across the country have been watching politics this week with a heavy heart. \u201cDespite all the noise, what must not be forgotten is the importance of getting the UK economy back on track, by supporting investment and innovation which is the bedrock of productivity, and higher living standards. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With just a month until the Brexit deadline, business leaders are growing increasingly pessimistic about the outlook for the UK economy. Economic optimism across British companies has fallen to a three-year low, hitting levels not seen since the 2016 EU referendum. The Lloyds Bank Business Barometer shows that companies\u2019 concerns about the UK leaving the EU have intensified. Around 43% of bosses believe Brexit will have a negative impact, up from 39%. Just 18% believe it will be positive, down from 21%. These charts from the report show how confidence has fallen, as Brexit fears have risen: The survey also found that: Economic optimism fell 5 points to -10%, its lowest since June 2016, while overall business confidence\u00b9 was steady in September, edging up 1 point to 2%. Firms\u2019 assessment of their trading prospects for the year ahead rose by 5 points to 13%, but remained at its second lowest this year. Firms\u2019 concerns about the expected impact of the UK leaving the EU intensified, falling 7 points to a new low of -25. Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says the possibility of a disorderly Brexit is worrying businesses: \u201cWhile overall business confidence this month has remained broadly steady, optimism in the economy has fallen, and both remain significantly below the same period last year, and the historic average. This month we are also seeing firms\u2019 concerns about leaving the EU intensify against the backdrop of ongoing economic uncertainty.\u201d Something for the government to ponder as the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, where the prime minister\u2019s conduct is under scrutiny again. Also coming up today The final reading of UK GDP for the second quarter of 2019 is due this morning. It will give more insight into the UK economy, and probably confirm that it only grew by 1.2% over the last year (including a 0.2% contraction in April-June). New UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit figures are due this morning, and could show whether Brexit uncertainty is deterring people from moving house or hitting the shops. Mortgage lending is expected to dip to \u00a34.2bn, down from \u00a34.61bn in July.

I asked my father \u2013 the school\u2019s art teacher \u2013 who he was. He said: \u201cOh, that\u2019s Jones.\u201d I said: \u201cI want to be him.\u201d We became great friends, and \u201cJones\u201d became better known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-dies-at-the-age-of-69\">David Bowie</a>. David used to tell a story about seeing me on Top of the Pops with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIkcL7b33KU\">the Herd</a> and going: \u201cThat\u2019s Peter! Why isn\u2019t he in school?\u201d</p> <p>I also played guitar in Humble Pie with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/apr/23/artsfeatures2\">Steve Marriott from the Small Faces</a>, but wanted to lead my own band and do some singing. After my first three solo albums flopped, I was convinced the record company were about to drop me.</p> <p>I had three weeks off, so took my guitar to Nassau in the Bahamas to write another album, knowing it was probably make or break. I bumped into Alvin Lee from Ten Years After at the airport and thought: \u201cI won\u2019t get any work done now.\u201d I don\u2019t remember anything about the next two weeks, but after Alvin left I thought: \u201cI\u2019ve got a week left to write the album.\u201d</p> <p>The next day I messed around with my acoustic and in about 20 minutes came up with the chords that became <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvGSwIWuAp0\">Show Me the Way</a>. I had some lunch and a little swim and under a palm tree I then wrote <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVN-2qoquyE\">Baby I Love Your Way</a>. Both songs are about the girlfriend I was about to start living with. With Baby I Love Your Way, the sun was setting, so I wrote: \u201cThe shadows grow so long before my eyes.\u201d The moonlight brought the fireflies out, so they went into the song, too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4x3yFVV-LI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I4x3yFVV-LI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4x3yFVV-LI\">Watch Peter Frampton play Baby I Love Your Way</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When we recorded it, the drummer, John Siomos, said: \u201cThis is one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d But the album [Frampton] flopped. Everything turned around after we recorded a live album in San Francisco, our first big headline show. I was so nervous I forgot that it was being recorded, but to my surprise 8,000 people were going nuts for us. The band were on fire. I really meant what I was singing, and the inspiration of so many people screaming at us meant we really captured something. The live versions of Show Me the Way and Baby I Love Your Way became massive hits, and <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/frampton-comes-alive%21-mw0000372861\">Frampton Comes Alive!</a> was soon the best-selling live album of all time.</p> <h2><strong>Chris Kimsey, engineer, producer</strong></h2> <p>We recorded the studio version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPXOGemTV4Q\">Baby I Love Your Way</a> in a castle in Gloucestershire, using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jan/30/ronnie-lane-great-underappreciated-british-songwriter\">Ronnie La</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jan/30/ronnie-lane-great-underappreciated-british-songwriter\">ne</a>\u2019s mobile studio. The idea was to get away from London and the label, not that they interfered much. It was more a manor with a few turrets than a full-on medieval castle, so not too goth, but dank and miserable. There were balls and chains and armour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1SJZWjxsSbKvSycxDfnwcN\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1SJZWjxsSbKvSycxDfnwcN\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Quite often when anyone\u2019s under pressure in music, you find that something special happens very quickly. Peter was listening to a lot of Stevie Wonder and was impressed that Stevie played every instrument on his records, so Peter did that, too \u2013 everything except the drums, and he\u2019s a really good drummer!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gjWcnJLIZ0\">The live version</a> is more stripped down, faster, with more electric guitar. Peter sings his heart out. He wasn\u2019t really noted as a singer so he wanted to make his mark, and he succeeded. The energy of the live album feels as if there\u2019s sunshine on it \u2013 Big Mountain kept that feel for their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIgq9spZnhk\">reggae cover version</a> \u2013 whereas on our initial album version it was probably pissing it down with rain.</p> <p>People always ask me whether the live album was overdubbed. It was all live apart from a keyboard part we had to fix because a lead came out on stage. Frampton Comes Alive! was never intended to be a double album. Peter\u2019s manager went: \u201cNobody will want to listen to the whole gig.\u201d But, when A&amp;M Records owner Jerry Moss came down to listen, he said: \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of it?\u201d So we had to go back in and mix the rest. After the live album came out, Peter couldn\u2019t go out on his own because he\u2019d get mobbed. In New York, girls would be jumping on him \u2013 not just a few but loads of them \u2013 trying to rip his clothes off. It was insane.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://peterframpton.com/\">Peter Frampton\u2019s new album, All Blues</a>, is out now.

Why isn\u2019t he in school?\u201d I also played guitar in Humble Pie with Steve Marriott from the Small Faces, but wanted to lead my own band and do some singing. After my first three solo albums flopped, I was convinced the record company were about to drop me. I had three weeks off, so took my guitar to Nassau in the Bahamas to write another album, knowing it was probably make or break. I bumped into Alvin Lee from Ten Years After at the airport and thought: \u201cI won\u2019t get any work done now.\u201d I don\u2019t remember anything about the next two weeks, but after Alvin left I thought: \u201cI\u2019ve got a week left to write the album.\u201d The next day I messed around with my acoustic and in about 20 minutes came up with the chords that became Show Me the Way. I had some lunch and a little swim and under a palm tree I then wrote Baby I Love Your Way. Both songs are about the girlfriend I was about to start living with. With Baby I Love Your Way, the sun was setting, so I wrote: \u201cThe shadows grow so long before my eyes.\u201d The moonlight brought the fireflies out, so they went into the song, too. When we recorded it, the drummer, John Siomos, said: \u201cThis is one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d But the album [Frampton] flopped. Everything turned around after we recorded a live album in San Francisco, our first big headline show. I was so nervous I forgot that it was being recorded, but to my surprise 8,000 people were going nuts for us. The band were on fire. I really meant what I was singing, and the inspiration of so many people screaming at us meant we really captured something. The live versions of Show Me the Way and Baby I Love Your Way became massive hits, and Frampton Comes Alive! was soon the best-selling live album of all time. Chris Kimsey, engineer, producer We recorded the studio version of Baby I Love Your Way in a castle in Gloucestershire, using Ronnie Lane\u2019s mobile studio. The idea was to get away from London and the label, not that they interfered much. It was more a manor with a few turrets than a full-on medieval castle, so not too goth, but dank and miserable. There were balls and chains and armour. Quite often when anyone\u2019s under pressure in music, you find that something special happens very quickly. Peter was listening to a lot of Stevie Wonder and was impressed that Stevie played every instrument on his records, so Peter did that, too \u2013 everything except the drums, and he\u2019s a really good drummer! The live version is more stripped down, faster, with more electric guitar. Peter sings his heart out. He wasn\u2019t really noted as a singer so he wanted to make his mark, and he succeeded. The energy of the live album feels as if there\u2019s sunshine on it \u2013 Big Mountain kept that feel for their reggae cover version \u2013 whereas on our initial album version it was probably pissing it down with rain. People always ask me whether the live album was overdubbed. It was all live apart from a keyboard part we had to fix because a lead came out on stage. Frampton Comes Alive! was never intended to be a double album. Peter\u2019s manager went: \u201cNobody will want to listen to the whole gig.\u201d But, when A&amp;M Records owner Jerry Moss came down to listen, he said: \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of it?\u201d So we had to go back in and mix the rest. After the live album came out, Peter couldn\u2019t go out on his own because he\u2019d get mobbed. In New York, girls would be jumping on him \u2013 not just a few but loads of them \u2013 trying to rip his clothes off. It was insane. \u2022 Peter Frampton\u2019s new album, All Blues, is out now. His farewell tour of the US ends on 12 October.",

      "bodyText": "Kurdish artworks that survived Saddam Hussein\u2019s use of chemical weapons as well as Islamic State\u2019s cultural vandalism will go on display at a London gallery this week. Iraqi Kurdish artists have made paintings and art installations from artefacts including Assyrian reliefs from 700 BC peppered by Isis bullet holes and the farewell \u201cdeath\u201d notes of a charity worker smuggling aid to Isis-controlled Mosul. The exhibition is part of a series of events marking the 10th anniversary of Gulan, a UK-registered charity promoting Kurdish culture. Hemn Hamid is one of the Iraqi Kurdish artists whose work will be on display at the P21 Gallery in King\u2019s Cross for the Road through Kurdistan exhibition. He risked his life for almost four years by not only smuggling medicines and food into Mosul but also chronicling life under Isis\u2019s oppressive rule through his art. Before setting out every morning, the aid worker and artist would pen a farewell note to his wife and children in case he was killed by Isis fighters. Richard Wilding, who curated the exhibition along with the Kurdish artist Mariwan Jalal, described Hamid\u2019s installation as \u201ca remarkable artistic portrayal of saying goodbye to your loved ones every single day\u201d. Wilding continued: \u201cIn the notes he says that, \u2018If I don\u2019t come back, if you never see me again, I want you to know that I love you and how much I think of you.\u2019 This is extremely powerful stuff and all of it will be accompanied by full translations. \u201cHe displayed the same humanity with the boys he met who were carving toy guns out of woodbecause that is what they were seeing every day on their streets when the Isis fighters appeared\u201d Photographs of ancient books rescued by Father Najeeb Michaeel , will also be shown. An hour and a half before Isis militants arrived to attack a Christian town outside Mosul, Michaeel packed his car with the books and transported them to the safety of the Iraqi Kurdish region. When Isis later arrived at the Christian redoubt they burned down the church and charcoal from its charred remains was later used by the London artist Piers Secunda to draw pictures of Assyrian reliefs that were vandalised when Isis controlled the era from 2014. Among the 18 artists represented at the exhibition, which begins on Wednesday, is Rebwar Saed, a former Kurdish Peshmerga fighter turned international artist. Saed\u2019s writings and drawings meticulously record the aftermath of the horrors of chemical warfare during Saddam Hussein\u2019s Anfal genocide in which tens of thousands of Kurds were killed. In one diary entry, Saed details chemical weapons being dropped from the sky: \u201cWe could hear screaming. The bunker, which was half-ruined, started shaking. Everyone wanted to take shelter inside. I started smelling chemical gas and everyone started to run outside. I put on my mask that I carried with me and started to run towards the higher hills. I didn\u2019t stop until I got to the top.\u201d Road through Kurdistan at P21 Galley on Chalton Street, London runs until 26 October 2019.",

But with parliament passing legislation to try to force him to seek an extension, and opposition MPs refusing him an election until that extension is secured, senior Conservatives are starting to contemplate a world in which Brexit isn\u2019t done at the end of October.</p> <p>And so talk at conference has turned to how the party could wear an extension in a general election \u2013 and who could be made to carry the blame.</p> <p>Some had hoped that this predicament wouldn\u2019t arise because there would be a deal with the European Union. However, ministers and MPs now see agreeing a deal with the EU in the next week as unlikely. \u201cI give it a one in three chance,\u201d says a government minister keen for a Brexit deal. Even Johnson, normally the biggest optimist in the room, is viewed to be relatively downbeat about the chances by members of his cabinet \u2013 with the prime minister playing down the chances of a deal during a cabinet conference call last week. </p> <p>Not all Tory MPs want a deal right now, though. A number of Conservative MPs who represent Brexit-backing seats that they won from Labour in 2017 worry that an attempt to pass a Brexit deal in the next few weeks could backfire on them at the ballot box. Tory MPs believe that recent rhetoric from No 10 about the Benn bill being the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/pms-divisive-surrender-bill-phrase-neither-careless-nor-casual\" title=\"\">surrender bill</a>\u201d has cut through with leave voters and the threat of the Brexit party appears to be decreasing as voters increasingly identify Johnson as the champion of leave.</p> <p>Why risk that with a Brexit compromise? If Johnson won a time limit on the backstop, it would be a tough sell to get it through parliament. Recent incidents in the chamber \u2013 namely Johnson replying \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/surrender-humbug-most-heated-exchanges-in-commons-debate\" title=\"\">humbug</a>\u201d to Paula Sherriff\u2019s call for calmer language out of respect to the memory of Jo Cox \u2013 mean that there\u2019s little goodwill between the Tories and Labour MPs, who will find it hard to help Johnson out, even if they wanted Brexit done for their own constituents.</p> <p>The Tory worry is that Johnson will go all out to sell a small change to the withdrawal agreement as a big win and then fail to get it through parliament. \u201cWe\u2019d go into the election with Nigel Farage able to say we were no better than Theresa May and her withdrawal agreement,\u201d one MP in a leave seat says. \u201cHe could cry Brexit betrayal.\u201d Meanwhile with Brexit \u201cdone\u201d, Labour leavers would have little reason to vote for the Tories. If Brexit had already happened, there would be no need to vote Tory to make it happen.</p> <p>Many MPs hope Johnson\u2019s manoeuvring will be enough to simply ensure the UK leaves on the 31 October \u2013 deal or no deal. At that point, MPs would likely bring the government down and an election would follow in which Johnson had made good on his promise.</p> <p>Despite this prevailing mood, some senior government figures urge caution. While a handful of No 10 aides \u2013 headed by Dominic Cummings \u2013 have suggested they have a way around the bill, which would means Johnson would be able to refuse to request an article 50 extension and not be in breach of the law. The apparent loophole is reportedly known only to Johnson\u2019s inner circle. However, few believe that it is a 100% reliable route. Instead, it\u2019s about the narrative and the fight.</p> <p>Cummings has told colleagues that he expects the last two weeks of October to be spent in the courts. Whatever trick Johnson\u2019s senior aides have up their sleeve, expect it to be contested \u2013 and Johnson to potentially be defeated in court again.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about showing that we have done everything possible to try to meet that deadline,\u201d says one government aide. \u201cHopefully it will work but if it doesn\u2019t the public will know it was the Tories who were the ones trying to make it happen.\u201d</p> <p>Were the courts to legally force Johnson to request an extension, he would be faced with a choice: request or resign. Within No 10 there is mixed opinion on the pros and cons of resigning \u2013 Johnson is personally against the idea. What they agree on is that however they play it, any extension will not be their fault.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/30/brexit-apocalyptic-radical-new-ideas-progressive-thinking\">Brexit may feel apocalyptic \u2013 but radical new ideas are taking root | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If it\u2019s ordered by the courts, blame could be pointed at judges rather than ministers. One source of encouragement is recent focus groups where attendees spoke about the courts getting involved with politics. Attendees saw judges as part of a more general theme of everyone trying to stop Brexit \u2013 and identified Johnson as the person trying to deliver it.</p> <p>Another source of hope has been found in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1176775484581011456\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage tweet</a>. When the supreme court ruling came through and found Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament unlawful, Farage took to social media to call on Johnson to resign \u201cas a matter of honour\u201d. The bulk of replies from Brexit supporters said that they usually agreed with Farage but on this he was wrong \u2013 Johnson ought not to resign as it would play into the hands of remainers. This is taken as a sign that Johnson\u2019s positioning as the ultimate Brexiteer is landing.</p> <p>An election after an extension has been agreed would no doubt be difficult for the Tories. It would risk disillusioned Brexit voters moving to Farage\u2019s party \u2013 and leave voters concluding that Johnson was ineffective.

Some had hoped that this predicament wouldn\u2019t arise because there would be a deal with the European Union. However, ministers and MPs now see agreeing a deal with the EU in the next week as unlikely. \u201cI give it a one in three chance,\u201d says a government minister keen for a Brexit deal. Even Johnson, normally the biggest optimist in the room, is viewed to be relatively downbeat about the chances by members of his cabinet \u2013 with the prime minister playing down the chances of a deal during a cabinet conference call last week. Not all Tory MPs want a deal right now, though. A number of Conservative MPs who represent Brexit-backing seats that they won from Labour in 2017 worry that an attempt to pass a Brexit deal in the next few weeks could backfire on them at the ballot box. Tory MPs believe that recent rhetoric from No 10 about the Benn bill being the \u201csurrender bill\u201d has cut through with leave voters and the threat of the Brexit party appears to be decreasing as voters increasingly identify Johnson as the champion of leave. Why risk that with a Brexit compromise? If Johnson won a time limit on the backstop, it would be a tough sell to get it through parliament. Recent incidents in the chamber \u2013 namely Johnson replying \u201chumbug\u201d to Paula Sherriff\u2019s call for calmer language out of respect to the memory of Jo Cox \u2013 mean that there\u2019s little goodwill between the Tories and Labour MPs, who will find it hard to help Johnson out, even if they wanted Brexit done for their own constituents. The Tory worry is that Johnson will go all out to sell a small change to the withdrawal agreement as a big win and then fail to get it through parliament. \u201cWe\u2019d go into the election with Nigel Farage able to say we were no better than Theresa May and her withdrawal agreement,\u201d one MP in a leave seat says. \u201cHe could cry Brexit betrayal.\u201d Meanwhile with Brexit \u201cdone\u201d, Labour leavers would have little reason to vote for the Tories. If Brexit had already happened, there would be no need to vote Tory to make it happen. Many MPs hope Johnson\u2019s manoeuvring will be enough to simply ensure the UK leaves on the 31 October \u2013 deal or no deal. At that point, MPs would likely bring the government down and an election would follow in which Johnson had made good on his promise. Despite this prevailing mood, some senior government figures urge caution. While a handful of No 10 aides \u2013 headed by Dominic Cummings \u2013 have suggested they have a way around the bill, which would means Johnson would be able to refuse to request an article 50 extension and not be in breach of the law. The apparent loophole is reportedly known only to Johnson\u2019s inner circle. However, few believe that it is a 100% reliable route. Instead, it\u2019s about the narrative and the fight. Cummings has told colleagues that he expects the last two weeks of October to be spent in the courts. Whatever trick Johnson\u2019s senior aides have up their sleeve, expect it to be contested \u2013 and Johnson to potentially be defeated in court again. \u201cIt\u2019s about showing that we have done everything possible to try to meet that deadline,\u201d says one government aide. \u201cHopefully it will work but if it doesn\u2019t the public will know it was the Tories who were the ones trying to make it happen.\u201d Were the courts to legally force Johnson to request an extension, he would be faced with a choice: request or resign. Within No 10 there is mixed opinion on the pros and cons of resigning \u2013 Johnson is personally against the idea. What they agree on is that however they play it, any extension will not be their fault. If it\u2019s ordered by the courts, blame could be pointed at judges rather than ministers. One source of encouragement is recent focus groups where attendees spoke about the courts getting involved with politics. Attendees saw judges as part of a more general theme of everyone trying to stop Brexit \u2013 and identified Johnson as the person trying to deliver it. Another source of hope has been found in a Nigel Farage tweet. When the supreme court ruling came through and found Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament unlawful, Farage took to social media to call on Johnson to resign \u201cas a matter of honour\u201d. The bulk of replies from Brexit supporters said that they usually agreed with Farage but on this he was wrong \u2013 Johnson ought not to resign as it would play into the hands of remainers. This is taken as a sign that Johnson\u2019s positioning as the ultimate Brexiteer is landing. An election after an extension has been agreed would no doubt be difficult for the Tories. It would risk disillusioned Brexit voters moving to Farage\u2019s party \u2013 and leave voters concluding that Johnson was ineffective. But increasingly, Tories believe that if push comes to shove, they could wear it if they had to. \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor \u2022 Guardian Live: Brexit, How Likely is a No-Deal Exit?

      "bodyText": "SOME LIGHT RELIEF Anyone looking for sporting distraction in Manchester on Monday evening will have no shortage of options to choose from. With the Tory party conference in town, Boris Johnson and his coterie of fawning frontbench lickspittles have been sweating profusely as they stretch every sinew in their efforts to dodge questions posed by reporters eager to find out if he performed a passable impersonation of Mr Tickle at a boozy lunch two decades ago. \u201cNo and I think what the public want to hear is about what we are doing to level up and unite the country,\u201d said the prime minister, showing his finger is as far removed from the public pulse as he insists it was from a young journalist\u2019s thigh all those years ago. For those whose appetite for gladiatorial combat isn\u2019t sated by smirking, self-satisfied, intellectually challenged flunkies such as Mark Francois, Liz Truss, Esther McVey, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid going toe-to-toe with the truth, the most basic common sense, assorted hecklers and various members of the fourth estate, a presumably more edifying but possibly less politically charged contest will be taking place at Old Trafford later this evening. Yes, Manchester United will be entertaining Arsenal in a match likely to be lacking the traditional needle, viciousness and airborne carbohydrate-rich contests of past meetings \u2013 but it could be entertainingly bonkers nonetheless. United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r enjoyed some rare good news, when Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford were passed fit for the game despite fears the duo would miss out. The availability of the former will also come as a boost to Sky Sports, who have presumably gone to great expense to get Roy Keane on Monday Night Football and will be hoping a below-par performance from the ring-rusty Pogster will get that vein on the Irishman\u2019s forehead throbbing. Unai Emery is unlikely to start H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn for the first time in nine months, despite the Spanish full-back\u2019s brief cameo against Keane\u2019s former side Nottingham Forest last week. Having played 77 minutes against Forest, Kieran Tierney looks likely to make his league debut for the Gunners since his medium-money summer move from the Queen\u2019s Celtic. Arsenal fans will be eager to see if the young star is able to hack it against the Premier League\u2019s finest and will be hoping he stays fit between now and 14 December when he will get the opportunity to do so against the reigning champions, Manchester City.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThis past year was filled with so many ups and downs but I made a promise to myself that I would come back. No matter how hard that would be. It\u2019s been a long road but I did it. Three months and one day after I gave birth to my baby girl\u201d \u2013 tip of the hat to Orlando Pride\u2019s Sydney Leroux for returning to action after the birth of her second child quicker than The Fiver can come up with a mildly funny joke. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Max Rushden and the pod squad will be here soon with Football Weekly. FIVER LETTERS \u201cIn Friday\u2019s Fiver you refer to one Saud Abdul Ghani as Dr. Cool. Whatever discipline his doctorate is in, it is not one that endowed a firm grasp of thermodynamics. Without delving into the mathematics and physics of the first and second laws, let\u2019s just observe that it\u2019s easier to stay warm than it is to stay cool. Dr. Cool\u2019s scheme while not adding to the gaiety of nations will most certainly add to their heat. In the belief that Morris Dancing Uncle Fiver appreciates the Victorian era, and therefore the mechanical devices that gave birth to the laws of thermodynamics, we finish with the observation that science owes more to the steam engine than the steam engine owes to science\u201d \u2013 Adrian Tuck. \u201cIn response to Paul Buller\u2019s wondering at younger readers\u2019 reactions: alienation is far too complex an emotion to expect from tired references to stuff that was popular in the 90s. Apathy, sure\u201d \u2013 Sam Cutting (32). \u201cI\u2019m a tad over 31, and, rather like that James Milner stat, I think I\u2019ve been a reader longer than I haven\u2019t. Or at least it feels that way. Here\u2019s to the prematurely ageing\u201d \u2013 Craig Fawcett. \u201cI would like to submit my application for the position of \u2018youngest reader\u2019 at the age of 29. Fortunately, Google has granted me the ability to look up and thus understand the reference to Jimmy Corkhill.

He has insisted in texts to journalists he resigned from the Trump administration, because of multiple disagreements about policy. Trump has claimed he fired Bolton, and has sought to portray him as a warmonger who helped take the US into the Iraq conflict. Bolton\u2019s position outside the administration will be a worry for those left inside, and not just because of testimony he might provide in impeachment proceedings. He is assertively undermining Trump\u2019s proudest foreign policy achievement, that the president had hoped to reinforce with a fourth summit, during the 2020 election campaign.",

Speaking with journalists on Monday, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said that the release of summaries or transcripts of the two leaders\u2019 discussions \u2013 details of which have remained a closely guarded secret \u2013 is \u201conly possible with the mutual agreement of both sides\u201d. \u201cDiplomatic practice does not allow for the publication [of these records],\u201d Peskov said, according to the Interfax news service. \u201cSo if the Americans send us signals, then we\u2019ll discuss it.\u201d Trump and Putin have held at least 11 phone calls since Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to the Kremlin website, and also have met several times in person with only a translator present. Trump\u2019s affinity for Putin and his rejection of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections have brought additional scrutiny to those conversations. The White House has released little or no information about some of the conversations. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee who is leading the impeachment inquiry, said in a television appearance this weekend that he would seek access to Trump\u2019s conversations with Putin as part of a growing investigation into his alleged abuse of presidential powers to aid his re-election campaign. \u201cI think the paramount need here is to protect the national security of the United States and see whether in the conversations with other world leaders \u2013 and in particular with Putin \u2013 that the president was also undermining our security in a way that he thought would personally benefit his campaign,\u201d Schiff said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. It is not clear how the Kremlin could stop Trump from complying if the documents are subpoenaed by Congress, although the White House could claim the documents are protected by executive privilege. Peskov\u2019s remarks can also be seen as trolling, creating the perception that Trump is compromised by his relationship with the Kremlin in a show of contempt for current US political attitudes toward Russia. Democrats have launched the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, into investigating his political rival Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. According to records of a telephone call and a whistleblower complaint by a member of the intelligence community, Trump blocked military aid to Ukraine before repeatedly telling Zelenskiy on a 25 July call to speak with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani about investigating Biden\u2019s son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine. According to the whistleblower complaint, the Trump administration sought to restrict access to records of his conversation with Zelenskiy by putting them on a system used to hold highly sensitive and classified material. The call did not contain any information pertinent to national security, the whistleblower complaint said, but was potentially embarrassing for Trump. White House officials also sought to limit access to Trump\u2019s conversations with Putin, CNN reported on Friday, refusing to circulate transcripts of at least one telephone call among senior staff.

In the meantime, there were 22 more shots, three more goals, and nothing more they could give: \u201cLovely for fans, but not a goalie\u2019s favourite game,\u201d Real Sociedad goalkeeper Miguel \u00c1ngel Moy\u00e1 said, standing there smiling despite being defeated, aware that he\u2019d been part of something special. On the weekend when the centre of Spain became the centre of Spanish football, Barcelona travelling to Getafe and Real Madrid going to the Metropolitano to face Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, if they wanted a game that was genuinely good, they had to wait 24 hours and look south.</p> \n<p>Good? Sevilla v Real Sociedad, which finished 3-2, was <em>brilliant</em>, the match of the season so far and everything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/atletico-madrid-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report\">the Madrid derby</a> hadn\u2019t been: fast, open, fun, full of great touches, four brilliant and a determination to win whatever the costs, a willingness to risk everything. \u201cWe wanted a match that was back and forth, but knew Sevilla would probably want that too,\u201d Moy\u00e1 said, and nor was it just that they went from one end to the other; it was <em>how</em> they did it, the pace, noise and nerves not diminishing the play. Instead it was enhanced, the ability breathtaking at times.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/30/wagner-schalke-surprise-leipzig-rabbi-matondo\">Wagner makes Schalke believe again after springing a surprise at Leipzig | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Joan Jord\u00e1n smashed an absurd shot that no one saw coming. Or going, for that matter. Sergio Reguil\u00f3n scooped a pass so good it was silly. Jules Kound\u00e9 took off to connect with a flying volley. Lucas Ocampos, unstoppable every time he ran, thundered a shot in at the near post. And \u00d8degaard, who has made more opportunities than anyone else this season, smoothly presented Willian Jos\u00e9 with yet another open invitation. And those were some of the ones that didn\u2019t go in: Jord\u00e1n\u2019s shot flew back off the post, Reguil\u00f3n\u2019s fantasy didn\u2019t get the finish, Moya saved from Ocampos and watched Kound\u00e9\u2019s overhead kick fade a fraction wide, and Willian Jos\u00e9 sliced the best opportunity past the post, leaving Sevilla goalkeeper Tom\u00e1s Vaclik blowing out his cheeks.</p> \n<p>Which was pretty much how everyone felt at the end of this. Julen Lopetegui, especially. Sevilla\u2019s manager might have thought it was happening again, standing there on the touchline watching an uncomfortably familiar story unfold. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/oct/22/real-madrid-%20julen-lopetegui-and-the-actions-of-a-condemned-man-football-la-liga\">brief time as manager of Real Madrid</a>, it\u2019s often forgotten, had begun well, the run reading win, win, win, draw, win, his team joint top of the table, until the night they went to Sevilla in week six, when it all fell apart. Defeated at the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n, they drew the next match with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, then went to the Basque Country and lost to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/oct/08/alaves-%20beautiful-madness-real-madrid-pressure-julen-lopetegui-la-liga-football\">95th minute goal at Alav\u00e9s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/oct/22/real-%20madrid-julen-lopetegui-and-the-actions-of-a-condemned-man-football-la-liga\">lost to Levante</a>, everything unravelling, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/28/barcelona-real-%20madrid-la-liga-match-report\">got beaten at Barcelona</a>.

Now, three days later, they were a goal down after just four minutes \u2013 and against his team too.</p> \n<p>The son of a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-%20division/15/blog/post/3882913/after-real-madrid-failurelopetegui--is-on-a-mission-with-sevilla\">champion stone-lifter from Asteasu</a>, Lopetegui is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/12/spain-england-julen-lopetegui-wembley\">Real Sociedad fan</a> who was 14 when they won their first ever league,15 when they won their second. When Oyarzabal scored on Sunday night, it momentarily took them top for the first time in 17 years; it also saw Lopetegui\u2019s Sevilla, top seven days before, slip to eighth. A three-game week looked set to end in three defeats, the damage deep. When the third had gone in at Eibar, Cote catching them out with a free-kick, three goals conceded in 15 minutes, Lopetegui had turned to his goalkeeper coach sitting on the bench and momentarily lost his mind, the pressure revealed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff7b33361a491def3129b855741c6513fc2b24a4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff7b33361a491def3129b855741c6513fc2b24a4/0_89_2600_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sevilla\u2019s midfielder Mudo Vazquez (second left) celebrates his winner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sevilla\u2019s midfielder Mudo Vazquez (second left) celebrates his winner.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cristina Quicler/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What they said on Sunday night revealed it, too. \u201cThat was a tough blow; after Eibar it wasn\u2019t easy [to go behind so early],\u201d Jes\u00fas Navas admitted. But, Ocampos insisted: \u201cWe killed all the ghosts.\u201d Sevilla didn\u2019t collapse and didn\u2019t stop; instead, they rebelled, roaring back, running and running and then running some more, the full-backs particularly: if you go back to the Pizju\u00e1n now, you\u2019d probably find Navas and Reguil\u00f3n still whizzing up and down the wings. Even the ball-boys were brilliant, acting quickly to assist the second Sevilla goal. \u201cFrom the 15th minute to the 45th, they overwhelmed us,\u201d Real manager Imanol Alguacil admitted.</p> \n<p>The equaliser came after 18 minutes and via a <em>ridiculous</em> pass from Banega, who somehow plotted a path through five players, into a space that didn\u2019t exist. Oh, and with the foot he\u2019s only supposed to stand on. There, Nolito took it first time, on the bounce, bending it sidefooted into the corner. The second arrived immediately after half-time and it was almost as silly. La Real were caught by a quick delivery from the touchline and an even quicker Banega free-kick that found Ocampos on the right. He turned David Zurutuza with a backheel and belted it in from a tight angle.

      "bodyText": "There were three minutes gone when Adnan Januzaj produced the perfect pass for Mikel Oyarzabal to score the first goal and three minutes left when Martin \u00d8degaard produced the perfect pass for Cristian Portu to score the last. In the meantime, there were 22 more shots, three more goals, and nothing more they could give: \u201cLovely for fans, but not a goalie\u2019s favourite game,\u201d Real Sociedad goalkeeper Miguel \u00c1ngel Moy\u00e1 said, standing there smiling despite being defeated, aware that he\u2019d been part of something special. On the weekend when the centre of Spain became the centre of Spanish football, Barcelona travelling to Getafe and Real Madrid going to the Metropolitano to face Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, if they wanted a game that was genuinely good, they had to wait 24 hours and look south. Good? Sevilla v Real Sociedad, which finished 3-2, was brilliant, the match of the season so far and everything the Madrid derby hadn\u2019t been: fast, open, fun, full of great touches, four brilliant and a determination to win whatever the costs, a willingness to risk everything. \u201cWe wanted a match that was back and forth, but knew Sevilla would probably want that too,\u201d Moy\u00e1 said, and nor was it just that they went from one end to the other; it was how they did it, the pace, noise and nerves not diminishing the play. Instead it was enhanced, the ability breathtaking at times. Joan Jord\u00e1n smashed an absurd shot that no one saw coming. Or going, for that matter. Sergio Reguil\u00f3n scooped a pass so good it was silly. Jules Kound\u00e9 took off to connect with a flying volley. Lucas Ocampos, unstoppable every time he ran, thundered a shot in at the near post. And \u00d8degaard, who has made more opportunities than anyone else this season, smoothly presented Willian Jos\u00e9 with yet another open invitation. And those were some of the ones that didn\u2019t go in: Jord\u00e1n\u2019s shot flew back off the post, Reguil\u00f3n\u2019s fantasy didn\u2019t get the finish, Moya saved from Ocampos and watched Kound\u00e9\u2019s overhead kick fade a fraction wide, and Willian Jos\u00e9 sliced the best opportunity past the post, leaving Sevilla goalkeeper Tom\u00e1s Vaclik blowing out his cheeks. Which was pretty much how everyone felt at the end of this. Julen Lopetegui, especially. Sevilla\u2019s manager might have thought it was happening again, standing there on the touchline watching an uncomfortably familiar story unfold. His brief time as manager of Real Madrid, it\u2019s often forgotten, had begun well, the run reading win, win, win, draw, win, his team joint top of the table, until the night they went to Sevilla in week six, when it all fell apart. Defeated at the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n, they drew the next match with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, then went to the Basque Country and lost to a 95th minute goal at Alav\u00e9s, lost to Levante, everything unravelling, and got beaten at Barcelona. It was only October, but it was over. A year on, his time at Sevilla had started in a similar way, the run reading win, win, draw, win, his team top of the table, until the night they faced Real Madrid. Defeated at the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n, just as he had been the year before only on the other side now, they then went to the Basque Country and, despite leading 2-0 after half an hour, lost 3-2 to an 82nd minute goal at Eibar. Now, three days later, they were a goal down after just four minutes \u2013 and against his team too. The son of a champion stone-lifter from Asteasu, Lopetegui is a Real Sociedad fan who was 14 when they won their first ever league,15 when they won their second. When Oyarzabal scored on Sunday night, it momentarily took them top for the first time in 17 years; it also saw Lopetegui\u2019s Sevilla, top seven days before, slip to eighth. A three-game week looked set to end in three defeats, the damage deep. When the third had gone in at Eibar, Cote catching them out with a free-kick, three goals conceded in 15 minutes, Lopetegui had turned to his goalkeeper coach sitting on the bench and momentarily lost his mind, the pressure revealed. What they said on Sunday night revealed it, too. \u201cThat was a tough blow; after Eibar it wasn\u2019t easy [to go behind so early],\u201d Jes\u00fas Navas admitted. But, Ocampos insisted: \u201cWe killed all the ghosts.\u201d Sevilla didn\u2019t collapse and didn\u2019t stop; instead, they rebelled, roaring back, running and running and then running some more, the full-backs particularly: if you go back to the Pizju\u00e1n now, you\u2019d probably find Navas and Reguil\u00f3n still whizzing up and down the wings. Even the ball-boys were brilliant, acting quickly to assist the second Sevilla goal. \u201cFrom the 15th minute to the 45th, they overwhelmed us,\u201d Real manager Imanol Alguacil admitted. The equaliser came after 18 minutes and via a ridiculous pass from Banega, who somehow plotted a path through five players, into a space that didn\u2019t exist. Oh, and with the foot he\u2019s only supposed to stand on. There, Nolito took it first time, on the bounce, bending it sidefooted into the corner. The second arrived immediately after half-time and it was almost as silly. La Real were caught by a quick delivery from the touchline and an even quicker Banega free-kick that found Ocampos on the right. He turned David Zurutuza with a backheel and belted it in from a tight angle. Sevilla had turned it round but it was not over. At 2-1 la Real went for it: and with Oyarzabal, \u00d8degaard, Portu and Mikel Merino in midfield, Alexander Isak and Willian Jos\u00e9 up front, it opened even more, the pitch huge, the game accelerating. \u201cThere were loads of chances in both areas, more in ours,\u201d Alguacil said. Banega rolled just wide, Jord\u00e1n hit the post, and Willian Jos\u00e9 sliced that chance. Then Alejandro Pozo, a 20-year-old playing his second league game in three days and his second ever, beat Nacho Monreal, raced into the area and found Mudo V\u00e1zquez to score the third. There were only 10 minutes left, but it still wasn\u2019t over. \u00d8degaard\u2019s clever reverse pass saw Portu make it 3-2. When the board went up, it came with bad news: there were only three more minutes of this. It was too fun to finish now, but that\u2019s how it finished: 3-2 to Sevilla. \u201cSpectacular,\u201d Marca\u2019s headline ran, its match report pointedly opening on: \u201cWhat pace, what desire to win, what intensity, what a way to always look for goals: Sevilla and Real Sociedad demonstrated that they are two of the standout teams in Spain, showing that 0-0s are for little teams, no matter what their names and their budgets say.\u201d \u201cThere were nerves at 3-2,\u201d Lopetegui admitted. \u201cBut I think we deserved the win against a very demanding, very talented team that came here in a state of euphoria.

      "body": "<p>The panel show offers a TV lifeline to scores of comedians, but it has never taken off as a live format. I could see that changing if the industry catches on to what Brydon, Mack and Mitchell are up to on their Town to Town tour. It\u2019s as if the trio have asked themselves: how can we monetise the skills \u2013 and the camaraderie \u2013 honed over a decade on the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/21/would-i-lie-to-you-review-rob-brydon-david-mitchell\">Would I Lie to You?</a> Fair enough. They offer complementary qualities while each being adept at raillery, lively chatter and off-the-cuff gags. As per many a panel show, it\u2019s completely nonessential but passes the time entertainingly.</p> <p>Given the complaint that such TV is the cosy preserve of backslapping male comedians, perhaps it is regrettable that the show\u2019s set suggests a gentlemen\u2019s club: oak panels, upholstered chairs and even a moose head looming down from the back wall. There\u2019s something Rotarian, too, about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rob-brydon\">Rob Brydon</a>\u2019s introductory remarks, which include impersonations last novel in Mike Yarwood\u2019s day, and a hard-to-love standup routine about how weakly the ageing Brydon now pees.</p> <p>As on the small screen, Brydon plays host, firstly of a local knowledge quiz bespoke to each venue; and, after the interval, to a Q&amp;A casting our three amigos as agony uncles to life problems volunteered by the crowd. The format is vanishingly thin, and serves mainly excuses to crank up Brydon, Mitchell and Mack and watch them go. Most of the going falls to the latter, on whose Eric Morecambe-alike ebullience and unpredictability the show heavily depends.</p> <p>It is Mack who, in timeworn fashion, gets the audience laughing at itself \u2013 in this instance, because of the depressive cast to much of the Southend crowd\u2019s input.

      "bodyText": "The panel show offers a TV lifeline to scores of comedians, but it has never taken off as a live format. I could see that changing if the industry catches on to what Brydon, Mack and Mitchell are up to on their Town to Town tour. It\u2019s as if the trio have asked themselves: how can we monetise the skills \u2013 and the camaraderie \u2013 honed over a decade on the BBC\u2019s Would I Lie to You? Fair enough. They offer complementary qualities while each being adept at raillery, lively chatter and off-the-cuff gags. As per many a panel show, it\u2019s completely nonessential but passes the time entertainingly. Given the complaint that such TV is the cosy preserve of backslapping male comedians, perhaps it is regrettable that the show\u2019s set suggests a gentlemen\u2019s club: oak panels, upholstered chairs and even a moose head looming down from the back wall. There\u2019s something Rotarian, too, about Rob Brydon\u2019s introductory remarks, which include impersonations last novel in Mike Yarwood\u2019s day, and a hard-to-love standup routine about how weakly the ageing Brydon now pees. As on the small screen, Brydon plays host, firstly of a local knowledge quiz bespoke to each venue; and, after the interval, to a Q&amp;A casting our three amigos as agony uncles to life problems volunteered by the crowd. The format is vanishingly thin, and serves mainly excuses to crank up Brydon, Mitchell and Mack and watch them go. Most of the going falls to the latter, on whose Eric Morecambe-alike ebullience and unpredictability the show heavily depends. It is Mack who, in timeworn fashion, gets the audience laughing at itself \u2013 in this instance, because of the depressive cast to much of the Southend crowd\u2019s input. This is not, goes the evening\u2019s running joke, a town overburdened with self-esteem. That much is evident from the local quiz, when Brydon\u2019s request for Southend\u2019s most famous person and best visitor attraction yield few results. The first half highlights find Mitchell extrapolating a geographical principle from the inaccuracy of the name Southend-on-Sea and Mack berating the audience for noticing water drops coming from the ceiling on to the centre of the stage. In the audience advice bureau that comprises act two, the joke is often in the brusqueness of the advice rendered \u2013 be that Brydon urging a teenager to defy her \u201chag\u201d of a mum (who she is sitting next to) and pursue her university dreams, or Mack expressing dismay at one singleton\u2019s efforts to find love. (\u201cWhat are you doing to get a date?\u201d he asks. \u201cLooking at passersby,\u201d comes the bathetic reply.) It all amounts to precious little; there is neither structure nor climax.

      "body": "<p>Hedge fund millionaires backing Boris Johnson will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/ex-top-civil-servant-hammond-was-right-to-query-no-deal-backers\">make a killing</a> from a no-deal Brexit, according to the former chancellor Philip Hammond. The claim is these \u201cshort sellers\u201d are betting on big falls in share prices and the value of sterling in what critics say is a classic example of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/disaster-capitalists-no-deal-brexit-environment\">disaster capitalism</a>\u201d. But how do they do it, who are they and are they all merchants of doom?</p> <h2><strong>Tell me how shorting works</strong></h2> <p>The conventional way to make money from shares is to buy at a low price then sell at a high price. It is called going long. Shorting is the opposite: buying high and selling low.</p> <p>The approach of hedge funds is to target a share they believe is heading for a fall. But the only way to make a profit is by not really owning those shares in the first place, rather \u201cborrowing\u201d them. Typically, the hedge fund borrows them, at a small fee, from a pension fund that is holding them for the long term.</p> <p>The investor (speculator is probably a better word) borrows, say, 10,000 BP shares and promises to return them at a fixed time \u2013 let\u2019s say in a month. The speculator instantly sells the BP shares at the going market price \u2013 say 500p, giving them \u00a350,000.</p> <p>In a month\u2019s time, when they have to return the shares to the pension fund, the shares have fallen to, say, 400p. So the speculator goes into the market, buys 10,000 shares for \u00a340,000 and hands them back, making a profit of \u00a310,000 along the way. But if the shares have risen to 600p, they will make a loss of \u00a310,000.</p> <p>The reality is rather more sophisticated than this \u2013 speculators rarely take actual delivery of shares, and use other methods such as CFDs (contracts for difference) and short ETFs (exchange traded funds) \u2013 but the principle is the same.</p> <h2><strong>Sounds super. Should I try it?</strong></h2> <p>Probably not. The most you can lose when investing conventionally is the value of the share. In shorting, it\u2019s possible to lose more. If the share you are shorting soars in price then you have to go back into the market and pay for it \u2013 possibly much more than your original investment. It\u2019s one reason the Financial Conduct Authority is not especially keen on shorting among small investors.</p> <p>But it\u2019s surprising how accessible shorting has become for retail investors. ETFs in particular are cheap to buy and easy to trade, such as those that promise to move higher every time the FTSE 100 index falls. For example, Legal &amp; General has a FTSE 100 Super Short Strategy fund that gives you a 2% gain for every 1% fall in the FTSE 100, and is <a href=\"https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/l/legal-and-general-etf-ftse-100-super-short-2x\">available for sale</a> on Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s platform.</p> <h2><strong>So who is really doing it?</strong></h2> <p>The reality is that the big money from shorting is made by a relatively small club of extremely wealthy individuals. Every day, the FCA <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/short-selling/notification-and-disclosure-net-short-positions\">publishes a list</a> of which shares are being shorted and who is doing the shorting. <a href=\"https://shorttracker.co.uk/\">Shorttracker.co.uk</a> also maintains a useful update. The same names crop up again and again \u2013 Marshall Wace, Odey Asset Management, GLG, AQR and BlackRock.</p> <p>Marshall Wace manages about $39bn (\u00a332bn) from its Mayfair HQ, and was founded by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace. In January, they <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/let-s-hurry-up-with-brexit-there-will-be-benefits-for-all-nbwrln2vs\">penned an article</a> for the Times (paywall) titled: \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up with Brexit: there will be benefits for all.\u201d</p> <p>Crispin Odey of Odey Asset Management has donated almost \u00a3900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns, and also placed huge bets against the pound and government bonds in the run-up to the EU referendum. It is estimated he made a \u00a3220m profit when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">sterling collapsed</a> after the leave victory.</p> <h2><strong>Are they counting on a hard Brexit?</strong></h2> <p>Yes and no. Clearly some of the positions taken by Odey and Marshall Wace will pay off if there is a crash-out Brexit and UK-facing stocks are hit hard. Fund managers say the sectors most vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit are companies that make most of their profits in the UK rather than abroad \u2013 such as housebuilders and retailers \u2013 and Odey is in a lot of them.</p> <p>Odey has big short positions against Intu Properties, which runs 17 shopping centres across the UK, the retailer Debenhams, and the housebuilders Berkeley Group and Cairn Homes.</p> <p>But he also has a big position against Lancashire Holdings, a London- and Bermuda-based insurer involved in aviation, energy and marine insurance. Another of his big shorts is in IG Group \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest providers of CFDs, the very instrument most used to carry out shorting.</p> <p>Marshall Wace has a broader spread of shorts, covering 41 companies in the UK and overseas. Broadly speaking, these are UK-facing with a likelihood of being damaged by Brexit, but Marshall Wace\u2019s shorts include Mexican gold producers and South African diamond mines.</p> <h2><strong>Are all the hedge fund shorters Brexit</strong><strong>ers?</strong></h2> <p>Not necessarily. Big institutions and pension funds also participate in shorting. For example, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is a big short seller, with currently large disclosed bets against Pearson, Balfour Beatty and Provident Financial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Do you have to have an address in Mayfair?</strong></h2> <p>Hedge funds prefer the West End of London rather than the City or Canary Wharf, reflecting their super-rich clients. Marshall Wace\u2019s head office is on Sloane Street in Chelsea, while Odey\u2019s office in Mayfair is a short stroll from the Dorchester hotel. In the US, they seem to cluster around Greenwich, Connecticut, a super-rich enclave just outside New York.</p> <h2><strong>Do they all make gazilli</strong><strong>ons?</strong></h2> <p>Many hedge funds made a fortune when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/22/thomas-cook-in-last-ditch-talks-to-avoid-collapse\">Thomas Cook went under</a>. But a lot of them are not very good at it. When working for other investors, they tend to charge 2% upfront plus 20% of any gain, but on average produce poor returns. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-09/hedge-fund-performance-in-2018-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly\">According to Bloomberg</a>, the hedge fund industry gave investors a 4.1% loss in 2018, although an Odey fund was top of the table with a 53% gain.</p>",

The claim is these \u201cshort sellers\u201d are betting on big falls in share prices and the value of sterling in what critics say is a classic example of \u201cdisaster capitalism\u201d. But how do they do it, who are they and are they all merchants of doom? Tell me how shorting works The conventional way to make money from shares is to buy at a low price then sell at a high price. It is called going long. Shorting is the opposite: buying high and selling low. The approach of hedge funds is to target a share they believe is heading for a fall. But the only way to make a profit is by not really owning those shares in the first place, rather \u201cborrowing\u201d them. Typically, the hedge fund borrows them, at a small fee, from a pension fund that is holding them for the long term. The investor (speculator is probably a better word) borrows, say, 10,000 BP shares and promises to return them at a fixed time \u2013 let\u2019s say in a month. The speculator instantly sells the BP shares at the going market price \u2013 say 500p, giving them \u00a350,000. In a month\u2019s time, when they have to return the shares to the pension fund, the shares have fallen to, say, 400p. So the speculator goes into the market, buys 10,000 shares for \u00a340,000 and hands them back, making a profit of \u00a310,000 along the way. But if the shares have risen to 600p, they will make a loss of \u00a310,000. The reality is rather more sophisticated than this \u2013 speculators rarely take actual delivery of shares, and use other methods such as CFDs (contracts for difference) and short ETFs (exchange traded funds) \u2013 but the principle is the same. Sounds super. Should I try it? Probably not. The most you can lose when investing conventionally is the value of the share. In shorting, it\u2019s possible to lose more. If the share you are shorting soars in price then you have to go back into the market and pay for it \u2013 possibly much more than your original investment. It\u2019s one reason the Financial Conduct Authority is not especially keen on shorting among small investors. But it\u2019s surprising how accessible shorting has become for retail investors. ETFs in particular are cheap to buy and easy to trade, such as those that promise to move higher every time the FTSE 100 index falls. For example, Legal &amp; General has a FTSE 100 Super Short Strategy fund that gives you a 2% gain for every 1% fall in the FTSE 100, and is available for sale on Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s platform. So who is really doing it? The reality is that the big money from shorting is made by a relatively small club of extremely wealthy individuals. Every day, the FCA publishes a list of which shares are being shorted and who is doing the shorting. Shorttracker.co.uk also maintains a useful update. The same names crop up again and again \u2013 Marshall Wace, Odey Asset Management, GLG, AQR and BlackRock. Marshall Wace manages about $39bn (\u00a332bn) from its Mayfair HQ, and was founded by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace. In January, they penned an article for the Times (paywall) titled: \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up with Brexit: there will be benefits for all.\u201d Crispin Odey of Odey Asset Management has donated almost \u00a3900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns, and also placed huge bets against the pound and government bonds in the run-up to the EU referendum. It is estimated he made a \u00a3220m profit when sterling collapsed after the leave victory. Are they counting on a hard Brexit? Yes and no. Clearly some of the positions taken by Odey and Marshall Wace will pay off if there is a crash-out Brexit and UK-facing stocks are hit hard. Fund managers say the sectors most vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit are companies that make most of their profits in the UK rather than abroad \u2013 such as housebuilders and retailers \u2013 and Odey is in a lot of them. Odey has big short positions against Intu Properties, which runs 17 shopping centres across the UK, the retailer Debenhams, and the housebuilders Berkeley Group and Cairn Homes. But he also has a big position against Lancashire Holdings, a London- and Bermuda-based insurer involved in aviation, energy and marine insurance. Another of his big shorts is in IG Group \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest providers of CFDs, the very instrument most used to carry out shorting. Marshall Wace has a broader spread of shorts, covering 41 companies in the UK and overseas. Broadly speaking, these are UK-facing with a likelihood of being damaged by Brexit, but Marshall Wace\u2019s shorts include Mexican gold producers and South African diamond mines. Are all the hedge fund shorters Brexiters? Not necessarily. Big institutions and pension funds also participate in shorting. For example, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is a big short seller, with currently large disclosed bets against Pearson, Balfour Beatty and Provident Financial. Do you have to have an address in Mayfair? Hedge funds prefer the West End of London rather than the City or Canary Wharf, reflecting their super-rich clients. Marshall Wace\u2019s head office is on Sloane Street in Chelsea, while Odey\u2019s office in Mayfair is a short stroll from the Dorchester hotel. In the US, they seem to cluster around Greenwich, Connecticut, a super-rich enclave just outside New York. Do they all make gazillions? Many hedge funds made a fortune when Thomas Cook went under. But a lot of them are not very good at it. When working for other investors, they tend to charge 2% upfront plus 20% of any gain, but on average produce poor returns. According to Bloomberg, the hedge fund industry gave investors a 4.1% loss in 2018, although an Odey fund was top of the table with a 53% gain.",

In liberal democracies the notion that politicians will uphold basic values of honesty has long been a given. It means delivering on what you promise and doing as you said you would \u2013 or paying an electoral price if you fail. With ever closer media scrutiny and the growing reach of social media, an even deeper correlation between the private and public self has been demanded of politicians. They have to be true to themselves, not just true to their word.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"821a5964b294412a51d12e29a5818c430b502c24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/821a5964b294412a51d12e29a5818c430b502c24/0_95_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ascot racegoers wearing masks of Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It occurred to few on the pluralist side of politics that Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson actually meant to do what they said.\u2019 Ascot racegoers wearing masks of Farage, Johnson and Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Populists have been quick to turn the value placed on authenticity to their advantage. Not by striving to be truthful, but by demonstrating that they are authentic (or instinctively connected to the experience of \u201cthe people\u201d, who are authentic) to the point of not caring about being shown to be liars \u2013 as long as the lies are told \u201cin the interest of the people\u201d.

Two factors are at play. One is whether there is a limit to the lies that voters will tolerate \u2013 and the jury is still out. Polls have not registered a decline in the support base for either Johnson or Salvini. Support for the far-right Austrian Freedom party (FPO) slipped by a third in the weekend\u2019s general election as voters apparently punished leader Heinz-Christian Strache <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz6BeEVVCjc\" title=\"\">for a corruption scandal</a> that brought down the coalition government. The result might plausibly suggest though that the FPO paid a price for behaving like old-fashioned politicians, rather than modern populists. Had Strache adopted a more shameless Berlusconi/Johnson style, the FPO might well have done better. After all, the point is to own the bad behaviour.</p> <p> True, Salvini has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/matteo-salvini-replaced-by-migration-specialist-in-new-italy-coalition\" title=\"\">dislodged from government</a> in Italy for now, but that may have been because he over-reached tactically. And if Johnson suffers from the supreme court\u2019s verdict on his shutting down of parliament, it is because he underestimated the resilience of parliament and the judiciary.</p> <p>Limiting the advantage populists can gain from their bombast may ultimately have more to do with the skill of mainstream politicians and institutions. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/23/eu-nations-come-to-italys-aid-over-relocating-migrants\" title=\"\">EU\u2019s new approach</a> to the rules of migration management, for example, may help roll back Europe\u2019s populist moment. Even if voters are not bothered by the lying, populist parties may simply find themselves outmanoeuvred.</p> <p>A second issue is political culture. All populists have lying in their DNA, but they do not exist in cultural circumstances of their own making. In a culture where directness (or bluntness) and trust are highly valued, such as the Netherlands, breaking taboos around multiculturalism and political correctness is a perversely effective way to claim authenticity. Geert Wilders, with his talk of taxing hijabs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/09/geert-wilders-found-guilty-in-hate-speech-trial-but-no-sentence-imposed\" title=\"\">vitriolic statements</a> about Islam, was a master of the outlandish statement twinned with a claim to authentic Dutchness.</p> <p>In high-trust political cultures where transparency is a vital ingredient of political life \u2013 the Nordic countries, for instance (Swedish politicians as a matter of course share details of their tax returns) \u2013 matters are even more interesting. On the one hand lying is more taboo than elsewhere. But the simple act of accusing mainstream parties of lying, the merest suggestion that elites are being inauthentic \u2013 as the populist parties have done in Denmark and Sweden \u2013 can attract voters looking for the frisson of breaking with the norms of mainstream politics. Germany offers a variation of this: a political culture where the spectre of racial and ethnic exclusion is such that the far-right AfD can gain a disruptively \u201cauthentic\u201d appeal simply by using a few choice expressions and references that evoke Germany\u2019s darkest days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2019/mar/06/revealed-the-rise-and-rise-of-populist-rhetoric\">Revealed: the rise and rise of populist rhetoric</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By contrast, in political cultures where mistrust and cynicism run high, such as Italy, the currency of politics is already disbelief, so the worst mistake Salvini could have made was to start believing his own hype. The minute he called for new elections and moved against his coalition partners in a grab for power, he overplayed his hand. There may be little electoral cost to lying (think of Silvio Berlusconi) but there is a high price to be paid for drinking your own Kool-Aid.</p> <p>In the UK, where irony is the currency of choice, populism is perhaps at its most dangerous because no one takes it seriously until it\u2019s too late. It occurred to few on the pluralist side of politics that Nigel Farage and Johnson actually meant to do what they said. That they were, in other words, not being ironic. For all the sophistication of the British polity, few people took their authenticity as seriously as they ought to have. Until now.</p> <p>We need to stop asking why voters believe populists\u2019 untruths and why they let themselves be repeatedly swindled by them \u2013 because they don\u2019t and they aren\u2019t. The purpose of populist lying is not to be believed. Only very belatedly do we seem to be grasping that the politics of lying and shameless behaviour are powerful elements in populism\u2019s corrosive ideology.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Fieschi is the author of <a href=\"https://www.agendapub.com/books/48/populocracy\" title=\"\">Populocracy</a>: The Tyranny of Authenticity and the Rise of Populism</p>",

True, Salvini has been dislodged from government in Italy for now, but that may have been because he over-reached tactically. And if Johnson suffers from the supreme court\u2019s verdict on his shutting down of parliament, it is because he underestimated the resilience of parliament and the judiciary. Limiting the advantage populists can gain from their bombast may ultimately have more to do with the skill of mainstream politicians and institutions. The EU\u2019s new approach to the rules of migration management, for example, may help roll back Europe\u2019s populist moment. Even if voters are not bothered by the lying, populist parties may simply find themselves outmanoeuvred. A second issue is political culture. All populists have lying in their DNA, but they do not exist in cultural circumstances of their own making. In a culture where directness (or bluntness) and trust are highly valued, such as the Netherlands, breaking taboos around multiculturalism and political correctness is a perversely effective way to claim authenticity. Geert Wilders, with his talk of taxing hijabs and vitriolic statements about Islam, was a master of the outlandish statement twinned with a claim to authentic Dutchness. In high-trust political cultures where transparency is a vital ingredient of political life \u2013 the Nordic countries, for instance (Swedish politicians as a matter of course share details of their tax returns) \u2013 matters are even more interesting. On the one hand lying is more taboo than elsewhere. But the simple act of accusing mainstream parties of lying, the merest suggestion that elites are being inauthentic \u2013 as the populist parties have done in Denmark and Sweden \u2013 can attract voters looking for the frisson of breaking with the norms of mainstream politics. Germany offers a variation of this: a political culture where the spectre of racial and ethnic exclusion is such that the far-right AfD can gain a disruptively \u201cauthentic\u201d appeal simply by using a few choice expressions and references that evoke Germany\u2019s darkest days. By contrast, in political cultures where mistrust and cynicism run high, such as Italy, the currency of politics is already disbelief, so the worst mistake Salvini could have made was to start believing his own hype. The minute he called for new elections and moved against his coalition partners in a grab for power, he overplayed his hand. There may be little electoral cost to lying (think of Silvio Berlusconi) but there is a high price to be paid for drinking your own Kool-Aid. In the UK, where irony is the currency of choice, populism is perhaps at its most dangerous because no one takes it seriously until it\u2019s too late. It occurred to few on the pluralist side of politics that Nigel Farage and Johnson actually meant to do what they said. That they were, in other words, not being ironic. For all the sophistication of the British polity, few people took their authenticity as seriously as they ought to have. Until now. We need to stop asking why voters believe populists\u2019 untruths and why they let themselves be repeatedly swindled by them \u2013 because they don\u2019t and they aren\u2019t. The purpose of populist lying is not to be believed. Only very belatedly do we seem to be grasping that the politics of lying and shameless behaviour are powerful elements in populism\u2019s corrosive ideology. \u2022 Catherine Fieschi is the author of Populocracy: The Tyranny of Authenticity and the Rise of Populism",

It has already welcomed more than a million visitors since it opened in the summer of 2016. Enjoy a glass of wine in the eighth-floor panoramic bar, Le Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, before embarking on Bordeaux\u2019s Urban Wine Trail, which takes visitors on a self-guided tour of Bordeaux\u2019s best bars, some of which have up to 1,000 different wines.</p> <p>Le Vertige serves cheese and charcuterie boards with its long list of wines.

La Ligne Rouge specialises in little-known wines from foreign <em>domaines</em> including Serbia, Croatia and an English sparkly. It is on the left bank beside one of the oldest bars in Bordeaux, the Grand Bar Castan, a great place to watch the world go by \u2013 cars, trams, boats, cyclists and rollerbladers all pass in front of the bar, the interior of which is lined with art nouveau <em>rocaille</em> \u2013 an indoor cave with giant palm tree decoration.</p> <p>And don\u2019t miss the Bordeaux Wine Council\u2019s Bar \u00e0 Vin, in the city\u2019s flatiron building, la Maison Gobineau. Quality wines cost a fraction of what they do elsewhere, and it\u2019s a unique place to drink a glass of Bordeaux sup\u00e9rieur (\u20ac2) or a pomerol (\u20ac8) beneath an Aubusson tapestry and stained glass windows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48492dad310ecb7c3ce4b45ae9ba47d952665e1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48492dad310ecb7c3ce4b45ae9ba47d952665e1e/0_416_4134_2481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panorama Ch de La Dauphine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ch\u00e2teau de La Dauphine offers tours by 2CV</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alternatively, you might like to take a wine tour of one of the surrounding ch\u00e2teaux. Wine trails can be organised by boat, bicycle, on foot, hot-air balloon, donkey or horse-drawn carriage. Besides a vineyard tour by bicycle or electric scooter, the Ch\u00e2teau Marquis de Terme in the M\u00e9doc hosts a three-hour tasting of seven grands crus class\u00e9s wines in the 19th-century workshop. The selection of choice vintages includes pauillac, saint-julien, saint-est\u00e8phe, margaux and haut-m\u00e9doc with Barsac and sauternes dessert wines to complete a full house of the left bank of the Garonne\u2019s most exceptional wines. The sommelier explains the history and essential characteristics of what makes each wine special. Equally refined, dine at the Ch\u00e2teau Lafaurie Peyraguey\u2019s Restaurant Lalique, which was awarded the Sauternes region\u2019s first and only Michelin star in 2019. At Ch\u00e2teau de La Dauphine, take a heritage tour in a bright red 2CV car with hilltop tastings accompanied by lamprey rillettes and truffle butter. Stay on in Saint-\u00c9milion for a cooking class in the kitchens of the Ch\u00e2teau Ambe Tour Pourret. The lesson involves preparing a meal with seasonal, local products and then tasting it with the vineyard\u2019s wine (\u20ac120-\u20ac160 per person).

The rooms are named after Bordeaux\u2019s vineyards, there\u2019s the in-house wine bar, large cellar and the <em>sommelier</em> Riccardo Mariconti gives tastings twice a day. \u201cWe choose five wines to taste, starting with something light and fruity, moving on to m\u00e9doc, and discuss the acidity, tannins and talk about why guests like a certain appellation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"424011a498a883958758f21cb32376446ce44e7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/424011a498a883958758f21cb32376446ce44e7c/0_896_3583_4478/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bordeaux rive droite-24\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beer lovers should try Brasserie de la Lune\u2019s Darwin pale ale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Delune</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Broaden your drinking palate<br></strong>It\u2019s hard to believe, but there are other things to drink in Bordeaux besides wine. As well as having one of the city\u2019s most romantic restaurant gardens, Frida shakes up fabulous cocktails from its glinting bar in the historic centre. For beer lovers, the Brasserie de la Lune\u2019s Darwin pale ale is served on the sand-covered terrace of the Chantiers de la Garonne.</p> <p>For something stronger, pay a visit to Moon Harbour, Bordeaux\u2019s whisky distillery, which was set up by two local friends in the redeveloping Bacalan docks and will produce its first single malt whisky next year. The highlight of the visit is the <em>chai</em> (storage area), which was originally constructed by the Germans during the second world war as a giant concrete fuel depot (the size of a zeppelin) for their submarine base next door. Although wartime events saw that no fuel ever made it into the vast concrete blockhouse, it\u2019s a piece of Bordeaux\u2019s urban history, an astonishing sight and worth a tipple of whisky to experience.</p> <p>To complete the drinking half of your bucket list, Bordeaux is only 90 minutes\u2019 drive from Cognac. All the great Cognac houses including Hennessey, Camus, R\u00e9my Martin, and Martell offer tours and tastings, but Cognac itself is a charming town whose devotion to the fermented <em>ugni blanc</em> grape has lasted unabated since the early 1700s.</p> <p><strong>Taste regional specialities at local food markets<br></strong>The Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, including Bordeaux, is a must for foodies. The most picturesque market is at Royan, where 150 traders sell delights such as purple asparagus from Blaye, green asparagus from Les Landes, with oysters and cuttlefish from the Bay of Arcachon. At Brive-La-Gaillarde and Sarlat\u2019s in the Dordogne, market stalls are overflowing with vegetables, dried duck, nougat and honey. Join the locals in the queue at the cheese counter or watch as the restaurateurs squeeze the fruit and search for the best truffles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b934a5c42b8442c847a68b6122a9c6988d9b76b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b934a5c42b8442c847a68b6122a9c6988d9b76b9/0_405_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"2017 e\u0301te\u0301 marche\u0301 central touristes vue haute a.valli (4)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The market at Royan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ArnAud-Valliiiii/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You could also visit one of Bordeaux\u2019s two new food halls. Opposite the Cit\u00e9 du Vin is the Halles de Bacalan, with 24 food merchants offering the region\u2019s best <em>cuisine du march\u00e9</em>. Chef Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Coiff\u00e9 of L\u2019\u00c9choppe des Halles serves up to 200 dishes a day: delicious combinations of steak, duck, octopus or pork served on orange platters to share. For Coiff\u00e9, it\u2019s \u201cthe future of food; simple, local products served in a fun, convivial atmosphere.\u201d At the other end of Bordeaux is La Boca food hall, which opened last year and houses 15 food bars with giant shared tables in the middle, a chance to eat Mexican, Thai, Italian, Basque, local seafood and then try a dune blanche from Chez Pascal, a bite-sized choux pastry, originally from Cap Ferret.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/best-of-bordeaux/2019/sep/30/eight-top-tips-for-the-perfect-bordeaux-break\">Eight top tips for the perfect Bordeaux break</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Dine out in style<br></strong>Bordeaux is famed for its brasseries and bistros, many of which have been there since the mid-19th century.

Quality wines cost a fraction of what they do elsewhere, and it\u2019s a unique place to drink a glass of Bordeaux sup\u00e9rieur (\u20ac2) or a pomerol (\u20ac8) beneath an Aubusson tapestry and stained glass windows. Alternatively, you might like to take a wine tour of one of the surrounding ch\u00e2teaux. Wine trails can be organised by boat, bicycle, on foot, hot-air balloon, donkey or horse-drawn carriage. Besides a vineyard tour by bicycle or electric scooter, the Ch\u00e2teau Marquis de Terme in the M\u00e9doc hosts a three-hour tasting of seven grands crus class\u00e9s wines in the 19th-century workshop. The selection of choice vintages includes pauillac, saint-julien, saint-est\u00e8phe, margaux and haut-m\u00e9doc with Barsac and sauternes dessert wines to complete a full house of the left bank of the Garonne\u2019s most exceptional wines. The sommelier explains the history and essential characteristics of what makes each wine special. Equally refined, dine at the Ch\u00e2teau Lafaurie Peyraguey\u2019s Restaurant Lalique, which was awarded the Sauternes region\u2019s first and only Michelin star in 2019. At Ch\u00e2teau de La Dauphine, take a heritage tour in a bright red 2CV car with hilltop tastings accompanied by lamprey rillettes and truffle butter. Stay on in Saint-\u00c9milion for a cooking class in the kitchens of the Ch\u00e2teau Ambe Tour Pourret. The lesson involves preparing a meal with seasonal, local products and then tasting it with the vineyard\u2019s wine (\u20ac120-\u20ac160 per person). You won\u2019t ever want to leave. Back in Bordeaux, serious wine lovers should consider a stay at the excellent Le Boutique hotel. The rooms are named after Bordeaux\u2019s vineyards, there\u2019s the in-house wine bar, large cellar and the sommelier Riccardo Mariconti gives tastings twice a day. \u201cWe choose five wines to taste, starting with something light and fruity, moving on to m\u00e9doc, and discuss the acidity, tannins and talk about why guests like a certain appellation.\u201d Broaden your drinking palate It\u2019s hard to believe, but there are other things to drink in Bordeaux besides wine. As well as having one of the city\u2019s most romantic restaurant gardens, Frida shakes up fabulous cocktails from its glinting bar in the historic centre. For beer lovers, the Brasserie de la Lune\u2019s Darwin pale ale is served on the sand-covered terrace of the Chantiers de la Garonne. For something stronger, pay a visit to Moon Harbour, Bordeaux\u2019s whisky distillery, which was set up by two local friends in the redeveloping Bacalan docks and will produce its first single malt whisky next year. The highlight of the visit is the chai (storage area), which was originally constructed by the Germans during the second world war as a giant concrete fuel depot (the size of a zeppelin) for their submarine base next door. Although wartime events saw that no fuel ever made it into the vast concrete blockhouse, it\u2019s a piece of Bordeaux\u2019s urban history, an astonishing sight and worth a tipple of whisky to experience. To complete the drinking half of your bucket list, Bordeaux is only 90 minutes\u2019 drive from Cognac. All the great Cognac houses including Hennessey, Camus, R\u00e9my Martin, and Martell offer tours and tastings, but Cognac itself is a charming town whose devotion to the fermented ugni blanc grape has lasted unabated since the early 1700s. Taste regional specialities at local food markets The Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, including Bordeaux, is a must for foodies. The most picturesque market is at Royan, where 150 traders sell delights such as purple asparagus from Blaye, green asparagus from Les Landes, with oysters and cuttlefish from the Bay of Arcachon. At Brive-La-Gaillarde and Sarlat\u2019s in the Dordogne, market stalls are overflowing with vegetables, dried duck, nougat and honey. Join the locals in the queue at the cheese counter or watch as the restaurateurs squeeze the fruit and search for the best truffles. You could also visit one of Bordeaux\u2019s two new food halls. Opposite the Cit\u00e9 du Vin is the Halles de Bacalan, with 24 food merchants offering the region\u2019s best cuisine du march\u00e9. Chef Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Coiff\u00e9 of L\u2019\u00c9choppe des Halles serves up to 200 dishes a day: delicious combinations of steak, duck, octopus or pork served on orange platters to share. For Coiff\u00e9, it\u2019s \u201cthe future of food; simple, local products served in a fun, convivial atmosphere.\u201d At the other end of Bordeaux is La Boca food hall, which opened last year and houses 15 food bars with giant shared tables in the middle, a chance to eat Mexican, Thai, Italian, Basque, local seafood and then try a dune blanche from Chez Pascal, a bite-sized choux pastry, originally from Cap Ferret. Dine out in style Bordeaux is famed for its brasseries and bistros, many of which have been there since the mid-19th century. Try the traditional La Belle Epoque, or Le Quatri\u00e8me Mur \u2013 recommended by EasyJet\u2019s crew performance manager, Renaud Herin. Save up for a meal at Le Chapon Fin, a posh restaurant frequented by Sarah Bernhardt and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. For a more modern menu, head to one of Bordeaux\u2019s most sought-after tables at Racines, where Glasgow-born chef Daniel Gallacher serves creative, delectable food inspired by his Scottish roots and training under Alain Ducasse. End the evening with a diamant noir, a sugar-coated, ganache dark chocolate by Cadiot-Badie, which has been making confectionary since 1826. Don\u2019t leave Bordeaux without \u2026 Tasting the local speciality, a canel\u00e9, a tiny vanilla and rum-flavoured cake that looks like a miniature fluted jelly mould. The inside is spongy and the outside is a delicate caramelised crust. Locals eat them for breakfast, elevenses, lunch and dinnertime, and they can even be paired with Bordeaux wine.

So there was soft-power tailoring, a staple since McCartney\u2019s days as a trainee on Savile Row, in shades of peach, toffee and soft, unbleached white. There were 1970s-bohemian denim skirts, and silk blouses with scalloped edges. Amber Valetta, who had taken part in the previous evening\u2019s sustainability discussion, wore a moss-green silk trench, while the wildflower prints on silk dresses came from photos McCartney took on bike rides through the English countryside. With recycled polyester, organic cotton, regenerated cashmere and handbags made of sustainable raffia or second-life plastics, it marked the brand\u2019s most sustainable collection to date. \u201cBut I hope that when you watch the show you don\u2019t even notice that, actually,\u201d the designer said backstage. \u201cI hope that it\u2019s just desirable and beautiful and luxurious.\u201d The brand has partnered with resale company TheRealReal in a deal which incentivises McCartney\u2019s designer shoppers to participate in the circular economy by reselling their purchases. \u201cWe spend a lot of time on fabric technology, but the circular economy is another huge part of the story,\u201d said McCartney. \u201cThe youth of today, really they should be wearing vintage and secondhand clothes, and looking at renting clothes - and they are absolutely doing that. Fabric innovation, combined with this youth culture - it\u2019s exciting.\u201d But despite her championing of the circular economy, McCartney is expanding the brand. Backstage after the show, alongside her father, Sir Paul, and fellow fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, she was joined by her new business partners, the Arnault family who control LVMH. In July, one year after having bought back full control of her brand from her initial backers, Kering, McCartney announced that she was partnering with LVMH, the world\u2019s biggest luxury house. She remains majority shareholder, but the deep pockets of LMVH, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, bring the opportunity for accelerated growth. As part of the agreement, McCartney holds the role of special adviser on sustainability to Bernard Arnault. Natalia Vodianova, longtime favourite model of McCartney and wife of LVMH scion Antoine Arnault, did not appear on the catwalk this season but sat front row in a new-season Koba coat. Made from recycled polyester blended with a corn byproduct, Koba is a breakthrough in faux fur, a process that previously relied on environmentally damaging petroleum-based products.",

We even wrote a script from the novel and I played Gabriel Oak! The book is still dear to me. Since then I\u2019ve also read \u201cTess of the D\u2019Urbervilles\u201d (the novel that made him world-famous), \u201cJude the Obscure\u201d, \u201cThe Return of the Native\u201d, and \u201cThe Mayor of Casterbridge\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/sep/23/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos</a> from last week.</p> <p>First, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12954924\">BlogWriter </a>shows it\u2019s never too late to read Graham Greene:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just finished Graham Greene\u2019s The Power and the Glory, almost half a century after I first became aware of its existence. A great author, he compels you to step into his characters\u2019 shoes and live their agonies and tribulations from the inside. And then he leaves you thinking.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Perils of Perception by Bobby Duffy is a \u201cmust-read\u201d, says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10493280\">rgilyead</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Duffy is the MD of IPSOS Mori so knows a lot about surveys of people\u2019s understanding of political issues. In this book he explores the gap between what people think and reality. Depressingly, the gap is often enormous. A typical example is on immigration. When asked what proportion of the population are immigrants, British respondents said 25% when the reality is 13%, almost half. They also thought that refugees and asylum seekers made up a third of that number when the actual figure is 10%. What is worse, when confronted with the facts, those surveyed tried to justify their ignorance or deny the statistics altogether \u2026 One of the challenges he sets is to make your own guesses at the facts before he reveals the true answers. To my shame, I often got things wrong. It certainly made me think.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Gene: An Intimate History by Siddhartha Mukherjee has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/787724\">Tempusfugit</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>His Emperor of All Maladies knocked my socks off and educated me about cancer. This is doing just the same about the gene and genetics. I often look out to the stars and think \u2018How has all of this come about?\u2019 This book has me looking within and getting answers to the same question. How these singular building blocks come to work together to create such complexity is fascinating - and elegant and beautiful.</p> </blockquote> <p>Miriam Toews \u201calways brings the goods\u201d, says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15134444\">katcalls </a>and Women Talking is \u201cno different\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Here, the women of a Mennonite community debate whether to leave their home after finding out that a group of men in their community has been tranquilising and raping the women and children of the village. It is based on the true story of a Mennonite community in Brazil. Some sentences here hit me very close to the bone and I had to sit back and take the occasional breather. A gripping read.</p> </blockquote> <p>Richard Flanagan\u2019s The Unknown Terrorist has disturbed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13121203\">paulburns</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An utterly bleak vision of contemporary Australia. The Doll, a pole-dancer in Sydney\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, is mistakenly identified as a terrorist after a scare about three bombs in a Sydney Sports Stadium. (In Australia you could blow up the Opera House and get away with it, but blowing up a sports stadium is just unforgivable.) A media pile on, led by a sleazy TV journalist, Richard Cody, convinces the country and the government and opposition that the Doll is a major terrorist, when all she has done is slept overnight with a young Arab, also mistakenly identified as a terrorist \u2026 what is truly disturbing about this book, set in the too-real sleaze and corruption of early 21st century Kings Cross, is that with the current overreach of Australia\u2019s terror laws, which Flanagan brilliantly exposes, it could happen to any of us.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12546532\">NicolaVintageReads </a>brings us an image to consider from Alexandra Fuller\u2019s new memoir Travel Light, Move Fast:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2018Hippos often come up to the lawn in front of the pub to graze at night; in any case, they\u2019d dispensed with the need for a mower. \u2018Careful not to walk up a hippos\u2019s arse in the dark\u2019, Dad always warned if I left my barstool to venture into the pub\u2019s ablution block.\u2019<br><br>You may have read Fuller\u2019s earlier books, my favourite of which is Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness, where she recalls coming of age in a family of white settlers in Zimbabwe in the early seventies.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. First, BlogWriter shows it\u2019s never too late to read Graham Greene: Just finished Graham Greene\u2019s The Power and the Glory, almost half a century after I first became aware of its existence. A great author, he compels you to step into his characters\u2019 shoes and live their agonies and tribulations from the inside. And then he leaves you thinking. The Perils of Perception by Bobby Duffy is a \u201cmust-read\u201d, says rgilyead: Duffy is the MD of IPSOS Mori so knows a lot about surveys of people\u2019s understanding of political issues. In this book he explores the gap between what people think and reality. Depressingly, the gap is often enormous. A typical example is on immigration. When asked what proportion of the population are immigrants, British respondents said 25% when the reality is 13%, almost half. They also thought that refugees and asylum seekers made up a third of that number when the actual figure is 10%. What is worse, when confronted with the facts, those surveyed tried to justify their ignorance or deny the statistics altogether \u2026 One of the challenges he sets is to make your own guesses at the facts before he reveals the true answers. To my shame, I often got things wrong. It certainly made me think. The Gene: An Intimate History by Siddhartha Mukherjee has impressed Tempusfugit: His Emperor of All Maladies knocked my socks off and educated me about cancer. This is doing just the same about the gene and genetics. I often look out to the stars and think \u2018How has all of this come about?\u2019 This book has me looking within and getting answers to the same question. How these singular building blocks come to work together to create such complexity is fascinating - and elegant and beautiful. Miriam Toews \u201calways brings the goods\u201d, says katcalls and Women Talking is \u201cno different\u201d: Here, the women of a Mennonite community debate whether to leave their home after finding out that a group of men in their community has been tranquilising and raping the women and children of the village. It is based on the true story of a Mennonite community in Brazil. Some sentences here hit me very close to the bone and I had to sit back and take the occasional breather. A gripping read. Richard Flanagan\u2019s The Unknown Terrorist has disturbed paulburns: An utterly bleak vision of contemporary Australia. The Doll, a pole-dancer in Sydney\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, is mistakenly identified as a terrorist after a scare about three bombs in a Sydney Sports Stadium. (In Australia you could blow up the Opera House and get away with it, but blowing up a sports stadium is just unforgivable.) A media pile on, led by a sleazy TV journalist, Richard Cody, convinces the country and the government and opposition that the Doll is a major terrorist, when all she has done is slept overnight with a young Arab, also mistakenly identified as a terrorist \u2026 what is truly disturbing about this book, set in the too-real sleaze and corruption of early 21st century Kings Cross, is that with the current overreach of Australia\u2019s terror laws, which Flanagan brilliantly exposes, it could happen to any of us. Finally, NicolaVintageReads brings us an image to consider from Alexandra Fuller\u2019s new memoir Travel Light, Move Fast: \u2018Hippos often come up to the lawn in front of the pub to graze at night; in any case, they\u2019d dispensed with the need for a mower. \u2018Careful not to walk up a hippos\u2019s arse in the dark\u2019, Dad always warned if I left my barstool to venture into the pub\u2019s ablution block.\u2019 You may have read Fuller\u2019s earlier books, my favourite of which is Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness, where she recalls coming of age in a family of white settlers in Zimbabwe in the early seventies. Sadly, she loses her beloved father in this volume but his presence pervades the pages. Her mother, \u201cNicola Fuller of Central Africa\u201d is still very much alive and has more than a touch of Nancy Mitford about her. Fuller is unsentimental and often amusing about a tough life and her love of the country she grew up in. Interesting links about books and reading \u201cTo me, a proper dictionary is a book of spells,\u201d says Jeanette Winterson. The 10 writers who have just won MacArthur genius grants. Jerome Boyd Maunsell considers Susan Sontag\u2019s Duet for Cannibals, 50 years on. On the best small library in the United States. When William Burroughs met Francis Bacon.

The showrunners have to be calling the shots. They have to be. Because The Politician is a comedy-drama about a high school student (who looks about 30) who spends his entire life meticulously planning his goal of becoming president (in an age where the actual president just sort of lucked into it as a dare) that lurches from rapid-fire banter to sledgehammer sincerity without warning and feels so mannered and inhuman that you suspect that its own opening titles (where the lead character is carved from wood) were made as a sly piece of self-parody.

It revolves around Payton Hobart; a boy who, since the age of seven, has been laser-focused on becoming the president of America. There might be a great, broad, Doogie Howserish sitcom in that premise, but Murphy has bigger plans for it than that. This series is a great big wall, dripping with ideas that have been flung at it without thought. It\u2019s a Rushmore-style satire framed in camp. It\u2019s a State of America Today declaration that feels like a particularly expensive daytime soap opera. It\u2019s an exploration of privilege that\u2019s deeply enamoured with its own privilege.

For example, had Ben Platt played Andrew Cunanan in that show, with the same overcommitted sincerity and the same empty smile, then he would have been utterly fantastic. But here, with all those traits played for laughs to some degree, he grates unbearably. At times it feels like you\u2019ve crossed into a parallel universe where Will from The Inbetweeners is allowed to make prestige drama.

The season one finale effectively doubles as a pilot for season two; in it, Hobart is older and less obnoxiously precocious, fighting a battle with higher stakes than a school election, and there\u2019s a new cast that includes Judith Light and Bette Midler.

Until now, you\u2019ve always got the sense that each project has reflected a distinct side of Murphy\u2019s personality. But with The Politician it feels like all those tones have been blended into one, and the results are murkier and much less distinct than we\u2019re used to seeing. Like its creator, The Politician is overworked and distracted. A little more focus would pay off in spades.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A group of villagers living on the edge of one of Germany\u2019s biggest surface coalmines have vowed not sell their properties to the energy company RWE, and to mount a legal challenge against any attempt to oust them from their homes. The protest alliance is the first coordinated effort in more than 10 years against the expansion of the Garzweiler mine in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which threatens the existence of 12 villages that are home to 7,600 residents. Demolition of the first four villages is scheduled to begin in 2023. Acting under the name Menschenrecht vor Bergrecht \u2013 Human Rights Before Mining Rights \u2013 the alliance of villagers announced at a press conference in D\u00fcsseldorf on Monday they would refuse an expropriation agreement with RWE under which the energy company would pay to resettle them. This would mean the company would have to apply to the regional government for formal permission to dispossess the residents. But the villagers said they would then challenge this in court. In 2008, the environmental group BUND mounted a similar challenge against RWE, when it refused to sell an orchard in the village of Otzenrath on the edge of the surface mine. Protesters were eventually evicted and 87 fruit trees razed. Menschenrecht vor Bergrecht hopes it is on firmer legal ground to resist dispossession now that the government has announced plans to phase out coal by 2038 in a move away from fossil fuels. A piece of land on the boundary between the village of Keyenberg and the Garzweiler mine will serve as a testing ground. \u201cWe are using this land as an example, to ask the courts about the legal questions of expropriation,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cIf RWE does not agree we can keep this piece of land, we will use legal means to defend it. At the moment, this is the only way we can get legal clarity about our future and on whether what RWE is doing is legal \u2013 turning people out of their homes for coal, as the world struggles to combat the climate crisis.\u201d A report by the German Institute for Economic Research published this year argues that the government\u2019s new policy objectives render unnecessary RWE\u2019s plans to remove the villages around Garzweiler, as well as the forest by the Hambach surface mine. RWE says it considers the study \u201cunserious and unscientific\u201d. Asked about the villagers\u2019 declaration, a spokesperson for RWE told the Guardian the group represented a minority of residents of the villages affected. \u201cThree-quarters of villagers have concluded negotiations over compensation payments, and their villages will be rebuilt in new locations,\u201d said Guido Steffen. \u201cWe take notice of the villagers\u2019 announcement and regret that these steps have to be taken,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have a phase-out, not a breakdown of this industry, so we need the coal under these villages.\u201d Marita Dresen, a member of Menschenrecht vor Bergrecht from the village of Kuckum, said at the press conference on Monday: \u201cIt breaks my heart when I think about the fact that my entire life could be destroyed by a coal digger. \u201cThe legal route is not what we would have chosen, but it seems we have no other option if we\u2019re to get clarity. But I would never have taken this step alone. We are a team and we know that we are not just acting for our villages, but taking a stand against coal everywhere \u2013 and for the climate.\u201d",

They puke. They see each other retching and are pleased. They encourage each other to break through boundaries and inhibitions. They deliberately put on weight. They become \u201cliving art projects\u201d.</p> <p>As I describe it there, Supper Club sounds like a gimmick: an easy way into discussions about female bodies and the invisible boundaries they are expected never to transgress, as well as the very visible demarcation of a wider waistband. But this novel is anything but pat or obvious, for Williams has more than enough wit, sincerity and daring to style out any accusations of tricksiness. She\u2019s the real thing.</p> <p>Williams\u2019 prose has a few rough edges, and she recycles a few phrases and ideas; her narrator, Roberta, often feels variations of emotion unravelling in her chest, for instance. But any unsatisfactory moments are easily outnumbered by fine passages of vivid, earthy description, sharp comedy and acute observation. She has the ability to turn something as humdrum as waiting for a selfish man to tease out his overlong order in a coffee shop into a maelstrom of anxiety and tension \u2013 not to mention comedy. \u201cOne lady bumped into me and I apologised to her,\u201d she writes. \u201cShe apologised to me. But I apologised again, out-apologising her, as a kind of reverence.\u201d</p> <p>The prose can be delightful. \u201cHe was the sort of boy teenage girls vandalise their desks for,\u201d we are told at one point. In one office scene, Roberta notes: \u201cEveryone had an Apple Mac with two monitors, their eyes darting from one screen to the other. I sometimes wondered about the space between the screens. Did they ever look into that, and if so, what did they see?\u201d</p> <p>Roberta\u2019s unusual mind is left bored by her job as a stylist\u2019s assistant (\u201cI once spent three hours looking at photographs of wrists: determining which wrist was the most appropriate for displaying our new lines of bangles.\u201d) Seeking more excitement, she teams up with co-worker and best friend Stevie to form the supper club.</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cDo you want to work at that website forever?\u201d Stevie asks.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I want to label footwear and reorganise cupboards of bras,\u201d says Roberta. \u201cIt\u2019s my heart\u2019s song.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, I was roaring. The humour becomes even more effective when a shadow spreads over the book. We learn, in a dual narrative going back 10 years into Roberta\u2019s past, that our narrator was raped at university. (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/books/review/lara-williams-supper-club.html\">As one reviewer has already observed</a>, that would be a spoiler \u201cin a better world\u201d.) Here, Williams\u2019 ability to plunge us into the moment takes on a disturbing and sorrowful power. \u201cI wondered whether I should be making a sound, some husky moan or breath gasp, some indication of desire,\u201d writes the narrator as she woozily begins to work out that she has been violated as she slept, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t have any. I don\u2019t want this, I thought; or rather, the thought emerged. <em>I don\u2019t want this</em>.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps true that these experiences feel familiar, with #MeToo and a misogynist in the White House. But Williams makes the politics feel every bit as urgent as they should. Knowledge of the outrage Roberta has suffered helps us understand her friendship with Stevie, how exhilarating and liberating it can be. It also makes us fear for her when their relationship becomes claustrophobic, and the transgressions Stevie encourages begin to feel like intrusions into Roberta\u2019s personal space. Similarly, the bond she begins to form with an old university friend called Adnan feels all the more tender and special, but also precarious.</p> <p>In among all this humane and effortlessly convincing material, the actual supper clubs can start to feel over-strained. The ideas about weight gain never quite work, because the clubs don\u2019t happen often enough to make a physical difference. The sense that these evenings might be fun disappears into a hollow playacting of liberation and debauchery. But this all eventually feels right: the clubs begin to fail Roberta just as much as the reader. They no longer fill the void in her life; by the end, you\u2019re left wondering if anything can. This uncertainty just adds to the impact of this strange and impressive novel. It\u2019s the best on this year\u2019s shortlist.</p> <p>Or at least, that\u2019s my opinion.

Did they ever look into that, and if so, what did they see?\u201d Roberta\u2019s unusual mind is left bored by her job as a stylist\u2019s assistant (\u201cI once spent three hours looking at photographs of wrists: determining which wrist was the most appropriate for displaying our new lines of bangles.\u201d) Seeking more excitement, she teams up with co-worker and best friend Stevie to form the supper club. \u201cDo you want to work at that website forever?\u201d Stevie asks. \u201cYes, I want to label footwear and reorganise cupboards of bras,\u201d says Roberta. \u201cIt\u2019s my heart\u2019s song.\u201d Well, I was roaring. The humour becomes even more effective when a shadow spreads over the book. We learn, in a dual narrative going back 10 years into Roberta\u2019s past, that our narrator was raped at university. (As one reviewer has already observed, that would be a spoiler \u201cin a better world\u201d.) Here, Williams\u2019 ability to plunge us into the moment takes on a disturbing and sorrowful power. \u201cI wondered whether I should be making a sound, some husky moan or breath gasp, some indication of desire,\u201d writes the narrator as she woozily begins to work out that she has been violated as she slept, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t have any. I don\u2019t want this, I thought; or rather, the thought emerged. I don\u2019t want this.\u201d It\u2019s perhaps true that these experiences feel familiar, with #MeToo and a misogynist in the White House. But Williams makes the politics feel every bit as urgent as they should. Knowledge of the outrage Roberta has suffered helps us understand her friendship with Stevie, how exhilarating and liberating it can be. It also makes us fear for her when their relationship becomes claustrophobic, and the transgressions Stevie encourages begin to feel like intrusions into Roberta\u2019s personal space. Similarly, the bond she begins to form with an old university friend called Adnan feels all the more tender and special, but also precarious. In among all this humane and effortlessly convincing material, the actual supper clubs can start to feel over-strained. The ideas about weight gain never quite work, because the clubs don\u2019t happen often enough to make a physical difference. The sense that these evenings might be fun disappears into a hollow playacting of liberation and debauchery. But this all eventually feels right: the clubs begin to fail Roberta just as much as the reader. They no longer fill the void in her life; by the end, you\u2019re left wondering if anything can. This uncertainty just adds to the impact of this strange and impressive novel. It\u2019s the best on this year\u2019s shortlist. Or at least, that\u2019s my opinion.

      "bodyText": "Pakistan\u2019s government is facing an embarrassing high court case after allegedly failing to pay a multimillion-pound bill for tracking down properties once owned by the country\u2019s disgraced former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. The asset recovery firm Broadsheet has launched an unusual claim for about \u00a317m against the country and its anti-corruption agency, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). It plans to apply to take possession of Avenfield apartments, four luxury flats in Park Lane, central London, which were the homes of Sharif\u2019s family in the capital. Sharif is appealing against his conviction for corruption from an Islamabad jail. He was jailed for seven years in December last year on corruption charges. The apartments, in a block next to Hyde Park on the edge of Mayfair, were used to raise a \u00a37m mortgage and would probably be worth more than \u00a38m today. The corruption case highlighted the ease with which London\u2019s property market could be used to move money from abroad. Stuart Newberger, a senior partner at the Washington-based law firm Crowell and Moring, which represents Broadsheet, said the high court had previously ruled in a private hearing that Pakistan owed his client about $22m for helping help locate and repatriate the corrupt assets of Sharif. \u201cPakistan has refused to comply with this final non-appealable court decision, thus requiring Broadsheet to enforce this order by seizing Pakistan\u2019s assets,\u201d he said. Documents before the high court state Sir Anthony Evans QC ruled in December the Pakistani government and the NAB owed Broadsheet $21.5m. Evans also upheld Broadsheet\u2019s reading of the asset recovery agreement as entitling it to 20% of any assets recovered from the targets, regardless of whether the assets were located in Pakistan or abroad. General Pervez Musharraf established the NAB in 1999 to investigate corruption allegations against public officials, in the wake of a military coup that deposed Sharif, forcing him to flee the country. Broadsheet, registered in the Isle of Man, entered into the agreement with the NAB in the following year, in which it agreed to help track down the assets of Sharif and more than 200 other politicians, officials and their families. This work was done at the firm\u2019s expense in return for 20% of any sums recovered from the designated targets. The NAB terminated the agreement in 2003 but Broadsheet\u2019s owner, the Iranian-born Oxford academic Kaveh Moussavi, said he later learned the NAB had secretly entered into settlements with Sharif and other targets. The company said the agreement entitled it to a commission on any settlement with the targets, even if Broadsheet was not involved in procuring them. After seven years of exile in Saudi Arabia, Sharif returned to Pakistan during the arbitration and was elected for a third term as prime minister in 2013. Pakistan\u2019s supreme court subsequently disqualified him from public office in July 2017 after incriminating information on Sharif, first brought to light by the Panama Papers, the huge leak of data from law firm Mossack Fonseca in 2015 that shed light on the ownership of thousands of companies in secretive tax havens. The leaks linked Sharif\u2019s children to the purchase of London properties through offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands in the mid-1990s. At that time the children were minors, and the purchases was assumed to have been made by Sharif. Pakistan authorities accused Sharif of using a complex series of transactions and shell companies to funnel the proceeds of public funds embezzled at home into assets abroad. The court ruled in April last year that his disqualification should be for life. Sharif still faces multiple criminal proceedings. In July 2018 an accountability court convicted him, his daughter Maryam and son-in-law Safdar Awan of corruption relating to the acquisition of flats at Avenfield. Sharif and Maryam were arrested on 13 July after landing in Lahore. Maryam\u2019s sentence was suspended by a court in Islamabad. They deny wrongdoing. Investigations into Sharif were part of a campaign against corruption promised by Imran Khan, the former cricket star turned politician who was elected prime minister in July.

      "body": "<p>\u201c<em>Der FC Schalke wird Deutscher Meister</em>,\u201d came the chant from the away section at Red Bull Arena \u2013 \u201cSchalke are going to be champions of Germany\u201d \u2013 a refrain that one can only imagine would have been delivered with ladles of sarcasm at the back end of a thrashing through most of last season. The mood of fatalism, lingering from the last campaign, was still detectable in the first few weeks of this new one, with memories fresh and the football not yet inspiring under the new stewardship of a familiar face, David Wagner.</p> \n<p>So, even if the faithful are not entirely serious, the delirium of Saturday afternoon in Leipzig was perfectly understandable as a dynamic away team led by a renewed Amine Harit \u2013 a player who is their new start in microcosm \u2013 cut through one of the early title favourites. When Harit strode clear and played in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/28/manchester-city-rabbi-matondo-schalke-12m\">Welsh teenager Rabbi Matondo</a> to apply an emphatic finish on his first Bundesliga start of the season, signing and sealing the game at 3-0, it was difficult to fully absorb.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/30/mario-balotelli-melts-hearts-scoring-return-naples-brescia\">Mario Balotelli melts hearts on his scoring return to Naples with Brescia | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe word \u2018proud\u2019 was invented for days like today,\u201d beamed Wagner after the game, a fourth straight Bundesliga win that catapulted his team into the top four, even above their lightly faltering rivals Borussia Dortmund. The previous three victories had been needed, and were welcome. This was different. It really was one to be savoured.</p> \n<p>It had been a difficult scenario to envisage, even when the game got underway. Leipzig had their chances, with Marcel Sabitzer rattling the crossbar from his long-range sweet spot and visiting goalkeeper Alexander N\u00fcbel making a couple of important stops. \u201cAlex kept us in the game by keeping out the first two big opportunities for Leipzig,\u201d noted Wagner after the game.</p> \n<p>By the time N\u00fcbel made his first slip, seemingly in two minds whether to catch or just parry Emil Forsberg\u2019s long-ranger - eventually doing neither as the shot flew in \u2013 the clock was running down and the visitors were already three goals to the good, and it didn\u2019t matter nearly as much as it might have.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6bf740924342e5e285e3501d16c04676d25ba758\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bf740924342e5e285e3501d16c04676d25ba758/0_3_4070_2443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rabbi Matondo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rabbi Matondo scored for Schalke after being deployed as a striker instead of a winger.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixathlon/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI decided too early that I wanted to fist the ball out,\u201d said N\u00fcbel. \u201cThat was my mistake.\u201d Wagner and the sporting director Jochen Schneider\u2019s praise may have made him feel better, as did the travelling fans, he pointed out, chanting for him after Forsberg\u2019s goal. The goalkeeper\u2019s importance is clear, but neither would it be out of place to detect a touch of charm offensive from the club, knowing that his contract runs out at the end of the season. N\u00fcbel has already rejected an approach from Leipzig, and is believed to have made known through his representatives that he isn\u2019t keen on revisiting the possibility in future.</p> \n<p>That leaves one other main exit possibility: Bayern. Yet their closing of ranks around Manuel Neuer last week, led by Uli Hoeness, was a reminder of the Germany No 1\u2019s status there. The faith that Schalke have placed in N\u00fcbel, who replaced Ralf F\u00e4hrmann as captain and \u2019keeper before the latter was packed off on loan to Norwich, is total.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What Schalke can best do to avoid another future icon following the well-trodden path out the door following the exits of Leon Goreztka, Max Meyer, Joel Matip for free is to establish a winning culture. N\u00fcbel is key to that but so is Harit. A side that struggled to score or even create in the first few games of the season has their playmaker to thank for joining the dots in the final third.</p> \n<p>It has been a tough past year for Harit. Involved in a fatal car accident in Morocco during the summer of 2018 after his return from the World Cup, he visibly (and by his own admission) struggled to get past it, and he delivered an underwhelming 2018-19 after a promising debut campaign. Wagner appears to have helped him move on and get back towards fulfilling his considerable potential. He won and scored the penalty that made it 2-0 in the first half in Leipzig before creating Matondo\u2019s clincher.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a very, very good Bundesliga player,\u201d Nagelsmann had warned before the game. \u201cDavid has put him back on track.\u201d The Leipzig coach also said he had a special plan in mind to deal with Harit \u2013 a huge compliment in itself \u2013 but whatever it was, his team struggled to action it here as they gave up their unbeaten start.</p> \n<p>Wagner giving Harit a role in the centre of the field has contributed to his success, just as his surprise deployment of Matondo, the former Manchester City winger, as a striker alongside Guido Burgstaller, did. Optimism abounds. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say that we\u2019re a top team if we can continue to bring performances of this level,\u201d Harit boldly stated. That, as always, remains the challenge for Schalke.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1177987317530857472\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As cool as you like from Rabbi Matondo \ud83d\ude0e<br><br>The former Man City starlet slots home his first senior goal!<br><br>Another British player doing his thing in the Bundesliga. <a href=\"https://t.co/zKHiT8IQep\">pic.twitter.com/zKHiT8IQep</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1177987317530857472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 28, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 It was a tale of two afternoon naps for Bayern and Dortmund \u2013 one proving costly, the other going unpunished. The champions escaped minnows Paderborn with a 3-2 win, despite lackadaisical play that included Robert Lewandowski missing an open goal and Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara coming with a whisker of scoring an own goal when back-passing blind from the centre circle. BVB, meanwhile, recovered from conceding an early goal at home to Werder Bremen to lead, only to let their superiority drift \u2013 as last week in Frankfurt \u2013 and let in a cheap set-piece equaliser to concede another 2-2 draw. Lucien Favre \u2013 who might be under pressure for the first time \u2013 lamented that \u201cwe didn\u2019t control the game. We sometimes played a bit too hastily\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Freiburg sit third after coming from behind to win at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, Gian-Luca Waldschmidt coming off the bench to score a typically stylish winner. With attacking options in abundance, Christian Streich\u2019s side will provide a real challenge for Dortmund next weekend.</p> \n<p>\u2022 After breaking his Bundesliga duck and engineering last week\u2019s win against Fortuna, Marcus Thuram was at it again this Saturday, putting the opener on a plate for Alessane Pl\u00e9a and scoring the second himself in Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s 3-0 win at Hoffenheim. Nagelsmann\u2019s successor, Alfred Schreuder, is already under the microscope.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The kings are dead, long live the kings. Eintracht Frankfurt looks very different after being shorn of their fantastic front three from last term but their new strike duo of Bas Dost and Andr\u00e9 Silva were both on the mark in a more-comfortable-than-it-looks-on-paper 2-1 win at Union Berlin \u2013 their first away points of the season.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The late game on Sunday turned into a bleak end to the weekend for K\u00f6ln, against Hertha, who barely looked capable of crossing the halfway line until Javair\u00f4 Dilrosun scored a cracker for a second straight week. Ante \u010covi\u0107\u2019s side eventually ran out 4-0 winners, with the substitute Vedad Ibi\u0161evi\u0107 scoring two. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

      "bodyText": "\u201cDer FC Schalke wird Deutscher Meister,\u201d came the chant from the away section at Red Bull Arena \u2013 \u201cSchalke are going to be champions of Germany\u201d \u2013 a refrain that one can only imagine would have been delivered with ladles of sarcasm at the back end of a thrashing through most of last season. The mood of fatalism, lingering from the last campaign, was still detectable in the first few weeks of this new one, with memories fresh and the football not yet inspiring under the new stewardship of a familiar face, David Wagner. So, even if the faithful are not entirely serious, the delirium of Saturday afternoon in Leipzig was perfectly understandable as a dynamic away team led by a renewed Amine Harit \u2013 a player who is their new start in microcosm \u2013 cut through one of the early title favourites. When Harit strode clear and played in the Welsh teenager Rabbi Matondo to apply an emphatic finish on his first Bundesliga start of the season, signing and sealing the game at 3-0, it was difficult to fully absorb. \u201cThe word \u2018proud\u2019 was invented for days like today,\u201d beamed Wagner after the game, a fourth straight Bundesliga win that catapulted his team into the top four, even above their lightly faltering rivals Borussia Dortmund. The previous three victories had been needed, and were welcome. This was different. It really was one to be savoured. It had been a difficult scenario to envisage, even when the game got underway. Leipzig had their chances, with Marcel Sabitzer rattling the crossbar from his long-range sweet spot and visiting goalkeeper Alexander N\u00fcbel making a couple of important stops. \u201cAlex kept us in the game by keeping out the first two big opportunities for Leipzig,\u201d noted Wagner after the game. By the time N\u00fcbel made his first slip, seemingly in two minds whether to catch or just parry Emil Forsberg\u2019s long-ranger - eventually doing neither as the shot flew in \u2013 the clock was running down and the visitors were already three goals to the good, and it didn\u2019t matter nearly as much as it might have. \u201cI decided too early that I wanted to fist the ball out,\u201d said N\u00fcbel. \u201cThat was my mistake.\u201d Wagner and the sporting director Jochen Schneider\u2019s praise may have made him feel better, as did the travelling fans, he pointed out, chanting for him after Forsberg\u2019s goal. The goalkeeper\u2019s importance is clear, but neither would it be out of place to detect a touch of charm offensive from the club, knowing that his contract runs out at the end of the season. N\u00fcbel has already rejected an approach from Leipzig, and is believed to have made known through his representatives that he isn\u2019t keen on revisiting the possibility in future. That leaves one other main exit possibility: Bayern. Yet their closing of ranks around Manuel Neuer last week, led by Uli Hoeness, was a reminder of the Germany No 1\u2019s status there. The faith that Schalke have placed in N\u00fcbel, who replaced Ralf F\u00e4hrmann as captain and \u2019keeper before the latter was packed off on loan to Norwich, is total. What Schalke can best do to avoid another future icon following the well-trodden path out the door following the exits of Leon Goreztka, Max Meyer, Joel Matip for free is to establish a winning culture. N\u00fcbel is key to that but so is Harit. A side that struggled to score or even create in the first few games of the season has their playmaker to thank for joining the dots in the final third. It has been a tough past year for Harit. Involved in a fatal car accident in Morocco during the summer of 2018 after his return from the World Cup, he visibly (and by his own admission) struggled to get past it, and he delivered an underwhelming 2018-19 after a promising debut campaign. Wagner appears to have helped him move on and get back towards fulfilling his considerable potential. He won and scored the penalty that made it 2-0 in the first half in Leipzig before creating Matondo\u2019s clincher. \u201cThis is a very, very good Bundesliga player,\u201d Nagelsmann had warned before the game. \u201cDavid has put him back on track.\u201d The Leipzig coach also said he had a special plan in mind to deal with Harit \u2013 a huge compliment in itself \u2013 but whatever it was, his team struggled to action it here as they gave up their unbeaten start. Wagner giving Harit a role in the centre of the field has contributed to his success, just as his surprise deployment of Matondo, the former Manchester City winger, as a striker alongside Guido Burgstaller, did. Optimism abounds. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say that we\u2019re a top team if we can continue to bring performances of this level,\u201d Harit boldly stated. That, as always, remains the challenge for Schalke. Talking points \u2022 It was a tale of two afternoon naps for Bayern and Dortmund \u2013 one proving costly, the other going unpunished. The champions escaped minnows Paderborn with a 3-2 win, despite lackadaisical play that included Robert Lewandowski missing an open goal and Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara coming with a whisker of scoring an own goal when back-passing blind from the centre circle. BVB, meanwhile, recovered from conceding an early goal at home to Werder Bremen to lead, only to let their superiority drift \u2013 as last week in Frankfurt \u2013 and let in a cheap set-piece equaliser to concede another 2-2 draw. Lucien Favre \u2013 who might be under pressure for the first time \u2013 lamented that \u201cwe didn\u2019t control the game. We sometimes played a bit too hastily\u201d. \u2022 Freiburg sit third after coming from behind to win at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, Gian-Luca Waldschmidt coming off the bench to score a typically stylish winner. With attacking options in abundance, Christian Streich\u2019s side will provide a real challenge for Dortmund next weekend. \u2022 After breaking his Bundesliga duck and engineering last week\u2019s win against Fortuna, Marcus Thuram was at it again this Saturday, putting the opener on a plate for Alessane Pl\u00e9a and scoring the second himself in Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s 3-0 win at Hoffenheim. Nagelsmann\u2019s successor, Alfred Schreuder, is already under the microscope. \u2022 The kings are dead, long live the kings. Eintracht Frankfurt looks very different after being shorn of their fantastic front three from last term but their new strike duo of Bas Dost and Andr\u00e9 Silva were both on the mark in a more-comfortable-than-it-looks-on-paper 2-1 win at Union Berlin \u2013 their first away points of the season. \u2022 The late game on Sunday turned into a bleak end to the weekend for K\u00f6ln, against Hertha, who barely looked capable of crossing the halfway line until Javair\u00f4 Dilrosun scored a cracker for a second straight week. Ante \u010covi\u0107\u2019s side eventually ran out 4-0 winners, with the substitute Vedad Ibi\u0161evi\u0107 scoring two.",

      "bodyText": "World leaders have joined mourners in Paris to pay their final respects to the former French president Jacques Chirac. A series of private and national ceremonies were being held during a national day of mourning for the charismatic and popular former leader, who died last Thursday aged 86. After a mass attended by about 200 family and friends at the H\u00f4tel des Invalides, the current president, Emmanuel Macron, led a military tribute. Chirac\u2019s coffin was then driven to the Church of Saint-Sulpice, where pianist Daniel Barenboim played a Schubert impromptu at a memorial service attended by dozens of French politicians and foreign officials. A private family church service for Chirac was celebrated prior to the military tribute and a private funeral was due to take place later on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the capital. Macron entered Les Invalides at 10.45am to review French troops as the Marseillaise was played. To a solemn drumbeat, Chirac\u2019s coffin, draped in a tricolour, was brought into the cour d\u2019honneur and placed on the ground. The atmosphere was sombre and silent. Several military veterans present could be seen wiping their eyes as the funeral march was played.After a minute\u2019s silence, Macron followed the coffin out of Les Invalides. The death of Chirac, who was president of France from 1995 to 2007, prompted a flood of tributes to a man whose political career spanned more than four decades and who was seen as one of France\u2019s last great statespeople. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was among 30 world leaders who flew to Paris to attend the funeral. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, also attended, as as did former leaders who worked with Chirac, including Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European commission, and the former US president Bill Clinton. French politicians turned out en masse, including three former presidents \u2013 93-year-old Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, Chirac\u2019s successor, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the former Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Before the military ceremony, Chirac\u2019s widow, Bernadette, 86, attended a private mass at the Saint-Louis-des-Invalides cathedral. The couple were married for 63 years and had two daughters, Laurence, who died in 2016, and Claude. Chirac will be buried next to his elder daughter, who had anorexia for most of her adult life and died at the age of 58. Chirac\u2019s only grandchild, Martin Chirac-Rey, 23, addressed about 200 family and friends after the private service. The Elys\u00e9e Palace had declared a day of national mourning and the tricolour over Les Invalides flew at half-mast, as it did across France. A minute\u2019s silence was observed in public institutions and schools. Although Chirac has been accused of achieving little during his 12 years in the Elys\u00e9e and was later convicted for his role in a \u201cfake jobs\u201d scandal during his time as mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995, a poll by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper showed the French consider him their best president of the modern era, alongside the country\u2019s postwar leader, Charles de Gaulle. His two main achievements were being the first French leader to publicly recognise France\u2019s role in the deportation of Jews during the Nazi occupation of the country during the second world war, and opposing the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. Chirac was also known for his bonhomie and reputation as a bon vivant, with a gargantuan appetite for traditional food washed down with a few beers. The H\u00f4tel des Invalides is, as its name suggests, a former military hospital and retirement home for veterans. It is the site of museums and monuments to France\u2019s military history and contains the tombs of its war heroes, including the former emperor Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte. On Sunday, thousands of people turned up at Les Invalides, where Chirac\u2019s coffin lay in state, to pay their respects. Many left flowers and apples, his favourite fruit. The tributes will continue during the week, when the French team don black armbands for their Rugby World Cup match with the US in the Japanese city of Fukuoka.",

Because this is a match that Scotland, humbled by the Irish in their first outing of the World Cup, cannot afford to lose. Do so and one of Japan and Samoa, who meet in their next match, would certainly be out of reach and Ireland, despite their own defeat to Japan, would swiftly follow them. \u201cWe watched the Japan game, we\u2019ve done the numbers and we know the ramifications,\u201d says Scotland\u2019s captain, Stuart McInally.</p> \n  <p>Gregor Townsend makes five changes to the team that lost to Ireland. \u201cThe reality is we now have to win our next three games to make it out of our pool, so the knockout stages for us begin this Monday night,\u201d he says. This is the first do-or-die, win-or-bust game of the World Cup, and it should be a cracker. Here are the teams:</p> \n  <p><strong>Scotland: </strong>Stuart Hogg, Darcy Graham, Chris Harris, Sam Johnson, Sean Maitland, Finn Russell, Greig Laidlaw, Blade Thomson, Jamie Ritchie, Magnus Bradbury, Jonny Gray, Grant Gilchrist, Willem Nel, Stuart McInally (capt), Allan Dell. <br><strong>Replacements:</strong> Fraser Brown, Gordon Reid, Zander Fagerson, Scott Cummings, Ryan Wilson, George Horne, Adam Hastings, Duncan Taylor. <br> <strong>Samoa:</strong> Tim Nanai-Williams, Belgium Tuatagaloa, Alapati Leiua, Henry Taefu, Ed Fidow, Tusi Pisi, Melani Matavao, Jack Lam (capt), TJ Ioane, Chris Vui, Kane Le\u2019aupepe, Teofilo Paulo, Michael Alaalatoa, Ray Niuia, Logovii Mulipola. <br><strong>Replacements:</strong> Seilala Lam, Paul Alo-Emile, Jordan Lay, Piula Faasalele, Josh Tyrell, Pele Cowley, Ulupano Seuteni, Kieron Fonotia.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Right then, that\u2019ll be me. It\u2019s been a blast. Here\u2019s Andy Bull\u2019s match report, which features perhaps the finest first nine words in all history: \u201cBefore the tournament Scotland slicked their balls with shampoo\u201d. Enjoy, and bye! Before the tournament Scotland slicked their balls with shampoo to help them get ready for just the sort of the muggy conditions they found here in the insufferably humid Kobe Misaki Stadium. Turned out it worked. They were head and shoulders above Samoa, anyway, in game that felt, for long stretches, like watching 30 blokes fight over the last bar of soap in bathhouse. Neither side could hold on to the ball, at all, and the game was littered with handling errors, knock-ons, and turnovers. Scotland coped far better with it than Samoa did and in the end it was an impressive victory, 34-0, with the crucial bonus-point they needed to stay in contention for the quarter-finals. Much more here: Steve Jackson, the Samoa coach, gives his thoughts: Look, Scotland were very good tonight. You\u2019ve got to give credit where credit is due and congratulations, they fully deserved their win tonight. We\u2019re still in the pool, we\u2019re one from two, and we\u2019ve got two games to go. We just need to take all the emotion out of the week and understand that there\u2019s another team in front of you. We\u2019ll go back to the drawing board and have a look where we went wrong. But you\u2019re only as good as the opposition let you, and we played a very good Scotland side tonight. Gregor Townsend is chuffed: I think we tried to build on what we did in the first half. The first half was excellent in terms of how we defended, the pressure we built through our kicking game and also the set piece. Second half we didn\u2019t start as well but the pressure told in the end and I was really impressed with the work ethic of the team. I think we would have been disappointed if we hadn\u2019t picked up the bonus point. ITV clearly aren\u2019t impressed with that pitchside interview, as they leave it with the Scotland coach still mid-flow. Stuart McInally has a quick chat: It was important that we had a reaction after last week. We\u2019ve always had really tough games against Samoa so I was really happy with the performance. We played a lot of rugby in their half, and the fact we managed to get that fourth try at the end is going to be important. Scotland have two more Pool A fixtures, against Russia on 9 October and against Japan in Yokohama on the 13th, which could well be a winner-takes-all shoot-out. 82 mins: It\u2019s tapped and booted into touch, and Scotland are on the board with five points, and back in the World Cup mix! 82 mins: Scotland win a penalty, and that\u2019s surely the end of it! 81 mins: The gong sounds, with Samoa still pushing for their first points of the match. They have the ball, five yards from the line. 79 mins: Scotland\u2019s Jonny Gray is named player of the match. Their forwards have been excellent as a group. 79 mins: Into the final few minutes, and Samoa have a line-out on Scotland\u2019s five-yard line. They throw it straight to Brown. 77 mins: Fraser Brown bursts through the defensive line, but his pass infield to George Horne, who would have run clear to the line, is intercepted by Nanai-Williams! 76 mins: Adam Hastings, son of Gavin, replaces Finn Russell. They are, we\u2019re told, the first father and son to both play for Scotland at a World Cup. 75 mins: Fidow got nowhere near the ball, he just dived over and on top of his opponent, who lost control of the ball only because he got a knee in the shoulder. That\u2019s Fidow\u2019s second yellow card, and that means a red! Scotland have a fourth try, they have their bonus point, and their opponents are down to 14 men 74 mins: Scotland steal the ball on halfway, and Sean Maitland is released on the left and goes for the corner! He dives a bit early, though, and he is pushed into touch, and the ball flicked out of his hands, by the sliding Fidow before he crosses the line. Was that a genuine tackle, though? 73 mins: Ryan Wilson comes on for Magnus Bradbury, as Samoa try to kick the ball into touch and miss! It goes dead, and Scotland can kick clear. 72 mins: Samoa have the ball and are pushing in Scotland\u2019s 22, with a penalty up their sleeve. 71 mins: Another change: Pele Cowley comes on for Melani Matavao. 70 mins: Ten minutes to go, and Samoa still have nil points. This has been an excellent defensive performance from Scotland, though Samoa could surely have kicked a couple of penalties had they not decided to seek tries instead. 66 mins: Samoa bring Josh Tyrell, briefly on the field in the first half, back on again in place of TJ Ioane. 65 mins: The crowd suddenly roar, though their excitement was prompted by a streaker rather than the rugby. 63 mins: They get the ball within a couple of feet of the line, but the ball is kicked out of their hands by a player on the ground as they dive for the try. It should be a penalty, but it\u2019s not spotted. 61 mins: A calamitous line-out for Samoa, who go long, miss everyone and as it bounces to Magnus Bradbury they\u2019re under pressure once again! 58 mins: Scotland bring Zander Fagerson on for Allan Dell as the hunt for a bonus point intensified. 57 mins: Ed Fidow was offside, did prevent a try, and is yellow-carded as Scotland move further ahead! 57 mins: It wasn\u2019t touched down, but was Fidow offside there as he dived in to stop it? And if so, is it a penalty try? 57 mins: From the line-out Scotland keep the ball in the maul, push over the line and down it goes, but there are bodies everywhere and the referee has no idea if it\u2019s a try or not. 56 mins: Scotland have had six second-half penalties. Samoa\u2019s defensive line is standing firm, but they\u2019re not always respecting the rules. 55 mins: Samoa, still under pressure, bring Seilala Lam on for Niula, and Ulupano Seuteni on for Pisi, and concede another penalty deep inside their 22. 54 mins: They move the ball right, but Russell\u2019s pass to Graham is a bit high and flies through his team-mates hands, with the line gaping! 53 mins: Samoa spin the scrum and concede a penalty for not pushing straight. Scotland take another scrum, just beyond the five-yard line. 52 mins: Scotland fumble, but Samoa concede a penalty for a dangerous tackle on Gilchrist. The Scots bring on Fraser Brown for Stuart McInally. 50 mins: Now Piula Faasalele comes on, replacing Filo Paulo. Scotland get a penalty for an offside, and they too want tries as they pursue a bonus point and thus kick to touch. 48 mins: Samoa put pressure on Scotland, but then pass the ball to space rather than to a player, and Scotland snaffle it. 48 mins: Paul Alo-Emile eplaces Michael Alaalatoa for Samoa. 47 mins: From a line-out Samoa keep the ball in the maul for a while, though they seem mainly to be moving sideways. Samoa eventually get a penalty, and though it\u2019s kickable they need tries, so go for touch. 45 mins: Samoa bring Kieron Fonotia on for Belgium Tuatagaloa. Advance warning: I might not keep entirely on top of all second-half replacements, but I\u2019ll do my best. 43 mins: Samoa put Scotland under pressure with a long kick that bounces awkwardly, but a high tackle allows the Scots to clear. 41 mins: And they\u2019re away! The players are back out and ready for more. Hold on tight... Apart perhaps for a third try Scotland could have asked for little more from that half. Samoa haven\u2019t had the slightest sniff, while Scotland have played intelligently and kicked brilliantly. Samoa were all over the place towards the end of the half, and have some work to do repairing their spirit ahead of half two. And that\u2019s half time! Scotland are halfway to victory and two-fourths of the way to a bonus point to boot! 45 mins: It ends with a fumble from Russell, a slip from Graham and a penalty to Samoa. Nanai-Williams kicks it straight into touch, which means they have to take the line-out before the half-time whistle goes. 44 mins: They\u2019re still pushing... 42 mins: From the line-out they push to within inches of the line, but the ball gets stuck and the have another penalty. 41 mins: Scotland push again, and will end the half with a penalty deep, deep inside Samoa\u2019s half. They kick to touch, and want another try before the half is done. 39 mins: Stuart Hogg\u2019s next kick is better still, sending the ball between the posts from a distance! 37 mins: Scotland\u2019s excellent first-half display from Scotland is now fully reflected on the scoreboard, and after Hogg\u2019s excellent kick downfield and into touch, they\u2019re putting Samoa under pressure again. 36 mins: An easy job for Laidlaw! 34 mins: And another one! Ritchie passes to Laidlaw who runs forward but seems to run out of space, momentum and team-mates 10 yards from the line. Happily Tim Nanai-Williams arrives and instead of tackling just pushes him towards his goal and back into space, and leaves him with an easy final sprint! 31 mins: Laidlaw makes no mistake with the conversion, and Scotland have themselves a buffer. Fidow there, an instant before the try, showing that in these conditions legs are even more slippery than balls. 31 mins: A fantastic kick from Finn Russell finds Maitland on the left, and Ed Fidow can\u2019t stop him crossing the line! 29 mins: Scotland launch a maul that rumbles into Samoa\u2019s 22, but just as they look about to seriously threaten Jonny Gray lets the ball slip through his hands, and it\u2019s gone. 28 mins: Sean Maitland goes on a fine run down the right, before finally turning and passing the ball straight to Samoa\u2019s Matavao, who promptly fumbles straight out of play. 25 mins: Samoa bludgeon their way into Scotland\u2019s 22, but they then keep hold of the ball on the ground, and Scotland will be able to clear. 24 mins: Finn Russell fumbles now. Scotland lead 9-2 on handling errors, in horrible conditions for catching stuff. 22 mins: There is not a lot of try-threatening happening. Scotland have dominated the first quarter, but their lead is very slender. 20 mins: Scotland spend a couple of minutes with the ball, working it about and running into Samoans without ever progressing. 18 mins: After Harris\u2019s kick Samoa have the ball a few yards from their line. Given the way the ball is behaving, this is a perilous position, so they kick it away. 15 mins: Jamie Ritchie steals the ball as it skews out the side of a ruck, but it immediately slips out of his grasp again. The thing seems to be made of soap. 13 mins: A massive kick upfield is followed by fumbles from both Belgium Tuatagoloa and Alapati Leiua, and a Samoa scrum well inside their half. Lam returns to the fray, Tyrell going off again. 11 mins: The ball, clearly already greasy with sweat or fitted with a jack-in-the-box mechanism, pops out of Sean Maitland\u2019s arms, leading to a Samoa penalty. It\u2019s well inside their own half, but at least allows them to leave it. 9 mins: Laidlaw makes no mistake, and Scotland get some points on the board! 8 mins: After a great little burst from Magnus Bradbury, Scotland win the game\u2019s first penalty, within kicking range. Greig Laidlaw is going to have a go. 6 mins: Samoa haven\u2019t left their half since Graham\u2019s burst, as Scotland keep up the pressure. 4 mins: An early change is forced on Samoa: Jack Lam walks off the field looking groggy, and Josh Tyrell comes on. 3 mins: Scotland win it back and work it to the right wing, where Darcy Graham goes on a fine run, gaining 40 yards, and from there they keep pushing, working the ball over to the left and finally being held up a few yards from the line. 2 mins: Samoa win the ball back smartly and keep it for a while, but get absolutely nowhere against the Scottish defence. 1 min: And we\u2019re off! Samoa, in royal blue shirts and white shorts, send the ball spinning skywards and towards the Scots, in dark blue shirts and similar shorts. Samoa perform the Siva Tau, and kick-off is but moments away. The anthems have been sung, and players are already wiping sweat from their brows. The players are on their way out of the sweetly air-conditioned dressing rooms and into the humid hot-house of the beroofed stadium. And the chatty little tyke has had another one! The first was recorded, to be fair, and this one is live: It\u2019s a huge challenge given the results this week, and our game against Ireland, and Japan\u2019s against Ireland. We have to focus on winning. We know we\u2019ll have to pick up a bonus point at some stage, but the focus is to show the true version of who we are and get the win. Gregor Townsend has a chat with ITV: They can\u2019t wait to get a chance to play better, and we have to stay together. This is one game of four games in the pool, and we have bounced back before. I believe we can play much better in our next game. We know now that we\u2019ve got to win our next three games. It probably would have been the same even if we\u2019d beaten Ireland but now we\u2019ve lost and we haven\u2019t played nearly as well as we can, the reality is in front of us: we\u2019ve got to improve, and we\u2019ve got to beat Samoa, and then move on to our next game. Here\u2019s a little pre-match reading, courtesy of Andy Bull in Kobe: Kobe\u2019s Misaki Stadium is looking fine tonight, but I wonder what\u2019s being said in that there huddle. Hello world! On the plus side, Scotland have only ever lost one game to Samoa. On the down side, they won the last two meetings by the too-close-for-comfort scorelines of 44-38 and 36-33, and could do without the kind of pressure margins of that slender ilk would create in the closing minutes here. Because this is a match that Scotland, humbled by the Irish in their first outing of the World Cup, cannot afford to lose. Do so and one of Japan and Samoa, who meet in their next match, would certainly be out of reach and Ireland, despite their own defeat to Japan, would swiftly follow them. \u201cWe watched the Japan game, we\u2019ve done the numbers and we know the ramifications,\u201d says Scotland\u2019s captain, Stuart McInally. Gregor Townsend makes five changes to the team that lost to Ireland. \u201cThe reality is we now have to win our next three games to make it out of our pool, so the knockout stages for us begin this Monday night,\u201d he says. This is the first do-or-die, win-or-bust game of the World Cup, and it should be a cracker. Here are the teams: Scotland: Stuart Hogg, Darcy Graham, Chris Harris, Sam Johnson, Sean Maitland, Finn Russell, Greig Laidlaw, Blade Thomson, Jamie Ritchie, Magnus Bradbury, Jonny Gray, Grant Gilchrist, Willem Nel, Stuart McInally (capt), Allan Dell. Replacements: Fraser Brown, Gordon Reid, Zander Fagerson, Scott Cummings, Ryan Wilson, George Horne, Adam Hastings, Duncan Taylor. Samoa: Tim Nanai-Williams, Belgium Tuatagaloa, Alapati Leiua, Henry Taefu, Ed Fidow, Tusi Pisi, Melani Matavao, Jack Lam (capt), TJ Ioane, Chris Vui, Kane Le\u2019aupepe, Teofilo Paulo, Michael Alaalatoa, Ray Niuia, Logovii Mulipola. Replacements: Seilala Lam, Paul Alo-Emile, Jordan Lay, Piula Faasalele, Josh Tyrell, Pele Cowley, Ulupano Seuteni, Kieron Fonotia.",

Sebastian Kurz\u2019s conservative People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) won 37.1% of the vote, its best score since 2002, while the share held by FP\u00d6, until May his junior coalition partner in government, collapsed to 16.1%, down a full 10 percentage points. Voters deserted the FP\u00d6 after its leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, was filmed offering lucrative public contracts in exchange for campaign support to a woman claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch. But the result fits into a wider continental pattern of far-right, nationalist and populist parties facing increasingly stiff political or institutional resistance and failing to capitalise on their advances in the polls to the extent that many observers had predicted. While the social and economic discontent and the dissatisfaction with Europe\u2019s mainstream parties that fuelled their recent surge have far from vanished, the populists seem no more able than anyone else in Europe\u2019s fragmenting political landscape to secure clear majorities for their cause. In Italy, the former interior minister Matteo Salvini, of the far-right League party, is out in the cold after collapsing the government in the mistaken belief that his soaring poll ratings meant the country wanted a hard turn to the right. Instead his coalition partners, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, formed a government with the centre-left Democratic party, and while Salvini will doubtless be back, for the moment the nationalists are nursing a self-inflicted bloody nose. In elections in two crucial German regions this month, the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party made big gains and posted record scores, but it did not win in either and was shut out of power in both. In France, Emmanuel Macron seemed under serious threat earlier this year, shaken by the violent Saturday demonstrations of the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement and the advance of the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen.

Far-right and illiberal populism continues to prosper in Poland and Hungary. But elsewhere in central Europe, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, is facing some of the biggest protests since the fall of communism, and the new president of Slovakia is a progressive liberal. The underlying causes of far-right populism \u2013 rising inequality, austerity, fear of immigration, globalisation, automation \u2013 remain, and the parties they sustain are fixtures in Europe\u2019s political landscape.

A decade ago he made a personal pilgrimage to Karl Marx\u2019s tomb in Highgate, London. \u201cPatrick was a highly skilled and effective human rights investigator in one of the riskiest parts of the world. He had an incredible contact book, and liked to travel by public transport to know what ordinary people were talking about. He was charming, charismatic, selfless and courageous. Amnesty International has lost a close friend,\u201d said the human rights organisation\u2019s secretary general, Kumi Naidoo. Naagbanton received multiple death threats over the course of his career, including several in early 2011 when Amnesty, believing his life to be in danger, appealed to its supporters to write to the local police commissioner, demanding he be protected. Unlike some activists, Naagbanton could not be bought off or silenced, according to those who knew him. Narrating Nigeria \u201cwith a caustic eye for detail and a stinging sense of the ridiculous\u201d, according to Concannon, Naagbanton\u2019s work focused mainly on the oil that underpins the Niger Delta. A huge source of wealth for the country, the communities living above the country\u2019s oil reserves have benefited little from it, and in many cases have had their lives and livelihoods destroyed by it. In 2011, the UN\u2019s Environment Programme released a major report on oil spills in Ogoniland, which said a clean-up was possible but would take 30 years and cost $1bn(\u00a30.8bn). Eight years on, the emergency measures it recommended, like cleaning up the drinking water supply, have not been taken and the Nigerian agency tasked with organising the clean-up, Hyprep, is accused of doing \u201cno significant remediation work\u201d. The head of Hyprep, Marvin Dekil, has said the company has been doing \u201cfeasibility studies\u201d. Shell, which started Nigeria\u2019s oil industry in the 1930s, stopped operations in Ogoniland in the 1990s, but its old pipelines still leak and are vandalised. Naagbanton worked with Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Ogoni activist who was executed by the Nigerian government in 1995, causing the country to be suspended from the Commonwealth. Like Saro-Wiwa, Naagbanton was also a poet. In a poem from his collection Fury of the Fisherwoman, a dirge that he dedicated to another Ogoni activist, he wrote lines that evoked his own constant battle to keep attention on the people and land he cared about: \u201cThis is the end of a noise at this breezy earth/ I am gone forever/ Farewell to a noise.\u201d",

Trump and his allies have responded by seeking to daze and disorient the public; they apparently hope to gaslight their way past high crimes and misdemeanors. With so many fires being set, attention is focused on the latest breaking news.</p> <p>Moreover, talk of congressional strategy and procedure is boring. That\u2019s true even for law professors like me. It\u2019s one thing to believe that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/28/donald-trump-richard-nixon-impeachment-robert-reich\">impeachment is necessary</a>; it\u2019s quite another to think about how the House will carry it out.</p> <p>But here, process is profoundly important. As Joshua Matz and I explain in our book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/End-Presidency-Power-Impeachment/dp/1541644883/ref=zg_bs_10817_4?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=XX5AA46STKXYKKEDPRH6\">To End a Presidency</a>: \u201cProcedure is where romantic ideas about legislators as the voice of the people collide with institutional reality. Good process is crucial to making thoughtful, accurate, and legitimate decisions. It\u2019s through these rules that Congress evaluates the evidence and structures its deliberations \u2026 Impeachments must therefore <em>be</em> fair and <em>appear</em> fair.\u201d</p> <p>First and foremost, that means undertaking a thorough investigation. The House cannot make a reasoned judgment about whether to impeach \u2013 and what to include in articles of impeachment \u2013 without a clear understanding of what exactly Trump (and those in his orbit) did wrong. And there is clearly much more to this story than is yet known publicly.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong: we already know a lot from the rough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trumps-phone-call-with-ukraines-president-read-the-full-transcript\">transcript of Trump\u2019s call</a> with Ukraine\u2019s president, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/26/whistleblower-trump-ukraine-read-in-full-text-document\">whistleblower complaint</a>, Trump\u2019s public statements, and credible news reports. That information alone supports a powerful case for impeachment.

Principles of due process require that Trump and other officials be afforded a meaningful opportunity to tell their story under oath. However unlikely, it is at least conceivable that they will offer context which casts the public record in a different light. At the same time, there is evidence that Trump\u2019s abuses rippled out in many directions. Even as it weighs Trump\u2019s fate, the House is duty-bound to examine any possible threats to national security and fair elections.</p> <p>So the House must investigate \u2013 and must do so quickly. This presents its own dilemma. Trump has spent the past year \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/video/trump_we_re_fighting_all_the_subpoenas\">fighting all the subpoenas</a>\u201d with bogus legal arguments meant to justify near-total defiance of Congress. The House has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/house-chairmen-sue-trump-administration-1356454\">gone to court</a> to compel compliance with its subpoenas, but judicial process can take months or years. If Trump persists in such tactics, he could deny the House access to key witnesses and testimony, or could string the House along while pretending (in bad faith) to negotiate.</p> <p>Given the urgency of the situation, the House has no choice but to issue a firm ultimatum to Trump: comply with our subpoenas immediately or we will infer that your unlawful obstruction is itself proof of guilt. This is well within the House\u2019s authority. When the House opens an impeachment inquiry, it wields <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/64318/how-impeachment-proceedings-would-strengthen-congresss-investigatory-powers/\">extraordinary constitutional powers</a> and serves as the ultimate check on a rogue president. It can therefore overcome virtually any executive branch privilege or immunity. Otherwise, the president could commit high crimes and misdemeanors and defeat accountability by simply defying all efforts to discover his wrongdoing.</p> <p>The House has already embarked on this path. On Friday, the House foreign affairs committee, in consultation with the House intelligence and oversight committees, issued a first round of subpoenas \u2013 and <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/2019-09-27.EEC%20Engel%20Schiff%20%20to%20Pompeo-%20State%20re%20Document%20Subpoena.pdf\">made clear to recipients</a> that \u201cyour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\u201d That is exactly the right procedure.</p> <p>Over the coming weeks, the House will presumably serve many more subpoenas. If the executive branch lawlessly refuses to turn over evidence demanded by the House, that will be <a href=\"https://time.com/5684605/trump-impeach-whistleblower-complaint/\">impeachable obstruction of Congress</a> and further proof of Trump\u2019s guilt. If evidence is turned over and tends to confirm that Trump abused his office, the House will need to move quickly toward articles of impeachment.</p> <p>That\u2019s where the judiciary committee comes in. Under the House rules \u2013 and <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Impeachment/\">consistent</a> with the Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/impeachment-trump-explained.html\">precedents</a> \u2013 the judiciary committee takes a lead role in the impeachment process.

It may wish to hold hearings on three sets of issues: first, the final factual conclusions reached by other committees that bear on impeachment; second, the many legal and constitutional judgments involved in deciding whether to impeach (and on what specific grounds); and finally, how the Ukraine issue might relate to other instances of self-dealing, obstruction, and abuse already under investigation. The judiciary committee has already adopted <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/whats-judiciary-committee-resolution-impeachment-procedures\">procedures for impeachment hearings</a> and can use them here (including a mechanism for allowing Trump to respond to its findings).</p> <p>Eventually, if impeachment is warranted, the judiciary committee \u2013 acting closely with the other investigating committees \u2013 will need to produce a detailed factual and legal report making that case, along with specific proposed articles for the House to vote on.

City cruised past the Swiss side Lugano 11-1 to reach the second knockout round but they will be out to make amends after the team whimpered out of the competition to Atl\u00e9tico in the round of 32 last season. Toni Duggan, who switched from Barcelona to the Spanish capital in the summer, will come up against her former club. Atl\u00e9tico, though, are already slightly off the pace in the league this season.

      "bodyText": "Cooper head butts himself Twin Peaks, picked by Holden_on Just when you think everything has gone well \u2013 Cooper is out of the Black Lodge, Annie is saved, Windom Earle defeated (albeit by Bob!) \u2013 it all goes wrong. Cooper goes to the bathroom to brush his teeth. He starts to grin, squeezes the toothpaste into the sink, rears his head back and head butts the mirror. In between the cracks in the mirror, Bob\u2019s face is staring back at him. I\u2019ve watched it eight times and I still feel queasy The West Wing, picked by NonOxbridgeColumnist It has to be the season one finale of The West Wing, leading up to the assassination attempt \u2013 and it\u2019s two cliffhangers in one episode. The cold opening (six and a half minutes by itself) takes you up to: \u201cI saw something ...\u201d and then you spend 30 minutes or so watching the previous 24 hours before lurching back to the present. Those last five minutes, with foreknowledge of something, seeing things you\u2019ve already watched from a different angle (most wonderfully Sam\u2019s smile at Toby after the \u201ctake-off\u201d sign, which brings me to the verge of tears just writing about it), are stomach-churningly tense. I\u2019ve watched it eight times and I still feel queasy. It\u2019s absolutely masterful writing. When Jack Bauer went too far 24, picked by StanleyGoodspeed The best ending of a 24 episode was when Jack Bauer had to execute his annoying but totally innocent and good-guy-in-the-end boss Ryan Shapiro in a scrapyard on the orders of the series villain, otherwise he would release a bio weapon. I kept thinking something or someone would save the day, or it was just a test to see how far Bauer would go. But it happened and the episode ended with a blank screen and no end credit music. The Doctor stranded with hungry cannibals banging at the door! Doctor Who, picked by chriskilby The Master, nicking the Doctor\u2019s Tardis and stranding him at the end of the universe with hungry cannibals banging at the door in Utopia, still takes some beating. Also, Edge of Darkness: \u201cGET ME PENDLETON!\u201d When the battered fleet jubilantly arrives at Earth Battlestar Galactica, picked by ExileCuChulainn Battlestar Galactica (the new one) when the battered fleet jubilantly arrives at Earth. Adama announces to the survivors that their journey is finally over. A party travel down to the surface, landing in the ruins of a large city. They are left speechless when they find Earth to be a desolate, radioactive, lifeless world, destroyed by nuclear conflict thousands of years previously. You knew someone was getting beaten to death \u2026 The Walking Dead, picked by mattblack81 The Walking Dead where Negan had them on their knees. You knew someone was getting beaten to death but you had to wait months to find out who. Because of the comics, there was lots of speculation but even when you think you knew, there was another twist. \u2018When Saga realises Martin killed Jens\u2019 The Bridge, picked by Literally I liked the second series of The Bridge. When Saga realises Martin killed Jens, we expected this would be the time for her to realise how much she likes Martin and understands his reasons \u2026 but she arrests him. \u2018That\u2019s Life milked it for an age\u2019 Dallas, picked by GonePhishing The JR thing was massive\u2019 it even spawned T-shirts with \u201cI Shot JR\u201d on them. Esther Rantzen and the That\u2019s Life! crew milked it for an age, doing weekly trawls of high streets in search of grannies\u2019 opinions. But it was at a time when there was very little TV choice. We had two and a half channels and not 24/7. Most telly finished at about midnight and didn\u2019t kick off again until about 9am, 11am at the earliest in BBC Two\u2019s case.

Thunberg\u2019s age and gender undoubtedly annoy her critics, but they\u2019re melting down because she explicitly makes the connections that scientists are generally unwilling to make. Namely that their scientific predictions for the climate, and the current economic and political order, may not be compatible.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">Last year\u2019s IPCC report</a> warned there were just 12 years left to avoid irreversible damage to the climate. Thunberg refers to this often, updating the count as if it were a timebomb strapped to the chest of her entire generation: the closer it gets to zero, the more radical action seems justified.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"31ad6886-1da5-45e7-960b-ecc71e3ed9ce\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CAYCUCCktac?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s a moral argument, fundamentally, that assumes the climate crisis will be worse than any disruption caused by addressing it. Carbon moves the deadly clock forward, and anything that facilitates that must be bad. She judges long-touted paradigms of \u201cgreen growth\u201d and market-based solutions as failures by this simple measure. \u201cIf solutions within this system are so impossible to find then maybe we should change the system itself,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.lifegate.com/people/news/greta-thunberg-speech-cop24\" title=\"\">she said at the UN climate conference</a> in Katowice last year.</p> \n<p>The right doesn\u2019t just mindlessly explode at every climate activist. Thunberg has none of the unthreatening geniality of Mr Inconvenient Truth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/change-is-coming-al-gore-says-economics-will-break-fossil-fuel-dinosaurs\" title=\"\">Al Gore</a>, or the various Hollywood celebrities who have taken on climate as a cause. She styles herself as a climate populist: she invokes a clear moral vision, a corrupt, unresponsive system \u2013 and has a knack for neatly separating an \u201cus\u201d and a \u201cthem\u201d. When she spoke of her supporters \u201cbeing mocked and lied about by elected officials, members of parliament, business leaders, journalists\u201d, she was drawing now-familiar political lines against the elite.</p> \n<p>This framing releases ordinary people from complicity in the climate crisis, just as other populisms release them from blame for their economic or social fate, and directs that feeling towards a political enemy. \u201cSome people say that the climate crisis is something that we all have created. But that is just another convenient lie,\u201d Thunberg told attendees <a href=\"https://www.lifegate.com/people/news/greta-thunberg-davos-world-economic-forum-video\" title=\"\">at Davos earlier this year</a>. \u201cSomeone is to blame.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change\" title=\"\">A 2017 report</a> showing that just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 has become a popular reference among protesters. The alchemy of populism is that powerlessness fuels anger rather than despair.</p> \n<p>Thunberg\u2019s critics previously understood exactly what to expect from the climate issue. Even if they didn\u2019t follow it closely, they could intuit, as most people could, that the mainstream channels of communication were gunked up with denial and obstruction, and international negotiations were governed by a politics that was accommodating to the status quo. Despite the lofty promises, no one believed anything would change. It isn\u2019t just that Thunberg has made climate politics popular, she has \u2013 for the first time since the early days of the climate justice movement \u2013 made them populist on a large scale, something these people rightly see as a threat to the more liberal order that suited them fine.

      "bodyText": "Greta Thunberg has made a lot of enemies. They are easy to recognise because their rage is so great they cannot help making themselves look ridiculous. Thunberg\u2019s arrival in the US earlier this month set off rightwing pundits and then the president himself. The conservative provocateur Dinesh D\u2019Souza compared her look to a Nazi propaganda poster; a Fox News guest called her a \u201cmentally ill Swedish child\u201d being exploited by her parents; and Trump mocked her on Twitter as a \u201chappy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future\u201d, after a speech in which she urgently laid out the dismal prospects for her generation\u2019s future. These are the latest attacks, but they aren\u2019t the darkest, or most unhinged. Arron Banks intimating that she might drown crossing the Atlantic in August might be the single worst example \u2013 or you can stare directly into the abyss by witnessing the depraved abuse Thunberg receives across the social media networks. Her many supporters seem baffled about why Thunberg triggers these attacks. \u201cWhat is it about Greta?\u201d they ask, puzzling over her apparent innocuousness; this slight girl with her oversized coats and hand-painted sign who insists we should simply \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d. Thunberg\u2019s age and gender undoubtedly annoy her critics, but they\u2019re melting down because she explicitly makes the connections that scientists are generally unwilling to make. Namely that their scientific predictions for the climate, and the current economic and political order, may not be compatible. Last year\u2019s IPCC report warned there were just 12 years left to avoid irreversible damage to the climate. Thunberg refers to this often, updating the count as if it were a timebomb strapped to the chest of her entire generation: the closer it gets to zero, the more radical action seems justified. It\u2019s a moral argument, fundamentally, that assumes the climate crisis will be worse than any disruption caused by addressing it. Carbon moves the deadly clock forward, and anything that facilitates that must be bad. She judges long-touted paradigms of \u201cgreen growth\u201d and market-based solutions as failures by this simple measure. \u201cIf solutions within this system are so impossible to find then maybe we should change the system itself,\u201d she said at the UN climate conference in Katowice last year. The right doesn\u2019t just mindlessly explode at every climate activist. Thunberg has none of the unthreatening geniality of Mr Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore, or the various Hollywood celebrities who have taken on climate as a cause. She styles herself as a climate populist: she invokes a clear moral vision, a corrupt, unresponsive system \u2013 and has a knack for neatly separating an \u201cus\u201d and a \u201cthem\u201d. When she spoke of her supporters \u201cbeing mocked and lied about by elected officials, members of parliament, business leaders, journalists\u201d, she was drawing now-familiar political lines against the elite. This framing releases ordinary people from complicity in the climate crisis, just as other populisms release them from blame for their economic or social fate, and directs that feeling towards a political enemy. \u201cSome people say that the climate crisis is something that we all have created. But that is just another convenient lie,\u201d Thunberg told attendees at Davos earlier this year. \u201cSomeone is to blame.\u201d A 2017 report showing that just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 has become a popular reference among protesters. The alchemy of populism is that powerlessness fuels anger rather than despair. Thunberg\u2019s critics previously understood exactly what to expect from the climate issue. Even if they didn\u2019t follow it closely, they could intuit, as most people could, that the mainstream channels of communication were gunked up with denial and obstruction, and international negotiations were governed by a politics that was accommodating to the status quo. Despite the lofty promises, no one believed anything would change. It isn\u2019t just that Thunberg has made climate politics popular, she has \u2013 for the first time since the early days of the climate justice movement \u2013 made them populist on a large scale, something these people rightly see as a threat to the more liberal order that suited them fine. A good reactionary recognises the potential vehicle for real change, and they hate it. In seeing this, Thunberg\u2019s red-faced peanut gallery hecklers are actually more perceptive than many of the liberal and centrist politicians who have taken to gushing over her without hearing her message. Justin Trudeau, for example, praised her last week while unveiling new climate policies that fell short of Thunberg\u2019s goals. After meeting with him, she claimed Trudeau was \u201cnot doing enough\u201d on climate \u2013 and she has previously called his government\u2019s doublespeak on climate policy \u201cshameful\u201d. It\u2019s not clear where Thunberg\u2019s politics lie, or where they will go in the future, but her rhetoric mirrors the left of the environmental movement, a wing of which has long cautioned that reductions in consumption and growth will be required to deal with the climate crisis. \u201cYou only speak of a green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular,\u201d she told delegates at the UN climate conference in Katowice last year, criticising the \u201csame bad ideas that got us into this mess\u201d, and telling them to pull \u201cthe emergency brake\u201d. Earlier this month in New York she continued the critique in front of world leaders. \u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can think of is money and fairytales of eternal growth: how dare you,\u201d she said, visibly angry. This is worth pointing out \u2013 not to claim Thunberg for any particular political faction, but to note that her main rhetorical targets are not denialist wingnuts, but the same mainstream politicians who invite her to speak and praise her activism. They beam at her as if she were their own child, and, perhaps in a similar way, they don\u2019t appear to hear her when she says it\u2019s their fault her life is ruined. It\u2019s the reaction of a group who have long considered themselves on the correct side of the climate divide, and thus, of history. As if a grand \u201cwe tried\u201d would satisfy the generations after them. Thunberg\u2019s great contribution is to convince the wider public of the bankruptcy of that outlook, and to indict years of missed targets as the failures that they are. Politicians don\u2019t appear to take this shift, or her, very seriously. They\u2019re happy to bask in her light, perhaps convinced this new insistence on immediacy will pass, as all the others did.

Speaking in the wake of drug company Vertex putting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/12/drug-maker-will-make-21bn-from-treating-cystic-fibrosis\">list price of \u00a3104,000 per patient per year</a> on the cystic fibrosis treatment <a href=\"https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/the-work-we-do/campaigning-hard/life-saving-drugs/orkambi\">Orkambi</a>, Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/106805/read-full-jeremy-corbyns-speech\">promised compulsory licensing</a> would secure generic versions of expensive patented medicines while a state-owned drug company would manufacture generics.</p> <p>A pharmaceutical company charging extortionate prices is a familiar story, but usually a pincer movement by regulator Nice and NHS England secures access to innovative treatments at manageable prices. The fact that Donald Trump has railed against national healthcare systems <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/15/trump-threatens-use-us-trade-talks-force-nhs-pay-drugs/\">\u201cfreeloading\u201d</a> on American drug companies is a measure of the NHS\u2019s success.</p> <p>The rules set by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Healthcare Organization</a> allow a government to <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/finance-and-efficiency/corbyn-vows-to-create-state-run-drug-company-and-seize-patent-rights/7026000.article\">issue licences</a> for generic versions of overpriced drugs. But any attempt to grab patents routinely would destabilise pharmaceutical research, particularly in the emerging era of personalised treatments and drugs for rare diseases. Companies understanding that exploitative behaviour runs serious risks may well benefit the NHS, but seizing patents should be the exception.</p> <p>The logic of a state-owned drug company producing generics is hard to fathom. The cost of generics is not a big problem; even if it were, it is difficult to see how this plan would help, considering these drugs are already produced efficiently across the globe. To make this viable, a government would have to establish a company (or nationalise an existing one) and produce drugs so much more cheaply than long-established manufacturers that the marginal savings would significantly outweigh the start-up costs within just a few years. It would be a massively high-risk enterprise for little gain.</p> <p>Enthusiasm for contracting out is waning across public services. Many councils are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/29/bringing-services-back-in-house-is-good-councils\">bringing services back in-house</a>, confident they can maintain the efficiencies while gaining control and flexibility. In the NHS, court action by private contractors who have lost bids has undermined trust, while sporadic attempts to push hospital staff into arm\u2019s-length companies are resisted.</p> <p>Labour is committed to bringing privately run services back into the NHS. Routine tendering of service contracts has failed, plaguing the NHS with high legal costs, inflexible contracts and poorly joined up services, while often destabilising NHS organisations who lost the business.</p> <p>But one dogma should not be replaced by another. If quality will be harmed by bringing a service back in-house, that is a disservice to patients. Similarly, an NHS provider should not have an inalienable right to hang on to a service no matter how poor. And, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/30/concerns-over-gp-at-hands-effect-on-local-primary-care-in-the-nhs\">whatever the initial difficulties</a>, companies will play a key role in making digital access to healthcare part of the everyday NHS experience. Simply put, the NHS staff running local health systems should be free to do what is best for patients.</p> <p>Labour is on firmer ground in its commitment to fight for a better deal from companies developing products with public money and NHS support. This is a growing issue for drugs and digital technology, and some NHS organisations have been naive in their commercial relationships. NHS England now has a tighter grip on issues such as sharing data \u2013 which is of huge value \u2013 but there is still further to go in ensuring that state support for product development is fairly rewarded in sharing revenues and giving the NHS a good price.</p> <p>The relationship between the NHS and the private sector needs to be reset to put power back in the hands of those with the interests of patients at heart. But the private sector still has an important and progressive role to play.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "As the Conservatives finalised their plans to bury the most egregious parts of the NHS reforms they forced through in 2012, Labour set out its healthcare policies. The Tories look set to play it safe on the NHS in the general election, adopting proposals from NHS England to drastically reduce the role of competition, sort out the legal mess around its structures and make it easier for hospitals, GPs and community services to work together. Labour, meanwhile, is gunning for drug companies and service contractors. Speaking in the wake of drug company Vertex putting a list price of \u00a3104,000 per patient per year on the cystic fibrosis treatment Orkambi, Jeremy Corbyn promised compulsory licensing would secure generic versions of expensive patented medicines while a state-owned drug company would manufacture generics. A pharmaceutical company charging extortionate prices is a familiar story, but usually a pincer movement by regulator Nice and NHS England secures access to innovative treatments at manageable prices. The fact that Donald Trump has railed against national healthcare systems \u201cfreeloading\u201d on American drug companies is a measure of the NHS\u2019s success. The rules set by the World Healthcare Organization allow a government to issue licences for generic versions of overpriced drugs. But any attempt to grab patents routinely would destabilise pharmaceutical research, particularly in the emerging era of personalised treatments and drugs for rare diseases. Companies understanding that exploitative behaviour runs serious risks may well benefit the NHS, but seizing patents should be the exception. The logic of a state-owned drug company producing generics is hard to fathom. The cost of generics is not a big problem; even if it were, it is difficult to see how this plan would help, considering these drugs are already produced efficiently across the globe. To make this viable, a government would have to establish a company (or nationalise an existing one) and produce drugs so much more cheaply than long-established manufacturers that the marginal savings would significantly outweigh the start-up costs within just a few years. It would be a massively high-risk enterprise for little gain. Enthusiasm for contracting out is waning across public services. Many councils are bringing services back in-house, confident they can maintain the efficiencies while gaining control and flexibility. In the NHS, court action by private contractors who have lost bids has undermined trust, while sporadic attempts to push hospital staff into arm\u2019s-length companies are resisted. Labour is committed to bringing privately run services back into the NHS. Routine tendering of service contracts has failed, plaguing the NHS with high legal costs, inflexible contracts and poorly joined up services, while often destabilising NHS organisations who lost the business. But one dogma should not be replaced by another. If quality will be harmed by bringing a service back in-house, that is a disservice to patients. Similarly, an NHS provider should not have an inalienable right to hang on to a service no matter how poor. And, whatever the initial difficulties, companies will play a key role in making digital access to healthcare part of the everyday NHS experience. Simply put, the NHS staff running local health systems should be free to do what is best for patients. Labour is on firmer ground in its commitment to fight for a better deal from companies developing products with public money and NHS support. This is a growing issue for drugs and digital technology, and some NHS organisations have been naive in their commercial relationships. NHS England now has a tighter grip on issues such as sharing data \u2013 which is of huge value \u2013 but there is still further to go in ensuring that state support for product development is fairly rewarded in sharing revenues and giving the NHS a good price. The relationship between the NHS and the private sector needs to be reset to put power back in the hands of those with the interests of patients at heart. But the private sector still has an important and progressive role to play. \u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst",

      "bodyText": "More than 100 people have died in flooding in the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where vast areas have been inundated by delayed monsoon rains. Videos shared on social media show submerged roads and heavy flooding at one of the major hospitals in Patna, state capital of Bihar, where patients lay on beds just inches above dirty water. Schools and offices are closed in many areas, and electricity supplies for some residents cut to one hour a day to prevent accidents. In Uttar Pradesh, 93 people have died due to the incessant rains, which has caused homes to collapse and led to an increase in snake bites. Dozens of people have also died in Bihar, where boats have been deployed to rescue stranded residents. Experts blame a lack of urban planning and poor drainage systems, which have been unable to cope with sudden and incessant rains over recent days. Anand Sharma, of the India Meteorological Department, said Bihar had experienced a deficit of monsoon rains until last week, when heavy rains returned levels to normal. A major cause of the flooding was the lack of natural drainage in affected areas, he explained. \u201cNatural drainage has been destroyed, natural ponds have been destroyed, people have built their houses on the flood plains. These are the problems because once you destroy the natural drainage, water doesn\u2019t find a place to go out. It leads to flooding,\u201d he added. Ravi Ranjan, who lives in Kankarbagh, in Patna, said he had sent his wife and young children away to protect them from the waist-high flood. Water had entered the ground-floor flat below him, he said, but he was OK because he lived on the first floor. \u201cEverything is under water, there is only water everywhere, all the cars are submerged, all the schools and offices are closed because of this rain. We can\u2019t go out, we can only see water everywhere,\u201d said Ranjan. Electricity is available for an hour each morning, he added. The nine-day Hindu festival Navaratri began on Sunday, but in flood-affected areas celebrations have been abandoned. \u201cThere is no mood of any festival. The festival season is in no one\u2019s mind,\u201d added Ranjan. The monsoon season, which runs from June through September, is crucial to replenishing water supplies across India, but hundreds die in the rains every year. More than 350 people have been killed by rain-related causes in India, Nepal and Bangladesh this monsoon season.",

School can wait, no problem.\u2019\u201d He was delighted she spoke Spanish, although he assumed she was a tourist and would be leaving in a week or so.

I need to ask her name and her number.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Isla got to her school and told her friend about the man she had met. \u201cI felt it was something out of the ordinary. I wasn\u2019t looking for anything. I had just come out of a long relationship, but it just sort of happened.\u201d</p> <p>The next night, Isla and her friends, including the one she had told about Valente, were at a bar.

And I was a bit drunk as well.\u201d</p> <p>She approached him; Valente says he was \u201creally surprised\u201d. He was with a friend he had already told about meeting Isla. \u201cI was on the dancefloor and Isla is in front of me, really excited.\u201d He had added her on Facebook the day they met. \u201cI sent her a sticker \u2013 of two cats on a motorbike. Isla said: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you write to me?\u2019 I said: \u2018I did \u2013 I sent a sticker.\u2019 She said: \u2018No, that\u2019s not writing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>They talked for a couple of hours \u2013 about music, film, their interests \u2013 then Valente invited her back to his friend\u2019s house.

      "body": "<h2>Little makes big difference for awesome Arsenal</h2> <p>Phil Neville has a nightmare task choosing just 18 names for next year\u2019s Olympic squad but at least one decision will by easy \u2013 Kim Little will be in it. She scored Arsenal\u2019s first goal in a 4-0 win over Brighton at the end of an excellent move, had a hand in the second and set up Jordan Nobbs for the fourth. Nobbs\u2019 goal was a little fortunate, ricocheting off a couple of legs on its way through a crowded penalty area and past an unsighted goalkeeper, but it is fantastic to see her back in goalscoring form after her long injury lay-off and her cushioned pass to set up Vivienne Miedema\u2019s goal was pure class. In this form Arsenal are a joy to watch and, even if Manchester City are still keeping pace with them at the top of the table with 100% records, will win the league at a canter. The Gunners seem to have worked their way past the defensive vulnerability of last season and with Lia Walti also back after long-term injury this could be another Arsenal Invincibles team in the making.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/manchester-united-women-liverpool-womens-super-league-match-report\">Liverpool report offensive \u2018Hillsborough chants\u2019 to Football Association</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Reiten leads the charge as Chelsea click into gear</h2> <p>In their first two WSL games, a 1-0 win over Spurs and a 1-1 draw at Brighton, Chelsea seemed a bit disjointed and certainly weren\u2019t firing on all cylinders. On Sunday they were back to their best in a 4-0 thrashing of Bristol City \u2013 they had 24 shots to the home side\u2019s one, 12 shots on target to Bristol\u2019s none, and 15 corners to their opponents\u2019 two (which were both won in the space of a single minute). Bristol had no answer to Guro Reiten\u2019s pace down the left, and she scored the two opening goals inside the first 10 minutes. Importantly, this was the first time that Reiten, Ji So-yun and Fran Kirby have started together this season. Those players are all individually world class, but when they play together they become even more effective. Everything clicked into place for Chelsea and if it wasn\u2019t for Sophie Baggaley in the Bristol City goal the scoreline could easily have reached Manchester City v Watford proportions. Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, said afterwards that her players are \u201cstill finding their best form\u201d, which given the quality of this performance might worry a few people.</p> <h2>James shows new kids on the block have got the right stuff</h2> <p>Sibling rivalry seemed to spur Lauren James on to new heights as, four days after her brother Reece scored his first senior goal for Chelsea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/25/chelsea-grimsby-carabao-cup-match-report\">in the Carabao Cup</a>, her outstanding effort put Manchester United on their way to victory over Liverpool. United had not scored at all this season, losing 1-0 to the last two champions, Arsenal and Manchester City, in their first two fixtures, so that effort from James, who turned 18 on Sunday, was their first of the campaign and they sealed the points in stoppage time after a burst infield from the left by Leah Galton led to a penalty which was converted by their captain and former Liverpool player, Katie Zelem. This was a decent test against a settled Liverpool side and Casey Stoney\u2019s side continued their stylish introduction to the WSL. United are slick, confident and extremely well organised, and look set to make a serious impact in the top flight.</p> <h2>Spurs\u2019 storming success dispels doubts</h2> <p>The second-highest crowd in the history of the WSL \u2013 24,790 \u2013 saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/29/west-ham-tottenham-womens-super-league-match-report\">a big upset</a> at the London Stadium. Newly-promoted Spurs came out on top against ambitious West Ham, with Rianna Dean scoring with a textbook header into the bottom corner in the first half, the home side having already spurned a number of opportunities, and after Alisha Lehmann and Adriana Leon both came close to an equaliser Lucy Quinn sealed the point with a clean, low strike past Courtney Brosnan with six minutes remaining. The Tottenham team included seven of the players who started the 4-0 Continental Cup defeat at home to Reading in their last game but any doubters \u2013 including me \u2013 now need to have a word with themselves, after a second win in three WSL games. Like United Spurs are impressing in their debut WSL season \u2013 the two new sides meet each other in their next fixture, after the international break.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Everton on the up despite City defeat</h2> <p>After beating Birmingham and Bristol in their first two games Everton\u2019s 100% record came to an end against Manchester City but the scoreline was close and even in defeat they showed that they are a refreshed and more confident side than the one that struggled last season.

      "bodyText": "Little makes big difference for awesome Arsenal Phil Neville has a nightmare task choosing just 18 names for next year\u2019s Olympic squad but at least one decision will by easy \u2013 Kim Little will be in it. She scored Arsenal\u2019s first goal in a 4-0 win over Brighton at the end of an excellent move, had a hand in the second and set up Jordan Nobbs for the fourth. Nobbs\u2019 goal was a little fortunate, ricocheting off a couple of legs on its way through a crowded penalty area and past an unsighted goalkeeper, but it is fantastic to see her back in goalscoring form after her long injury lay-off and her cushioned pass to set up Vivienne Miedema\u2019s goal was pure class. In this form Arsenal are a joy to watch and, even if Manchester City are still keeping pace with them at the top of the table with 100% records, will win the league at a canter. The Gunners seem to have worked their way past the defensive vulnerability of last season and with Lia Walti also back after long-term injury this could be another Arsenal Invincibles team in the making. Reiten leads the charge as Chelsea click into gear In their first two WSL games, a 1-0 win over Spurs and a 1-1 draw at Brighton, Chelsea seemed a bit disjointed and certainly weren\u2019t firing on all cylinders. On Sunday they were back to their best in a 4-0 thrashing of Bristol City \u2013 they had 24 shots to the home side\u2019s one, 12 shots on target to Bristol\u2019s none, and 15 corners to their opponents\u2019 two (which were both won in the space of a single minute). Bristol had no answer to Guro Reiten\u2019s pace down the left, and she scored the two opening goals inside the first 10 minutes. Importantly, this was the first time that Reiten, Ji So-yun and Fran Kirby have started together this season. Those players are all individually world class, but when they play together they become even more effective. Everything clicked into place for Chelsea and if it wasn\u2019t for Sophie Baggaley in the Bristol City goal the scoreline could easily have reached Manchester City v Watford proportions. Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, said afterwards that her players are \u201cstill finding their best form\u201d, which given the quality of this performance might worry a few people. James shows new kids on the block have got the right stuff Sibling rivalry seemed to spur Lauren James on to new heights as, four days after her brother Reece scored his first senior goal for Chelsea in the Carabao Cup, her outstanding effort put Manchester United on their way to victory over Liverpool. United had not scored at all this season, losing 1-0 to the last two champions, Arsenal and Manchester City, in their first two fixtures, so that effort from James, who turned 18 on Sunday, was their first of the campaign and they sealed the points in stoppage time after a burst infield from the left by Leah Galton led to a penalty which was converted by their captain and former Liverpool player, Katie Zelem. This was a decent test against a settled Liverpool side and Casey Stoney\u2019s side continued their stylish introduction to the WSL. United are slick, confident and extremely well organised, and look set to make a serious impact in the top flight. Spurs\u2019 storming success dispels doubts The second-highest crowd in the history of the WSL \u2013 24,790 \u2013 saw a big upset at the London Stadium. Newly-promoted Spurs came out on top against ambitious West Ham, with Rianna Dean scoring with a textbook header into the bottom corner in the first half, the home side having already spurned a number of opportunities, and after Alisha Lehmann and Adriana Leon both came close to an equaliser Lucy Quinn sealed the point with a clean, low strike past Courtney Brosnan with six minutes remaining. The Tottenham team included seven of the players who started the 4-0 Continental Cup defeat at home to Reading in their last game but any doubters \u2013 including me \u2013 now need to have a word with themselves, after a second win in three WSL games. Like United Spurs are impressing in their debut WSL season \u2013 the two new sides meet each other in their next fixture, after the international break. Everton on the up despite City defeat After beating Birmingham and Bristol in their first two games Everton\u2019s 100% record came to an end against Manchester City but the scoreline was close and even in defeat they showed that they are a refreshed and more confident side than the one that struggled last season. Tinja-Riikka Korpela, the experienced Finnish goalkeeper who arrived this summer on a one-year deal, has made a huge difference to how Everton set up in possession, and she made a string of top saves, memorably denying Janine Beckie and Pauline Bremer. It was a beautiful, trademark free-kick from the England captain Steph Houghton that was the difference, shooting low past the wall and a wrong-footed goalkeeper in the seventh minute, and with much of the game played amid a biblical downpour that remained the defining moment. Chloe Kelly and Hannah Cain tested Ellie Roebuck in the City goal but Everton\u2019s first defeat of the season was, while marginal, not undeserved.

      "body": "<p>Mario Balotelli scored his first goal for his hometown club on Sunday, not that he needed it to make headlines. He had stolen the show as soon as he emerged from the tunnel at the Stadio San Paolo, carrying his six-year-old daughter, Pia. She stayed with him all through the pre-game handshakes before Brescia\u2019s match against Napoli, then went to join her mother, Raffaella Fico, in the stands.</p> \n<p>The tenderness of their interactions would have melted hearts under any circumstances. But there was a layer of history here as well. In 2014, Balotelli <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/10/serie-a-talking-points-mario-balotelli\">wept for Pia in the away dugout</a> at this same stadium, overwhelmed by emotions in the week when his paternity was confirmed by a DNA test.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/racism-in-italian-football-a-scourge-of-youth-game-too-say-campaigners\">Italian football racism a scourge of youth game too, say campaigners</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So many things were different back then. Balotelli was playing for Milan, and starting regularly for the Italian national team. He occupied a space at the centre of a nation\u2019s attention, his turbulent relationship with Fico a favourite topic of gossip magazines. Days earlier, Gazzetta dello Sport had dedicated a full front page to his haircut.</p> \n<p>You could hardly say that Balotelli has a low profile today, but the context has certainly changed. His star waned during consecutive difficult seasons with Liverpool and then back at Milan. The striker found happier homes in Nice and Marseille, but he was still out of sight and out of mind for many Italians. Of Balotelli\u2019s 36 caps for the Azzurri, only three have arrived in the past five years.</p> \n<p>Perhaps, on a personal level, a bit of space was exactly what he needed. Balotelli\u2019s relationship with Fico has certainly improved. He did not get to meet Pia for the first time until a family court date two months after his tears against Napoli. These days he sees her regularly, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwVSxTtldoy/\">shares jokes with Fico on social media</a>.</p> \n<p>If Balotelli could have had things all his own way this summer, they would all be closer still. Pia lives with Fico in Naples. In March, Balotelli told the newspaper La Provence that Napoli were the only team in Italy that he wanted to play for. That was before Brescia won promotion to the top flight. The idea that Balotelli could ever represent his own city\u2019s club might have seemed fanciful while they were toiling in Serie B. Frankly, it still did even after they finished in first place.</p> \n<p>But Brescia are owned by Massimo Cellino these days, a man fond of making headlines of his own. He appealed to Balotelli\u2019s emotions and made it clear that he was willing to shatter the club\u2019s wage structure. It was enough to overcome the player\u2019s reluctance to get involved in a relegation scrap. Balotelli soon found joy in familiar surroundings. \u201cThe most beautiful thing is getting to eat lunch and dinner with my mum,\u201d he told the broadcaster Dazn. \u201cThe last time I ate regularly with my mum I was 14 years old.\u201d</p> \n<p>Suspended for the first four games of the new season, thanks to a red card he received for a dangerous challenge in his final appearance for Marseille, Balotelli made his debut in Tuesday\u2019s home defeat against Juventus. To go from there to an away game against Napoli represented about as challenging a reintroduction to Serie A as can be imagined.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62c7ea629c3eb08cb7d99b8a6a2288a6b64bfe56\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62c7ea629c3eb08cb7d99b8a6a2288a6b64bfe56/0_0_2359_1714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Balotelli\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mario Balotelli celebrates with Daniele Dessena after scoring for Brescia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ciro de Luca/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The fixture list had already done no favours to Brescia, handing them just one home game out of the first four. And yet, they were competitive even without Balotelli. Alfredo Donnarumma \u2013 Serie B\u2019s top scorer last season \u2013 already had three goals in four matches before adding another against Juventus. Sandro Tonali has been a revelation in midfield, a 19-year-old who dictates the tempo and direction of a game as though he has been doing it for a lifetime.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/30/wagner-schalke-surprise-leipzig-rabbi-matondo\">Wagner makes Schalke believe again after springing a surprise at Leipzig | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The latter would sparkle once again on Sunday. Napoli jumped out to an early lead against Brescia, Dries Mertens converting Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n\u2019s clumsy cutback before Kostas Manolas \u2013 having already seen one goal (rightly) disallowed \u2013 made it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time. Brescia, though, refused to be overawed. Tonali thought he had reduced the arrears with a beautifully-struck first-time shot from the edge of the box shortly after the break, but a VAR review found that Dimitri Bisoli had fouled Nikola Maksimovic to win back possession in the build-up.</p> \n<p>Instead, it would be Balotelli who scored next: heading home from a Tonali corner. It was his first goal in Serie A for 1,468 days. He celebrated with the same understated manner that he has for so many others: raising a simple thumbs-up towards his teammate as he turned to jog back towards the centre-circle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up for our daily football email. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was not enough to rescue a draw for Brescia, though they pressed hard against opponents who lost both of their starting centre-backs \u2013 Manolas and Maksimovic \u2013 to injury in the second half. But Balotelli\u2019s goal and smooth integration will provide further encouragement to a side that has stayed true to their attack-minded and ambitious footballing identity under Eugenio Corini.</p> \n<p>For Balotelli himself, the abiding memory of this match would simply be that moment before kick-off with his daughter. He posted a picture on Instagram later in the day, describing it as a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2_2tRkIU0n/\">\u201cdream come true\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Among the \u2018likes\u2019 it received was one from the Italy manager, Roberto Mancini. They, too, have shared history, title winners together at Manchester City. At 29 years old, Balotelli hopes there is time yet for their relationship to flourish anew as well.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Not since 1938-39 had Milan lost four of their first six matches in a Serie A season. They were not just beaten but comprehensively outclassed by Fiorentina at San Siro, the 3-1 margin of defeat frankly flattering them. Could Marco Giampaolo lose his job already? There were reports of the club\u2019s directors meeting long into the night on Sunday, and the manager certainly has plenty of responsibility to bear. That said, this is also a collective failure. Milan spent another \u20ac100m this summer. What do they have to show for it?</p> \n<p>\u2022 Fiorentina, it must be stressed, were excellent. I enjoyed Vincenzo Montella\u2019s candid response to being asked whether this was best win of his tenure: \u201cWell, it\u2019s pretty much the only game I\u2019ve won!\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Quite the first start for Alexis Sanchez at Inter. First he tried to claim a Stefano Sensi goal that skimmed off his bum on the way in, then he scored a goal of his own, and finally he got himself sent off for a second booking when diving in the box with his team already 2-0 up. All in the space of 46 minutes. Still, six wins from six now for Inter \u2013 which sets things up nicely for next week\u2019s Derby d\u2019Italia against Juventus.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Big wins for both Atalanta and Lazio, both of whom have veered between brilliant performances and frustrating ones in this campaign. If the Biancocelesti had displayed such clinical finishing in their midweek game against Inter, we might already be putting a very different assessment on this team.</p> \n<figure class=\"element

      "bodyText": "Mario Balotelli scored his first goal for his hometown club on Sunday, not that he needed it to make headlines. He had stolen the show as soon as he emerged from the tunnel at the Stadio San Paolo, carrying his six-year-old daughter, Pia. She stayed with him all through the pre-game handshakes before Brescia\u2019s match against Napoli, then went to join her mother, Raffaella Fico, in the stands. The tenderness of their interactions would have melted hearts under any circumstances. But there was a layer of history here as well. In 2014, Balotelli wept for Pia in the away dugout at this same stadium, overwhelmed by emotions in the week when his paternity was confirmed by a DNA test. So many things were different back then. Balotelli was playing for Milan, and starting regularly for the Italian national team. He occupied a space at the centre of a nation\u2019s attention, his turbulent relationship with Fico a favourite topic of gossip magazines. Days earlier, Gazzetta dello Sport had dedicated a full front page to his haircut. You could hardly say that Balotelli has a low profile today, but the context has certainly changed. His star waned during consecutive difficult seasons with Liverpool and then back at Milan. The striker found happier homes in Nice and Marseille, but he was still out of sight and out of mind for many Italians. Of Balotelli\u2019s 36 caps for the Azzurri, only three have arrived in the past five years. Perhaps, on a personal level, a bit of space was exactly what he needed. Balotelli\u2019s relationship with Fico has certainly improved. He did not get to meet Pia for the first time until a family court date two months after his tears against Napoli. These days he sees her regularly, and shares jokes with Fico on social media. If Balotelli could have had things all his own way this summer, they would all be closer still. Pia lives with Fico in Naples. In March, Balotelli told the newspaper La Provence that Napoli were the only team in Italy that he wanted to play for. That was before Brescia won promotion to the top flight. The idea that Balotelli could ever represent his own city\u2019s club might have seemed fanciful while they were toiling in Serie B. Frankly, it still did even after they finished in first place. But Brescia are owned by Massimo Cellino these days, a man fond of making headlines of his own. He appealed to Balotelli\u2019s emotions and made it clear that he was willing to shatter the club\u2019s wage structure. It was enough to overcome the player\u2019s reluctance to get involved in a relegation scrap. Balotelli soon found joy in familiar surroundings. \u201cThe most beautiful thing is getting to eat lunch and dinner with my mum,\u201d he told the broadcaster Dazn. \u201cThe last time I ate regularly with my mum I was 14 years old.\u201d Suspended for the first four games of the new season, thanks to a red card he received for a dangerous challenge in his final appearance for Marseille, Balotelli made his debut in Tuesday\u2019s home defeat against Juventus. To go from there to an away game against Napoli represented about as challenging a reintroduction to Serie A as can be imagined. The fixture list had already done no favours to Brescia, handing them just one home game out of the first four. And yet, they were competitive even without Balotelli. Alfredo Donnarumma \u2013 Serie B\u2019s top scorer last season \u2013 already had three goals in four matches before adding another against Juventus. Sandro Tonali has been a revelation in midfield, a 19-year-old who dictates the tempo and direction of a game as though he has been doing it for a lifetime. The latter would sparkle once again on Sunday. Napoli jumped out to an early lead against Brescia, Dries Mertens converting Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n\u2019s clumsy cutback before Kostas Manolas \u2013 having already seen one goal (rightly) disallowed \u2013 made it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time. Brescia, though, refused to be overawed. Tonali thought he had reduced the arrears with a beautifully-struck first-time shot from the edge of the box shortly after the break, but a VAR review found that Dimitri Bisoli had fouled Nikola Maksimovic to win back possession in the build-up. Instead, it would be Balotelli who scored next: heading home from a Tonali corner. It was his first goal in Serie A for 1,468 days. He celebrated with the same understated manner that he has for so many others: raising a simple thumbs-up towards his teammate as he turned to jog back towards the centre-circle. It was not enough to rescue a draw for Brescia, though they pressed hard against opponents who lost both of their starting centre-backs \u2013 Manolas and Maksimovic \u2013 to injury in the second half. But Balotelli\u2019s goal and smooth integration will provide further encouragement to a side that has stayed true to their attack-minded and ambitious footballing identity under Eugenio Corini. For Balotelli himself, the abiding memory of this match would simply be that moment before kick-off with his daughter. He posted a picture on Instagram later in the day, describing it as a \u201cdream come true\u201d. Among the \u2018likes\u2019 it received was one from the Italy manager, Roberto Mancini. They, too, have shared history, title winners together at Manchester City. At 29 years old, Balotelli hopes there is time yet for their relationship to flourish anew as well. Talking points \u2022 Not since 1938-39 had Milan lost four of their first six matches in a Serie A season. They were not just beaten but comprehensively outclassed by Fiorentina at San Siro, the 3-1 margin of defeat frankly flattering them. Could Marco Giampaolo lose his job already? There were reports of the club\u2019s directors meeting long into the night on Sunday, and the manager certainly has plenty of responsibility to bear. That said, this is also a collective failure. Milan spent another \u20ac100m this summer. What do they have to show for it? \u2022 Fiorentina, it must be stressed, were excellent. I enjoyed Vincenzo Montella\u2019s candid response to being asked whether this was best win of his tenure: \u201cWell, it\u2019s pretty much the only game I\u2019ve won!\u201d \u2022 Quite the first start for Alexis Sanchez at Inter. First he tried to claim a Stefano Sensi goal that skimmed off his bum on the way in, then he scored a goal of his own, and finally he got himself sent off for a second booking when diving in the box with his team already 2-0 up. All in the space of 46 minutes. Still, six wins from six now for Inter \u2013 which sets things up nicely for next week\u2019s Derby d\u2019Italia against Juventus. \u2022 Big wins for both Atalanta and Lazio, both of whom have veered between brilliant performances and frustrating ones in this campaign. If the Biancocelesti had displayed such clinical finishing in their midweek game against Inter, we might already be putting a very different assessment on this team.",

China has ramped up its own security ahead of the anniversary celebration, with a heavy security presence in Beijing and a crackdown on human rights activists to prevent them protesting and speaking to foreign media. Democracy, but different. Chinese protesters have been calling for democracy in different forms for a century, says Hans van de Ven.

      "bodyText": "There are few places in Tokyo as polarising as Bar Martha. Online reviews congregate heavily around both ends of the scale and, depending which you listen to, it is either the \u201cworst experience in Tokyo\u201d or \u201cbrilliantly unapologetic\u201d and \u201ccoolest place in the city\u201d. This is no accident \u2013 few things are at this bar. Rather it is the product of the take-no-prisoners attitude of the bar\u2019s owner, Wataru Fukuyama, a 56-year-old visionary or tyrant, according to your take on him. Bar Martha is what is known in Japan as a listening bar, where music comes first and talking a definite second. Though there are others in the city \u2013 JBS and Grandfather\u2019s are among the better-known \u2013 Bar Martha, in Tokyo\u2019s Ebisu neighbourhood, is further off the beaten track, patronised by Japanese audiophiles and well-dressed locals. Those who talk too loudly or disturb the atmosphere are liable to be unceremoniously thrown out. This is not a place to visit in a large group ready for loud and lively conversation; groups larger than two or three should head instead to an izakaya (pub). \u201cI have never run a bar that has considered what the customer wants,\u201d says Fukuyama tells us one evening at his bar. \u201cPeople often say that the customer is always right, but I\u2019m not confident that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t do something just because it will attract customers. [Bar Martha] is about what I like doing and the kind of place I want to run.\u201d What Fukuyama likes is music. Enter the softly lit, cavernous bar space and, after a brief explanation of the rules, you\u2019ll be greeted by a vast wall of more than 6,000 vinyl records, which Fukuyama plays on twin turntables. Music is played across two 1960s Tannoy speakers, which Fukuyama chose for a vintage quality that sounds \u201cakin to a rainy day in the UK\u201d, where the speakers were originally built. \u201cI look at the customers and think \u2018who is listening?\u2019\u201d says Fukuyama. \u201cOnly 50 people can be in here at any one time. I often play music for the one person who is listening most intently. I think to myself, \u2018How old are they? What would they want to listen to?\u2019 I play something and watch for their reaction.\u201d Over the course of an evening, the soundtrack shifts from mellow Ella Fitzgerald to the raucous clang of The Clash\u2019s \u201cShould I Stay or Should I Go\u201d, shifting with the flow of customers in and out of the bar. The music is never static, never dwells on one genre for too long. Nestled between and in front of the speakers are rows of high-end bottles of whisky, glistening beneath spotlights. The spirit is Bar Martha\u2019s main focus, but the menu is all-encompassing, and ranges from draft beer through to a very enjoyable mango mojito. The 50 seats are spread between a long wooden counter (sit here to be closest to the bartenders, the vinyls and the watchful eye of Fukuyama) and more intimate hardwood tables in the recesses toward the back. All designed by Fukuyama, it is extraordinarily photogenic, but here comes the most frequent sticking point: photos are absolutely forbidden; Fukuyama doesn\u2019t use the internet and has no desire for a presence on social media. If caught, you will be politely but firmly be asked to leave or have your next drinks order refused.

      "body": "<p>In the autumn of 1997, I was a fresher at the University of Glasgow. Months after the Labour landslide, weeks after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, I was an 18-year-old British-Indian made up of equal parts teenage kicks, terror and Topshop <strong>\u2013</strong> and on my way to Scotland for the first time, to live and study in a city I had never even visited. I was a 90s Londoner in every sense: geographically ignorant, cocky, earnestly carrying a pager. North, to me, meant north of the Thames. Yet there I was, on a train nosing true north on the west coast mainline.</p> <p>At Euston station, I was waved off by my parents. I remember nothing of this momentous goodbye. In Carlisle, I felt a great sense of occasion because I thought we had crossed the border. By Motherwell, I was all grown up. In Glasgow, seeing the towering gothic spire of the fourth oldest university in the UK from my cab window, I thought it was the cathedral. When the driver informed me that it was, in fact, my university, I gasped. Had I even seen the prospectus?</p> <p>Twenty-two years later, I am on another train. Forty years old, less cocky, the pager replaced by a scratched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/18/samsung-galaxy-a5-review-a-mid-range-smartphone-with-high-end-looks-and-feel\" title=\"\">Samsung A5</a>, but once more on my way to my alma mater \u2013 as no one in Glasgow calls it. This time, I am heading west from Edinburgh: I never did go back to England.</p> <p>I am off to meet some freshers and do the things that freshers in 2019 do. Which is, according to my assumptions, drink less. Work more. Do more interacting on social media than freshers\u2019-flu-inducing socialising. Worry about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/12/is-a-british-university-degree-really-worth-it-any-more\" title=\"\">the financial burden of a degree</a>, an unstable job market, rent hikes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/05/students-staff-uk-universities-sexual-harassment-epidemic\" title=\"\">epidemic levels of sexual harassment on UK campuses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/07/one-climate-crisis-disaster-happening-every-week-un-warns\" title=\"\">climate crisis</a>, Brexit and whatever fresh hell is playing out in Westminster. My abiding sense is of a generation of young people carrying a lot more on their young shoulders than mine did. Many have voted in neither a general election nor a referendum, yet find themselves living in the most turbulent period of British history since well before their parents were born.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbe76ae89a2b2d38679181b2732e170c9f7c0bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbe76ae89a2b2d38679181b2732e170c9f7c0bac/754_27_4367_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Christie, 18, from Perth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I probably wouldn\u2019t have come if you had to pay for it\u2019 ...

Crazy busy, strewn with Domino\u2019s branding (free pizza is being handed out at the main gate), soundtracked by tinny beats pumped out of who knows where, filled with a sea of friendly and daunted faces. The fashion, too, has come full circle: jeans, T-shirts, check shirts, trainers, a surfeit of blue- and pink-dyed hair. The front page of the university newspaper, the Glasgow Guardian, carries a splash about <a href=\"https://glasgowguardian.co.uk/2019/09/15/glasgow-university-invests-over-3m-in-arms-trade-and-military-services-providers/\" title=\"\">the university\u2019s \u00a33m investment in the arms trade</a>, plus stories about tackling Glasgow stereotypes and where to get cheap cocktails. Wandering along University Avenue, I am offered a free bible, a copy of Socialist Worker and a flyer for pole-dancing classes. Plus \u00e7a change.</p> <p>In room 243 \u2013 found despite the directions \u201cbetween cloisters and south front\u201d that I still find incomprehensible \u2013 I meet the four freshers I will be hanging out with. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d says Nina Smith, 17, from Paisley, six miles south-west. \u201cBut it\u2019s a nice place to be lost.\u201d It is her first day and she is finding freshers\u2019 week \u201ca bit scary\u201d. Studying German and music, she works part-time in Ikea (16 hours a week, often jumping to 25) and is starting a shift at 5pm. All four students have a part-time job or are looking for one. When I started, the year before tuition fees were introduced UK-wide and at the tail end of grants, I worked only during the summer holidays, pulling pints in a pub back home, and it was for spending money, not to get by. Smith, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t even sure she was going to apply to university. What would she have done instead? \u201cI was thinking about taking a gap year and working full-time. Saving money. Then I thought: \u2018If I do that, I won\u2019t want to go to uni.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lewis Hannah, 17, is from Airdrie, to the east of Glasgow, and studying physics. Like Smith, he will be staying at home and commuting. \u201cAll my friends except one are staying at home,\u201d he says. The next day, after an Abba/Queen \u201cMassaoke\u201d night \u2013 in which a live band played the bands\u2019 hits and the lyrics were projected on to a giant screen for a singalong; you could attend only with a \u00a348 freshers\u2019 wristband \u2013 I phone to see how it went. \u201cThe union was packed. You could barely move.\u201d Was it fun? \u201cYeah, I was there until the end, about 2am.\u201d How did he get home? \u201cMy mum picked me up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"acc508b3855b55e5017680854b91ca2cf6950161\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acc508b3855b55e5017680854b91ca2cf6950161/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four freshers at Glasgow university looking at a \u2018unicorn\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A \u201cunicorn\u201d outside Glasgow\u2019s freshers\u2019 fair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rachel Christie, 18, is the only one of the four staying in university accommodation. \u201cPerth is too far,\u201d she explains. What are her halls like? \u201cA bit overpriced,\u201d she says. \u201cI would have preferred private accommodation.\u201d Cooking for herself is \u201cOK, but the kitchen is a mess. No one cleans up after themselves. And my oven doesn\u2019t work.\u201d She concedes that it is good for meeting people. When I phone her the following day, to see how her night out at an Iyaz gig went, the social benefits of halls are clear. \u201cFirst I went to another flat with my friends and we drank there for a bit,\u201d she says. Is she hungover? \u201cNo, just a bit tired,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>She and Hannah are the first people in their families to go to university. Three out of four of the group are part of the UK-wide <a href=\"https://www.gla.ac.uk/study/wp/\" title=\"\">Widening Participation</a> programme, which aims to attract people who live in certain postcode areas; have been in care; have caring responsibilities, a disability or an impairment; or are estranged from family.</p> <p>Murrin Duggan, from outside Port Glasgow, 15 miles west of Glasgow, is one of a handful of 16-year-olds enrolling as a first-year undergraduate in 2019. She and Christie are studying French, Spanish and Portuguese. Although it is common for freshers to be 17 in Scotland, 16 is unusually young. Why did she come so early? \u201cWhen Brexit comes, we don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Duggan says. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I left school early. I just want to make sure I get into uni, because you never know. You might start getting charged for it, and it\u2019s quite a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have come if you had to pay for it,\u201d Christie adds.</p> <p>\u201cSame,\u201d says Smith. \u201cGo while you can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49ba9d5602b612842691ae9b562a31a1d77af2f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49ba9d5602b612842691ae9b562a31a1d77af2f2/1067_723_4046_2428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Murrin Duggan, 16, from Port Glasgow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When Brexit comes, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.

At Glasgow, half the students come from Scotland. I remember being struck not only by the university\u2019s Scottishness, but also how Glaswegian it was. It also felt very white, especially in the arts and humanities departments where I studied English literature and philosophy. Everyone tells me how radically different the university is now, which is clear from the multitude of languages I hear on campus. There are about 6,500 international students, 3,000 EU students and 1,300 European staff. How this might change after Brexit remains to be seen. \u201cEU students pay no tuition fees here,\u201d explains Rachel Sandison, a vice-principal at the university. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed us to welcome really high-quality European talent into Stem [science, technology, engineering and maths] subjects.\u201d The consequences of a no-deal Brexit, she says, would be \u201chuge\u201d.</p> <p>Memory is an unearthly form of archeology. I thought I remembered almost nothing of freshers\u2019 week, but when I got off the tube at Hillhead subway station in the West End I experienced what the novelist Muriel Spark described as \u201can inpouring of love\u201d for those intense days. The smell of hormones, disinfectant, cigarette smoke and club smoke machines. An excruciating traffic-light party at the GU union. (I wore amber.) The sound of Chumbawamba\u2019s Tubthumping everywhere. A poster fair where I bought a Steve McQueen still from Bullitt, even though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/bullitt-yates-action\" title=\"\">I had never seen the film</a> and didn\u2019t fancy its hypermasculine lead.</p> <p>What I really remember, though, is drinking. A lot. It felt like an expectation and really good fun. A 1997 freshers\u2019 guide sent to me by the archive department introduced the week as a \u201cpre-term drinking and entertainment extravaganza organised in your honour\u201d. One of the biggest changes in the two decades since I was a student is the way alcohol is perceived and consumed. According to a survey by University College London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/19/im-not-spending-money-on-that-the-rise-of-the-teetotal-student\" title=\"\">36%</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/19/im-not-spending-money-on-that-the-rise-of-the-teetotal-student\" title=\"\"> of 16- to 24-year-olds in full-time education </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/19/im-not-spending-money-on-that-the-rise-of-the-teetotal-student\" title=\"\">abstain from drinking</a>. \u201cI was a bit nervous, because I don\u2019t drink,\u201d says Duggan. \u201cBut I\u2019ve met a lot of people who don\u2019t drink, either. It\u2019s not what I expected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b151d65e65fc1ed2b351d4739c7220af9c4bba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b151d65e65fc1ed2b351d4739c7220af9c4bba2/0_166_5298_3179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nina Smith, 17, from Paisley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was thinking about working full-time.

In 1997, the internet amounted to sitting in front of a Netscape Navigator screen and pretending to \u201cdo\u201d the world wide web. None of the students I meet worry about online harassment. Yet, earlier this month, Dr Emma Short, the director of the National Centre for Cyberstalking Research at the University of Bedfordshire, said a watershed had been reached with the first generation of digital natives entering higher education. \u201cThe thresholds in universities for what has become normalised behaviour very often exceed criminal prosecution thresholds,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThings like persistent messaging, flooding messaging across platforms, pushing for DMs [direct messages]. The moment a person on the receiving end begins to feel fear and unease, you\u2019re in the realm of harassment. And students will tolerate much higher levels of risk than I would say are safe levels.\u201d</p> <p>For Duggan, though, online interaction has helped make starting university less intimidating. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in group chats on Facebook, so we already know people without going to a lecture yet,\u201d says Duggan, who makes YouTube videos to take her mind off stress. \u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous coming to new places, so the uni\u2019s YouTube campus tours really helped.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince primary school, we\u2019ve been taught how to take care online,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in the same way as looking left and right before crossing the road.\u201d</p> <p>We head to the freshers\u2019 fair, which, depending on your personality, is a treasure trove of information and freebies or a sensory nightmare.

      "bodyText": "In the autumn of 1997, I was a fresher at the University of Glasgow. Months after the Labour landslide, weeks after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, I was an 18-year-old British-Indian made up of equal parts teenage kicks, terror and Topshop \u2013 and on my way to Scotland for the first time, to live and study in a city I had never even visited. I was a 90s Londoner in every sense: geographically ignorant, cocky, earnestly carrying a pager. North, to me, meant north of the Thames. Yet there I was, on a train nosing true north on the west coast mainline. At Euston station, I was waved off by my parents. I remember nothing of this momentous goodbye. In Carlisle, I felt a great sense of occasion because I thought we had crossed the border. By Motherwell, I was all grown up. In Glasgow, seeing the towering gothic spire of the fourth oldest university in the UK from my cab window, I thought it was the cathedral. When the driver informed me that it was, in fact, my university, I gasped. Had I even seen the prospectus? Twenty-two years later, I am on another train. Forty years old, less cocky, the pager replaced by a scratched Samsung A5, but once more on my way to my alma mater \u2013 as no one in Glasgow calls it. This time, I am heading west from Edinburgh: I never did go back to England. I am off to meet some freshers and do the things that freshers in 2019 do. Which is, according to my assumptions, drink less. Work more. Do more interacting on social media than freshers\u2019-flu-inducing socialising. Worry about the financial burden of a degree, an unstable job market, rent hikes, epidemic levels of sexual harassment on UK campuses, climate crisis, Brexit and whatever fresh hell is playing out in Westminster. My abiding sense is of a generation of young people carrying a lot more on their young shoulders than mine did. Many have voted in neither a general election nor a referendum, yet find themselves living in the most turbulent period of British history since well before their parents were born. On campus, at first glance, freshers\u2019 week is as it ever was. Crazy busy, strewn with Domino\u2019s branding (free pizza is being handed out at the main gate), soundtracked by tinny beats pumped out of who knows where, filled with a sea of friendly and daunted faces. The fashion, too, has come full circle: jeans, T-shirts, check shirts, trainers, a surfeit of blue- and pink-dyed hair. The front page of the university newspaper, the Glasgow Guardian, carries a splash about the university\u2019s \u00a33m investment in the arms trade, plus stories about tackling Glasgow stereotypes and where to get cheap cocktails. Wandering along University Avenue, I am offered a free bible, a copy of Socialist Worker and a flyer for pole-dancing classes. Plus \u00e7a change. In room 243 \u2013 found despite the directions \u201cbetween cloisters and south front\u201d that I still find incomprehensible \u2013 I meet the four freshers I will be hanging out with. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d says Nina Smith, 17, from Paisley, six miles south-west. \u201cBut it\u2019s a nice place to be lost.\u201d It is her first day and she is finding freshers\u2019 week \u201ca bit scary\u201d. Studying German and music, she works part-time in Ikea (16 hours a week, often jumping to 25) and is starting a shift at 5pm. All four students have a part-time job or are looking for one. When I started, the year before tuition fees were introduced UK-wide and at the tail end of grants, I worked only during the summer holidays, pulling pints in a pub back home, and it was for spending money, not to get by. Smith, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t even sure she was going to apply to university. What would she have done instead? \u201cI was thinking about taking a gap year and working full-time. Saving money. Then I thought: \u2018If I do that, I won\u2019t want to go to uni.\u2019\u201d Lewis Hannah, 17, is from Airdrie, to the east of Glasgow, and studying physics. Like Smith, he will be staying at home and commuting. \u201cAll my friends except one are staying at home,\u201d he says. The next day, after an Abba/Queen \u201cMassaoke\u201d night \u2013 in which a live band played the bands\u2019 hits and the lyrics were projected on to a giant screen for a singalong; you could attend only with a \u00a348 freshers\u2019 wristband \u2013 I phone to see how it went. \u201cThe union was packed. You could barely move.\u201d Was it fun? \u201cYeah, I was there until the end, about 2am.\u201d How did he get home? \u201cMy mum picked me up.\u201d Rachel Christie, 18, is the only one of the four staying in university accommodation. \u201cPerth is too far,\u201d she explains. What are her halls like? \u201cA bit overpriced,\u201d she says. \u201cI would have preferred private accommodation.\u201d Cooking for herself is \u201cOK, but the kitchen is a mess. No one cleans up after themselves. And my oven doesn\u2019t work.\u201d She concedes that it is good for meeting people. When I phone her the following day, to see how her night out at an Iyaz gig went, the social benefits of halls are clear. \u201cFirst I went to another flat with my friends and we drank there for a bit,\u201d she says. Is she hungover? \u201cNo, just a bit tired,\u201d she laughs. She and Hannah are the first people in their families to go to university. Three out of four of the group are part of the UK-wide Widening Participation programme, which aims to attract people who live in certain postcode areas; have been in care; have caring responsibilities, a disability or an impairment; or are estranged from family. Murrin Duggan, from outside Port Glasgow, 15 miles west of Glasgow, is one of a handful of 16-year-olds enrolling as a first-year undergraduate in 2019. She and Christie are studying French, Spanish and Portuguese. Although it is common for freshers to be 17 in Scotland, 16 is unusually young. Why did she come so early? \u201cWhen Brexit comes, we don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Duggan says. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I left school early. I just want to make sure I get into uni, because you never know. You might start getting charged for it, and it\u2019s quite a lot of money.\u201d \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have come if you had to pay for it,\u201d Christie adds. \u201cSame,\u201d says Smith. \u201cGo while you can.\u201d In Scotland, Scottish students get free university tuition, for which they have to re-apply each year. At Glasgow, half the students come from Scotland. I remember being struck not only by the university\u2019s Scottishness, but also how Glaswegian it was. It also felt very white, especially in the arts and humanities departments where I studied English literature and philosophy. Everyone tells me how radically different the university is now, which is clear from the multitude of languages I hear on campus. There are about 6,500 international students, 3,000 EU students and 1,300 European staff. How this might change after Brexit remains to be seen. \u201cEU students pay no tuition fees here,\u201d explains Rachel Sandison, a vice-principal at the university. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed us to welcome really high-quality European talent into Stem [science, technology, engineering and maths] subjects.\u201d The consequences of a no-deal Brexit, she says, would be \u201chuge\u201d. Memory is an unearthly form of archeology. I thought I remembered almost nothing of freshers\u2019 week, but when I got off the tube at Hillhead subway station in the West End I experienced what the novelist Muriel Spark described as \u201can inpouring of love\u201d for those intense days. The smell of hormones, disinfectant, cigarette smoke and club smoke machines. An excruciating traffic-light party at the GU union. (I wore amber.) The sound of Chumbawamba\u2019s Tubthumping everywhere. A poster fair where I bought a Steve McQueen still from Bullitt, even though I had never seen the film and didn\u2019t fancy its hypermasculine lead. What I really remember, though, is drinking. A lot. It felt like an expectation and really good fun. A 1997 freshers\u2019 guide sent to me by the archive department introduced the week as a \u201cpre-term drinking and entertainment extravaganza organised in your honour\u201d. One of the biggest changes in the two decades since I was a student is the way alcohol is perceived and consumed. According to a survey by University College London, 36% of 16- to 24-year-olds in full-time education abstain from drinking. \u201cI was a bit nervous, because I don\u2019t drink,\u201d says Duggan. \u201cBut I\u2019ve met a lot of people who don\u2019t drink, either. It\u2019s not what I expected.\u201d In the cloisters, after the surreal experience of stroking a pony with rainbow hair and a silver horn stuck to its forehead, we fight our way past a stall signing freshers up to six months\u2019 free Amazon Prime. In 1997, the internet amounted to sitting in front of a Netscape Navigator screen and pretending to \u201cdo\u201d the world wide web. None of the students I meet worry about online harassment. Yet, earlier this month, Dr Emma Short, the director of the National Centre for Cyberstalking Research at the University of Bedfordshire, said a watershed had been reached with the first generation of digital natives entering higher education. \u201cThe thresholds in universities for what has become normalised behaviour very often exceed criminal prosecution thresholds,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThings like persistent messaging, flooding messaging across platforms, pushing for DMs [direct messages]. The moment a person on the receiving end begins to feel fear and unease, you\u2019re in the realm of harassment. And students will tolerate much higher levels of risk than I would say are safe levels.\u201d For Duggan, though, online interaction has helped make starting university less intimidating. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in group chats on Facebook, so we already know people without going to a lecture yet,\u201d says Duggan, who makes YouTube videos to take her mind off stress. \u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous coming to new places, so the uni\u2019s YouTube campus tours really helped.\u201d \u201cSince primary school, we\u2019ve been taught how to take care online,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in the same way as looking left and right before crossing the road.\u201d We head to the freshers\u2019 fair, which, depending on your personality, is a treasure trove of information and freebies or a sensory nightmare. All the world is here, from Women in Stem to the Grim Reapers quidditch club. I can\u2019t remember attending it myself, but what is immediately apparent is the focus on what is referred to as \u201cthe student experience\u201d. In my time, this would have been a euphemism for sex, drugs and booze; now, it means mental health and wellbeing, among other things. When I was an undergraduate, if we were struggling, all the unspoken feelings spilled out as bravado and drunkenness \u2013 if you were lucky. If it got serious, it tended to be hushed up. Now, when one in five students has a mental health condition, the number of students seeking help has soared and mental health is at the top of the agenda. \u201cThere are unprecedented pressures on children and young adults that are flowing into universities,\u201d says John de Pury, the assistant director of policy at Universities UK. \u201cWe have to be exemplary in terms of care and inclusiveness.\u201d At Glasgow, where waiting times for assessment are nine days compared with the UK average of 52, all four freshers I speak to say they would not hesitate to tell someone if they were struggling. In the English literature department, I track down my old lecturer, Dr Vassiliki Kolocontroni, in her book-lined office. How does she think students have changed since she taught me? \u201cThe pressures are much greater now,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything is a lot more quantified.

C\u00e9sar Morales\u2019s Count Albrecht embodies aristo elegance, even as naive Giselle believes he\u2019s a peasant like her. He\u2019s an entitled, rules-don\u2019t-apply charmer, trying to pretend he\u2019s a man of the people. (Perhaps there are some modern political parallels after all.) Momoko Hirata, meanwhile, is a sweet, pure and guileless Giselle, her softness rubbing off on Albrecht.</p> <p>The supporting cast are impressive. Kit Holder manages to make his Hilarion seem like a real person, and his sympathetic presence provides an effective foil to the Count. And, as Giselle\u2019s mother, Marion Tait gives a masterclass in making small parts matter, nailing Albrecht with a stare that could stop time.</p> <p>Leading the vengeful wilis, Samara Downs is an imperious queen, channelling Claire Foy in The Crown: pursed, unimpressed, weighted with responsibility. There\u2019s no wafting around for this ghostly spirit. Her clan of wronged women follow suit, and, especially when the music is taken at businesslike pace, their implacability is pleasingly sinister.</p> <p>Act one has its lulls, but this is a production with some beautiful dancing: Hirata springing from the floor like a puppet on wires, hard to believe she\u2019s propelling herself; the poignantly slow pas de deux with repentant Albrecht. The mad scene pushes the right buttons, even if having Giselle stab herself does not seem as powerful as dying of a broken heart.</p> <p>This Giselle is not flashy, not trying to be relevant or shake things up. And it doesn\u2019t have the emotional transcendence of the great Giselles. But it is danced with diligence, attention and sensitivity. It may not go down in history, but it brings history alive in the present. </p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://theatreroyal.com/whats-on/brb-giselle/\">Theatre Royal Plymouth</a>, 23-25 October, and <a href=\"https://secure.sadlerswells.com/booking/production/syos/51378?utm_source=brb-website&amp;utm_medium=booking-page&amp;utm_campaign=brbgiselle19\">Sadler\u2019s Wells, London</a>, 1-2 November.</p>",

He\u2019s an entitled, rules-don\u2019t-apply charmer, trying to pretend he\u2019s a man of the people. (Perhaps there are some modern political parallels after all.) Momoko Hirata, meanwhile, is a sweet, pure and guileless Giselle, her softness rubbing off on Albrecht. The supporting cast are impressive. Kit Holder manages to make his Hilarion seem like a real person, and his sympathetic presence provides an effective foil to the Count. And, as Giselle\u2019s mother, Marion Tait gives a masterclass in making small parts matter, nailing Albrecht with a stare that could stop time. Leading the vengeful wilis, Samara Downs is an imperious queen, channelling Claire Foy in The Crown: pursed, unimpressed, weighted with responsibility. There\u2019s no wafting around for this ghostly spirit. Her clan of wronged women follow suit, and, especially when the music is taken at businesslike pace, their implacability is pleasingly sinister. Act one has its lulls, but this is a production with some beautiful dancing: Hirata springing from the floor like a puppet on wires, hard to believe she\u2019s propelling herself; the poignantly slow pas de deux with repentant Albrecht. The mad scene pushes the right buttons, even if having Giselle stab herself does not seem as powerful as dying of a broken heart. This Giselle is not flashy, not trying to be relevant or shake things up. And it doesn\u2019t have the emotional transcendence of the great Giselles. But it is danced with diligence, attention and sensitivity. It may not go down in history, but it brings history alive in the present. \u2022 At Theatre Royal Plymouth, 23-25 October, and Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 1-2 November.",

The latter falls in love, or reads Spinoza, and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other, or with the noise of the typewriter or the smell of cooking; in the mind of the poet these experiences are always forming new wholes.\u201d Whether such a process exists only in the heads of male poets (very doubtful, I think) or is fundamental to most memory-forming, this \u201camalgamation\u201d certainly seems to be present, swirling and fizzing somewhere in the deep wells where we haul out our poems. Poetry, after all, is much less \u201cabout\u201d a subject than a network of pathways through many subjects and in all directions but \u201cabout\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/tara-bergin\">Tara Bergin</a> provides an endnote in the collection where Drama Lessons for Young Girls appears, one that usefully cross-sections the poem to reveal her triad of sources. These were a visit to an exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum of classical sculpture, <a href=\"http://www.ianthearchitect.org/classical-gods-in-colour-at-th\">Gods in Colour</a><em>,</em> \u201ca news report on the failure of authorities in Oxfordshire to act on the claims of the abuse of young girls, and attending a lecture given by playwright <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/arts/interview-margaret-wilkinson-new-play-4402437\">Margaret Wilkinson</a> on how to read a script\u201d.</p> <p>Some ideas connect more immediately than others, but affinity doesn\u2019t make transformation easier. Two of Bergin\u2019s themes resonate with each other: the female statues in the Oxford museum who look as if they\u2019ve suffered abuse, and the contemporary girls living in the same county whose actual abuse has been covered up. What makes the connection so forceful, and lifts it entirely above the expected, are the interspersed sets of script-reading instructions.</p> <p>And yet there\u2019s no jarring disruption. Drama and ritual are implicit in the culture the sculptured girls represent, and the poem seems to suggest a botched religious ceremony, from which the girls\u2019 deity has absconded and where they suffer a mutilation that may have been ritual punishment. A small, vital hinge lies in the word \u201ccast\u201d. It occurs twice (lines six and 31) punningly connecting statues to actors (another fused antithesis). It\u2019s suggested that the girl we meet in line five was in fact a real girl who had only been cast \u201cas a young girl from the Acropolis\u201d.</p> <p>Because the girls are made to play parts, the story has to be read as an oblique feminist parable, in which they\u2019re damaged by gendered social expectations. The story is told crisply and simply, in a sometimes disingenuous tone, and the drama builds steadily, as the script-reading handbook advises, leaving much unsaid. The dramatic climax is in the sixth stanza, where, unexpectedly, \u201chundreds of girls come bleeding to the door\u201d.</p> <p>Athena has set her young girls an example of transgressive behaviour. She has run off with the wolves, recalling her part in the myth of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lycabettus\">Mount Lycabettus</a> and now the maidens are given new parts, \u201ccast as naughty young girls from the Acropolis\u201d, falsely accused and falsely chastised. The story reminds us that colour was the theme of the classical exhibition, and that its presence shocks our piety and aestheticism towards the past.

      "bodyText": "Drama Lessons for Young Girls Remember: in a stage play every scene is driven by OBJECTIVES. Every scene is driven by WHAT A CHARACTER WANTS. DRAMA is created when objectives clash. Here we see a young girl cast as a young girl from the Acropolis, moving elegantly forward, and carrying an offering in her outstretched hand. She is a figure in the act of worshipping. She is holding out her hand \u2013 but the outstretched hand is missing, and where it was is a stump of alabaster. And her nose and her chin are missing, and where they were are two stumps of alabaster. The lips are red, and the eyes are wide, so she still looks like a pretty girl. And her goddess is missing. Athena has run off with the wolves. They barked and howled and off she went. Where has she gone? What is it all meant to signify? Remember: in a stage play BAD DIALOGUE is expositional. Characters OFTEN LIE. They lie as a way of HIDING TRUTHS. And hundreds of girls came bleeding to the door! Their right hands outstretched! But the grown-ups pulled the grille, and said: you\u2019re naughty. So the young girls, cast as naughty young girls from the Acropolis, left \u2013 just with some things missing. Their lips were red and their eyes were wide, so they still looked like pretty girls. Remember this. When the stakes grow in intensity, it is known as BUILD. DELAY is a dramatic device. SUBTEXT is a character\u2019s DEEPEST SECRETS. For TS Eliot, poems were ignited by unexpected connections. He wrote: \u201cWhen a poet\u2019s mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it is constantly amalgamating disparate experience; the ordinary man\u2019s experience is chaotic, irregular, fragmentary. The latter falls in love, or reads Spinoza, and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other, or with the noise of the typewriter or the smell of cooking; in the mind of the poet these experiences are always forming new wholes.\u201d Whether such a process exists only in the heads of male poets (very doubtful, I think) or is fundamental to most memory-forming, this \u201camalgamation\u201d certainly seems to be present, swirling and fizzing somewhere in the deep wells where we haul out our poems. Poetry, after all, is much less \u201cabout\u201d a subject than a network of pathways through many subjects and in all directions but \u201cabout\u201d. Tara Bergin provides an endnote in the collection where Drama Lessons for Young Girls appears, one that usefully cross-sections the poem to reveal her triad of sources. These were a visit to an exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum of classical sculpture, Gods in Colour, \u201ca news report on the failure of authorities in Oxfordshire to act on the claims of the abuse of young girls, and attending a lecture given by playwright Margaret Wilkinson on how to read a script\u201d. Some ideas connect more immediately than others, but affinity doesn\u2019t make transformation easier. Two of Bergin\u2019s themes resonate with each other: the female statues in the Oxford museum who look as if they\u2019ve suffered abuse, and the contemporary girls living in the same county whose actual abuse has been covered up. What makes the connection so forceful, and lifts it entirely above the expected, are the interspersed sets of script-reading instructions. And yet there\u2019s no jarring disruption. Drama and ritual are implicit in the culture the sculptured girls represent, and the poem seems to suggest a botched religious ceremony, from which the girls\u2019 deity has absconded and where they suffer a mutilation that may have been ritual punishment. A small, vital hinge lies in the word \u201ccast\u201d. It occurs twice (lines six and 31) punningly connecting statues to actors (another fused antithesis). It\u2019s suggested that the girl we meet in line five was in fact a real girl who had only been cast \u201cas a young girl from the Acropolis\u201d. Because the girls are made to play parts, the story has to be read as an oblique feminist parable, in which they\u2019re damaged by gendered social expectations. The story is told crisply and simply, in a sometimes disingenuous tone, and the drama builds steadily, as the script-reading handbook advises, leaving much unsaid. The dramatic climax is in the sixth stanza, where, unexpectedly, \u201chundreds of girls come bleeding to the door\u201d. Athena has set her young girls an example of transgressive behaviour. She has run off with the wolves, recalling her part in the myth of Mount Lycabettus and now the maidens are given new parts, \u201ccast as naughty young girls from the Acropolis\u201d, falsely accused and falsely chastised. The story reminds us that colour was the theme of the classical exhibition, and that its presence shocks our piety and aestheticism towards the past. It reminds us of society\u2019s frequent preference for whitewash and silence when contemporary young women report abuse. Significantly, although mutilated and bleeding, the girls continue to succeed in looking like pretty girls. They are doubly miscast, in fact. The speaker\u2019s crisp, faintly didactic style leaves us in no doubt of the subtext. This dramatic monologue is angry but restrained, superbly controlled, coloured by the knowledge of terrible secrets. \u2022 Drama Lessons for Young Girls was first published in Granta 135, a special issue focused on New Irish Writing.

The 15 guests will include Pink Floyd hero <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/david-gilmour\">David Gilmour</a>, who has featured alongside Richard in a Rolling Stone magazine best ever guitarist list, and who, as a soloist, covered <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAQk3ZOeAXU\">Richard\u2019s 1975</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAQk3ZOeAXU\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAQk3ZOeAXU\">song Dimming of the Day</a>. \u201cHe\u2019ll do that,\u201d says Richard. \u201cAnd then do something of his \u2026 or Floyd\u2019s. He has always been a nice guy and we share a love of all things Fender.\u201d</p> <p>The cast will also include old and new British folk heroes, from <a href=\"http://alanbearmanmusic.co.uk/artists/martin-carthy-eliza-carthy/\">Martin and Eliza Carthy</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/10/diana-jones-olivia-chaney-review\">Olivia Chaney</a>. And then there will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/04/harry-shearer-simpsons-u-turn-interview\">Harry Shearer</a>, the American actor and comedian, reviving his role as Derek Smalls from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/spinal-tap-comedy\">Spinal Tap</a>, along with his wife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/09/judith-owen-mopping-up-karma\">Judith Owen</a> who joined Richard in 2006 for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/16/classicalmusicandopera2\">1,000 Years of Popular Music</a> project, in which they reworked anything from Sumer Is Icumen In to Britney Spears.</p> <p>Richard Thompson may be a virtuoso guitarist, but he insists that it\u2019s the songs that are most important to him. \u201cMost of what I do revolves around the song. If I play guitar, I\u2019m not interested in playing instrumentals. I like playing guitar to accompany a voice, or if there is a solo, then extending the narrative of the song.\u201d So are his thrilling, spontaneous-sounding acoustic or electric guitar solos inspired by the song? \u201cYes, it\u2019s that way round. Absolutely.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10750a8d38d4aef14f4a47a8d66fb7c843bde385\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10750a8d38d4aef14f4a47a8d66fb7c843bde385/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Thompson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Remarkable output \u2026 Richard Thompson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For more than 50 years, his songwriting output has been remarkable, from the gently bleak and lyrical ballads that are performed regularly in folk clubs (where some listeners probably think they are traditional) through to equally bleak, upbeat favourites like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKEPO_yB0fA\">Tear-Stained Letter</a> or the pounding, edgy and emotional stories of foreboding on his latest electric album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/12/richard-thompson-review-gawsworth-hall-macclesfield\">13 Rivers</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a set filled with religious imagery, \u201cbecause I love the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/21/king-james-bible-english-language\">King James Bible</a>, a beautiful piece of poetry, and you have to speak to people in a language that\u2019s familiar\u201d. And it was written, he says, \u201cin a difficult personal time\u201d. Last year, after the ending of his second marriage, to Nancy Covey, he quit California to move to New Jersey, home of his new partner, singer-songwriter and author <a href=\"http://www.zaraphillips.net/about-zara-phillips/zara-phillips-singer-songwriter-biography/\">Zara Phillips</a>. But he insists that the album is not autobiographical. \u201cI have no perspective on what I am doing. I write a song and think, \u2018Where does this come from?\u2019 Me? I wrote this? I write fiction \u2026 I\u2019m just enjoying myself, throwing lines together. I think it always reflects your own experience and feelings, but it isn\u2019t always in a way that\u2019s clear. If you find something honest enough in yourself then it will be universal.\u201d</p> <p>But The Storm Won\u2019t Come \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s a smell of death where I lay my head\u2026\u201d \u2013 is surely about his divorce? \u201cBut you\u2019ve also got Trump in the White House, so maybe there\u2019s a little bit of that in there as well.\u201d And Her Love Was Meant For Me, isn\u2019t that straightforward? \u201cIt\u2019s a song I find very confusing, actually.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt2a3WliLA4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xt2a3WliLA4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt2a3WliLA4\">Listen to The Storm Won\u2019t Come</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Richard insists that the Albert Hall show won\u2019t be a retrospective, but it will certainly be nostalgic.

Then there will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/8c775df2-15b5-449d-b669-2754229129af\">Simon Nicol</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ashleyhutchings.co.uk/\">Ashley Hutchings</a>, who along with Richard were the core trio in different teenage bands who evolved into the first Fairport Convention. They will be joined by <a href=\"https://www.davemattacks.com/\">Dave Mattacks</a>, the drummer who joined Fairport a little later, alongside the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/21/sandy-denny-ive-always-kept-a-unicorn-acoustic-cd-review\">Sandy Denny</a>, to record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/03/folk\">Liege and Lief</a>, the classic album released 50 years ago that kickstarted British folk-rock. \u201cWe might dip our toe into that repertoire,\u201d says Richard. \u201cAnd someone is going to do a bit of Sandy.\u201d</p> <p>So how did he feel about that era now? \u201cWe thought that if we are in the charts and it\u2019s taken seriously, it could change peoples\u2019 attitudes to British music and you might have people stopping using American accents when singing. It was totally revolutionary at the time. Rock music with an element of British traditional music in it was pretty much our innovation, and I\u2019m very proud of that. And when people in other countries saw we did, it was possible for them to contemporise their own cultures.\u201d</p> <p>After the Fairports, Richard recorded a serious of glorious, mostly bleak albums with his first wife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/10/linda-thomson-wont-be-long-review\">Linda Thompson</a>, a powerful, evocative singer whose career has been marred by dysphonia, a larynx disorder that makes it increasingly difficult for her to sing. She\u2019ll also be there, along with their musical children, singer-songwriter and producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/05/teddy-thompson-kelly-jones-musicians-little-windows\">Teddy Thompson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/10/the-rails-new-band-of-the-day\">Kami Thompson, who works with her husband, the Pretenders guitarist James Walbourne, in the Rails</a>.

And I like Zara. And Richard has changed has a lot. He is much nicer and he\u2019s happy \u2013 so that\u2019s great\u201d.</p> <p>It was during his marriage to Linda that Richard discovered Islam. The son of a Scottish policeman, he was brought up as a Presbyterian \u201cwhich I was not interested in. I became a Muslim when I was 23 and have been one ever since.\u201d He discovered Sufism, a mystical form of Islam, after visiting \u201c<a href=\"https://watkinsbooks.com/\">a very old esoteric bookshop, Watkins in Covent Garden</a>, and started reading about it\u201d. On the cover of their 1975 album <a href=\"https://mainlynorfolk.info/richard.thompson/records/pourdownlikesilver.html\">Pour Down Like Silver,</a> he and Linda are dressed in turban and headscarf, and for the next three years the couple disappeared from the music scene to spend much of their time in Islamic communities in London and then Norfolk. \u201cAnd it was a community, not a commune,\u201d said Richard. \u201cCommune implies sharing out the carrots!\u201d</p> <p>Linda hated it. \u201cSufism had appealed to me, but the guy who ran it was bit of a tyrant. There was lots of praying and guilt, and women were so subservient.\u201d Richard, who was attracted to Sufism by \u201cthe nobility of being \u2026 it seemed like the way human being should be,\u201d agreed that it wasn\u2019t ideal. \u201cIt was full of human foibles. People are lustful, jealous, God knows what. But then we visited a sheikh in Morocco and saw the other side of it. And it was all wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>By 1982 the marriage was at an end, but the deserved success of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZpzJ2KKss\">Shoot Out the Lights</a> album led to an infamous US tour. \u201cI was living on booze and antidepressants,\u201d Linda says. \u201cI was so angry I was kicking and hitting Richard on stage. I trashed a dressing room, stole a car and got arrested. But it was good for my voice. I guess because I was so heartbroken it freed me up. The dysphonia wasn\u2019t too bad in those days. At the end of the tour Richard rang and said: \u2018Bruce Springsteen is male singer of the year and you are female singer of the year.\u2019 Was it in Time or Rolling Stone? I think both. Like everything, good comes out of bad.\u201d</p> <p>So has she forgiven him? \u201cI have. It was a bad time but \u2013 Jesus Christ \u2013 it was 40 years ago. Forget it!\u201d But she is \u201ckind of dreading the Albert Hall\u201d because \u201cas a performer you\u2019d love to get up and wow the crowd, but I never know what will come out of my mouth. But I\u2019ll do something. It\u2019s going to be good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e2d3d8ff1ca46836db94dd2932dd631031b5494\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e2d3d8ff1ca46836db94dd2932dd631031b5494/0_0_1904_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard and Linda Thompson in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard and Linda Thompson in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the split, Richard moved to California, remarried, and relaunched his career. \u201cAt aged 33, when I started singing solo, they treated me as a new artist and put me on college radio. So my audience in the States was 10 years younger than me, and it still is. And very, very slowly I did well. It was word of mouth. I toured America relentlessly, and I still do, and it\u2019s still growing, which is amazing. Without having a hit record, more people come to shows now than they ever did.\u201d As for the move to the east coast, \u201cI was ready for a change. But being a performing musician I do 100 shows a year, and I\u2019m away 150 days, so where you are based is less important.\u201d</p> <p>Does he have problems as a Muslim living in the States in the Trump era? \u201cTrump has ramped up bigotry considerably.

      "bodyText": "Richard Thompson is drinking mint tea in a Hampstead coffee shop \u2013 he doesn\u2019t touch coffee or alcohol \u2013 and between Islam and cricket, he\u2019s discussing the remarkable guest list for his upcoming 70th birthday celebration at the Royal Albert Hall in London. \u201cI don\u2019t like being the centre of attention, strange as it sounds,\u201d he insists. \u201cI just want to have a few friends over.\u201d The man the LA Times once hailed as \u201cthe finest rock songwriter after Dylan\u201d and \u201cthe best electric guitarist since Hendrix\u201d will switch between electric and acoustic guitars, and hopes that \u201cmost guests will have time to do a couple of songs\u201d. The 15 guests will include Pink Floyd hero David Gilmour, who has featured alongside Richard in a Rolling Stone magazine best ever guitarist list, and who, as a soloist, covered Richard\u2019s 1975 song Dimming of the Day. \u201cHe\u2019ll do that,\u201d says Richard. \u201cAnd then do something of his \u2026 or Floyd\u2019s. He has always been a nice guy and we share a love of all things Fender.\u201d The cast will also include old and new British folk heroes, from Martin and Eliza Carthy to Olivia Chaney. And then there will be Harry Shearer, the American actor and comedian, reviving his role as Derek Smalls from Spinal Tap, along with his wife Judith Owen who joined Richard in 2006 for the 1,000 Years of Popular Music project, in which they reworked anything from Sumer Is Icumen In to Britney Spears. Richard Thompson may be a virtuoso guitarist, but he insists that it\u2019s the songs that are most important to him. \u201cMost of what I do revolves around the song. If I play guitar, I\u2019m not interested in playing instrumentals. I like playing guitar to accompany a voice, or if there is a solo, then extending the narrative of the song.\u201d So are his thrilling, spontaneous-sounding acoustic or electric guitar solos inspired by the song? \u201cYes, it\u2019s that way round. Absolutely.\u201d For more than 50 years, his songwriting output has been remarkable, from the gently bleak and lyrical ballads that are performed regularly in folk clubs (where some listeners probably think they are traditional) through to equally bleak, upbeat favourites like Tear-Stained Letter or the pounding, edgy and emotional stories of foreboding on his latest electric album, 13 Rivers. It\u2019s a set filled with religious imagery, \u201cbecause I love the King James Bible, a beautiful piece of poetry, and you have to speak to people in a language that\u2019s familiar\u201d. And it was written, he says, \u201cin a difficult personal time\u201d. Last year, after the ending of his second marriage, to Nancy Covey, he quit California to move to New Jersey, home of his new partner, singer-songwriter and author Zara Phillips. But he insists that the album is not autobiographical. \u201cI have no perspective on what I am doing. I write a song and think, \u2018Where does this come from?\u2019 Me? I wrote this? I write fiction \u2026 I\u2019m just enjoying myself, throwing lines together. I think it always reflects your own experience and feelings, but it isn\u2019t always in a way that\u2019s clear. If you find something honest enough in yourself then it will be universal.\u201d But The Storm Won\u2019t Come \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s a smell of death where I lay my head\u2026\u201d \u2013 is surely about his divorce? \u201cBut you\u2019ve also got Trump in the White House, so maybe there\u2019s a little bit of that in there as well.\u201d And Her Love Was Meant For Me, isn\u2019t that straightforward? \u201cIt\u2019s a song I find very confusing, actually.\u201d Richard insists that the Albert Hall show won\u2019t be a retrospective, but it will certainly be nostalgic. Another guest will be Hugh Cornwell, of Stranglers fame, who played with Richard in his first band, Emil &amp; the Detectives, when they were both 14 and pupils at William Ellis school near Hampstead Heath. Then there will Simon Nicol and Ashley Hutchings, who along with Richard were the core trio in different teenage bands who evolved into the first Fairport Convention. They will be joined by Dave Mattacks, the drummer who joined Fairport a little later, alongside the late Sandy Denny, to record Liege and Lief, the classic album released 50 years ago that kickstarted British folk-rock. \u201cWe might dip our toe into that repertoire,\u201d says Richard. \u201cAnd someone is going to do a bit of Sandy.\u201d So how did he feel about that era now? \u201cWe thought that if we are in the charts and it\u2019s taken seriously, it could change peoples\u2019 attitudes to British music and you might have people stopping using American accents when singing. It was totally revolutionary at the time. Rock music with an element of British traditional music in it was pretty much our innovation, and I\u2019m very proud of that. And when people in other countries saw we did, it was possible for them to contemporise their own cultures.\u201d After the Fairports, Richard recorded a serious of glorious, mostly bleak albums with his first wife Linda Thompson, a powerful, evocative singer whose career has been marred by dysphonia, a larynx disorder that makes it increasingly difficult for her to sing. She\u2019ll also be there, along with their musical children, singer-songwriter and producer Teddy Thompson and Kami Thompson, who works with her husband, the Pretenders guitarist James Walbourne, in the Rails. And to complete the family line-up there will Richard\u2019s new partner Zara Phillips. So how would Linda feel if Zara sings one of the Richard and Linda classics such as I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight or Wall of Death, as seems likely? \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t seem odd,\u201d Linda tells me. \u201cIf it were Richard and Emmylou Harris I might be a bit miffed, because she is a genius! And I like Zara. And Richard has changed has a lot. He is much nicer and he\u2019s happy \u2013 so that\u2019s great\u201d. It was during his marriage to Linda that Richard discovered Islam. The son of a Scottish policeman, he was brought up as a Presbyterian \u201cwhich I was not interested in. I became a Muslim when I was 23 and have been one ever since.\u201d He discovered Sufism, a mystical form of Islam, after visiting \u201ca very old esoteric bookshop, Watkins in Covent Garden, and started reading about it\u201d. On the cover of their 1975 album Pour Down Like Silver, he and Linda are dressed in turban and headscarf, and for the next three years the couple disappeared from the music scene to spend much of their time in Islamic communities in London and then Norfolk. \u201cAnd it was a community, not a commune,\u201d said Richard. \u201cCommune implies sharing out the carrots!\u201d Linda hated it. \u201cSufism had appealed to me, but the guy who ran it was bit of a tyrant. There was lots of praying and guilt, and women were so subservient.\u201d Richard, who was attracted to Sufism by \u201cthe nobility of being \u2026 it seemed like the way human being should be,\u201d agreed that it wasn\u2019t ideal. \u201cIt was full of human foibles. People are lustful, jealous, God knows what. But then we visited a sheikh in Morocco and saw the other side of it. And it was all wonderful.\u201d By 1982 the marriage was at an end, but the deserved success of the Shoot Out the Lights album led to an infamous US tour. \u201cI was living on booze and antidepressants,\u201d Linda says. \u201cI was so angry I was kicking and hitting Richard on stage. I trashed a dressing room, stole a car and got arrested. But it was good for my voice. I guess because I was so heartbroken it freed me up. The dysphonia wasn\u2019t too bad in those days. At the end of the tour Richard rang and said: \u2018Bruce Springsteen is male singer of the year and you are female singer of the year.\u2019 Was it in Time or Rolling Stone? I think both. Like everything, good comes out of bad.\u201d So has she forgiven him? \u201cI have. It was a bad time but \u2013 Jesus Christ \u2013 it was 40 years ago. Forget it!\u201d But she is \u201ckind of dreading the Albert Hall\u201d because \u201cas a performer you\u2019d love to get up and wow the crowd, but I never know what will come out of my mouth. But I\u2019ll do something. It\u2019s going to be good.\u201d After the split, Richard moved to California, remarried, and relaunched his career. \u201cAt aged 33, when I started singing solo, they treated me as a new artist and put me on college radio. So my audience in the States was 10 years younger than me, and it still is. And very, very slowly I did well. It was word of mouth. I toured America relentlessly, and I still do, and it\u2019s still growing, which is amazing. Without having a hit record, more people come to shows now than they ever did.\u201d As for the move to the east coast, \u201cI was ready for a change. But being a performing musician I do 100 shows a year, and I\u2019m away 150 days, so where you are based is less important.\u201d Does he have problems as a Muslim living in the States in the Trump era? \u201cTrump has ramped up bigotry considerably. If you are not a white Christian, the implication is that you\u2019re not a real American. It\u2019s incredibly destructive, divisive, and harmful. We\u2019ll see how it plays out \u2013 but the fact is that you still have more religious freedom in America or Britain than you do in a whole lot of Middle Eastern countries.\u201d Thompson is a cricket enthusiast \u2013 he cheerfully recalls his appearance on Test Match Special five years ago, singing 1952 Vincent Black Lightning \u2013 and he insists he \u201cnever wanted to be culturally absorbed by America. I can contribute more having a culturally British point of view.\u201d Even in the midwest, he can still knock them for six. \u2022 Richard Thompson: 70th Birthday Celebration is at Royal Albert Hall, London, Monday 30 September.",

Not to mention his zeitgeisty TV series: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/eight-years-after-it-finished-why-is-lost-being-reappraised\">Lost</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld\">Westworld</a> and Alias. Unsurprisingly, everybody wants him.</p> <p>Last week, we found out just how much: Abrams\u2019s company Bad Robot <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jj-abrams-officially-closes-sizable-warnermedia-film-tv-partnership-1232979\">signed a $250m \u201cmega-deal\u201d</a> to produce film, TV and digital content for WarnerMedia. Apple reportedly offered him double that but he went with Warner. This immediately lit up lightbulbs in one quadrant of the fan galaxy: Warner is the home of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dc-comics\">DC Comics</a>\u2019 superheroes. For DC fans, the coming of Abrams would be like hearing your athletics team has just signed the Flash.</p> <p>As we know, Marvel has stolen a march on its comic-book rivals over the past decade with its well-planned and spectacularly successful movie cycle. DC has floundered in its efforts to catch up, including the unloved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/27/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-observer-review\">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/15/justice-league-ben-affleck-dc-comics\">Justice League</a>.

      "bodyText": "It is JJ Abrams\u2019s multiverse; we just live in it. That\u2019s how it\u2019s starting to feel, at least. The prolific producer-director-writer-geek overlord has had a hand in so many pop-culture properties over the past decade, it feels like he has basically won Hollywood. Star Wars (he\u2019s finishing off Episode IX right now), Star Trek, Mission Impossible \u2013 all have benefited from the Abrams touch. Not to mention his zeitgeisty TV series: Lost, Westworld and Alias. Unsurprisingly, everybody wants him. Last week, we found out just how much: Abrams\u2019s company Bad Robot signed a $250m \u201cmega-deal\u201d to produce film, TV and digital content for WarnerMedia. Apple reportedly offered him double that but he went with Warner. This immediately lit up lightbulbs in one quadrant of the fan galaxy: Warner is the home of DC Comics\u2019 superheroes. For DC fans, the coming of Abrams would be like hearing your athletics team has just signed the Flash. As we know, Marvel has stolen a march on its comic-book rivals over the past decade with its well-planned and spectacularly successful movie cycle. DC has floundered in its efforts to catch up, including the unloved Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League. Recent hits such as Wonder Woman and Aquaman have steadied the ship, but there is the impression that no one is in overall control, like Kevin Feige has been at Marvel. Abrams would fit that bill perfectly. In addition, his old friend Matt Reeves is already working on the new Robert Pattinson Batman movie. So it could all fit together. But how much of the Abrams touch is too much? Of course, he is a consummate entertainer, with a Spielberg-like sense of how to please the crowd, orchestrate the spectacle and set the tone just right. And he knows how to bring in new audiences while keeping the old fans on board. Look how he cleverly sheared off a new timeline with Star Trek, leaving the original canon intact.

He is one of the five most impactful, consistent defenders on one of the top-10 defenses in the league. Through four weeks of the 2019 season he has played 100% of the team\u2019s defensive snaps. His head coach, Ron Rivera, one of the sharpest defensive minds in the league, has built a defensive scheme with Reid as one of its tentpoles \u2013 he is as important as the team\u2019s other defensive stars, Luke Kuechly, James Bradberry and Gerald McCoy.</p> <p>And, besides, are Reid\u2019s storylines any more of a distraction than the <a href=\"https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/carolina-panthers-to-star-in-all-or-nothing-on-amazon\">Panthers\u2019 run on a behind-the-scenes documentary?</a> Or <a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers/article235295427.html\">star quarterback Cam Newton\u2019s new vegan diet</a>?

      "bodyText": "Why Eric Reid wasn\u2019t playing football at the start of 2018 was as obvious to his detractors as anyone. But with each passing week, with each snap, with each dynamic swoop to close on a quarterback or break up a pass, that eight-month stretch out of the NFL takes on a darker, more sinister tone. To recap, Reid knelt alongside his friend Colin Kaepernick in 2016 when they played together at the San Francisco 49ers. And, just like Kaepernick, he soon found himself without a job despite being a solid pro and in the prime years of his career. Detractors hit Reid with the same nonsense that they used to justify Kaepernick\u2019s exile. A rebuke of his political beliefs dressed up as football commentary: he couldn\u2019t find a team because he wasn\u2019t very good; players of his type, at his position, were dying out; he would be a distraction. Unlike Kaepernick Reid eventually found a team willing to take him on \u2013 he signed for the Carolina Panthers four months after filing a grievance against the NFL alleging teams colluded to keep him out of the league. Reid plays at safety and teams want linebacker-safety hybrids, guys who are comfortable playing the run and turning and running in coverage. Reid is the prototype. And, in some ways, Reid has been a distraction. He speaks freely and openly about politics, and continues to kneel for the anthem. He has accused \u2013 with some justification \u2013 the NFL of singling him out for drug tests. He has got into a pre-game scuffle with another player campaigning for social justice, Malcolm Jenkins. And guess what: Reid\u2019s on-field play continues to make a mockery of fears about those distractions.

Or whether this is Newton\u2019s last year in Charlotte or not? Sunday saw Reid\u2019s best performance of the season so far, his best since his return.

With the exception of Kevin De Bruyne it is hard to find a midfielder in better form and he certainly deserved to be on the winning side here, when Aston Villa were eventually pegged back by Burnley. \u201cHe\u2019s been consistently good in all our performances and consistently looks like he\u2019s going to score goals,\u201d said McGinn\u2019s manager, Dean Smith, after he volleyed in Villa\u2019s second having earlier had a strike ruled out by VAR. \u201cHe\u2019s an all-action player, gets into the opposition box, scores goals, wins free-kicks.\u201d McGinn has an unorthodox running style but seems to cover every blade of grass while offering a constant creative threat: his rise has been quite something and the list of admirers will surely be growing. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/aston-villa-burnley-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Aston Villa 2-2 Burnley</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/manchester-united-arsenal-match-preview\">Manchester United v Arsenal: match preview</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>2) Yarmolenko makes major impact</h2> \n<p>Manuel Pellegrini stopped short of describing Andriy Yarmolenko as like a new signing but there is no masking the impact the Ukraine winger has made since returning from almost a year out through injury. Yarmolenko provides West Ham with another welcome touch of class in the attacking third, where Pellegrini already has a wealth of options: the fit-again Manuel Lanzini, Felipe Anderson, Pablo Fornals and Jack Wilshere. \u201cHe [Yarmolenko] is carrying us at times,\u201d said Ryan Fredericks. \u201cWe want to give him the ball as much as possible. He\u2019s a little bit different. Unpredictable.\u201d Recent evidence, namely goals against Manchester United and Bournemouth, suggests Yarmolenko could propel high-flying West Ham towards the top-seven finish they crave. \u201cWe\u2019re a different team, a different beast this season,\u201d Fredericks said. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/bournemouth-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Bournemouth 2-2 West Ham</a></em></p> \n<h2>3) Abraham improves despite firing blanks</h2> \n<p>After scoring seven goals in three games Tammy Abraham has none in his past three outings for Chelsea. He struggled in the defeat by Valencia in the Champions League, lost a battle of wits with Adri\u00e1n when he went through against Liverpool last week and had a frustrating afternoon in the win over Brighton on Saturday, spurning several opportunities in both halves. Instead of dwelling on the misses, however, let us focus on the positives. For a start Abraham has the knack of getting into goalscoring positions. But what of his ability to lead the line? It is not enough for a striker to be a mere poacher these days. They have to work for the team and Abraham showed he is improving in that area against Brighton, whose defenders struggled to live with his pace, strength and intelligence. His finishing might have been off but he did not have a bad game. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/chelsea-brighton-hove-albion-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea 2-0 Brighton</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b4d336a123aafa203b71aee6b615bc6d38f970b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b4d336a123aafa203b71aee6b615bc6d38f970b/0_79_4556_2735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tammy Abraham is improving his all-round game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tammy Abraham is improving his all-round game.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Palace looking safe and secure</h2> \n<p>In a season when clean sheets have been something of a rarity, Crystal Palace\u2019s three from seven matches \u2013 the joint-highest along with West Ham and Manchester City \u2013 is a testament to their defensive strength in depth. Gary Cahill has proved to be a shrewd acquisition for the club, while Mamadou Sakho, James Tomkins, Martin Kelly and Scott Dann give Roy Hodgson several options at the back. The manager said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great pity that we don\u2019t have quite that luxury in other areas which I think would help us enormously if we had that. But I\u2019m still hoping from the club\u2019s point of view I hope that can be put right in January.\u201d Having previously struggled at Selhurst Park, Palace are on their longest unbeaten home run since 1993 but face City, Leicester and Liverpool in their next three. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/crystal-palace-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace 2-0 Norwich</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/29/jurgen-klopp-winning-run-uninterested-numbers-wilder-champagne\">Liverpool\u2019s appetite for hard graft keeps J\u00fcrgen Klopp happy | Richard Jolly</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>5) Everton\u2019s Silva lining</h2> \n<p>Everton have now lost three consecutive Premier League matches and on travelling to Burnley on Saturday will have not collected a point in the competition for more than a month. Marco Silva\u2019s team did, though, trouble Manchester City and Silva, for one, remains confident about Everton\u2019s prospects for the season as he hailed the supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t have doubts. I think they [fans] go home with that bad feeling when we don\u2019t get a result,\u201d said the manager. \u201cIn the dressing room they had the same feeling. But I said to them, if we have this desire and attitude we will get the results. It will not always go like this. Football is like that, you know. It\u2019s up to us to keep working. But they went home after an ovation for the players. It is important for sure that they will be there again at Burnley to support us and we must show the desire again.\u201d <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>6) Fernandinho no more than stopgap</h2> \n<p>Since he arrived at Manchester City Fernandinho has received almost universal praise, but he was twice at fault for Everton\u2019s equaliser. Playing as a centre-back in Pep Guardiola\u2019s makeshift defence, the Brazilian fluffed an attempted clearance of Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s cross then put in a weak tackle on Alex Iwobi to allow S\u00e9amus Coleman to set up Dominic Calvert-Lewin. He is a superbly combative and elegant midfielder, whose ability to control midfield and protect the defence has been as fundamental to City\u2019s success as Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s artistry or Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s ruthlessness, but he is quite simply not a defender. City have been unlucky that injuries have struck down Aymeric Laporte and John Stones but square pegs in round holes will not cut it. Not with Liverpool in this form. <strong>Rob Bleaney</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/everton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Everton 1-3 Manchester City</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/29/riyad-mahrez-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-everton\">Pep Guardiola hails Riyad Mahrez\u2019s form for Manchester City after goal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>7) Rodgers will savour Anfield return</h2> \n<p>Well, there is no stopping Leicester. Presented with a tiring and vulnerable opposition, they went clean through Newcastle. Some teams may have relaxed at 3-0 but Brendan Rodgers\u2019s men hammered away at the open door that was Newcastle\u2019s defence and were not flattered by the margin of victory. Leicester are up to third place. Is that courtesy of a generous start to their fixtures? Maybe. They have taken one point from games at Old Trafford and Chelsea. Up next on Saturday is Liverpool, at Anfield, a game Leicester drew last season and one Rodgers will savour. Should he go on the front foot, he will want Jamie Vardy to hustle and hassle Virgil van Dijk and James Maddison to be fit. He did not face Newcastle but Rodgers said after this win his star turn in midfield should be in contention. He will dearly love that to be the case. <strong>Conrad Leach</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: Leicester 5-0 Newcastle</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77134869-46ee-4ad5-896e-cf1f6a905f8b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YNkva8WrhJc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>8) Wilder favours tough love</h2> \n<p>Chris Wilder was unsympathetic towards Dean Henderson after the goalkeeper\u2019s error provided Georginio Wijnaldum\u2019s winner. He also conjured an odd image. \u201cI am not going to put my arm around him and rub his head,\u201d the Sheffield United manager said. Henderson may not be daunted \u2013 George Baldock described him as confident three times in swift succession \u2013 but Wilder hopes a reaction will not be required by a man the Blades deem a future England keeper. \u201cHe made a huge one last year against Leeds and came back and he made a couple in a high-profile Championship game against Aston Villa and came back but I don\u2019t want him to make mistakes,\u201d the manager said. \u201cFor all the top goalkeepers mistakes are very few and far between. He is an outstanding young goalkeeper but a lot will be down to how he takes it on. This is a big season for him. It is up to him how he develops.\u201d <strong>Richard Jolly</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/sheffield-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sheffield United 0-1 Liverpool</a></em></p> \n<h2>9) Ndombele off to promising start</h2> \n<p>One of the criticisms of Tanguy Ndombele at Lyon was his goals output. In 66 Ligue 1 appearances for the club he scored once. He knew himself that he needed to be more productive at Tottenham and so a second goal in five Premier League games was something to be happy about. What caught the eye about the midfielder\u2019s performance against Southampton were the traits that convinced Spurs to part with a club-record fee of \u00a355m in the summer \u2013 the driving, direct runs past opponents and the quick, incisive passes and flicks to get his team moving. These are early days and Ndombele needs more time to come to terms with the remorselessness of English football but he showed on Saturday that the raw materials are there. The search for consistency will define his season. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/tottenham-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham 2-1 Southampton</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/28/granit-xhaka-arsenal-personality-captain\">Personality alone cannot make Granit Xhaka the leader Arsenal crave</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>10) Dashing Traor\u00e9 adds guile</h2> \n<p>Let us talk about Adama Traor\u00e9 again. The Wolves player is a source of fascination for many, partly because of his heritage \u2013 he grew up in Barcelona\u2019s La Masla \u2013 but also his natural attributes, particularly his searing pace. The question of how to maximise those abilities has come into extra focus this season after Wolves moved on some of their forward players, giving Traor\u00e9 a more prominent role. At points he has played as a wing-back but in recent games Nuno Espirito Santo has switched to a 3-4-3 and Traor\u00e9 is back in his favoured advanced position. Against Watford he was very effective but in a surprising way. Yes, there were exhilarating dashes down the wing and also those dribbled bursts of close control. But Traor\u00e9 used another weapon, too \u2013 his passing was often excellent, with his pre-assist for Wolves\u2019 decisive second goal the pick. Substituted late on, it was with a sense of job done. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a

Gary Cahill has proved to be a shrewd acquisition for the club, while Mamadou Sakho, James Tomkins, Martin Kelly and Scott Dann give Roy Hodgson several options at the back. The manager said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great pity that we don\u2019t have quite that luxury in other areas which I think would help us enormously if we had that. But I\u2019m still hoping from the club\u2019s point of view I hope that can be put right in January.\u201d Having previously struggled at Selhurst Park, Palace are on their longest unbeaten home run since 1993 but face City, Leicester and Liverpool in their next three. Ed Aarons \u2022 Match report: Crystal Palace 2-0 Norwich 5) Everton\u2019s Silva lining Everton have now lost three consecutive Premier League matches and on travelling to Burnley on Saturday will have not collected a point in the competition for more than a month. Marco Silva\u2019s team did, though, trouble Manchester City and Silva, for one, remains confident about Everton\u2019s prospects for the season as he hailed the supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t have doubts. I think they [fans] go home with that bad feeling when we don\u2019t get a result,\u201d said the manager. \u201cIn the dressing room they had the same feeling. But I said to them, if we have this desire and attitude we will get the results. It will not always go like this. Football is like that, you know. It\u2019s up to us to keep working. But they went home after an ovation for the players. It is important for sure that they will be there again at Burnley to support us and we must show the desire again.\u201d Jamie Jackson 6) Fernandinho no more than stopgap Since he arrived at Manchester City Fernandinho has received almost universal praise, but he was twice at fault for Everton\u2019s equaliser. Playing as a centre-back in Pep Guardiola\u2019s makeshift defence, the Brazilian fluffed an attempted clearance of Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s cross then put in a weak tackle on Alex Iwobi to allow S\u00e9amus Coleman to set up Dominic Calvert-Lewin. He is a superbly combative and elegant midfielder, whose ability to control midfield and protect the defence has been as fundamental to City\u2019s success as Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s artistry or Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s ruthlessness, but he is quite simply not a defender. City have been unlucky that injuries have struck down Aymeric Laporte and John Stones but square pegs in round holes will not cut it. Not with Liverpool in this form. Rob Bleaney \u2022 Match report: Everton 1-3 Manchester City 7) Rodgers will savour Anfield return Well, there is no stopping Leicester. Presented with a tiring and vulnerable opposition, they went clean through Newcastle. Some teams may have relaxed at 3-0 but Brendan Rodgers\u2019s men hammered away at the open door that was Newcastle\u2019s defence and were not flattered by the margin of victory. Leicester are up to third place. Is that courtesy of a generous start to their fixtures? Maybe. They have taken one point from games at Old Trafford and Chelsea. Up next on Saturday is Liverpool, at Anfield, a game Leicester drew last season and one Rodgers will savour. Should he go on the front foot, he will want Jamie Vardy to hustle and hassle Virgil van Dijk and James Maddison to be fit. He did not face Newcastle but Rodgers said after this win his star turn in midfield should be in contention. He will dearly love that to be the case. Conrad Leach \u2022 Match report: Leicester 5-0 Newcastle 8) Wilder favours tough love Chris Wilder was unsympathetic towards Dean Henderson after the goalkeeper\u2019s error provided Georginio Wijnaldum\u2019s winner. He also conjured an odd image. \u201cI am not going to put my arm around him and rub his head,\u201d the Sheffield United manager said. Henderson may not be daunted \u2013 George Baldock described him as confident three times in swift succession \u2013 but Wilder hopes a reaction will not be required by a man the Blades deem a future England keeper. \u201cHe made a huge one last year against Leeds and came back and he made a couple in a high-profile Championship game against Aston Villa and came back but I don\u2019t want him to make mistakes,\u201d the manager said. \u201cFor all the top goalkeepers mistakes are very few and far between. He is an outstanding young goalkeeper but a lot will be down to how he takes it on. This is a big season for him. It is up to him how he develops.\u201d Richard Jolly \u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 0-1 Liverpool 9) Ndombele off to promising start One of the criticisms of Tanguy Ndombele at Lyon was his goals output. In 66 Ligue 1 appearances for the club he scored once. He knew himself that he needed to be more productive at Tottenham and so a second goal in five Premier League games was something to be happy about. What caught the eye about the midfielder\u2019s performance against Southampton were the traits that convinced Spurs to part with a club-record fee of \u00a355m in the summer \u2013 the driving, direct runs past opponents and the quick, incisive passes and flicks to get his team moving. These are early days and Ndombele needs more time to come to terms with the remorselessness of English football but he showed on Saturday that the raw materials are there. The search for consistency will define his season. David Hytner \u2022 Match report: Tottenham 2-1 Southampton 10) Dashing Traor\u00e9 adds guile Let us talk about Adama Traor\u00e9 again. The Wolves player is a source of fascination for many, partly because of his heritage \u2013 he grew up in Barcelona\u2019s La Masla \u2013 but also his natural attributes, particularly his searing pace. The question of how to maximise those abilities has come into extra focus this season after Wolves moved on some of their forward players, giving Traor\u00e9 a more prominent role. At points he has played as a wing-back but in recent games Nuno Espirito Santo has switched to a 3-4-3 and Traor\u00e9 is back in his favoured advanced position. Against Watford he was very effective but in a surprising way. Yes, there were exhilarating dashes down the wing and also those dribbled bursts of close control. But Traor\u00e9 used another weapon, too \u2013 his passing was often excellent, with his pre-assist for Wolves\u2019 decisive second goal the pick. Substituted late on, it was with a sense of job done. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: Wolves 2-0 Watford",

      "bodyText": "Key provisions of the religious discrimination bill may be unconstitutional because they allow medical practitioners to refuse treatment, and privilege statements of religious belief, an academic has warned. Luke Beck, a constitutional and religious freedom expert at Monash University, warned the Coalition\u2019s exposure draft bill may be incompatible with international law and therefore not supported by the external affairs power in the constitution. The submission echoes concerns from the Australian Human Rights Commission and Public Interest Advocacy Centre that the bill will licence discriminatory statements about race, sexual orientation and disability on the grounds of religion, and that it privileges religion over other rights. The bill has been criticised for overriding state and federal discrimination law, including section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which prohibits speech that offends, insults or humiliates people based on race. Beck argued the bill provided a \u201cbigger sword\u201d to religious people\u2019s statements of belief than those of non-religious people. Statements of belief can be made \u201con any topic whatsoever\u201d provided they \u201cmay reasonably be regarded\u201d as in accordance with a person\u2019s religious beliefs. By contrast, statements of non-belief must deal only with the topic of religion and \u201carise directly\u201d from the fact the person does not hold a religious belief, the associate professor said. Beck argued the different standard might breach the international law requiring \u201cequal footing\u201d to be given to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Because the bill relies on the external affairs power for its validity there was \u201csignificant constitutional doubt\u201d about the provisions, he said. Beck and the Public Interest Advocacy Centre (Piac), in separate submissions, also criticised the bill\u2019s attempt to give health practitioners a right to refuse to provide services if the refusal is motivated by the practitioner\u2019s religious beliefs. Piac noted the provision was not limited to procedures such as abortion and euthanasia, meaning it could \u201cprotect the outright refusal of services to people from certain groups\u201d by \u201ca long list of health professions, including occupational therapy, optometry, pharmacy and podiatry\u201d. The chief executive of Piac, Jonathon Hunyor, told Guardian Australia the bill \u201cclearly and deliberately\u201d privileged religion over other rights, particularly in the statement of belief provisions. Beck and Piac argued the provision would allow people to denounce single mothers, trans people, people with a disability or of different faiths, provided they invoked God or described their targets as sinners. Piac said the bill would fracture the existing regime which lets states set their own laws, which would constitute \u201ca radical and unwarranted step\u201d. The AHRC submitted that \u201coverriding \u2026 all other Australian discrimination laws is not warranted, sets a concerning precedent, and is inconsistent with the stated objects of the bill\u201d. Rather than recognise the indivisibility and universality of human rights, the provision \u201cseeks to favour one right over all others\u201d. Both Beck and the AHRC raised the spectre of discrimination complaints made under state law being forced into expensive litigation in federal courts because low-cost state tribunals lack jurisdiction to adjudicate on the clash of federal and state law. The AHRC endorsed the elements of the bill that protect against discrimination on the grounds of religion where the law is equivalent to existing federal protections for race, sex, disability and age. But it warned against \u201cunique provisions that have no counterpart in other anti-discrimination laws and appear to be designed to address high-profile individual cases\u201d. The bill bans employers from setting codes of conduct that indirectly discriminate on the grounds of religion, which attorney general Christian Porter has said will provide protection for people such as Israel Folau, who was sacked by Rugby Australia for social media posts claiming homosexuals will go to hell. Large employers \u2013 with a turnover of $50m or more \u2013 can escape the ban only if their code of conduct is both reasonable and necessary to avoid \u201cunjustifiable financial hardship\u201d. The AHRC questioned the \u201cimplicit assumption\u201d that financial considerations were the only legitimate reason to set a code of conduct, and why it would not be open to an employer to show it was \u201cnecessary to promote the values or ethos of the company or to prevent discrimination\u201d. Piac argued employers would be forced to \u201cquantify a range of hypothetical circumstances that could have a financial impact on the business\u201d. \u201cIt is difficult, if not impossible, to see how this could be done,\u201d it said.",

Ever since their shock defeat in May, the ALP has been effectively silent. Whereas most incoming political leaders are now eager to display their authenticity with bold speeches on their core values and motivating ideals, Anthony Albanese has chosen a different path. He is waiting for the results of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/10/albanese-warns-labor-will-lose-next-election-without-change-in-direction\">Labor\u2019s internal review into the party\u2019s electoral failings</a> before he decides which fundamental identity to disclose.</p> \n<p>Some here find this stability reassuring. Few want to cope with the daily chaos of American impeachment, British Brexit or French gilets jaunes.</p> \n<p>But scratch beneath the surface and the challenges that animate those movements elsewhere are alive in Australia too. An intensifying divide between rich and poor, the threat of climate catastrophe, the erosion of stable stories of national identity, racial and ethnic hatreds \u2013 each of these issues shape the 21st century in every part of the world. They are our realities, whether we live in Athens or Adelaide, Seattle or Sydney.</p> \n<p>Australia cannot then continue with the politics of denial forever.

Social division and distrust in established political institutions \u2013 parliament, parties, politicians \u2013 as the potential agents of change, are deepening by the day. And each make the task of responding to the challenges of our times harder not easier.</p> \n<p>So what is to be done?</p> \n<p>We can be certain the politicians will not change course by themselves. That is expecting too much, even of the good ones. Democratic politicians almost always have to respond to agendas set by others. The short-termism engendered by three-year election cycles makes that all but inevitable.</p> \n<p>Nor will it come from those who have done well out of the economic order of the last four decades and have most to lose from policy change, like many of the multinational corporations.</p> \n<p>The job of confronting the future, therefore, must fall to the rest of us.</p> \n<p>It is for everyday citizens \u2013 from all backgrounds, all walks of life \u2013 to set the new agenda.</p> \n<p>Like many people, I used to think that was impossible. I thought there was no way the established powers in modern democracies would cede their agenda-setting role to anyone else.</p> \n<p>But not any more. Because the lessons of the last decade are that breathtaking political change is possible and that it is more often driven from outside the system than from within.</p> \n<p>Sometimes this is presented as a phenomenon only of the far right.

      "bodyText": "Australian politics has never felt as far out of step with the rest of the democratic world. While other major democracies openly confront existential crises, politicians in Australia carry on apparently without a care in the world. Nothing symbolised this gulf more clearly than Scott Morrison in New York last week. As international leaders gathered to debate the acute threat of climate change \u2013 and to be eloquently berated by Greta Thunberg \u2013 the prime minister decided to give the UN\u2019s climate summit a miss and went to inspect a newly automated McDonald\u2019s instead. But it is not just the sitting government that appears to be sitting out the crises engulfing the rest of the world. Ever since their shock defeat in May, the ALP has been effectively silent. Whereas most incoming political leaders are now eager to display their authenticity with bold speeches on their core values and motivating ideals, Anthony Albanese has chosen a different path. He is waiting for the results of Labor\u2019s internal review into the party\u2019s electoral failings before he decides which fundamental identity to disclose. Some here find this stability reassuring. Few want to cope with the daily chaos of American impeachment, British Brexit or French gilets jaunes. But scratch beneath the surface and the challenges that animate those movements elsewhere are alive in Australia too. An intensifying divide between rich and poor, the threat of climate catastrophe, the erosion of stable stories of national identity, racial and ethnic hatreds \u2013 each of these issues shape the 21st century in every part of the world. They are our realities, whether we live in Athens or Adelaide, Seattle or Sydney. Australia cannot then continue with the politics of denial forever. We will have to face our own momentous moments of political decision, just as the rest of the democratic world is doing right now. And the longer Australia puts that moment off, the more intense our difficulties will be. It does not take too much excavation to see that. Social division and distrust in established political institutions \u2013 parliament, parties, politicians \u2013 as the potential agents of change, are deepening by the day. And each make the task of responding to the challenges of our times harder not easier. So what is to be done? We can be certain the politicians will not change course by themselves. That is expecting too much, even of the good ones. Democratic politicians almost always have to respond to agendas set by others. The short-termism engendered by three-year election cycles makes that all but inevitable. Nor will it come from those who have done well out of the economic order of the last four decades and have most to lose from policy change, like many of the multinational corporations. The job of confronting the future, therefore, must fall to the rest of us. It is for everyday citizens \u2013 from all backgrounds, all walks of life \u2013 to set the new agenda. Like many people, I used to think that was impossible. I thought there was no way the established powers in modern democracies would cede their agenda-setting role to anyone else. But not any more. Because the lessons of the last decade are that breathtaking political change is possible and that it is more often driven from outside the system than from within. Sometimes this is presented as a phenomenon only of the far right. Nigel Farage\u2019s United Kingdom Independence party (Ukip) came from nowhere to revolutionise British politics, probably for generations. Donald Trump\u2019s toxic mix of celebrity television and white nationalism has done the same for the United States. But in fact, as research by my Sydney Policy Lab colleagues Amanda Tattersall and Kurt Iveson shows, progressive forces have been gathering internationally too, especially in cities. In Spain, new citizen-led movements have taken over the governance of Barcelona; in South Africa\u2019s Cape Town, everyday citizens have proposed radical new solutions for affordable housing; in London, charities and young migrant campaigners have worked hand in hand with the mayor, Sadiq Khan, to transform the debate on race and immigration; and, of course, in Hong Kong, citizens have challenged one of the mightiest political powers of all. All of us eager for change have much to learn by listening to those who lead them, examining their ideas and organising tactics. When we do, we see they are almost always broad coalitions. Their success depends not on the efforts of one small group but on collaborations between sections of society, many of whom have not worked together before.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m fascinated by spectacles because I\u2019m a consumer of the product. I\u2019ve worn them from a young age and they\u2019re an indelible part of who I am. I\u2019ve always liked them. My dad wore glasses too, and I remember for family photos he\u2019d take them off whereas I\u2019d put mine on. What amazes me is that although over two in three need spectacles, very few people know the story of them.</p> <p>The business of spectacles comes from the Enlightenment. Sir Isaac Newton was looking at refraction of light in the late 1600s. In 1704 he wrote a book called Opticks when he was living on Jermyn Street, London, and that paved the way for different industries including the invention of microscopes and telescopes, and the optical lens industry was another child of that moment. The industry blossomed, with key proponents including <a href=\"https://www.college-optometrists.org/the-college/museum/online-exhibitions/virtual-spectacles-gallery/eighteenth-century-spectacles.html\" title=\"\">Edward Scarlett</a>, who made the first frames in 1727, and <a href=\"http://journal.sciencemuseum.org.uk/browse/issue-02/james-short-and-john-harrison/the-refracting-telescope-and-john-dollond/\" title=\"\">John Dollond</a>, who was the son of a Huguenot silk weaver who moved to Spitalfields from France during the persecution. He joined the Spitalfields Mathematical Society, who used to meet in a pub, get pissed on mead and talk about numbers. He made the world\u2019s first achromatic lens and set up the first opticians \u2013 Dollond &amp; Aitchison \u2013 turning spectacles from a matter of pure science into a consumer proposition. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0afffe2a2fc996c2d4f7934758de9878aca77e44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0afffe2a2fc996c2d4f7934758de9878aca77e44/654_354_4043_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Copper spectacles with rosewood case, made in Nuremberg, early 1700s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"900\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Copper spectacles with rosewood case, made in Nuremberg, early 1700s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DEA/A Dagli Orti/De Agostini via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1750, when the first opticians were set up, life was pretty shit. Life expectancy was 38. Glasses were seen as academic, scholarly and scientific, and they were extremely expensive, though in the early 19th century they expanded from scientific to affluent communities \u2013 and the materials used changed accordingly. Glasses were originally made from steel but that extended to rolled gold, tortoiseshell and horn. In came the lorgnette, invented in 1785 by <a href=\"https://www.college-optometrists.org/the-college/museum/online-exhibitions/virtual-spectacles-gallery/lorgnettes-and-folding-eyeglasses.html\" title=\"\">George Adams</a>, for wealthy ladies to whip out at the theatre. </p> <p>The early 1900s were the golden age of optics. Glasses could be produced more cheaply and the cost came down but they were still the preserve of relative affluence. Your glasses would be the most expensive thing you owned and your most treasured possession. As a consequence, there was an industry of repair. Timpsons shoe repair used to mend spectacles alongside shoes.</p> <p>The seismic moment was in 1948 when the National Health Service was established. One of its key pillars was taking spectacles to the masses. They went from being the preserve of people who could go to Clerkenwell to spend a small fortune on spectacles to being given to anyone who needed them, for free, by the state.</p> <p>That scheme was unprecedented: nothing had been attempted like that before in the world. Sight is still a major problem \u2013 more than 2 billion people worldwide don\u2019t have access to glasses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc27db7f551bf0d8d703ae1ef4267a55a4081df6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc27db7f551bf0d8d703ae1ef4267a55a4081df6/197_472_3169_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Headband spectacles, English, 1796.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Headband spectacles, English, 1796.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science &amp; Society Picture Library/SSPL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also had a huge impact on the industry. At the start of the second world war there were 200-300 different workshops across Britain making bespoke and small-run stuff. The NHS offered seven shapes of frames, and 5m frames a year. The workshops that got the NHS contacts thrived and everything else shut or combined. By 1986, when the NHS stopped offering free glasses to all, there were three companies which had the NHS contracts knocking out these stock agreed frames. Two of these three went out of the business. The third \u2013 called <a href=\"http://field-grey.com/blog/savile-row-eyewear-a-tour-of-the-algha-works-factory-hackney-wick/\" title=\"\">The Algha Works</a> \u2013 managed to survive. They went back to traditional premium materials such as rolled gold. At their peak they employed 500 people; now they employ seven.</p> <p>This has all left us with a peculiar relationship with glasses. British standards in optics are still stringent. We have dispensing opticians; if you wander the streets of Paris you see beautiful little shops that sell glasses; whereas in Japan you put your head in a machine which uses autorefractors and prints your prescription off. But the NHS scheme meant that glasses became seen as a medical device and the frames weren\u2019t designed to look nice but to find the smallest number of frames that could fit the maximum number of heads. So spectacles became derided. When I was at school the stigma associated with them was huge. They were a sign you didn\u2019t have money or style. </p> <p>I grew up in Leicester and I was exposed to a new world when I came across the brand <a href=\"https://www.cutlerandgross.com/\" title=\"\">Cutler &amp; Gross</a>. When I started working and received my first pay cheque I got a pair of their frames sent up from London. It was a big deal and there was an unveiling at the opticians. </p> <p>The more you find out about the history of British optics, the more you realise how incredible it is. Spectacles touch on so many things \u2013 they enable your vision, they\u2019re about manufacturing, design, phrenology, optics, materiality. The story is intoxicating.</p> <p><em>Tom Broughton is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.cubitts.com/\">Cubitts spectacle makers</a> </em></p>",

The industry blossomed, with key proponents including Edward Scarlett, who made the first frames in 1727, and John Dollond, who was the son of a Huguenot silk weaver who moved to Spitalfields from France during the persecution. He joined the Spitalfields Mathematical Society, who used to meet in a pub, get pissed on mead and talk about numbers. He made the world\u2019s first achromatic lens and set up the first opticians \u2013 Dollond &amp; Aitchison \u2013 turning spectacles from a matter of pure science into a consumer proposition. In 1750, when the first opticians were set up, life was pretty shit. Life expectancy was 38. Glasses were seen as academic, scholarly and scientific, and they were extremely expensive, though in the early 19th century they expanded from scientific to affluent communities \u2013 and the materials used changed accordingly. Glasses were originally made from steel but that extended to rolled gold, tortoiseshell and horn. In came the lorgnette, invented in 1785 by George Adams, for wealthy ladies to whip out at the theatre. The early 1900s were the golden age of optics. Glasses could be produced more cheaply and the cost came down but they were still the preserve of relative affluence. Your glasses would be the most expensive thing you owned and your most treasured possession. As a consequence, there was an industry of repair. Timpsons shoe repair used to mend spectacles alongside shoes. The seismic moment was in 1948 when the National Health Service was established. One of its key pillars was taking spectacles to the masses. They went from being the preserve of people who could go to Clerkenwell to spend a small fortune on spectacles to being given to anyone who needed them, for free, by the state. That scheme was unprecedented: nothing had been attempted like that before in the world. Sight is still a major problem \u2013 more than 2 billion people worldwide don\u2019t have access to glasses. It also had a huge impact on the industry. At the start of the second world war there were 200-300 different workshops across Britain making bespoke and small-run stuff. The NHS offered seven shapes of frames, and 5m frames a year. The workshops that got the NHS contacts thrived and everything else shut or combined. By 1986, when the NHS stopped offering free glasses to all, there were three companies which had the NHS contracts knocking out these stock agreed frames. Two of these three went out of the business. The third \u2013 called The Algha Works \u2013 managed to survive. They went back to traditional premium materials such as rolled gold. At their peak they employed 500 people; now they employ seven. This has all left us with a peculiar relationship with glasses. British standards in optics are still stringent. We have dispensing opticians; if you wander the streets of Paris you see beautiful little shops that sell glasses; whereas in Japan you put your head in a machine which uses autorefractors and prints your prescription off. But the NHS scheme meant that glasses became seen as a medical device and the frames weren\u2019t designed to look nice but to find the smallest number of frames that could fit the maximum number of heads. So spectacles became derided. When I was at school the stigma associated with them was huge. They were a sign you didn\u2019t have money or style. I grew up in Leicester and I was exposed to a new world when I came across the brand Cutler &amp; Gross. When I started working and received my first pay cheque I got a pair of their frames sent up from London. It was a big deal and there was an unveiling at the opticians. The more you find out about the history of British optics, the more you realise how incredible it is. Spectacles touch on so many things \u2013 they enable your vision, they\u2019re about manufacturing, design, phrenology, optics, materiality. The story is intoxicating.

      "body": "<p><strong>Q</strong> My aunt (89 years young) is currently in a care home but is desperate to get back to her own home as she\u2019s not happy in a residential home environment.</p> <p>She cannot look after herself and her home will need much work to refurbish to allow her to live there (all the plumbing, kitchens and bathrooms need replacing). She cannot afford to do this but has a friend who is willing to buy below market value, move in with his young family and allow my aunt to live on the ground floor, rent free. He and his wife would provide the care for her.</p> <p>I am her attorney and it worries me that this could fall foul on many grounds. My primary concern is her long-term well being and I want her to be happy. She believes this is a good option for her. She also has her mental faculties so can make her own decisions.</p> <p>What should be the legal steps taken to protect her long term interests and ensure she can continue living there as long as she wants, rent free (assuming health permits)<br><strong>MB</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I think you are right to be concerned that such an arrangement could go horribly wrong. The only surefire way to ensure that your aunt can carry on living in her house rent-free for as long as she wants is for her to retain ownership of the property. So maybe the answer is to turn the arrangement on its head.

      "bodyText": "Q My aunt (89 years young) is currently in a care home but is desperate to get back to her own home as she\u2019s not happy in a residential home environment. She cannot look after herself and her home will need much work to refurbish to allow her to live there (all the plumbing, kitchens and bathrooms need replacing). She cannot afford to do this but has a friend who is willing to buy below market value, move in with his young family and allow my aunt to live on the ground floor, rent free. He and his wife would provide the care for her. I am her attorney and it worries me that this could fall foul on many grounds. My primary concern is her long-term well being and I want her to be happy. She believes this is a good option for her. She also has her mental faculties so can make her own decisions. What should be the legal steps taken to protect her long term interests and ensure she can continue living there as long as she wants, rent free (assuming health permits) MB A I think you are right to be concerned that such an arrangement could go horribly wrong. The only surefire way to ensure that your aunt can carry on living in her house rent-free for as long as she wants is for her to retain ownership of the property. So maybe the answer is to turn the arrangement on its head. Instead of selling her house to her friend for a bargain price and losing control of her destiny, she could invite her friend and his family to live rent-free in the part of the property she doesn\u2019t inhabit in exchange for their providing her care. If the plumbing, kitchen and bathrooms genuinely need replacing \u2013 which I somehow doubt unless they really are non-functioning and that was what made her move to the care home \u2013 she could finance any necessary work by releasing equity from her property.

When Fight for $15 began in late 2012, its original strategy was to exert so much pressure on McDonald\u2019s that the fast food giant would agree to sit down and discuss wages and other matters and perhaps promise not to resist unionization efforts. But McDonald\u2019s has refused to talk with the Fight for $15\u2019s leaders.</p> <p>With its latest effort, Local 32BJ, a powerful local union with 175,000 members, hopes to make clear to Chipotle and McDonald\u2019s that it is intent on unionizing their restaurants in New York, and they shouldn\u2019t oppose that effort. Union officials say a majority of the hundreds of fast-food workers organizers have approached have signed cards supporting a union.</p> <p>Jeremy Espinal, who works at a Chipotle in Greenwich Village, said he supports unionization because managers often treat workers with little respect. \u201cThe managers try to dehumanize you and try to beat you down mentally as much as they can so they can overwork you and make you feel you\u2019re never doing enough,\u201d said Espinal, a junior at Hunter College.</p> <p>Espinal said the work includes lots of lifting and is far harder than he had anticipated. \u201cI tore my achilles heel at Chipotle,\u201d he said. \u201cI cut off part of my thumb.

      "bodyText": "The Fight for $15 low wage movement has long had two goals: winning a $15 -an-hour wage for low-paid workers and a union for fast-food workers. On wages it has been a major success \u2013 seven states have enacted minimum wage laws scheduled to reach $15 \u2013 but so far it has made little progress unionizing fast-food workers. That could soon change. A Manhattan-based union local that works closely with the Fight for $15 has launched an effort to unionize Chipotle and McDonald\u2019s workers, getting workers at more than 50 restaurants to sign pro-union cards. \u201cWe\u2019re running a campaign for workers in an industry that has been abusing its workers,\u201d said Kyle Bragg, president of the local carrying out the unionization drive, Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union. \u201cThese workers want a union. We\u2019re organizing in order to lift workers and improve their lives.\u201d Until now, the Fight for $15 \u2013 which was underwritten by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) \u2013 hadn\u2019t begun a formal unionization effort at fast-food restaurants. When Fight for $15 began in late 2012, its original strategy was to exert so much pressure on McDonald\u2019s that the fast food giant would agree to sit down and discuss wages and other matters and perhaps promise not to resist unionization efforts. But McDonald\u2019s has refused to talk with the Fight for $15\u2019s leaders. With its latest effort, Local 32BJ, a powerful local union with 175,000 members, hopes to make clear to Chipotle and McDonald\u2019s that it is intent on unionizing their restaurants in New York, and they shouldn\u2019t oppose that effort. Union officials say a majority of the hundreds of fast-food workers organizers have approached have signed cards supporting a union. Jeremy Espinal, who works at a Chipotle in Greenwich Village, said he supports unionization because managers often treat workers with little respect. \u201cThe managers try to dehumanize you and try to beat you down mentally as much as they can so they can overwork you and make you feel you\u2019re never doing enough,\u201d said Espinal, a junior at Hunter College. Espinal said the work includes lots of lifting and is far harder than he had anticipated. \u201cI tore my achilles heel at Chipotle,\u201d he said. \u201cI cut off part of my thumb. I have burn marks on my arm.\u201d He also complained that after managers learned he was an outspoken union supporter, his hours were cut from 25 a week to 11. Princess Wright backs unionization at her McDonald\u2019s in downtown Brooklyn. She said the managers \u201cmake it seem like they\u2019re for you, but there\u2019s a lot of wage theft and playing around with our hours. If we start at 11, they\u2019ll say we started at 11.15. Sometimes you work 48 hours a week, and they pay you for only 40.\u201d She complained that managers want employees to be available to work any time of the week, and that they sometimes scheduled her to work certain hours even though she had told managers that those hours conflicted with her college classes. Workers at various Chipotles and McDonald\u2019s said managers sometimes failed to comply with New York City\u2019s new Fair Workweek Law, which requires giving fast-food workers two weeks\u2019 advance notice of their work schedule and paying them premiums when their hours are changed with little notice or they are called in at the last minute. Helped by Local 32BJ, more than 30 current or former Chipotle workers filed complaints with the city about not receiving premium pay for schedule changes, prompting the city\u2019s office of consumer and workplace protections to file a lawsuit against Chipotle, seeking more than $1m in restitution for violating its Fair Workweek Law. With Chipotle having adopted the motto \u201cfood with integrity\u201d, Bragg said, \u201cChipotle has branded itself to be this different fast-food chain that strives for excellence with their workers, but you can\u2019t achieve that if you treat your workers like trash. We want to help that company achieve what they want to be.\u201d Laurie Schalow, Chipotle\u2019s chief reputation officer, said: \u201cChipotle has been working cooperatively with the city to ensure we have systems and processes in place to comply with\u201d the Fair Workweek Law.

The McDonald\u2019s Corporation said: \u201cTogether with our independent franchisees, we pride ourselves on building a workplace that supports crew members and their ambitions.\u201d McDonald\u2019s added that it \u201crecognizes the rights under the law of individual employees to choose to join \u2013 or choose not to join \u2013 labor organizations\u201d. McDonald\u2019s said it has begun an ambitious program to train more than 2,000 franchisees and 850,000 employees to make sure workers are treated with dignity and to combat bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment. Jahaira Garcia, a union supporter who works at a Chipotle on Second Avenue in Manhattan, said sexual harassment was a problem at her restaurant. \u201cThe men are too touchy,\u201d she said.

Since then, the Stones have barely made a coherent album, though the <em>Companion</em> is excited by the disco influences on 1978\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/13/rolling-stones-some-girls-interview\" title=\"\"><em>Some Girls</em></a>. There is, naturally, oodles about the blues, a subject already well represented in faculty libraries, though scant mention of the Stones\u2019 epiphanic encounter with Muddy Waters at Chicago\u2019s Chess Studios in 1964. Of the strong reggae flavours on 1970s albums like <em>Black and Blue</em> there is also no word.</p> <p>Given that today\u2019s culture wars are waged with particular vigour on North American campuses (sex, gender and identity indeed), one might also have expected a discourse on the place of women in Stones songs, the offending (to some) litany running from Stupid Girl and Under My Thumb to Brown Sugar and Some Girls, but the sole female voice among the nine here is otherwise engaged. The question why anyone would want to write a song celebrating a serial killer of women (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRot9IjNSso\" title=\"\">Midnight Rambler</a>) doesn\u2019t arise; maybe it\u2019s just what Richards calls \u201ca blues opera\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to understand the crossfire hurricane that propelled the Stones during their 1968-72 pomp without considering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/16/performance-i-still-dont-fully-understand-it-behind-the-scenes-photos-from-the-cult-classic\" title=\"\"><em>Performance</em></a> (1970), a glaring omission here. True, the film and its soundtrack are not a Stones venture, yet writer Donald Cammell\u2019s tale of faded pop star (Jagger) and East End gangster (James Fox) remains, in the words of Marianne Faithfull, a perceptive real-life Stones companion, \u201can allegory of libertine Chelsea with its baronial rock stars, wayward <em>jeunesse dor\u00e9e</em>, drugs, sex and decadence\u2026 a whole era under glass\u201d.</p> <p>Shot through with esoteric ideas, <em>Performance</em> built on Jagger\u2019s infatuation with his dark side, apparent since Sympathy for the Devil (or \u201csome little twerp dancing round thinking he\u2019s Satan\u201d, according to Ry Cooder, a player on <em>Let It Bleed</em> and <em>Performance</em>). Jagger\u2019s character, Turner, is an amalgam of Jones and Richards, a matrix compounded by leading lady Anita Pallenberg, Richards\u2019s then partner (and Jones\u2019s ex). Keith and Anita\u2019s descent into junkiedom was among what Faithfull terms the film\u2019s \u201cdeadly aftereffects\u201d. Surely worth a doctoral thesis, then?</p> <p>The Stones\u2019 attitude to academia was mocking rather than hostile. Mick, Keith and Brian were all ex-grammar school boys, respectively LSE undergrad, art-school dropout and trained musician. An early interviewer was perplexed by how such fine educations could result in their moronic reputation. \u201cThere are a lot of morons in grammar schools,\u201d shot back Mick.</p> <p><em>This review is from the Observer</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 The Cambridge Companion to the Rolling Stones, </em>edited by Victor Coelho and John Covach, is published by Cambridge University Press (\u00a315.99).

Songs such as Mother\u2019s Little Helper and Play With Fire are more than reflections of \u201cmod London\u201d, they are vignettes of a society in transition, when depressed mums took up pill habits and St John\u2019s Wood heiresses rubbed shoulders with pop stars and celebrity gangsters. Most of the book\u2019s firepower is directed at the central album quartet of Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main Street (1972), all given sound but pedestrian readings, with much cooing over Mick Taylor\u2019s guitar solos. Since then, the Stones have barely made a coherent album, though the Companion is excited by the disco influences on 1978\u2019s Some Girls. There is, naturally, oodles about the blues, a subject already well represented in faculty libraries, though scant mention of the Stones\u2019 epiphanic encounter with Muddy Waters at Chicago\u2019s Chess Studios in 1964. Of the strong reggae flavours on 1970s albums like Black and Blue there is also no word. Given that today\u2019s culture wars are waged with particular vigour on North American campuses (sex, gender and identity indeed), one might also have expected a discourse on the place of women in Stones songs, the offending (to some) litany running from Stupid Girl and Under My Thumb to Brown Sugar and Some Girls, but the sole female voice among the nine here is otherwise engaged. The question why anyone would want to write a song celebrating a serial killer of women (Midnight Rambler) doesn\u2019t arise; maybe it\u2019s just what Richards calls \u201ca blues opera\u201d. It\u2019s difficult to understand the crossfire hurricane that propelled the Stones during their 1968-72 pomp without considering Performance (1970), a glaring omission here. True, the film and its soundtrack are not a Stones venture, yet writer Donald Cammell\u2019s tale of faded pop star (Jagger) and East End gangster (James Fox) remains, in the words of Marianne Faithfull, a perceptive real-life Stones companion, \u201can allegory of libertine Chelsea with its baronial rock stars, wayward jeunesse dor\u00e9e, drugs, sex and decadence\u2026 a whole era under glass\u201d. Shot through with esoteric ideas, Performance built on Jagger\u2019s infatuation with his dark side, apparent since Sympathy for the Devil (or \u201csome little twerp dancing round thinking he\u2019s Satan\u201d, according to Ry Cooder, a player on Let It Bleed and Performance). Jagger\u2019s character, Turner, is an amalgam of Jones and Richards, a matrix compounded by leading lady Anita Pallenberg, Richards\u2019s then partner (and Jones\u2019s ex). Keith and Anita\u2019s descent into junkiedom was among what Faithfull terms the film\u2019s \u201cdeadly aftereffects\u201d. Surely worth a doctoral thesis, then? The Stones\u2019 attitude to academia was mocking rather than hostile. Mick, Keith and Brian were all ex-grammar school boys, respectively LSE undergrad, art-school dropout and trained musician. An early interviewer was perplexed by how such fine educations could result in their moronic reputation. \u201cThere are a lot of morons in grammar schools,\u201d shot back Mick.

The number of military police investigations \u2013 which the Ministry of Defence has admitted is low \u2013 was revealed following a Freedom of Information Act by the Guardian and cover those conducted in the army, navy and air force since 2015.

Nkululeko Zulu and Hani Gue had taken the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to a tribunal claiming it had failed to take reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and harassment against them. The issue comes at a particularly sensitive time for the armed forces, which faces an army recruitment crisis, and has been running high profile campaigns aimed at recruiting more people from a diversity of genders, sexualities, ethnicities and faiths. But questions also remain about what happened after the investigations carried out in recent years by the armed forces police which, unlike civilian police forces, do not charge suspects.

India\u2019s prime minister will make the announcement on Wednesday at an event in his home state of Gujarat, attended by 20,000 village chiefs and international dignitaries, according to the government. But Modi\u2019s claims about the success of his Swachh Bharat (Clean India) programme mask a bleaker reality, with reports of intimidation, harassment and violence. Last week, two low-caste children caught defecating outside were lynched. The programme was launched in 2014 and sparked a flurry of toilet-building \u2013 more than 100m in five years. Politicians and Bollywood stars have participated in huge government publicity campaigns to promote the scheme, and children in rural schools have marched around villages singing about the public health benefits of eliminating open defecation. Numerous government and independent studies show that open defecation has dramatically declined. But the programme has been dogged by criticism of overzealous government workers, volunteers and vigilantes using coercive tactics to help the government\u2019s effort. An Indian news channel reported that the children killed last week in Madhya Pradesh \u2013 a 12-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy \u2013 lived in a small hut without a toilet, in a village that was declared open-defecation free in April last year. The mother of one of the children told India Today: \u201cThey were defecating in the open and that\u2019s why they were killed.\u201d The toilet-building has led to huge advances in sanitation. An independent study of four states by the Institute of Labour Economics found that, between the programme\u2019s launch and the end of 2018, the number of people who admitted to defecating in the open declined from 70% to approximately 40-50%, reducing open defecation on average 4% faster than before the programme was launched. A researcher who worked on the study said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that toilet usage had increased dramatically since the report was released, since local government officials had spent much of the past few months organising India\u2019s elections, which took place in May. The report was disputed by India\u2019s government, who said in January that rural toilet usage was 93.4%. Academics and opposition parties have accused the government of \u201cfudging data\u201d to meet the government\u2019s ambitious targets. More than half of interviewees for the independent study said the programme had led to abuse. A report listed a number of alarming incidents. One video showed a woman screaming as she was dragged into a car by village \u201cmotivators\u201d. Another showed men holding their ears and doing sit-ups surrounded by police officers and government staff as a punishment for open defecation. The study also listed local news reports documenting attacks against open defecators, and showed hoardings in one district that warned: \u201cIf you defecate in the open, you will soon get death.\u201d Sangita Vyas, a research fellow at the Rice Institute, said: \u201cFor Swachh Bharat to have made huge progress, they would have needed to address caste hierarchies and beliefs in purity and pollution. We found that it seems to have exacerbated caste hierarchies. Sanitation is used as a method for elite groups to suppress marginalised communities.\u201d Concerns were also raised in a report last year by the UN special rapporteur for safe drinking water and sanitation, Leo Heller. \u201cAs an unintended consequence of the desire to obtain rewards, including the title of \u2018open-defecation free\u2019, some aggressive and abusive practices seem to have emerged,\u201d he wrote. Heller reported that \u201cindividuals defecating in the open are being shamed, harassed, attacked or otherwise penalised,\u201d and that accused open defecators faced being denied food rations, or having their electricity disconnected. Heller also noted the Indian government \u201crecognised the existence of abuse associated with the Clean India mission implementation and issued at least two advisories to all states underlining that such practices must stop\u201d. Despite rapid economic strides in past decades, India has lagged behind other countries on sanitation. Academics have argued that the practice of open defecation has survived because cleaning toilets is considered low-caste work. The killings of the two children in Madhya Pradesh occurred hours after Modi received an award in New York from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the Clean India programme. News of the award was met with protests and has reinvigorated debates about the role western governments and philanthropic organisations have played in boosting Modi\u2019s profile. It led one Gates Foundation employee, Sabah Hamid, who worked in the organisation\u2019s India office, to resign in protest. Speaking to the Guardian about her decision, Hamid said she was \u201cincredulous\u201d when she learned about the award. \u201cIt seemed contrary to everything the foundation works on and claims to believe in,\u201d she said. During the award ceremony, a map of India projected on to a screen turned green, showing that the country was due to become open defecation free by 2 October. A video that played on stage flashed up a quote from India\u2019s founding father, Mohandas Gandhi, saying: \u201cSanitation is more important than political independence.\u201d The Gates Foundation did not respond to requests for comment, but has previously said: \u201cBefore the Swachh Bharat mission, over 500 million people in India did not have access to safe sanitation, and now, the majority do. There is still a long way to go, but the impacts of access to sanitation in India are already being realised.\u201d An email sent to India\u2019s foreign and home ministries went unanswered.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>New literature museum</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>Museum of Literature Ireland</strong>,<strong> </strong>or<strong> </strong>MoLI (for some the acronym will conjure up images of Molly Bloom in James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses) has been a long time coming. The National Library of Ireland and University College Dublin began talking about a collaboration in 2010, with the aim of making proper use of two important assets: the NLI\u2019s extensive James Joyce collection, and the university\u2019s historic home, a fine Georgian townhouse on St Stephen\u2019s Green. It was always going to be a big tourist draw, but museums dedicated to books or writers rarely capture the magic of reading. MoLI, which opened last week, is different. Unsurprisingly Joyce, who attended university in this building, features heavily, with a vast array of rare editions and manuscripts that are sure to delight fans of Ireland\u2019s great modernist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b9232dd0fe5e5439b0484ba863386f7bfa474a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b9232dd0fe5e5439b0484ba863386f7bfa474a1/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the James Joyce section of the Museum of Literature Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the James Joyce section of the Museum of Literature Ireland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is anything but a mausoleum for old books though, and an assortment of clever interactive exhibits coupled with a strong focus on living writers give MoLI a real vitality. There are scale models and films that explore Joycean Dublin, and striking arrangements of terrifyingly messy notebooks and manuscripts that give insight into the processes behind works like Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. But there are also recordings of some of Ireland\u2019s current leading writers discussing their lives and their writing, and space for visual art commissions and temporary exhibitions. There are also landscaped gardens at the back of the museum that connect to the Iveagh Gardens, a somewhat hidden green space surrounded by buildings, that are beloved by Dubliners whenever the sun is out. <br>\u2022 <em>Adult \u20ac8, child \u20ac6, guided tour \u20ac12</em><em>, open daily 10am-6pm</em>, <em><a href=\"https://moli.ie/\" title=\"\">moli.ie</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Guinness and more</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"caba505e1e0c20333efd822c7878b3fcdb670b41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caba505e1e0c20333efd822c7878b3fcdb670b41/0_131_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nearys, Chatham Street exterior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>You shouldn\u2019t need any help finding a decent pub in Dublin, but for beer fans looking for something a little different, Guinness\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.guinnessopengate.com/visit-the-taproom\" title=\"\">Open Gate</a></strong> brewpub taproom (entry \u20ac9 including samples, open Thur-Sat, booking advised) on St James Street is worth checking out. Visitors are treated to a flight of samples from a rotating selection of experimental beers, such as Hopportunity Ale and Black IPA, and get a chance to chat to the experts. There are also beers on tap and a bar food menu. Traditionalists may prefer <strong>Neary\u2019s</strong> pub on Chatham Street, which is on the opposite side of St Stephen\u2019s Green to MoLI. It\u2019s a fine example of a Victorian boozer and was a favourite of two of Dublin\u2019s heavy-drinking, 20th-century literary heavyweights \u2013 Brendan Behan and Patrick Kavanagh. <br></p> <h2><strong>Heaney exhibition</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e7ba1c7e4271d187b3d8855310a8367e7db7884\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e7ba1c7e4271d187b3d8855310a8367e7db7884/469_0_8319_4992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seamus Heaney: Listen Now Again exhibition\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A couple of years before his death in 2013, Nobel laureate poet and playwright Seamus Heaney showed up at the National Library of Ireland with a carload of personal documents. He wanted them to stay in Ireland and be available to the public, but it\u2019s unlikely that he thought they would become one of Dublin\u2019s most popular interactive exhibitions. It\u2019s the kind of thing that must be a curator\u2019s dream, and simultaneously a total nightmare \u2013 with worries about how to reduce it to a manageable size for public consumption while still conveying the full sense of an artist\u2019s life. It would have been easy to put huge chunks of it on display and, in the process, bore all but the most ardent fan to tears. Instead, it has been cleverly whittled down to about 100 pieces and woven together with audio and visual recordings, interactive displays and personal artefacts to give a view of the poet and his process from a human level, complete with amendments scribbled over first drafts, and revisions jotted alongside newspaper clippings of published poems. The Listen Now Again exhibition, at the new Bank of Ireland Cultural and Heritage Centre on College Green, will run for three years and does a great job of tracing Heaney\u2019s life from humble beginnings on a County Derry farm to global acclaim. <br>\u2022 <em>Free, open Mon-Sat, 10am- 4pm, at the Bank of Ireland Cultural and Heritage Centre</em><em>, <a href=\"https://www.nli.ie/en/udlist/current-exhibitions.aspx?article=0ebd1d65-6087-4f38-a2a0-467de598b745\" title=\"\">nli.ie</a></em></p> <h2>Seafood and noodles <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"322d1ac9a71d46a39920fd77e566f86914ec417a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/322d1ac9a71d46a39920fd77e566f86914ec417a/0_384_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish and seafood at The Winding Stair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The best of Irish cuisine can be found at <strong><a href=\"https://winding-stair.com/\" title=\"\">The Winding Stair</a></strong> (two-course lunch with wine \u20ac29.95) in Lower Ormond Quay, which<strong> </strong>started out as a cafe and bookshop in the 1970s before being transformed in 2006 into a more serious restaurant. The focus is firmly on seasonal Irish food, but much of the cafe\u2019s old charm has been preserved, including the bookshop downstairs. Potted crab, the superb smoked fish plate, cockles and mussels are personal favourites. Window seats come with a view over the River Liffey and the Ha\u2019penny bridge.

      "bodyText": "New literature museum The Museum of Literature Ireland, or MoLI (for some the acronym will conjure up images of Molly Bloom in James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses) has been a long time coming. The National Library of Ireland and University College Dublin began talking about a collaboration in 2010, with the aim of making proper use of two important assets: the NLI\u2019s extensive James Joyce collection, and the university\u2019s historic home, a fine Georgian townhouse on St Stephen\u2019s Green. It was always going to be a big tourist draw, but museums dedicated to books or writers rarely capture the magic of reading. MoLI, which opened last week, is different. Unsurprisingly Joyce, who attended university in this building, features heavily, with a vast array of rare editions and manuscripts that are sure to delight fans of Ireland\u2019s great modernist. It is anything but a mausoleum for old books though, and an assortment of clever interactive exhibits coupled with a strong focus on living writers give MoLI a real vitality. There are scale models and films that explore Joycean Dublin, and striking arrangements of terrifyingly messy notebooks and manuscripts that give insight into the processes behind works like Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. But there are also recordings of some of Ireland\u2019s current leading writers discussing their lives and their writing, and space for visual art commissions and temporary exhibitions. There are also landscaped gardens at the back of the museum that connect to the Iveagh Gardens, a somewhat hidden green space surrounded by buildings, that are beloved by Dubliners whenever the sun is out. \u2022 Adult \u20ac8, child \u20ac6, guided tour \u20ac12, open daily 10am-6pm, moli.ie Guinness and more You shouldn\u2019t need any help finding a decent pub in Dublin, but for beer fans looking for something a little different, Guinness\u2019s Open Gate brewpub taproom (entry \u20ac9 including samples, open Thur-Sat, booking advised) on St James Street is worth checking out. Visitors are treated to a flight of samples from a rotating selection of experimental beers, such as Hopportunity Ale and Black IPA, and get a chance to chat to the experts. There are also beers on tap and a bar food menu. Traditionalists may prefer Neary\u2019s pub on Chatham Street, which is on the opposite side of St Stephen\u2019s Green to MoLI. It\u2019s a fine example of a Victorian boozer and was a favourite of two of Dublin\u2019s heavy-drinking, 20th-century literary heavyweights \u2013 Brendan Behan and Patrick Kavanagh. Heaney exhibition A couple of years before his death in 2013, Nobel laureate poet and playwright Seamus Heaney showed up at the National Library of Ireland with a carload of personal documents. He wanted them to stay in Ireland and be available to the public, but it\u2019s unlikely that he thought they would become one of Dublin\u2019s most popular interactive exhibitions. It\u2019s the kind of thing that must be a curator\u2019s dream, and simultaneously a total nightmare \u2013 with worries about how to reduce it to a manageable size for public consumption while still conveying the full sense of an artist\u2019s life. It would have been easy to put huge chunks of it on display and, in the process, bore all but the most ardent fan to tears. Instead, it has been cleverly whittled down to about 100 pieces and woven together with audio and visual recordings, interactive displays and personal artefacts to give a view of the poet and his process from a human level, complete with amendments scribbled over first drafts, and revisions jotted alongside newspaper clippings of published poems. The Listen Now Again exhibition, at the new Bank of Ireland Cultural and Heritage Centre on College Green, will run for three years and does a great job of tracing Heaney\u2019s life from humble beginnings on a County Derry farm to global acclaim. \u2022 Free, open Mon-Sat, 10am- 4pm, at the Bank of Ireland Cultural and Heritage Centre, nli.ie Seafood and noodles The best of Irish cuisine can be found at The Winding Stair (two-course lunch with wine \u20ac29.95) in Lower Ormond Quay, which started out as a cafe and bookshop in the 1970s before being transformed in 2006 into a more serious restaurant. The focus is firmly on seasonal Irish food, but much of the cafe\u2019s old charm has been preserved, including the bookshop downstairs. Potted crab, the superb smoked fish plate, cockles and mussels are personal favourites. Window seats come with a view over the River Liffey and the Ha\u2019penny bridge. For something cheaper that represents the city\u2019s cosmopolitan nature, check out the Vietmanese dishes at Bun Cha (wonton noodle soup \u20ac9.50) on Moore Street. It\u2019s surrounded by street sellers and mobile phone repair shops, and the menu has pictures, but don\u2019t be put off. Those noodles are seriously good. Pedal to the peninsula The Howth peninsula juts out into the Irish Sea, enclosing the northern part of Dublin Bay. On a sunny day, the fishing village of Howth is well worth a visit and will feel a world away from the city, with lighthouses, a castle and hiking trails around the coast and up the headland\u2019s wild hillside. It is easily reached from downtown by bus or by Dart train (25-minute journey); or, if you\u2019re feeling energetic, a city bike will take you there in around 40 minutes on a dedicated bike path that runs out along the edge of the bay and past the North Bull Island nature reserve. There is no shortage of seafood restaurants to choose from: Octopussy\u2019s Seafood Tapas \u2013 serving Dublin Bay prawns (\u20ac16) and Calingford oysters (\u20ac2.50 each) \u2013 and the Brass Monkey (mini fish and chips with a bowl of chowder \u20ac13.50) are two favourites. Both are on the village\u2019s West Pier. Ancient world history The Chester Beatty Library is too often ignored, despite being voted the best museum in Europe in 2002. The collection was donated in 1950 by a US tycoon with impeccable taste in Asian and African art and manuscripts, and is now housed in Dublin Castle, overlooking Dubh Linn Garden. Currently there are two excellent temporary exhibits: Thai Buddhist Tales (pictured, until 26 Jan 2020) shows off the library\u2019s important collection of Buddhist manuscripts; and the Mystery of Mani (until 19 Jan), which examines the 1929 discovery in Egypt of seven papyrus books from the lost Manichaean religion, dating from around 400AD. \u2022 Entry free, suggested donation \u20ac5, open seven days a week, chesterbeatty.ie Independent bookshops Chapters is the largest independent bookshop in Ireland and close to the heart of most Dublin book lovers. A stone\u2019s throw from O\u2019Connell Street, it boasts an immense selection of new and used books. It\u2019s a great place to pick up a bargain and the staff are chatty and knowledgeable. On the other side of the Liffey, Books Upstairs is another staple. It is smaller than Chapters, but easier to navigate, and the selection is still impressive. It is also home to the Dublin Review of Books, one of the country\u2019s leading literary journals, and a charming cafe that regularly hosts book launches, readings, and discussions. Historic library Marsh\u2019s Library is tucked away behind St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in the city centre, and is often overlooked by both visitors and locals. It shouldn\u2019t be.

I was blown away by how much this man saw \u2013 things that have taken me 30 years of reflection to be willing to talk about. One of the most infuriating distinctions made in today\u2019s refugee debate is between refugees and economic migrants, who are often young men depicted as opportunists. In his novel Nowhere Man, Aleksandar Hemon dares to give the unpalatable immigrant boy a place. Here is Jozef, who arrived in Chicago before the siege of Sarajevo and must now watch his home turn to ruins, without even the designation of refugee as shelter. \u201cI am complicated,\u201d he says, as he struggles with a new identity thrust upon him by fate. The displacement narrative must naturally end with the gaze falling back on to home, and with the futility of return, the condition of permanent psychic exile. Anton Gill\u2019s The Journey Back from Hell is a powerful collection of oral testimonies from survivors of the Holocaust, a symphony of old trauma and grief, and a complex depiction of the impossibility of going back. Literature is a means of calling out to others to share our truest stories. Lately, I have my eyes on No Friend But the Mountains, Behrouz Boochani\u2019s memoir of his flight and incarceration on Manus Island, which he wrote on a phone and smuggled out of the prison. Boochani is still confined, his past out of reach, his future unknowable. I send him solidarity from this side of our intersecting saga. And a warning from Rilke: \u201cBeware o wanderer, the road is walking too.\u201d \u2022 The Ungrateful Refugee by Dina Nayeri is published by Canongate (\u00a316.99).

The prime minister is said to be furious at the claims by journalist Charlotte Edwardes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/no-10-denies-claims-boris-johnson-squeezed-thigh-journalist-charlotte-edwardes\">that at a private lunch in 1999</a>, Johnson touched her leg under a table, grabbing \u201cenough inner flesh beneath his fingers\u201d to make her \u201csit upright\u201d. Downing Street insiders privately described the claims as \u201cbollocks\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d. Edwardes tweeted on Sunday night: \u201cIf the prime minister doesn\u2019t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\u201d Johnson also remains under pressure over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/boris-johnson-no-interest-to-declare-in-arcuri-firm\">relationship with American tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri</a>, whose company received a public grant. Conference delegates, meanwhile, can expect plenty of references <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/ex-minister-rejects-allegations-rebels-colluded-with-eu-to-stop-no-deal\">to the \u201csurrender act\u201d</a> after the PM refused to moderate his language and repeated the phrase a dozen times on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr programme yesterday.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Whistleblower safety</strong> \u2013 Lawyers acting for the whistleblower at the centre of the impeachment scandal say President Trump\u2019s remarks are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/30/donald-trump-has-put-whistleblower-in-danger-lawyers-say-ukraine-impeachment\">putting their client in danger</a>. Andrew Bakaj said Trump\u2019s demands to know the identity of the whistleblower have led to safety concerns, and a $50,000 reward for information that would identify him or her. Bakaj has called on senior Democratic and Republican leaders to \u201cspeak out in favour of whistleblower protection\u201d. On Sunday night, Trump tweeted: \u201cI deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u2018Whistleblower\u2019, represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way\u201d. He also quoted a Fox News guest who said \u201cremoving the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal\u201d. It followed a weekend of Trump defenders,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/29/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-ukraine-impeachment-inquiry\"> led by his lawyer Rudy Guiliani</a>, attacking the unnamed whistleblower in an attempt to push back against the rapidly intensifying impeachment inquiry.

Williamson, who will announce the policy at the party conference, will say courses could become more popular than universities and that the new institutes of technology are intended to end the sector\u2019s image as a poor relation. They come on top of an additional \u00a3400m in funding for further education and sixth-form colleges announced at the end of last month.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Far-right vote collapses</strong> \u2013 Austria\u2019s Freedom party has lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/29/austrian-elections-exit-polls-collapse-far-right-support-sebastian-kurz-victory\">more than a third of its support</a>, in elections in which it was punished over a corruption scandal that brought down the government. The former chancellor Sebastian Kurz, 33, looks certain to reclaim his position as the youngest leader in the world after his conservative People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) secured 37.1% of the vote \u2013 its best result since 2002. The Freedom party\u2019s vote fell to 16%, while the Green party jumped to its best result at national elections with 14%. Kurz signalled on Sunday night that he was willing to enter coalition talks with both the Freedom party and the Green party.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Heart attacks</strong> \u2013 Women are dying from heart attacks unnecessarily because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/30/women-are-dying-needlessly-from-heart-attacks-says-charity\">mistaken perception that they mostly happen to men</a>.

The papers Boris Johnson remains front and centre on many of today\u2019s papers, with the Telegraph reporting a \u201cPlot to force Johnson into Brexit extension\u201d, in a story that claims opposition leaders will meet to see how they can force him into requesting an extension of Article 50. The Mirror says the PM\u2019s connection with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri is an \u201cabuse of power\u201d. The FT has \u201cDUP balks at Johnson plans\u201d. The Mail also carries a picture of Johnson with the headline: \u201cBoris\u2019s blonde \u2018told her friends they DID have an affair\u201d (but saves the most space for \u201cWomen driven to the brink by care crisis\u201d). The Guardian has \u201cPrime minister forced into denial of claims he groped two women\u201d, but it saves its splash for the devastating civil war in Yemen. The Express gives Johnson some support before his party\u2019s conference: \u201cBoris rally cry: get Brexit done to fix divided Britain\u201d but leads on \u201cBumper rise for pensions\u201d. The Times ignores Johnson and and Brexit altogether and opts for \u201cChildren face ban from school if not vaccinated\u201d. The i also splashes on that story with \u201cCompulsory vaccinated targeted for UK children\u201d. And the Sun has splashed on an \u201cexclusive\u201d about the \u201cPurrminator\u201d, a \u201cmonster puss(cat)\u201d on the loose in Hampstead.

Crowd brings brightness, abandon, tenderness, humour and sensuality, along with hints of darkness and violence, and is based on Vienne\u2019s own experiences of clubbing in Berlin in the early 90s.</p> <p>As a teenager, she went to squat parties in often spectacular abandoned houses and buildings in east Berlin (where she was living) or to <a href=\"https://tresorberlin.com/\">Tresor</a>, the legendary club in the underground vault of a bombed-out department store. \u201cThey were really extraordinary places, and the people going there were very inspiring,\u201d she says. \u201cThe whole scene was mesmerising, all this Detroit music culture that came in had a big impact on me.\u201d</p> <p>She was brought back to memories of those days when researching the iconic ballet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/12/rite-of-spring-stravinsky\">The Rite of Spring</a>, thinking about techno culture as a modern equivalent. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like pagan celebrations,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about ecstasy and losing control.\u201d</p> <p>Vienne brings up British philosopher Jules Evans\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/18/the-art-of-losing-control-by-jules-evans-review\">The Art of Losing Control</a>, in which he talks of the necessity of ecstatic experience. \u201cI would say liberal capitalist western societies don\u2019t have so much space any more for ecstatic experience, which other societies in the world do, and always have,\u201d she says. Violence, of the type that sometimes appears in Vienne\u2019s work, \u201ccan also be part of this ecstatic experience\u201d, she says. \u201cDarkness and violence are not necessarily negative. It can be very invigorating, joyful and pleasurable expressing primal energies in a context that is respectful of each other and doesn\u2019t disturb the balance of the community.\u201d Like a boxing match, or a pumped-up dance floor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f274dd34f5c86ab5cfcc114be88a3385ddc97af6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f274dd34f5c86ab5cfcc114be88a3385ddc97af6/0_0_3978_2878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Invigorating darkness ...

But more than just an expression of primal energies, the performance plays with the perception of time. It seems to compress and distort \u2013 something clubbers might recognise from their own nights out \u2013 thanks to cinematic choreographic effects: freeze frames, looping repeats and brilliantly realised slow motion.</p> <p>\u201cIf you see Crowd live, audiences have said they feel a little bit different afterwards than before they came into the theatre, a slightly altered way of being,\u201d says Vienne. \u201cI think there is this double feeling of being very sharp \u2013 because it has slowed down you can see detail in a sharper way than usual \u2013 and then a little bit of this stoned feeling.\u201d</p> <p>In history, much ecstatic experience was linked to religion; Vienne points out that art, too, was mostly bound to religion. Its position in modern secular society is often confused with entertainment, she thinks. \u201cI think both are totally necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cEntertainment is crucial and art is crucial, but I just think the contract with the audience is different, you are looking for a different experience.\u201d</p> <p>So what does she want to provide with her own art? \u201cI think it\u2019s more on the level of spiritual experience,\u201d says Vienne. \u201cIt\u2019s questioning, it\u2019s self-reflecting, it\u2019s human-reflecting. It\u2019s an experience of philosophy in a physical way,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, I would put it that way: it\u2019s physical philosophy.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Crowd is at <a href=\"https://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/2019/gisele-vienne-crowd/\">Sadler\u2019s Wells, London</a>, 8-9 October, as part of <a href=\"http://www.danceumbrella.co.uk/\">Dance Umbrella</a>, and at <a href=\"https://www.tramway.org/Pages/home.aspx\">Tramway, Glasgow</a>, on 16 October.</p></li> </ul>",

Violence, of the type that sometimes appears in Vienne\u2019s work, \u201ccan also be part of this ecstatic experience\u201d, she says. \u201cDarkness and violence are not necessarily negative. It can be very invigorating, joyful and pleasurable expressing primal energies in a context that is respectful of each other and doesn\u2019t disturb the balance of the community.\u201d Like a boxing match, or a pumped-up dance floor. In Crowd, we watch the increasing messiness of a wild night out to a soundtrack of Jeff Mills, DJ Rolando and Global Communication. But more than just an expression of primal energies, the performance plays with the perception of time. It seems to compress and distort \u2013 something clubbers might recognise from their own nights out \u2013 thanks to cinematic choreographic effects: freeze frames, looping repeats and brilliantly realised slow motion. \u201cIf you see Crowd live, audiences have said they feel a little bit different afterwards than before they came into the theatre, a slightly altered way of being,\u201d says Vienne. \u201cI think there is this double feeling of being very sharp \u2013 because it has slowed down you can see detail in a sharper way than usual \u2013 and then a little bit of this stoned feeling.\u201d In history, much ecstatic experience was linked to religion; Vienne points out that art, too, was mostly bound to religion. Its position in modern secular society is often confused with entertainment, she thinks. \u201cI think both are totally necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cEntertainment is crucial and art is crucial, but I just think the contract with the audience is different, you are looking for a different experience.\u201d So what does she want to provide with her own art? \u201cI think it\u2019s more on the level of spiritual experience,\u201d says Vienne. \u201cIt\u2019s questioning, it\u2019s self-reflecting, it\u2019s human-reflecting. It\u2019s an experience of philosophy in a physical way,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, I would put it that way: it\u2019s physical philosophy.\u201d Crowd is at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 8-9 October, as part of Dance Umbrella, and at Tramway, Glasgow, on 16 October.",

There is something lowering, to me at least, in resorting to your personal experience to make a point that shouldn\u2019t have to be made; in offering your very humanity and credibility as a professional to make an argument that should be believed without the need for these tithes. Comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/02/nish-kumar-reni-eddo-lodge-comedian-writer-race-staying-positive\" title=\"\">Nish Kumar</a>, commenting on the Munchetty debacle, said that racism is like gravity: it\u2019s not an opinion. To argue about racism feels like having to prove gravity exists. On the other hand, if not you, then who? It is uncomfortable: you will inevitably be told you are playing the race card, that you have a chip on your shoulder, that if you were really good at what you did you wouldn\u2019t have to keep banging on about race.</p> <p>These are the pitfalls of an industry, and a society as a whole, that seems to think of diversity as window-dressing, an exercise that produces the right optics without bringing about any real change. I call it Javid\u2019s law, where a non-white person is brought into the fold, then wheeled out to show how their very presence \u201cproves\u201d their employer is free from discrimination.</p> <p>Few do it with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/18/sajid-javid-puts-rivals-on-the-spot-over-tory-party-islamophobia\" title=\"\">as much gusto</a> and as unsubtly as Sajid Javid \u2013 who in his former role, when questioned about Islamophobia in the Conservative party, said: \u201cFor a start let\u2019s just have a look at who the home secretary is in this country. As you\u2019ve just described me, my name is Sajid Javid, I am the home secretary in this country.\u201d Under Javid\u2019s law one must always absolve others, and never call attention to legitimate grievances.</p> <p>It sometimes feels like a circular firing squad. The media trap minority journalists in a ghetto where they howl at the moon about race \u2013 reducing their experiences to a spectacle of pain that sits alongside the other news items on economics, foreign policy and sport, or silences them completely so they are present, but have no presence. It is doubly frustrating, with all these pressures already bearing down, that when someone such as Munchetty makes the most banal, obvious point about how being told to go back to where you came from is problematic, she is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/27/bbc-defends-censure-of-naga-munchetty-over-trump-comments\" title=\"\">taken to task</a> for breaking the calm exterior of \u201cprofessionalism\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for keeping your mouth shut.</p> <p>The reason we have this confused attitude towards the role people of colour can play is that, overwhelmingly, the gatekeepers of these discussions are white. Diversity is encouraged in the ranks below stairs, while those who get to rule on Munchetty, or decide whether there should be an inquiry into Tory party Islamophobia, for example, are far removed from the real-life consequences of their decisions. Esoteric adjudications about neutrality and professionalism do not apply to viscerally unambiguous topics such as racism.</p> <p>This discrepancy applies universally \u2013 whether to those from working-class backgrounds, women or LGBT people. As long as marginalised identities are brought in to boost diversity but are invisible in decision-making meetings, we will do little to change our culture and norms, and bring about real power redistribution.</p> <p>And here the tension rises in this very column. I will resist the temptation to offer my own little victimhood credibility nugget \u2013 after all, in this newspaper I have the privilege to write about whatever I wish. But whatever exception I enjoy does not disprove the rule \u2013 and I hope that you, dear reader, can also resist the impulse to demand I prove to you that gravity exists.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Comedian Nish Kumar, commenting on the Munchetty debacle, said that racism is like gravity: it\u2019s not an opinion. To argue about racism feels like having to prove gravity exists. On the other hand, if not you, then who? It is uncomfortable: you will inevitably be told you are playing the race card, that you have a chip on your shoulder, that if you were really good at what you did you wouldn\u2019t have to keep banging on about race. These are the pitfalls of an industry, and a society as a whole, that seems to think of diversity as window-dressing, an exercise that produces the right optics without bringing about any real change. I call it Javid\u2019s law, where a non-white person is brought into the fold, then wheeled out to show how their very presence \u201cproves\u201d their employer is free from discrimination. Few do it with as much gusto and as unsubtly as Sajid Javid \u2013 who in his former role, when questioned about Islamophobia in the Conservative party, said: \u201cFor a start let\u2019s just have a look at who the home secretary is in this country. As you\u2019ve just described me, my name is Sajid Javid, I am the home secretary in this country.\u201d Under Javid\u2019s law one must always absolve others, and never call attention to legitimate grievances. It sometimes feels like a circular firing squad. The media trap minority journalists in a ghetto where they howl at the moon about race \u2013 reducing their experiences to a spectacle of pain that sits alongside the other news items on economics, foreign policy and sport, or silences them completely so they are present, but have no presence. It is doubly frustrating, with all these pressures already bearing down, that when someone such as Munchetty makes the most banal, obvious point about how being told to go back to where you came from is problematic, she is taken to task for breaking the calm exterior of \u201cprofessionalism\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for keeping your mouth shut. The reason we have this confused attitude towards the role people of colour can play is that, overwhelmingly, the gatekeepers of these discussions are white. Diversity is encouraged in the ranks below stairs, while those who get to rule on Munchetty, or decide whether there should be an inquiry into Tory party Islamophobia, for example, are far removed from the real-life consequences of their decisions. Esoteric adjudications about neutrality and professionalism do not apply to viscerally unambiguous topics such as racism. This discrepancy applies universally \u2013 whether to those from working-class backgrounds, women or LGBT people. As long as marginalised identities are brought in to boost diversity but are invisible in decision-making meetings, we will do little to change our culture and norms, and bring about real power redistribution. And here the tension rises in this very column. I will resist the temptation to offer my own little victimhood credibility nugget \u2013 after all, in this newspaper I have the privilege to write about whatever I wish. But whatever exception I enjoy does not disprove the rule \u2013 and I hope that you, dear reader, can also resist the impulse to demand I prove to you that gravity exists. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

They come on top of an additional \u00a3400m in funding for FE and sixth-form colleges announced at the end of last month.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately I want to see all the regions in this country have a specialist maths school, I want every big city to have at least one great institute of technology that can act as a focus to drive forward technical and vocational qualifications, working closely with industry and higher education institutions,\u201d said Williamson.</p> <p>The new IoTs are to focus on the Stem subjects of science, technology and engineering, as a route to gain high-quality skills and technical qualifications. Each will have an industry specialism, with capital funding and a licence to call itself an institute of technology, awarded after a tender overseen by the Department for Education.</p> <p>The education secretary said the success of encouraging half of sixth formers in England to enter higher education shouldn\u2019t obscure the plight of the \u201cforgotten 50%\u201d who didn\u2019t do so, and to improve the sophistication of the courses open to them through further education.</p> <p>\u201cAll of this is based, quite simply, on the key fact that over the next 10 years we have got to be in a position where the quality of our technical and vocational education and training is matching that of Germany,\u201d said Williamson, who studied at Scarborough sixth form college in north Yorkshire.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made great strides for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds in terms of their educational attainment.

      "bodyText": "Vocational and technical training could become more popular than going to university, according to education secretary Gavin Williamson as he prepares to announce \u00a3120m in extra funding for a new wave of specialist institutes. Williamson will tell the Conservative party conference on Monday of plans to launch a further eight institutes of technology \u2013 a collaboration between further education (FE) colleges, universities and employers to offer higher level technical training \u2013 joining the 12 opening this year to rival higher education as an option for students. \u201cWhen we have implemented all the reforms in this sector, one of the great challenges is that people may see this route in higher demand than a conventional university route. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen in Singapore and we should have the same level of ambition in this country,\u201d Williamson told the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019m seeing evidence of it when I speak to young people, they are switching on to the fact that there are different options that are just as attractive as university.\u201d The education secretary will also announce new efforts to start specialist maths colleges for sixth formers, opening at least one in every region, following the success of the Exeter and King\u2019s College London maths schools. Williamson told the Guardian that the new institutes of technology (IoTs) were intended to end the sector\u2019s image as a poor relation. They come on top of an additional \u00a3400m in funding for FE and sixth-form colleges announced at the end of last month. \u201cUltimately I want to see all the regions in this country have a specialist maths school, I want every big city to have at least one great institute of technology that can act as a focus to drive forward technical and vocational qualifications, working closely with industry and higher education institutions,\u201d said Williamson. The new IoTs are to focus on the Stem subjects of science, technology and engineering, as a route to gain high-quality skills and technical qualifications. Each will have an industry specialism, with capital funding and a licence to call itself an institute of technology, awarded after a tender overseen by the Department for Education. The education secretary said the success of encouraging half of sixth formers in England to enter higher education shouldn\u2019t obscure the plight of the \u201cforgotten 50%\u201d who didn\u2019t do so, and to improve the sophistication of the courses open to them through further education. \u201cAll of this is based, quite simply, on the key fact that over the next 10 years we have got to be in a position where the quality of our technical and vocational education and training is matching that of Germany,\u201d said Williamson, who studied at Scarborough sixth form college in north Yorkshire. \u201cWe\u2019ve made great strides for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds in terms of their educational attainment. But it\u2019s not just about industry and having the right skills. This is about making sure that children, from whatever background they come from, have a opportunity to succeed in life in a way that sometimes people can only dream of.\u201d Among the first IoTs to be announced was the Institute of Technology North East, a collaboration between New College Durham, Newcastle University and Nissan. But the locations of the initial 12 IoTs, backed by capital funding of \u00a3170m, saw three in London but none in the north-west or east of England and none on the south-east coast, putting those areas first in line for the next wave. Williamson compared the mission of the new IoTs to the polytechnics and colleges of an earlier era, based on the needs of local economies: \u201cIn many ways this is going back to the roots of what all these great institutions were originally founded as, and we\u2019re putting the investment behind them.\u201d Unusually for an education secretary, Williamson has claimed the technical and vocational education brief for his own portfolio, and aims to establish a new skills and productivity board to advise him on the courses needed. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong if we are in a situation where we are selling people courses that aren\u2019t going to lead them into employment. The whole purpose of this is to drive up the level and type of courses that people are taking,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThe reason I am setting up a skills and productivity board is to focus on what the economy needs and how I can best spend money to equip people with those skills, so we are providing the employers of Britain with the people they need for the modern economy.\u201d England\u2019s more than 240 FE and sixth-form colleges educate more than a million young people up to the age of 24, many of them taking higher national diplomas or certificates. Williamson said the mood in cabinet remained positive and Boris Johnson had been \u201cincredibly supportive\u201d towards vocational and technical education. Asked about the Labour party conference\u2019s backing for taxing private schools and adding VAT to fees, Williamson said: \u201cI am not going to get dragged into ideological battles of the left and the Labour party. If the Labour party wants to bring ideology into the classroom then I think that\u2019s a bad move.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It has started to rain and the angry sky is threatening thunder, but a lone figure is picking his way through the rubble of Dhamar detention centre in Houthi-controlled northern Yemen. His name is Mustafa al-Adel. Although his brother Ahmed, a guard, died here when the site was recently hit by a ferocious airstrike, he is still employed to watch over the ruins. At night he sleeps in the least damaged building. He doesn\u2019t mind the rain, he says. It has washed away the blood. \u201cYou can see Ahmed\u2019s blue blanket up there,\u201d the 22-year-old said through a mouthful of the stimulant qat, pointing at the second floor of what used to be the guards\u2019 quarters. \u201cThere were 200 people here but now it\u2019s just ghosts.\u201d Adel is one of dozens of people the Guardian met on a rare 6,000km journey through Yemen\u2019s patchwork of Houthi-, government- and separatist-controlled areas, who described how more than four years of war have changed their lives beyond recognition. Suffering is palpable everywhere. But it is in the rebel-held highlands of Yemen\u2019s north that the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis has taken root and the spectres of cholera, hunger and Saudi airstrikes loom. The overnight attack on Dhamar on 1 September was the deadliest so far this year by the Saudi-led coalition of 20 Arab nations fighting to restore the deposed president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, according to the Yemen Data Project, a database tracking the war. Even by the standards of a conflict defined by indiscriminate bombing of civilians at markets, weddings and hospitals, the violence was shocking. At least 100 people died in what eyewitnesses said were seven strikes that pulverised the area. It took five days to remove all the bodies impaled on metalwork ripped from the walls in the blasts. As a community college campus turned into an informal detention centre, the Dhamar site should have been on the coalition\u2019s no-strike list. It was also an attack that targeted their own: about half of the prisoners were captured Hadi soldiers and half were civilians arrested by the Houthis, said a survivor, Ali Ahmed al-Abasi, 39, from his hospital bed. Pictures of the burnt and bloody faces of the dead are now on the wall near the entrance for families to come and identify. In some cases there are no faces left: just hands. \u201cThe Red Cross visited us three months ago,\u201d Abasi said. \u201cThere is no way the coalition didn\u2019t know we were there.\u201d The coalition denied it had struck a detention centre, saying it had hit a military site used by the Houthis for restoring drones and missiles. Strikes such as those on Dhamar that could constitute war crimes hit northern Yemen on an alarmingly regular basis. Saada province, the Houthi heartland on Saudi Arabia\u2019s border, is targeted the most. Barely a street in the town of the same name has been left untouched: the post office, central market and countless civilian homes are gone. Death comes from above at any time. Over a lunch of chicken, rice and sweet honeyed fatteh, the unmistakable thud of a nearby missile shook the windows of a restaurant. The diners paid no attention to the whine of the Saudi warplane even as it circled back for a second, third and fourth hit. The scorched earth strategy has not brought Saudi Arabia any closer to winning this war. Its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, then defence minister, launched Operation Decisive Storm in March 2015 after the Iran-backed Houthis took the capital Sana\u2019a, forcing Hadi to flee to Riyadh. However, the Houthis \u2013 officially known as Ansar Allah - are an experienced decades-old guerrilla movement. With the help of Tehran, they now possess sophisticated drone technology and can launch cross-border rocket attacks deep into Saudi Arabia, targeting assets such as oilfields, military bases and airports. Footage of heroic Houthi exploits loops endlessly on the rebel al-Masirah television channel, and Houthi battle songs, known as zawamil, are so catchy even loyalist troops like to play them. The lyrics taunt Prince Mohammed with promises of more Houthi gifts sent over the border. Some now call Yemen Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vietnam. But the truth is, without a steady supply of weapons, vehicles and technical expertise provided by the UK, US and other western nations, the current stalemate would be even worse for Riyadh. Yemenis are well aware of where the bombs that fall on their heads originate from. Technical information and serial numbers from missile parts that survive explosions can easily be traced to western arms manufacturers. At the bomb and mine clearance agency in Sana\u2019a, weapons parts recovered from airstrikes glow hot in the sun. Among them are motor parts from four sensors from cluster bombs \u2013 explosives illegal under international law because the submunitions inside released on impact cause indiscriminate harm over a large area. The labels say they were made by the US Goodrich Corporation and manufactured in Wolverhampton, UK. Goodrich ceased operations in 2012 and it is not known if at the time of manufacture, which could predate the cluster bomb ban, the parts were intended for use in a bomb or later taken into one. Collins Aerospace, formed after Goodrich\u2019s parent company merged its subsidiaries, still operates from the Wolverhampton site. Aside from waves of airstrikes, life in Sana\u2019a \u2013 a city famous for its charming 2,500-year-old architecture, resembling tall gingerbread houses \u2013 appears normal on the surface. The Houthis have done a good job of routing al-Qaida from their territory and the streets are cleaner and more orderly than anywhere else in the country. The relative calm comes at a price: according to Mwatana, one of the only human rights groups still operating, dissenters are routinely imprisoned and tortured, and the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed religious minority have been persecuted as Israeli spies. The Saudi blockade of Houthi Yemen\u2019s airspace and land and sea borders keeps the north on a constant knife edge. The Houthi leadership in Sana\u2019a has secured supply lines overland from Oman, a diplomatic source said, meaning they can cling on. But ordinary Yemenis are suffering greatly. The markets in Sana\u2019a are full of produce, but the collapsed economy means food and fuel are now twice as expensive as before the war. Eighty percent of the population \u2013 some 24 million people \u2013 are now dependent on aid to survive. Half of that number are on the brink of famine. The UN says by the end of the year the combined death toll from fighting and disease will be 230,000, or 0.8% of the country. Every hospital in the city is overflowing with malnutrition and cholera patients from families in neighbouring provinces who have scraped together the cash to send loved ones for adequate treatment in the capital. At al-Sabeen women and children\u2019s hospital, Jamila Mohammed Hamad, 36, says cholera now visits her family every year when the rainy season starts. She lost her three-year-old girl last summer. Now she is back in al-Sabeen\u2019s cholera reception tent, praying her two-year-old niece survives. The little girl, Qasima, was lying on her back gazing blankly at the tent\u2019s ceiling, sweat plastering her curly hair to her forehead. Men are dying too. Green and flowery posters of those killed fighting and innocents lost to airstrikes cover the walls of homes, businesses, cars and street signs, Hezbollah-style. The pictures of \u201cmartyrs\u201d are accompanied by the Houthi sarkha, or scream, which is stencilled in red and green on almost every surface: \u201cGod is great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curses on the Jews, Victory to Islam.\u201d The Houthis began life in the 1990s as a religious protest movement born in opposition to Riyadh\u2019s attempts to spread Wahhabism, the ultraconservative Sunni Islamic doctrine, over the border in Yemen\u2019s Zaydi Shia lands. While at failed peace talks their political agenda appears muddled, they have evolved into a sophisticated military organisation. As the Saudi blockades and air campaign have strangled the life out of entire communities, sympathy for the Houthi cause among many in the north has deepened. Unable to feed their families as work dries up and inflation soars, some men feel they have no choice but to join the movement and draw a fighter\u2019s salary of $100 (\u00a381) a month. Nowhere is the injustice more keenly felt than in Dahyan, the small village in Saada where a year ago a Saudi airstrike targeted a bus full of little boys on their way to a school trip, killing 44. A piece of the missile seen by the Guardian identified it as a MK-82 bomb. Munitions experts have said it was a laser-guided Paveway, manufactured by the US company Lockheed Martin. Lockheed deferred questions to the Pentagon and US State department. The State Department said it had no comment. At the site of the attack, 44 small faces now peer down from a banner strung across the street, next to a mural which says: \u201cAmerica kills Yemeni children.\u201d In the village cemetery, the children\u2019s graves have become something of a pilgrimage site. Twelve-year-old Yusuf al-Amir almost went on the fateful trip: now he visits his friends\u2019 graves most afternoons after school. Taking his jambiya, a Yemeni ceremonial dagger, from his belt, he cut away a plastic sheet to reveal the twisted skeleton of the bus, which now rests next to the children. A Saudi jet roared overhead as he talked about missing his friends. In the martyrs\u2019 section of the cemetery, there are two freshly dug graves. The groundskeeper said he was not expecting any green-clad funeral parties today. But he knows more will come.",

      "bodyText": "Thailand could be the next nation in south-east Asia to relocate its capital after Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha hinted such a move could be a \u201cpossibility\u201d under his government. Taking inspiration from neighbouring Myanmar and similar plans being formulated in Indonesia, the Thai prime minister suggested that relocating the capital could help Bangkok overcome its mounting urban challenges. Like Jakarta, Bangkok is beset by overcrowding, pollution, rising sea levels and heavy traffic congestion. During an address at the Connecting Thailand with the World Conference on 18 September, the retired army general floated two options for a potential move. \u201cThe first is to find a city that\u2019s neither too far nor too expensive to move to,\u201d he said, \u201cThe second is to move to outer Bangkok to reduce crowding.\u201d The Thai prime minister suggested that moving the government to the outskirts of Bangkok could help ease traffic flows and reduce the need to commute in and out of the city centre. Comprehensive research and studies into the social and economic impacts of such a move would be required, he added, but noted that such a move could be a \u201cpossibility\u201d under his government. The suggestion comes weeks after Indonesian president Joko Widodo announced the administrative capital would be moved from beleaguered Jakarta to East Kalimantan, or Indonesian Borneo. It is not the first time the idea of moving Thailand\u2019s administrative capital has been raised, with former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra also suggesting the administrative capital be moved to Nakhon Nayok, a province 100km from the capital. Studies have also been conducted on shifting government offices to Chachoengsao, an agricultural hub to the east of Bangkok. As with Jakarta, the idea of moving the capital has drawn mixed reviews, and doubts about whether such a plan would materialise. Thosaporn Sirisamphand, from Thailand\u2019s National Economic and Social Development Council, told the Bangkok Post the prime minister was yet to ask the agency to seriously study the possibility, and that his recent suggestion may have been an on-the-cuff remark. \u201cCapital relocation is a big issue and needs serious cooperation from various agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cI think General Prayut just threw an idea out to the public on how to tackle traffic congestion in Bangkok.\u201d According to a 2018 study on the world\u2019s worst traffic, Bangkok was ranked eighth, one place behind Jakarta, for its road congestion levels, with Mumbai first. Experts have suggested the government should first conduct studies on ways to reduce traffic congestion in Bangkok, and focus on development in second-tier provinces.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian government kept documents about its multibillion-dollar submarine project secret from the public to avoid offending a foreign power, and spent $150,000 over four years to stop their release. Australia\u2019s growing involvement in the international arms trade is frequently shrouded in secrecy. The government has routinely blocked freedom of information requests for documents on arms deals, including weapons exports to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, by citing national security or potential harm to international relations. The secrecy has extended to major arms purchases \u2013 including of the new $50bn submarine fleet \u2013 which have helped make Australia one of the biggest arms importers in the world. Data released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute on Monday shows Australia is now the world\u2019s second biggest arms importer behind only Saudi Arabia, up from fourth the year prior. In 2015, Senator Nick Xenophon and later his successor, Rex Patrick, used FOI law to seek unclassified documents showing the process Australia used to award the submarine contract to French company DCNS. The decision had embarrassed the Japanese government, a rival bidder to DCNS, and left key Japanese officials feeling \u201craw\u201d, according to one diplomat, who said it contributed to \u201ca precarious time in Australia\u2019s relationship with Japan\u201d. Xenophon\u2019s FOI request was initially denied, in part because it would harm relations with Japan, and the case ended up in the administrative appeals tribunal in 2017. Correspondence between the Australian and Japanese governments show how Australian officials approached the head of the Japanese defence ministry\u2019s weapons and warship division, informing him that an Australian politician was seeking documents about the submarine project. The documents were relatively standard tender records, and many had already been made public. The documents were not sensitive or classified and did not specifically relate to Japan\u2019s bid. All three bidders for the submarine project were forewarned about Australia\u2019s FOI laws, and the two other bidders, including DCNS, had raised no objection to Xenophon\u2019s request. Japan asked Australia not to release the documents, including \u2013 initially at least \u2013 material that was already publicly available. When asked why it would be harmful to release documents already in the public realm, the senior Australian diplomat Graham Fletcher, told the tribunal: \u201cIf the information is out there the material damage is perhaps less but that\u2019s not really the question, the question is will our relationship with Japan be damaged, if we override their objection or disregard and then release the information. And based on my knowledge our relationship will be damaged.\u201d \u201cIt would reopen some sensitivities about the whole history of this issue, which we hope to put behind us.\u201d The defence department this month won the tribunal case, although they were ordered to release some additional documents to Patrick. Patrick told Guardian Australia he had unsuccessfully sought a meeting with Japan\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Sumio Kasaka, about the issue. \u201cI have seen the documents that are being withheld from release and I am of the strong view that Japan is being rather precious and somewhat disrespectful to Australia\u2019s principles of transparency over their release,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe decision raises questions as to whether we should invite Japan to tender for future defence projects. \u201cIt cannot be the case that, just because Japan tenders for a contract, Australians are then not permitted to the transparency over public expenditure that they are supposed to enjoy.\u201d The defence department acknowledged the tribunal\u2019s decision and said it accorded with its views on the release of the documents. \u201cThe tribunal\u2019s decision aligns with the views of defence, specifically that it was necessary to protect the competitive evaluation process in order to uphold the strong standing of our international relationships,\u201d a spokeswoman said. The department said it would release information that has otherwise been made public since the original FOI request four years ago. \u201cSince the original FOI request, which was made on 21 September 2015 while the competitive evaluation process was still underway, some information has become publicly available in the ordinary course of announcements, this includes [Australian national audit office] audits and proceedings such as senate estimates.\u201d \u201cDefence will release the publicly available information which was identified during the proceedings, in accordance with the tribunal\u2019s decision.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Pre-tournament, Michael Cheika said he would adopt a horses-for-courses selection policy at this World Cup, but for the Wallabies\u2019 crunch Pool D game against Wales in Tokyo, he backed the wrong horse. The coach\u2019s master-plan fell apart and perhaps it is time to look at Plan B. Wallabies selectors made four changes to the starting team that beat Fiji 39-21 in their opening game in Sapporo last Sunday, all in the backline. Cheika flipped his halves combination, replacing Nic White and Christian Lealiifano with Will Genia and Bernard Foley for the Wales game. Dane Haylett-Petty also displaced Kurtley Beale at fullback, while Adam Ashley-Cooper took over from the suspended Reece Hodge. With the exception of Ashley-Cooper for Hodge, it seemed the changes were pre-planned rather than based on form. Foley did not play against Fiji, not even off the bench. But without any form as a guide Foley started in a crucial playmaking position in a game that may well have determined the Wallabies\u2019 fate at this tournament. If the selection had been made on form alone Matt Toomua would have started against Wales after playing so strongly off the bench against Fiji, an effort he repeated in the Wallabies\u2019 heart-breaking 29-25 loss. But the decision to flip the halves backfired on the Wallabies, who lacked cohesion in the first-half and allowed Wales to build a commanding 23-8 lead. As they promised, the Welsh targeted Foley, who was guilty of throwing some wild passes under pressure, adding to the general confusion in the Wallabies\u2019 attack as the handling errors which have bedevilled this team for the last four years continued to plague them. He was hooked in just the fourth minute of the second half, a tacit admission that the selection was wrong. Toomua came on and made an immediate impact, making a break and then having a second involvement in a movement that led to Haylett-Petty\u2019s try in the 45th minute. It put the Wallabies back in the game. White made a belated entrance in the 52nd minute when he replaced a tiring Genia, who had thrown a long pass that was intercepted by Wales halfback Gareth Davies and led to a decisive try just before half-time. The Wallabies won the second half 17-6, which was no mean feat against the Six Nations champions and served as a reminder of the great things this team is capable of, but the selections have to be spot on \u2013particularly at five-eighth, which has been Australia\u2019s problem position for over a year. Australia are still in this tournament, but they must now take the more difficult road through the knockout stage. Assuming the Wallabies defeat minnows Uruguay and Georgia in their remaining Pool D games, they are likely to meet England in a quarter-final. After slow starts against both Fiji and Wales, the Wallabies must figure out how to play as well at the start of the game as they have at the end. They cannot afford to give a team as strong as England such a big head-start. Toomua has to come under serious consideration to start in the quarter-final. He has played better than both Lealiifano and Foley, albeit coming off the bench. He may not have the silky passing skills of that pair but he runs hard and strong at the defensive line and is a solid defender. He is also a good goal-kicker.

Yet while they have played entertaining footy, Canberra\u2019s games may have been too for entertaining for their fans \u2013 and their hyper-competitive coach \u2013 given their D-line could tend to the porous, particularly under pressure.</p> <p>No more. The Raiders were bombarded by Souths at old Bruce Stadium on Friday evening and weathered six repeat sets of six including four in a row. They lost their fullback to the sin bin with 11 minutes to play. The injured James Roberts may have given Souths the incision they needed, yet Souths\u2019 best player Cody Walker was a constant threat and the Raiders held him and 16 other cardinal-and-myrtle marauders to 10 points, four of them arriving when the game was gone.</p> <p>It was the biggest game of rugby league played in Canberra. The Viking Clap brought them out, and a full house of lime green-clad people roared them home. The players defended their line as if from home invasion.</p> <p>Ironically the Raiders\u2019 much-vaunted attack was not in gear. Yet when they were out of ideas they just gave the ball to Josh Papalii who made several storming carries, with \u201ccarry\u201d the operative word given he\u2019d take two and three Souths players with him. His try in the 73rd minute sent his teammates into a pile-on akin to Richmond upon the AFL\u2019s grand final siren a day later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1db86ca9201830e00d72b904c4a002fbd82f13f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1db86ca9201830e00d72b904c4a002fbd82f13f/0_0_4453_3180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Papalii\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Papalii is mobbed after scoring at GIO Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendon Thorne/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Papalli makes his teammates better. He draws in defenders, slips an arm free and gifts space to the likes of Josh Hodgson, Jack Wighton and the Raiders cast of players light on their feet. His quick play-the-ball is key for Hodgson, the Raiders captain.</p> <p>Hodgson was immense on Friday. In the first half he was stunned in a tackle that saw him stumbling. It looked HIA 101 yet he stayed on the field to set up a try and save another \u2013&#xa0;he stripped the ball from the dangerous Walker as the five-eighth was falling over the line to score, a remarkable feat of movement and spatial awareness at speed. </p> <p>The Raiders\u2019 defence was inspired by a record crowd in Canberra, but a day later in Sydney the Roosters defence was more: that\u2019s just how they play. It is tight, committed, swarming and they all buy in. The edict was no better illustrated than by their halfback, Cooper Cronk, who made clutch try-saving tackles before charging down field. He is 36 in December and one of the Roosters\u2019 most vital cogs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/28/roosters-book-a-place-in-nrl-grand-final-after-defeating-storm\">Roosters book a place in NRL grand final after defeating Storm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cronk has now made nine grand finals in 15 seasons. If the Roosters win on Sunday he will have won the last three in a row. Glenn Lazarus played five in a row with the Raiders and Broncos (and a sixth one at Storm). Lazarus is in the pantheon of props and Cronk must be included in any conversation of great No 7s. He will be a story all week.</p> <p>James Tedesco is the best player in the game despite Stuart\u2019s assertion that it is Papalii. The Roosters fullback saved a try at one end, scored a try at the other. And if Canberra are to win their first premiership in 25 years they must nullify Tedesco. And Cronk. And Luke Keary wouldn\u2019t hurt either, though his leg injury will be monitored all week.</p> <p>Keary did manage to escape punishment outside a $1,500 fine for tearing a fist-full of hair from Felise Kaufusi\u2019s head before whacking him across the jaw with a swinging arm that forced the Storm backrower from the field, never to return. It was later revealed Kaufusi had passed the HIA yet suffered a rib injury. Keary appears to have benefited from the unofficial grand final rule that saw Billy Slater play in last year\u2019s decider and Papalii play in this one.</p> <p>Certainly Papalii\u2019s shot on Adam Doueihi rocked the jaw of the Souths custodian. Yet the gods of rugby league have been kind to Papalli, as they were to Keary and Slater. Papali\u2019s match-up against Jared Warea-Hargreaves on Sunday evening will be one of several match-defining contests. Ricky Stuart versus the world will not be one of them.</p>",

The Raiders have always been known as a destination for crack attacking players and the club is consequently many fans\u2019 \u201csecond team\u201d, just as North Queensland Cowboys were during the Matt Bowen era. Yet while they have played entertaining footy, Canberra\u2019s games may have been too for entertaining for their fans \u2013 and their hyper-competitive coach \u2013 given their D-line could tend to the porous, particularly under pressure. No more. The Raiders were bombarded by Souths at old Bruce Stadium on Friday evening and weathered six repeat sets of six including four in a row. They lost their fullback to the sin bin with 11 minutes to play. The injured James Roberts may have given Souths the incision they needed, yet Souths\u2019 best player Cody Walker was a constant threat and the Raiders held him and 16 other cardinal-and-myrtle marauders to 10 points, four of them arriving when the game was gone. It was the biggest game of rugby league played in Canberra. The Viking Clap brought them out, and a full house of lime green-clad people roared them home. The players defended their line as if from home invasion. Ironically the Raiders\u2019 much-vaunted attack was not in gear. Yet when they were out of ideas they just gave the ball to Josh Papalii who made several storming carries, with \u201ccarry\u201d the operative word given he\u2019d take two and three Souths players with him. His try in the 73rd minute sent his teammates into a pile-on akin to Richmond upon the AFL\u2019s grand final siren a day later. Papalli makes his teammates better. He draws in defenders, slips an arm free and gifts space to the likes of Josh Hodgson, Jack Wighton and the Raiders cast of players light on their feet. His quick play-the-ball is key for Hodgson, the Raiders captain. Hodgson was immense on Friday. In the first half he was stunned in a tackle that saw him stumbling. It looked HIA 101 yet he stayed on the field to set up a try and save another \u2013 he stripped the ball from the dangerous Walker as the five-eighth was falling over the line to score, a remarkable feat of movement and spatial awareness at speed. The Raiders\u2019 defence was inspired by a record crowd in Canberra, but a day later in Sydney the Roosters defence was more: that\u2019s just how they play. It is tight, committed, swarming and they all buy in. The edict was no better illustrated than by their halfback, Cooper Cronk, who made clutch try-saving tackles before charging down field. He is 36 in December and one of the Roosters\u2019 most vital cogs. Cronk has now made nine grand finals in 15 seasons. If the Roosters win on Sunday he will have won the last three in a row. Glenn Lazarus played five in a row with the Raiders and Broncos (and a sixth one at Storm). Lazarus is in the pantheon of props and Cronk must be included in any conversation of great No 7s. He will be a story all week. James Tedesco is the best player in the game despite Stuart\u2019s assertion that it is Papalii. The Roosters fullback saved a try at one end, scored a try at the other. And if Canberra are to win their first premiership in 25 years they must nullify Tedesco. And Cronk. And Luke Keary wouldn\u2019t hurt either, though his leg injury will be monitored all week. Keary did manage to escape punishment outside a $1,500 fine for tearing a fist-full of hair from Felise Kaufusi\u2019s head before whacking him across the jaw with a swinging arm that forced the Storm backrower from the field, never to return. It was later revealed Kaufusi had passed the HIA yet suffered a rib injury. Keary appears to have benefited from the unofficial grand final rule that saw Billy Slater play in last year\u2019s decider and Papalii play in this one. Certainly Papalii\u2019s shot on Adam Doueihi rocked the jaw of the Souths custodian. Yet the gods of rugby league have been kind to Papalli, as they were to Keary and Slater. Papali\u2019s match-up against Jared Warea-Hargreaves on Sunday evening will be one of several match-defining contests. Ricky Stuart versus the world will not be one of them.",

She is also inveigling herself very publicly into the affections of Logan, putting on an event for him in his hometown of Dundee, Scotland, to mark the 50th anniversary of his life\u2019s work. She has even arranged a surprise party. Everyone will be there. However, amid all the sycophancy of the tributes paid, he must endure some damning home truths from those close to him.</p> <p>Passing a bandstand on a drive through Dundee, Logan finds himself reminiscing on the death of his mother, but his broken dialogue \u2013 \u201cit was so complicated \u2026 I don\u2019t know what it was \u2026 what they say, you know\u2026\u201d \u2013 suggests a man with barely any vestige of soul who is perturbed by the past. He would clearly rather be someplace else. Lovers of Citizen Kane might suspect he is fixating on the bandstand as a symbol of his humble origins, but the writers slap that down. \u201cRosebud \u2013 is a dollar bill \u2013 whatever it took to get me the fuck out of here.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Shiv is the most agitated by \u201ctraitorous viper\u201d Rhea and attempts to drum up support from her brothers to repel her. But they are indifferent to her calls for a family truce, more amused by Shiv\u2019s annoyance than angered at the usurper. She gets similarly short shrift when she tries to enlist Marcia, who knows full well what Shiv is up to and makes her own quiet threat to her: \u201cWhen I lose, the other one will generally lose an eye or so.\u201d Kendall does his bit by having her mention in a toast to Logan his \u201csister Rose\u201d. Rose? This, evidently, does not go down well with the old man.</p> <p>Rhea makes her own rounds, by suggesting to Roman that they go into partnership \u2013 but is rebuffed with a succinct \u201cFuck off\u201d \u2013 then by trying to flatter Kendall. But he is too busy with Jennifer, the star in Willa\u2019s dismal-looking new theatre show, and brushes her off too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b7b964b295c98228bfe629a96336279c1c4ea6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b7b964b295c98228bfe629a96336279c1c4ea6e/0_265_7212_4327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Cox as Logan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s a persuasive argument to be made that he\u2019s worse than Hitler\u2019 ... Brian Cox as Logan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Home Box Office</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Gerri\u2019s behest, Roman makes a move of his own, seeking out Eduard in a local pub where he is engrossed in what Roman dismisses as \u201cScottish kickyball\u201d on the TV. Eduard suggests they buy Hearts FC \u2013 a little present for the old man, a longtime football fan. Sadly, Roman\u2019s ignorance of football kicks him in the ass. Logan is a lifelong fan of Hearts\u2019 bitter rivals Hibernian. He could not have made a worse error.</p> <p>Logan\u2019s brother, Greg\u2019s grandfather, has turned up at the banquet, a living ghost of reproach to Logan. He also has a message for Greg; leave Waystar or be cut out of the will. Ewan\u2019s condemnation of Logan is a reminder, amid all its familial intrigue, that Waystar\u2019s day-to-day business reflects the actual existing, media-driven horrors of this world. They are toxic on a global scale. \u201cHe\u2019s morally bankrupt. He\u2019s a nothing man who may be more responsible for the death of this planet than any other single human being \u2026 there\u2019s a persuasive argument to be made that he is worse than Hitler.\u201d Greg gulps. But when he tries to submit his resignation to Logan, he tells him his brother is a \u201cfucking coward\u201d.<br><br>The centrepiece of the party\u2019s tributes is \u2013 oh, but it is \u2013 a rap by Kendall which has Roman climbing up the wall in embarrassment. It\u2019s not the rap itself so much \u2013 as bad TV drama raps go, it\u2019s pretty good \u2013 but the grovelling depths it plumbs.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Succession season two, which airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episode eight. \u2018He\u2019s made a wasteland \u2013 and called it an empire\u2019 Rhea has shown some brazenness to insinuate herself into pole position for the CEO position at Waystar ahead of the siblings. She is also inveigling herself very publicly into the affections of Logan, putting on an event for him in his hometown of Dundee, Scotland, to mark the 50th anniversary of his life\u2019s work. She has even arranged a surprise party. Everyone will be there. However, amid all the sycophancy of the tributes paid, he must endure some damning home truths from those close to him. Passing a bandstand on a drive through Dundee, Logan finds himself reminiscing on the death of his mother, but his broken dialogue \u2013 \u201cit was so complicated \u2026 I don\u2019t know what it was \u2026 what they say, you know\u2026\u201d \u2013 suggests a man with barely any vestige of soul who is perturbed by the past. He would clearly rather be someplace else. Lovers of Citizen Kane might suspect he is fixating on the bandstand as a symbol of his humble origins, but the writers slap that down. \u201cRosebud \u2013 is a dollar bill \u2013 whatever it took to get me the fuck out of here.\u201d Meanwhile, Shiv is the most agitated by \u201ctraitorous viper\u201d Rhea and attempts to drum up support from her brothers to repel her. But they are indifferent to her calls for a family truce, more amused by Shiv\u2019s annoyance than angered at the usurper. She gets similarly short shrift when she tries to enlist Marcia, who knows full well what Shiv is up to and makes her own quiet threat to her: \u201cWhen I lose, the other one will generally lose an eye or so.\u201d Kendall does his bit by having her mention in a toast to Logan his \u201csister Rose\u201d. Rose? This, evidently, does not go down well with the old man. Rhea makes her own rounds, by suggesting to Roman that they go into partnership \u2013 but is rebuffed with a succinct \u201cFuck off\u201d \u2013 then by trying to flatter Kendall. But he is too busy with Jennifer, the star in Willa\u2019s dismal-looking new theatre show, and brushes her off too. At Gerri\u2019s behest, Roman makes a move of his own, seeking out Eduard in a local pub where he is engrossed in what Roman dismisses as \u201cScottish kickyball\u201d on the TV. Eduard suggests they buy Hearts FC \u2013 a little present for the old man, a longtime football fan. Sadly, Roman\u2019s ignorance of football kicks him in the ass. Logan is a lifelong fan of Hearts\u2019 bitter rivals Hibernian. He could not have made a worse error. Logan\u2019s brother, Greg\u2019s grandfather, has turned up at the banquet, a living ghost of reproach to Logan. He also has a message for Greg; leave Waystar or be cut out of the will. Ewan\u2019s condemnation of Logan is a reminder, amid all its familial intrigue, that Waystar\u2019s day-to-day business reflects the actual existing, media-driven horrors of this world. They are toxic on a global scale. \u201cHe\u2019s morally bankrupt. He\u2019s a nothing man who may be more responsible for the death of this planet than any other single human being \u2026 there\u2019s a persuasive argument to be made that he is worse than Hitler.\u201d Greg gulps. But when he tries to submit his resignation to Logan, he tells him his brother is a \u201cfucking coward\u201d. The centrepiece of the party\u2019s tributes is \u2013 oh, but it is \u2013 a rap by Kendall which has Roman climbing up the wall in embarrassment. It\u2019s not the rap itself so much \u2013 as bad TV drama raps go, it\u2019s pretty good \u2013 but the grovelling depths it plumbs. Is all of this part of some long, strategic game, or a conscious act of submission to his father by a fatally weakened son? Marcia, too, has seemed steadfastly loyal to Logan, but tonight we realise that her recent marginalisation has galled her deeply. Logan has used his speech to announce his successor. He said nothing to her about stepping aside, she hisses, then stalks off. His brother then sidles up and refers to Rose \u2013 a \u201cRosebud\u201d in reverse, it seems \u2013 to whom he feels remorseful for some action earlier in his life. \u201cAll those years blaming yourself for Rose \u2013 that wasn\u2019t your fault. This empire of shit \u2013 this is your fault.\u201d Damnation of an Ozymandias-in-waiting on an epic scale. The heir apparent? That\u2019s obvious enough. Rhea, who Logan announces as his successor, despite confiding his misgivings about her to Shiv. And Shiv is pretty cool about it. Why? Because she has just been in a huddle with Gerri, Cyd, Frank and others in which they discuss an emerging crisis with a former Parks employee who is threatening to spill the beans about malfeasance there, is refusing any amount of hush money, probably has a backer, and is about to spill all on TV. \u201cAny new (CEO) face is going to get ripped to shreds,\u201d says Gerri. Shiv can live with that. Notes and observations Coincidentally, Logan actor Brian Cox was born in Dundee, albeit eight years later than Logan, in 1946. Given that, it\u2019s strange that Logan should support Hibernian, when he had not one but two local teams to choose from \u2013 Dundee and Dundee United. Connor\u2019s presidential bid seems to have run temporarily out of steam. This week, he is reduced to trying to tap his Dad for funds for Willa\u2019s moneypit of a theatre production.
