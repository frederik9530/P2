      "bodyText": "It was an intriguing tie-break, which saw Zverev double fault but he did fight back to move into a 4-2 lead. The German got the job done in the end but he will not forget this match in a hurry. Good night! The fourth set is heading to a tie-break after Zverev cruises through his service game. Bedene\u2019s new feet power him to break Zverev and then hold on his own serve. Bedene is having a medical timeout as his feet look quite knacked. Bedene takes it to deuce but Zverev holds his nerve and serve to make it 2-2 in the fourth. Zverev battles through to take his second set and Bedene wanders off for a break. Fewer for problems for Zverev in the third set as he leads 4-1 against Bedene. He seemed to hurt himself after stretching for a shot, losing his racket in the process, so hopefully that won\u2019t be too much of a burden. In other news ... Medvedev was fined \u00a34,100 ($5,000) for unsportsmanlike conduct and \u00a33,300 ($4,000) for a visible obscenity after his win over Feliciano Lopez. Here\u2019s the story of that match ... Zverev has equalled things up in terms of sets against Bedene but was taken to deuce in his opening service game of the second. Chung has played some incredible strokes throughout but he just could not compete with Nadal who has won the match in straight sets, 6-3. 6-4, 6-2. Nadal breaks Chung to lead 2-1 in the third (and probably final) set. Zverev v Bedene is going with serve in the second. Nadal serves for the second set and is about as clinical as you can get. He takes it and now leads the match 2-0. Bedene wins the first set on a tie-break against Zverev. Could we have a shock on our hands? Nadal breaks Chung and follows it up with some good work from the back of the court, which helps him hold his own service game to go 4-2 up in the second set. Zverev was serving for the set, but is now at 5-3 up, having been broken by Bedene, and appears to be heading down to his own private hell. That happens a lot. Nadal is now at 2-2 in the second set with Chung. It is going with serve. Zverev climbs up to 5-2 but is having something of a contretemps with the umpire; he is someone who plays on the edge. Zverev has been cut back to 4-2 by Bedene after a marathon sixth game in which the German failed to force another break. Nadal takes the first set 6-3 by serving an ace far beyond the wingspan of Chung. Zverev, who has never been further than the quarter-final of a major, is 4-1 up on Aljaz Bedene of Slovenia, and looking in fine fettle. Nadal, meanwhile, is serving for the first set. Nadal now has his break, and has gone to 4-2 up on his bespectacled opponent. Nadal is 3-2 up on Chung, though yet to break his Korean opponent. At the Louis Armstrong Stadium, it\u2019s Alexander Zverev v Aljaz Bedene, with the German 1-0 up in the first set. There are emotions aplenty for Kristie Ahn, who has beaten Jelena Ostapenko. There are tears and big smiles, especially when that heavily bandaged knee problem is mentioned. \u201cKeep \u2018em coming,\u201d she says. Nadal is on court, and will serve first; he serves to love to win the first game. Ahn, by the way, is 4-5 with Ostapenko in that second set but it\u2019s going with serve. Some heroics from Ahn, who wins the next game after that injury on her serve. Over at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, it\u2019s time for Rafa Nadal and his game with the South Korean Chung Hyeon. The two are warming up as the knock-up begins. Oh dear, trouble for Ahn, who is laid out on the court and in pain, having slipped and jarred something as she chased down a ball. She is having a medical time-out. That finishes with her stood up, and with a large bandage around her knee. The time-out ticks to its end with her looking rather less than comfortable. Ahn v Ostapenko is going with serve in the second set at 2-2, with Ahn having won the first set 2-2. And Wozniacki is out after Bianca Andreescu served out to win the match 6-4 6-4. \u201cIt was super fun,\u201d says the Canadian teenager. And what that means in the Arthur Ashe Stadium is that Rafa Nadal will be coming up next. Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski are through, with Murray Major hitting an ace to win the match 6-3 6-4 against uan Ignacio Londero and Ricardas Berankis. Wozniacki\u2019s revival did not last too long, as she was broken immediately by Andreescu and is back staring at the abyss. Ahn, though, is putting off that office job as she is a set up on Ostapenko, having won that 6-3 and now has a break and is 2-0 up in the second. Wozniacki is not done yet, not at all. She has fought back to 3-3 in the second set Ahn and Ostapenko is going with serve, as Ahn is serving at 3-4 down in the first. Wozniacki is fighting back, but is still 3-1 down to Andreescu. Andreescu is 2-0 up in the second set, and looking set fair to go to the fourth round. Even before Wozniacki suffered that injury, the Canadian was the better player. Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski are 5-3 up in their doubles match with Juan Ignacio Londero and Ricardas Berankis, that Argentinian-Lithuanian alliance. Woz is receiving treatment to what looks a heavily bandaged right ankle. The trainer is out there and the Dane looks to be in some pain, having slipped while reaching for a backhand at the back of the court. She came to a sudden stop and is having her foot manipulated. And Andreescu has taken the first set, 6-4. Wozniacki has a real game on her hands here. Ahn and Ostapenko are underway and at 1-1. Coming up on the Grandstand court, Kristie Ahn v Je\u013cena Ostapenko. Ahn, the American, has a decent story to tell. That Wozniacki game is back with serve, as she is 3-4 down to Andreescu. Taylor Townsend serves for the match, 5-2 up in the second set and gets the job done. \u201cI\u2019m going to ride this thing all the way,\u201d she says as she celebrates getting into the second week. How does she celebrate? Skipping, with a rope. Wozniacki was a break down to Andreescu, who was on it from the start but they are now at 2-2. To nobody\u2019s great surprise, Elise Mertens made short work of Andrea Petkovic, winning 6-3 6-3. As Wozniacki completes her preliminaries, Mertens is 4-2 up on Petkovic and Townsend is 2-0 up on Cirstea and looking set fair for victory. Wozniacki is just about to take to the stage at the Arthur Ashe, and she faces a tough opponent in the teenage Canadian. Townsend, by the way, won the first set 7-5 against Cirstea and they have just begin the second. Tumaini Carayol on the latest tennis bad boy. It\u2019s 5-5 between Townsend and Cirstea now. They cannot be separated. And in the other live game in the women\u2019s singles, Mertens has a 2-0 lead in the second set on Petkovic, having won the first set. Mertens takes the first set against Petkovic, 6-3, the damage done with that pair of early breaks. Townsend and Cirstea continue to slug it out at 4-4. It\u2019s exhausting to watch, never mind play. Townsend levels to make it 3-3 with a crashing overhead shot. It\u2019s a popular winner among what is still a sparse crowd in the Louis Armstrong court. Question: was Louis Armstrong a tennis fan? I know the court was named after him as a Queen\u2019s resident. And Townsend breaks back again, and it\u2019s 2-3 against Cirstea. This game is topsy turvy, to say the least. Mertens is 4-2 up now. Meanwhile, we await the arrival of Wozniacki and her match in the Arthur Ashe court with Andreescu. Townsend breaks back but faces a real problem in trying to hold her serve in the next, being taken to deuce and requiring a fierce winner to save a break point. Then comes another winner from Cirstea and the need to save another break point. Then comes another, which is finally claimed. It\u2019s 3-1 to the Romanian. Mertens has another break and is 3-1 up on Petkovic. Some early breaks. Townsend has been broken early and it\u2019s 2-0 to Cirstea, while Mertens has taken a 2-0 lead on Petkovic. It\u2019s pretty quiet down at the Flushing Meadows. It is Saturday morning, after all, but the knocking up has begun on the courts. Rafa Nadal is out on the practice courts, his face the usual picture of concentration. Today, though is all about one clash. First on the Grandstand court will be Elise Mertens and Andrea Petkovic, a clash of Belgium v Germany. And on the Louis Armstrong court will be the American Taylor Townsend and the Romanian Sorana Cirstea. It\u2019s a day heavy on the doubles action, and Jamie Murray is in action with fellow Brit Neal Skupski against Juan Ignacio Londero and Ricardas Berankis, an alliance of Argentina and Lithuania. And Konta is keeping the British end up. All Australian eyes are on Ashleigh Barty. Cue Roger... Before the action begins at 4pm UK time, a glance at today\u2019s stories. Back to Queens we go - the New York one, not that posh place by Baron\u2019s Court - and what looks to be a pretty low-key middle Saturday until we reach the prime time meeting of Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka, the plum third-round match in either of the singles. Before that, Rafa Nadal will be expected to make serene progress past Chung Hyeon, the Korean ranked number 141 in the world in uncharted territory at the US Open. There\u2019s also Caroline Wozniacki, losing finalist in 2009 and 2014, and who will be playing a dangerous opponent in Canada\u2019s Bianca Andreescu, just 19, and who has also not reached as far as this. Here is a full order of play from the official site.",

      "bodyText": "In a world of misinformation, spin and lies, good journalism is more vital than ever, and this week revealed just how important it remains for journalists to look past the spin and let the facts and data lead the way. This week, my colleague Paul Karp broke a rather stunning story that when the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the two-year survey of household incomes and wealth in July it had changed references to wealth inequality in its media release in order to craft a \u201cgood media story\u201d. In effect the ABS media releases sought to downplay the reality of growing inequality. Such a move saw it ignore the data in its own release and instead push an angle that was more in keeping with the government\u2019s political agenda. The government has long been seeking to downplay the issue of inequality. This week the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told the Sydney Institute that \u201cLabor in more recent years explicitly committed itself to the flawed socialist pursuit of equality of outcomes \u2013 falsely asserting that Australia had a major and growing inequality problem\u201d. Except, as the ABS survey showed, this is not a false assertion at all. And yet despite the survey data showing there had been an increase in inequality, the headline of the media release was \u201cInequality stable since 2013\u201314\u201d. The media release did note that \u201cthe data published today also showed there was a marginal increase in wealth inequality in 2017\u201318 and that wealth continues to be less equally distributed between households than income amongst Australians\u201d. Basically the ABS was unable to keep to the spin throughout its own media release. Unlike other government departments the ABS is actually independent \u2013 it needs to be to ensure the public believes the data is not being tainted by political hands. There is no evidence at all this has occurred, and yet this smoothing of the message in the media release is not something that does the ABS any credit. The faith in institutions is under attack from all quarters \u2013 those institutions should not be giving their critics free kicks. But the story also highlighted the importance of good journalism. This survey was unusual in that, as it was a special release with a massive amount of data and nothing that can actually affect markets (given the figures relate to a survey from over a year ago), some journalists (including myself) were given an embargoed copy. This gave us time to write up stories that would give readers a good sense of what was contained in the data. I must admit when the stories went up as soon as the embargo was lifted I was slightly surprised to see a few media outlets suggest that we are now apparently a nation of millionaires. I had a bit of a cold chill run down my spine as I worried I had missed an obvious point, because at no stage when I was going through all the spreadsheets did a figure like that jump out at me. And then I realised why this was the lead \u2013 the ABS had also put out another media release \u2013 with its own headline: \u201cAverage household wealth tops $1 million\u201d. So I guess it was not surprising that the Australian reported that \u201cAustralia a nation of millionaires for the first time in history\u201d, or the AFR went with \u201cAussie householders are millionaires, on average\u201d. The West Australian ran with \u201cAustralian household wealth cracks $1m mark for first time\u201d, stating that \u201cyou certainly might not feel like one, you may not even think you know one and you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible among all the economic doom and gloom, but the statistics don\u2019t lie \u2013 for the first time, Australia is a nation of millionaires\u201d.

The same table that showed the $1m average household wealth figure also showed that only the top 30% of households held this level of wealth, and the median household wealth was $558,900. Now I might not be the greatest statistician in the world, but I don\u2019t think 30% of households equals \u201ca nation\u201d. Instead my own report opened with this: \u201cThe latest two-year survey of household incomes and wealth from the Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed that over the past two years inequality has increased.

In my opinion we actually have some excellent economics reporters in this country. We are a bit of a nerdy club \u2013 those few people in press rooms who like numbers and even know how to find our way around an Excel spreadsheet. The household income and wealth report saw the best journalists rise to the occasion. The ABC\u2019s Michael Janda and Stephen Long and Nine\u2019s Shane Wright and Eryk Bagshaw saw through the spin and reported on the growing level of inequality. I like to think my own work was also good, (I certainly had more graphs than anyone else!) But the whole affair highlights the importance of good journalism at a time when the plethora of news and noise can lead to an easy regurgitation of media releases and a comment from officials or ministers who merely confirm what they want you to think and report. For me the data and the facts are always the story, and the news this week only confirms that you should put your trust in journalists and media organisations who think the same. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "News organisations have been slow to respond to the tide of legislation that progressively and surely threatens their ability to report the affairs of state. Indeed, some media outlets have a history of cheering on the rampant growth of national security laws, as though the mantra of government was more important than their ability to unearth the truth. There was an eerie sense of a police state when images emerged of the Australian federal police entering the ABC in Sydney and demanding access to the corporation\u2019s files on sensitive news reports. Only days earlier the police had been rifling through the Canberra home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst. It prompted a heightened concern about the cankered state in which the \u201cfree press\u201d finds itself. Calls for a special independent inquiry into how security laws impinge on a free press were headed off by the government to the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. The reporting date is 17 October. The inquiry could well overlap with work under way by the Senate environment and communications references committee looking into \u201cthe adequacy of commonwealth laws and frameworks covering the disclosure and reporting of sensitive and classified information\u201d. The most significant laws that have an adverse impact on journalism and how it functions can be divided into those that block access to information; those that criminalise dealing with and publishing information about the state; and those that enable the state to track and monitor the work of journalists. What we find is a maze of enactments, dizzying in their complexity and uncertainty. The definition of national security is unsettled, the defences few and in most instances worthless, while the penalties for transgression are severe. To better understand the enormity of what is at stake it is important to drill into these laws and identify the pitfalls facing a \u201cfree press\u201d, which in an ideal world is supposed to be as vital a component of a liberal democracy as parliamentary elections, an independent judiciary and a professional public service. Stuff that is off limits to the media Where, in a criminal or civil trial, issues arise relating to national security information, the National Security information (Criminal And Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 asks the courts to go into cloak and dagger mode. The government can address the court about how it should deal with any national security information before it. This hearing itself must be in camera and, after the parties are heard, the court may make an order to hear the case in closed session and it only need publish its reasons to the parties and the attorney general. Witnesses can be compelled to silence or excluded from proceedings and evidence suppressed. Reporting these cases is an impossibility. All offences under the act carry two-year jail terms. We\u2019re seeing an example of this suppression and secrecy playing out now in the commonwealth\u2019s case against Bernard Collaery, a Canberra lawyer accused of leaking information about the Australian\u2019s government clandestine and illegal bugging of the Timor-Leste ministerial offices. The government wants Collaery\u2019s trial held behind closed doors on grounds of \u201cnational security\u201d. The Asio Act also makes it illegal to disclose information about secret Asio business, or \u201cspecial intelligence operations\u201d (SIOs). This extends to Asio engaging in illegal activities or intimidation. It is not always clear to a journalist whether Asio has classified an operation as \u201cspecial\u201d, so reporting on something without knowing its ramifications poses a high risk. To make things ever riskier, defendants are required to disprove their guilt. Much of the national security regime illustrates a pleonastic overkill, whereby the same offences are punishable under separate pieces of legislation. An offence under the \u201cspecial intelligence operation\u201d provision of the Asio Act might just as conceivably be an offence under the more recent provisions of the criminal code dealing with \u201csecret information\u201d. The prosecutors might be able to have two bites of the cherry for reporters who delve into the affairs of the secret intelligence organisation. Danger zones for reporters In the middle of last year the criminal code part 5.6 created new crimes for government insiders, eg whistleblowers, who reveal things the regime regards as secret. It also criminalises journalists, who publish things insiders have told them. The legislative enterprise was to clamp down hard on leaking from inside the tent to those outside. It is a direct assault on public interest journalism, which is heavily dependant on secret sources for stories about the manner in which political power is exercised or abused. There is a broad palette of information that potentially attracts criminal sanctions. Penalties range from two to seven years\u2019 imprisonment for basic offences, or up to 10 years for aggravated offences. We have seen stories suppressed on application by the government where court cases involve foreign political leaders. The Securency bribery case was one such, where reporting had earlier been subject to a super injunction because the government wanted to prevent diplomatic embarrassment. Journalists and others, such as human rights organisations and bloggers, can fall foul of provisions that apply where information is obtained from a commonwealth employee or former employee. Only classified or top secret information is relevant in these circumstances, or information which, if communicated, would endanger Australian security, harm public health and safety, or interfere with preventing, investigating or prosecuting a federal crime. The penalty for publishing is five years and two years for \u201cdealing\u201d with secret information. Even for journalists to receive a letter containing classified information, without the contents being known before the envelope is opened, may be sufficient to form the basis of a case against the news gatherers. There\u2019s a defence for those engaged in the business of news media who believed publishing or dealing with the information was in the public interest. A judge\u2019s view of what is in the public interest is often at variance with those media defendants. The defence applies not just to journalists, but to editorial support staff working under their direction. It does not, however, apply to whistleblowers, and apparently not to independent citizen journalists or others, such as human rights activists, who are not in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of news. There are other, narrower defences, like prior publication, or reporting maladministration to a relevant investigatory body. Espionage In Australia, you can be a spy by strict liability. And you can get up to 20 years\u2019 jail for your troubles. That\u2019s the effect of amendments to the criminal code in relation to espionage passed in June last year. They were introduced by the attorney general, Christian Porter, as part of a suite of espionage-busting, foreign-influence fighting, national security-fetishising reforms. The new laws criminalise making information available to \u201cforeign principals\u201d, meaning foreign governments, political parties, terrorist groups and international organisations. The offences range over information related to national security \u2013 or indeed any information or classified information \u2013 that has been dealt with so that it ends up in the hands of a \u201cforeign principal\u201d and harms Australia\u2019s security. The penalties range from life in prison to 20 years. For journalists there are dangers lurking not far from the surface. The United Nations, or an agency of the United Nations, or Al Jazeera, which is controlled by a foreign power, could all conceivably be in receipt of information from a journalist as part of the process of research and gathering news. As we have seen in the cases of Witness K and Collaery, a broad view is taken by prosecutors as to what constitutes harm to Australia\u2019s security. A finding of guilt is not dependant on national security actually being harmed and the potential offender does not need to have a specific foreign principal in mind. The only defence for a media defendant is prior publication \u2013 that someone else had already published the information and that there was a reasonable belief that republication would not harm Australian security. Slim pickings indeed. Snooping on journalists There are a number of quite recent measures that enhance the power of the state to monitor the work of journalists and media organisations \u2013 the metadata provisions and the anti-encryption provisions among them. Under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Act 2015, a Brandis-era enactment from 2015, telcos are required to hang on to citizens\u2019 metadata for two years after its creation. Security agencies, including the AFP, Asio and state police, can access this data for law enforcement purposes. The list of accessing agencies is long and disturbing. The fourth estate gets a fig leaf\u2019s worth of protection: where the object of accessing journalists\u2019 metadata is to identify sources the enforcement agency must apply for a special warrant. Asio can read anyone\u2019s metadata, so long as it is relevant to the agency\u2019s functions, while other security organisations can do so for three reasons: to enforce the criminal law, to locate missing persons, or to enforce a law with a pecuniary penalty. There\u2019s plenty of journalism that would be covered by those categories \u2013 stories about missing children; corporate fraud; abuses in the provision of human services, such as health and education; political and/or administrative mismanagement; corruption; and domestic violence \u2013 in fact, all the important stories and a large proportion of the content of the daily media. The warrants are warrants in name only and the alleged protection for journalists and their sources is non-existent with the process routinely abused. The Commonwealth Ombudsman recently revealed that a journalist\u2019s data had been illegally obtained in Western Australia and in the ACT it emerged that between March 11 and October 2015 the ACT police unlawfully accessed citizens\u2019 metadata 3,365 times. Citizen journalists, casual commentators and human rights organisations are not afforded the screen of these faux-warrants. Once issued, warrants remain secret and disclosing their existence is a crime punishable with two years\u2019 jail. Applications can be heard by a range of officials, depending on the situation: federal magistrates, administrative appeals tribunal members, even the attorney general himself. The relevant authority must be satisfied the warrant is in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d. Recently, it was revealed that 78% of interception warrants under other provisions in the TIA Act were signed off, not by judges, but by members of the AAT, the most rampantly stacked federal quasi-judicial body. In a flurry of pre-election fear-mongering, parliament late last year also passed the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act, another range of measures that directly assaults the journalistic process, which frequently uses encrypted communications to protect sources. The legislation requires telcos to help Australian security agencies hack into users\u2019 encrypted data. It also extended covert search warrants under a string of commonwealth acts, whereby the constabulary can lawfully snoop on blissfully unaware subjects. The AFP, Asio, the ASD and state police can either request or force telcos to hack their customers. The laws only apply where the relevant agencies are investigating a crime punishable by three or more years\u2019 jail, ie an enormous number of crimes. The installation of malware on to suspects\u2019 devices, or removing encryption, is also a possible byproduct of the legislation. Police can apply for a \u201ccovert computer access\u201d warrant. If granted, this warrant never has to be served, and agencies can hack a computer without anyone knowing. This legislation has the potential to take the state deeper into the newsrooms of the nation, to vet or thwart journalism. Finally \u2026 We could go on with other recent developments. For instance, the Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Act, 2019, applies if media organisations \u201chost\u201d on their websites \u201cviolent, abhorrent material\u201d. In practice this could include audio or images of terrorist attacks, although journalists may have a rather vague \u201cpublic interest\u201d defence. If the defence fails, the penalties are steep: for natural persons it\u2019s three years\u2019 prison or $2.1m, or both, and, for a corporation, it\u2019s a fine of $10.5m or 10% of turnover, whichever is greater. Turnover includes global takings. The legislation joins the ranks of those measures whose effect is to chill journalists and their sources. There is a vast and untidy array of laws to enforce state secrecy and security. They hang over the heads of news rooms with uncertainty as to whether a particular law applies, what limited defences are available and whether toothbrushes should be at the ready. In the process of creating a hyperventilating regime of secrecy and security, the state has put a hobnailed boot on the throat of journalism. News publishers find it less risky, and maybe more profitable, if stories about abuse of power are shunted in favour of how to cook a mushroom omelette. \u2022 Richard Ackland publishes the law journals Justinian and Gazette of Law and Journalism.

But as the number of offenders placed on electronic monitoring devices grows, there is still no consensus on whether they work.

Many areas of Australia, including Brisbane, Hobart, and parts of Western Australia are currently facing severe rainfall deficiencies, according to Bureau of Meteorology. For the southern half of Australia, the period from January to July 2019 is the driest start to the year on record.</p> <p>Andrew Harris, from the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Sydney, studies how we use water and how we could be capturing and storing it better. He thinks potable water should only be used to drinking, and that we should find a way to reuse everything else.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia is a big, geographically diverse, hot, dry country so water will always be a challenge for us,\u201d he says. \u201cIt tends to go in large cycles; we\u2019ll have periods of wet ... the dams fill up and everybody forgets we\u2019ve got a problem. Then it runs out, like we\u2019re seeing at the moment. The main uses of water in Australia are not domestic \u2013 it\u2019s agriculture and commercial. But the most significant impact water authorities, like Sydney Water, have is behavioural programs with their customers.\u201d </p> <p>Since Sydney\u2019s last drought, it\u2019s become common to see <a href=\"https://www.choice.com.au/home-improvement/water/saving-water/articles/guide-to-greywater-systems\">greywater systems</a> incorporated into new home developments. While retrofitting these sorts of systems comes with considerable costs, reusing greywater doesn\u2019t need to be expensive.</p> <p>The good news? Most water-saving changes require <em>less </em>effort than your usual routine.</p> <h2><strong>Collect water from your shower \u2013 and keep it to three minutes</strong></h2> <p>If you can\u2019t afford to implement a greywater and water treatment system in your home (<a href=\"https://www.choice.com.au/home-improvement/water/saving-water/articles/guide-to-greywater-systems\">Choice</a> place costs from $3,000-$10,000), Harris suggests collecting water with a bucket or tub. \u201cUsing a bucket in the shower, or putting a tank underneath the downpipe when it rains, those are things anybody can and should be doing.</p> <p>\u201cTake shorter showers \u2013 you really shouldn\u2019t be there for more than three minutes. Look at the behaviour in Cape Town recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/04/back-from-the-brink-how-cape-town-cracked-its-water-crisis\">they were pretty convinced that their dam was going to run dry and the city going to be without water</a>. People stopped taking showers altogether, and they washed with buckets.\u201d These measures aren\u2019t out of the question for Australians, either. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had to do that in Australia in the capital cities, but there are some expectations in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/24/nsw-towns-including-dubbo-and-tamworth-face-water-emergency-within-months\">country New South Wales</a> for example \u2013 Coonabarabran, Dubbo \u2013 where they are going to run out of water very shortly, and it\u2019ll have to be trucked in for drinking only.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Stop hand-washing your dishes</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c8fb0f6bb2e97fec6e863bbb124a396afa7ba6e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8fb0f6bb2e97fec6e863bbb124a396afa7ba6e3/0_138_4144_2487/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley Iredale says using a dishwasher is simply better than washing by hand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashley Iredale says using a dishwasher is better than washing by hand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Choice content producer for white goods Ashley Iredale says using a dishwasher is simply better than washing by hand. He says, \u201cA <a href=\"https://www.landtechnik.uni-bonn.de/forschung/haushaltstechnik/publikationen/eedal-manualdishwashing-ht1\">University of Bonn study</a> found that hand-washing the equivalent items of a full dishwasher used, on average, 100 litres of water compared to 12 litres of water in a dishwasher.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the new dishwashers have technology to retain the final rinse water, to use in the first rinse of the next cycle.\u201d A full dishwasher will actually dry dishes better, as well. \u201cThey dry by building up a heat load in the crockery, and letting the moisture evaporate, so with a full dishwasher you\u2019ve got more of a thermal mass and it will improve your drying performance.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wash your clothes less often</strong></h2> <p>Tullia Jack, sociologist at Lund University in Sweden, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-dirt-on-clothes-why-washing-less-is-more-sustainable-11531\">has written about our obsession with cleanliness for years</a>. Her research questions why we feel the need to wash as often as we do.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of us wash more than we need to, many of us out of habit,\u201d she says. \u201cAn easy way to reduce water and energy consumption is to simply wash less. At first it can seem strange to hang your jeans up, rather than throw them into the laundry basket. If you air out clothes that aren\u2019t dirty they can go back into the wardrobe \u2013 [saving] not only water and energy, but also time. The main barrier is getting into the habit.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Or don\u2019t wash at all</strong></h2> <p>\u201cNot showering saves water, energy, chemicals and not least time,\u201d Jack says. \u201cYou can contribute to sustainability by doing less \u2013 you don\u2019t have to actively <em>do</em> something to save water. Clean less, launder less, shower less. We are more worried about what other people might think about us ... [than] if we actually smell or not.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Fill your washing machine \u2013 and make sure it\u2019s a front loader</strong></h2> <p>Iredale\u2019s research at Choice found that regardless of the capacity of the washing machine, most people are only washing around 3.5kg of clothing per load. \u201cDo one full run as opposed to two half-full runs. It\u2019s not going to halve your water consumption, but it\u2019s going to reduce it a lot \u2013 and you\u2019ll save money on detergent.\u201d If you\u2019re looking to upgrade your washing machine, choose a front-loader. \u201cTop-loading washing machines need enough water so that your clothes float and move around; front loaders work by picking up your clothes and dropping them back into the wash water.\u201d A top-loader can use over 100 litres of water compared to 60 litres for the equivalent capacity in a front-loader washing machine.</p> <h2><strong>Use greywater to feed your plants</strong></h2> <p>The founder of sustainability-driven design practice <a href=\"http://mundanematters.co/\">Mundane Matters</a>, Danling Xiao, says: \u201cIt\u2019s very important to be aware of the collective effort. I soak and eat legumes almost every day, so the water for soaking often goes into the backyard.

      "bodyText": "Despite a week of rainy days, from Sunday residents in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and Illawarra will be fined $220 for turning on their sprinklers, watering their gardens between 10am and 4pm or leaving their hoses running unattended. For businesses, that fine goes up to $550. While the Sydney region has been under water restrictions since late May, fines for non-compliance will be issued on 1 September onward. In Australia, the average household uses 900 litres of drinking water every day \u2013 close to three times the 321-litre daily usage of households in drought-stricken California. When Cape Town\u2019s dam levels ran perilously low in 2018, the city was placed on a 50 litre per-person per-day water ration. On 22 August, Sydney\u2019s dam water levels dropped below 50% for the first time since 2004 and on 29 August verified water storage levels were still below 50%. If water levels fall below 40%, as a dry weather outlook for spring suggests they may, the city could experience stage two water restrictions for the first time in 15 years. Drought is an issue across the continent. Many areas of Australia, including Brisbane, Hobart, and parts of Western Australia are currently facing severe rainfall deficiencies, according to Bureau of Meteorology. For the southern half of Australia, the period from January to July 2019 is the driest start to the year on record. Andrew Harris, from the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Sydney, studies how we use water and how we could be capturing and storing it better. He thinks potable water should only be used to drinking, and that we should find a way to reuse everything else. \u201cAustralia is a big, geographically diverse, hot, dry country so water will always be a challenge for us,\u201d he says. \u201cIt tends to go in large cycles; we\u2019ll have periods of wet ... the dams fill up and everybody forgets we\u2019ve got a problem. Then it runs out, like we\u2019re seeing at the moment. The main uses of water in Australia are not domestic \u2013 it\u2019s agriculture and commercial. But the most significant impact water authorities, like Sydney Water, have is behavioural programs with their customers.\u201d Since Sydney\u2019s last drought, it\u2019s become common to see greywater systems incorporated into new home developments. While retrofitting these sorts of systems comes with considerable costs, reusing greywater doesn\u2019t need to be expensive. The good news? Most water-saving changes require less effort than your usual routine. Collect water from your shower \u2013 and keep it to three minutes If you can\u2019t afford to implement a greywater and water treatment system in your home (Choice place costs from $3,000-$10,000), Harris suggests collecting water with a bucket or tub. \u201cUsing a bucket in the shower, or putting a tank underneath the downpipe when it rains, those are things anybody can and should be doing. \u201cTake shorter showers \u2013 you really shouldn\u2019t be there for more than three minutes. Look at the behaviour in Cape Town recently, they were pretty convinced that their dam was going to run dry and the city going to be without water. People stopped taking showers altogether, and they washed with buckets.\u201d These measures aren\u2019t out of the question for Australians, either. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had to do that in Australia in the capital cities, but there are some expectations in country New South Wales for example \u2013 Coonabarabran, Dubbo \u2013 where they are going to run out of water very shortly, and it\u2019ll have to be trucked in for drinking only.\u201d Stop hand-washing your dishes Choice content producer for white goods Ashley Iredale says using a dishwasher is simply better than washing by hand. He says, \u201cA University of Bonn study found that hand-washing the equivalent items of a full dishwasher used, on average, 100 litres of water compared to 12 litres of water in a dishwasher. \u201cSome of the new dishwashers have technology to retain the final rinse water, to use in the first rinse of the next cycle.\u201d A full dishwasher will actually dry dishes better, as well. \u201cThey dry by building up a heat load in the crockery, and letting the moisture evaporate, so with a full dishwasher you\u2019ve got more of a thermal mass and it will improve your drying performance.\u201d Wash your clothes less often Tullia Jack, sociologist at Lund University in Sweden, has written about our obsession with cleanliness for years. Her research questions why we feel the need to wash as often as we do. \u201cI think a lot of us wash more than we need to, many of us out of habit,\u201d she says. \u201cAn easy way to reduce water and energy consumption is to simply wash less. At first it can seem strange to hang your jeans up, rather than throw them into the laundry basket. If you air out clothes that aren\u2019t dirty they can go back into the wardrobe \u2013 [saving] not only water and energy, but also time. The main barrier is getting into the habit.\u201d Or don\u2019t wash at all \u201cNot showering saves water, energy, chemicals and not least time,\u201d Jack says. \u201cYou can contribute to sustainability by doing less \u2013 you don\u2019t have to actively do something to save water. Clean less, launder less, shower less. We are more worried about what other people might think about us ... [than] if we actually smell or not.\u201d Fill your washing machine \u2013 and make sure it\u2019s a front loader Iredale\u2019s research at Choice found that regardless of the capacity of the washing machine, most people are only washing around 3.5kg of clothing per load. \u201cDo one full run as opposed to two half-full runs. It\u2019s not going to halve your water consumption, but it\u2019s going to reduce it a lot \u2013 and you\u2019ll save money on detergent.\u201d If you\u2019re looking to upgrade your washing machine, choose a front-loader. \u201cTop-loading washing machines need enough water so that your clothes float and move around; front loaders work by picking up your clothes and dropping them back into the wash water.\u201d A top-loader can use over 100 litres of water compared to 60 litres for the equivalent capacity in a front-loader washing machine. Use greywater to feed your plants The founder of sustainability-driven design practice Mundane Matters, Danling Xiao, says: \u201cIt\u2019s very important to be aware of the collective effort. I soak and eat legumes almost every day, so the water for soaking often goes into the backyard. I\u2019ve started to collect cold water from the shower to water the plants.\u201d If you already have a condenser dryer or heat-pump dryer in your laundry closet, chances are you\u2019re already collecting greywater. Iredale from Choice explains: \u201cThey condense the moisture and the dryer collects it in a tank, so you can then use that water for watering plants. You\u2019ll get up to about four litres out of a large load of clothes.\u201d Another way to keep your garden hydrated is to invest in mulch to help protect the soil from the sun, retaining water. Water storage crystals also work to limit water waste, absorbing water to slow-release back into the soil \u2013 increasing the time needed between waterings. Write to your water provider Harris urges customers to contact their suppliers. \u201cSydney loses about 8% of its total water consumption through losses in the piping network.\u201d Consumers should demand that utilities keep their network up to date and well maintained. \u201cBecause that\u2019s a serious amount of water.\u201d \u201cAustralia will always have droughts and they\u2019re going to get worse.

And while it\u2019s true the media give the issue more time and attention, the reporting of incidents where mental illness is involved in a crime needs to improve.</p> <p>\u201cThe current approach creates the impression that anyone with an illness is potentially violent. There needs to be more context, which invariably reveals that the perpetrator has not been treated.</p> <p>\u201cGovernment needs to make it a high priority not just in health but across portfolios including housing, justice, emergency services and the NDIS. I see a parallel with aged care, but my worry is that mental health is even lower down the pile. We need more MPs to understand how devastating it is for families.

It\u2019s a very scaleable model.\u201d</p> <p>One gets the impression that remaining busy is imperative for Fels, not because he fears relevance deprivation syndrome, as Keating\u2019s remark implied, but because of the moral compass he has spent a lifetime living by. Even on holiday his reading material of choice has a somewhat worthy quality to it: \u201cI\u2019m still pursuing self-improvement.\u201d</p> <p><em>Tough Customer by Allan Fels (MUP) is published on 2 September</em></p>",

And besides, regulators can be as powerful as MPs.\u201d Today there is no party he would consider membership of, he says, but his faith has remained a constant source of comfort and guidance: \u201cAnd my own parish in South Yarra has had a very strong social commitment to mental health and refugee housing.\u201d Although he is encouraged that attitudes to mental health have shifted, if he had to write a report card on Australia\u2019s approach his assessment would be \u201ccould do better\u201d. \u201cAs far as as the public goes, there\u2019s been a vast improvement in sympathy for mild mental health issues such as depression, but not for more severe conditions. And while it\u2019s true the media give the issue more time and attention, the reporting of incidents where mental illness is involved in a crime needs to improve. \u201cThe current approach creates the impression that anyone with an illness is potentially violent. There needs to be more context, which invariably reveals that the perpetrator has not been treated. \u201cGovernment needs to make it a high priority not just in health but across portfolios including housing, justice, emergency services and the NDIS. I see a parallel with aged care, but my worry is that mental health is even lower down the pile. We need more MPs to understand how devastating it is for families. Politicians think there are not many votes in it. And the trouble is that the mental health lobby is not very effective. They are quite divided by competing interests, and fighting over crumbs.\u201d As well as being a director of MIND, the organisation that provides psychosocial services to support mental health, he will continue to champion the rollout of the Haven Foundation\u2019s residential model nationally: \u201cThere are currently two in Victoria and we have secured funding for another seven. It\u2019s a very scaleable model.\u201d One gets the impression that remaining busy is imperative for Fels, not because he fears relevance deprivation syndrome, as Keating\u2019s remark implied, but because of the moral compass he has spent a lifetime living by. Even on holiday his reading material of choice has a somewhat worthy quality to it: \u201cI\u2019m still pursuing self-improvement.\u201d Tough Customer by Allan Fels (MUP) is published on 2 September",

Their institutional memories appear to have gone with them. \u201cThose that were alive and politically active, among the 400 ordinary people who were arrested in one afternoon, many of them are dead or so old they no longer take part in the political process,\u201d O\u2019Gorman says. \u201cWhen you forget history or conveniently airbrush it out, then you\u2019re destined to repeat history.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Melbourne doctor Ann Drillich, the daughter of Polish Holocaust survivors, is a rare kind of Jew who owns a Catholic church. The brick structure, Our Lady of the Scapular, stands on Drillich\u2019s ancestral property in the medieval town of Tarn\u00f3w, near Krak\u00f3w. Her late mother, Blanka Drillich n\u00e9e Goldman, inherited the land at the end of the second world war. Aged 18, Blanka was the sole living heir to the Goldman estate, all others perished in the town\u2019s ghetto: she found her mother shot dead in her bed.</p> <p>But Drillich has never been inside her church.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to enter it once,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was locked.\u201d</p> <p>The reason: in 1987, with the help of a trusted friend of the Drillichs, the Catholic church in Poland effectively stole the land and built the house of worship on the site. The Drillichs didn\u2019t know. Ann Drillich only learned of the theft in 2010 when, as heir, she ordered a public records search about her family\u2019s estate.</p> <p>\u201cAt first it took a while to settle in, the shock of the betrayal,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the idea that behind the injustice is a <em>church</em>.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s family was one of the most prominent in town. It was like they had stolen not just our land, but my family\u2019s history.\u201d</p> <p>And so after the shock settled, she sued.</p> <p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>So began an expensive, traumatic and escalating battle that pitched this meticulous woman with a scientific sensibility against a powerful religious institution.</p> <p>The church appealed. Stalled. Obstructed. Counter-sued. The Polish courts, meanwhile, delivered justice to Drillich, again and again. And yet again, in a final ruling in 2016 when three district court judges found the church had acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d when it acquired the \u201cabandoned\u201d land.</p> <p>That should have been where the story ends, with Drillich, a lecturer to medical students, finally clearing the fortress of legal documents from the suburban home she shares with her family and two needy miniature schnauzers. Getting closure on a draining saga that\u2019s stirred up traumatic memories from a childhood blighted by the legacy of the second world war.</p> <p>But in Poland, closure, whether legal or historical, is hard to come by, and now, on the eve of the 80th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Poland, Drillich is facing an extraordinary legal challenge in a case that testifies to the nation\u2019s populist zeitgeist under the ironically-named Law and Justice party, and its fraught relationship with the past.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The Goldmans\u2019 roots in Tarn\u00f3w stretched back centuries. Before the war, their sprawling estate in Gumniska Street boasted a tile factory, extensive gardens and a neo-Gothic villa. While the latter, taken by the state in 1985, now houses a public registry and is officially named \u201cthe Wedding Palace\u201d, the building is still known colloquially as \u201cGoldmanowka\u201d, Goldman House, after its former owners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c9a12f2154cda34b635d119bfb0a381034233aca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a12f2154cda34b635d119bfb0a381034233aca/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photographs of Ann Drillich\u2019s mother\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographs of Ann Drillich\u2019s mother Blanka Drillich nee Goldman, and her great grandfather Izak Goldman (back image) who left the estate to Blanka after the second world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1941, the Nazis forced Blanka Goldman, her grandfather, aunt and parents into the ghetto. Within months all were murdered, except Blanka. Blanka told of \u201cPolish thugs\u201d rampaging through laneways, leading Nazis to Jews.</p> <p>But many Poles resisted the Nazis and saved Jews. Among them, the Drillichs\u2019 friends, the Poetschkes. Catholics with German roots, the Poetschkes had been renting part of the Goldman estate. Their son Jerzy was especially fond of Dr Drillich\u2019s fair-haired mother Blanka, whose beauty had the advantage of not appearing Semitic. Blanka escaped the ghetto. For the rest of the war the Poetschkes hid her in the basement and attic of Goldman house while they lived upstairs.</p> <p>It was a poignant display of bravery: had the Nazis discovered the Poetschkes\u2019 subterfuge they would surely have been executed. In the 1990s, thanks to Drillich\u2019s family, Jerzy was honoured as a \u201cRighteous Pole\u201d, a gentile who risked his life to save Jews. His name is listed on the honour roll at Warsaw\u2019s POLIN: Museum of the History of Polish Jews.</p> <p>Yet in the complex duality of Polish-Jewish relations, Jerzy\u2019s saving Blanka\u2019s life did not stop him conspiring with the church to steal her family\u2019s property.</p> <p>\u201cMy father said Jerzy\u2019s betrayal was one of the biggest disappointments of his life,\u201d Drillich says.</p> <p>Tarn\u00f3w\u2019s 25,000 Jews accounted for almost half the town\u2019s pre-war population. After liberation only about 700 returned \u2013 and according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum virtually all of them soon left after encountering lingering antisemitism. Such was the case with Blanka. Three years after inheriting her estate, she left Poland, married Henryk Drillich, also a survivor from Tarn\u00f3w and later settled in Australia. She left the Poetschkes to administer the estate under her power of attorney.</p> <p>In following decades, the communist authorities confiscated much of the land.</p> <p>The more painful travesty was to come.</p> <p>In 1986 the Diocese Curia in Tarn\u00f3w, through Bishop Piotr Bednarczyk, wrote to Henryk offering to buy the estate of Blanka, by then deceased. The parties haggled over terms without striking a final agreement. Yet that same October, on the advice of parish lawyers, Jerzy successfully applied to Tarn\u00f3w\u2019s regional court to gain ownership of the \u201cabandoned\u201d land through adverse possession.</p> <p>Asked for the address of Blanka Goldman, he testified \u201cunknown\u201d. He\u2019d sent a condolence card on her death 13 years earlier.</p> <p>He donated half the 8,500 square metres to the church, sold the other half and pocketed the money. It was only in the 1990s that he resumed contact with the Drillichs. When in 1993 Henryk visited Tarn\u00f3w for the first time since the war, Jerzy showed him round the old estate. He said nothing about the plots that went to the church. He has since died.</p> <p>***</p> <p>After what seemed like the final legal victory for Drillich in 2016, the church concocted new proceedings about these already-adjudicated matters and dialled up the tone. In November 2017, the parish wrote to the district prosecutor\u2019s office in Tarn\u00f3w alleging \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that Drillich, her notaries and lawyers had used \u201cforged\u201d documents to \u201cunlawfully swindle compensation from the church\u201d.</p> <p>Says Drillich\u2019s lawyer, Tomasz Krawczyk: \u201cIt\u2019s really the most outrageous legal obstruction I\u2019ve seen in my 15-year legal career. And the whole time they were working on the minister of justice to bring the appeal.\u201d</p> <p>In May, minister Zbigniew Ziobro \u2013 also, conveniently, the prosecutor general \u2013 enlisted in the church\u2019s crusade by petitioning the politically dependable supreme court judges in the Orwellian-sounding Chamber of Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs to overturn the earlier rulings in Drillich\u2019s favour. Under controversial 2017 reforms the prosecutor general can bring an \u201cextraordinary appeal\u201d to annul virtually any court ruling over the past 20 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c4179a2c9a872c463c266c6026f108a4e7a7e4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c4179a2c9a872c463c266c6026f108a4e7a7e4f/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ann Drillich\u2019s, who is in a legal battle in Poland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ann Drillich\u2019s documents, who is in a legal battle in Poland over her inherited family estate, papers and research material including images of the church in question (bottom right) and the \u2018wedding house\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, said the remedy \u201callows the natural legal order to be restored in accordance with the principle of social justice\u201d. The European Union sees judicial independence undermined.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you have to ask is why on earth would a relatively inconsequential case in a provincial town like this one be so important for the Polish government?\u201d says Wojciech Sadurski, a law professor at the Universities of Sydney and Warsaw, and author of Poland\u2019s Constitutional Breakdown. He notes the minister\u2019s grounds for bringing the appeal relate to narrow questions of law, \u201ctoo trivial and technical, it seems to me, to qualify as a matter of \u2018social justice\u2019. So the answer is the case is important for the church \u00ba and the politicians need the support of the church to stay in power. I think it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p> <p>Sadurski can himself testify to the prevailing enthusiasm for politically motivated law suits; he\u2019s fighting a criminal case and two civil suits for defamation for tweets critical of the ruling party and neutered public broadcaster. To be fair, his is a non-exclusive club. Free speech is a fragile thing in contemporary Poland. And that\u2019s especially true when the talk is about its wartime past. Accusing \u201cthe Polish nation\u201d of complicity in the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities attracts civil penalties \u2013 and that was a backdown from the government under pressure from the US and Israel. The original 2018 law sought to jail offenders.</p> <p>Six million Poles were murdered during the second world war, three million of them Jews \u2013 nearly half of all the Jews killed in the Holocaust. Scholars see in the laws an attempt to whitewash the role of Poles in the Jewish genocide and substitute a nationalist fairytale in which victims cannot also be perpetrators. Ironically, that proposition is most powerfully and unwittingly debunked in the speech \u2013 conspicuously free \u2013 of nationalists themselves. In the same month the justice minister intervened in Drillich\u2019s case, thousands of nativists rallied in Warsaw against a US law requiring that Congress be informed about the progress of countries including Poland on restitution of Jewish assets seized during the second world war and its aftermath.</p> <p>The ruling party, says Holocaust historian Jan Grabowski, of the University of Ottawa in Canada, \u201chas created a wave of fear, paranoia and anger about the so-called Jewish threat\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDrillich\u2019s is a very intriguing and interesting case that can have much larger ramifications than its immediate vicinity. It is part and parcel of a larger campaign to elevate the myth, the fantasy, of national innocence.\u201d</p> <p>By meddling in Drillich\u2019s case, Grabowski says, the government \u201ccan kill several birds with one stone\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20190511-poland-nationalists-protest-usa-holocaust-far-right-anti-semitism\">France 24 reported</a> protestors wearing T-shirts reading \u201cdeath to the enemies of the fatherland\u201d. One man wore a shirt saying, \u201cI will not apologise for Jedwabne\u201d \u2013 a massacre of Jews by their Polish neighbours in 1941 under the German occupation.</p> <p>Polish nationalists argue that Poland, which did not capitulate to the Nazis \u2013 a fact many Holocaust scholars agree should be better known \u2013 has not been adequately compensated by Germany. In short, restitution is a loaded issue; one the government is keen to weaponise.</p> <p>Enter Drillich. Through Drillich\u2019s case, says Grabowski, the Holocaust historian, \u201cthe government wants to prove to the Polish nationalist electorate that the Jews are coming back to claim their properties\u201d.</p> <p>Drillich, meanwhile, pleads her cause near and far. She has lobbied Australian foreign affairs minister Marise Payne (who said the government wouldn\u2019t intervene in a private legal matter) and treasurer Josh Frydenberg, himself a descendent of Holocaust survivors, to take up her case with Polish authorities. Through intermediaries, she has asked senior Catholics in Australia to intervene with their counterparts in Poland. (\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of canon law,\u201d was one perfunctory response.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"434669c74b208d639d2c675c31d69b96944509b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/434669c74b208d639d2c675c31d69b96944509b8/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ann Drillich, who is in a legal battle in Poland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ann Drillich, who is in a legal battle in Poland over her inherited family estate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In July she wrote to the Vatican\u2019s representative in Poland, Archbishop Salvatore Pennacchio: \u201cMy family has been defamed in the Polish media and subjected to antisemitic abuse on social media, which includes tropes such as \u2018blood suckers and non-believers\u2019,\u201d Drillich wrote. \u201cThis year in his denunciation of antisemitism, Pope Francis stated that antisemitism in all its forms is \u2018completely contrary to Christian principles and every vision worthy of the human person\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it mean that faithful parishioners pray on my stolen land and that I receive abuse?\u201d</p> <p>This week she\u2019s pinning her hopes on the extra scrutiny that will fall on Poland as world leaders prepare to descend on Warsaw for the 1 September commemoration.</p> <p>The question of what she\u2019d do if she won her claim seems almost incidental. \u201cIf I won, I\u2019d want an apology, I\u2019d want compensation and genuine reconciliation.

Drillich hesitates only briefly. \u201cThe very night my mother\u2019s grandfather was evicted (from the estate) by the Germans he slept on the balcony. He was 80-something. It was November. You can imagine how freezing it was.\u201d</p> <p>As for Blanka, freedom and a new life in Australia did not bring lasting peace. \u201cMy mother had this real spark. Then she developed depression and I watched her go silent.\u201d</p> <p>In a tragic, distorted echo of what Blanka encountered during the war, when Drillich was 13 she came home from school one day to find her mother had killed herself. \u201cThe Holocaust destroyed my family. I know how much the property meant to my mother. How brave she was to reclaim it after the war.\u201d</p> <p>She returns to the original question. \u201cHow could I not?\u201d</p>",

The brick structure, Our Lady of the Scapular, stands on Drillich\u2019s ancestral property in the medieval town of Tarn\u00f3w, near Krak\u00f3w. Her late mother, Blanka Drillich n\u00e9e Goldman, inherited the land at the end of the second world war.

And yet again, in a final ruling in 2016 when three district court judges found the church had acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d when it acquired the \u201cabandoned\u201d land. That should have been where the story ends, with Drillich, a lecturer to medical students, finally clearing the fortress of legal documents from the suburban home she shares with her family and two needy miniature schnauzers. Getting closure on a draining saga that\u2019s stirred up traumatic memories from a childhood blighted by the legacy of the second world war. But in Poland, closure, whether legal or historical, is hard to come by, and now, on the eve of the 80th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Poland, Drillich is facing an extraordinary legal challenge in a case that testifies to the nation\u2019s populist zeitgeist under the ironically-named Law and Justice party, and its fraught relationship with the past. *** The Goldmans\u2019 roots in Tarn\u00f3w stretched back centuries. Before the war, their sprawling estate in Gumniska Street boasted a tile factory, extensive gardens and a neo-Gothic villa.

And the whole time they were working on the minister of justice to bring the appeal.\u201d In May, minister Zbigniew Ziobro \u2013 also, conveniently, the prosecutor general \u2013 enlisted in the church\u2019s crusade by petitioning the politically dependable supreme court judges in the Orwellian-sounding Chamber of Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs to overturn the earlier rulings in Drillich\u2019s favour. Under controversial 2017 reforms the prosecutor general can bring an \u201cextraordinary appeal\u201d to annul virtually any court ruling over the past 20 years. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, said the remedy \u201callows the natural legal order to be restored in accordance with the principle of social justice\u201d. The European Union sees judicial independence undermined. \u201cWhat you have to ask is why on earth would a relatively inconsequential case in a provincial town like this one be so important for the Polish government?\u201d says Wojciech Sadurski, a law professor at the Universities of Sydney and Warsaw, and author of Poland\u2019s Constitutional Breakdown. He notes the minister\u2019s grounds for bringing the appeal relate to narrow questions of law, \u201ctoo trivial and technical, it seems to me, to qualify as a matter of \u2018social justice\u2019. So the answer is the case is important for the church \u00ba and the politicians need the support of the church to stay in power. I think it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d Sadurski can himself testify to the prevailing enthusiasm for politically motivated law suits; he\u2019s fighting a criminal case and two civil suits for defamation for tweets critical of the ruling party and neutered public broadcaster. To be fair, his is a non-exclusive club. Free speech is a fragile thing in contemporary Poland. And that\u2019s especially true when the talk is about its wartime past. Accusing \u201cthe Polish nation\u201d of complicity in the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities attracts civil penalties \u2013 and that was a backdown from the government under pressure from the US and Israel. The original 2018 law sought to jail offenders. Six million Poles were murdered during the second world war, three million of them Jews \u2013 nearly half of all the Jews killed in the Holocaust. Scholars see in the laws an attempt to whitewash the role of Poles in the Jewish genocide and substitute a nationalist fairytale in which victims cannot also be perpetrators. Ironically, that proposition is most powerfully and unwittingly debunked in the speech \u2013 conspicuously free \u2013 of nationalists themselves. In the same month the justice minister intervened in Drillich\u2019s case, thousands of nativists rallied in Warsaw against a US law requiring that Congress be informed about the progress of countries including Poland on restitution of Jewish assets seized during the second world war and its aftermath. The ruling party, says Holocaust historian Jan Grabowski, of the University of Ottawa in Canada, \u201chas created a wave of fear, paranoia and anger about the so-called Jewish threat\u201d. \u201cDrillich\u2019s is a very intriguing and interesting case that can have much larger ramifications than its immediate vicinity. It is part and parcel of a larger campaign to elevate the myth, the fantasy, of national innocence.\u201d By meddling in Drillich\u2019s case, Grabowski says, the government \u201ccan kill several birds with one stone\u201d. France 24 reported protestors wearing T-shirts reading \u201cdeath to the enemies of the fatherland\u201d. One man wore a shirt saying, \u201cI will not apologise for Jedwabne\u201d \u2013 a massacre of Jews by their Polish neighbours in 1941 under the German occupation. Polish nationalists argue that Poland, which did not capitulate to the Nazis \u2013 a fact many Holocaust scholars agree should be better known \u2013 has not been adequately compensated by Germany. In short, restitution is a loaded issue; one the government is keen to weaponise. Enter Drillich. Through Drillich\u2019s case, says Grabowski, the Holocaust historian, \u201cthe government wants to prove to the Polish nationalist electorate that the Jews are coming back to claim their properties\u201d. Drillich, meanwhile, pleads her cause near and far. She has lobbied Australian foreign affairs minister Marise Payne (who said the government wouldn\u2019t intervene in a private legal matter) and treasurer Josh Frydenberg, himself a descendent of Holocaust survivors, to take up her case with Polish authorities. Through intermediaries, she has asked senior Catholics in Australia to intervene with their counterparts in Poland. (\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of canon law,\u201d was one perfunctory response.) In July she wrote to the Vatican\u2019s representative in Poland, Archbishop Salvatore Pennacchio: \u201cMy family has been defamed in the Polish media and subjected to antisemitic abuse on social media, which includes tropes such as \u2018blood suckers and non-believers\u2019,\u201d Drillich wrote. \u201cThis year in his denunciation of antisemitism, Pope Francis stated that antisemitism in all its forms is \u2018completely contrary to Christian principles and every vision worthy of the human person\u2019. \u201cWhat does it mean that faithful parishioners pray on my stolen land and that I receive abuse?\u201d This week she\u2019s pinning her hopes on the extra scrutiny that will fall on Poland as world leaders prepare to descend on Warsaw for the 1 September commemoration. The question of what she\u2019d do if she won her claim seems almost incidental. \u201cIf I won, I\u2019d want an apology, I\u2019d want compensation and genuine reconciliation. I would not be looking to demolish the church.\u201d If she had her time again, would she still pursue justice, given she\u2019s clocked up roughly $100,000 in legal fees? Given everything? Drillich hesitates only briefly. \u201cThe very night my mother\u2019s grandfather was evicted (from the estate) by the Germans he slept on the balcony. He was 80-something. It was November. You can imagine how freezing it was.\u201d As for Blanka, freedom and a new life in Australia did not bring lasting peace. \u201cMy mother had this real spark. Then she developed depression and I watched her go silent.\u201d In a tragic, distorted echo of what Blanka encountered during the war, when Drillich was 13 she came home from school one day to find her mother had killed herself. \u201cThe Holocaust destroyed my family. I know how much the property meant to my mother. How brave she was to reclaim it after the war.\u201d She returns to the original question. \u201cHow could I not?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fraudsters are conning Chinese students out of tens of thousands of pounds just days after they arrive at universities in the UK. At the start of August, a Nottingham University student had her laptop, containing identifying information and bank details, stolen at Heathrow airport. A week later the student, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution, received a phone call purporting to be from the Chinese embassy. She was told the embassy had received information from Chinese police alleging she was connected to a money-laundering case in China. \u201cAt that time, I was already panicked,\u201d she said. The caller encouraged her to co-operate with the investigation, and she was provided with a case number and transferred to what was claimed to be a Chinese police office. The scammers, acting as police officers, provided more details around the case, and gave the student a URL to a website claiming to belong to the Chinese prosecutor general\u2019s office. The website contained details including the student\u2019s national ID card number, and the photograph used on that ID card. The student was told she would need to return to China and was threatened with imprisonment unless she made a videotaped statement via QQ, a Chinese social media platform. She did so after seeing a man dressed as a police officer via a video chat. \u201cI thought it will ruin my life if I cannot tackle this case,\u201d she said. \u201cI was too scared to think of anything except crying because they told me at the beginning I can\u2019t tell anyone, including parents, otherwise they will be implicated.\u201d The student transferred nearly \u00a330,000 as \u201cbail money\u201d to the fraudsters, fearing she would be deported if she didn\u2019t. It was only after talking to staff at the university that she realised it was a scam. Her parents reported the crime to police in China, and she reported it to UK police, although it was too late to recover the money. \u201cThis is the darkest day I have ever experienced,\u201d she wrote in a post on the Chinese social networking platform Weibo, designed to warn other students. She told the Observer that she had since been contacted by other Chinese students defrauded of money. At least three students have fallen foul of a similar scam at Newcastle University. A staff member at Into, a Brighton-based company that runs centres providing foundation courses for international students looking to study at universities in America and Britain, told the Observer: \u201cWe have had three instances this summer where students have answered the phone, given away their details, and lost their money.\u201d One student had lost \u00a312,000. \u201cThese are significant amounts they are losing. They believe if they don\u2019t pay the money they won\u2019t get their visa, or get their visa taken away.\u201d Into has sent an email to its students warning them about the scam. The number of Chinese students studying at UK universities has reached record levels. Applications from China have increased 30% year on year, and now there are more students from China studying at UK universities than from Northern Ireland, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency. Every year since 2012-13, more Chinese students have studied at UK institutions than students from all non-British EU countries combined. An official at the Chinese Embassy said: \u201cWe are warning all Chinese students when they come to the UK. What makes us feel heartbroken is that there are always Chinese students who fall for it.\u201d The scam is a simple but powerful, experts say. \u201cSocial engineers prey on vulnerable victims that can be manipulated,\u201d said Richard De Vere, a social engineering consultant, who is hired by companies to test their vulnerability to scams. \u201cWhen they have focused their nefarious techniques on a wealthy foreign student the task has been made even easier and more rewarding than most. \u201cDrilling down to their individual fears \u2013 being sent home to China a failure, being sent to prison, being ejected from the UK \u2013 would all be fears that would work to manipulate and gain the upper hand.\u201d A Nottingham University spokesperson called the scam appalling: \u201cIn addition to the serious financial implications for those students and their families, it overshadows what should be a happy and exciting time in their educational journey, and we are sorry that for some this has been their first experience of studying in the UK. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to help all new and returning students to protect themselves against scammers and phishing.\u201d The university is offering information about the scam to all international students arriving on campus, and has already briefed everyone enrolled at its Centre for English Language Education.",

      "bodyText": "Mauricio Pochettino has joked that Tottenham\u2019s \u00a3600m bank debt makes everyone at the club cry but it is the reason why they lack the spending power of their rivals and, to his mind, must be judged differently to them \u2013 including Arsenal, whom they face at the Emirates on Sunday. Pochettino highlighted how Arsenal have spent \u00a3174m on their attacking line in the last two years, taking first Alexandre Lacazette for \u00a346m from Lyon, then Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for \u00a356m from Borussia Dortmund and, this past summer, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 for \u00a372m from Lille, while the Tottenham manager\u2019s back-up striker is the 17-year-old academy prospect Troy Parrott, following the release of Fernando Llorente at the end of last season. Parrott has yet to make his first-team debut. Spurs took on the eye-watering debts to finance the construction of their new stadium \u2013 much as Arsenal did with the Emirates \u2013 and Pochettino knows he must continue to find different ways to make his club competitive. They slipped up last Sunday at home to Newcastle, which has made a positive result in the derby even more important. \u201cArsenal, in the last two years, signed Aubameyang, the best striker in Germany; Lacazette, the best striker in France and, one year after, P\u00e9p\u00e9,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIf you see us in five years \u2026 now our main striker is Harry Kane but our second specific striker is 17 years old, Troy Parrott.

Juventus were SO dominant in the first half. Credit to Ancelotti: he changed things at half time, both to a 4-4-2 and with the introduction of Lozano and Mario Rui, and Napoli were reborn after the break.</p> <p>Juventus absolutely crumbled \u2013 particularly De Ligt, which will be a real concern going forward with Chiellini\u2019s injury \u2013 and after letting Napoli get back to 3-3, it took an extraordinary own goal to once again tilt the match in Juve\u2019s favour. </p> <p>For Napoli, this must feel so cruel. Juventus so rarely drop points, particularly at home, and a 3-3 draw would have felt so good, and given them real confidence going forward. Now, this feels like something that could hang over them \u2013 and Koulibaly in particular \u2013 for a while. The Senegalese is an exceptional player \u2013 I would have him in my Serie A XI personally \u2013 but this is a crushing psychological blow. Perhaps the international break is coming at just the right time. He can go away, reset, come back for the game against Sampdoria on the 15 September and Napoli\u2019s Champions League tie against Liverpool two days later. </p> <p>Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did. See you next time. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d6adc808f08399d62f58cc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-31T20:47:46.920Z\">9.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s fair to say that two clubs</strong> had a slightly different reaction to that goal. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/juventusfcen/status/1167900165992112128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">90+2&#39; | \u26bd\ufe0f | GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAALLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Koulibaly, under no pressure whatsoever, shanks his clearance into his own net, hitting him somewhere on the shin and flying right into the top corner.

The <em>Derby della Lanterna</em> between Genoa and Sampdoria is derived from the Torre della Lanterna, the ancient landmark in Genoa. The <em>Derby della Madonnina</em> is named after the statue that sits atop of Milan\u2019s cathedral. The <em>Derby della Scala, </em>between Chievo and Hellas Verona, refers to the Scaligeri or della Scala aristocratic family, who were rulers of Verona during the Middle Ages and early Renaissance.</p> <p>Juventus v Napoli doesn\u2019t have a name. But few would argue that this (and the reverse fixture in Naples) are the highlights of the Serie A calendar, featuring the two best football teams in Italy. </p> <p>There are many questions to be answered tonight. Will Maurizio Sarri return to the dugout, following his bout of pneumonia? If he does, what sort of reception will he receive from the travelling Napoli fans \u2013 this is his first encounter with them since he left the southern club for Chelsea just over a year ago. </p> <p>Sarri, who has continued smoking cigarettes through his recovery \u2013 which saw him miss Juventus\u2019s 1-0 win over Parma on the opening weekend \u2013 could hand Matthijs de Ligt his full debut tonight, following the awful news that Giorgio Chiellini has ruptured his ACL ligament. The Italian defender will require surgery and should be out for around six months, which is a huge blow for the champions. That said, De Ligt and Bonucci at the back ain\u2019t too bad. </p> <p>Two seasons ago, Napoli won this fixture and looked as though they would go on to claim their first Serie A title since the days of Diego. That wasn\u2019t to be in the end, and Juventus\u2019s dominance has continued. Napoli are desperate to knock them off their perch. This is a prime opportunity, with their opponents reeling from injury and illness. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f5a17b08976d636a9077ba08ab6a897a67c9012\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f5a17b08976d636a9077ba08ab6a897a67c9012/0_67_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"That smile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">That smile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Montesi/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>7.45pm BST, 8.45pm in Turin</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That has to go down as one of the strangest games I\u2019ve ever seen. Juventus were SO dominant in the first half. Credit to Ancelotti: he changed things at half time, both to a 4-4-2 and with the introduction of Lozano and Mario Rui, and Napoli were reborn after the break. Juventus absolutely crumbled \u2013 particularly De Ligt, which will be a real concern going forward with Chiellini\u2019s injury \u2013 and after letting Napoli get back to 3-3, it took an extraordinary own goal to once again tilt the match in Juve\u2019s favour. For Napoli, this must feel so cruel. Juventus so rarely drop points, particularly at home, and a 3-3 draw would have felt so good, and given them real confidence going forward. Now, this feels like something that could hang over them \u2013 and Koulibaly in particular \u2013 for a while. The Senegalese is an exceptional player \u2013 I would have him in my Serie A XI personally \u2013 but this is a crushing psychological blow. Perhaps the international break is coming at just the right time. He can go away, reset, come back for the game against Sampdoria on the 15 September and Napoli\u2019s Champions League tie against Liverpool two days later. Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did. See you next time. It\u2019s fair to say that two clubs had a slightly different reaction to that goal. Koulibaly slumps to the turf. Hands over his eyes. Play had barely restarted before the referee calls him. Juventus have won one of the most extraordinary matches. Juventus have scored. Koulibaly has just scored an own goal for the ages. To deny Napoli one of the greatest comebacks of recent years. It\u2019s an absolutely spectacular winner. From the foul on Dybala, a loft ball is hoisted forward. Koulibaly, under no pressure whatsoever, shanks his clearance into his own net, hitting him somewhere on the shin and flying right into the top corner. I think you could cross the ball 1,000 times, and Koulibaly wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake. I\u2019m genuinely shook. What scenes in Turin! The crowd are going absolutely mental! 90 min: Three minutes added on here. Elmas is given a yellow card for bringing down Dybala. Up come the cavalry from the back. 89 min: Douglas Costaaaaaaaaaa \u2026 just over. The Brazilian picks up the loose ball just inside Napoli\u2019s box, steadies himself and curls a shot inches over the bar. Meret didn\u2019t move. That was a certain goal, if he kept it down. 88 min: Juventus have finally started to get a bit of a foothold again. 87 min: I hope Sarri is OK. Just imagine what his heart rate must be doing right now. 85 min: Since half-time, De Ligt has had a mare. A completely different performance to the first half, when he was composed and relaxed. Juventus are really missing Chiellini. 83 min: Douglas Costa picks up a yellow card for a forearm to block off Mario Rui. Juventus are rattled. They\u2019ve done it! The comeback is complete! Again, it\u2019s a set piece that is Juventus\u2019 undoing. From the free-kick, Zielinksi lofts a ball up to the back post. De Ligt is caught flatfooted, and Di Lorenzo thighs it Szcz\u0119sny from close range! 80 min: De Ligt does come back on, but doesn\u2019t look right. He instantly falls over in front of Lozano, who is then felled by Alex Sandro. The Brazilian gets a yellow card, that was a cynical challenge to stop the pacy Mexican from running clear. 78 min: Looks like De Ligt has a problem, which is a big problem for Juve, as they have used all their subs. Is it just cramp? The Dutchman is taking on some fluids and gels, and looks like he\u2019s going to try and come back on. If he doesn\u2019t, Juventus will have just 10 men. 75 min: Juventus can\u2019t get hold of the ball. Napoli are making all the running. Elmas, a 19-year-old signed from Fenerbahce in the summer, has showed some very tidy touches since coming on. 73 min: Both sides make a change: Elif Elmas on, Allan off for Napoli. Higuain off, Paulo Dybala on for Juventus. There are basically no defensive midfielders left. This is crazy. 70 min: WHAT. A. SAVE. This is surely a contender for save of the season from Meret. Douglas Costa was all alone on the edge of Napoli\u2019s box, took aim and arrowed a fierce drive right in the top corner. The ball was headed right into postage-stamp territory, before Meret tips it onto the bar! Game on? Game on! Really, really, really strange defending from De Ligt. Zielinski broke down the left, looked up and saw Lozano completely free in the box. De Ligt was just jogging and allowed the Mexican to run clear. A low cross came in and Lozano simply sidefooted the ball past Szcz\u0119sny! We have a real game on our hands now! A ray of hope for Napoli! A simple free-kick is lofted into the box, Manolas loses his man and plants a header into the far corner. Game on? 64 min: Douglas Costa has been the best player on the pitch tonight. The Brazilian and Gonzalo Higuain have really impressed. Matuidi, on a yellow card, catches Allan. He\u2019s got to be careful. Douglas Costa drives to the byline, cuts the ball back to the penalty spot and Ronaldo sweeps it in with his left foot! It wasn\u2019t the cleanest strike, bouncing into the corner, but it was still out of the reach of Meret. That\u2019s probably the match, isn\u2019t it? 60 min: Juventus make their second change: Khedira off, Emre Can on. You have to wonder what Rabiot and Bentancur are thinking. There is so much competition for those midfield spots at Juventus. And they\u2019ve still got Aaron Ramsey to come back from injury. 59 min: Manolas is penalised for careering into Ronaldo on Napoli\u2019s byline. Clumsy, and Pjanic has a dangerous free kick to the left of Napoli\u2019s box. But it\u2019s a poor delivery. 57 min: Juventus are looking a little bit lethargic in midfield. Zielinski is finding pockets of space as he comes off that left flank. Mertens forces Szcz\u0119sny into a save. Koulibaly makes a strong challenge on Douglas Costa (which was probably a foul). But Napoli are looking a lot better. 55 min: Good save from Meret! It\u2019s one he really should make, at a nice height, but it was powerfully struck, right in the corner. Corner to Juventus, cleared at the near post. 53 min: Yellow card for Matuidi, as he protests a little too vehemently at the referee. Dybala, meanwhile, is warming up along the touchline, and gets a round of applause from the Juve fans. 52 min: Callejon, who is now wearing the armband after the departure of Insigne, looks as though he fouled Matuidi but the referee waves play on. For a second, Napoli have a man over at the edge of Juventus\u2019 box, and Mertens flashes a shot just wide! Better from the visitors. 50 min: Napoli immediately look a lot more robust defensively with this new 4-4-2 system and are starting to make inroads going forward, too. Zielinski tries his luck but his left-foot shot is weak. 48 min: Amazing how quickly your stock can rise and fall over a summer. Last season, Higuain couldn\u2019t get in the Chelsea side \u2013 now he\u2019s leading the line for Juventus, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Douglas Costa either side of him, and has probably been the most decisive player tonight. 46 min: So I think Napoli are lining up now in a 4-4-2, with Lozano and Mertens up top, and Zielinski moving to left midfield, with Fabian and Allan in the middle. Indeed Lozano IS coming on! For Insigne, who apparently has a slight knock. Chucky makes his debut. Napoli look like they\u2019re making at least one change for the second half. Mario Rui is on for Ghoulam, who was on a yellow card and pulled out of a 50/50 challenge at the end of that first half. Lozano is also warming up, but it\u2019s unclear as to whether he\u2019s coming on now or later. Half-time reading I\u2019m off to get a cuppa, and to think about that Higuain pass to Khedira. Entertaining stuff. Would love to be a fly on the wall of Napoli\u2019s dressing room. Tactically they\u2019ve been all over the place, but they still carry a threat of course with Mertens and Insigne. I would love to see Lozano in the second half. 45+1 min: This is an incredibly open match. The quality in the final third has generally been poor from both teams, but Higuain and Costa have been the difference. 44 min: Di Lorenzo is the next into the book for a late tackle on Alex Sandro. The right back knows that was a bad challenge, grimaces and holds his hands up in apology. Yellow. 42 min: Ancelotti has long this tactical battle so far. Napoli don\u2019t have a discernible shape, in possession or not. That said, the game is quite open, and fair end to end. First Ronaldo drives into the box, but loses his footing under the challenge of Callejon. No penalty. Then Napoli stream forward, it\u2019s three on four \u2013 Insigne tries to work some space on the edge, but a magnificent standing tackle from Bonucci dispossesses the tiny Napoli forward. 40 min: Yellow card for Ghoulam, who trips Costa with an pretty ugly-looking tackle on Juventus\u2019s right wing. 38 min: De Ligt looks like he\u2019s been playing in this side for a decade. So composed on the ball. 36 min: Napoli started to play a little better now, Fabian and Zielinski have finally started stringing some passes together. 34 min: Another stoppage, as Bonucci receives further treatment for that cut. There\u2019s a fair bit of blood, but he should be OK to carry on. 33 min: Napoli just can\u2019t deal with Juventus\u2019s high press. Zielinski is going spare in the middle of the pitch as he tries to organise his teammates. 31 min: Khedira now hits the underside of the bar! Napoli are living a charmed life here, and lucky that Khedira\u2019s shot wasn\u2019t an inch lower. The ball cannons off the crossbar, just avoids the despairing Meret and Koulibaly hacks it clear! 29 min: Golden chance for Khedira! Oooooo, what a save from Meret, who is brave at diving at the German\u2019s feet to deflect it over for a corner. This all came about due to one of the most outrageous passes from Higuain. I genuinely have no idea how the Argentinian saw the run of Khedira, who was completely on Higuain\u2019s blindside \u2013 must have got a shout. Still, that is one of the passes of the season. If Juve go three up, you\u2019d have to say that would be curtains for Napoli. 25 min: Pjanic is starting to pull the strings in midfield. Juventus are looking the dominant side now, as Ronaldo starts to get some tricks and flicks out. 23 min: We\u2019ve got a stoppage in play, with Bonucci going down in a heap after jumping with Koulibaly at a corner. Replays show that Koulibaly did catch Bonucci with an elbow, with the Italian is all too keen to convey to the referee. It was probably accidental. Probably. In any case, there is no card brandished and the bleeding Bonucci is OK to continue, after a bit of treatment. 21 min: A nightmare start for Napoli, then. It\u2019s a long road back now. It had to be him! Higuain, who hasn\u2019t had a sniff so far this evening, scores a sensational goal against his former side. Again it was Juventus down the left, this time with Matuidi, and the Frenchman against squares the ball inside the Napoli box. Higuain kills the ball, spins on a sixpence to leave Koulibaly clutching thin air, and lashes it into the top corner. Wow! Wow! Wow! That is an assassin\u2019s finish. Higuain had THREE defenders around him and still carved some space out in the box. VAR check: the officials are just making sure that this didn\u2019t hit a Juventus hand prior to their counter-attack. Fabian had a shot at goal, but it hit Bonucci on the neck/shoulder. Goal given! Thirty seconds after coming on, Danilo scores his first Juventus goal! Straight from the corner, Juventus break in numbers. Costa carries the ball the length of the pitch on the left wing, breaks into the box, chops inside and squares it perfectly to Danilo, who was up in support. A first-time shot hits Meret, but deflects into the net! What an introduction! 15 min: De Sciglio looks like he\u2019s got a problem, he\u2019s going to have to be replaced! Unclear as to why. Danilo comes on his place. Straight swap. 14 min: Great save from Szcz\u0119sny! This so easily could have been 1-0, with Allan taking aim from the edge of the box. The former Arsenal keeper got just one hand to it, but turned it around the post. 13 min: Juventus have probably shaded the opening exchanges. Most of their play has come down the right, and Costa breaks forward once more. Koulibaly is caught up the pitch, but a poor De Sciglio cross and excellent covering from Allan means Juventus\u2019s attack breaks down. 11 min: I don\u2019t think Higuain has touched the ball yet. 9 min: Which is the better centre-back partnership? Bonucci and De Ligt or Manolas and Koulibaly? It\u2019s a close one, but I probably just prefer the Napoli pair, mainly because they\u2019ve both got pace to burn. 7 min: Both De Sciglio and Costa on Juventus right wing have started very strongly. Insigne and Ghoulam look a little rusty. 5 min: Matuidi neatly flicks the ball onto Ronaldo, who is forced wide but unleashes a ridiculous thwack at goal. The ball flies at 80mph right at Meret, who is able to palm it away. That was travelling, Ronaldo\u2019s first sighter. 4 min: Can you marry a tackle? Ronaldo drops deep and finds some space for the first time, but loses the ball as Koulibaly makes an inch-perfect slide on the Portuguese. Hard, but fair. 3 min: Looks like Napoli are lining up with a back three when they have the ball, and a back four when Juventus have it. 1 min: The Juventus fans shout Chiellini\u2019s name, and the Italian defender just about gets to his feet to accept the acclaim. Peeeeeeeeep! And we\u2019re off. So no Sarri in the dugout, although he is somewhere in the stadium, probably chain smoking. Chiellini is here, sitting in the stands with his crutches, and with his leg heavily strapped. Bonucci and Insigne shake hands at the toss. There\u2019s a full foot between them in height. The two are good friends from the national side and were joking in the tunnel a few moments ago. The teams are out! Juventus in their black and white, Napoli in their royal blue. Please do get in touch, via email on michael.butler@theguardian.com on Twitter @michaelbutler18. Remember, the transfer window is still open in Italy. That closes Monday night, and rumours are that Napoli are going to add Fernando Llorente to their squad. Nicky Bandini started her first Serie A blog of the season talking about Napoli\u2019s sensational 4-3 win over Fiorentina. It was some game. Highlights are here. It had it all: Twenty-five-yard screamers, controversial penalties, Kevin-Prince Boateng. The LOT. Sarri is in the house! Although it\u2019s not clear if he will watch from the stands or from the dugout. We\u2019ve had one other Serie A match today, Milan v Brescia. This is how it went down, courtesy of Reuters. AC Milan coach Marco Giampaolo earned his first win at the club as Hakan Calhanoglu struck early to clinch a 1-0 home victory over Brescia in Serie A on Saturday. The 18-times Italian champions failed to muster a single shot on target when they fell to a shock 1-0 defeat away to Udinese on the opening weekend. Yet Calhanoglu\u2019s headed goal after 12 minutes settled the nerves of the San Siro crowd and proved to be decisive in a cagey encounter. Milan take on another newly-promoted side when they travel to Hellas Verona after the international break. As expected, De Ligt starts, but Gonzalo Higu\u00edn continues to be preferred to Paolo Dybala, much to the frustration of many Juve fans. Napoli are more or less as expected \u2013 Gholam is preferred to Mario Rui at left back. Watch out for Hirving \u2018Chucky\u2019 Lozano on the bench. This is his first involvement in a Napoli squad since his \u00a334.4m move from PSV Eindhoven. He\u2019s a special player. Italy has many derbies, and because the Italians are a romantic sort, and their culture is a constant reference point to history, many of them have some splendid nicknames. The Derby della Lanterna between Genoa and Sampdoria is derived from the Torre della Lanterna, the ancient landmark in Genoa. The Derby della Madonnina is named after the statue that sits atop of Milan\u2019s cathedral. The Derby della Scala, between Chievo and Hellas Verona, refers to the Scaligeri or della Scala aristocratic family, who were rulers of Verona during the Middle Ages and early Renaissance. Juventus v Napoli doesn\u2019t have a name. But few would argue that this (and the reverse fixture in Naples) are the highlights of the Serie A calendar, featuring the two best football teams in Italy. There are many questions to be answered tonight. Will Maurizio Sarri return to the dugout, following his bout of pneumonia? If he does, what sort of reception will he receive from the travelling Napoli fans \u2013 this is his first encounter with them since he left the southern club for Chelsea just over a year ago. Sarri, who has continued smoking cigarettes through his recovery \u2013 which saw him miss Juventus\u2019s 1-0 win over Parma on the opening weekend \u2013 could hand Matthijs de Ligt his full debut tonight, following the awful news that Giorgio Chiellini has ruptured his ACL ligament. The Italian defender will require surgery and should be out for around six months, which is a huge blow for the champions. That said, De Ligt and Bonucci at the back ain\u2019t too bad. Two seasons ago, Napoli won this fixture and looked as though they would go on to claim their first Serie A title since the days of Diego. That wasn\u2019t to be in the end, and Juventus\u2019s dominance has continued. Napoli are desperate to knock them off their perch. This is a prime opportunity, with their opponents reeling from injury and illness. Kick off: 7.45pm BST, 8.45pm in Turin",

The coalition included the Houston Socialist Movement (<a href=\"http://houstoncommunistparty.com/category/houston-socialist-movement/\">HSM</a>), the <a href=\"https://www.domesticworkers.org/\">National Domestic Workers Alliance</a> and Familias Inmigrantes y Estudiantes en la Lucha (<a href=\"https://fielhouston.org/\">Fiel</a>), among others.</p> <p>The counter-demonstrators hoped to \u201cout-shout\u201d their counterparts, said David Michael Smith of HSM.</p> <p>\u201cThis is nothing but racism and religious bigotry on the part of the fascists,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cBeyond that, we don\u2019t think fascists should have a platform \u2026 so we\u2019d like to basically drive them off the streets on Saturday.\u201d</p> <p>A Houston police spokesperson said the department would be \u201cthere to ensure citizens are able to express and exercise their constitutional rights. We are there to ensure that it is a safe environment, and we staff accordingly to ensure the safety of everyone involved.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Greene and the Texas Patriot Network called for a similar protest. Around two dozen far-right demonstrators came out, conclusively outnumbered by anti-racist protesters. Leaked chat logs revealed that rightwingers identified potential targets for assault, among them Smith and other demonstrators, Houston Press <a href=\"https://www.houstonpress.com/news/texas-patriot-network-plans-to-protest-isna-11345149\">reported</a>.</p> <p>On Saturday, several dozen counter-demonstrators outnumbered about 15 far-right protesters, several of whom carried firearms, from Texas Patriot Network and other rightwing groups. Dozens of officers kept the two sides separated and confined to fenced-in areas. Police also patrolled on horseback.</p> <p>Counter-demonstrators held placards declaring \u201cStop Islamophobia\u201d and \u201cSmash Fascism.

      "bodyText": "In Houston on Saturday, an annual Islamic convention hosting presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Julian Castro braced for an armed far-right protest and a counter-demonstration. The 56th Islamic Society of North America (Isna) convention was billed as one of the largest yearly events held by Muslim American advocacy groups. Castro and Sanders were slated to take the stage for one-on-one presidential forums. Organizers estimated around 30,000 would attend the three-day event. \u201cWe are really happy [Castro and Sanders] are coming in to address our community,\u201d Lubabah Abdullah, an Isna board member, told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019ve recently realized the Muslim community has a strong voting bloc, if we do go out and register and actually show up to vote.\u201d In the 2018 midterm elections, Muslim Americans in four key states \u2013 Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia \u2013 showed up to the ballot box at a rate of 25% higher than the 2014 midterms, according to a study by the advocacy group Emgage. After coming to office in January 2017, the Trump administration introduced a travel ban targeting mostly Muslim-majority countries, slashed the number of refugees admitted to the US to an all-time low of 30,000 per year, and drummed up the threat of \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d attempting to cross the southern border. John Esposito, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Bridge Initiative, a project focusing on Islamophobia, said Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric \u201cplay into an idea of a white nation\u201d while demonising Muslims, immigrants, refugees and others. \u201cPeople are afraid to go to a mosque or a meeting of a major Muslim organization,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe most dangerous part is when you\u2019ve got the president of the United States \u2026 engaging in this kind of [violent rhetoric].\u201d Abdullah, also executive director of the Council for American Islamic Relations (Cair) Houston chapter, said organizers of the convention had worked closely with local and federal law enforcement. \u201cUnfortunately [anti-Muslim sentiment] has become the norm \u2026 and unfortunately we\u2019ve seen a dramatic rise in hate crimes and Islamophobia,\u201d she said. In late July, the California-based Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism (CSHE) found hate crimes have swelled by 9% in 30 large US cities. In addition to 75 hate crimes targeting Muslims during the first half of 2019, Cair recorded at least 759 anti-Muslim bias incidents, a pace expected to reach a 22% increase this year over 2014. Liza Acevedo, deputy press secretary for Castro, told the Guardian American Muslims \u201cplay a critical role in shaping our nation\u2019s culture, economy and political process\u201d. \u201cAt a time when our president continually scapegoats and vilifies the Islamic faith for political gain, candidates should show up and speak directly to these communities about their plans to support them in the years ahead,\u201d she added. In the weeks leading up to the convention, the far-right, anti-Muslim Texas Patriot Network and local radio host James \u201cDoc\u201d Greene called for a demonstration against what it claimed was evidence of collusion between \u201cleftists\u201d and the \u201cMuslim Brotherhood\u201d, according to a now-defunct Facebook page. Informing participants that the \u201cTexans Against Radical Islam\u201d protest was \u201copen carry\u201d, the page described the Isna convention as a \u201cterrorist fundraiser\u201d and stated: \u201cTexans will stand against this tyranny.\u201d Texas Patriot Network did not reply to requests for comment but rightwing groups have targeted Isna for years, apparently owing to its inclusion as an unindicted co-conspirator in the widely criticized Holy Land Five case in 2007. A US district court judge later ruled the government violated the rights of Isna and other Muslim groups. In response to Saturday\u2019s anti-Muslim rally, civil rights groups, anti-racist organizations and anti-fascist activists announced a counter-protest. The coalition included the Houston Socialist Movement (HSM), the National Domestic Workers Alliance and Familias Inmigrantes y Estudiantes en la Lucha (Fiel), among others. The counter-demonstrators hoped to \u201cout-shout\u201d their counterparts, said David Michael Smith of HSM. \u201cThis is nothing but racism and religious bigotry on the part of the fascists,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cBeyond that, we don\u2019t think fascists should have a platform \u2026 so we\u2019d like to basically drive them off the streets on Saturday.\u201d A Houston police spokesperson said the department would be \u201cthere to ensure citizens are able to express and exercise their constitutional rights. We are there to ensure that it is a safe environment, and we staff accordingly to ensure the safety of everyone involved.\u201d In 2018, Greene and the Texas Patriot Network called for a similar protest. Around two dozen far-right demonstrators came out, conclusively outnumbered by anti-racist protesters. Leaked chat logs revealed that rightwingers identified potential targets for assault, among them Smith and other demonstrators, Houston Press reported. On Saturday, several dozen counter-demonstrators outnumbered about 15 far-right protesters, several of whom carried firearms, from Texas Patriot Network and other rightwing groups. Dozens of officers kept the two sides separated and confined to fenced-in areas. Police also patrolled on horseback. Counter-demonstrators held placards declaring \u201cStop Islamophobia\u201d and \u201cSmash Fascism. Anti-Muslim demonstrators held signs that said \u201cNo Sharia USA\u201d and \u201cAll Women Equal USA\u201d. Greene addressed convention attendees. \u201cWelcome to Houston, home to the largest Islamic population in America,\u201d he repeated, through a loudspeaker. He and others led prayers. Many rightwingers wore pro-Trump shirts and hats and waved \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d signs. \u201cI am very concerned for the souls of these Muslims,\u201d Greene told the Guardian, \u201cso that they may also enter into the joy of being a Christian. The only policies [Trump] introduced were not anti-Muslim; they were anti-terrorist \u2026 We love the fact that he\u2019s stopping illegal immigration.\u201d Greene claimed Muslim Americans attempt to \u201cblend in\u201d in US society and hide their real beliefs. He also accused \u201chooligan Castro\u201d and \u201ccrazy Bernie\u201d of being part of a \u201ccommunist\u201d plot. Around 10 demonstrators from the Westboro Baptist Church held a separate rally. Known for protesting at the funerals of soldiers and against LGBTQ events, they held signs that read \u201cGod hates Islam\u201d and stomped on flags of Middle Eastern countries. On the anti-fascist side, a handful were armed with rifles and some wore masks. \u201cNo hate, no fear, Muslims are welcome here,\u201d they chanted. Falko Mueller, an activist with Houston United Front Against Fascism, said the demonstration was a \u201cshow of solidarity\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not Muslim, but I\u2019m here to stand with people under attack,\u201d he said.

Often MPs are quite happy to overlook detail but, in this case, a poorly worded bill could give Johnson the opportunity to wriggle out of getting an extension to the Brexit deadline.

Corbyn wants the former for the same reason his opponents in the Lib Dems and anti-no deal Tories are so against it: he would be in Downing Street and therefore voters would find it much easier to imagine him as prime minister when asked to do so in an election.

Clearly, this is not a prime minister people can trust.</p> <p>Last week the Advertising Standards Agency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/27/home-office-settlement-scheme-ad-banned-misleading-eu-citizens\" title=\"\">banned a Home Office ad</a> about EU citizens registering to stay because it was misleading. And the government registration app won\u2019t be ready until the end of the year (months after the home secretary plans to scrap their rights).</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/08/battle-begins/\" title=\"\"><em>Spectator</em></a> \u2013 the magazine Johnson once edited \u2013 warns: \u201cThere are worrying signs of sloppiness, even negligence, in the way the Home Office is handling all this.\u201d</p> <p>We already know the kind of consequences such decisions can have. The hurt caused to the Windrush generation by the government\u2019s hostile environment policy is now in danger of being repeated on an even bigger scale, with around 3 million EU citizens living in the UK.</p> <p>Every week I meet EU citizens who are stressed about their future in this country. Sadly, many are leaving \u2013 taking with them their skills and support from our NHS, social care and schools.</p> <p>The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, let the cat out of the bag when he <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-49516694/defence-secretary-ben-wallace-overheard-discussing-parliament-suspension\" title=\"\">told his French counterpart</a> that parliament is being suspended because \u201cwe\u2019ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority\u201d.</p> <p>There is an obvious and practical solution when a government finds itself without a majority. It is not to undermine democracy. The solution is to let the people decide, and call a general election.</p> <p>This week could be the last chance to stop Johnson\u2019s Tory government taking us over a no-deal cliff edge that will threaten jobs and our NHS, mean a restoration of the border in Ireland \u2013 threatening peace \u2013 and cause shortages of food and medical supplies from day one.</p> <p>Industry after industry is warning of the deeply damaging impact of a no-deal Brexit. During the summer I listened to the fears of farmers, car workers, NHS staff and many others across the country.</p> <p>And as Trump\u2019s close ally, the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, lets the Amazon rainforest burn, it could not be clearer that we need to build stronger relations with other international allies in the global fight against the climate emergency.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A different future is possible, and real change can be delivered for every community, nation and region of our country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The threat of a no-deal crash is creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. But I am determined to ensure Labour brings people together by giving hope and confidence that a different future is possible, and real change can be delivered for every community, nation and region of our country.</p> <p>There is a rapidly growing movement of people determined to stop no deal. Last week spontaneous protests sprung up around the country.</p> <p>People are angry that those who claimed we would \u201ctake back control\u201d are now keeping control for themselves \u2013 with the aim of handing it over to Donald Trump and US corporate giants in a race-to-the-bottom free market trade deal.</p> <p>This weekend, Labour MPs have been joining more protests across the country. People are determined that they will not allow a phoney populist cabal in Downing Street, in hock to the vested interests of the richest, to deny them their democratic voice.</p> <p>It is the people, not an unelected prime minister, who should determine our country\u2019s future.</p> <p>A general election is the democratic way forward. And in that election Labour will give the people the chance to take back control and have the final say in a public vote, with credible options for both sides, including the option to Remain.</p> <p>In the maelstrom of the coming days and weeks, we need to remember that sovereignty doesn\u2019t rest in Downing Street, or even in parliament, but with the people.</p> <p><em>Jeremy Corbyn is leader of the Labour</em> <em>party</em></p>",

But you don\u2019t have to go back to 2017 to find our new prime minister flip-flopping and U-turning to suit whatever position he has adopted at the time. In late July he promised EU citizens he would legislate to protect their rights. Now we learn the home secretary will end freedom of movement on 1 November without any new immigration rules or protections in its place. Clearly, this is not a prime minister people can trust. Last week the Advertising Standards Agency banned a Home Office ad about EU citizens registering to stay because it was misleading. And the government registration app won\u2019t be ready until the end of the year (months after the home secretary plans to scrap their rights). As the Spectator \u2013 the magazine Johnson once edited \u2013 warns: \u201cThere are worrying signs of sloppiness, even negligence, in the way the Home Office is handling all this.\u201d We already know the kind of consequences such decisions can have. The hurt caused to the Windrush generation by the government\u2019s hostile environment policy is now in danger of being repeated on an even bigger scale, with around 3 million EU citizens living in the UK. Every week I meet EU citizens who are stressed about their future in this country. Sadly, many are leaving \u2013 taking with them their skills and support from our NHS, social care and schools. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, let the cat out of the bag when he told his French counterpart that parliament is being suspended because \u201cwe\u2019ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority\u201d. There is an obvious and practical solution when a government finds itself without a majority. It is not to undermine democracy. The solution is to let the people decide, and call a general election. This week could be the last chance to stop Johnson\u2019s Tory government taking us over a no-deal cliff edge that will threaten jobs and our NHS, mean a restoration of the border in Ireland \u2013 threatening peace \u2013 and cause shortages of food and medical supplies from day one. Industry after industry is warning of the deeply damaging impact of a no-deal Brexit. During the summer I listened to the fears of farmers, car workers, NHS staff and many others across the country. And as Trump\u2019s close ally, the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, lets the Amazon rainforest burn, it could not be clearer that we need to build stronger relations with other international allies in the global fight against the climate emergency. The threat of a no-deal crash is creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. But I am determined to ensure Labour brings people together by giving hope and confidence that a different future is possible, and real change can be delivered for every community, nation and region of our country. There is a rapidly growing movement of people determined to stop no deal. Last week spontaneous protests sprung up around the country. People are angry that those who claimed we would \u201ctake back control\u201d are now keeping control for themselves \u2013 with the aim of handing it over to Donald Trump and US corporate giants in a race-to-the-bottom free market trade deal. This weekend, Labour MPs have been joining more protests across the country. People are determined that they will not allow a phoney populist cabal in Downing Street, in hock to the vested interests of the richest, to deny them their democratic voice. It is the people, not an unelected prime minister, who should determine our country\u2019s future. A general election is the democratic way forward. And in that election Labour will give the people the chance to take back control and have the final say in a public vote, with credible options for both sides, including the option to Remain. In the maelstrom of the coming days and weeks, we need to remember that sovereignty doesn\u2019t rest in Downing Street, or even in parliament, but with the people.

Asked whether he was afraid of being arrested, Chan said he had lost sleep, but the wellbeing of Hong Kong mattered more to him. \u201cIt\u2019s OK for me to be arrested,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not OK to lose our beloved Hong Kong.\u201d * Names have been changed to protect interviewees\u2019 identities",

      "body": "<p>For much of August the plan<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\" title=\"\"> to shut down parliament for five weeks</a> was kept a very tight secret at the heart of government. For the few Whitehall officials who were made aware of it early on, however, it was not difficult to decipher whose fingerprints were all over it. It was clear to that small group that the bombshell idea had been hatched by Boris Johnson\u2019s closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, and No 10\u2019s director of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa.</p> \n<p>Cummings has long been known at Westminster for his disdain for Whitehall and the way the entire system of British government works. He doesn\u2019t mince his words or tolerate those he regards as fools. \u201cIf he meets resistance from ministers or officials he will just tell them to fuck off, whoever they are,\u201d said one Whitehall source, who has worked with him.</p> \n<p>In 2016 Cummings ran the successful Vote Leave campaign to take the UK out of the EU, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/commons-report-rules-dominic-cummings-in-contempt-of-parliament\" title=\"\">and was later held in contempt of parliament</a> for failing to appear before a select committee investigating the spread of fake news during the Brexit referendum.</p> \n<p>Da Costa, on the other hand, is less well known and far less abrasive. She served under Theresa May for a time advising on parliamentary issues. As well being a Brexiter, Da Costa has a fascination with parliament and, say friends, believes in the need to strengthen the power of the executive in relation to parliament in order to get business done.</p> \n<p>Having found themselves thrown together in Johnson\u2019s new team at No 10 in July, Cummings and Da Costa found common cause. \u201cIt was obvious that prorogation was the Cummings/Da Costa masterplan,\u201d said an insider.</p> \n<p>Apart from the prime minister, who insisted repeatedly during his campaign for the Tory leadership that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/boris-johnson-refuses-rule-out-forcing-through-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">he was \u201cnot attracted\u201d to the idea</a> of proroguing parliament while never actually ruling it out, few even in the cabinet heard anything about what was being planned until a week ago.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6e3847f-f534-48fa-9919-609e4c49cad2\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(August 24, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong> The story breaks</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Observer breaks the story that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\">Boris Johnson has sought legal advice on closing parliament for five weeks</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(August 27, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Leaks spread</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Other media organisations begin to receive leaks that Johnson will make a statement on prorogation</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(August 28, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Visit to Balmoral</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Three privy counsellors, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, travel to Balmoral to tell the Queen of the prorogation plan.

With the clock ticking towards parliament\u2019s return on 3 September, advice on the legality of a five-week prorogration before a Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October had to be sought.

Last Friday an email between a Whitehall official and No 10 was leaked to this newspaper. It made clear that Johnson had approached Cox for advice on a five-week suspension from around 9 September to 14 October. Cox\u2019s initial view, the correspondence made clear, was that it would probably be legal, unless various court actions being planned by Remainers to block prorogation were successful. Downing Street\u2019s official response when asked about the leak was, at first, muted. \u201cNo 10 officials ask for legal and policy advice every day,\u201d said a government source.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"472bf1811cca536a312312d435f9ef04c1bdcb5c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/472bf1811cca536a312312d435f9ef04c1bdcb5c/0_156_2902_3625/801.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings arrives at Downing Street.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings arrives at Downing Street.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But when<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\" title=\"\"> the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\" title=\"\"> story </a>broke last Saturday evening, as Johnson and his team were in Biarritz for the G7 summit preparing for meetings with US president Donald Trump and EU council president Donald Tusk the next day, Downing Street changed tack and tried to dismiss the story in a way that was to backfire spectacularly.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s press team issued a statement saying that \u201cthe claim that the government is considering proroguing parliament in September in order to stop MPs debating Brexit is entirely false\u201d.

      "bodyText": "For much of August the plan to shut down parliament for five weeks was kept a very tight secret at the heart of government. For the few Whitehall officials who were made aware of it early on, however, it was not difficult to decipher whose fingerprints were all over it. It was clear to that small group that the bombshell idea had been hatched by Boris Johnson\u2019s closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, and No 10\u2019s director of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa. Cummings has long been known at Westminster for his disdain for Whitehall and the way the entire system of British government works. He doesn\u2019t mince his words or tolerate those he regards as fools. \u201cIf he meets resistance from ministers or officials he will just tell them to fuck off, whoever they are,\u201d said one Whitehall source, who has worked with him. In 2016 Cummings ran the successful Vote Leave campaign to take the UK out of the EU, and was later held in contempt of parliament for failing to appear before a select committee investigating the spread of fake news during the Brexit referendum. Da Costa, on the other hand, is less well known and far less abrasive. She served under Theresa May for a time advising on parliamentary issues. As well being a Brexiter, Da Costa has a fascination with parliament and, say friends, believes in the need to strengthen the power of the executive in relation to parliament in order to get business done. Having found themselves thrown together in Johnson\u2019s new team at No 10 in July, Cummings and Da Costa found common cause. \u201cIt was obvious that prorogation was the Cummings/Da Costa masterplan,\u201d said an insider. Apart from the prime minister, who insisted repeatedly during his campaign for the Tory leadership that he was \u201cnot attracted\u201d to the idea of proroguing parliament while never actually ruling it out, few even in the cabinet heard anything about what was being planned until a week ago. One who was kept in the loop was Michael Gove, who had employed Cummings as his special adviser when education secretary, and is now in charge of no-deal preparations. Gove spoke out strongly against prorogation during his failed leadership bid: \u201cI think it would be wrong for many reasons. I think it would not be true to the best traditions of British democracy,\u201d he said. But that was the past, and once moves were in train, Gove put up no resistance.

      "body": "<p>She is not the first working mother to walk away from a dream job and sadly she won\u2019t be the last. But few do it with the blunt candour of Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader who resigned last week.</p> <p>Since having her son, Finn, she said, the idea of disappearing on the campaign trail for weeks on end <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/ruth-davidson-quits-as-scottish-tory-leader\" title=\"\">filled her with \u201cdread\u201d</a>. Not for her the sugary euphemisms about putting family first; instead, she evokes the visceral, animal tug of anxiety at being too far away. Sometimes, too far means being in a different time zone, listening helplessly to your child cry down a phone line. Sometimes, even being in the same room isn\u2019t quite close enough. Everyone has a different threshold, and it can easily change from day to day, but still, too far is too far, and you know it when you feel it. Yet even to say her decision is understandable is to enter a minefield.</p> <p>The question of whether parenthood changes the way we feel about work is so inflammatory for women \u2013 it\u2019s only rarely asked of men, although fatherhood turns plenty of them inside out too \u2013 because the answer is so often weaponised against us. Reports of Davidson having lost some of her \u201cfire and passion\u201d since returning from maternity leave will have had some women shouting at the radio, even if it only reflects common gossip at Holyrood. What does that say about the rest of us, if a force of nature like Davidson is deemed to have lost her mojo to motherhood?</p> <p>The lazy belief that it\u2019s only \u201cnatural\u201d for women to shed their ambition along with the placenta is one of the single most pernicious obstacles to female success and it\u2019s all the more maddening when used to obscure the real reasons some women quit after having children. Sideline and undermine a new mother thoroughly enough on her return and she may well get the message and leave. But who, exactly, has lacked commitment to whom here?</p> <p>Everyone is different, of course. The inconvenient truth is that some women genuinely don\u2019t feel the same about work after babies, while others can\u2019t wait to get back. But for many, ambition doesn\u2019t die so much as evolve. Work comes to feel in some senses more important, not less. If you\u2019re going to be away from the kids, to resist that fierce gravitational pull, then it had damn well better be worth it. Rather like being told you have months to live, motherhood doesn\u2019t half focus the mind.</p> <p>Tolerance for adults behaving like toddlers in the office plummets once you have the real thing at home, while time takes on new significance when there\u2019s suddenly never enough of it.

      "bodyText": "She is not the first working mother to walk away from a dream job and sadly she won\u2019t be the last. But few do it with the blunt candour of Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader who resigned last week. Since having her son, Finn, she said, the idea of disappearing on the campaign trail for weeks on end filled her with \u201cdread\u201d. Not for her the sugary euphemisms about putting family first; instead, she evokes the visceral, animal tug of anxiety at being too far away. Sometimes, too far means being in a different time zone, listening helplessly to your child cry down a phone line. Sometimes, even being in the same room isn\u2019t quite close enough. Everyone has a different threshold, and it can easily change from day to day, but still, too far is too far, and you know it when you feel it. Yet even to say her decision is understandable is to enter a minefield. The question of whether parenthood changes the way we feel about work is so inflammatory for women \u2013 it\u2019s only rarely asked of men, although fatherhood turns plenty of them inside out too \u2013 because the answer is so often weaponised against us. Reports of Davidson having lost some of her \u201cfire and passion\u201d since returning from maternity leave will have had some women shouting at the radio, even if it only reflects common gossip at Holyrood. What does that say about the rest of us, if a force of nature like Davidson is deemed to have lost her mojo to motherhood? The lazy belief that it\u2019s only \u201cnatural\u201d for women to shed their ambition along with the placenta is one of the single most pernicious obstacles to female success and it\u2019s all the more maddening when used to obscure the real reasons some women quit after having children. Sideline and undermine a new mother thoroughly enough on her return and she may well get the message and leave. But who, exactly, has lacked commitment to whom here? Everyone is different, of course. The inconvenient truth is that some women genuinely don\u2019t feel the same about work after babies, while others can\u2019t wait to get back. But for many, ambition doesn\u2019t die so much as evolve. Work comes to feel in some senses more important, not less. If you\u2019re going to be away from the kids, to resist that fierce gravitational pull, then it had damn well better be worth it. Rather like being told you have months to live, motherhood doesn\u2019t half focus the mind. Tolerance for adults behaving like toddlers in the office plummets once you have the real thing at home, while time takes on new significance when there\u2019s suddenly never enough of it. And all the while, running through your mind like a rolling news headline, the nagging question: is this really worth peeling a howling child off my leg every morning? What exactly am I achieving here? The decision to go is often an expression not just of maternal love but of professional frustration and it isn\u2019t always clear where one ends and the other begins. On the left, those disappointed that she didn\u2019t take a parting shot at Boris Johnson have accused Davidson of using motherhood as an excuse for what they\u2019re sure must really be a politically motivated departure.

It really is very simple: if Liverpool win their remaining 35 league games, they will be champions for the first time since 1990. Seriously, though, if they want to finish above Manchester City they will probably need to win at least 30 matches, so games like this become close to a must-win - even at the end of August.</p> <p>Winning has become a happy habit for Liverpool. This is probably the most joyous time to be a Liverpool supporter since April 1988, and victory tonight would set a new club record of 13 consecutive league wins. </p> <p>With the scorching form of their front three, few would bet against them. Jurgen Klopp would quite like a first clean sheet of the season. But the main thing is that his team get three points. </p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 5.30pm.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-31T15:51:47.137Z\">at 4.51pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with Paul Wilson\u2019s match report from Turf Moor. Bye! And here\u2019s Virgil van Dijk \u201cIt\u2019s a big achievement [winning 13 league games in a row], but we have nothing to show for it yet. All we can do is keep going. We know how tough it is. We knew it would be tough today; Burnley away is difficult for any team and I think we dealt with it professionally. \u201cWe prepared very well. We trained in the week on exactly how they would play; luckily we have Divock Origi, who could help us prepare.\u201d Trent Alexander-Arnold speaks \u201cWe got a bit of luck with the deflection but a goal\u2019s a goal so none of us will complain. I\u2019m not fussed about it being an own goal rather than my goal; it\u2019s all about the team. We got a clean sheet which is the most important thing for us barring the win. We defended the long balls unbelievably.\u201d Still want more? Bet you do. \u201cComfortably the best Liverpool side of the last three decades,\u201d says Paul Griffin. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure whether Torben Piechnik and Istvan Kozma would get in this team.\u201d Peep peep! Liverpool go back to the top of the table - and set a new club record with their 13th consecutive league win. They are a truly great side, and if it wasn\u2019t for Manchester City they would be champions already. 90+1 min \u201cLove Salah though I do, one day his selfishness is going to cost us,\u201d says Tomo Barneby. \u201cFirmino and Mane would have both got another goal if he\u2019d passed rather than shooting when badly placed. Mane\u2019s now sitting on the bench fuming. Appreciate strikers need to be selfish, but the other two aren\u2019t at all. Long term it could well be a problem.\u201d He wasn\u2019t always this selfish, was he? It seems, at least from afar, that he changed after that amazing first season, probably because he\u2019s desperate to repeat it. 90 min In the first of three added minutes, Wijnaldum runs onto Salah\u2019s through pass and tries to go round Pope, who dives to his right to claim the ball. 89 min Rodriguez almost dirties Liverpool\u2019s sheet in the last couple of minutes. He moved into the area and went around Adrian, who did well to spread himself and block the eventual shot. He\u2019ll be desperate for a first clean sheet as Liverpool goalkeeper. 87 min Last season Liverpool finished second with 97 points. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if somebody reaches 100 points without winning the league this season. They and Manchester City are a million miles ahead of the rest. 85 min Crikey, Mane is absolutely fuming about something. He has just been subbed, along with Firmino, with Origi and Shaqiri replacing them. He\u2019s ranting and raving on the bench, possibly about Salah\u2019s non-pass a moment ago. For all his brilliance, Salah is one of the most selfish footballers I\u2019ve ever seen. Of course, that selfishness often informs his brilliance as well. 84 min \u201cWhat gave me the idea,\u201d says James Russell. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can read explain please.\u201d Please don\u2019t be weird, James. It\u2019s just a game of football. 83 min Salah is denied a goal by a brilliant tackle from Pieters. He should have given the goal to Mane but tried to go it alone, and he would have scored but for that pesky Dutchman. 82 min \u201cYou\u2019re definitely right about that 30-year span,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI think the real key game was the absolute destruction of Barcelona. That was the match that gave the squad the swagger and belief to match the talent. Certainly helped my poor old nerves. I haven\u2019t worried about a match since, and I am NOT nostalgic for days of nail chewing!\u201d Roberto Firmino secures a record 13th consecutive league win for Liverpool with a fine finish. He curled a long pass to Salah, who wriggled away from two defenders on the edge of the box. He overran the ball slightly, but Firmino was backing up the play and he cracked an empathic, first-time shot into the bottom corner from 20 yards It\u2019s there! 79 min Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s rising shot is well held by Pope. 76 min Wood puts Rodriguez through on goal, but he\u2019s miles offside and Adrian saves anyway. 75 min The game was quite tight until that freakish opening goal, but since then Liverpool have been cruising towards victory. 74 min \u201cMBM earlier described Manchester City as boring,\u201d says James Russell. \u201cIn a similar display of authority Liverpool are eulogised as the best Liverpool team in the last 30 years. I thought the Guardian was about independent unbiased coverage not an agenda?\u201d I don\u2019t know what gave you that idea. The Manchester Guardian has always had an agenda against Manchester City. 73 min Ashley Barnes is replaced by Jay Rodriguez. 72 min Barnes is fouled on the left wing by Matip. McNeil\u2019s cross is headed over from six yards by Tarkowski, who was put off by the presence of Van Dijk. 71 min Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain replaces Jordan Henderson. 69 min Westwood\u2019s excellent through ball towards Wood is intercepted by ... Ashley Barnes. He\u2019s had a bad night. 64 min Burnley are hanging on their 2-0 deficit. Firmino\u2019s scissor kick bounces up and is headed behind by Mee. It feels like a third goal is imminent. 63 min Liverpool have this game completely under control. The authority of their play, especially the way they have quietly disarmed Burnley, has been so impressive. They are, by some distance, the best Liverpool team of the last 30 years. 61 min Mo Salah\u2019s selfishness costs Liverpool a third goal. He ran at the defence, dragging them all over the place before twisting back onto his right foot at the edge of the D. There was a simple, angled pass on, which would have given Firmino a simple chance. Instead Salah chose to Lingard a tame shot straight through to Pope. In his defence, he knew immediately and apologised to Firmino. 60 min Alexander-Arnold instead guides the free-kick to the edge of the area, where Salah belts a first-time shot that is blocked. 60 min Fabinho is bumped to the ground by Tarkowski, just outside the area on the left wing. Alexander-Arnold might have a shot here. 58 min Salah\u2019s low cross is intercepted by Tarkowski, who tries to run the ball out of the area and is robbed by Firmino. He has a shot blocked, and moments later Salah hits the side netting from a ludicrous angle. 56 min Van Dijk heads the free-kick away. Of course he does. 55 min McNeil twists Alexander-Arnold near the corner flag and is fouled. For all the genius of his crossing, Alexander-Arnold\u2019s one-on-one defending is one of Liverpool\u2019s few weak links. 54 min Barnes is penalised for kneeing Matip in the back while jumping for a high ball. 50 min Nothing much to report. Liverpool look very comfortable, and Mane in particular looks like making something happen every time he gets the ball. He\u2019s such a good player, who doesn\u2019t always get the credit he deserves. 47 min \u201cListening to the match on the radio whilst following your MBM (it\u2019s a very busy afternoon in work), and due to the vagaries of listening online you\u2019re about three minutes ahead of Talksport,\u201d says Alexander Lewis. \u201cThus I\u2019ve read about both goals well before hearing them. Is it normal that on neither occasion did I believe that Liverpool had scored until the commentary caught up? How long do Liverpool have to be good before I lose the fear that you\u2019re just having a laugh, and Burnley are really 3-0 up?\u201d It\u2019s all a big Truman Show. Wait till you find out what really happened against Spurs in Madrid. 46 min Peep peep! Half-time reading Peep peep! Liverpool are well on their way to setting a new club record of 13 consecutive league wins. Chris Wood\u2019s freakish own goal was followed by a clinical second from Sadio Mane; and though Burnley have worked like beasts, Liverpool have kept them at arms length with the minimum of fuss. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45 min Barnes drags a tame shot wide from 22 yards. 43 min Ashley Barnes is having a stinker. It doesn\u2019t help that he\u2019s up against van Dijk, but he has struggled to hold the ball up all night. Now he has a half chance after combining with Wood, but spanks it high over the bar from the edge of the area. 42 min \u201cScratch that,\u201d says Seth Wheeler. \u201cStill class though.\u201d 41 min \u201cTrent meant it,\u201d says Seth Wheeler. \u201cHe shook his leg forward at the contact rather than wrapping it round. Pure class.\u201d Did he mean the deflection as well? 40 min That quick one-two has flattened Burnley, who would have been pretty happy with their defensive performance in the first half hour. 38 min \u201cWhat history between Liverpool and Burnley?\u201d says Callum Macauley. \u201cAll that springs to mind is Joe Gomez\u2019s injury/Henderson\u2019s red card.\u201d Exactly. That was Liverpool at their most ruthless. Ben Mee played a dreadful pass straight to Firmino, just inside the Burnley half. He ran 25 yards, drawing defenders towards him all the while, and then eased the ball to his left to find the overlapping Mane. He opened his body to steer a precise low shot into the far corner with his right foot. Brilliant finish. Lovely goal! 36 min Replays show that Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross took a deflection off Wood, so it will, to the disgust of Fantasy Football folk everywhere, go down as an own-goal. Alexander-Arnold played the ball down the right to Henderson and made himself available for the return. When it came he tried to whip a trademark first-time cross to the far post. But it didn\u2019t curl as expected and, with Pope stranded, the ball dropped into the far side of the net. Trent Alexander-Arnold scores with a mishit cross! 30 min Barnes, not for the last time tonight, walks into Liverpool\u2019s offside trap. They have dealt with Barnes and Wood very efficiently so far. 28 min \u201cYes, as you say, there is a little bit of history,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cBut, frankly, Burnley should just be thankful for the chance to watch Officially The Best Footballer In Europe.\u201d 27 min Lennon\u2019s dangerous cross is put over his own bar by Alexander-Arnold, who was in the six-yard box and facing his own goal. Van Dijk heads the corner clear. 27 min Liverpool are turning the screw, literally. 26 min \u201cJust for the record, Liverpool only need to win 34 of their remaining 35 fixtures,\u201d says Phil Grey. \u201cThey can afford to lose one of the games against Man City. So plenty of room for error between now and May...\u201d 25 min Alexander-Arnold waves a lovely pass across to Mane on the left side of the area. He moves back onto his right foot and hits a shot that deflects wide off a defender. 23 min Replays show that Pope got a slight but decisive touch when Salah hit the post early on. It was a brilliant save, especially as he was originally set for a curler towards the other corner. 21 min: Salah misses by a whisker! After a Burnley interception on the edge of the area, Henderson opened his body to steer an ingenious first-time pass over the defence and put Salah through on goal. His first touch was slightly heavy, which allowed Pope to charge from his line and try to smother a possible shot. In doing so he knocked the ball against Salah and it ricocheted a fraction wide of the far post. 19 min Jurgen Klopp is unhappy with a couple of Burnley fans. He complains to the fourth official and then gives a sarcastic thumbs up in their direction. I\u2019ve no idea what that\u2019s about. 18 min Burnley have already wasted a few set-pieces, which will irritate Sean Dyche. 17 min Not much happening at the moment. It\u2019s a frantic game, even by Premier League standards. 14 min Henderson\u2019s driven, angled cross is just too high for Mane in the centre; Lowton heads it clear. 11 min McNeil\u2019s inswinger is punched away unconvincingly by Adrian and headed further away by Fabinho. 10 min McNeil swerves around Alexander-Arnold, charges down the left and wins a corner off the recovering Alexander-Arnold. Van Dijk heads behind for another corner, this time on the right... 8 min That was a lovely effort from Salah, because he shaped to go across goal - as he usually does from that position - and then whipped a shot towards the near post that took Pope by surprise. 7 min Apart from that chance for Wood, this has been a very impressive start from Liverpool. There is so much speed and authority in their play. 5 min: Salah hits the post! This has been a cracking start. Mane played a short pass to the right of the area for Salah, who sidefooted a rising, first-time shot that beat Pope and clattered off the near post. 2 min: Good save from Adrian! Burnley almost stunned Liverpool after 80 seconds. Wood ran onto a long, straight pass from Tarkowski, turned inside van Dijk and tried to place the ball into the far corner with his left foot. Adrian plunged to his right to push it away. 1 min A flying start from Liverpool. Robertson\u2019s cross is cleared as Fabinho, who thrashes over the bar from 30 yards. 1 min Peep peep! Liverpool, in their black change strip, get the match under way. Burnley are in claret and blue. The players are ready for action. There\u2019s a bit of history between these sides, and I\u2019m not just talking about the 0-0 draw in December 1920, so this could be lively. Sheffield United have come from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 against Chelsea. That must feel especially sweet for the supporters who were at Stamford Bridge when United were dramatically relegated from the Premier League 25 years ago. Pre-match business Burnley (4-4-2) Pope; Lowton, Tarkowski, Mee, Pieters; Lennon, Cork, Westwood, McNeil; Barnes, Wood. Substitutes: Hart, Taylor, Long, Drinkwater, Hendrick, Rodriguez, Vydra. Liverpool (4-3-3) Adrian; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Kelleher, Gomez, Milner, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Shaqiri, Origi. Referee Chris Kavanagh. Hello. It really is very simple: if Liverpool win their remaining 35 league games, they will be champions for the first time since 1990. Seriously, though, if they want to finish above Manchester City they will probably need to win at least 30 matches, so games like this become close to a must-win - even at the end of August. Winning has become a happy habit for Liverpool. This is probably the most joyous time to be a Liverpool supporter since April 1988, and victory tonight would set a new club record of 13 consecutive league wins. With the scorching form of their front three, few would bet against them. Jurgen Klopp would quite like a first clean sheet of the season. But the main thing is that his team get three points. Kick off is at 5.30pm.",

In the German capital one protester waved a banner that read: \u201cThe last time this happened, Cromwell discontinued the custom of kings wearing their heads on their shoulders.\u201d</p> \n<p>The anger was particularly vocal in London. Outside Downing Street, demonstrators chanted \u201cShame on you\u201d. Momentum, which backs Jeremy Corbyn, told its 40,000 members to \u201coccupy bridges and blockade roads\u201d.

Those that turned up saw Gracia enjoy the sort of morale-boosting start his side so desperately needed in the wake of three straight defeats.

When Gracia\u2019s defensive quintet failed to cope with Emil Krafth\u2019s right-wing cross, bagatelle-style penalty area chaos ensued.

It could have been better but I\u2019ll accept it.\u201d Despite Newcastle\u2019s encouraging, if unexpected, win at Tottenham last Sunday, the crowd of 44,157 was the lowest for a Premier League fixture at St James\u2019 Park in seven years. Those that turned up saw Gracia enjoy the sort of morale-boosting start his side so desperately needed in the wake of three straight defeats. After two minutes Tom Cleverley\u2019s 20-yard shot was deflected into the path of Will Hughes, who delighted in beating Martin Dubravka from close range. Watford\u2019s celebrations had barely subsided before Gracia\u2019s new-look back five \u2013 \u201cI had to change something,\u201d he said \u2013 was stretched to the limit by an incisive left-wing cross from the impressive Christian Atsu. It really should have prefaced an equaliser for Miguel Almir\u00f3n, but the unmarked Paraguayan\u2019s first touch let him down, permitting the fast-reacting Ben Foster to step off his line and defuse the danger. It was the sort of fluffed chance that suggests that Almir\u00f3n\u2019s long wait for his first goal in a Newcastle shirt is exerting a psychologically debilitating effect. \u201cIt\u2019s just really bad luck,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cHe\u2019s a joy to work with and a really good footballer who just needs one goal to get up and running.\u201d As half-time beckoned, Fabian Sch\u00e4r advanced to show Almir\u00f3n precisely how to polish off an inviting opening. When Gracia\u2019s defensive quintet failed to cope with Emil Krafth\u2019s right-wing cross, bagatelle-style penalty area chaos ensued. The fallout concluded with Isaac Hayden knocking a loose ball down and Sch\u00e4r hooking beyond Foster. There seemed a strong suspicion that Hayden might have handled the ball but puzzlingly VAR was not deployed. The scrappiness of the preamble to that equaliser proved emblematic of a slapdash encounter with both sides struggling to retain possession, let alone create clear-cut chances. Foster had an opportunity to remind everyone of his enduring class when, early in the second half, he performed wonders to tip Hayden\u2019s rising shot over the bar. Perhaps sensing the game might be slipping from his team\u2019s grasp Gracia replaced Hughes and the unsettled Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 \u2013 who up against a half-fit, slightly one-paced Sean Longstaff did not look worth \u00a330m of Everton\u2019s money \u2013 with Isaac Success and Nathaniel Chalobah. Success might have won it for Watford after connecting with a superb cross from Cleverley, but Dubravka showed off outstanding reflexes to prove reassuringly equal to his header. When Success turned provider, cueing up Roberto Pereyra, Bruce\u2019s goalkeeper once again rescued his side \u201cIt\u2019s an important point, and a good point from a close and equal game,\u201d said Gracia. \u201cBut we still need a big victory.\u201d",

The sharp rise in the number of African football migrants has impoverished the local game as a spectacle and it has as yet to improve its finances, skills base or infrastructure. What money is made is retained by private academies and rapacious administrators.

Much of the transfer wealth generated is siphoned off by investors who have bought a \u201cshare\u201d of the player\u2019s value, criminal gangs who take a tithe from these transactions and corrupt club directors. Meanwhile, the clubs\u2019 debts to players and the tax authorities grow skyward.</p> <p>The continent has yet to transfer its sporting affections overseas, but the local spectacle is a shrunken and bleaker version of its old self.

Hungarian football is increasingly dominated by allies of the football-obsessed prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n; leading members of his party, Fidesz, run a majority of the top division\u2019s teams. So too, on their own turf, the royal houses of the Gulf, the presidents of Central Asia\u2019s republics, the billionaires of Mexico, China\u2019s giant corporations, Russia\u2019s oligarchs and India\u2019s industrialists. Everywhere, they have the money, connections and confidence to flout the rules and bend regulatory agencies, from Fifa and Uefa to local associations and leagues, to their will. African football, a central element of urban life on the continent for more than a century, has been marginalised culturally and reduced to penury by the arrival of satellite TV and the mass export of fans\u2019 affections and custom to European football in general, and the English Premier League in particular. The sharp rise in the number of African football migrants has impoverished the local game as a spectacle and it has as yet to improve its finances, skills base or infrastructure. What money is made is retained by private academies and rapacious administrators. The leading clubs, which could once draw huge numbers, serve as local and regional heralds and help sustain a rich culture of commentary, music and support, now play in front of pitiful crowds, culturally eclipsed by the lure of the European spectacle. Latin American football, many of whose clubs are almost as old as Bury, has also lost its best players to the rest of the world, leaving just the very young and very old on the pitch. Much of the transfer wealth generated is siphoned off by investors who have bought a \u201cshare\u201d of the player\u2019s value, criminal gangs who take a tithe from these transactions and corrupt club directors. Meanwhile, the clubs\u2019 debts to players and the tax authorities grow skyward. The continent has yet to transfer its sporting affections overseas, but the local spectacle is a shrunken and bleaker version of its old self. The sporting and judicial authorities are unable and unwilling to regulate football\u2019s enmeshment with money laundering and drug trafficking or deal with the pervasive violence and criminality of the game, let alone address its structural economic decline. It may appear that it is just football clubs that have been colonised, football associations that have been neutered and football fans who have been traduced, but global capitalism will undermine and ransack whatever cultural capital and communities it can commodify, until we choose to try to stop it. \u2022 David Goldblatt is the author of The Game of Our Lives.",

The so-called pact, though, is notably short of firm goals to reduce planet-heating emissions.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/climate-change/\" title=\"\">United Nations study</a>, the fashion industry is responsible for about 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions, 20% of all waste water, and consumes more energy than the airline and shipping industries combined.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/fashion/fashion-second-biggest-polluter-fake-news.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">figures are disputed </a>but the message is clear: fashion is a major polluter, and in an industry that depends on human desire for the new, questions hang over it like a dead weight.</p> <p>Few believe that the French fashion houses would act if it were not for growing consumer pressure. Kering has been publishing an <a href=\"https://kering-group.opendatasoft.com/pages/groupimpactepl18/\" title=\"\">\u201cenvironmental profit and loss\u201d</a> statement for its products since 2015; rival LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, as well as a stake in Stella McCartney \u2013 the label famous for banishing fur and leather \u2013 has yet to follow suit.</p> <p>But others have joined the rush to publish updated public sustainability reports. \u201cThe fashion industry was behind the curve on this, and it\u2019s playing catch-up to the way people feel,\u201d said Tim Blanks, a leading analyst at <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/\" title=\"\">Business of Fashion</a>. \u201cFashion brands are being held to account and developing an awareness and sense of consequence that it has been truly oblivious to.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/06/glen-luchford-best-photograph-amber-valletta-modelling-prada-sinking-boat\" title=\"\">supermodel Amber Valletta</a> says as much as she appreciated being told she looked good in this or that outfit, she often felt a disconnect between her job and the business. Around 15 years ago, she told the <em>Observer</em>, she \u201cstarted to connect the dots with the environment and cheap labour\u201d.</p> <p>Fashion, she claims, is an insular world with maybe a thousand people at the top of the industry: \u201cFashion is an insular world. There aren\u2019t that many people who hold the power. We live in a fashion bubble, but it trickles down in ways we\u2019re not really conscious of, to fast fashion and cheap labor. The reality is were affecting a lot of people and the planet.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fashion is responsible for 10% of greenhouse gas emissions and consumes more energy than airline and shipping combined</p> <footer> <cite>United Nations report</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Valletta recently shelved a fashion line on the basis that it would just be adding to the amount of stuff available without coming up with an environmentally innovative way of doing it. \u201cSomething went wrong. We lost meaning in what we were doing, and people lost meaning between what they need and what they buy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is, how are we going to do things the right way? It\u2019s like we have to change the way we make things, sell things and wear things. Everything really.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s currently planning a documentary looking at the underlying issues. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people at the top of the industry become the leaders of the change. In the past we fought for all sorts of causes. Now we have to fight for sustainability. Now we have to fight for the planet,\u201d she said.</p> <p>To be truly sustainable, brands may have to consider producing less at a time when consumers want more. According to a report by the <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/global-fashion-agenda\" title=\"\">Global Fashion Agenda</a>, any progress toward sustainability is actually decreasing \u2013 by as much as a third. Brands, it warned, have yet to solve the trade-off between growth and managing their environmental footprint.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da37b950c45402394699399cd03dca9082232844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da37b950c45402394699399cd03dca9082232844/910_0_2225_2781/800.jpg\" alt=\"A dump full of clothing waste\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To be sustainable, brands have to consider producing less when consumers want more.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohammed Anwarul Kabir Choudhury/Alamy Stock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With clothing production expected to hit 102 million tonnes a year by 2030, sustainability efforts need to accelerate to avoid even more strain being placed on the world\u2019s resources.</p> <p>Blanks, who helped chair this year\u2019s fashion sustainability summit in Copenhagen, said the issues are inclusivity and accountability: \u201cIf you are accountable, then you have a sense of cause and effect and it permeates everything you do. If you are inclusive, then you have to have respect for the environment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t underestimate the work that\u2019s being done at different companies,\u201d says Pinault, who is trying to get companies to sign up to eliminating single-use plastics and accelerate the industry\u2019s transition to renewable energy. \u201cThe problem is that we\u2019re all working in our little corners, so despite our efforts, everything we do is completely offset by the growth,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Kering itself, which has gone further than many to manage this equation, has seen its environmental scorecard (measured by air emissions, water pollution and land use) <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/can-kering-grow-and-be-sustainable-at-the-same-time\" title=\"\">getting worse</a>. </p> <p>The emerging argument, it seems, is to buy less but buy better on the principle that consumers will treasure and reuse those clothes and get off the seasonal treadmill. \u201cCouture is more sustainable in the sense that you\u2019re paying a lot of money for something that\u2019s produced to an incredibly high standard and there\u2019s no disposability written into it,\u201d Blanks said. </p> <p>The recent Valentino haute couture show, he added, was so spectacular that it received a 10-minute standing ovation from an audience where some were moved to tears of joy:</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the ethos of the heirloom \u2013 the highest end of the market is where you see this ethos realised in a very real way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d835d49862651cc57f6205492f50b84433f6494\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d835d49862651cc57f6205492f50b84433f6494/0_135_4134_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two female black models in strikingly colourful and luxurious outfits pass each other in a wood panelled room underneath a silver birch tree.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Valentino show that was part of Paris Fashion Week in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter White/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, haute couture is beyond the budget of most consumers, but the underlying principle \u2013 replace seasonal binge-shopping with clothes that express thoughtfulness and care \u2013 is the same. \u201cIt\u2019s much more fun because its about creativity and self-expression, and that\u2019s more challenging and rewarding,\u201d Blanks said.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t new to environmentally conscious millennials \u2013 many have adopted Earth-saving circular economy resellers like <a href=\"https://www.depop.com/\" title=\"\">DePop</a>, Farfetch\u2019s Second Life and the <a href=\"https://www.therealreal.com/\" title=\"\">RealReal</a> en masse. In a season when the New York fashion emporium <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/10/retail-crisis-shutters-coming-down-fifth-ave-new-york-manhattan\" title=\"\">Barneys went bankrupt</a>, the RealReal is valued at $2.39bn.</p> <p>\u201cOur focus on extending the life cycle of luxury and keeping pieces in circulation through resale offers a more sustainable way to shop luxury,\u201d said RealReal\u2019s Michael Groffenberger.</p> <p>The company acts as a middleman for secondhand haute couture between buyers and sellers \u2013 so-called \u201cauthenticated luxury consignment\u201d. Groffenberger notes that 64% of its millennial sellers (or consignors) say that environmental impact is the key reason for using the service.</p> <p>There are signs too, that the design community is beginning to wake up. Italy\u2019s Prada has said it wants to source all of its emblematic Nylon accessories from recycled materials, including ocean waste by the end of 2021. Giorgio Armani and Versace have both stopped the use of certain materials.</p> <p>\u201cWe have years of talk but now change is at the forefront,\u201d said Orsola de Castro of <a href=\"https://www.fashionrevolution.org/\" title=\"\">Fashion Revolution</a>, a group campaigning for greater industry transparency.

There is little hope of that happening, but in New York nine labels have so far refused to stage fashion shows at Hudson Yards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/13/new-york-hudson-yards-ultra-capitalist\" title=\"\">a vast development </a>on the city\u2019s westside in protest against real estate developer Stephen Ross, who recently held a re-election fundraiser at his Hamptons home for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism\" title=\"\">climate-change denier</a> Donald Trump . </p> <p>Fashion is <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmenvaud/1952/report-files/195204.htm\" title=\"\">worth \u00a332bn to the UK economy</a> and Britons buy more garments than any other country in Europe. They also, it would seem, throw a lot away.</p> <p>In protest at the 11 million items of clothing that end up in UK landfills each week, the model Stella Tennant and charity Oxfam recently launched their campaign against more than 50 million single-use items of clothing purchased by Britons this summer.</p> <p>For their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/27/why-stella-tennant-wants-you-to-stop-buying-new-clothes\" title=\"\">Second Hand September</a> campaign, the pair are asking consumers to abstain from buying new clothes for 30 days, and shop, ideally, at Oxfam to raise money for its programmes.</p> <p>As the <em>Financial Times</em> pointed out, the campaign comes \u201cslap at the beginning of the show season\u201d.</p> <p>Tennant points out that she\u2019s never been a seasonal shopper: \u201cThe things I loved 20 years ago I still love. The enemy is our insatiable desire for the new. We\u2019re human, and of course we love new things, and it\u2019s so exciting to see what these brilliant, creative designers have come up with.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of sustainability, we\u2019ve become very indulgent in how much stuff we buy and then how much stuff we discard.\u201d</p> <p>But that, she points out, is not a Valentino couture dress: \u201cThe skill and craftsmanship involved, and so many people making something so extraordinary \u2026 it\u2019s difficult to get the balance right, and I\u2019m not suggesting that should stop, but we need to be more thoughtful as consumers.\u201d</p> <p>That sentiment is echoed by designers. New York-based designer <a href=\"https://www.zeromariacornejo.com/\" title=\"\">Maria Cornejo</a>, who has won several awards for sustainability, is currently involved in a collaboration with carmaker Hyundai to \u201cupcycle\u201d excess leather from car seats in her designs.</p> <p>\u201cNobody is going to stop consuming, but it makes economic and environmental sense to reimagine materials that have had a prior life,\u201d she said. Unless you\u2019re buying a second-hand car, people only buy things because they desire them, not because it\u2019s politically correct, Cornejo reasons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"078c247ab41eb22ef2115096eb24a2cd47b24de9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/078c247ab41eb22ef2115096eb24a2cd47b24de9/0_301_4599_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two young women, not wearing makeup, wear coats that look much like fur coats but are green and striped yellow-green in front of red London Fashion week logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists from Extinction Rebellion wearing coats made of living grass protested outside London Fashion Week in February 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If some companies are jumping on the bandwagon and \u201cgreenwashing\u201d their products, that\u2019s better than taking no action at all, said Cornejo. \u201cIt\u2019s what has to happen because at least they\u2019re going in the right direction. It\u2019s the future. Everybody has to take some responsibility for what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>That message even seems to be filtering through to the red carpet of showbusiness, where the habit of only wearing clothes once for photographs first started before it filtered down to Instagram, fast-fashion and the mass-market.</p> <p>Fashion glossy US <em>Vogue</em> published a story titled <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/red-carpet-circular-economy\" title=\"\">Earth to A-Listers</a> calling on movie stars to bring the sustainability issue to the red carpet during award season following the UN\u2019s \u201cterrifying\u201d climate report.</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be powerful to see these same celebrities re-wearing gowns they\u2019ve worn in the past \u2013advocating against the throwaway culture that sees consumers toss away garments after a single use, like they do iced-coffee cups?\u201d asked writer Nicole Phelps.</p> <p>Model Michelle Hicks had her own take on red-carpet tyranny: \u201cIt became a rat race to wear the newest, coolest thing.

The so-called pact, though, is notably short of firm goals to reduce planet-heating emissions. According to a United Nations study, the fashion industry is responsible for about 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions, 20% of all waste water, and consumes more energy than the airline and shipping industries combined. The figures are disputed but the message is clear: fashion is a major polluter, and in an industry that depends on human desire for the new, questions hang over it like a dead weight. Few believe that the French fashion houses would act if it were not for growing consumer pressure. Kering has been publishing an \u201cenvironmental profit and loss\u201d statement for its products since 2015; rival LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, as well as a stake in Stella McCartney \u2013 the label famous for banishing fur and leather \u2013 has yet to follow suit. But others have joined the rush to publish updated public sustainability reports. \u201cThe fashion industry was behind the curve on this, and it\u2019s playing catch-up to the way people feel,\u201d said Tim Blanks, a leading analyst at Business of Fashion. \u201cFashion brands are being held to account and developing an awareness and sense of consequence that it has been truly oblivious to.\u201d The supermodel Amber Valletta says as much as she appreciated being told she looked good in this or that outfit, she often felt a disconnect between her job and the business. Around 15 years ago, she told the Observer, she \u201cstarted to connect the dots with the environment and cheap labour\u201d. Fashion, she claims, is an insular world with maybe a thousand people at the top of the industry: \u201cFashion is an insular world. There aren\u2019t that many people who hold the power. We live in a fashion bubble, but it trickles down in ways we\u2019re not really conscious of, to fast fashion and cheap labor. The reality is were affecting a lot of people and the planet.\u201d Valletta recently shelved a fashion line on the basis that it would just be adding to the amount of stuff available without coming up with an environmentally innovative way of doing it. \u201cSomething went wrong. We lost meaning in what we were doing, and people lost meaning between what they need and what they buy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is, how are we going to do things the right way? It\u2019s like we have to change the way we make things, sell things and wear things. Everything really.\u201d She\u2019s currently planning a documentary looking at the underlying issues. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people at the top of the industry become the leaders of the change. In the past we fought for all sorts of causes. Now we have to fight for sustainability. Now we have to fight for the planet,\u201d she said. To be truly sustainable, brands may have to consider producing less at a time when consumers want more. According to a report by the Global Fashion Agenda, any progress toward sustainability is actually decreasing \u2013 by as much as a third. Brands, it warned, have yet to solve the trade-off between growth and managing their environmental footprint. With clothing production expected to hit 102 million tonnes a year by 2030, sustainability efforts need to accelerate to avoid even more strain being placed on the world\u2019s resources. Blanks, who helped chair this year\u2019s fashion sustainability summit in Copenhagen, said the issues are inclusivity and accountability: \u201cIf you are accountable, then you have a sense of cause and effect and it permeates everything you do. If you are inclusive, then you have to have respect for the environment.\u201d \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t underestimate the work that\u2019s being done at different companies,\u201d says Pinault, who is trying to get companies to sign up to eliminating single-use plastics and accelerate the industry\u2019s transition to renewable energy. \u201cThe problem is that we\u2019re all working in our little corners, so despite our efforts, everything we do is completely offset by the growth,\u201d he added. Kering itself, which has gone further than many to manage this equation, has seen its environmental scorecard (measured by air emissions, water pollution and land use) getting worse. The emerging argument, it seems, is to buy less but buy better on the principle that consumers will treasure and reuse those clothes and get off the seasonal treadmill. \u201cCouture is more sustainable in the sense that you\u2019re paying a lot of money for something that\u2019s produced to an incredibly high standard and there\u2019s no disposability written into it,\u201d Blanks said. The recent Valentino haute couture show, he added, was so spectacular that it received a 10-minute standing ovation from an audience where some were moved to tears of joy: \u201cIt\u2019s the ethos of the heirloom \u2013 the highest end of the market is where you see this ethos realised in a very real way.\u201d Of course, haute couture is beyond the budget of most consumers, but the underlying principle \u2013 replace seasonal binge-shopping with clothes that express thoughtfulness and care \u2013 is the same. \u201cIt\u2019s much more fun because its about creativity and self-expression, and that\u2019s more challenging and rewarding,\u201d Blanks said. This isn\u2019t new to environmentally conscious millennials \u2013 many have adopted Earth-saving circular economy resellers like DePop, Farfetch\u2019s Second Life and the RealReal en masse. In a season when the New York fashion emporium Barneys went bankrupt, the RealReal is valued at $2.39bn. \u201cOur focus on extending the life cycle of luxury and keeping pieces in circulation through resale offers a more sustainable way to shop luxury,\u201d said RealReal\u2019s Michael Groffenberger. The company acts as a middleman for secondhand haute couture between buyers and sellers \u2013 so-called \u201cauthenticated luxury consignment\u201d. Groffenberger notes that 64% of its millennial sellers (or consignors) say that environmental impact is the key reason for using the service. There are signs too, that the design community is beginning to wake up. Italy\u2019s Prada has said it wants to source all of its emblematic Nylon accessories from recycled materials, including ocean waste by the end of 2021. Giorgio Armani and Versace have both stopped the use of certain materials. \u201cWe have years of talk but now change is at the forefront,\u201d said Orsola de Castro of Fashion Revolution, a group campaigning for greater industry transparency. De Castro credits the growing awareness to several events, including the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh in 2013, growing awareness of the environmental damage from microfibres, and the impact of British fashion house Burberry destroying \u00a330m of stock to guard against conterfeits (the French government floated a plan earlier this year to outlaw the widespread practice of destroying unsold clothes and luxury goods). \u201cThe negative impact of the fashion industry has reached its nadir and now consumers are beginning to ask the right questions,\u201d said De Castro. A reaction against the excessive consumerism of fashion is taking shape: recently the UK protest group Extinction Rebellion announced plans to shut down London fashion week, which starts on 13 September. \u201cIn recognition of the existential threat that faces us, we ask the British Fashion Council to be the leaders the world needs now and to cancel London fashion week,\u201d the group wrote in a letter to the British Fashion Council. There is little hope of that happening, but in New York nine labels have so far refused to stage fashion shows at Hudson Yards, a vast development on the city\u2019s westside in protest against real estate developer Stephen Ross, who recently held a re-election fundraiser at his Hamptons home for climate-change denier Donald Trump . Fashion is worth \u00a332bn to the UK economy and Britons buy more garments than any other country in Europe. They also, it would seem, throw a lot away. In protest at the 11 million items of clothing that end up in UK landfills each week, the model Stella Tennant and charity Oxfam recently launched their campaign against more than 50 million single-use items of clothing purchased by Britons this summer. For their Second Hand September campaign, the pair are asking consumers to abstain from buying new clothes for 30 days, and shop, ideally, at Oxfam to raise money for its programmes. As the Financial Times pointed out, the campaign comes \u201cslap at the beginning of the show season\u201d. Tennant points out that she\u2019s never been a seasonal shopper: \u201cThe things I loved 20 years ago I still love. The enemy is our insatiable desire for the new. We\u2019re human, and of course we love new things, and it\u2019s so exciting to see what these brilliant, creative designers have come up with. \u201cIn terms of sustainability, we\u2019ve become very indulgent in how much stuff we buy and then how much stuff we discard.\u201d But that, she points out, is not a Valentino couture dress: \u201cThe skill and craftsmanship involved, and so many people making something so extraordinary \u2026 it\u2019s difficult to get the balance right, and I\u2019m not suggesting that should stop, but we need to be more thoughtful as consumers.\u201d That sentiment is echoed by designers. New York-based designer Maria Cornejo, who has won several awards for sustainability, is currently involved in a collaboration with carmaker Hyundai to \u201cupcycle\u201d excess leather from car seats in her designs. \u201cNobody is going to stop consuming, but it makes economic and environmental sense to reimagine materials that have had a prior life,\u201d she said. Unless you\u2019re buying a second-hand car, people only buy things because they desire them, not because it\u2019s politically correct, Cornejo reasons. If some companies are jumping on the bandwagon and \u201cgreenwashing\u201d their products, that\u2019s better than taking no action at all, said Cornejo. \u201cIt\u2019s what has to happen because at least they\u2019re going in the right direction. It\u2019s the future. Everybody has to take some responsibility for what\u2019s going on.\u201d That message even seems to be filtering through to the red carpet of showbusiness, where the habit of only wearing clothes once for photographs first started before it filtered down to Instagram, fast-fashion and the mass-market. Fashion glossy US Vogue published a story titled Earth to A-Listers calling on movie stars to bring the sustainability issue to the red carpet during award season following the UN\u2019s \u201cterrifying\u201d climate report. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be powerful to see these same celebrities re-wearing gowns they\u2019ve worn in the past \u2013advocating against the throwaway culture that sees consumers toss away garments after a single use, like they do iced-coffee cups?\u201d asked writer Nicole Phelps. Model Michelle Hicks had her own take on red-carpet tyranny: \u201cIt became a rat race to wear the newest, coolest thing. You get photographed in it once and that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s bad.\u201d This week Hicks is going to fashion editor and stylist Carine Roitfeld\u2019s Harper\u2019s Bazaar party in her own 20-year-old Galliano dress. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning, so why not wear it again? Why not recycle?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The top court in Maryland ruled this week that a teen who sent a sexually explicit cellphone video of herself to two friends violated state child pornography law. The teen, referred to in court papers as SK, did not have to register as a sex offender but was ordered to undergo electronic monitoring and probation, which required drug tests and anger management classes as well as permission to leave the state. The decision, which upheld a decision from a lower Maryland appeals court, means other minors who engage in sexting could face similar legal repercussions. Amid spreading criticism, one expert told the Guardian it was \u201ca ridiculous reading of the statute\u201d concerned. The ruling, by a 6-1 majority among the judges on the Maryland court of appeals, said: \u201cWe refuse to read into the statute an exception for minors who distribute their own matter, and thus we believe SK\u2019s adjudication as delinquent \u2026 must be upheld.\u201d This 35-page decision stemmed from an incident at a high school several years ago. The student identified as SK was 16 at the time and therefore \u201clegally able to consent to engage in sexual conduct\u201d. According to the ruling, she and her two best friends swapped \u201csilly photos and videos\u201d in a cellphone-based group chat \u201cin an effort to \u2018one-up\u2019 each other\u201d. \u201cThe trio hung out together and trusted one another to keep their group messages private,\u201d the ruling said. The other group members were identified as AT, a 16-year-old female, and KS, a 17-year-old male. During the 2016-17 school year, SK sent them a \u201cone-minute video of herself performing [oral sex] on a male\u201d. After the trio fell out, the clip was shared with other students. AT testified that KS \u201cwould always write on the board, like, saying she\u2019s a slut or saying any type of thing\u201d and also urged AT to accompany him to the school resource officer, a member of the sheriff\u2019s department, to report the video.

The top court recognized that the issue was more complicated than in cases involving adults \u2013 but still ruled against SK. \u201cOn the one hand, there is no question that the state has an overwhelming interest in preventing the spread of child pornography and has been given broad authority to eradicate the production and distribution of child pornography,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cOn the other hand, SK, albeit unwisely, engaged in the same behavior as many of her peers.

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets across Britain and outside the gates of Downing Street in protest against Boris Johnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament. Crowds brandished banners pledging to \u201cdefend democracy\u201d, chanted \u201cstop the coup\u201d and waved EU flags in London in a bid to resist the parliament shutdown. Demonstrators massed at protests in dozens of locations around the country including Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham, Brighton, Swansea, Bristol and Liverpool. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell labelled Boris Johnson a \u201cdictator\u201d in a stinging attack as he addressed crowds outside Downing Street. He went on to attack the prime minister\u2019s move to suspend parliament, saying it had had \u201crightfully\u201d been called \u201ca very British coup\u201d, adding: \u201cWe have defeated dictators in the past in our history and we will defeat this dictator under Johnson.\u201d Speaking in Glasgow\u2019s George Square, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the crowd: \u201cI\u2019m proud to be here with all of you supporting that, to say to Boris Johnson no way, it\u2019s our parliament. No way do you take us out without a deal \u2013 we will stop you and give the people their rights and their say to determine their future.\u201d Following the rally outside Downing Street, dozens of protesters blocked traffic at Trafalgar Square by sitting in the road, while others marched towards Buckingham Palace. The Green party London assembly member Caroline Russell was among protesters blocking the road at Trafalgar Square arrested by police. The politician joined other demonstrators sitting in the road refusing to move while chanting: \u201cYou shut down the parliament, we shut down the streets.\u201d The Guardian captured footage of her being cheered as she was taken away in handcuffs by officers. Three demonstrators at the protest in the capital were arrested in total, Scotland Yard confirmed. In one of the biggest demonstrations the remain voting west country city has seen since the Brexit referendum, up to 5,000 people are thought to have marched in Bristol. Some waved homemade placards emblazoned with slogans like \u201cI have the right to representation\u201d, \u201cshamocracy\u201d and \u201cfuck Boris\u201d while the crowd chanted \u201cstop the coup\u201d and \u201cBoris, Boris, Boris \u2013 out, out, out\u201d. Many were old hands, who had been to lots of remain protests. But others were taking to the streets for the first time. Will Roberts, 39, who was with his wife and two children, had steered clear of protests until now, preferring to let the democratic process takes its course. \u201cI was disappointed with the result but this is worse than Brexit itself,\u201d he said. \u201cHand on heart, this is really frightening. If you know a bit of history, you\u2019ll know this is the thin end of the wedge.\u201d Donna Ferguson in Cambridge Martin Baxter, 67, is holding a \u201cno to racism, no to Boris Johnson\u201d banner. \u201cI think the situation is farcical in this country at the moment. The government we have is headed by a playboy.\u201d He hopes that the decision to prorogue parliament will be challenged and can be overturned, but is doubtful the situation will work out well for the political parties backing \u2018remain\u2019, either way. \u201cI think Mr Johnson doesn\u2019t care what the outcome is, as long as he can blame his political enemies when prorogation is overthrown. He can say: \u2018Oh well, if I\u2019d been able to prorogue parliament, then I would have got my deal through and I\u2019d have won. This is all their fault.\u2019 And then there will be a general election.\u201d \u201cYou do not preserve democracy by trashing it,\u201d said Barbara Wibbelmann, 64. \u201cProroguing parliament is no way to go about delivering Brexit.\u201d Originally from Germany, she has been living in the UK since 1984 and took out British citizenship shortly after the referendum. \u201cI can see why people don\u2019t like the EU, but we need to change it from within, not without.\u201d As for Boris Johnson, she says, what he is doing is \u201cvery wrong\u201d: \u201cIt flies in the face of democracy. People are being excluded from the decisions and their voices are not being heard.\u201d The Green party London assembly member Caroline Russell was among protesters blocking the road at Trafalgar Square arrested by police, it has emerged. The politician joined other demonstrators sitting in the road refusing to move while chanting: \u201cYou shut down the parliament, we shut down the streets.\u201d The Guardian captured footage of her being cheered as she was taken away in handcuffs by officers. Sian Berry, the Green Party co-leader, said: \u201cEarlier today, I was speaking at the main rally of the Defend Our Democracy protest. I said then that we were calmly determined not to have our rights chipped away. Protest, and direct action were needed, I said. \u201cI\u2019m proud that Caroline has been at the forefront, with others, of showing that determination. \u201cHistory tells us that all the rights we have we had to win. No one has ever handed them to us. \u201cCaroline and the others on the streets in London today were defending those hard-won rights that are now under attack from Boris Johnson. \u201cWe, the people, will come back on the streets again and again in the coming weeks of national crisis to defend our MPs and win our final say. \u201cWe will keep saying to Boris Johnson, to Jacob Rees-Mogg, to Dominic Raab \u2013 your actions do not represent us \u201cIf you abuse power, we the people will make sure you won\u2019t be in power much longer.\u201d Donna Ferguson in Cambridge Wearing a Bollocks to Brexit sticker, Brian Gould, 53, said he couldn\u2019t stay at home if there was any chance attending the rally would make a difference: \u201cI am afraid a no-deal Brexit may happen, and I don\u2019t want it to. I am here to stop Brexit.\u201d He runs his own business, importing German products into the UK and is worried about the consequence of Brexit on trade. \u201cI also have family living in Germany and friends living across the EU. I fear it will become harder to freely travel and visit them.\u201d He thinks the reason many people voted to leave is because British people don\u2019t feel European. \u201cWhen my friends in Europe speak of Europeans, they don\u2019t speak of \u2018them\u2019, they speak of \u2018us\u2019. Here in Britain, we don\u2019t do that. But whether or not we\u2019re in the EU, we\u2019re still Europeans. That\u2019s what a lot of people don\u2019t understand.\u201d Darren Jones, the Labour MP for Bristol North West, told protesters in the city that people should take to the streets to demonstrate against the prime minister and not allow \u201cdemocracy to die\u201d. He added: \u201cThank you to the thousands of you that have marched through the streets of Bristol and across the country to make it clear we will not stand down when our democracy is being shut down. \u201cWe are members of parliament and parliament is where we should be making your voice heard loud and clear, with the power of our vote and the ability to hold the government to account. \u201cIf Boris Johnson thinks he can turn Britain into an autocracy, he has got another think coming. \u201cIf the prime minister is able to close down parliament, we need to be able to bring it to the streets because we are your voice in parliament and our democracy is about all of us. \u201cWhat is clear from all of you today, and in towns and cities up and down the country, is that the British people will not let democracy die.\u201d After speaking at a demonstration in her Brighton constituency, the former Green party leader, Caroline Lucas, thanked those who came out to protest. She tweeted: More from Donna Ferguson in Cambridge British citizen Jasmina Makljenovic has spent an hour listening to speeches at the Stop the Coup rally in Cambridge, and now she is crying. \u201cThis is about my children and their future,\u201d she said. \u201cBoris Johnson is dangerous. This is not how democracy should work. There are dictators everywhere in the world. How on earth do people think they got into power? This is how it happened: slowly and gradually. We are like boiled frogs. Slowly we are being cooked and our freedoms are being taken away.\u201d Dozens of protesters are blocking traffic at Trafalgar Square by sitting in the road to demonstrate against the suspension of Parliament. Priyanka, a teacher from Berkshire who says her grandfather and great aunt were part of the salt march against colonial Britain in India led by Gandhi in 1930, joined others blocking the road to protest in the spirit of her family. The 33-year-old told the Guardian: \u201cWe want to make our voice heard. Regardless of what side of the fence everybody is on, whether it\u2019s anti-Brexit or pro-Brexit, I think today is actually about defending democracy and the very foundation of Parliament.\u201d Explaining why she felt compelled to sit in the road, she said: \u201cI think we were chanting just outside the steps of Downing Street, \u2018you shut down our Parliament, we\u2019ll shut down the streets.\u2019 So I think everyone has metaphorically taken it and now physically wants to be able to sit down and just make the point that actually something needs to be done. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that we have someone who just railroads a decision for 31st October and then is masking proroguing of Parliament with domestic policy.\u201d Referencing her family\u2019s history on the salt march with Gandhi in protest against colonial Britain, she added: \u201cMy Mum\u2019s finding quite ironic that I\u2019m actually marching for Britain.\u201d Couple Emma Beckingham and Charles Barker, both 23 and from Tooting, south London, sat in the road for an hour. Barker, clutching a sign reading \u201cremain, reform revolt, said Johnson was trying to \u201cblock the will of the people by stopping Parliament talking to each other\u201d. The bar worker added: \u201cIf MPs truly are the elected members of the people and the voice of the people, by stopping Parliament sitting you\u2019re stopping us from having a voice.\u201d Protesters in Wales Liberal Democrat Stephen Williams, a former MP for Bristol West, told protesters in the city: \u201cDemocracy is never a one-off event, whether it is a referendum or an election. \u201cAll he [Boris Johnson] cares about is being in power himself and being in power for his class of people so they can be the people who rule over us. We must stand up to that. \u201cWhat Johnson has done is wipe out most of the September calendar, wipe out most of the October calendar, leaving them with about four days to make the most important decision of any of our lifetimes and the most important decision that this 650 people will ever have to make. \u201cThat is worthy of North Korea, not Great Britain.\u201d From my colleague Libby Brooks in Glasgow Here are a selection of images from today\u2019s protests across the country Darren Jones, Labour MP for Bristol North West, told protesters in the city that people should take to the streets to demonstrate against the prime minister and not allow \u201cdemocracy to die\u201d. He added: \u201cThank-you to the thousands of you that have marched through the streets of Bristol and across the country to make it clear we will not stand down when our democracy is being shut down. \u201cWe are members of Parliament and Parliament is where we should be making your voice heard loud and clear, with the power of our vote and the ability to hold the government to account. \u201cIf Boris Johnson thinks he can turn Britain into an autocracy, he has got another think coming. \u201cIf the prime minister is able to close down Parliament, we need to be able to bring it to the streets because we are your voice in Parliament and our democracy is about all of us. \u201cWhat is clear from all of you today, and in towns and cities up and down the country, is that the British people will not let democracy die.\u201d Hundreds have gathered in George Square, central Glasgow, on a sunny but blustery afternoon, waving saltires, EU flags and handmade signs, to hear speeches from the SNP\u2019s Keith Brown, Scottish Labour\u2019s Paul Sweeney and Patrick Harvey from the Scottish Greens. SNP MP for Glasgow Central Alison Thewliss told the Guardian that her inbox had been full of messages protesting the prime minister\u2019s decision earlier this week to suspend parliament. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from people I\u2019ve never heard from before, and when I was chapping doors in the constituency this morning the message was the same. It\u2019s an egregious democratic outrage. You can\u2019t shut down parliament because you think it\u2019s not going to agree with you.\u201d She said that MPs were galvanised to fight prorogation this coming week, with more cross party collaboration since Johnson\u2019s move. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t believe it could happen until it actually did.\u201d The show this afternoon has been completely stolen by a little boy walking around with a hand written \u2018Boris is a jobbie\u2019 sign, which he has now turned into a chant. Speaking in Glasgow\u2019s George Square, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cI\u2019m proud to be here with all of you supporting that, to say to Boris Johnson no way, it\u2019s our Parliament. \u201cNo way do you take us out without a deal - we will stop you and give the people their rights and their say to determine their future.\u201d He said he is backing the protests all over the country, adding: \u201cDemonstrations are taking place everywhere because people are angered and outraged about what is happening. \u201cAngered that the government and a prime minister elected by 93,000 members of the Tory party is trying to hijack the needs, aims and aspirations of 65 million people. \u201cWell think on Boris, it\u2019s not on and we\u2019re not having it.\u201d Crowds have now moved on to Trafalgar Square where some demonstrators have been sat in the road blocking traffic for up to an hour. Scotland Yards says no arrests have been made. From the demo in Whitehall Chris McHugh, 33, who works for Labour MP Liz Twist and was demonstrating in Newcastle, said the protest is about \u201cprotecting democracy\u201d. He added: \u201cThe fact that thousands have taken to the streets of Newcastle today is so telling.\u201d From my colleague Dan Sabbagh in Whitehall Anti-Brexit campaign group Another Europe Is Possible has called for daily demonstrations. Alena Ivanova, from the group, said: \u201cToday\u2019s protests are the beginning of something huge - they have been inspiring, full of youth and diversity and energy.\u201d She added the daily protests must \u201cgrow into the millions\u201d in \u201cthe centre of every town in the country\u201d. From my colleague Simon Murphy at the demo in London Several hundred protesters braved the wet weather to gather in Birmingham\u2019s Victoria Square to hear speeches opposing the proroguing of Parliament. Labour\u2019s West Midlands MEP Neena Gill told the crowd: \u201cWhen I heard what was going on this week, I was actually gobsmacked. \u201cBoris may think he can shut down Parliament, but he cannot shut down the people.\u201d Hitting out at \u201cright-wing Brexiteers\u201d who she claimed aim to roll back hard-won rights and change the face of Britain, Gill added: \u201cNo-deal Brexit will be a complete catastrophe for this country and this region.\u201d Anti-Brexit demonstrators then marched along nearby New Street, Temple Street and Waterloo Street - with a handful of by-standers shouting pro-Brexit slogans, including a group of men chanting \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s barmy army\u201d. From the demo in Brighton Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell labelled Boris Johnson a \u201cdictator\u201d in a stinging attack as he addressed crowds outside Downing Street. Referencing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s absence from the rally \u2014 which earlier prompted cries of \u201cwhere\u2019s Jeremy?\u201d from protesters \u2014 McDonnell said the brought a \u201cmessage of solidarity\u201d from the Labour leader. He went on to attack the prime minister\u2019s move to suspend Parliament, saying it had had \u201crightfully\u201d been called \u201ca very British coup\u201d, adding: \u201cWe have defeated dictators in the past in our history and we will defeat this dictator under Johnson.\u201d Earlier, he said: \u201cThis is a fight to protect our democracy. We know what Johnson is up to, it\u2019s not very subtle, is it? He wants to close down our democracy to force through a no-deal Brexit.\u201d He added: \u201cHe also wants to try and convene a general election based upon this idea of his, he can frame it as people versus Parliament. Let\u2019s make it absolutely clear... Boris Johnson, this is not about Parliament versus the people, this is about you versus the people.\u201d Meanwhile, Shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler, wearing a \u201cdefend democracy\u201d sticker, geed up the crowd, chanting: \u201cWanna know what democracy looks like? This is what democracy looks like.\u201d After speaking at a demonstration in her Brighton constituency, former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas thanked those who came out to protest. \u201cThis is what democracy looks like,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThis is about more than Brexit. \u201cA democracy worthy of name isn\u2019t one where power is hoarded at the top. \u201cWe need a CitizensConvention to put people at heart of our politics, not feral elites.\u201d My colleague Dan Sabbagh is at the protest in central London Around 2000 protesters marched through Bristol city centre, bringing traffic to a standstill. People gathered at College Green and looped around the city, through the middle of the Broadmead shopping area and back to meet at Bristol Cenotaph. They shouted \u201cWhat do we want? Democracy! When do we want it? Now!\u201d, \u201cBoris Johnson, shame on you\u201d and \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, Boris Johnson\u2019s got to go\u201d. Footage of the demos across the UK Thousands of people have gathered in George Square in the centre of Glasgow at a People\u2019s Assembly Defend Democracy rally against the prorogation of Parliament and calling for a general election. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is expected to be among the speakers, ending his three-day visit to Scotland. From my colleague Simon Murphy at the protest in London.. Demonstrators have begun to march to the opposite side of Westminster Bridge, shouting: \u201cIf you shut down our Parliament, we shut down your bridge.\u201d NHS pharmacist Bridie Walton, 55, joined protesters in Exeter and condemned the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue Parliament, saying: \u201cNobody voted for a dictatorship.\u201d He added: \u201cThese are the actions of a man who is afraid his arguments will not stand scrutiny. \u201cBefore the Brexit vote I\u2019d never been to a demo in my life... [I am] watching a nastier world emerge.\u201d Protesters outside Downing Street Anti-Brexit activists gathered outside City Hall in Belfast to protest against the suspension of Parliament. Dozens of demonstrators chanted \u201cstop the coup\u201d while several activists addressed the crowd, condemning Boris Johnson\u2019s move. Susie Burlace, an English woman who has lived in Northern Ireland for six years, drew inspiration from Oscar Wilde with a placard stating: \u201cTo lose one government is a misfortune, to lose two looks like carelessness - or a coup.\u201d Brenda Gough, from west Belfast, was one of those who had promoted the event. \u201cMy concern is we are supposed to live in a democracy, whether you voted Remain or Leave,\u201d she said. Crowds gathered in Cathedral Gardens in Manchester swelled to several thousand. Among the speakers were the Labour MEP Julie Ward and broadcaster Paul Mason. Mason, a former BBC Newsnight and Channel 4 News correspondent, encouraged the crowd to chant \u201cStop the Coup\u201d. A short distance away, a small group of pro-Brexit supporters stood outside the National Football Museum, with a line of about 20 police officers watching on. Behind the officers, people jeered and shouted \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d, as one man sang \u201cOne Boris Johnson, there\u2019s only one Boris Johnson\u201d into a loudhailer. An estimated 1,200 people gathered in the Market Square in Cambridge and heard speeches from across the political parties, Unite, Unison and other unions. Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings were booed heavily like pantomime villains. One person shouted: \u201cOff with his head\u201d about Boris, referring to Charles I proroguing parliament. People were waving EU flags and anti-racist banners. Most popular message was unite to kick the Tories out and stay in the EU. Activists have been showing their solidarity overseas There are 32 planned protests taking place across the UK. Demonstrators gathered outside Oxford University\u2019s Balliol College, which was attended by Boris Johnson, to voice their displeasure about his handling of Brexit. Lesley McKie, who was at the college with her family, criticised the \u201cundemocratic actions of Boris Johnson and [senior adviser] Dominic Cummings\u201d. Denouncing the Prime Minister outside the institution where he established his \u201cpolitical profile\u201d sends \u201ca powerful message to Johnson and others leading this coup\u201d, she added. Simon Murphy has been speaking to people at the march. Here is his take: Protesters in Newcastle Shadow chancellor John McDonnell urged Labour MPs to join the nationwide protest, calling Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to close Parliament for up to five weeks an attempt \u201cto shut down democracy\u201d. \u201cAs elected Labour MPs across the country represent their constituents by joining in these protests, I urge other MPs to think of their constituents whose jobs and livelihoods will be put at risk in a no-deal Brexit. \u201cIf Boris Johnson wants a mandate, then he should call a general election and put it to the people.\u201d A crowd of more than 1,000 gathered at Cathedral Gardens in Manchester city centre. Among the speakers were Labour MEP Julie Ward and broadcaster Paul Mason. A short distance away, a small group of pro-Brexit supporters stood outside the National Football Museum, with a line of about 20 police officers watching on. Behind the officers, people jeered and shouted \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d, as one man sang \u201cOne Boris Johnson, there\u2019s only one Boris Johnson\u201d into a loudhailer. Protesters in Sheffield More than 1,000 people gathered in the centre of York to listen to speakers outside the famous Bettys tea rooms and The Ivy restaurant. Many of those in St Helen\u2019s Square were carrying banners as well as EU and Yorkshire flags and hats. Anti-Brexit campaign group Another Europe Is Possible has planned 32 StopTheCoup protests to take place in England, Scotland and Wales. And left-wing group Momentum is calling on its members to \u201coccupy bridges and blockade roads\u201d in conjunction with unrest on the streets. Other demonstrations will be held in cities including Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Swansea, Leeds, Belfast, Bristol and Aberdeen. There will also be rallies in Bodmin in Cornwall, and Clotheroe, Lancashire, as well as Amsterdam\u2019s Dam Square and the outside the British Embassy in Riga, Latvia. Labour cllr Jeremy Goslin at a demo Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott addressed the large crowd from a stage positioned near Number 10 and said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had sent his support for the demonstration. The Hackney North MP said \u201cWe are here outside 10 Downing Street trying to get Boris Johnson\u2019s attention, but let me tell you, before too long Jeremy Corbyn will be in 10 Downing Street and Boris will be gone. \u201cWe cannot allow Boris Johnson to shut down Parliament and to shut down the voice of ordinary British people.\u201d Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the numerous Brexit protests taking place across the country this weekend. Hundreds of protesters brought London\u2019s Whitehall to a standstill as they gathered outside the gates of Number 10. Demonstrators carrying placards and EU flags have been chanting \u201cBoris Johnson shame on you\u201d and \u201cTrump\u2019s puppet, shame on you\u201d, punctuated by the clanging of a bell, blowing of whistles and a drum.",

      "bodyText": "Championship Birmingham City added to Nathan Jones\u2019s misery with a comeback win over Stoke City at St Andrew\u2019s. The visitors looked like they were heading for their first victory of the season after Liam Lindsay opened the scoring just before the hour mark but two goals in the space of three minutes turned things around as Lukas Jutkiewicz levelled things, then 16-year-old substitute Jude Bellingham\u2019s deflected effort ensured Birmingham earned the points and Stoke stay bottom with a single point. Bellingham, at 16 years and 38 days broke Trevor Francis\u2019 49-year-old record to become the club\u2019s youngest ever scorer. Newly-promoted Charlton continued their unbeaten run this season with a 2-0 away victory at Reading, which moved them up to second. Loanee Jonathan Leko netted his first in the Football League, before Lyle Taylor converted his fifth goal of the season from the spot. Derby have still not won since the opening day of the season after conceding three first-half goals at Brentford. Bryan Mbeumo got the first, then Ollie Watkins added two more, his second coming after teammate Henrik Dalsgaard had blocked his original effort on the line. Five goals were shared between West Brom and Blackburn before the break at The Hawthorns. There were no goals in the second half, as the hosts won 3-2. Bradley Dack put Blackburn ahead after making the most of a mistake in the defence to slip home from inside the area. West Brom bounced back as Matt Phillips, Jake Livermore and Grady Diangana put the Baggies in control, with Bradley Johnson reducing the arrears on the stroke of half-time. Huddersfield are still winless after Luton came from a goal down to win 2-1, with James Collins cancelling out Terence Kolongo\u2019s opener, before Andrew Shinnie sealed victory with a curling effort from just outside the area. Striker Jordan Hugill scored twice for QPR at Sheffield Wednesday to earn a 2-1 victory. Steven Fletcher converted from the spot for the Owls, before Hugill struck twice from close range. League One Sunderland\u2019s season suffered its first blow at Peterborough, where they conceded two goals and two players were sent off. Marcus Maddison struck two goals, either side of a Josh Knight finish. First Luke O\u2019Nien saw red for an off-the-ball incident involving Posh\u2019s Ivan Toney, before Charlie Wyke picked up a second booking to get his marching orders.

The hosts battled back from two goals down before Callum O\u2019Hare found the back of the net in the 91st minute, but there was still time for Elliot Moore to equalise. League Two Ryan Bowman\u2019s fifth-minute strike was enough to secure Exeter\u2019s win over Mansfield and retain top spot. Forest Green goalkeeper Joe Wollacott had a day to forget, firstly gifting the opener to Newport\u2019s Padraig Amond, then getting himself sent off for bringing down Tristan Abrahams.

      "body": "<p>Leicester\u2019s fleet of English youngsters attracted a lot of attention, especially after Gareth Southgate summoned James Maddison and Ben Chilwell, but the acclaim here belonged mostly to a former England striker who still confounds defences.</p> <p>Jamie Vardy scored two goals and created one for Youri Tielemans, making Callum Wilson\u2019s smart effort for the visitors incidental.</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers can go into the international break encouraged by the performance of his team, who are unbeaten after their first four games, and grateful that Vardy has retired from national service. \u201cHe was unplayable today,\u201d said Rodgers of Leicester\u2019s trusty marksman. \u201cTo have that type of talisman up front is amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Bournemouth are anything but coy travellers and their outgoing nature here made them dangerous but also highly vulnerable. They carried a threat from the start but left themselves open to counterattacks \u2013 an approach that, while making for entertaining fare, seems reckless when Vardy is around.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/31/west-ham-norwich-premier-league-match-report\">S\u00e9bastien Haller on target again to guide West Ham to easy win over Norwich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When a venture forward by the visitors petered out in the 12th minute, Chilwell was quick to exploit the risk. He immediately sent a perfectly judged long pass over the top of the two Bournemouth players who had stayed back, with neither Chris Mepham or Steve Cook having the speed or anticipation to beat Vardy to the ball. The striker let it drop in front of him and then, spotting Aaron Ramsdale way off his line, struck it first time over him and into the net from 25 yards.</p> <p>\u201cWe had planned for Vardy,\u201d said Eddie Howe, dismayed. \u201cIt was one ball over the top \u2013 that\u2019s what he does. But we didn\u2019t cope well enough with it.\u201d</p> <p>Bournemouth hit back within three minutes. Callum Wilson made a clever run to give Caglar Soyuncu the slip and collect a through-ball from Ryan Fraser before clipping the ball past Kasper Schmeichel with impressive finesse.</p> <p>After that Leicester gained more control in midfield as Bournemouth\u2019s Philip Billing and Jefferson Lerma shrivelled up a little after earning yellow cards.</p> <p>Maddison was particularly inventive. In addition to being on the end of a cross by Marc Albrighton \u2013 which he headed just wide from 10 yards \u2013 he prompted his teammates with bold, precise passes. One of them led to Leicester\u2019s second goal.</p> <p>He picked out Vardy wide on the left. The striker\u2019s cross was blocked by Cook but when the ball bounced back to him, Vardy darted into the box and played a low pass across the face of goal. Tielemans bundled it in from close range via a post.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df9fc26aebbf6f4d60eaba7ea11600f966621c73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df9fc26aebbf6f4d60eaba7ea11600f966621c73/0_0_1993_1261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Youri Tielemans scores Leicester\u2019s second goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youri Tielemans scores Leicester\u2019s second goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Belgian made a mark in more contentious fashion in the 55th minute when the ball broke to him near halfway and he threw his foot over it, ending up stamping on Callum Wilson\u2019s ankle. It looked like a clumsy attempt to shield the ball but the result was a striker in real pain. A VAR review determined there was insufficient evidence to support a red card.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to watch it and see why,\u201d said Callum Wilson. \u201cHe went straight over the top and on my shin. He almost broke my ankle.\u201d</p> <p>Rodgers offered an explanation. \u201cHe is just trying to get his body between Wilson and the ball.

      "bodyText": "Leicester\u2019s fleet of English youngsters attracted a lot of attention, especially after Gareth Southgate summoned James Maddison and Ben Chilwell, but the acclaim here belonged mostly to a former England striker who still confounds defences. Jamie Vardy scored two goals and created one for Youri Tielemans, making Callum Wilson\u2019s smart effort for the visitors incidental. Brendan Rodgers can go into the international break encouraged by the performance of his team, who are unbeaten after their first four games, and grateful that Vardy has retired from national service. \u201cHe was unplayable today,\u201d said Rodgers of Leicester\u2019s trusty marksman. \u201cTo have that type of talisman up front is amazing.\u201d Bournemouth are anything but coy travellers and their outgoing nature here made them dangerous but also highly vulnerable. They carried a threat from the start but left themselves open to counterattacks \u2013 an approach that, while making for entertaining fare, seems reckless when Vardy is around. When a venture forward by the visitors petered out in the 12th minute, Chilwell was quick to exploit the risk. He immediately sent a perfectly judged long pass over the top of the two Bournemouth players who had stayed back, with neither Chris Mepham or Steve Cook having the speed or anticipation to beat Vardy to the ball. The striker let it drop in front of him and then, spotting Aaron Ramsdale way off his line, struck it first time over him and into the net from 25 yards. \u201cWe had planned for Vardy,\u201d said Eddie Howe, dismayed. \u201cIt was one ball over the top \u2013 that\u2019s what he does. But we didn\u2019t cope well enough with it.\u201d Bournemouth hit back within three minutes. Callum Wilson made a clever run to give Caglar Soyuncu the slip and collect a through-ball from Ryan Fraser before clipping the ball past Kasper Schmeichel with impressive finesse. After that Leicester gained more control in midfield as Bournemouth\u2019s Philip Billing and Jefferson Lerma shrivelled up a little after earning yellow cards. Maddison was particularly inventive. In addition to being on the end of a cross by Marc Albrighton \u2013 which he headed just wide from 10 yards \u2013 he prompted his teammates with bold, precise passes. One of them led to Leicester\u2019s second goal. He picked out Vardy wide on the left. The striker\u2019s cross was blocked by Cook but when the ball bounced back to him, Vardy darted into the box and played a low pass across the face of goal. Tielemans bundled it in from close range via a post. The Belgian made a mark in more contentious fashion in the 55th minute when the ball broke to him near halfway and he threw his foot over it, ending up stamping on Callum Wilson\u2019s ankle. It looked like a clumsy attempt to shield the ball but the result was a striker in real pain. A VAR review determined there was insufficient evidence to support a red card. \u201cI\u2019d like to watch it and see why,\u201d said Callum Wilson. \u201cHe went straight over the top and on my shin. He almost broke my ankle.\u201d Rodgers offered an explanation. \u201cHe is just trying to get his body between Wilson and the ball. If you review it and slow it down it looks a really bad tackle but it\u2019s one of those things which accidentally happens in the game.\u201d Callum Wilson would have welcomed a similarly lenient judgment in the 68th minute when he went down in the box after a challenge by Soyuncu and was booked after sarcastically applauding the referee\u2019s decision to award a free-kick to the defender. Soon Leicester struck again. The goal originated in a slick move involving Tielemans and Maddison; Bournemouth managed to interrupt it but did not clear the danger fast enough, allowing Maddison to nick the ball back off Mepham in the box. Tielemans helped it on to Vardy, who guided it into the corner of the goal from seven yards.",

Was, in short, his fellow Kiwi Joe Schmidt suddenly hamstrung between the past and the future?</p> <p>Well, for an hour at least, the age profile of this particular iteration of the Ireland team did not look too much of a problem.</p> <p>Rory Best was lingering on the bench, alongside Devin Toner, but otherwise the team were bursting with eager types intent indeed on presenting Schmidt with a variety of dilemmas.</p> <p>Where to start in reeling off the contenders - from David Kilcoyne at loosehead, a thundering menace in the loose, just as he was destructive at the scrum, through to the deadly men out wide, Jacob Stockdale and Andrew Conway.</p> <p>There was not a bus pass in sight. And between them, how the inside centre Bundee Aki strove to prove his commitment to the Ireland shirt and how Jack Carty marshalled them all with cuteness.</p> <p>Another senior citizen Gatland might have had in mind is Ireland\u2019s most precious asset, Johnny Sexton. The reliance on him and his half-back partner, Conor Murray, is Ireland\u2019s most obvious vulnerability but, if there lies a gulf between them and the generation behind, Carty\u2019s performance here was the most compelling evidence to date that there could be life after the old maestro.</p> <p>Wales have been wrestling with their own problems at fly-half, following the injury suffered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/12/blow-for-wales-as-gareth-anscombe-is-ruled-out-of-world-cup-due-to-injury-rugby-union\" title=\"\">Gareth Anscombe</a>, leaving Dan Biggar a little isolated himself as his country\u2019s linchpin.</p> <p>This was billed as an audition between two men to follow him up the steps to the plane and each of Wales\u2019s fly-halves here was given the half they were promised to stake their claims.</p> <p>Alas, poor Jarrod Evans\u2019s coincided with Ireland\u2019s ascendancy. He looked sharp in bursts but missed a simple penalty and had to watch as the visitors played their best rugby to build a 15-3 lead by half-time.</p> <p>So on strutted Rhys Patchell, who did much to ease Wales into something approaching a rhythm. As the scrum in front of him continued to crumble, to do so was quite a feat of adroitness, especially as that scrum, down to seven after Leon Brown carried the can for previous deficiencies, conceded the penalty try that moved Ireland 19 points clear just short of the hour.</p> <p>If they had held on to a lead of 16 points or more, Ireland would have taken a turn at number one in the world.</p> <p>Patchell, though, managed to guide Wales into the right areas, scoring the second of their two tries in the final quarter. In his mid-twenties, he is neither too old nor too young; he is happy at full-back and plays very much like Anscombe. His place on that plane is surely assured.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/24/ireland-england-twickenham-cian-healy-conor-murray-johnny-sexton\">Battered Ireland leave Twickenham nursing World Cup injury headaches | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, for all the irritations, Gatland took time to acknowledge more profound emotions.

He does it so gently but buried amid the jabs was the pointed suggestion that some of Ireland\u2019s key players are getting a bit old for this malarkey, that it could be time to introduce some fresh blood, that perhaps potentially it might be a little late to do that with the World Cup on the horizon. Was, in short, his fellow Kiwi Joe Schmidt suddenly hamstrung between the past and the future? Well, for an hour at least, the age profile of this particular iteration of the Ireland team did not look too much of a problem. Rory Best was lingering on the bench, alongside Devin Toner, but otherwise the team were bursting with eager types intent indeed on presenting Schmidt with a variety of dilemmas. Where to start in reeling off the contenders - from David Kilcoyne at loosehead, a thundering menace in the loose, just as he was destructive at the scrum, through to the deadly men out wide, Jacob Stockdale and Andrew Conway. There was not a bus pass in sight. And between them, how the inside centre Bundee Aki strove to prove his commitment to the Ireland shirt and how Jack Carty marshalled them all with cuteness. Another senior citizen Gatland might have had in mind is Ireland\u2019s most precious asset, Johnny Sexton. The reliance on him and his half-back partner, Conor Murray, is Ireland\u2019s most obvious vulnerability but, if there lies a gulf between them and the generation behind, Carty\u2019s performance here was the most compelling evidence to date that there could be life after the old maestro. Wales have been wrestling with their own problems at fly-half, following the injury suffered by Gareth Anscombe, leaving Dan Biggar a little isolated himself as his country\u2019s linchpin. This was billed as an audition between two men to follow him up the steps to the plane and each of Wales\u2019s fly-halves here was given the half they were promised to stake their claims. Alas, poor Jarrod Evans\u2019s coincided with Ireland\u2019s ascendancy. He looked sharp in bursts but missed a simple penalty and had to watch as the visitors played their best rugby to build a 15-3 lead by half-time. So on strutted Rhys Patchell, who did much to ease Wales into something approaching a rhythm. As the scrum in front of him continued to crumble, to do so was quite a feat of adroitness, especially as that scrum, down to seven after Leon Brown carried the can for previous deficiencies, conceded the penalty try that moved Ireland 19 points clear just short of the hour. If they had held on to a lead of 16 points or more, Ireland would have taken a turn at number one in the world. Patchell, though, managed to guide Wales into the right areas, scoring the second of their two tries in the final quarter. In his mid-twenties, he is neither too old nor too young; he is happy at full-back and plays very much like Anscombe. His place on that plane is surely assured. But, for all the irritations, Gatland took time to acknowledge more profound emotions. Whatever the result, a last home match at the end of one of the most successful eras in Welsh rugby history caught him unawares. \u201cI was a bit choked up a bit before the match,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd coming off the pitch I was quite emotional. I just want to say a big thank-you to everyone in Wales. They\u2019re a special people, very passionate, very kind. There\u2019s a really special place in my heart for Wales. I think we\u2019ve massively overachieved in the last 12 years. And we\u2019re not finished yet.\u201d",

Set in 1348, it\u2019s the story of three young people from very different backgrounds \u2013 an aristocrat, a farmer turned mercenary, and a proctor \u2013 making their way across England to British-held Calais against the backdrop of the hundred years war and the fast-approaching Black Death. Meek was previously the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s Moscow bureau chief. His third novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jul/09/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\" title=\"\">The People\u2019s Act of Love</a></em>, won the Ondaatje prize and was longlisted for the Booker. He lives in London with his wife and son.</p> <p><strong>The book is full of illuminating details about the past. How did you choose what to include and what to leave out? </strong><br>You have this problem of a very alien place and the huge weight of research. The more research you do, the more of a problem it becomes. You want to try to avoid a situation where the information that you\u2019ve learned is just regurgitated on the page. The ideal is that you read wide and deep but then almost try to forget it. So you get to the point where you\u2019re not entirely sure if the world that you\u2019ve got inside your head is something you\u2019ve made up or something that you remember. I had to believe it myself first, and in the end I did. I believed I was there in a strange kind of way.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a novel that doesn\u2019t attempt to mirror </strong><strong>medieval English, but rather to summon its linguistic atmosphere.

But I felt I couldn\u2019t do that because there\u2019s a whole range of words and constructions that were so overused in the 19th century during the medieval craze that swept art and letters then, that to put them in would just sound like pastiche and would be fatal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to portray the clergy not just as prophets of doom, but as thinkers and as practical people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>The Black Death was </strong><strong>indifferent to rank or sex and your novel has heroes and heroines from all classes. Indeed, the strongest figures are women. Was this intentional? Did you worry it might feel anachronistic given the lack of </strong><strong>agency most women endured at the time?</strong><br>There are more strong female characters in medieval literature than you might think. Clearly <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> and <em>The Decameron</em> are full of women characters, both narrators and figures in the stories. <em>The Romance of the Rose</em>, which is such an important element of the book, has all sorts of depictions of women, not only in terms of character and behaviour and outlook, but also personifications of moods and sentiments. So maybe I was changing the emphasis, but I, as the writer, just as you, the reader, am coming and looking at these characters with the eyes of the 21st century, but it\u2019s not like they weren\u2019t there to be looked at at the time.</p> <p><strong>From Defoe to Camus, we\u2019ve been taught to read plagues as metaphors</strong><strong>...</strong><br>I was quite consciously trying to make a comparison between the priesthood warning of the dangers of the plague and present-day scientists warning about climate change. But I wanted to portray the clergy not just as prophets of doom, but as thinkers and as practical people, who felt at this time that it was imperative that nobody died unconfessed. They felt they were acting to mitigate the consequences of the plague. In that mood of a mixture of sober awareness of the reality of climate change, which is denied or ignored by so many people, and the need for us all to do what we can to mitigate it, I think there is a parallel.</p> <p><strong>You recently published a collection of essays about Brexit, </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/11/dreams-of-leaving-and-remaning-james-meek-a-short-history-of-brexit-kevin-orourke-review\" title=\"\">Dreams of Leaving and Remaining</a></strong></em><strong>. It\u2019s hard to read a novel about three Brits travelling to Calais without thinking about our relationship with Europe \u2013 was this a conscious decision?</strong><br>Brexit is a continuing ache. I didn\u2019t set out to write a book about Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. However, having said that, it is set during the hundred years war, and it is both testimony to the history of hostility between this island and the continent, and to the history of equally close links between us. So in this ragtag group of people heading from the Cotswolds to France, you have some people who consider the French barely human but somebody else who sees the same country as the absolute pinnacle of culture, sophistication and excitement. And you have a Scotsman who\u2019s living there, in Avignon.

You recently published a collection of essays about Brexit, Dreams of Leaving and Remaining. It\u2019s hard to read a novel about three Brits travelling to Calais without thinking about our relationship with Europe \u2013 was this a conscious decision? Brexit is a continuing ache. I didn\u2019t set out to write a book about Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. However, having said that, it is set during the hundred years war, and it is both testimony to the history of hostility between this island and the continent, and to the history of equally close links between us. So in this ragtag group of people heading from the Cotswolds to France, you have some people who consider the French barely human but somebody else who sees the same country as the absolute pinnacle of culture, sophistication and excitement. And you have a Scotsman who\u2019s living there, in Avignon. As I was writing it, the character of Thomas, the priest, became something like a representation of the European. What books are at your bedside? Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s Flights, which I\u2019m halfway through. Reservoir 13 by Jon McGregor is next in line. Then a book in Russian by Pavel Sanaev called Bury Me Behind the Skirting Board. What was the last great book you read? It was The Conquest of Mexico by Hugh Thomas, an absolutely extraordinary book about an absolutely extraordinary series of events. It left me looking at the world in an entirely different way. How do you organise your books? By category, then alphabetically by author. What classic novel did you recently read for the first time? I\u2019ve just started reading Mrs Dalloway. Are you going to slam the phone down on me? What sort of reader were you as a child? I was the kind of person who would rather read than go out and play. I don\u2019t think my parents were too bothered about that. What book would you give to a 10-year-old? The Midnight Folk by John Masefield. Which author do you always come back to? I was looking at my books the other day and thinking how many I\u2019d like to read again. But Tolstoy. It has to be Tolstoy. \u2022 To Calais, in Ordinary Time by James Meek is published by Canongate (\u00a318.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Who knows what Trump really intends? Probably nobody, including Trump.

The US has backed Riyadh in the teeth of an international outcry. Yet with the Saudis and the UAE now at odds, and with the Houthis unbowed, this <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/uae-carries-out-air-strikes-against-yemen-government-forces-to-support-separatists-idUSKCN1VJ17F\" title=\"\">chaotic offshoot of Trump\u2019s proxy war with Iran</a> is further exacerbating regional instability.</p> <p>Of all the blunders Trump has made pursuing his Iran obsession, his failure to intervene to help stop Syria\u2019s civil war is surely the most puzzling. It has led to a situation where, as of today, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-syria-security-northwest/syrian-army-makes-new-gains-as-russia-brings-reinforcements-rebels-residents-idUKKCN1VJ2QZ\" title=\"\">civilians in Idlib city are trapped by murderous fire</a> in a dreadful echo of previous sieges. It seems he does not care about that. But US inaction has also enabled the Assad regime\u2019s ally, Iran, to establish a permanent military presence on Israel\u2019s doorstep.</p> <p>If Trump is such a great and trusted friend of Israel, why has he tolerated this threatening development? And why is he essentially leaving Israel to cope with it on its own? These are questions that Israelis should consider when Netanyahu \u2013 aka \u201cMr Maximum Pressure\u201d and cheerleader of the Donald J Trump fan club \u2013 comes asking for their vote.</p>",

What is clear, however, is that the regional security situation is worsening, with Netanyahu\u2019s Israel in danger of becoming the fall guy in the wider, undeclared American \u201cshadow war\u201d with Iran \u2013 a war Trump is loth to fight himself. Trump\u2019s Iran policy, swinging indiscriminately like a wrecking ball through the most brittle regions of the Middle East, is taking a toll on Iraq, too, whose government is being pulled both ways. The US is pressing for an end to Iraqi gas and electricity purchases from Iran and closer ties between Baghdad and Washington\u2019s Arab allies. But Tehran continues to exercise considerable influence among the Shia-majority population, not least since the US invasion in 2003. Recent attacks on Iran-linked militias and US installations in Iraq were \u201cclear warnings of how badly escalation between the US and Iran could destabilise Iraq and the region as a whole\u201d, the independent International Crisis Group said last week. \u201cWashington\u2019s \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 campaign could wind up placing as much stress \u2013 and inflicting as much harm \u2013 on its nominal ally Iraq as it does on Iran.\u201d Unsuccessful attempts by Adel Abdul-Mahdi, Iraq\u2019s prime minister, to rein in pro-Iran militias belonging to the Popular Mobilisation Forces \u2013 as demanded by the US \u2013 have underlined Iraq\u2019s fragile state. Leaders of the militias, which led the fight to expel Islamic State (Isis) from northern Iraq earlier this summer, refuse to accept Baghdad\u2019s authority while their political allies are demanding the withdrawal of 5,000 remaining US troops. Speaking last week, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN envoy to Iraq, said US-Iran rivalry threatened to deal a \u201chuge blow\u201d to efforts to rebuild the country following the defeat of Isis. Her warning came amid reports that Isis jihadists are making a comeback in northern and western Iraq and Syria \u2013 notwithstanding Trump\u2019s claim to have eliminated the group, and perhaps in part because the US has, on his orders, reduced its military presence there. If Isis\u2019s undercover resurgence is taking place in the shadow of Trump\u2019s Iran fixation, so too is the disaster in Yemen, where an inept Saudi-led campaign to defeat Iran-backed Houthi rebels has triggered a humanitarian emergency. The US has backed Riyadh in the teeth of an international outcry. Yet with the Saudis and the UAE now at odds, and with the Houthis unbowed, this chaotic offshoot of Trump\u2019s proxy war with Iran is further exacerbating regional instability. Of all the blunders Trump has made pursuing his Iran obsession, his failure to intervene to help stop Syria\u2019s civil war is surely the most puzzling. It has led to a situation where, as of today, civilians in Idlib city are trapped by murderous fire in a dreadful echo of previous sieges. It seems he does not care about that. But US inaction has also enabled the Assad regime\u2019s ally, Iran, to establish a permanent military presence on Israel\u2019s doorstep. If Trump is such a great and trusted friend of Israel, why has he tolerated this threatening development? And why is he essentially leaving Israel to cope with it on its own? These are questions that Israelis should consider when Netanyahu \u2013 aka \u201cMr Maximum Pressure\u201d and cheerleader of the Donald J Trump fan club \u2013 comes asking for their vote.",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m off now, thanks for reading. See you next time! Burnley v Liverpool has just kicked off. You can follow that with Rob Smyth right here. 1-0 down at half-time, Barcelona are now 2-1 in front. 16-year-old Fati came on at the break and scored Barca\u2019s first goal, making him the third youngest scorer ever in La Liga. Arthur got Barca\u2019s second goal. Louise Taylor on Newcastle 1-1 Watford. Dominic Fifield on Crystal Palace\u2019s controversial win over Aston Villa. Paul MacInnes on West Ham 2-0 Norwich. Jacob Steinberg on Chelsea 2-2 Sheffield United. Stuart James on a crazy finish at Elland Road. Leeds 0-1 Swansea. Peter McMurry, with an email: \u201cFWIW I thought Grealish was fouled outside the box, powered through the fouls until he got into the box, and then did one of those drag-your-foot-while-going-to-ground-in-the-hope-you-can-draw-a-PK things. Not a dive but not a PK either, IMHO.\u201d I think it\u2019s definitely a foul. My understanding is that the reason that they didn\u2019t go to VAR is because the referee blew his whistle. The phase ended. If Kevin Friend has let the play continue, they could have gone back and reviewed it after Lansbury had put the ball into the net. Paul Doyle on Leicester\u2019s 3-1 win over Bournemouth Here\u2019s Nick Ames on Manchester City\u2019s win over Brighton. Confirmation that Swansea did hold on for that precious 1-0 win at Leeds United. The Welsh side are now top of the Championship. Gosh, I\u2019m looking at that disallowed Aston Villa goal again. Grealish was fouled \u2013 twice! \u2013 as he drove to the top of the Crystal Palace, and legitimately hit the turf after a trip. The ball fell to Henri Lansbury, on as a late substitute, and the former Arsenal man slotted his finish across Guaita into the far corner. But Kevin Friend pulled the play back for a Grealish dive! Why on earth didn\u2019t they go to VAR?! This is now up to date from the 3pm fixtures. Sergio Aguero is now your new overlord. A hugely controversial win for Roy Hodgson\u2019s side. Probably a fair result. Watford win their first point of the season, but they remain bottom of the Premier League. Grealish is tripped on the edge of the area, the play goes on and Villa score but Kevin Friend blows his whistle! He says that Grealish dived (he clearly did not), and blows for a Palace free-kick! Villa will go mad! And they have every right to go mad! (Very Barry Davies voice). A brilliant, dominant performance from the Hammers, who should have scored four. Easy. Kurt Zouma has his head in his hands. Swansea have taken a 90th-minute lead at Leeds! Wayne Routledge has somehow squeezed his effort over the line, and the Welsh side will go top of the Championship table with a win here. Leeds will slip to third. Massive! Half-time at Osasuna, and Barcelona are still trailing 1-0. These were the scenes before the match. Luis Enrique\u2019s daughter, Xana died on Thursday after a five-month battle with bone cancer. Sheffield United have pulled in back from two goals behind! They were dead-and-buried at half-time but fully deserve this second goal. Callum Robinson, who has been a real nuisance this second half, did well out wide, crossed for Mousset, and his glancing header flicked off Zouma and found the far corner! Watford are finishing the stronger at St James\u2019 Park: Dubravka making a good save to deny Pereyra. Stoke were on course for their first win of the season but two Birmingham City goals in four minutes means that they are behind. What a story here: Jude Bellingham, who is JUST 16 YEARS OLD and only came on because of an injury, has scored Birmingham\u2019s latest goal to make it 2-1. A heavily deflected effort. Twenty seconds after coming on as a substitute, Bernardo Silva latches onto a nice pass from Sergio Aguero and slots it calmly into the corner. Boring. Palace have finally broken 10-man Villa\u2019s resistance. Villa have been defending for their lives but couldn\u2019t stop Jordan Ayew as he cut in from the left unopposed and curled a shot around Tom Heaton, who maybe could have done a little better. Sunderland: 3-0 down at Peterborough, and they are down to NINE men. I\u2019d say that one is done. And Leicester take advantage of the fact that they still have 11 men! And it is Tielemans that is the provider for Vardy! I\u2019m sure Eddie Howe will have something to say about that post-match. Vardy makes no mistake after some good work from James Maddison. A shocking challenge from Tielemans on Callum Wilson. The Belgian completely misses the ball and ends up with his studs half-way up Wilson\u2019s leg. The Bournemouth man\u2019s ankle actually crumples with the challenge, but Tielemans doesn\u2019t even get a yellow card! That\u2019s outrageous! Some stat, this. Still 1-1 between Newcastle and Watford at St James\u2019 Park. Newcastle are probably the better side, but Foster has made some good saves from Isaac Hayden. Atsu also had a chance to tap in at the back post, but just couldn\u2019t reach it. Think Gazza against Germany in \u201896. Two quick goals for QPR at Sheffield Wednesday, both scored by Jordan Hugill, who is on loan from West Ham. Five goals in four games for the former Preston striker. Hint of an offside there, but the linesman kept his flag down. Bottom of the Championship, Stoke City are leading at Birmingham City. Liam Lindsay scores from a set piece to ease the pressure on manager Nathan Jones. Birmingham keeper Lee Camp \u2013 who arguably has the worst lid in the Football League - should really have done a lot better under a high ball. I said pre-match that I was excited about West Ham\u2019s attack, and they are proving a real hand-ful. Norwich have looked really shaky since Zimmermann went off with injury and they fail to deal with a ball into the box. The ball bounces to Yarmolenko\u2019s lovely left foot and the Ukrainian volleys it past Tim Krul. Ag\u00fcero has his second! Dunk gave the Argentinian way too much room, and Aguero bent a beautiful shot into the top corner. Game over. It\u2019s been a poor game at Selhurst Park, but advantage to Palace, after Villa\u2019s Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet is penalised for a second yellow, catching Zaha with a clumsy tackle. Barcelona are losing at Osasuna! Brandon dances around Lenglet crosses to the back post and Roberto Torres is there to head the Pamplona side in front! Fresh from battering Burnley in midweek, Sunderland are 2-0 down away at Peterborough. Josh Knight with the second goal for Posh, there. Sheffield United are back in it! That\u2019s Callum Robinson\u2019s first Premier League goal, who looks relieved to have found the net after his earlier miss. Enda Stevens does some great work on the left, nutmegging Azpilicueta, and pulling the ball back to Robinson, who makes no mistake in passing the ball past Kepa Arrizabalaga. Peeeeeeeeep! And we\u2019re underway again. With those two goals against Sheffield United, Tammy Abraham is now on four goals for the season, and you can check the top scorers in each of the top five European leagues right here. On the continent, Bayern are now 3-1 up, courtesy of a goal from Ivan Perisic on his full debut. An absolutely towering header at the back post for the Croatian, who is so good in the air. Barcelona, meanwhile, are just about to kick off away at Osasuna. Real Madrid play Villarreal tomorrow night, while Atl\u00e9tico face Eibar at home. West Ham 1-0 Norwich Manchester City 2-0 Brighton Crystal Palace 0-0 Aston Villa Newcastle 1-1 Watford Leicester 2-1 Bournemouth Chelsea 2-0 Sheffield United Abraham gets his second! The England man capitalises on a horrible defensive mix-up and sticks it in the bottom left corner. Good news for City: Ag\u00fcero is still very good at shooting, and finds the corner with a clever finish. Bad news for City: Laporte has been replaced by Fernandinho. Laporte looked in a bad way, it looked like a knee injury. I would be very surprised to see him playing for France next week. It\u2019s not the prettiest goal, but Newcastle are level! Sch\u00e4r is first to a loose ball and he hooks a finish into the net with his left foot. Leicester retake the lead. This time it\u2019s Vardy that provides the assist, with Tielemans getting a faint touch to take the ball past Ramsdale. Chance for Sheffield United! Chris Basham, one of the overlapping centre backs that Chris Wilder\u2019s side are becoming famous for, sends a brilliant cross over for Callum Robinson, who nods wide when he should score! It remains 1-0 to Chelsea. Brighton have had 51% possession at the Etihad. Looks like a nasty injury for Man City\u2019s Aymeric Laporte, who is being carried off the field. Eeeeesh, and just when he had got he call-up for France! On the stroke of half-time at the Allianz Arena, David Alaba has bent a 25-yard free-kick over the wall and into the top corner. Muller didn\u2019t move in the Mainz goal. Bayern were 1-0 down, but go into the break 2-1 up. At the Etihad, David Silva has missed a sitter from three yards. Brighton have showed signs of life, though, since falling behind to an second minute Kevin De Bruyne strike. North of the border, Sherwin Seedorf (a distant relative of Clarence), has given Motherwell the lead against Hibs. 1-0 there. He\u2019s done it again. The Frenchman\u2019s third goal in two games. West Ham have been poor but they take the lead, with Masuaku ghosting past his man on the left, squaring to Haller, who has an easy finish. A tap-in, really. \u201cThey\u2019re the best ones,\u201d cries Tony Cottee. And he would know. Elsewhere in the Championship, West Brom have equalised against Blackburn through Matt Phillips, while Sheffield Wednesday are 1-0 up against QPR. Steven Fletcher from the spot. Meanwhile, Lampard\u2019s old side Derby are sinking without trace at Brentford. Two-nil down, with Ollie Watkins scoring and new signing Bryan Mbeumo getting his first goal for the London club. Lampard\u2019s young side lead! Pulisic cuts across his marker, Henderson can only parry the ball out, and Abraham is there to volley Chelsea into the lead. Not a bad quality that, to be in the right place. His third goal of the season. This is a lovely finish from Callum Wilson, who once again gets an assist from Ryan Fraser. The pair made Premier League history last season, combined for 12 goals in the top flight, surpassing Alan Shearer and Mike Newell\u2019s 11 combined goals set in 1995/96 \u2013 that is the most ever in a 38-game season. Wilson had a lot to do here, but dinked the ball over Schmeichel, and the ball just trickled in off the post. Ipswich Town, top of League One, are flying against Shrewsbury. Two-nil up with James Norwood continuing his excellent form, scoring from the penalty spot. This is textbook Vardy. Bournemouth are playing a ridiculously high line. Vardy breaks the offside trip, races onto the ball and lobs the ball over Ramsdale into the empty net. You can make that 11 goals since March. In the Championship, Blackburn are 1-0 up at West Brom thanks to Bradley Dack, while Leeds are pushing hard for an early goal against Swansea. Bayern are level. It\u2019s 1-1 at home to Mainz. Pavard has a habit of these volleys \u2026 \u201cBeing more 90\u2019s than a hosepipe ban, I\u2019m enthused to see some early Premiership fixtures repeated today,\u201d emails Benjamin Oates. \u201cPalace v Villa, Chelsea v Sheff Utd, West Ham v Norwich. Proper fixtures\u201d I wonder what Mark Stein is up to these days. Will Hughes pounces on a rebound and calmly sidefoots Watford in front! What a start for the side bottom of the table! Forget that part about City\u2019s midfield having an off day. David Silva gets onto a through ball, drives to the byline, lays it back to De Bruyne, who smashes it into the net. Ominous for Brighton. Peeeeeeeeeep! We\u2019re underway! A first Premier League start for Chelsea\u2019s Fikayo Tomori, who was player of the year at Derby under Frank Lampard. Very exciting for the 21-year-old, he comes in for Christensen, who drops to the bench. Some strange absentees. Jack Wilshere, fresh from his good performance in midweek, does not make the 18-man West Ham squad. Hope you\u2019re reading, Jack! For Watford, there is no Jos\u00e9 Holebas or \u00c9tienne Capoue for their trip to Newcastle. Five minutes to go then. Don\u2019t be shy in getting in touch, you can email me michael.butler@theguardian.com or tweet @michaelbutler18. Predictions, thoughts, complaints all welcome. Jenny Price chimes in with an email. \u201cYou have to have sympathy for Brighton \u2013 or maybe respect for their canoes in turning up at all \u2013 when you look at the City team sheet and realise that every player on the bench would be a nailed-on starter in most of the top six clubs.\u201d It\u2019s a daunting task today. And yep, if David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, and Raheem Sterling all have an off day, there\u2019s Bernardo Silva, and Phil Foden to come on, with Fernandinho - who has defined the role of DMC in this country for the past few years \u2013 to sure things up if they need to. Bit of a weird one with Joao Cancelo. He had an excellent season with Juventus last season, but looks like he\u2019s playing second fiddle to Kyle Walker. Not sure why he swapped playing in that Juventus side for the City bench. And why did Juventus let him go? They are probably weakest in that position now. Mattia De Sciglio is a steady player, but probably not going to win you the Champions League. Hmmm. Bayern Munich, who have already dropped points this season, have just fallen 1-0 behind at home to Mainz. Jean-Paul Bo\u00ebtius with the goal on what is a first Bayern start for both Philippe Coutinho and Ivan Perisic. Ten minutes gone there, so plenty of time for a recovery. Dortmund, by the way, have an early evening match against Union Berlin. Some absolutely textbook pre-match snaps here. A few things to take from those teams: That West Ham attack looks naughty. Interesting that Watford have not started record signing Isma\u00efla Sarr, particularly as he looked so good in midweek in the Carabao Cup. Watford, remember, are rock bottom of the Premier League with nil points. Pukkkkkkkiiiiiiiiiiiiii. \u201cAfternoon Michael,\u201d emails Simon McMahon. \u201cI think all football fans wherever they are and whichever team they support will have empathised with the points made in your preamble, and in particular the reference to Bury FC. But of course, as devastating as it must be for the Bury fans, the show must go on. Good luck to them, whatever happens next. \u201cTo business now, and in Scotland, Dundee United maintained their 100% start to the league season as they thrashed Dundee 6-2 at Tannadice last night to go seven points clear of their city \u2018rivals\u2019 at the top of the Scottish Championship after just four games, and five ahead of second placed Inverness. A sell out crowd of over 14,000 were there to witness it. Today, Arbroath host Dunfermline and it\u2019s Partick v Ayr and Queen of the South v Alloa. In the Scottish Premiership two Glasgow teams play tomorrow, whilst today sees Aberdeen welcome Ross County, Hibs travel to Motherwell and also Hearts v Hamilton, Livingston v St. Mirren and St. Johnstone v Kilmarnock. In Scottish League One, it\u2019s Airdrie v Falkirk and East Fife v Raith, and in Scottish League Two, leaders Cove Rangers play third placed Queens Park, and Cowdenbeath face Brechin.\u201d A comprehensive fitba update there, and I\u2019ll bring those scores to you later on.

For fans going to the game, it\u2019s often the walk to the stadium, the pre-match pint or meal, the waving and nodding to familiar faces, that makes the day. For those at home, the fact that these games aren\u2019t on telly creates obsessive habits. Perhaps you are refreshing this MBM, or checking on your accumulator, or huddling around the telly at 4.45pm for the classifieds. Football, in that sense, is reliable. For those abroad, lucky enough to beam these games into their living rooms or local bars, strange communities start to emerge. The Doncaster Rovers Supporters\u2019 group \u2013 Hong Kong faction. The Coventry City Sky Blues in San Francisco. The same five old pensioners in Nairobi rocking Newcastle shirts. That\u2019s what football does, it makes you feel part of something, even something at the other end of the country, or on the other side of the world. Let\u2019s celebrate that, but also remember the Bury fans today, who can\u2019t cheer on their team this particular Saturday, as they have done for years. Team news is coming right up, and while I\u2019ll be mainly covering a busy Premier League slate, I\u2019ll do my best to chip in with some goals from around the Football League and further afield.",

      "body": "<p>The sting in this game\u2019s tail left Aston Villa numb. A contest their depleted number appeared to have surrendered sparked back into life deep into stoppage time, with Jack Grealish scuttling away, via a touch from Wilfried Zaha, to tear into the penalty area at a backtracking Gary Cahill. The visitors\u2019 captain was stumbling but still shifted the ball to his right as he fell beyond the crumpling defender, his eyes darting to Henri Lansbury at his side as the substitute converted a low shot into the far corner.</p> <p>Villa\u2019s delight would be choked almost immediately. Kevin Friend, subsequently described as \u201ccard happy\u201d by a simmering Dean Smith after booking four visiting players in the first half and sending off Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet for a second offence, had blown his whistle for simulation as the substitute connected with his effort. Grealish never appealed for a penalty, for all that two of his teammates did call for the award, but the perceived dive still provoked another flash of yellow and a sense of outrage among players and travelling fans alike.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/31/southampton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester United held by 10-man Southampton thanks to Vestergaard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their protests would extend well after the final whistle, with ugly clashes with stewards and police at the front of the Arthur Wait stand.</p> <p>\u201cHe got a nudge from Zaha in the back and, as he offloads it, Cahill comes into the tackle as well,\u201d said Smith. \u201cSimulation? No chance. Someone just put to me that his reputation may precede him. Well, he was the most fouled played in the Championship last season for a reason. He may be in this league as well.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re Jack Grealish, you\u2019d be raging. He\u2019s made a great run, laid it off for Henri Lansbury to score, and now he\u2019s had his integrity questioned not only by the officials here, but in Stockley Park as well. It was a perfectly good goal for me.\u201d</p> <p>The Premier League later confirmed the VAR, Andrew Madley, has reviewed the \u201cpotential penalty situation\u201d, but had been unable to check the \u201cgoal\u201d \u201cbecause the whistle went before the ball went into the net\u201d.</p> <p>It was no consolation for Villa that an equaliser would have been out of context in a one-sided game. A bright start aside, Smith said their display had lacked intensity until that frantic finale and once their number had been depleted they had rather clung to the contest until prised apart by a player they once counted their own.</p> <p>Jordan Ayew remains an unlikely hero. The Ghanaian had spent 18 months at Villa, with whom he was relegated back in 2016, and had cost \u00a32.5m when secured from Swansea over the summer having spent last season on loan in these parts. Yet, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/24/manchester-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">scored at Old Trafford the previous weekend</a>, he has already scored twice as many league goals this season as last to ensure Crystal Palace, a team who had failed to win a home game until December last season, have broken their duck at the second attempt this time.</p> <p>His winner summed up his industrious style.

      "bodyText": "The sting in this game\u2019s tail left Aston Villa numb. A contest their depleted number appeared to have surrendered sparked back into life deep into stoppage time, with Jack Grealish scuttling away, via a touch from Wilfried Zaha, to tear into the penalty area at a backtracking Gary Cahill. The visitors\u2019 captain was stumbling but still shifted the ball to his right as he fell beyond the crumpling defender, his eyes darting to Henri Lansbury at his side as the substitute converted a low shot into the far corner. Villa\u2019s delight would be choked almost immediately. Kevin Friend, subsequently described as \u201ccard happy\u201d by a simmering Dean Smith after booking four visiting players in the first half and sending off Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet for a second offence, had blown his whistle for simulation as the substitute connected with his effort. Grealish never appealed for a penalty, for all that two of his teammates did call for the award, but the perceived dive still provoked another flash of yellow and a sense of outrage among players and travelling fans alike. Their protests would extend well after the final whistle, with ugly clashes with stewards and police at the front of the Arthur Wait stand. \u201cHe got a nudge from Zaha in the back and, as he offloads it, Cahill comes into the tackle as well,\u201d said Smith. \u201cSimulation? No chance. Someone just put to me that his reputation may precede him. Well, he was the most fouled played in the Championship last season for a reason. He may be in this league as well. \u201cIf you\u2019re Jack Grealish, you\u2019d be raging. He\u2019s made a great run, laid it off for Henri Lansbury to score, and now he\u2019s had his integrity questioned not only by the officials here, but in Stockley Park as well. It was a perfectly good goal for me.\u201d The Premier League later confirmed the VAR, Andrew Madley, has reviewed the \u201cpotential penalty situation\u201d, but had been unable to check the \u201cgoal\u201d \u201cbecause the whistle went before the ball went into the net\u201d. It was no consolation for Villa that an equaliser would have been out of context in a one-sided game. A bright start aside, Smith said their display had lacked intensity until that frantic finale and once their number had been depleted they had rather clung to the contest until prised apart by a player they once counted their own. Jordan Ayew remains an unlikely hero. The Ghanaian had spent 18 months at Villa, with whom he was relegated back in 2016, and had cost \u00a32.5m when secured from Swansea over the summer having spent last season on loan in these parts. Yet, having scored at Old Trafford the previous weekend, he has already scored twice as many league goals this season as last to ensure Crystal Palace, a team who had failed to win a home game until December last season, have broken their duck at the second attempt this time. His winner summed up his industrious style. Villa, further blunted in Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet\u2019s absence, had actually been mustering a rare attack which broke down as Vicente Guaita collected. The goalkeeper\u2019s throw was collected by Luka Milivojevi\u0107 and the ball ushered on down the flank by Jeffrey Schlupp for the Ghanaian to collect. He benefited from some fortune to retain possession as he twisted back inside and between Tyrone Mings and Grealish, but the finish was converted accurately across Tom Heaton and into the far corner. Roy Hodgson, frustrated at his side\u2019s familiar profligacy, had considered introducing Christian Benteke for Ayew moments before the goal. \u201cThe amount of work Jordan puts in for us, not just attacking but defending too... when he puts icing on that cake by scoring last week and then this, then it\u2019s happy days,\u201d said the Palace manager. \u201cThey\u2019re happy days he deserves. He didn\u2019t get as many opportunities as he would have liked last year and found himself on the bench quite often but never once did he stop working hard in training. For players like that, when their moment arrives, you feel really happy for them.\u201d",

I was clear with the players that this can be either 3-0 or a potential 2-2 on our hands. We only had ourselves to look at.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another argument was that Lampard had to look at himself after tweaking his midfield when Chelsea were clinging on to their 2-1 lead in the dying stages, replacing the Croatian international Mateo Kovacic with Billy Gilmour, an 18-year-old debutant. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bold,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cKova was blatantly tired. Other people can make what they want of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lampard also referenced Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban when he explained why Gilmour was on the bench, a reminder that this squad remains light in too many positions. They badly missed the energy of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 when the tide turned and were unable to respond when Chris Wilder\u2019s determined side eventually started to play with more fire in midfield.</p> \n<p>Not that Lampard was convinced by his team\u2019s performance in the first half. Chelsea laboured in the final third at times and the home fans could have been forgiven if they were pining for Eden Hazard\u2019s creative genius before Abraham, who had scored twice at Norwich City the previous weekend, punctured the tension in the 19th minute. The 21-year-old forward\u2019s opener owed much to the unlikely hustle of Christian Pulisic, though Wilder was annoyed with Dean Henderson\u2019s part in the goal.</p> \n<p>The United goalkeeper was far too slow to collect a downward header from Abraham and allowed himself to be buffeted by Pulisic. Abraham fired the loose ball into the net and Henderson received a verbal rollocking from Wilder in the dressing room at the interval.</p> \n<p>United\u2019s manager was just as irritated when Robinson headed wide from close range in the 39th minute. It looked easier to score and the Blades received a lesson in ruthlessness four minutes later.</p> \n<p>Their defending was poor again, Jack O\u2019Connell and John Egan getting in each other\u2019s way as they tried to deal with Jorginho\u2019s lofted pass. Abraham stole in to become the first Englishman to score at least two goals in consecutive Premier League appearances for Chelsea since Lampard in January 2010.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f0dc4ddac43365680a346debf1073004851a638\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f0dc4ddac43365680a346debf1073004851a638/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea\u2019s Tammy Abraham celebrates scoring his second goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea\u2019s Tammy Abraham celebrates scoring his second goal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Kington/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was turning into a stroll for Chelsea but United halved the deficit a minute after the restart.

We only had ourselves to look at.\u201d Another argument was that Lampard had to look at himself after tweaking his midfield when Chelsea were clinging on to their 2-1 lead in the dying stages, replacing the Croatian international Mateo Kovacic with Billy Gilmour, an 18-year-old debutant. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bold,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cKova was blatantly tired. Other people can make what they want of that.\u201d Lampard also referenced Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban when he explained why Gilmour was on the bench, a reminder that this squad remains light in too many positions. They badly missed the energy of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 when the tide turned and were unable to respond when Chris Wilder\u2019s determined side eventually started to play with more fire in midfield. Not that Lampard was convinced by his team\u2019s performance in the first half. Chelsea laboured in the final third at times and the home fans could have been forgiven if they were pining for Eden Hazard\u2019s creative genius before Abraham, who had scored twice at Norwich City the previous weekend, punctured the tension in the 19th minute. The 21-year-old forward\u2019s opener owed much to the unlikely hustle of Christian Pulisic, though Wilder was annoyed with Dean Henderson\u2019s part in the goal. The United goalkeeper was far too slow to collect a downward header from Abraham and allowed himself to be buffeted by Pulisic. Abraham fired the loose ball into the net and Henderson received a verbal rollocking from Wilder in the dressing room at the interval. United\u2019s manager was just as irritated when Robinson headed wide from close range in the 39th minute. It looked easier to score and the Blades received a lesson in ruthlessness four minutes later. Their defending was poor again, Jack O\u2019Connell and John Egan getting in each other\u2019s way as they tried to deal with Jorginho\u2019s lofted pass. Abraham stole in to become the first Englishman to score at least two goals in consecutive Premier League appearances for Chelsea since Lampard in January 2010. It was turning into a stroll for Chelsea but United halved the deficit a minute after the restart. Enda Stevens tore past C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, who has been out of sorts for a while, and the left wing-back\u2019s cross found Robinson, whose clipped finish left the goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, rooted to the spot. Henderson kept the game alive with a magnificent save from Abraham and Chelsea, who gave a debut to Fikayo Tomori in central defence, were already fearing the worst when Robinson, twisting away from Azpilicueta, whipped in a teasing cross that Zouma turned in under pressure from the French forward Lys Mousset. It may not be much consolation for Chelsea\u2019s nervous supporters but at least Frankieball is turning out to be anything but dull.",

L\u00f3pez!\u201d shook the arena, not because the crowd adored Medvedev\u2019s opponent but because they wanted to bury him. Even his missed first serves were soundtracked by whooping cheers. As the atmosphere intensified, the Russian put his head down and did not say a word. He won and then exploded: \u201cI want all of you to know, when you go to sleep at night, I won because of you,\u201d he said gleefully, drunk on the boos.

      "body": "<p>It should have been a normal family chat in late midsummer in Berlin. Kerstin Falkner, 22, and her new partner, Andreas, eight years her elder, were sitting in the back of Metzer Eck, the corner bar run by her mother, B\u00e4rbel, discussing where they might go for their holidays.</p> <p>Only one thing was out of key: instead of joining in, B\u00e4rbel was sitting in the corner next to me, trying to keep back her tears. She simultaneously feared and hoped for the same thing: that they might not be coming home.</p> <p>It was the summer of malcontents on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall. The first half of 1989 had been marked by change to communist regimes in eastern Europe. In Poland, after a decade of rebellion quashed by martial law, the government and the free trade union Solidarity had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/feb/06/polish-round-table-talks-1989\" title=\"\">forged an agreement</a> to differ, and then to agree. There had been a partly free election in June, after which Solidarity members entered parliament. In Hungary \u201cgoulash communism\u201d, de facto toleration of private enterprise \u2013 which made for a more liberal and affluent economy than its communist neighbours \u2013 was rapidly leading to a similar attitude in politics.</p> <p>The exception was East Germany, where change was unthinkable. It was an old joke that the former Soviet occupation zone, despite its new name, was neither German, nor democratic, nor a republic. In reality it was clearly not democratic, but it was arguably a republic. And definitely German. Its leader, Erich Honecker, far from being an east German, came from the most westerly part of prewar Germany, the Saarland, heavily industrial and dominated by the Communist party to which he belonged. Arrested by the Gestapo, he had spent 10 years in a Berlin prison, breaking free only as the Red Army entered the city.</p> <p>Honecker had been instrumental in building the \u201cantifascist protection wall\u201d, which he boasted could last 100 years. When I first moved to East Berlin to work for Reuters in 1981, I picked up a 20th anniversary poster with a Honecker lookalike, sporting his trademark heavy-framed glasses, among \u201cheroic\u201d army construction workers.</p> <p>East Germany\u2019s leader was a true believer.

That day, 19 August, showed how fast it was changing. East Germans like Kerstin and Andreas, if they could go abroad on holiday at all, were limited to other Soviet satellite countries, and needed a visa for those. The most popular was Hungary, with its gentle climate and the warm, shallow Lake Balaton. But that summer, with the GDR increasingly feeling like a prison camp, many of the thousands that came were not going home, in such numbers that the Hungarians couldn\u2019t fulfil their agreement to forcibly repatriate them.</p> <p>As soon as the token stretch of border opened, hundreds of East German \u201cholidaymakers\u201d turned up out of nowhere to pile through into Austria. An overnight phenomenon was created. The border was closed again, but with fortifications gradually being dismantled, local people gave them advice on where best to sneak through.</p> <p>The East Germans kept coming, and Budapest would not now send them back.

Hungary had become East Germany\u2019s unlocked back door. But East Berlin moved fast to have the front door slammed: Hungary\u2019s northern border to Czechoslovakia closed. Unable to get farther, the crowds now simply piled into the West Germany embassy in Prague, soon to become massively overcrowded.</p> <p>Back in Berlin, Kerstin and Andreas had planned to go to Hungary, but assumed that border too would soon be closed. So they decided on the \u201csafe\u201d option: Poland, for which they had visas, and a friend to stay with. Surely, they thought, if a deal was done in Prague, the same would eventually be done in Warsaw?

Her brother Siggy had spent six years in Bautzen top-security prison for attempting <em>Republikflucht</em> (\u201cflight from the republic\u201d) before being expelled to the west. Honecker\u2019s policy was to punish failed escapees then ironically grant them what they wanted, if only to be rid of \u201cantisocial nuisances\u201d. Karin had taken the alternative option: to apply officially for permission to leave. With clouds of unrest on the domestic front gathering, the regime was getting rid of as many potential troublemakers as possible. Her request had been granted: in two weeks she would be able to cross the wall to join Siggy in West Berlin.</p> <p>Little did any of us know that in six weeks the wall itself would be gone. The day after my meeting with Karin, G\u00fcnther, a friend of mine from Leipzig, (he had introduced me years before to the Auersbachkeller, the 15th-century beer cellar described in Goethe\u2019s Faust) rang to say that the regular peace gathering he attended in the city\u2019s historic Nikolaikirche, where he was a flautist, had taken on a political angle. More than that, the several hundred who regularly met there had grown to more than a thousand and were now demanding greater political freedom along the lines of what had happened in Poland and Hungary, and also that the right to travel be restored and expanded. To make their point they had decided to do the unthinkable: march on the streets the way West German students did in protest against American missile deployment. He was going to join them. Did I want to come along? I did.</p> <p>The following Monday, after a beer in the Auersbach we joined several thousand marching from the Nikolaikirche around Leipzig\u2019s inner ring road, carrying makeshift banners under the slogan \u201c<em>Wir sind das Volk</em>\u201d (\u201cWe are the people\u201d). I still have one: black paint daubed on a scrap of red cloth.</p> <p>The wheel had begun to roll.

      "bodyText": "It should have been a normal family chat in late midsummer in Berlin. Kerstin Falkner, 22, and her new partner, Andreas, eight years her elder, were sitting in the back of Metzer Eck, the corner bar run by her mother, B\u00e4rbel, discussing where they might go for their holidays. Only one thing was out of key: instead of joining in, B\u00e4rbel was sitting in the corner next to me, trying to keep back her tears. She simultaneously feared and hoped for the same thing: that they might not be coming home. It was the summer of malcontents on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall. The first half of 1989 had been marked by change to communist regimes in eastern Europe. In Poland, after a decade of rebellion quashed by martial law, the government and the free trade union Solidarity had forged an agreement to differ, and then to agree. There had been a partly free election in June, after which Solidarity members entered parliament. In Hungary \u201cgoulash communism\u201d, de facto toleration of private enterprise \u2013 which made for a more liberal and affluent economy than its communist neighbours \u2013 was rapidly leading to a similar attitude in politics. The exception was East Germany, where change was unthinkable. It was an old joke that the former Soviet occupation zone, despite its new name, was neither German, nor democratic, nor a republic. In reality it was clearly not democratic, but it was arguably a republic. And definitely German. Its leader, Erich Honecker, far from being an east German, came from the most westerly part of prewar Germany, the Saarland, heavily industrial and dominated by the Communist party to which he belonged. Arrested by the Gestapo, he had spent 10 years in a Berlin prison, breaking free only as the Red Army entered the city. Honecker had been instrumental in building the \u201cantifascist protection wall\u201d, which he boasted could last 100 years. When I first moved to East Berlin to work for Reuters in 1981, I picked up a 20th anniversary poster with a Honecker lookalike, sporting his trademark heavy-framed glasses, among \u201cheroic\u201d army construction workers. East Germany\u2019s leader was a true believer. The new thinking in Moscow, with Mikhail Gorbachev turning a blind eye to events in Poland and Hungary, and visiting West Germany to rapturous reception, made Honecker all the more determined to enforce rigid communism and put down any protest. Honecker felt still further threatened when Gorbachev, asked discreetly by West German media about the possibility of eventual unification, said obliquely: \u201cTime alone will bring change.\u201d Nobody envisaged how little time it would take. The rest of the world was still looking to the past. That April I had joined hordes of journalists in the little Austrian border town of Braunau am Inn, expecting to see far-right gangs turn up at the house where Adolf Hitler was born, to commemorate his 100th birthday. In the event, there were more of us than them. In May 1989 I visited Otto Habsburg, heir to the abolished Austro-Hungarian monarchy, in his home outside Munich. A fervent promoter of European unity, he planned to encourage a \u201cpicnic\u201d on the border between Austria and Hungary, a token of East-West reconciliation, during which the closed frontier would be thrown open for several hours, a portent of the changing politics. That day, 19 August, showed how fast it was changing. East Germans like Kerstin and Andreas, if they could go abroad on holiday at all, were limited to other Soviet satellite countries, and needed a visa for those. The most popular was Hungary, with its gentle climate and the warm, shallow Lake Balaton.

      "body": "<p>How rank are the rankings? There was a moment here when Ireland were in position to replace Wales at the top of them one week after they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/england-ireland-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\" title=\"\">conceded 57 points at Twickenham </a>and in a year when they had been well <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/ireland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">beaten at home by England </a>and in Cardiff. They were 22-3 up, having been overwhelmingly dominant against a team made up of second- and third-choice players before, as if embarrassed by the prospect, they eased off to the point where they were hanging on for a victory.</p> <p>It gave both head coaches something to salvage from an afternoon when the immediate future counted for appreciably more than the present. Ireland\u2019s Joe Schmidt saw a response from Twickenham with his defence sharper, admittedly without the spectre of a Manu Tuilagi to contend with, and the set-pieces supreme. Ireland squeezed Wales for an hour, forcing mistakes and turning them into points, but even with Bundee Aki providing drive in midfield they struggled to create off their own ball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/31/warren-gatland-wales-ireland-joe-schmidt-rugby-world-cup\">Ireland show no signs of ageing to dampen Gatland\u2019s home farewell | Michael Aylwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wales\u2019s Warren Gatland, who made 14 changes from the team that had defeated England two weeks ago to allow him to work out the final places in his World Cup squad which will be announced on Sunday on Sunday, saw his side lose their place at the top of the rankings in his final match in charge of the side here but the final 20 minutes showed the difference he has made in his 12 years.</p> <p>Wales used to be known for their shallowness, gold-plated rather than full metal. Here, 22-3 down after 62 minutes having been routed up front to the point where their prop Leon Brown was sent to the sin-bin after a fourth team penalty conceded in the set-piece in almost as many minutes and squeezed in the lineout, they rallied to score two tries and were pressing for an improbable victory in the final minutes.</p> <p>Wales have developed character under Gatland, a refusal to accept defeat and a willingness to give everything. It was never likely to be enough against an Ireland team which, though Schmidt had made 11 changes from Twickenham, contained some established combinations and was primed with a strong bench with experienced players such as Rory Best probably feeling they had something to prove.</p> <p>Wales had the bulk of possession in the first half but trailed 15-3 at the break, having conceded two tries when they had been in possession. First Aled Davies was forced to kick hurriedly after Ryan Elias had been brought down a long way behind the gainline. Will Addison caught the ball running from deep and, after the prop Dave Kilcoyne evaded three tacklers, Jack Carty freed Andrew Conway with an inside pass.</p> <p>The wing weaved his way into Wales\u2019s 22, leaving four tacklers clutching nothing, before freeing Jacob Stockdale who had an unopposed 15-metre run to the line. He had rather more distance to cover 10 minutes later when Aaron Shingler flicked a pass out of the back of his hand to James Davies as Wales moved right on halfway.</p> <p>It was a manoeuvre Wales used not to indulge in but they now have a licence to skill. \u201cIt was not the pass but the execution,\u201d said Gatland. As the ball bounced behind Davies, Stockdale swooped, hacked ahead and accepted a kind bounce to beat Hallam Amos to the line.</p> <p>Jarrod Evans had earlier equalised Carty\u2019s opening penalty but it was otherwise a game to forget for the fly-half who was, in effect, in a shoot-out with the replacement Rhys Patchell for the role of Dan Biggar\u2019s deputy in Japan. He had few opportunities to launch his back division in his 40 minutes on the field with Wales overrun up front and at the breakdown but, as his desperation increased, he missed a penalty to touch one minute before Ireland\u2019s second try and was wide with a 25-metre kick at goal.</p> <p>Patchell seized his moment in the final 18 minutes. He had had no chance before that with Wales conceding a penalty try shortly after Brown had been sent to the sin-bin, but his ability to give his side width yielded a try for the debutant Owen Lane, a bustling wing who was used to supply the thrust Wales lacked in midfield, scoring on the right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Patchell dummied over five minutes from the end, the home side scented the opportunity to extend their run of 11 consecutive victories in a sequence that stretched back 21 months. They fell short but the tear Gatland had in his eye when he took to the field at the end was a rare nod to sentiment.</p> <p>\u201cIt is emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have overachieved in the last 12 years and we are not finished yet. When we are mentally and physically right, we can give any team in the world a run. I believe we will go a long way in the World Cup.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "How rank are the rankings? There was a moment here when Ireland were in position to replace Wales at the top of them one week after they had conceded 57 points at Twickenham and in a year when they had been well beaten at home by England and in Cardiff. They were 22-3 up, having been overwhelmingly dominant against a team made up of second- and third-choice players before, as if embarrassed by the prospect, they eased off to the point where they were hanging on for a victory. It gave both head coaches something to salvage from an afternoon when the immediate future counted for appreciably more than the present. Ireland\u2019s Joe Schmidt saw a response from Twickenham with his defence sharper, admittedly without the spectre of a Manu Tuilagi to contend with, and the set-pieces supreme. Ireland squeezed Wales for an hour, forcing mistakes and turning them into points, but even with Bundee Aki providing drive in midfield they struggled to create off their own ball. Wales\u2019s Warren Gatland, who made 14 changes from the team that had defeated England two weeks ago to allow him to work out the final places in his World Cup squad which will be announced on Sunday on Sunday, saw his side lose their place at the top of the rankings in his final match in charge of the side here but the final 20 minutes showed the difference he has made in his 12 years. Wales used to be known for their shallowness, gold-plated rather than full metal. Here, 22-3 down after 62 minutes having been routed up front to the point where their prop Leon Brown was sent to the sin-bin after a fourth team penalty conceded in the set-piece in almost as many minutes and squeezed in the lineout, they rallied to score two tries and were pressing for an improbable victory in the final minutes. Wales have developed character under Gatland, a refusal to accept defeat and a willingness to give everything. It was never likely to be enough against an Ireland team which, though Schmidt had made 11 changes from Twickenham, contained some established combinations and was primed with a strong bench with experienced players such as Rory Best probably feeling they had something to prove. Wales had the bulk of possession in the first half but trailed 15-3 at the break, having conceded two tries when they had been in possession. First Aled Davies was forced to kick hurriedly after Ryan Elias had been brought down a long way behind the gainline. Will Addison caught the ball running from deep and, after the prop Dave Kilcoyne evaded three tacklers, Jack Carty freed Andrew Conway with an inside pass. The wing weaved his way into Wales\u2019s 22, leaving four tacklers clutching nothing, before freeing Jacob Stockdale who had an unopposed 15-metre run to the line. He had rather more distance to cover 10 minutes later when Aaron Shingler flicked a pass out of the back of his hand to James Davies as Wales moved right on halfway. It was a manoeuvre Wales used not to indulge in but they now have a licence to skill. \u201cIt was not the pass but the execution,\u201d said Gatland. As the ball bounced behind Davies, Stockdale swooped, hacked ahead and accepted a kind bounce to beat Hallam Amos to the line. Jarrod Evans had earlier equalised Carty\u2019s opening penalty but it was otherwise a game to forget for the fly-half who was, in effect, in a shoot-out with the replacement Rhys Patchell for the role of Dan Biggar\u2019s deputy in Japan. He had few opportunities to launch his back division in his 40 minutes on the field with Wales overrun up front and at the breakdown but, as his desperation increased, he missed a penalty to touch one minute before Ireland\u2019s second try and was wide with a 25-metre kick at goal. Patchell seized his moment in the final 18 minutes. He had had no chance before that with Wales conceding a penalty try shortly after Brown had been sent to the sin-bin, but his ability to give his side width yielded a try for the debutant Owen Lane, a bustling wing who was used to supply the thrust Wales lacked in midfield, scoring on the right. When Patchell dummied over five minutes from the end, the home side scented the opportunity to extend their run of 11 consecutive victories in a sequence that stretched back 21 months. They fell short but the tear Gatland had in his eye when he took to the field at the end was a rare nod to sentiment. \u201cIt is emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have overachieved in the last 12 years and we are not finished yet. When we are mentally and physically right, we can give any team in the world a run. I believe we will go a long way in the World Cup.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Digital networks have two significant properties: they can expand very rapidly, given the right conditions, and, if they do grow, powerful network effects kick in very quickly. A network effect is the phenomenon whereby the value of a network increases according to the number of people using it. In the 1980s, Bob Metcalfe tried to quantify the multiplier effect of additional users with what became known as Metcalfe\u2019s law, which says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users. A network with 10 users has a value of 100, but one with a thousand users has a value of a million (1,000 squared).</p> <p>Ever since the web arrived, the overriding mantra of online entrepreneurs has been \u201cget big fast\u201d: recruit users or customers as quickly as possible to get to the point where the network effect kicks in and discourages potential competitors. For most of the successful firms, the way to achieve this was to offer free services. This was the route chosen by Google and, later, Facebook and YouTube. For Amazon, growth was achieved by low prices, efficient dispatch, good customer service, prompt delivery and a colossal inventory.</p> <p>But because capitalism never knows when to stop, eventually even the exponential growth rate promised by Metcalfe\u2019s law wasn\u2019t good enough for Google and co. They noticed Reed\u2019s law, which said that if a network can have sub-groups then its utility can grow at an even more colossal rate. And so they began to turn themselves into <a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27916/facebook-platform\" title=\"\"><em>platforms</em></a> on which entrepreneurs could build services.

As the tech analyst Benedict Evans summarised it last week in his newsletter: when you let anyone on Earth on to your platform, that includes bad people. \u201cConceptually,\u201d Evans says, \u201cthis is no different to what\u2019s been happening on Facebook or YouTube, except now it\u2019s lead in children\u2019s toys instead of Jihadi videos\u201d. He\u2019s right: tech platforms are double-edged swords. The problem is that the companies that live by them don\u2019t die by them.

      "body": "<p>Machines work well at a constant speed \u2013 and the faster the better. They are designed and built for it. Whether they are spinning cotton or crunching numbers, regular, repetitive actions are what they excel at. Increasingly, our world is designed by machines, for machines. Digital technology brings them ever more intimately into our lives. We hold our phones in the palm of our hand, but it is they that have us in their grasp. We adapt to machines and hold ourselves to their standards: people are judged by the speed with which they respond, not the quality of their response. We find ourselves in a state of \u201ccontinuous partial attention\u201d \u2013 rarely stopping, never fully present. Such ideas are being woven into our culture. \u201cAlways on\u201d becomes something to boast of, or aspire to. The moral high ground belongs to those who get on with things, not those who \u201cdelay\u201d. </p> <p>Most of us are busy most of the time, if not with work then with family, domestic tasks or our social networks \u2013 real and virtual. When I ask people how they are, they almost always answer \u201cbusy\u201d or some variation of it. Busy-ness is high status. We feel we are being \u201csensible, logical, responsible, practical\u201d. Ticking things off the \u201cto do\u201d list becomes a means of defining, or escaping ourselves. Faced with that anxiety we try to keep calm by carrying on, but what are we missing out on?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We hold our phones in the palm of our hand, but it is they that have us in their grasp</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In my work as associate fellow at Oxford University\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, I use methods drawn from improv theatre to explore how people respond to complex, changing circumstances. I have the chance to meet and observe hundreds of leaders, from all over the world and all walks of life. With rare exceptions, they feel they need to get better at \u201cwork-life\u201d balance \u2013 though none of them really knows what that means, or how they might attain it. By contrast, good improvisers always seem to have time, they don\u2019t hurry or rush. They are able to pause. And it is this, rather than an ability to think fast, that enables them to respond so effectively in situations they can neither predict nor control.</p> <p><em><strong>A few years ago,</strong></em> I became very interested in what it means to pause. I realised that this isn\u2019t as simple as it might seem. A pause could be a moment of silence or a year\u2019s sabbatical. I sought out people who pay attention to pauses: from actors and artists to musicians, film makers and Zen monks. I asked them about the value of gaps and spaces, about how they create them and what they get as a result. I reflected on the place where I live in rural Spain, and what it has that eludes people living more frantic lives. I read widely about rest, waiting, the \u201cSlow Movement\u201d and the nature of time itself.</p> <p>I started to notice where pauses show up in my own work and life. For example, I realised that when writing, a short walk was a more effective way to break a creative block than concentrating harder. When people came to visit me in Spain I saw how powerful brief periods of disconnection could be. As a friend from Oregon said, \u201cAfter a day here, I found myself solving problems I didn\u2019t know I had.\u201d Time isn\u2019t the same everywhere.</p> <p>I realised that a pause is not nothing. It acts as a kind of switch or opening. As Helene Simonsen, a classical musician, says, \u201cWhatever you are doing, if you want something else to happen, you need to pause.\u201d A film director spoke of how he used a tiny delay to grab the crew\u2019s attention on set: \u201cPause for the space of a breath or two, before you say \u2018Action\u2019 and it changes everything.\u201d Others spoke of pause as a \u201csweet emptiness\u201d, \u201ca quality of stopping\u201d or an \u201cactive presence\u201d. A pause is not so much an absence of thought or action, as an integral part of it.</p> <p>It is not a fixed unit of time. It might be taking a moment before you enter a room, but it could also be a \u201cscreen-free Saturday\u201d, a \u201cThink Week\u201d every two years (which works for Bill Gates) or a year-long sabbatical every seven years. However fast you are moving, there is always the chance to pause. To rest, reflect or recuperate of course, but also to appreciate, get perspective, connect to others, listen, add emphasis or have new ideas. You can pause for effect or pause for thought. It can be planned or spontaneous, momentary or lasting. When writing, I organise myself in 90-minute blocks of time, with scheduled pauses in between. I don\u2019t allow myself to go beyond the 90 minutes, even if I am on a roll. Often, I will go outside, or do something manual between blocks. This keeps my energy and enthusiasm up. And when I come back to the text, I often see things afresh (in fact, this just happened, as I came back to this piece after a break spent chatting with a friend).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I pause then come back to the text, I often see things afresh (in fact, this just happened)</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sometimes my pauses are responsive, not planned. When I get stressed, I have a phrase I say to myself: \u201cThere is time for everything.\u201d This punctuates the stream of anxious thoughts and reminds me that the sharp sense of urgency I feel is exactly that \u2013 a feeling in me, not something in the world. If there is no one else around, I will say it out loud. Making it physical makes it more powerful. Repeating it a few times has a calming effect, connecting me to my body and my breathing.</p> <p>In workshops or coaching sessions, I find the \u201cpregnant\u201d pause incredibly useful, particularly when I am unsure what to do next. I just say \u201cSo\u2026\u201d and leave what feels like a cavernous gap \u2013 though normally it is no more than 10 or 15 seconds. This invites whoever I am working with to voice their thoughts. The pause draws them forward, giving them the chance to shape our conversation.</p> <p>You can think about pause as a habit. One executive I worked with would take five minutes to himself, to do nothing in particular, before he left the office. He made it a way to close the day, and leave work thoughts at work, rather than carrying them home with him. You might think about designing longer and deeper pauses for yourself, and how you could create a space where pauses are woven into the fabric of your life or work. </p> <p>But it can be challenging. Some people were disconcerted when I told them I was working on a book about pause. There was one who immediately and indignantly declared, \u201cBut there is always a cost to pausing.\u201d The very idea created a kind of panic for her. There was an awkward silence. A pause, in fact. After a minute or so her husband added, \u201cPerhaps\u2026 but there is always a cost to not pausing as well.\u201d This illustrates the dilemma we are caught in.

Paying attention to when you pause (or don\u2019t) is a different way to think about your relationship to time. It invites you to think about finding your rhythm, not managing your time; about composing a life, not becoming more productive. This is about getting more out, not packing more in.

      "bodyText": "Machines work well at a constant speed \u2013 and the faster the better. They are designed and built for it. Whether they are spinning cotton or crunching numbers, regular, repetitive actions are what they excel at. Increasingly, our world is designed by machines, for machines. Digital technology brings them ever more intimately into our lives. We hold our phones in the palm of our hand, but it is they that have us in their grasp. We adapt to machines and hold ourselves to their standards: people are judged by the speed with which they respond, not the quality of their response. We find ourselves in a state of \u201ccontinuous partial attention\u201d \u2013 rarely stopping, never fully present. Such ideas are being woven into our culture. \u201cAlways on\u201d becomes something to boast of, or aspire to. The moral high ground belongs to those who get on with things, not those who \u201cdelay\u201d. Most of us are busy most of the time, if not with work then with family, domestic tasks or our social networks \u2013 real and virtual. When I ask people how they are, they almost always answer \u201cbusy\u201d or some variation of it. Busy-ness is high status. We feel we are being \u201csensible, logical, responsible, practical\u201d. Ticking things off the \u201cto do\u201d list becomes a means of defining, or escaping ourselves. Faced with that anxiety we try to keep calm by carrying on, but what are we missing out on? In my work as associate fellow at Oxford University\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, I use methods drawn from improv theatre to explore how people respond to complex, changing circumstances. I have the chance to meet and observe hundreds of leaders, from all over the world and all walks of life. With rare exceptions, they feel they need to get better at \u201cwork-life\u201d balance \u2013 though none of them really knows what that means, or how they might attain it. By contrast, good improvisers always seem to have time, they don\u2019t hurry or rush. They are able to pause. And it is this, rather than an ability to think fast, that enables them to respond so effectively in situations they can neither predict nor control. A few years ago, I became very interested in what it means to pause. I realised that this isn\u2019t as simple as it might seem. A pause could be a moment of silence or a year\u2019s sabbatical. I sought out people who pay attention to pauses: from actors and artists to musicians, film makers and Zen monks. I asked them about the value of gaps and spaces, about how they create them and what they get as a result. I reflected on the place where I live in rural Spain, and what it has that eludes people living more frantic lives. I read widely about rest, waiting, the \u201cSlow Movement\u201d and the nature of time itself. I started to notice where pauses show up in my own work and life. For example, I realised that when writing, a short walk was a more effective way to break a creative block than concentrating harder. When people came to visit me in Spain I saw how powerful brief periods of disconnection could be. As a friend from Oregon said, \u201cAfter a day here, I found myself solving problems I didn\u2019t know I had.\u201d Time isn\u2019t the same everywhere. I realised that a pause is not nothing. It acts as a kind of switch or opening. As Helene Simonsen, a classical musician, says, \u201cWhatever you are doing, if you want something else to happen, you need to pause.\u201d A film director spoke of how he used a tiny delay to grab the crew\u2019s attention on set: \u201cPause for the space of a breath or two, before you say \u2018Action\u2019 and it changes everything.\u201d Others spoke of pause as a \u201csweet emptiness\u201d, \u201ca quality of stopping\u201d or an \u201cactive presence\u201d. A pause is not so much an absence of thought or action, as an integral part of it. It is not a fixed unit of time. It might be taking a moment before you enter a room, but it could also be a \u201cscreen-free Saturday\u201d, a \u201cThink Week\u201d every two years (which works for Bill Gates) or a year-long sabbatical every seven years. However fast you are moving, there is always the chance to pause. To rest, reflect or recuperate of course, but also to appreciate, get perspective, connect to others, listen, add emphasis or have new ideas. You can pause for effect or pause for thought. It can be planned or spontaneous, momentary or lasting. When writing, I organise myself in 90-minute blocks of time, with scheduled pauses in between. I don\u2019t allow myself to go beyond the 90 minutes, even if I am on a roll. Often, I will go outside, or do something manual between blocks. This keeps my energy and enthusiasm up. And when I come back to the text, I often see things afresh (in fact, this just happened, as I came back to this piece after a break spent chatting with a friend). Sometimes my pauses are responsive, not planned. When I get stressed, I have a phrase I say to myself: \u201cThere is time for everything.\u201d This punctuates the stream of anxious thoughts and reminds me that the sharp sense of urgency I feel is exactly that \u2013 a feeling in me, not something in the world. If there is no one else around, I will say it out loud. Making it physical makes it more powerful. Repeating it a few times has a calming effect, connecting me to my body and my breathing. In workshops or coaching sessions, I find the \u201cpregnant\u201d pause incredibly useful, particularly when I am unsure what to do next. I just say \u201cSo\u2026\u201d and leave what feels like a cavernous gap \u2013 though normally it is no more than 10 or 15 seconds. This invites whoever I am working with to voice their thoughts. The pause draws them forward, giving them the chance to shape our conversation. You can think about pause as a habit. One executive I worked with would take five minutes to himself, to do nothing in particular, before he left the office. He made it a way to close the day, and leave work thoughts at work, rather than carrying them home with him. You might think about designing longer and deeper pauses for yourself, and how you could create a space where pauses are woven into the fabric of your life or work. But it can be challenging. Some people were disconcerted when I told them I was working on a book about pause. There was one who immediately and indignantly declared, \u201cBut there is always a cost to pausing.\u201d The very idea created a kind of panic for her. There was an awkward silence. A pause, in fact. After a minute or so her husband added, \u201cPerhaps\u2026 but there is always a cost to not pausing as well.\u201d This illustrates the dilemma we are caught in. If time is money, then pausing will cost you. But what about the cost of not pausing? What about the opportunities you miss, the perspective you lose, the connections you don\u2019t make, the enjoyment you forsake? Others struggle with the slippery nature of pause. If a pause can be so many different things,where should I start? Try this; make pause a \u201cthing\u201d and start noticing how, where and when you pause (or don\u2019t).

In another Which? survey, consumers offered some insight into that lowly status, deriding the airline\u2019s premium offering for cramped seating, \u201cinedible\u201d food and poor entertainment options.</p> <p>One passenger said that BA\u2019s premium cabins were little more than \u201cRyanair with free food\u201d.</p> <p>John Strickland, director of independent transport consultancy JLS Consulting, worked for BA after privatisation and recalls how the former national flag carrier successfully shook off the running joke that its initials stood for \u201cBloody Awful\u201d, improving rapidly under the stewardship of the late Lords King and Marshall. \u201cAt that time BA was so far ahead, but we didn\u2019t have low-cost airlines on short-haul or serious long-haul competition in a meaningful way side by side at Heathrow. The Gulf carriers were embryonic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHaving established that lead in the 80s and 90s, BA fell behind in recent years, taking their eye off the ball, particularly in premium. They\u2019re very aware of that and they\u2019re actively trying to put it right but it\u2019s not like changing the wrapper on a Mars Bar, it\u2019s a medium-term investment, taking at least a couple of years, to fully take delivery of new aircraft, refit cabin interiors and retire some older aircraft.\u201d</p> <p>Strickland acknowledged that some of the airlines that won plaudits for their superior long-haul service, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, enjoyed advantages that BA did not, such as state subsidies or low labour costs.</p> <p>Burnside felt that BA has become trapped between long-haul rivals with their luxurious offering and low-cost carriers that had emerged over the past two decades. \u201cOn the route that I take almost weekly, to Belfast, it\u2019s a premium price that\u2019s being charged and frankly the service is no better than easyJet,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/24/ba-sorry-for-sending-flight-cancellation-email-to-wrong-passengers\">BA sorry for sending flight cancellation email to wrong passengers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo not give people a cup of coffee and a packet of peanuts is a bad mistake.

It is also promising revamped in-flight menus and upgraded bedding for premium passengers. There will also be a new Club Suite for business class.</p> <p>BA can afford this much-needed investment because all that cost-cutting has made for bumper profits. Accounts for parent company IAG, formed via the \u00a35bn merger of BA and Iberia in 2011, show that the British part of the airline is by far the most lucrative, reporting operating profit of \u20ac873m (\u00a3790m) in the first half of 2019, having made nearly \u20ac2bn for the full year in 2018.</p> <p>But while profits have held up, shareholder sentiment has tracked BA\u2019s very public travails. Parent company IAG\u2019s shares are down by a third over the past 18 months.</p> <p>And while staff at the coalface are working hard to rebuild BA\u2019s image, their effort has been overshadowed by senior management becoming embroiled in potentially distracting rows. Earlier this year the airline appeared to be having a spat with the <em>Financial Times</em>, when it <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/british-airways-has-stopped-offering-financial-times-over-coverage-of-airline-source-claims/\" title=\"\">stopped providing the paper</a> on flights, in its lounges or at gates worldwide. BA insisted the decision was simply the result of a review, but the <em>FT</em> described the decision as abrupt and insiders at the newspaper suggested BA\u2019s action was linked to what the airline viewed as unfavourable coverage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-30T15:34:33/embed.html\" data-alt=\"IAG share price\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-30T15:34:33/embed.html\">IAG share price</a> </figure>  <p>More recently, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/21/ba-chief-says-heathrow-cannot-be-trusted-on-third-runway-costs\" title=\"\">made strong criticism</a> of Heathrow, accusing the airport\u2019s management of dishonesty.

They just make us realise what BA once was and no longer is. You can\u2019t advertise yourself out of a bad reputation.\u201d</p>",

The fragility of BA\u2019s IT security was laid bare last year when hackers stole the personal data of half a million customers, a breach that led to a \u00a3183m fine from the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. Last month a computer systems glitch meant that more than 500 flights were cancelled or delayed, causing chaos and misery for tens of thousands of passengers. In the past week BA has further incurred the anger of its customers with its cack-handed response to a series of pilots\u2019 strikes due to take place in September. Customers complained of being told, incorrectly, that their flights had been cancelled. Some rebooked with other airlines, only to find their original bookings were back on after all. Others could not reach the airline by phone, despite trying dozens of times. David Burnside, head of public affairs at BA for nearly a decade from 1984, remembers when the airline was still seen as the global pinnacle of aviation. \u201cBA is still a good international airline but they keep running into mistakes and they seem to have lost their aspirational drive,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cThey dropped [the advertising slogan] \u2018the world\u2019s favourite airline\u2019 around the beginning of this century. That was an aspiration that kept customer service at the forefront of people\u2019s minds. If you claimed it, you had to maintain the standards.\u201d While there is an element of misfortune about BA\u2019s recent travails, those standards do appear to have been slipping. Complaints include the removal of free food on short-haul services, cramped business-class cabins and dog-eared interiors. Amid a chorus of passenger disaffection, the one-time \u201cworld\u2019s favourite\u201d sank to 31st in the 2018 airline rankings produced by Skytrax. The lacklustre showing saw BA fall below relative newcomers such as Malaysia\u2019s Air Asia, as well as the likes of Russia\u2019s Aeroflot, a byword for dilapidation just a decade or so ago. BA recovered somewhat in this year\u2019s rankings, but still only claimed 19th spot. A recent survey by consumers\u2019 organisation Which? rated BA 83rd out of 100 UK companies for quality of service. In another Which? survey, consumers offered some insight into that lowly status, deriding the airline\u2019s premium offering for cramped seating, \u201cinedible\u201d food and poor entertainment options. One passenger said that BA\u2019s premium cabins were little more than \u201cRyanair with free food\u201d. John Strickland, director of independent transport consultancy JLS Consulting, worked for BA after privatisation and recalls how the former national flag carrier successfully shook off the running joke that its initials stood for \u201cBloody Awful\u201d, improving rapidly under the stewardship of the late Lords King and Marshall. \u201cAt that time BA was so far ahead, but we didn\u2019t have low-cost airlines on short-haul or serious long-haul competition in a meaningful way side by side at Heathrow. The Gulf carriers were embryonic,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving established that lead in the 80s and 90s, BA fell behind in recent years, taking their eye off the ball, particularly in premium. They\u2019re very aware of that and they\u2019re actively trying to put it right but it\u2019s not like changing the wrapper on a Mars Bar, it\u2019s a medium-term investment, taking at least a couple of years, to fully take delivery of new aircraft, refit cabin interiors and retire some older aircraft.\u201d Strickland acknowledged that some of the airlines that won plaudits for their superior long-haul service, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, enjoyed advantages that BA did not, such as state subsidies or low labour costs. Burnside felt that BA has become trapped between long-haul rivals with their luxurious offering and low-cost carriers that had emerged over the past two decades. \u201cOn the route that I take almost weekly, to Belfast, it\u2019s a premium price that\u2019s being charged and frankly the service is no better than easyJet,\u201d he said. \u201cTo not give people a cup of coffee and a packet of peanuts is a bad mistake. It irritates people when they\u2019re paying hundreds of pounds for their ticket.\u201d On long haul, Burnside said that regardless of what advantages some rivals offered, BA could not afford to be left behind on quality. \u201cThey\u2019re losing business to Middle Eastern carriers. I know people deciding to fly Turkish to Istanbul rather than BA because it\u2019s a better service, or to Bahrain on Gulf Air. \u201cThe cost [of improving service] might be a bit higher but otherwise you\u2019re losing business class travel.\u201d BA\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, countered: \u201cWe are proud to fly more than 45 million customers a year and, while challenges remain and change takes time to deliver in aviation, our customers are noticing the investments we are making.\u201d The airline is taking delivery of 73 new aircraft including A350s and 787s, refurbishing its long-haul cabins, and redesigning its airport lounges. It is also promising revamped in-flight menus and upgraded bedding for premium passengers. There will also be a new Club Suite for business class. BA can afford this much-needed investment because all that cost-cutting has made for bumper profits. Accounts for parent company IAG, formed via the \u00a35bn merger of BA and Iberia in 2011, show that the British part of the airline is by far the most lucrative, reporting operating profit of \u20ac873m (\u00a3790m) in the first half of 2019, having made nearly \u20ac2bn for the full year in 2018. But while profits have held up, shareholder sentiment has tracked BA\u2019s very public travails. Parent company IAG\u2019s shares are down by a third over the past 18 months. And while staff at the coalface are working hard to rebuild BA\u2019s image, their effort has been overshadowed by senior management becoming embroiled in potentially distracting rows. Earlier this year the airline appeared to be having a spat with the Financial Times, when it stopped providing the paper on flights, in its lounges or at gates worldwide. BA insisted the decision was simply the result of a review, but the FT described the decision as abrupt and insiders at the newspaper suggested BA\u2019s action was linked to what the airline viewed as unfavourable coverage. More recently, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh made strong criticism of Heathrow, accusing the airport\u2019s management of dishonesty. BA also lost friends in the gay community when it did not follow Virgin Atlantic\u2019s example in refusing to deport LGBT asylum seekers, a decision that spawned allegations of hypocrisy given the airline\u2019s sponsorship of Brighton Pride. With strikes looming, and amid operational failures, high-profile rows and customer dissatisfaction, BA will have to hope that its multibillion-dollar investment in quality of service will soon start to pay off. According to branding guru Mark Borkowski, glossy celebrity-fronted advertising campaigns won\u2019t do the trick on their own. \u201cIf a brand is going to change, it has to change from the top, from people really wanting to do it, and most of the posturing BA has done about who and what it is just isn\u2019t authentic. \u201cThe advert initiatives don\u2019t match the brand and what it delivers. They just make us realise what BA once was and no longer is. You can\u2019t advertise yourself out of a bad reputation.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When you\u2019re writing, everything goes into the mix.</p> <p>At one o\u2019clock in the morning, in the Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, our daughter, Molly, was born. It was a sweltering night, the hottest of the year, the late August bank holiday in 2001. A couple of hours later, I left the maternity unit, walked along some corridors, descended the stairs and passed into reception. I heard shouts and threats. Two groups of angry youths were screaming into each other\u2019s faces. They pushed and shoved while visitors and staff did their best to stay out of the way and safe. A few punches were thrown, but the punches were, like the confrontation itself, disorganised and random. I steered myself through the melee and exited to the car park, where I saw a shirtless young man hooked up to a drip, dressings on wounds on his arms and shoulder, trading shoves with an antagonist.</p> <p>At 10 the following morning, Georgina called. She wanted to come home. I put Finn, our 20-month-old son, into the car and drove the short distance to the hospital. Georgina was glad to be out. It was a beautiful day. She suggested we go to the Old English Garden in Victoria Park.</p> <p>We sat on a bench and marvelled at the baby. The garden was past its summer best, but the sky was blue, the sun shone and we had a beautiful new daughter. A lady walked by with a male companion. She was, I would guess, in her 70s. She did a double take and came back a step. \u201cThat\u2019s a very new baby,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen was that baby born?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne o\u2019clock this morning,\u201d Georgina said.</p> <p>The lady burst out laughing. \u201cIn my day,\u201d she said, \u201cthey kept you in for two weeks. They wouldn\u2019t let you get out of bed.\u201d She went off laughing quietly and shaking her head.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ2-PpXOsvw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VZ2-PpXOsvw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ2-PpXOsvw\">Watch a trailer for the new series of Top Boy.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>I was full of admiration for Georgina. So strong. So determined. Invincible. Life could not be better.</p> <p>Twelve years later, Georgina and I were watching the final episode of season two of <em>Top Boy</em> on Channel 4. Suddenly, her left eyelid dropped involuntarily. She had had her right eye removed the year before. Further radiotherapy gave her some control over the wayward eyelid and restored her partial vision. She died four months later. No one is invincible, it turns out.</p> <p>After her death, my priorities were, first, the children, then work. To work, I had to organise a system in the house. Finn and Molly, by then 14 and 12, would have to learn to cook and take turns to make the dinner. When one cooked, the other would have to wash up. They had to keep their rooms tidy. They had to be responsible about making sure the front door was double-locked and the windows closed when they went out. We became a tight and, eventually, once again a happy little unit.</p> <p>On Georgina\u2019s birthday, we went to the same bench in the Old English Garden and recalled funny little stories about her. It was sad and happy. I left a flower on the bench when we left.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, I came across a heartbreaking story in a newspaper about a husband and wife who died within days of each other. There was a photograph of the two of them in the hospice, exhausted, semi-conscious, near the end. Their beds had been pushed next to each other so they could hold hands. They left three children. The eldest became guardian to his younger siblings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e8bfffa3cf9b0314b49d66b94d163254564770d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8bfffa3cf9b0314b49d66b94d163254564770d6/0_731_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ronan Bennett and script consultant Gerry Jackson in Ridley Road Market, Dalston, one of Top Boy\u2019s shooting locations.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ronan Bennett and script consultant Gerry Jackson in Ridley Road Market, Dalston, one of Top Boy\u2019s shooting locations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everything goes into the mix. I knew that one day I would write about these things and I knew where I wanted to write about them. In <em>Top Boy</em>. On buses, on walks, in the shower, I started to build on these scenes and invent characters and relationships. I knew all this would work in <em>Top Boy</em>.</p> <p>The only problem was that <em>Top Boy</em> had been cancelled.</p> <p><em>Top Boy </em>began life a decade ago when I witnessed a small child dealing drugs outside my local supermarket (I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/oct/09/top-boy-teenage-drug-dealers\" title=\"\">wrote about the show\u2019s genesis</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/oct/09/top-boy-teenage-drug-dealers\" title=\"\">the <em>Observer</em></a> when the first season came out on Channel 4 in 2011). My interest piqued, I talked about it to my good friend Gerry Jackson, a well-known and hugely respected figure in the community. He vouched for me and young men and women began to open up and tell me their stories. The more I heard, the more interested I became in the why of the lives they led. We talked a lot about drugs, police and prisons, and the mechanics of dealing, but we also talked about homes and mothers, fathers and siblings; about school and college; clothes and trainers; music and TV. They were all \u2013 every one of them \u2013 from poor and disadvantaged families. And they were mostly black.</p> <p>When I was ready to write I approached the BBC. A script was commissioned and delivered. But the head of drama balked at the subject matter and the language. The word milf was, back in the pre-<em>Flea</em><em>bag</em> era, not acceptable. It was clear that I looking in the wrong place for a home for the show. Discouraged, I put <em>Top Boy</em> into the computer\u2019s metaphorical bottom drawer.</p> <p>About a year later, my agent, Charles Collier, introduced me to Alasdair Flind and Charles Steel at Cowboy Films. Over lunch, Aly, Charles and I explored possible projects to work together on. I mentioned <em>Top Boy</em>. They brought it to Liza Marshall, who was then head of drama at Channel 4. Liza green-lit the show almost immediately. Yann Demange, whom I had met at a screenwriting lab in Jordan a week or two before, came on as director.</p> <p>If you write a good novel, it\u2019s a good novel. But film-making is different. You can write a decent script, you can have a director as talented and original as Yann, you can have actors as compelling as Ashley Walters and Kane Robinson (AKA rappers Asher D and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/01/kano-hoodies-all-summer-review-trouble\" title=\"\">Kano</a>), you can have truly brilliant production designers, directors of photography, sound recordists, colourists, music supervisors and composers and all the rest \u2013 and still the thing you create together lacks magic. It\u2019s very painful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53549efa6698b77d66dd74dfa702caabc2ccb35f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53549efa6698b77d66dd74dfa702caabc2ccb35f/0_297_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Micheal Ward joins the cast of the new series as Jamie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Micheal Ward joins the cast of the new series as Jamie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Harris/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Equally, film-makers know when they\u2019ve made something special, even before the critics have had a chance to see it. You watch the rushes, they\u2019re promising. You watch the first cut, it\u2019s looking good. There are more cuts, then picture lock. You watch again. Your pulse quickens. Is this as good as I think it is? You watch the final grade and mix. And then everyone knows.</p> <p><em>Top Boy</em>\u2019s first season, screened over four consecutive nights, was an instant hit. Set on the fictional Summerhouse estate, it tells the story of two young dealers Dushane (Ashley Walters) and his friend Sully (Kane Robinson) as they fight to take over the drug trade in their area. But <em>Top Boy</em> was much more than a crime story. It located Dushane and Sully in a community. Family was the beating heart of the show. Love and loyalty tugged at the characters as they weighed their decisions and the consequences of their actions.</p> <p>Young audiences in particular loved it. They saw their lives on screen and responded with huge excitement. Replying to the gushing of fans on Twitter, someone pointed out: you do realise that Ronan Bennett is a middle-aged Irishman? Yup, that\u2019s me, as if being one thing precludes you from writing about another. After all, writers imagine themselves to be all sorts of things, from serial murderers and time travellers to eighth-century Anglo-Saxon concubines.</p> <p>But writers don\u2019t just write. They live in communities like everyone else, and they watch and they listen. In the bad old days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/stop-and-search\" title=\"\">stop and search</a> (bad old days which are apparently on the way back, astonishingly), I would look out the window of a bus and see young black men surrounded by (almost always) white police officers, their hands up, their pockets turned out, their expressions variously angry, humiliated, scared, resigned, defiant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"83a719fddd42492bf48cd8ea9d53f4af524fa8c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a719fddd42492bf48cd8ea9d53f4af524fa8c7/0_1478_4912_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dave, who also joins the cast in the new series.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dave, who also joins the cast in the new series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, out canvassing with my local Labour party colleagues, I would knock on doors to have them answered by people with all kinds of problems: benefit sanctions, electricity bill arrears, deportation threats, untreated mental health problems, damp, overcrowding, vandalism, piss on the stairs, lifts that don\u2019t work, children in trouble with the police. The thing these problems have in common is that they all arise directly from or are exacerbated by poverty. This is the world in which top boys thrive: the world of deprivation, racism and exclusion, in which youths take whatever opportunities come their way in order to get ahead. All of this goes into <em>Top Boy</em>.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t take much imagination to think your way into this world. And maybe if you\u2019re Irish it\u2019s a little easier. Whenever I see the photograph of the infamous No Blacks, No Irish, No Dogs sign hung in an English boarding house window, I feel proud. There\u2019s an empathy there. An understanding. Back when I had heroes, one of my earliest ones was George Jackson. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=soledad+brothers\" title=\"\">Google him</a>. One of the Soledad Brothers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/top-boy-ashley-walters-kano\">Ashley Walters and Kano: 'Top Boy hit the nail on the head'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Imagining it is one thing, getting it right is another. The depiction has to be authentic. I recorded my interviewees. They talked about paper (money), brown (heroin), dubs and white (crack and coke), the po-po and feds (police), snakes (informers). The dialogue on the page started with my version of it (I got better at it as we went along). Then Gerry would look it over and make amendments. Later, the scenes were workshopped and the actors would replace words if they thought of a better one. In <em>Top Boy</em>, I don\u2019t care how an actor says it as long as the line carries the same meaning and nuance. In season three, Sully orders someone to be killed: kill him, in my script. Light him up, in Kane\u2019s version.</p> <p>Just as important as the dialogue is the casting: the actors have to look like they come from the <em>Top Boy </em>world. Here we had the great good fortune to have Des Hamilton cast for us. Des, who hails from a background not a million miles away from that of the characters themselves, has a natural empathy with the sidelined and overlooked and he knows how to unlock their potential. In season one, only a handful of our cast had acted before. One of the standout performances was that of Shone Romulus as Dris. Des and Yann found Shone hanging around the forecourt of his block of flats in Hackney.</p> <p><em>Top Boy </em>won an Royal Television Society award for best drama and Brian Eno won a Bafta for his score. We got an audience too and, what\u2019s more, the kind of audience broadcasters are chasing \u2013 young and diverse. Channel 4 immediately ordered a second series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0363f9d645f068100f4cbf35fd94f5ee30b49a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0363f9d645f068100f4cbf35fd94f5ee30b49a3/0_71_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first series of Top Boy (l-r): Tareek (Sean Sagar), Dris (Shone Romulus), Dushane (Ashley Walters) &amp; Sully (Kane Robinson).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first series of Top Boy (l-r): Tareek (Sean Sagar), Dris (Shone Romulus), Dushane (Ashley Walters) &amp; Sully (Kane Robinson).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hopkins/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I went to work on the scripts for season two, Georgina was dying. Our house, where I usually worked, was full of loving and busy friends and family. Sometimes, I went to the Cowboy offices to write. Charles and Aly worried about whether I would get the scripts written. Standing down a production because the writer can\u2019t produce is an expensive business. They were right to be concerned. Some days, my heart was so low and my thoughts so inward that I couldn\u2019t write. There were appointments with the oncologist and surgeon. There were scans and then the wait for the result. There were sudden dashes home to deal with emergencies. There were ambulance call-outs and races to A&amp;E in the early hours of the morning. There were endless packages of drugs to be collected from the pharmacy. Georgina underwent major surgery at the Charing Cross hospital, a long way from Hackney. Later, when the cancer spread to her bones, her left femur became so brittle that she had to have a metal implants to keep it from snapping. Finn and Molly still had to be taken to swimming and got off to school with packed lunches in the morning. The house still had to be a happy home for them.</p> <p>I poured it all into the scripts. In season two, directed by Jonathan van Tulleken, Joe, an associate of Dushane\u2019s is shot and seriously wounded. He ends up in intensive care. There are a lot of hospital scenes. There\u2019s a darkness about the whole season. Death hangs over everyone. The final sequence is harrowing. Had my head been in a different place, I would have questioned the ending. Unlike season one, whose ending was tough but nevertheless had hope, season two finished on the death of a child. Dushane, the protagonist, is last seen running for his life. There was no hope because at the time I was living without hope.</p> <p>Bleak as it was, season two received the same ecstatic reviews and audience enthusiasm. Channel 4 ordered the pilot for a third season. Charles, Aly and I started to discuss storylines. The new head of drama invited me to lunch. As soon as I walked into the restaurant I could see from his body language that he was about to break some bad news.</p> <p>Screenwriters learn to roll with the blows. A show you believe in doesn\u2019t get made. A show that gets audiences and the critics onside is cancelled. You sigh. You shrug. You move on to the next thing. But <em>Top Boy</em> was special to me. It was intensely personal. It was hard to let go. We discussed trying to make a movie. There was talk of doing it as a musical. But in the end, we accepted that was that. Time to move on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"561bd9fdacad0237171dfd3f4bfb1e1a569ccc1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/561bd9fdacad0237171dfd3f4bfb1e1a569ccc1e/716_0_3196_3195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drake performing at Wireless festival, London, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drake performing at Wireless festival, London, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Curtis Hughes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three years ago, Charles called me to tell me that a Canadian singer had seen the show and wanted to help get it up again. In showbusiness, lots of people express interest in lots of things. \u201cI\u2019m excited\u201d is a much-mimicked showbiz line. I didn\u2019t pay much attention. But some months later, Charles called again to say that the singer was in town and wanted to meet. Molly and Finn asked where I was going. To meet some singer called Drake. \u201cWhat?! How do you know Drake?\u201d I Googled him quickly. Turns out he\u2019s big.</p> <p>In person, Drake is a humble man.

      "bodyText": "When you\u2019re writing, everything goes into the mix. At one o\u2019clock in the morning, in the Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, our daughter, Molly, was born. It was a sweltering night, the hottest of the year, the late August bank holiday in 2001. A couple of hours later, I left the maternity unit, walked along some corridors, descended the stairs and passed into reception. I heard shouts and threats. Two groups of angry youths were screaming into each other\u2019s faces. They pushed and shoved while visitors and staff did their best to stay out of the way and safe. A few punches were thrown, but the punches were, like the confrontation itself, disorganised and random. I steered myself through the melee and exited to the car park, where I saw a shirtless young man hooked up to a drip, dressings on wounds on his arms and shoulder, trading shoves with an antagonist. At 10 the following morning, Georgina called. She wanted to come home. I put Finn, our 20-month-old son, into the car and drove the short distance to the hospital. Georgina was glad to be out. It was a beautiful day. She suggested we go to the Old English Garden in Victoria Park. We sat on a bench and marvelled at the baby. The garden was past its summer best, but the sky was blue, the sun shone and we had a beautiful new daughter. A lady walked by with a male companion. She was, I would guess, in her 70s. She did a double take and came back a step. \u201cThat\u2019s a very new baby,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen was that baby born?\u201d \u201cOne o\u2019clock this morning,\u201d Georgina said. The lady burst out laughing. \u201cIn my day,\u201d she said, \u201cthey kept you in for two weeks. They wouldn\u2019t let you get out of bed.\u201d She went off laughing quietly and shaking her head. I was full of admiration for Georgina. So strong. So determined. Invincible. Life could not be better. Twelve years later, Georgina and I were watching the final episode of season two of Top Boy on Channel 4. Suddenly, her left eyelid dropped involuntarily. She had had her right eye removed the year before. Further radiotherapy gave her some control over the wayward eyelid and restored her partial vision. She died four months later. No one is invincible, it turns out. After her death, my priorities were, first, the children, then work. To work, I had to organise a system in the house. Finn and Molly, by then 14 and 12, would have to learn to cook and take turns to make the dinner. When one cooked, the other would have to wash up. They had to keep their rooms tidy. They had to be responsible about making sure the front door was double-locked and the windows closed when they went out. We became a tight and, eventually, once again a happy little unit. On Georgina\u2019s birthday, we went to the same bench in the Old English Garden and recalled funny little stories about her. It was sad and happy. I left a flower on the bench when we left. Shortly afterwards, I came across a heartbreaking story in a newspaper about a husband and wife who died within days of each other. There was a photograph of the two of them in the hospice, exhausted, semi-conscious, near the end. Their beds had been pushed next to each other so they could hold hands. They left three children. The eldest became guardian to his younger siblings. Everything goes into the mix. I knew that one day I would write about these things and I knew where I wanted to write about them. In Top Boy. On buses, on walks, in the shower, I started to build on these scenes and invent characters and relationships. I knew all this would work in Top Boy. The only problem was that Top Boy had been cancelled. Top Boy began life a decade ago when I witnessed a small child dealing drugs outside my local supermarket (I wrote about the show\u2019s genesis in the Observer when the first season came out on Channel 4 in 2011). My interest piqued, I talked about it to my good friend Gerry Jackson, a well-known and hugely respected figure in the community. He vouched for me and young men and women began to open up and tell me their stories. The more I heard, the more interested I became in the why of the lives they led. We talked a lot about drugs, police and prisons, and the mechanics of dealing, but we also talked about homes and mothers, fathers and siblings; about school and college; clothes and trainers; music and TV. They were all \u2013 every one of them \u2013 from poor and disadvantaged families. And they were mostly black. When I was ready to write I approached the BBC. A script was commissioned and delivered. But the head of drama balked at the subject matter and the language. The word milf was, back in the pre-Fleabag era, not acceptable. It was clear that I looking in the wrong place for a home for the show. Discouraged, I put Top Boy into the computer\u2019s metaphorical bottom drawer. About a year later, my agent, Charles Collier, introduced me to Alasdair Flind and Charles Steel at Cowboy Films. Over lunch, Aly, Charles and I explored possible projects to work together on. I mentioned Top Boy. They brought it to Liza Marshall, who was then head of drama at Channel 4. Liza green-lit the show almost immediately. Yann Demange, whom I had met at a screenwriting lab in Jordan a week or two before, came on as director. If you write a good novel, it\u2019s a good novel. But film-making is different. You can write a decent script, you can have a director as talented and original as Yann, you can have actors as compelling as Ashley Walters and Kane Robinson (AKA rappers Asher D and Kano), you can have truly brilliant production designers, directors of photography, sound recordists, colourists, music supervisors and composers and all the rest \u2013 and still the thing you create together lacks magic. It\u2019s very painful. Equally, film-makers know when they\u2019ve made something special, even before the critics have had a chance to see it. You watch the rushes, they\u2019re promising. You watch the first cut, it\u2019s looking good. There are more cuts, then picture lock. You watch again. Your pulse quickens. Is this as good as I think it is? You watch the final grade and mix. And then everyone knows. Top Boy\u2019s first season, screened over four consecutive nights, was an instant hit. Set on the fictional Summerhouse estate, it tells the story of two young dealers Dushane (Ashley Walters) and his friend Sully (Kane Robinson) as they fight to take over the drug trade in their area. But Top Boy was much more than a crime story. It located Dushane and Sully in a community. Family was the beating heart of the show. Love and loyalty tugged at the characters as they weighed their decisions and the consequences of their actions. Young audiences in particular loved it. They saw their lives on screen and responded with huge excitement. Replying to the gushing of fans on Twitter, someone pointed out: you do realise that Ronan Bennett is a middle-aged Irishman? Yup, that\u2019s me, as if being one thing precludes you from writing about another. After all, writers imagine themselves to be all sorts of things, from serial murderers and time travellers to eighth-century Anglo-Saxon concubines. But writers don\u2019t just write. They live in communities like everyone else, and they watch and they listen. In the bad old days of stop and search (bad old days which are apparently on the way back, astonishingly), I would look out the window of a bus and see young black men surrounded by (almost always) white police officers, their hands up, their pockets turned out, their expressions variously angry, humiliated, scared, resigned, defiant. Later, out canvassing with my local Labour party colleagues, I would knock on doors to have them answered by people with all kinds of problems: benefit sanctions, electricity bill arrears, deportation threats, untreated mental health problems, damp, overcrowding, vandalism, piss on the stairs, lifts that don\u2019t work, children in trouble with the police. The thing these problems have in common is that they all arise directly from or are exacerbated by poverty. This is the world in which top boys thrive: the world of deprivation, racism and exclusion, in which youths take whatever opportunities come their way in order to get ahead. All of this goes into Top Boy. It doesn\u2019t take much imagination to think your way into this world. And maybe if you\u2019re Irish it\u2019s a little easier. Whenever I see the photograph of the infamous No Blacks, No Irish, No Dogs sign hung in an English boarding house window, I feel proud. There\u2019s an empathy there. An understanding. Back when I had heroes, one of my earliest ones was George Jackson. Google him. One of the Soledad Brothers. Imagining it is one thing, getting it right is another. The depiction has to be authentic. I recorded my interviewees. They talked about paper (money), brown (heroin), dubs and white (crack and coke), the po-po and feds (police), snakes (informers). The dialogue on the page started with my version of it (I got better at it as we went along). Then Gerry would look it over and make amendments. Later, the scenes were workshopped and the actors would replace words if they thought of a better one. In Top Boy, I don\u2019t care how an actor says it as long as the line carries the same meaning and nuance. In season three, Sully orders someone to be killed: kill him, in my script. Light him up, in Kane\u2019s version. Just as important as the dialogue is the casting: the actors have to look like they come from the Top Boy world. Here we had the great good fortune to have Des Hamilton cast for us. Des, who hails from a background not a million miles away from that of the characters themselves, has a natural empathy with the sidelined and overlooked and he knows how to unlock their potential. In season one, only a handful of our cast had acted before. One of the standout performances was that of Shone Romulus as Dris. Des and Yann found Shone hanging around the forecourt of his block of flats in Hackney. Top Boy won an Royal Television Society award for best drama and Brian Eno won a Bafta for his score. We got an audience too and, what\u2019s more, the kind of audience broadcasters are chasing \u2013 young and diverse. Channel 4 immediately ordered a second series. By the time I went to work on the scripts for season two, Georgina was dying. Our house, where I usually worked, was full of loving and busy friends and family. Sometimes, I went to the Cowboy offices to write. Charles and Aly worried about whether I would get the scripts written. Standing down a production because the writer can\u2019t produce is an expensive business. They were right to be concerned. Some days, my heart was so low and my thoughts so inward that I couldn\u2019t write. There were appointments with the oncologist and surgeon. There were scans and then the wait for the result. There were sudden dashes home to deal with emergencies. There were ambulance call-outs and races to A&amp;E in the early hours of the morning. There were endless packages of drugs to be collected from the pharmacy. Georgina underwent major surgery at the Charing Cross hospital, a long way from Hackney. Later, when the cancer spread to her bones, her left femur became so brittle that she had to have a metal implants to keep it from snapping. Finn and Molly still had to be taken to swimming and got off to school with packed lunches in the morning. The house still had to be a happy home for them. I poured it all into the scripts. In season two, directed by Jonathan van Tulleken, Joe, an associate of Dushane\u2019s is shot and seriously wounded. He ends up in intensive care. There are a lot of hospital scenes. There\u2019s a darkness about the whole season. Death hangs over everyone. The final sequence is harrowing. Had my head been in a different place, I would have questioned the ending. Unlike season one, whose ending was tough but nevertheless had hope, season two finished on the death of a child. Dushane, the protagonist, is last seen running for his life. There was no hope because at the time I was living without hope. Bleak as it was, season two received the same ecstatic reviews and audience enthusiasm. Channel 4 ordered the pilot for a third season. Charles, Aly and I started to discuss storylines. The new head of drama invited me to lunch. As soon as I walked into the restaurant I could see from his body language that he was about to break some bad news. Screenwriters learn to roll with the blows. A show you believe in doesn\u2019t get made. A show that gets audiences and the critics onside is cancelled. You sigh. You shrug. You move on to the next thing. But Top Boy was special to me. It was intensely personal. It was hard to let go. We discussed trying to make a movie. There was talk of doing it as a musical. But in the end, we accepted that was that. Time to move on. Three years ago, Charles called me to tell me that a Canadian singer had seen the show and wanted to help get it up again. In showbusiness, lots of people express interest in lots of things. \u201cI\u2019m excited\u201d is a much-mimicked showbiz line. I didn\u2019t pay much attention. But some months later, Charles called again to say that the singer was in town and wanted to meet. Molly and Finn asked where I was going. To meet some singer called Drake. \u201cWhat?! How do you know Drake?\u201d I Googled him quickly. Turns out he\u2019s big. In person, Drake is a humble man. He and his manager-partner, Future, simply said they loved the show and they wanted to do whatever they could to get it up and running again. We want to be gasoline to your fire, Future said. We decided on an approach to Netflix. At the pitch, Drake was passionate about why the show had to be brought back: there is nothing else on television like it. It shows a world that is ignored. Young people \u2013 white and black and everything in between \u2013 identified with it. We gathered the old Top Boy team and added some new faces. Daniel West came on to the writing team. Dave Omoregie, better known as the rapper Dave, joined the cast, along with Little Simz, Micheal Ward, Jasmine Jobson, Saffron Hocking, Lisa Dwan and a host of brilliant young unknowns that Des found for us. One of the new team was Reinaldo Marcus Green, who made the astonishing Monsters and Men. Rei came on to direct the first block of three episodes.

However, economists believe Javid will wait for a full budget to reveal specific details here.</p> <h2>Fiscal rules</h2> <p>The measures announced so far won\u2019t come cheap. As a result, Javid risks breaking a commitment not to raise public borrowing above limits set out in the Conservative manifesto. The chancellor said last week there would be no \u201cblank cheque\u201d for departments and that he would stay within the fiscal rules set by his predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\" title=\"\">Philip Hammond</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The economy has slumped to the brink of recession and public borrowing has risen over recent months</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Javid is bound by the rules to keep public debt falling as a percentage of GDP and to ensure borrowing, adjusted for the state of the economy, is below 2% of GDP in 2020-21. The self-imposed rules also call for the government to bring the public finances into balance by the mid-2020s \u2013 a promise economists say will be almost impossible to keep.</p> <p>Javid probably has headroom of about \u00a314bn to stay within the rules, based on the latest forecasts from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/office-for-budget-responsibility\" title=\"\">Office for Budget Responsibility</a>, made in March.</p> <p>Critics say the chancellor could avoid scrutiny by basing his plans on those forecasts. There will be no update to the forecasts on Wednesday and no new estimates until the next budget, the date of which is yet to be announced.</p> <p>The economy has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/28/uk-economy-falters-as-slowing-global-growth-adds-to-recession-risk\" title=\"\">slumped to the brink of recession</a>, with negative growth in the second quarter, and public borrowing has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/21/government-exceed-budget-target-this-year-extra-spending\" title=\"\">risen over recent months</a>, meaning any new forecast would slash the headroom for new spending.

Spending on justice, local government services and 16-18 further education are all currently about a fifth below 2010 levels and would require huge spending increases to reverse. Labour has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/chancellor-sajid-javid-fast-tracked-spending-review-fuels-talk-of-early-election\" title=\"\">voiced scepticism</a> that the chancellor will do enough to end austerity, calling the spending round a \u201cone-off pre-election panic-driven stunt budget\u201d.</p> <p>Benefits have been frozen for the past four years and the government has not said what its plans here are.</p>",

The chancellor said last week there would be no \u201cblank cheque\u201d for departments and that he would stay within the fiscal rules set by his predecessor, Philip Hammond. Javid is bound by the rules to keep public debt falling as a percentage of GDP and to ensure borrowing, adjusted for the state of the economy, is below 2% of GDP in 2020-21. The self-imposed rules also call for the government to bring the public finances into balance by the mid-2020s \u2013 a promise economists say will be almost impossible to keep. Javid probably has headroom of about \u00a314bn to stay within the rules, based on the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, made in March. Critics say the chancellor could avoid scrutiny by basing his plans on those forecasts. There will be no update to the forecasts on Wednesday and no new estimates until the next budget, the date of which is yet to be announced. The economy has slumped to the brink of recession, with negative growth in the second quarter, and public borrowing has risen over recent months, meaning any new forecast would slash the headroom for new spending. The March forecast also presumed a deal would be struck with Brussels, which now looks increasingly unlikely. The Resolution Foundation thinktank says at least \u00a310bn of headroom could be erased by accounting for the latest developments in the economy \u2013 meaning Javid could smash apart the rules in short order. Ending austerity Javid is likely to use the spending round to declare that a decade of austerity is coming to an end. This could mark the first time since 2007 that overall government spending has risen faster than inflation, giving him a basis to justify that message. Critics say the increase will not be enough to reverse cuts imposed since 2010, while some departments could still miss out. Spending on justice, local government services and 16-18 further education are all currently about a fifth below 2010 levels and would require huge spending increases to reverse. Labour has voiced scepticism that the chancellor will do enough to end austerity, calling the spending round a \u201cone-off pre-election panic-driven stunt budget\u201d. Benefits have been frozen for the past four years and the government has not said what its plans here are.",

Plenty of flogged-too-hard, dead-behind-the-eyes pop stars thank their fans in a familiar neutral, obligatory tone. But Styles has an analytic eye for the people who made him. \u201cThey have that bullshit detector,\u201d he said of his teenage girl audience. \u201cThey\u2019re the people who listen obsessively... they\u2019re running it.\u201d With that and his services to promoting your nan\u2019s headgear, it is difficult not to love him.</p> <h2>Emma Hayes: who would be a football manager?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"997d1c1f07b98daae3a4a08230286f20d34f0989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/997d1c1f07b98daae3a4a08230286f20d34f0989/0_119_3622_2173/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Hayes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Hayes: \u2018I was not at my best last season.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chelsea Football Club/Chelsea FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the new Women\u2019s Super League season kicks off, the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, talked to the <em>Evening Standard</em> about <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea/chelsea-manager-emma-hayes-clears-her-mind-for-title-charge-after-challenging-first-season-as-a4224246.html\" title=\"\">what went wrong last year</a>.</p> <p>Her team finished 2018-19 without a trophy, losing to Lyon in the Champions League semi-finals and finishing third in the WSL, behind Arsenal and Manchester City. \u201cI was not at my best last season and I understand even more how tough it is for working mums,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She gave birth to her son in May 2018, and went on to explain the impact on her work. \u201cI have never experienced sleep deprivation like that before.

In admitting that she might have been off her game last season because she had been up all night with a newborn, she made a simple and crucial point: women and men may have to deal with experiences distinct and unique to them when it comes to professional sport.

Excessive caution will surely be par for the course now and there\u2019s nothing like having to say \u201cit\u2019s a joke\u201d after a joke to kill a joke. But what really stuck in the throat was the faux outrage of those claiming to be offended by it. They weren\u2019t offended by it, not a bit. They pretended this was a world in which the host of The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice could be Che Guevara. They manufactured hurt feelings to gain political ground, which is a snowflake move if ever there was one. This deliberate false offence popped up again last week, when Philip Pullman tweeted: \u201cWhen I hear the name \u2018Boris Johnson\u2019, for some reason the words \u2018rope\u2019 and \u2018nearest lamp-post\u2019 come to mind as well.\u201d Upon mostly well-intentioned advice from some of his followers, he deleted it, admitting to \u201ca tactical error\u201d, but was forced to clarify that he was angry and not literally calling for Johnson to be hanged. It was in poor taste, but no one thought he was advocating murder; it is a smarmy lie to claim otherwise. What a world this is, when comedians and authors exaggerate and we pretend to take them seriously, then argue about what we pretended in the first place, as if it had nothing to do with us. Harry Styles: hats off to the prince of pop Harry Styles is on the cover of the latest Rolling Stone magazine, grinning like someone who has just realised that he is Harry Styles, a man so confident in his own visual appeal that he could easily embrace the Outward Bound via Are You Being Served? aesthetic of the accompanying photoshoot. Only he could get away with a peacock feather fascinator. In the interview, Styles reveals tidbits of information about himself: he did mushrooms, he lost his favourite yellow corduroy trousers while on mushrooms and he was so obsessed with the dulcimer on Joni Mitchell\u2019s Blue that he tracked down the woman who made it and got her to make him one too, which is certainly a more niche way of using one\u2019s wealth than splurging on a yacht or private jet. Styles also explained his consistent respect for his fans. Plenty of flogged-too-hard, dead-behind-the-eyes pop stars thank their fans in a familiar neutral, obligatory tone. But Styles has an analytic eye for the people who made him. \u201cThey have that bullshit detector,\u201d he said of his teenage girl audience. \u201cThey\u2019re the people who listen obsessively... they\u2019re running it.\u201d With that and his services to promoting your nan\u2019s headgear, it is difficult not to love him. Emma Hayes: who would be a football manager? As the new Women\u2019s Super League season kicks off, the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, talked to the Evening Standard about what went wrong last year. Her team finished 2018-19 without a trophy, losing to Lyon in the Champions League semi-finals and finishing third in the WSL, behind Arsenal and Manchester City. \u201cI was not at my best last season and I understand even more how tough it is for working mums,\u201d she said. She gave birth to her son in May 2018, and went on to explain the impact on her work. \u201cI have never experienced sleep deprivation like that before. That was excruciating, when [you are] breastfeeding and you are up all night, then you have to get up and go to work for a full day, operating on maybe two hours\u2019 sleep, on a regular basis.\u201d Hayes\u2019s candour was as brilliantly casual as it was unusual. In admitting that she might have been off her game last season because she had been up all night with a newborn, she made a simple and crucial point: women and men may have to deal with experiences distinct and unique to them when it comes to professional sport. Not always, but sometimes, and it should be discussed openly. To talk about differences as well as similarities, weaknesses as well as strengths, nudges everyone forward in the right direction. Without wishing to place all women\u2019s experiences into one cosy box of sisterhood, I was reminded of Heather Watson explaining a poor performance at the Australian Open because she was on her period. She was hailed then as \u201cbreaking the last taboo\u201d for women\u2019s sport, but there is still work to do and the work keeps being done. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

Beaten to pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix by Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc, Hamilton did well to take third, behind Sebastian Vettel after the British driver made a hugely uncharacteristic error in final practice and crashed out.</p> \n<p>Any celebrations were short-lived, however, after the major accident in the F2 race immediately afterwards, which resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/31/spa-f2-race-abandoned-antoine-hubert-juan-manuel-correa-crash\" title=\"\">death of the French driver Anthoine Hubert</a> and the abandonment of that race.</p> \n<p>The tragedy will overshadow whatever happens in the Formula One race but earlier Leclerc had been rightly thrilled at his first pole at Spa-Francorchamps and he deserved to revel in his achievement.

He remained optimistic however that he could challenge in the race despite Ferrari\u2019s apparent advantage.</p> \n<p>In stark contrast Leclerc had been absolutely on it, all weekend, quickest in two of the three practice sessions and all three periods of qualifying. He had the measure of the circuit to such an extent that he was almost untouchable.

The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart\" title=\"\">Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a> (Dart) is designed to smash headlong into its target. It\u2019s an attempt to deflect an asteroid as a test of what to do if we spot a similar space rock on a collision course with our planet.</p> <p>It\u2019s hardly news we want to hear at a time of so many domestic problems, but the threat from near-Earth asteroids is just one of a string of dangers that the planet and its technology are facing from space. Explosions on the sun create \u201cspace weather\u201d that can play havoc with our satellites and other electrical systems, while the growing amount of space debris imperils the satellites that we all invisibly rely on.</p> <p>The truth is our way of life utterly relies on space. The UK government now classes space as one of the nation\u2019s 13 critical infrastructure sectors. And it needs protecting.</p> <p>This November, science ministers from the various countries that belong to the European Space Agency (Esa) will gather in Seville, Spain, to decide the agency\u2019s funding and priorities for the next three years. Attending the meeting is not something that depends on Brexit. Esa is an independent organisation from the EU, and the UK has every intention of staying a member no matter what happens on 31 October. Included in that will be the creation of a comprehensive \u20ac200m a year programme of planetary defence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One spacecraft hits the asteroid, the\u00a0other\u00a0measures what happens. Nasa and Esa collaborate to split the cost</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If approved, it would begin with a mission called Hera. This would investigate the aftermath of Nasa\u2019s Dart impact, collecting enough data to turn the impact test into a workable asteroid defence programme. And that\u2019s not all. </p> <p>Called <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Safety\" title=\"\">Space Safety</a>, the programme also proposes missions to warn us against space weather and begin the removal of space debris. \u201cAll threats are viewed as equally important,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2017/04/Holger_Krag\" title=\"\">Holger Krag</a>, head of the programme.</p> <p>But that might not be the view of the various member countries, where funding is likely to be limited. If the full \u20ac200m is not forthcoming, ministers will have to decide which threats to tackle and which ones to simply cross our fingers over.</p> <p>The choices are:</p> <h2><strong>Near-Earth asteroids</strong> </h2> <p>On Thursday 25 July, an asteroid 57-130 metres across missed our planet by just one-fifth of the distance to the moon. In astronomical terms, that\u2019s a hair\u2019s breadth. Had it hit us, the devastation would have been staggering.</p> <p>Astronomers call asteroids of this size \u201ccity killers\u201d. It\u2019s not hard to see why. In February 2013, one roughly 20 metres across appeared in the sky above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk.

When the space race began, the US and Russia blasted rockets into orbit willy-nilly. As other nations started building their own satellites, they too launched at random. No one cared about what happened to the spacecraft after the mission ended because, as Douglas Adams wrote: \u201cSpace is big.\u201d</p> <p>It turns out that while Adams is right about the universe as a whole, the orbits around the Earth are not inexhaustible. There are now well over an estimated million pieces of space debris larger than 1 centimetre in orbit around Earth. Each one has the potential to collide with and destroy another satellite, creating hundreds of thousands more pieces of space debris.</p> <p>Around half the debris in space today comes from just two incidents. The 2007 anti-satellite test in which China blew up a satellite of its own with a missile and an accidental collision in 2009 between a defunct Russian satellite and a working US one.</p> <p>Space engineers talk about the Kessler syndrome, a nightmare scenario which envisages so much space debris being generated that we simply cannot put more satellites into orbit. Any we did launch would be destroyed by random collisions, creating more space debris and making the situation worse. Averting the Kessler syndrome is something Esa has been thinking about for a long time.</p> <p>\u201cWe were one of the first agencies together with Nasa to highlight this problem,\u201d says Holger Krag.</p> <p>But progress has been slow, partly because the law is extremely lax about littering space. Now, however, as part of the proposed Space Safety programme, Esa thinks it has found a way to get the ball rolling. The idea is simple.</p> <p>First, it demonstrates that removing space debris is possible. Then it lobbies for international space law to be changed to say that a satellite\u2019s owner must de-orbit the craft at the end of its mission. If the owner fails to do this, they have to pay an industrial contractor to go and remove the satellite for them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Elon Musk\u2019s plan is to launch 12,000 tiny satellites in\u00a0very low orbits; other companies envisage similar\u00a0fleets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat would automatically generate a market. And that\u2019s what we want to prepare for,\u201d says Krag.</p> <p>So the mission Esa envisages for this strand of the Space Safety programme is different from the other two. Instead of specifying the details of how the mission should complete its task, it wants industry to come up with those ideas. Esa will then lend its expertise to help develop the necessary technology but industry will own the missions.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope to break the cycle between legislators waiting for de-orbit technology to be available and the law that is not yet tight enough to enable this market to begin,\u201d says Krag.</p> <p>As well as the debris that is already up there, the proposed mega-constellation of hundreds or thousands of small satellites only makes the problem more urgent.<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2204394-spacex-is-launching-60-satellites-to-start-its-global-internet-scheme/\" title=\"\"> Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX plan is to launch 12,000 tiny satellites </a>into very low orbits to supply low-latency telecommunications; other companies are planning similar fleets.

      "bodyText": "Next year, Nasa will launch what all involved hope will be the most impactful space mission to date. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (Dart) is designed to smash headlong into its target. It\u2019s an attempt to deflect an asteroid as a test of what to do if we spot a similar space rock on a collision course with our planet. It\u2019s hardly news we want to hear at a time of so many domestic problems, but the threat from near-Earth asteroids is just one of a string of dangers that the planet and its technology are facing from space. Explosions on the sun create \u201cspace weather\u201d that can play havoc with our satellites and other electrical systems, while the growing amount of space debris imperils the satellites that we all invisibly rely on. The truth is our way of life utterly relies on space. The UK government now classes space as one of the nation\u2019s 13 critical infrastructure sectors. And it needs protecting. This November, science ministers from the various countries that belong to the European Space Agency (Esa) will gather in Seville, Spain, to decide the agency\u2019s funding and priorities for the next three years. Attending the meeting is not something that depends on Brexit. Esa is an independent organisation from the EU, and the UK has every intention of staying a member no matter what happens on 31 October. Included in that will be the creation of a comprehensive \u20ac200m a year programme of planetary defence. If approved, it would begin with a mission called Hera. This would investigate the aftermath of Nasa\u2019s Dart impact, collecting enough data to turn the impact test into a workable asteroid defence programme. And that\u2019s not all. Called Space Safety, the programme also proposes missions to warn us against space weather and begin the removal of space debris. \u201cAll threats are viewed as equally important,\u201d says Holger Krag, head of the programme. But that might not be the view of the various member countries, where funding is likely to be limited. If the full \u20ac200m is not forthcoming, ministers will have to decide which threats to tackle and which ones to simply cross our fingers over. The choices are: Near-Earth asteroids On Thursday 25 July, an asteroid 57-130 metres across missed our planet by just one-fifth of the distance to the moon. In astronomical terms, that\u2019s a hair\u2019s breadth. Had it hit us, the devastation would have been staggering. Astronomers call asteroids of this size \u201ccity killers\u201d. It\u2019s not hard to see why. In February 2013, one roughly 20 metres across appeared in the sky above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. It exploded at an altitude of around 30 kilometres, creating a shockwave that shattered windows and injured around 1,500 people. What makes the asteroid of 25 July so disturbing is that if it had appeared over Chelyabinsk, instead of breaking windows, it would have toppled whole buildings. But there\u2019s hope. \u201cWe are the first generation of life on the Earth that can actually do something about this risk,\u201d says Krag. In the early 2000s, Esa convened a panel of experts to assess how best to deal with an incoming asteroid. The ideas they looked at ranged from the bizarre \u2013 painting an asteroid so that the way it reflected light would gradually shift its orbit \u2013 to the frightening \u2013 repurposing nuclear weapons to melt part of the asteroid so that the heat it released would push the rock into a different orbit. The team came to the conclusion that the most viable option was the so-called kinetic impactor. In other words, you drive headfirst into the asteroid and knock it out of the way. Prof Alan Fitzsimmons of Queen\u2019s University Belfast was part of that original team. \u201cThe best thing we can do at the moment to protect the Earth is search for these objects and find them, study their physical properties so that we know what\u2019s likely to hit us and see if we can move one,\u201d he says.

      "body": "<p>Most predictions about the future of artificial intelligence suggest two possibilities: AI will either make us immortal or it will hasten our extinction. <em>Aniara</em> posits a third option: the unredeemable awfulness of humanity drives an artificial intelligence to suicide. From the country that gave us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a> comes a staggering sci-fi eco parable set on a transport ship from a scorched Earth to a dormitory settlement on Mars. <em>Aniara</em> (the name comes from an ancient Greek word meaning \u201cdespairing\u201d) is based on a 1956 epic poem from the Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson and explores the end of humanity in capsule form. And when we go, according to this wildly ambitious debut feature from writing and directing team Pella K\u00e5german and Hugo Lilja, it will be not with a bang but with a mindless plod of consumerism, a flailing grasp for meaning and the occasional space orgy.</p> <p>One of many massive ships used to ferry the remains of the human race (or at least those lucky enough to buy a chance of a new life) from Earth to Mars, the Aniara is essentially a galactic shopping mall. It\u2019s like the ship from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/20/animation.conservation\" title=\"\"><em>WALL-E</em></a> viewed through the prism of Tarkovsky\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/solaris-tarkovsky-science-fiction\" title=\"\"><em>Solaris</em></a>.</p> <p>On board is a virtual-reality AI therapy room called the Mima, run by MR (Emelie Jonsson). At first the passengers prefer to trawl around the endless retail options. But when a freak collision with some space junk sends the ship off course, the passengers turn to the Mima, which becomes a valuable resource. And like all of Earth\u2019s resources, it\u2019s plundered. A haunting allegorical tale, <em>Aniara</em> warns of humanity hurtling in the wrong direction and realising too late that there is no turning back.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lG41Q_5DrA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-lG41Q_5DrA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lG41Q_5DrA\">Watch a trailer for Aniara.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Most predictions about the future of artificial intelligence suggest two possibilities: AI will either make us immortal or it will hasten our extinction. Aniara posits a third option: the unredeemable awfulness of humanity drives an artificial intelligence to suicide. From the country that gave us Greta Thunberg comes a staggering sci-fi eco parable set on a transport ship from a scorched Earth to a dormitory settlement on Mars. Aniara (the name comes from an ancient Greek word meaning \u201cdespairing\u201d) is based on a 1956 epic poem from the Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson and explores the end of humanity in capsule form. And when we go, according to this wildly ambitious debut feature from writing and directing team Pella K\u00e5german and Hugo Lilja, it will be not with a bang but with a mindless plod of consumerism, a flailing grasp for meaning and the occasional space orgy. One of many massive ships used to ferry the remains of the human race (or at least those lucky enough to buy a chance of a new life) from Earth to Mars, the Aniara is essentially a galactic shopping mall. It\u2019s like the ship from WALL-E viewed through the prism of Tarkovsky\u2019s Solaris. On board is a virtual-reality AI therapy room called the Mima, run by MR (Emelie Jonsson). At first the passengers prefer to trawl around the endless retail options. But when a freak collision with some space junk sends the ship off course, the passengers turn to the Mima, which becomes a valuable resource. And like all of Earth\u2019s resources, it\u2019s plundered. A haunting allegorical tale, Aniara warns of humanity hurtling in the wrong direction and realising too late that there is no turning back.",

It was a deliberate political policy to create this legend, to say here is the enemy, we kicked them out and now France is French; it\u2019s our country. Even if we know history isn\u2019t quite that simple, it has become the cement holding our nation together.\u201d</p> <p>In the film, we see Carle out with members from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ARMforUK/\" title=\"\">Active Resistance to Metrication</a>, whose undercover late-night operations involve changing road signs from metres and kilometres to yards and miles.</p> <p>\u201cThey were mostly older men, Brexiters who said the English had used their own system for ever and they didn\u2019t see why it had to change. They were real rebels, but ultra-polite and correct and very precise about how they pasted their stickers,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9642aaabdb984d81f178073147b2bd07c2e72b1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9642aaabdb984d81f178073147b2bd07c2e72b1f/237_190_3314_5175/640.jpg\" alt=\"Marmite?

When I mentioned the risks or asked if people were worried, they said: \u2018It\u2019s OK, there\u2019s time.\u2019 And there were no demonstrations. That surprised me, but I\u2019m a bit English in that way. I complain about things afterwards,\u201d he says.</p> <p>So what did Carle like, dislike and not understand after his journey of discovery among the people the French love to hate?</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like that people found it impossible to say no. They wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018No, sorry, I don\u2019t want to be interviewed by you\u2019, they\u2019d make excuses. Just say no,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there were the constant references to the French being \u2018cowards\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cI liked the absence of harassment of women in the streets; France has a lot to learn here. And I liked English jokes like: how do you plant an English lawn? You sow the seeds and wait for it to rain for 600 years.\u201d</p> <p>The food? \u201cHmm, people kept saying it has improved, but to be honest, I didn\u2019t find it that good. Jellied eels that manage to be both salty and tasteless, meat pies with gelatinous parsley sauces, and cutting afternoon tea cakes into small pieces. What\u2019s that about?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People couldn\u2019t say no ... and there were constant references to the French being 'cowards'</p> <footer> <cite>Benjamin Carle</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And Marmite? (In the documentary, Carle is seen pasting a thick layer of the yeast-extract spread over his toast.) \u201cNon, non, <em>non</em>,\u201d he grimaces. \u201cWhy do you eat this thing? Is it something that\u2019s part of your heritage that you just can\u2019t let go of?</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, I think the English are more open to the world and know France better than the French know the English. And that means they like us more. Sometimes we French are very self-satisfied and smug; we think we know England because we have visited London for the weekend, but we know very little about the English.</p> <p>\u201cBefore I made this film, I would have said I was 25 to 30% English. Now, although I feel more French, I have a greater respect for the English, because I realise I\u2019m not one of them. Today, I feel 10% English.\u201d</p> <p>And that, he says, is a good thing. <em>Vive la diff\u00e9rence!</em></p>",

We don\u2019t need to all have the same cultural identity.\u201d Carle\u2019s documentary, to be aired on Canal+ in September, opens at a re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings won by William the Conqueror in 1066. \u201cI discovered it\u2019s such an important date in England, but relatively little known in France, perhaps because William was Norman and France wasn\u2019t a unified country back then. \u201cWe went back through the history books and calculated that in roughly 1,000 years of history there have been a total of 250 years of war in 30 conflicts between France and England and millions of deaths, most of them, unlike Hastings, outside of England.\u201d Carle suggests the roots of the current love-hate relationship between France and England dates back to Joan of Arc in the 15th century. \u201cWe learn in school to thank Jeanne d\u2019Arc for kicking the English out of France. It was a deliberate political policy to create this legend, to say here is the enemy, we kicked them out and now France is French; it\u2019s our country. Even if we know history isn\u2019t quite that simple, it has become the cement holding our nation together.\u201d In the film, we see Carle out with members from the Active Resistance to Metrication, whose undercover late-night operations involve changing road signs from metres and kilometres to yards and miles. \u201cThey were mostly older men, Brexiters who said the English had used their own system for ever and they didn\u2019t see why it had to change. They were real rebels, but ultra-polite and correct and very precise about how they pasted their stickers,\u201d he says. Carle says he didn\u2019t want to make a programme focused on Brexit, but he was surprised by the casual attitude of the English towards their impending departure from the EU. \u201cI was there in the run-up to the original Brexit day in March. When I mentioned the risks or asked if people were worried, they said: \u2018It\u2019s OK, there\u2019s time.\u2019 And there were no demonstrations. That surprised me, but I\u2019m a bit English in that way. I complain about things afterwards,\u201d he says. So what did Carle like, dislike and not understand after his journey of discovery among the people the French love to hate? \u201cI didn\u2019t like that people found it impossible to say no. They wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018No, sorry, I don\u2019t want to be interviewed by you\u2019, they\u2019d make excuses. Just say no,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there were the constant references to the French being \u2018cowards\u2019. \u201cI liked the absence of harassment of women in the streets; France has a lot to learn here. And I liked English jokes like: how do you plant an English lawn? You sow the seeds and wait for it to rain for 600 years.\u201d The food? \u201cHmm, people kept saying it has improved, but to be honest, I didn\u2019t find it that good. Jellied eels that manage to be both salty and tasteless, meat pies with gelatinous parsley sauces, and cutting afternoon tea cakes into small pieces. What\u2019s that about?\u201d And Marmite? (In the documentary, Carle is seen pasting a thick layer of the yeast-extract spread over his toast.) \u201cNon, non, non,\u201d he grimaces. \u201cWhy do you eat this thing? Is it something that\u2019s part of your heritage that you just can\u2019t let go of? \u201cTo be honest, I think the English are more open to the world and know France better than the French know the English. And that means they like us more. Sometimes we French are very self-satisfied and smug; we think we know England because we have visited London for the weekend, but we know very little about the English. \u201cBefore I made this film, I would have said I was 25 to 30% English. Now, although I feel more French, I have a greater respect for the English, because I realise I\u2019m not one of them. Today, I feel 10% English.\u201d And that, he says, is a good thing. Vive la diff\u00e9rence!",

Asked about comments made by Keir Starmer about next week being the final opportunity to stop the UK from leaving the EU without an agreement, Corbyn said: \u201cYes, it is the last chance and we will do absolutely everything we can to prevent a no-deal Brexit and the prime minister taking us into the hands of Donald Trump and a trade deal with the USA. \u201cThat is the real agenda of the prime minister. There is a lot of work being done in preparation for next Tuesday.\u201d His comments came as it was reported that Boris Johnson is expected to stop Conservative MPs standing at the next election if they vote to block a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister is expected to treat next week\u2019s Commons votes as a no-confidence vote in his government, with rebel Conservatives to be disqualified from contesting their seats, the Sun reported. With parliament returning on Tuesday, Johnson is understood to be aiming to persuade some MPs not to rebel as he hopes to quell an attempt to introduce legislation through parliament to delay Brexit beyond 31 October. Protesters have taken to the streets across the country in response to Johnson\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament. Thousands of people gathered in George Square in the centre of Glasgow at a People\u2019s Assembly Defend Democracy rally against the prorogation of parliament. Corbyn is expected to be among the speakers, marking the end of his three-day visit to Scotland.",

I\u2019ve always been a perfectionist \u2013 I\u2019ll exhaust things until I feel happy. But over the years I\u2019ve realised there\u2019s a point where you have to pull back on that. I\u2019d still be messing around with <em>Born To Do It</em> if I had had my way \u2013 and that\u2019s nearly 20 years old.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve stopped taking </strong>fitness so seriously. There was a period when I\u2019d go to the gym twice a day. It\u2019s different now because it\u2019s just about staying healthy and keeping the body moving. I use my performances as my cardio.</p> <p><strong>Onstage I always feel</strong> like I can keep it together. In 2001 I did three nights at House of Blues in LA and every night I was starstruck. The first night Jennifer Lopez and Missy Elliott came. The following night it was Beyonc\u00e9. Then the third night I was singing Walking Away and I looked into the crowd and I could see Stevie Wonder singing along to it. That was a very surreal moment for me.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t live in a hotel</strong> any more. When I was living in Miami and coming over to the UK, I\u2019d stay in a hotel by the airport because it made sense. But hotel stays aren\u2019t healthy at the best of times, and any longer than a few days is really not the one. I\u2019m back grounded in a proper home now, which is good.</p> <p><strong>I used to think </strong>recognition came from winning awards. But now I realise the actual winning part is all smoke and mirrors. I feel like I\u2019m winning every day when someone comments and says: \u201cThis song changed my life.\u201d There is no award that\u2019s ever going to give you that feeling. I live off that now.</p> <p><strong>I have 100% forgiven </strong>Leigh Francis for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/30/when-good-tv-goes-bad-bo-selecta\" title=\"\">Bo\u2019 Selecta!</a> If you hold on to things and ask the question, \u201cWhy did it happen?\u201d it\u2019s like you\u2019re drinking your own poison. You have to forgive people, and the situation, and also look at what came from it. In a roundabout way, that period of time made me ask a lot of questions about what direction I was going in. Music isn\u2019t a hobby for me. It wasn\u2019t like I was going, \u201cI\u2019ve had a good innings, let me tap out now.\u201d It made space for me to come back. It was a blessing in disguise in a weird way.</p> <p><strong>Celebrity culture</strong> plays its part in society. But I see it from a slightly different place, too \u2013 I feel for people who are sold the dream. I almost want to give them a big hug and tell them to be ready for when it stops. I\u2019m really conscious when I see shows like <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\" title=\"\">Love Island</a></em> that there\u2019s a good support system around that doesn\u2019t allow them to inflate too much. I genuinely worry because we\u2019re all part of gassing people up, but then when it goes quiet, where\u2019s everyone then?</p> <p><strong>I was 16 when </strong>I wrote 7 Days, and I was still living at home in my mum\u2019s house, so it wasn\u2019t like I was living the life. On it I even sing, \u201cWe were making love\u201d, so it wasn\u2019t like we were doing a whole load of craziness. I was playing these songs around my mum so I could never be vulgar. But with the right person sex becomes more than a primal experience. There\u2019s a whole different level and elevation of sex if you\u2019re with someone you really love and care for. That\u2019s when it excels and moves into another place. </p> <p><em>Craig David\u2019s new single, Do You Miss Me Much, is out now</em></p>",

I feel like I\u2019m winning every day when someone comments and says: \u201cThis song changed my life.\u201d There is no award that\u2019s ever going to give you that feeling. I live off that now. I have 100% forgiven Leigh Francis for Bo\u2019 Selecta! If you hold on to things and ask the question, \u201cWhy did it happen?\u201d it\u2019s like you\u2019re drinking your own poison. You have to forgive people, and the situation, and also look at what came from it. In a roundabout way, that period of time made me ask a lot of questions about what direction I was going in. Music isn\u2019t a hobby for me. It wasn\u2019t like I was going, \u201cI\u2019ve had a good innings, let me tap out now.\u201d It made space for me to come back. It was a blessing in disguise in a weird way. Celebrity culture plays its part in society. But I see it from a slightly different place, too \u2013 I feel for people who are sold the dream. I almost want to give them a big hug and tell them to be ready for when it stops. I\u2019m really conscious when I see shows like Love Island that there\u2019s a good support system around that doesn\u2019t allow them to inflate too much. I genuinely worry because we\u2019re all part of gassing people up, but then when it goes quiet, where\u2019s everyone then? I was 16 when I wrote 7 Days, and I was still living at home in my mum\u2019s house, so it wasn\u2019t like I was living the life. On it I even sing, \u201cWe were making love\u201d, so it wasn\u2019t like we were doing a whole load of craziness. I was playing these songs around my mum so I could never be vulgar. But with the right person sex becomes more than a primal experience. There\u2019s a whole different level and elevation of sex if you\u2019re with someone you really love and care for. That\u2019s when it excels and moves into another place. Craig David\u2019s new single, Do You Miss Me Much, is out now",

      "bodyText": "Nope, it\u2019s not somewhere you\u2019d end up on a wild out in Benidorm: O\u2019Flynn is the alias of electronic music producer Ben Norris, purveyor of nimble, globetrotting house and disco jams. Since 2015, when James Blake played his track Oberyn on Radio 1, O\u2019Flynn has been steadily releasing low-key secret weapons in DJs\u2019 record bags. There\u2019s Tyrion \u2013 inspired by the percussion he heard while on holiday in Morocco \u2013 which Four Tet dropped in a set on the streaming site Boiler Room. Or TKOTN, included by Bonobo on his mix for London nightclub Fabric\u2019s esteemed compilation series. O\u2019Flynn\u2019s music flits between contemporary takes on the Afro-disco revival and even, as on his recent Ninja Tune release, acid house. It calls into question the ease with which (largely white, usually male) music producers are using African samples (a children\u2019s chant; a polyrhythmic drum beat) for some quick \u201cexotic\u201d flavour. But O\u2019Flynn does it rather seamlessly, like a boogie-fied Auntie Flo. He has said his passion for African music runs deep and, in 2016, he was involved in recording the mataali drum and vocal troupe Mubashira Mataali Group in Uganda. O\u2019Flynn\u2019s debut album, Aletheia, is out just in time for the end of summer, and owes more to Four Tet\u2019s style of \u201cworld-club dream music\u201d \u2013 as described by Kitty Empire in these pages \u2013 all sparkling harp and downtempo beats. But there are touches, too, of Todd Terje-style cosmic disco parping and plenty more besides. Grab your passport and get onboard. Aletheia is released on 6 September on Silver Bear. O\u2019Flynn tours the UK from 16 September",

      "body": "<p>Nearly 40% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, to use a figure architects love to bandy, are caused by the built environment. Or a bit more, depending on the definitions used. It\u2019s an arresting figure. It suggests that the design of buildings and the planning of cities can do much to counter climate crisis. </p> <p>Architects like to think of themselves as public-spirited, well-intentioned people. The profession tends to attract people who want to change the world for the better. And what could matter more than the prevention of environmental and societal collapse? It makes squabbles about architectural style or form seem trivial by comparison. So what would architecture look like \u2013 more importantly, what would it be \u2013 if all involved really and truly put climate at the centre of their concerns? Would there be no more concrete, given the material has been fingered as particularly destructive? Or an end to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/21/councils-powers-to-remove-grenfell-style-cladding-useless\" title=\"\">towers clad in panels</a> that have to be replaced every 30 years? Or much less building altogether?</p> <p>It is a question raised earlier this year by the launch of <a href=\"https://www.architectsdeclare.com/\" title=\"\">Architects Declare</a>, in which <a href=\"https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/seventeen-stirling-prize-winners-unite-to-declare-climate-emergency/10042794.article\" title=\"\">17 winners of the Stirling prize</a> proclaimed a set of principles by which they and \u2013 they hoped \u2013 others would from now on work, and by the debate that followed. How serious could these architects really be, went one of the reactions, given that a number of them are designing major airports? A more radical version of the question will be put by the young curators of the <a href=\"http://oslotriennale.no/en/\" title=\"\">Oslo Architecture Trienn</a><a href=\"http://oslotriennale.no/en/\" title=\"\">ale</a>, Maria Smith, Phin Harper, Cecilie Sachs Olsen and Matthew Dalziel, which opens later this month. \u201cJust fiddling around with what the market gives us is not enough,\u201d says Harper.</p> <p>What is considered sustainable differs wildly depending on who you ask. <a href=\"https://www.worldgbc.org/\" title=\"\">The World Green Building Council</a>, an organisation supported by members from the construction industry, holds up the seemingly surprising example of <a href=\"https://www.barangaroo.com/\" title=\"\">Barangaroo</a>, a huge high-rise development on the Sydney waterfront. Harper and Smith cite traditional earth-building techniques and ingenious experiments in building structures without cement or steel. Somewhere in between is a building like the Stirling prize-shortlisted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/28/cork-house-review-eton-stirling-prize-matthew-barnett-howland-dido-milne-oliver-wilton\" title=\"\">Cork House in Eton</a>, about which nobody has a bad word to say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eb05c5d0b02056558d5a675055c0770e64e894df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb05c5d0b02056558d5a675055c0770e64e894df/0_0_4961_3297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Stirling prize-shortlisted Cork House in Eton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Stirling prize-shortlisted Cork House in Eton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricky Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The argument of Architects Declare \u2013 which might be called the sensible middle ground \u2013 goes something like this: architects (and for that matter contractors, clients, engineers and everyone else involved in making buildings) have no excuse for not giving their utmost to make their work have as little impact on the environment as possible. They have to consider everything \u2013 how far stone might have to travel from quarry to site, for example, and whether or not a building\u2019s components will end up as landfill when it is demolished.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/28/cork-house-review-eton-stirling-prize-matthew-barnett-howland-dido-milne-oliver-wilton\">Cork House review \u2013 barking up the right tree</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is not enough to reduce what are called the \u201cin-use\u201d costs \u2013 heating, ventilation, lighting, water, waste, maintenance \u2013 but also the \u201cembodied energy\u201d that goes into construction and demolition: quarrying cement, smelting steel, firing bricks, shipping materials to site, putting them in place, taking them down again and disposing of them. Until recently the construction industry has concentrated on in-use costs. The British building regulations, for example, set reasonably high standards for the performance of buildings, but are silent on embodied energy. This makes no sense \u2013 there\u2019s little point building something that performs magnificently in use, if it takes decades or centuries to pay back the expenditure of energy that went into its construction.</p> <p>Painful choices may be required \u2013 giving up some dearly beloved brutalist-style concrete or a favourite brick. It might mean some genuinely difficult dilemmas: concrete, if used right, slows the rates at which a building cools down and warms up (good) but is made with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/25/concrete-is-tipping-us-into-climate-catastrophe-its-payback-time-cement-tax\" title=\"\">cement</a>, a material that singlehandedly accounts for about 8% of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions (not good).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It should be possible to make a humble kitchen extension using materials dug up from the ground around it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sustainable design shouldn\u2019t be seen as just a technical fix, a matter of paying the right consultant enough money to make sure the building ticks enough boxes, or of buying the most magical available piece of cooling technology. It should rather be integrated into the art of architecture. The ideal is that it should help buildings be all round better, longer-lasting, more pleasurable, more beautiful \u2013 \u201cgenerosity, quality of materials, what people want \u2013 it kind of makes them endure\u201d is how Alison Brooks, one of the Architects Declare signatories puts it. It could mean more natural stone, more timber. This is why the Cork House appeals \u2013 its material is lovely stuff, which also happens to be renewable, recyclable and highly insulating.</p> <p>Slightly more radically, the architectural profession needs to reconsider its value systems, what is considered good and what bad. Architects are still trained from studenthood to perform in what Steve Tompkins, one of the driving forces behind Architects Declare, calls a \u201ccompetitive and individualistic profession\u201d. They get more glory for designing a singular new building than they would if they worked out a good way of insulating old houses. Yet, as most of the building stock of the future is already with us, and as demolition and rebuilding entails the chucking away of whatever went into making the original building, the latter is likely to be more useful than the former.</p> <p>All of which, if every architect pursued it with full commitment, would be a significant advance. This collection of good principles, however, doesn\u2019t answer the airport question, which highlights the limits on architects\u2019 powers: it is not up to them to decide how much air travel there is in the world, which leaves them with the choice of refusing the commission to design airport buildings, or helping them to be as \u201cgreen\u201d as they possibly can be. Grimshaw Architects, Foster and Partners and Zaha Hadid Architects, signatories of Architects Declare, have opted for the latter. They are working on terminals in Heathrow, Mexico City and Beijing, respectively.</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/central-saint-martins/people/jeremy-till-head-of-college\" title=\"\">Jeremy Till</a>, head of Central Saint Martins school of art and design, these architects\u2019 choice is a \u201cfarce.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t have a carbon-neutral airport,\u201d he says. Architects have to do more than be well-intentioned instruments of what he calls \u201can extractive industry.\u201d They have to be activists as well as designers.</p> <p>Maria Smith and Phin Harper believe drastic times call for drastic actions. If, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ipcc\" title=\"\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> said last autumn, there were only 12 years left to limit climate change catastrophe (make that 11, as nearly a year has passed since then), the conventional processes of architecture are too slow to make any difference. By the time a well-considered, carefully calculated development has successfully traded off the inputs and outputs that went into its construction, it will be too late. Rather the whole attitude to construction has to change now.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 40% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, to use a figure architects love to bandy, are caused by the built environment. Or a bit more, depending on the definitions used. It\u2019s an arresting figure. It suggests that the design of buildings and the planning of cities can do much to counter climate crisis. Architects like to think of themselves as public-spirited, well-intentioned people. The profession tends to attract people who want to change the world for the better. And what could matter more than the prevention of environmental and societal collapse? It makes squabbles about architectural style or form seem trivial by comparison. So what would architecture look like \u2013 more importantly, what would it be \u2013 if all involved really and truly put climate at the centre of their concerns? Would there be no more concrete, given the material has been fingered as particularly destructive? Or an end to towers clad in panels that have to be replaced every 30 years? Or much less building altogether? It is a question raised earlier this year by the launch of Architects Declare, in which 17 winners of the Stirling prize proclaimed a set of principles by which they and \u2013 they hoped \u2013 others would from now on work, and by the debate that followed. How serious could these architects really be, went one of the reactions, given that a number of them are designing major airports? A more radical version of the question will be put by the young curators of the Oslo Architecture Triennale, Maria Smith, Phin Harper, Cecilie Sachs Olsen and Matthew Dalziel, which opens later this month. \u201cJust fiddling around with what the market gives us is not enough,\u201d says Harper. What is considered sustainable differs wildly depending on who you ask. The World Green Building Council, an organisation supported by members from the construction industry, holds up the seemingly surprising example of Barangaroo, a huge high-rise development on the Sydney waterfront. Harper and Smith cite traditional earth-building techniques and ingenious experiments in building structures without cement or steel. Somewhere in between is a building like the Stirling prize-shortlisted Cork House in Eton, about which nobody has a bad word to say. The argument of Architects Declare \u2013 which might be called the sensible middle ground \u2013 goes something like this: architects (and for that matter contractors, clients, engineers and everyone else involved in making buildings) have no excuse for not giving their utmost to make their work have as little impact on the environment as possible. They have to consider everything \u2013 how far stone might have to travel from quarry to site, for example, and whether or not a building\u2019s components will end up as landfill when it is demolished. It is not enough to reduce what are called the \u201cin-use\u201d costs \u2013 heating, ventilation, lighting, water, waste, maintenance \u2013 but also the \u201cembodied energy\u201d that goes into construction and demolition: quarrying cement, smelting steel, firing bricks, shipping materials to site, putting them in place, taking them down again and disposing of them. Until recently the construction industry has concentrated on in-use costs. The British building regulations, for example, set reasonably high standards for the performance of buildings, but are silent on embodied energy. This makes no sense \u2013 there\u2019s little point building something that performs magnificently in use, if it takes decades or centuries to pay back the expenditure of energy that went into its construction. Painful choices may be required \u2013 giving up some dearly beloved brutalist-style concrete or a favourite brick. It might mean some genuinely difficult dilemmas: concrete, if used right, slows the rates at which a building cools down and warms up (good) but is made with cement, a material that singlehandedly accounts for about 8% of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions (not good). Sustainable design shouldn\u2019t be seen as just a technical fix, a matter of paying the right consultant enough money to make sure the building ticks enough boxes, or of buying the most magical available piece of cooling technology. It should rather be integrated into the art of architecture. The ideal is that it should help buildings be all round better, longer-lasting, more pleasurable, more beautiful \u2013 \u201cgenerosity, quality of materials, what people want \u2013 it kind of makes them endure\u201d is how Alison Brooks, one of the Architects Declare signatories puts it. It could mean more natural stone, more timber. This is why the Cork House appeals \u2013 its material is lovely stuff, which also happens to be renewable, recyclable and highly insulating. Slightly more radically, the architectural profession needs to reconsider its value systems, what is considered good and what bad. Architects are still trained from studenthood to perform in what Steve Tompkins, one of the driving forces behind Architects Declare, calls a \u201ccompetitive and individualistic profession\u201d. They get more glory for designing a singular new building than they would if they worked out a good way of insulating old houses. Yet, as most of the building stock of the future is already with us, and as demolition and rebuilding entails the chucking away of whatever went into making the original building, the latter is likely to be more useful than the former. All of which, if every architect pursued it with full commitment, would be a significant advance. This collection of good principles, however, doesn\u2019t answer the airport question, which highlights the limits on architects\u2019 powers: it is not up to them to decide how much air travel there is in the world, which leaves them with the choice of refusing the commission to design airport buildings, or helping them to be as \u201cgreen\u201d as they possibly can be. Grimshaw Architects, Foster and Partners and Zaha Hadid Architects, signatories of Architects Declare, have opted for the latter. They are working on terminals in Heathrow, Mexico City and Beijing, respectively. For Jeremy Till, head of Central Saint Martins school of art and design, these architects\u2019 choice is a \u201cfarce.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t have a carbon-neutral airport,\u201d he says. Architects have to do more than be well-intentioned instruments of what he calls \u201can extractive industry.\u201d They have to be activists as well as designers. Maria Smith and Phin Harper believe drastic times call for drastic actions. If, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last autumn, there were only 12 years left to limit climate change catastrophe (make that 11, as nearly a year has passed since then), the conventional processes of architecture are too slow to make any difference. By the time a well-considered, carefully calculated development has successfully traded off the inputs and outputs that went into its construction, it will be too late. Rather the whole attitude to construction has to change now. Which also requires the economic system behind it \u2013 that is to say, capitalism \u2013 to change. Their Triennale in Oslo, a series of displays and performances starting on 26 September, will apply to architecture the economic and political idea of degrowth \u2013 the beliefs that an alternative has to be found to the continuously rising GDPs that are fundamental to capitalist economies. For Smith and Harper it is about using resources that already exist and, rather than serving \u201cutilitarian goals of investment and profit\u201d, concentrating on \u201cwhat really makes life worth living\u201d. \u201cAll the ingredients for a good life exist somewhere in the world,\u201d they say \u2013 it\u2019s just a question of enabling everyone to have access to them. For architecture this might mean learning from indigenous building techniques based on using renewable materials close at hand, such as mud walls or thatch, enhanced with modern technology. Smith and Harper give as examples machines for making bricks out of mud, wall panels made of hemp and lime, materials made from compressed recycled denim or from ground-up pine needles mixed with pine resin. There is a technique for building columns by filling heavy duty fabric with sand or rubble. There is mycelium, a form of fungus that can be made into bricks. A practical example of this thinking is the Ilford community market, a project by Smith\u2019s practice, Interrobang, which is due to open next year. Here there will be no concrete foundations, but a timber structure stabilised by rocks in metal cages that can be demounted and reassembled with minimal waste or impact.

Absolutely,\u201d says Ward, who has done a remarkable job in London.

Agar says: \u201cI\u2019m not studying other fixtures, but given our points difference and the nature of everyone playing each other, we\u2019d need to have a severe meltdown if we win Sunday.\u201d He is probably right. London\u2019s run-in epitomises that everyone will be taking points off each other: they face three of their four rivals in the remaining games. But their coach says: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any pressure on us. We\u2019ve got to this stage, which is more than what some people thought, and we get to play the teams around us.\u201d For weeks, a final-day relegation showdown with Wakefield seemed inevitable, but Trinity \u2013 who also play on Sunday \u2013 have eased their own fears lately. A run of one win in 11 games dragged them into the mire, but victory against Hull KR a fortnight ago was decisive. \u201cIt\u2019s been very challenging,\u201d says the Wakefield coach, Chris Chester, whose side face Wigan. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through the mill over the last few months and hopefully we\u2019re getting through the other side of it now.\u201d As things stand, London would have to travel to Wakefield on the final day and beat them by more than 70 points to relegate Trinity. It is far more likely that if the Broncos do survive against all the odds, it will be at the expense of one of Huddersfield or Hull KR. \u201cIf you\u2019d offered this position at the start of the year, would we have taken it? Absolutely,\u201d says Ward, who has done a remarkable job in London. As he points out, that they are still bottom despite achieving so much this season probably makes them favourites to go right now. But this season has shown you can take nothing for granted when it comes to the bottom of the table.",

Girls!</p> <p>And who is disrupting the American economy in a big way? Single ladies!</p> <p>By 2030, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/29/economy/single-women-economy/index.html\">45% of working women aged 25-44 in the US will be single</a>, according to a recent research report from Morgan Stanley based on Census Bureau Data. This would be the largest share of single working women ever \u2013 up from 41% in 2018. A number of social trends are driving this, including the fact that women now receive <a href=\"https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/women-earn-57-us-bachelors-degrees-18th-straight-year\">more bachelors degrees than men</a> and people waiting longer to get married. Morgan Stanley further notes that \u201cthe fastest-growing segment among women is the \u2018never-married\u2019\u201d which it expects to grow from around 25% in 2000 to almost 33% in 2030.</p> <p>So what does this mean? Well, according to the Morgan Stanley report, which is titled \u201cRise of the SHEconomy\u201d, it means you might want to think about buying shares in Lululemon and make-up companies. The investment firm notes that single people outspend their married counterparts in the personal care and beauty category, \u201cwith an outsized gap among single women\u201d. The report also observes that Starbucks is very popular with women and the increase in single women \u201cwill drive growth in the luxury and electric vehicle segments.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan Stanley may well be right, but I\u2019ve got to admit I found their report incredibly depressing. Women have spent hundreds of years scrambling for equality \u2013 all so that investment bankers can tell people to invest in yoga pants and lipstick, apparently.</p> <p>I also find it a little bizarre that, in 2019, we are still seeing reports with names like \u201cRise of the SHEconomy\u201d which point out that investing in female-focussed brands is probably a good idea. No SHEeet Sherlock! Women have been driving the economy for a very long time; this isn\u2019t new news. \u201cArguably, women are now the most powerful engine of global growth,\u201d the Economist <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2006/04/12/a-guide-to-womenomics\">wrote back in 2006.</a> And a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2009/09/the-female-economy\">Harvard Business Review article from 2009</a> notes that \u201cin aggregate, women represent a growth market bigger than China and India combined \u2013 more than twice as big, in fact.\u201d</p> <p>It has long been clear that women are an economic force to be reckoned with. Nevertheless, the corporate world has been incredibly slow to take female consumers seriously. Single women, in particular, have been overlooked by marketers. A study last year, for example, found that 48% of single women <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/its-time-to-ditch-the-isolating-single-women-stereotypes-and-expand-marketing-efforts-to-include-them/\">surveyed \u201cthink they are virtually nonexistent in advertising.\u201d</a> When they are in ads they\u2019re normally portrayed as lonely or hypersexualized. And it\u2019s not just adverts, single women are still shamed and stigmatized by society.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Rise of the SHEconomy Who run the world? Girls! And who is disrupting the American economy in a big way? Single ladies! By 2030, 45% of working women aged 25-44 in the US will be single, according to a recent research report from Morgan Stanley based on Census Bureau Data. This would be the largest share of single working women ever \u2013 up from 41% in 2018. A number of social trends are driving this, including the fact that women now receive more bachelors degrees than men and people waiting longer to get married. Morgan Stanley further notes that \u201cthe fastest-growing segment among women is the \u2018never-married\u2019\u201d which it expects to grow from around 25% in 2000 to almost 33% in 2030. So what does this mean? Well, according to the Morgan Stanley report, which is titled \u201cRise of the SHEconomy\u201d, it means you might want to think about buying shares in Lululemon and make-up companies. The investment firm notes that single people outspend their married counterparts in the personal care and beauty category, \u201cwith an outsized gap among single women\u201d. The report also observes that Starbucks is very popular with women and the increase in single women \u201cwill drive growth in the luxury and electric vehicle segments.\u201d Morgan Stanley may well be right, but I\u2019ve got to admit I found their report incredibly depressing. Women have spent hundreds of years scrambling for equality \u2013 all so that investment bankers can tell people to invest in yoga pants and lipstick, apparently. I also find it a little bizarre that, in 2019, we are still seeing reports with names like \u201cRise of the SHEconomy\u201d which point out that investing in female-focussed brands is probably a good idea. No SHEeet Sherlock! Women have been driving the economy for a very long time; this isn\u2019t new news. \u201cArguably, women are now the most powerful engine of global growth,\u201d the Economist wrote back in 2006. And a Harvard Business Review article from 2009 notes that \u201cin aggregate, women represent a growth market bigger than China and India combined \u2013 more than twice as big, in fact.\u201d It has long been clear that women are an economic force to be reckoned with. Nevertheless, the corporate world has been incredibly slow to take female consumers seriously. Single women, in particular, have been overlooked by marketers. A study last year, for example, found that 48% of single women surveyed \u201cthink they are virtually nonexistent in advertising.\u201d When they are in ads they\u2019re normally portrayed as lonely or hypersexualized. And it\u2019s not just adverts, single women are still shamed and stigmatized by society. Being single can also be expensive; unmarried people often pay a lot more tax than their married counterparts. Unmarried women have been ignored, patronized, and pitied for a very long time. But as Morgan Stanley\u2019s report shows, all the single ladies are taking over now. Forget putting a ring on it, it\u2019s time to show single women some much overdue respect.

This team will be extremely hard to stop in the grand final in two weeks and whoever plays them will need to find a way to shut down Langman and Pretorius if they want to have a chance of taking it out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sc_lightning/status/1167692347032907779\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FULL TIME: LIGHTNING TAKE THE WIN!

Probably my favourite thing about this whole game is that the Knights have a player called Bradman Best. Yes, he certainly was young man and you can bet he\u2019d tell you all about it if you gave him the chance. The Knights had seven different try-scorers for their seven tries, a true team effort there.

With the AFL taking an incredibly baffling bye weekend the week before finals start, it\u2019s down to the Super Netball and NRL to fill the void. In the NRL, we have three games going on - the clash of the \u2018why is this season still going, is it Mad Monday yet\u2019 Titans and Knights will begin soon, while later on Manly will take on the Storm in a bid to get themselves into the top four before the finals begin and later still the Panthers will look to take down the second placed Roosters in a final desperate bid for the top eight.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the Super Netball, it\u2019s finals time and today we have the major semi in the delightfully named Sippy Downs between the Sunshine Coast Lightning and the NSW Swifts. On recent form, this game is the Lightning\u2019s to lose, but write off the Swifts at your peril - this team have pulled themselves out of the depths of despair more times than you can poke a stick at this season. So let\u2019s get to it!</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave Sportwatch for this Saturday. A somewhat subdued affair with the absence of AFL looming like the ghost of Christmases past over proceedings. A big result in the Super Netball though with the Lightning downing the Swifts by ten after a big third-quarter blowout - winning through to their third consecutive grand final, as the season of Noeline Taurua just continues. In the NRL there were wins for the Knights, Storm and Roosters as the Panthers\u2019 outside hopes of finals footy finally faded and Manly suffered a big hit to their top four hopes with Tom Trbojevic also limping out with a possible season-ending pectoral injury. There\u2019s still plenty to come overnight from the US Open where Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev are in action, as well as Aussie youngster Alexei Popyrin, while in the women\u2019s draw Kiki Bertens and Caroline Wozniacki are the pick of the action in their respective clashes. Thanks for your company tonight - we\u2019ll be back tomorrow with much more to digest, including the washup from Jeff Horn\u2019s boxing bout and the Boomers taking court at the Basketball World Cup. Seven on the trot, and even without Cooper Cronk and their skipper Boyd Cordner the Chooks have shown their experience, and their defensive resilience, to keep out a hard-working and hard-striving Panthers outfit that ultimately just lacked a ruthlessness in finishing. Strong on their own line just before the major break, Sydney ground down their opponents, while youngsters like Verrills stood tall in the absence of more senior players like Jake Friend. They sew up second on the table, the Roosters, who now face a huge final round clash with the Rabbitohs - who will be chasing a top four finish and a chance to claim a big scalp enroute. But it\u2019s goodnight to the Panthers. That\u2019s their season over - they huffed and puffed, but it just wasn\u2019t to be. Try! Sydney Roosters 22-6 Penrith Panthers (Tupou) 75 min: They\u2019re out on their feet and they know their night, and their season, is over, the Panthers. Sam Verrills has been running the show from halfback, and once again the quick ball gets the Roosters moving. Mitchell and the winger Tupou combining brilliantly. Not much real estate to operate in but the hands were sublime and the legs pumped like pistons. Cricket: After the pure unadulterated adrenaline of that miraculous third Test run chase, it\u2019s probably good that there\u2019s a bit of break between the third and fourth Tests. The Australians are however in action today in a three-day tour match against Derbyshire. Mitch Starc and Jimmy Neser did well with the ball before Mitch Marsh and Usman Khawaja got amongst the runs with 70-odd each. Meanwhile, here\u2019s Vic Marks\u2019 write-up ahead of the fourth Test where surely it\u2019s time for somebody else (apart from Archer) to stand up for England: 70 min: One man with top-end talent still is James Maloney, and the battle-worn half has kicked his side a 40-20! Brilliant stuff, and Penrith get another look at the Roosters line. They\u2019re less than 10m out as Martin is brought down. Ach. They go wide - and Stephen Crichton has bombed it! Ball to ground - and that has to be the season. 67 min: Ooph. A chance there for the Panthers - but the kick chase wasn\u2019t there! A gaping tryline, Tedesco and Keary deceived by the bounce of the ball, but they eventually scramble to recover. Those are the margins at this level. Both sides are completing at 90%+. It\u2019s been high quality footy. But they just don\u2019t have the top-end talent that the Roosters possess, especially in the backline. 60 min: They still pinned back in their half, the Panthers - not that they\u2019ve given up. They\u2019re fighting hard, but the Roosters have been clinically efficient tonight. A burst from Liam Martin gets Penrith gaining good metres, and Maloney goes to the air again - but it\u2019s meat and drink for Morris. As they have all year they just haven\u2019t managed to find the final option and puts points on. Roosters too calm. 53 min: They opted against a kick at goal in the first half, but they\u2019ve decided to play sensible footy now. Cleary (jnr, not the coach running onto the field) puts a late hit on, and Latrell asks for his tee. Two extra added as they move to 18-6, the Roosters. Increasingly hard to see how Penrith come back from here. But, where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way. Football: And if you thought the NPL final was the high point for the day, it transpires that there\u2019s a little more football action for those counting down their prison-wall calendar until the A-League kicks off again. Over in the English Premier League it\u2019s the Slayers of Brighton vs the Slayees of Crystal Palace: Try! Sydney Roosters 16-6 Penrith Panthers (Mitchell) 49 min: That was as inevitable as the Titanic once it had struck the iceberg. Tedesco and Mitchell both loomed on the short side and there was absolutely no way the Panthers were keeping them out from there. He\u2019s missed the kick, but it\u2019s still Latrell 8-6 Panthers. They need something very special from here, Penrith, or it\u2019s goodnight, nurse and farewell to the NRL 2019 season. 48 min: They\u2019re back on the attack, the Roosters. Scrum 15m out after a ball down as Naden knocked a pass to ground. Big opportunity for a set piece - they need to hang on here, the Panthers. Their season is hanging by a claw. 45 min: Oh my! They\u2019ve absolutely butchered that - and, oh dear. It was Nat Butcher. That\u2019s a dolly. Sportswriters aren\u2019t notoriously the sharpest in the shed, but when they lob them over the plate like that. He\u2019d burst through, the interchange player for the Roosters - it looked a try for all money, but credit the recovering defence I guess as it ends with ball to ground. A warning shot from Sydney. NRL - second half! But back to our feature match. We\u2019ve kicked off, and as per the first half the Roosters have conceded an early penalty, this time from Tupou for a marginally high tackle. What can the Panthers muster? Football - NSW NPL Final: Apia Leichhardt 2-1 Sydney United And they\u2019ve done it! 16 years since they were last NSW champions, the 2019 table runners up have won the finals\u2019 series! Sean Symons\u2019 extra-time goal was enough. Great effort from one of the country\u2019s proud teams, Sydney United, but it\u2019s not theirs today. The vino will be flowing along Marion and Norton st, viva viva! Half-time: Sydney 12-6 Penrith A cracking finish to the half; after all that Penrith pressure it was the Chooks trying the Hail Mary with a on-the-whistle field goal! It didn\u2019t come off, and we go in with the margin just one converted try. A pulsating finish to this first forty. 37 min: Some good work from Penrith as they earn a repeat six. They\u2019ve banged it 55m on the restart though, the Roosters. Woof. Some great sustained pressure from the Panthers - can they make it count on the scoreboard though? Great work to finish the half - they\u2019re throwing everything at it. Nathan Cleary looks for the line - has he crossed? He has! But they\u2019re going upstairs. Campbell-Gillard pinged for obstruction in the defensive line and it\u2019s no try! Unlucky for the Panthers - they\u2019ve huffed and puffed. Repeat six after repeat six - but they\u2019ve not been able to make it count where it matters. Goal! NPL NSW Final - Apia Leichhardt 2-1 Sydney United! And we have a goal in extra-time! The \u2018keeper came, but didn\u2019t claim, and it\u2019s a clever improvised lop from Sean Symons - is this the winner?! Wollongong Wolves were the front runners all season, but it could be the side that finished second on the table who claim the silverware! 25 min: They\u2019re in the mood now, the Roosters. They started slowly, but the early conceded try clearly stung the pride. Latrell Mitchell with a bustling, bruising run, but they hang on, Penrith. They\u2019re finding it tough bringing it out from their own line. They\u2019re only just shading possession, Sydney, but they\u2019ve arguably done a bit more with it so far. Maloney with a clever kick to release the pressure. Still, if they can grab something before half-time they go in level, the Panthers. Try! Sydney 12-6 Penrith (Tedesco) 18 min: Deary me. Is their season on the line, Penrith? Having started in such promising fashion they\u2019ve been carved up with aplomb here. And only seconds after the restart from the first try! Almost coast to coast, as they back up well from the burst from Crichton. Good hands from Keary - unselfish at the end, and who else? It\u2019s Tedesco. Another easy one for Latrell. They\u2019re ahead by six, just like that. Try! Sydney 6-6 Penrith (Verrills) 15 min: They\u2019ve leveled the ledger, the Roosters! Again, some suspect line defence, but credit the attacking movement. Very little looking on for the hooker, Verrills, but he\u2019s channeled Damien Cook with a super burst through a pack of Panthers defenders. Tamou there surely could have done more - he\u2019s caught the markers napping! Mitchell adds the extras. Too easy, Roosters. Football: Now for our A-League-starved football fans, there has of course been some second-tier state competitions in action tonight. Have you been at a ground tonight and can share us any of the details from the various NPL clashes? Drop us an email or tweet. In Victoria the Bentleigh Greens have rolled Green Gully 1-0 (in the \u201cGreen Derby\u201d) to win through to a semi-final. Meanwhile, in NSW it\u2019s the NPL final - where Apia Leichhardt and Sydney United have gone to extra-time, with the scores locked at 1-1! 6,426 fans in attendance there, reportedly - great to see such support down the pyramid. We\u2019ll try and keep across that clash for you if we can. 11 min: Six again! The fullback Edwards bats it dead after Tedesco drops the well-weighted grubber into the in-goal. A good response from the Roosters, as they maintain some pressure on the visitors. They play inside the 10m with five gone - they go to the air for Tupou who\u2019s a notorious leaper. Has he knocked this forward, or do we have a try?! We go upstairs. No try! Looked close, but the Bunker suggests a slight touch from the big winger. They remain scoreless, the Roosters. 8 min: They look for a 40-20, the Panthers, but Tedesco is alive to the threat. Great intensity from Penrith so far, but they\u2019ve just gone a step too far - Maloney pinged for a second tackle on the fullback. Can the Roosters capitalise on that overexuberance? Try! Sydney 0-6 Penrith (Kikau) 3 min: Here\u2019s a bright start! We mentioned pre-game how important tonight is to the Panthers\u2019 season, and they\u2019ve started in impressive fashion. The big second-rower Kikau one-on-one with Manu and he\u2019s just brushed him off and powers over! Cleary adds the extras, and the tails are up. Will this sting the hosts into an immediate reaction? So, without further ado - to our feature match on Saturday Sportwatch. It\u2019s the home side kicking off, but it\u2019s an early infringement. The veteran Kiwi Jared Waerea-Hargreaves is pinged for a dangerous tackle. What an absolute battle-ax he is - he\u2019s been doing it week-in, week out for seemingly forever. But just outside the bounds of the laws on that occasion. For a third time in four seasons the Melbourne Storm have finished top of the pops. The Roosters can\u2019t catch them, and it\u2019s now a remarkable seven years since a team other than Melbourne or Sydney has finished on top of the ladder. Congratulations, Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy and staff. They notched 18 in the first half, and 18 in the second - six tries to one in an emphatic display of might from the table-leaders. You\u2019d have to call that a flex - they\u2019ve gone out there and blown away the Eagles - who you\u2019ll note have been in pretty handy form themselves recently. Olam with three tries, Addo-Carr, Asofa-Solomona and the hyphen-less Papenhuyzen with the others. Another expert performance from the Storm, who like a nice meringue are rising just when it matters. Big concerns for the Eagles though. Is that Tom Trbojevic gone for the season? And does this kiss goodbye their top four hopes? Big headaches for Dessie going into the final round of the season. Try! Manly 6-36 Melbourne (Olam) 78 min: Ooph. Only one team out there still running it seems, as the Storm - with Cameron Munster limping off leaving them with just ELEVEN players (with Chambers still in the bin) - they\u2019ve still gone over and scored! Try! Manly 6-30 Melbourne (Papenhuyzen) A lot of teams go ahead when they\u2019ve a man advantage, but it\u2019s a sign of the Sea Eagle\u2019s night that they\u2019ve gone further behind! It\u2019s the fullback Papenhuyzen - nothing too flash there, just pins the ears, slides across the defence and picks the gap! Lovely work, and good hands from Hughes in the lead up. Boxing: Now there is the little matter of the \u201cBattle of Bendigo\u201d to come later tonight, but that may unfortunately fall just outside our watch. Jeff Horn is back in the ring, and he\u2019ll be taking on Michael Zerafa. Plenty of interesting chat in the lead up to this bout, including Jeff Horn bemoaning \u201conline bullying\u201d trying to discredit his remarkable win over Manny Pacquiao. (Which if anything proves the gutless nature of anonymous trolls, who you 100% know would never say it to Jeff Horn\u2019s face). Three people who won\u2019t be in the ring are the \u201ccard girls\u201d - who have been replaced by \u201cfight progress managers\u201d after local complaints from the Bendigo council: 69 min: Bit of stink! You can tell your side\u2019s butchered a series of good chances when this happens. Almost a Bronx cheer from the home side, who at least see their side finally showing some life. Will Chambers with a high shot on Jack Gosiewski who stays down. Dylan Walker flies in and that starts the fracas. Chambers in the bin! He leaves to a chorus of boos - they don\u2019t love him in Brookvale. 65 min: Good work from Garrick at the back as he defuses a tricky bomb. Now to look to bring out. Walker with good metres before DCE fires a swirling effort; and Addo Carr makes a meal of it! Papenhuyzen cleans up, but they\u2019ve been penalised at the play the ball, Melbourne. Big six for Manly! They\u2019re 10m out and knocking at the door. The purple wall arranges though - they\u2019ve been immense in defence, the Storm. And would you believe - it\u2019s DCE who puts to ground! Were the eyes on the defence? Either way, it\u2019s ball down and once again, the opportunity is lost. A bit of pump from the NRL social media padowan there. Try of the year? Almost certainly not. Impressive hands from Addo-Carr, but with a slice of fortune that big you\u2019d wonder if it will even finish as try of the round, maybe even the match. Still no updates on that Tom Trbojevic\u2019s injury - if it\u2019s a ruptured pectoral than that\u2019s the season, and that\u2019s a huge loss for the Eagles. Meanwhile, Morgan Boyle is also chalked for the night, with a reported shoulder injury - it\u2019s bad to worse for the home side. Back on the field - it\u2019s a penalty to Melbourne, and Cam Smith duly slots the two. Manly 6-24 Melbourne. Try! Manly 6-22 Melbourne (Olam) 55 min: Bombed! It looked a good line from Curtis Sironen, but he\u2019s grassed it - and a great opportunity to blow this game open is missed. They double down with a sloppy penalty, and the Storm are comfortably out of their own half. What a let off! Meanwhile, four tackles later, it\u2019s terrific work from the flyer Addo-Carr to keep a ball in, he flicks back in touch, off the knee was it, of Brad Parker? And Olam is Johnny-on-the-spot, to score an absolute gift! They really do punish you, the Storm - remarkable counter punch! Smith misses from the touchline. A very slim silver lining for Eagles fans, I guess. 51 min: Penalty to Manly! The crowd likes that. Kaufusi penalised for attempting to slow the play. DCE goes to the touchline and they\u2019ve got 27m to get there - six to come. What can they make of this?! If they go in here, we are officially GAME. ON. 46 min: Terrific return from Papenhuyzen - sheesh, if Vunivalu doesn\u2019t get you the young fullback will. It\u2019s a clever kick from Jahrome Hughes and they\u2019ve earned themselves a 10m scrum restart! Surely, they\u2019re in here shortly, the Storm? No! With the line begging it\u2019s a knock on from Asofa-Solomona, and they\u2019re off the hook once again, the Sea Eagles! Second half - Manly 6-18 Melbourne: We\u2019re back from Brookvale where the hopeful will be hoping the rain doesn\u2019t turn into, *licks lips*, a Storm. They\u2019re right back on the defence the hosts, as Vunivalu sets off on a terrific kick return, and they\u2019ve ended up just shy of the Sea Eagles line, with the hosts desperately hanging on. No sign of a let up yet from Bellamy\u2019s men! Hola chicas! I hope this finds you well, hearty, hale and happy to boot. A quiet night on Saturday Sportwatch but a good chance to cast a close eye over the NRL as we approach the business end of the season. We\u2019ve still got top four spots on the line as Manly look to \u201cpull a Raiders\u201d and hand Storm a second half surprise - forty big minutes ahead there. And later, it might be an outsider\u2019s chance, but it\u2019s the only chance they\u2019ve got. The Panthers will be looking to keep their slim final\u2019s hopes alive against the high-flying Roosters. The second placed side will however be without Boyd Cordner and Cooper Cronk, who are rested. Will it be enough? Let\u2019s find out. Well that\u2019s it from me folks, I\u2019m going to hand you over to the delightful Richard Parkin for the remainder of this quiet night in sport. He\u2019ll guide you through the rest of this game, as well as the Roosters v Panthers battle that\u2019s sure to attract tens of people at the SCG on this rainy night. Go well and don\u2019t forget to watch the Super Netball minor semi-final tomorrow between the Melbourne Vixens and Collingwood Magpies - it\u2019s sure to be an absolute cracker of a game. NRL: Manly 6-18 Melbourne at half-time Things aren\u2019t looking good for Manly\u2019s top four hopes, after a lacklustre start against the Storm. To add injury to insult, fullback Tom Trbojevic left the field in what appears to be a pectoral injury. The Storm meanwhile, seem to be relishing the wet conditions (it\u2019s all in the name I guess) and are all hakuna matata. Jesse Bromwich has been sensational for the visitors, making 110m in the first half, along with 13 tackles. Football: Pretty sure this is my favourite headline from this week. And I mean, what a speech. I\u2019m crossing my fingers we get one like this at the Brownlows or the Dally Ms this year - it\u2019d make all the sitting through the counting of votes worth it. \u201cAs flies to wanton boys are we to the gods, they kill us for their sport,\u201d Cantona said, quoting King Lear. \u201cSoon the science will not only be able to slow down the ageing of the cells, soon the science will fix the cells to the state and so we will become eternal. Only accidents, crimes, wars, will still kill us but unfortunately, crimes, wars, will multiply. I love football. Thank you.\u201d Super Netball: If you want to re-live that semi-final, the match report is up now. Swifts fans, you\u2019re excused - go and prepare for next weekend. It\u2019s been a rough day for you. Basketball: Seeing the Boomers beat the USA for the first time ever was pretty exciting, but the Australians aren\u2019t resting on their laurels ahead of the Fiba World Cup. They\u2019re determined to come home with a medal and emulate the winning ways of their Opals counterparts. Rugby: There is a lot of interest around mental health in sport at the moment, but Guardian writer Robert Kitson fears too many sports are just paying lip service to mental health awareness, rather than making meaningful change to take care of their players. While rugby is the focus of this story, the same could be said for almost any professional sport. Interesting question from HarryOfOz in the comments: I think my money would be on the Titans, they might be able to just beat the Suns into submission? Or maybe we could just look at merging the teams and throwing a random collection of them out each week in both codes and see how they go? I don\u2019t think things could get any worse for either team so it\u2019s worth a shot. AFL: Did you see this great article from Cheryl Critchley during the week? It gave such a good feeling of what it was like to be at Vic Park. Being a Sydneysider, I never made it out there, but it reminded me a lot of the feeling you get at Kogarah and Leichhardt Ovals. They\u2019re not the most modern or comfortable, but sometimes you just can\u2019t beat that atmosphere at suburban grounds. Cricket: And speaking of the Ashes, this was a lovely piece from Max Rushden on how Jack Leach gives the illusion that we could all go out there and have a crack at Test cricket. Like Daniel Vettori before him, everyone loves a nerdy looking guy in glasses playing cricket at the highest level. Cricket: A blow for Jimmy Anderson, ruled out of the remainder of the Ashes series. England have proved they can manage without him, but they would have breathed easier if he was available, especially with Australia regaining Steve Smith for the fourth Test. It wouldn\u2019t have been the game that broadcasters were hoping for, the Lightning able to cruise to a comfortable lead after two solid opening quarters, following by a rampaging third quarter and a nice easy fourth. The moving circle was their strength for most of the match, once Laura Scherian was able to hit the circle edge consistently and get her feeds around the Swifts\u2019 defenders. However they didn\u2019t lose too much momentum when Proscovia entered the game and either she or Koenen will be damaging in the grand final, whoever Taurua decides to use. This means the grand final will be held in Brisbane in two weeks - not exactly home for the Lightning, but after winning in hostile Perth in 2018 they will be more than capable of winning in their home state. The Swifts meanwhile, head home to Sydney to take on the winner of tomorrow\u2019s minor semi-final between the Melbourne Vixens and Collingwood Magpies. They will hope for a 10k+ crowd at Qudos to be their \u2018eighth player\u2019 against whichever Victorian team they play. Player of the match unsurprisingly is Laura Langman, who absolutely loves these big occasions. This team will be extremely hard to stop in the grand final in two weeks and whoever plays them will need to find a way to shut down Langman and Pretorius if they want to have a chance of taking it out. Super Netball: 11 mins Lightning 53-43 Swifts The Swifts aren\u2019t giving up without a fight, but it\u2019s not quite enough of a fight with a margin so big. They don\u2019t call the third quarter \u201cthe championship quarter\u201d for nothing. The 18-10 scoreline that quarter really set the Lightning up well to close the game out without too much scoreboard pressure on them. The Swifts have tried every player in their match day squad in every position they can think of to stop this Sunshine Coast team, but nothing is working. Things didn\u2019t improve for the poor old Titans in the second half and I think they\u2019ll be putting a request in to please never play a team the week after they\u2019ve sacked their coach again. Luckily for them they play the Dragons next week, so may still finish off the season on a happy note before chalking up 2019 to experience. Probably my favourite thing about this whole game is that the Knights have a player called Bradman Best. Yes, he certainly was young man and you can bet he\u2019d tell you all about it if you gave him the chance. The Knights had seven different try-scorers for their seven tries, a true team effort there. Herman Ese\u2019ese was phenomenal with the ball in hand, making 123m for the Novacastrians. Super Netball: 6 mins Lightning 47-39 Swifts The Swifts have lifted since the break, slightly ahead so far this quarter, but that won\u2019t help them bridge the huge margin. Peace Proscovia enters the match, as predicted, then Lightning immediately call a time-out which is weird. Seems like a mis-communication between the coaches and Cara Koenen. The Lightning will now need to adjust to a holding circle, a good test for them when the moving circle has been so strong for them so far. Super Netball: Lightning 45-34 Swifts at three-quarter time It will be interesting to see if the Lightning use this last quarter to run some of their bench - to make sure they get some finals experience in them in case they\u2019re needed in the grand final. I\u2019d expect to see Peace Proscovia in goal shooter and Jacqui Russell in wing defence for at least some of the last quarter. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll risk bringing Annika Lee-Jones on, knowing how hard this Swifts team can come back if they get fired up. They won\u2019t want to leave anything to chance and Lee-Jones is unlikely to play the grand final unless something major happens. Super Netball: 11 mins Lightning 42-30 Swifts This is just a netball master class from the Lightning now. They look unstoppable and the Swifts\u2019 performance has been lacklustre. The lack of finals experience, along with a lot of attrition this season, seems to be really getting to them. Langman and Pretorius, on the other hand, are the epitome of big game players and are hitting this thing out of the park. Super Netball: 4 mins Lightning 33-26 Swifts Helen Housby is back on court, but Karla Pretorius isn\u2019t giving her a warm welcome, she is absolutely riding her and taking full advantage of that lack of match fitness we spoke about earlier. Little mistakes are starting to creep into the Swifts\u2019 game. This is their first finals match of Super Netball after failing to qualify for finals for the past two years. The Lightning on the other hand, are the reigning premiers and thrive on these kind of pressure situations. The difference is looking quite marked at the moment, so it will be interesting to see how the Swifts rise to the occasion. They take a time-out after a 6-1 start to the half from the Lightning and young Tayla Fraser comes on to replace Paige Hadley in centre. Cricket: Not a completely glorious return for Steve Smith in the tour match against Derbyshire, making just 23 runs. However he\u2019ll be pleased he\u2019s made a return and will no doubt learn from it to come back stronger in the next Ashes Test. Football: Exciting news for the A-League today as they announced Kate Jacewicz is set to become their first female referee in the upcoming season. From AAP: The A-League is set to join the NRL and AFL with the first female referee appointed to the league\u2019s match official panel. Kate Jacewicz, an eight-time W-League referee of the year, is one of two new names added to the league\u2019s referees panel for the 2019-20 season along with Ben Abraham. Her appointment follows in the footsteps of the AFL\u2019s first female field umpire Eleni Glouftsis and NRL referee Belinda Sharpe, who became the first woman referee in a professional rugby league match earlier this year. Jacewicz\u2019s most recent assignment was refereeing two matches at this year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup in France, and FFA chairman Chris Nikou said the 34-year-old more than had the credentials to referee in the A-League. \u201cKate is without doubt one of the leading referees in the world at any level,\u201d Nikou said. Jacewicz\u2019s appointment comes after Stephanie Frappart refereed the European Super Cup clash between Liverpool and Chelsea a fortnight ago. Super Netball: Lightning 27-25 Swifts at half-time The Lightning started to stamp their dominance on the game in the second quarter, with some big defensive plays from the usual suspects in Karla Pretorius and Phumza Maweni and even WD Maddy McAuliffe getting into the action with a beautiful intercept. The Swifts looked to create some more rhythm in attack by bringing on Sophie Garbin in GA for Helen Housby, who has been out for a number of weeks with a thigh strain. This may prove to be a smart move later in the match - Housby\u2019s match fitness will be slightly down after her break and getting fresh legs on now will allow her to play a key role later in the game without worrying about the fatigue factor. Some nervous shooting on both sides is giving the defenders plenty of chances to get hands to ball, we\u2019ll keep an eye on how that plays out and if the shooters have their eye in better in the second half. Super Netball: 7 mins Lightning 19-20 Swifts The Swifts came out flying after the break and Scherian continued her struggles with Rore. However the Lighning are not a team that lies down and they kept on fighting, getting Scherian to the circle edge more consistently so she doesn\u2019t have to battle those Rore arms. Lightning have called a time out while they\u2019re the team with momentum, which is an interesting move. Noeline Taurua must have something she wants them to execute off the next centre pass. NRL: Newcastle 24-4 Gold Coast at half-time The Knights follow the age old tradition of having a cracker of a game immediately after the coach is sacked. Four tries from four different try-scorers in the first half has fueled their amazing game, which unfortunately almost no one is there to watch. Sure, it\u2019s raining and they were worse than terrible last weekend, but what else is there to do in Newcastle? Super Netball: Lightning 13-14 Swifts at quarter-time With no bonus points in play for finals, the Lightning won\u2019t be too worried about this small quarter-time margin. However they didn\u2019t look confident playing the ball around to eat up the clock and close off the quarter with even scores. Young goal shooter Cara Koenen took a shot with over 20 seconds left on the clock and a Swifts centre pass to follow, giving the visitors enough time to score and take a first quarter lead. We\u2019ll keep an eye out for any changes for the second quarter, but my guess is both teams will remain as is for now. Super Netball: 11 mins Lightning 8-11 Swifts It\u2019s a scrappy game, but the Swifts have a slight upper hand at the moment. Lightning\u2019s defence is good, but they are struggling to break through in attack. However they do have Ugandan star Peace Proscovia on the bench and she might be the spark they need if brought on. And if you missed Laura Langman\u2019s amazing first intercept, here it is. Super Netball: 6 mins Lightning 5-6 Swifts The game started with Langman doing Langman things - snaffling an intercept off the first centre pass to kick the game off for the home team. However the Swifts weren\u2019t fazed and went about their business until their own Kiwi star, Katrina Rore, monstered her 20cm shorter oponnent in Laura Scherian to force a turnover. The game has been goal for goal since then. Cricket: I think a lot of people were in the same boat as Declan Kay on this one - I know I was. In our defence, it didn\u2019t seem like it was going to be an exciting game for quite a while there! Declan gives a great account of that terrible FOMO that accompanies life as an Australian sporting fan. Basketball: Some of our Guardian writers have put together their predictions for the upcoming Fiba World Cup. Check them out here and let me know what you make of them! Super Netball: The coverage has just started, so get yourself to a TV and get settled in. While you\u2019re there, let me know what you think of the starting lines for both teams. And if you felt like it, you could also read my article from yesterday looking at the bonus point system and how it worked across its first two seasons in play. Football: An exciting announcement today, the Matildas are set to play two friendlies against Chile in November - one at the new Bankwest Stadium in Parramatta and the other at Adelaide\u2019s Coopers Stadium. A great opportunity for the team to build on their momentum from the World Cup and prepare for their upcoming Olympic qualifiers. Tennis: Plenty happening in the US Open at the moment, including victories for two Australians overnight in Ash Barty and Alex de Minaur. Both are playing brilliant tennis at the moment and it\u2019s been exciting to see them shine. Barty is on a collision course with Serena Williams, while de Minaur is heading for a Roger Federer match up, so some big games coming for the young Australians. Welcome to a slightly less busy day of sport! With the AFL taking an incredibly baffling bye weekend the week before finals start, it\u2019s down to the Super Netball and NRL to fill the void. In the NRL, we have three games going on - the clash of the \u2018why is this season still going, is it Mad Monday yet\u2019 Titans and Knights will begin soon, while later on Manly will take on the Storm in a bid to get themselves into the top four before the finals begin and later still the Panthers will look to take down the second placed Roosters in a final desperate bid for the top eight. Meanwhile in the Super Netball, it\u2019s finals time and today we have the major semi in the delightfully named Sippy Downs between the Sunshine Coast Lightning and the NSW Swifts. On recent form, this game is the Lightning\u2019s to lose, but write off the Swifts at your peril - this team have pulled themselves out of the depths of despair more times than you can poke a stick at this season. So let\u2019s get to it!",

And for progressives, that\u2019s a dream come true.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Elizabeth Warren Is Completely Serious\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Sanders, a senator from Vermont who at 77 is the oldest candidate in the field, no longer has the element of surprise he enjoyed against Hillary Clinton in 2016. He continues to promise free tuition at public universities, a $15-an-hour minimum wage and universal healthcare. He still has a peerless network of small-dollar donors and continues to generate enthusiasm at rallies.</p> <p>Warren, a 70-year-old senator from Massachusetts and longtime critic of Wall Street, has enjoyed a slow but inexorable surge. She has promised to \u201cfight\u201d \u2013 one of her favourite words \u2013 a rigged system and has released detailed policy proposals on everything from breaking up tech companies to implementing a \u201cwealth tax\u201d on the rich.</p> <p>Her populist economic message has struck a chord, drawing big crowds \u2013 15,000 in Seattle; 12,000 in St Paul, Minnesota \u2013 and positive media buzz. \u201cThe Very Real Possibility of President Elizabeth Warren\u201d was Rolling Stone\u2019s headline; \u201cSlowly and Persistently, Elizabeth Warren Is On the Rise\u201d declared New York magazine; \u201cElizabeth Warren Is Completely Serious\u201d trumpeted a profile in the New York Times.</p> <p>Charles Chamberlain, chair of the progressive group Democracy for America, said: \u201cShe\u2019s the big winner of the last eight months. We\u2019ve seen her steadily climb among our members. It\u2019s a well run, well executed campaign, clearly engaging with voters. But Bernie Sanders has also been campaigning hard \u2013 it\u2019s been \u2018steady as she goes\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWarren and Bernie have been dominating the debate; I feel like the Biden campaign is very much on the defensive when it comes to policy. The rallies for Biden are eerily reminiscent of the lacklustre campaign of Hillary Clinton. Warren and Bernie are going to event after event and just getting bigger.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc5c91f7eef227aa2160f739e551d63423cd31b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5c91f7eef227aa2160f739e551d63423cd31b0/0_354_5355_3213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden listens to a question from a representative of Moms Demand Action, a pro-gun control group, in South Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden listens to a question from a representative of Moms Demand Action, a pro-gun control group, in South Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Rayford/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chamberlain shares the view that Biden will fade.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is going to come down to a Democratic primary with Warren and Bernie at the top,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither should drop out. They need to fight this to the end, even if that means going to a convention where deals have to be made.\u201d</p> <p>Who would win such a fight remains a matter of conjecture. Sanders won his first national union endorsement this week from the 35,000-member United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America. But most unions remain on the fence.</p> <p>Liberal groups are also split. In June Warren led a MoveOn survey with the support of 38% of members, followed by Sanders with 17%. In July, Sanders topped a Democracy for America poll with 32%, followed by Warren on 26%. In both cases, Warren had gained ground.</p> <p>Indeed, she has gathered momentum nationally, overcoming controversy about her dubious claims of Native American ancestry, while Sanders has arguably hit a ceiling. There is a perception, at least, that she is gaining at his expense.</p> <p>Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chair now a political analyst for the MSNBC network, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen, in the rise of Elizabeth Warren, the Bernie Sanders voter falling off of Bernie, finding a better, younger fort to to dock their ship to, if you will. They don\u2019t think that they are losing a step with Elizabeth; in fact, they are probably gaining a few more steps because she checked a number of other boxes for them \u2013 in terms of being a woman, for example.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If both campaigns feel that they have traction, you won\u2019t have an incentive there for either one of them to drop out</p> <footer> <cite>John Zogby</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that in the numbers, how she\u2019s eclipsed him and now passed him in the polling, where in some polls she\u2019s a lot closer to Joe Biden than Bernie was in the past.\u201d</p> <p>This week Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York became the sixth Democrat to drop out of the race since July. Steele does not expect Sanders or Warren to throw in the towel any time soon.</p> <p>\u201cIf both campaigns feel that they have traction and they\u2019re polling relatively close to each other, you won\u2019t have an incentive there for either one of them to drop out. They\u2019re both raising money, they\u2019re both organising on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019re going to be fairly competitive with each other until one separates clearly from the other. That has not happened yet. If I\u2019m Elizabeth Warren, I\u2019m not going to cede that ground to Bernie Sanders, and if I\u2019m Bernie Sanders I\u2019m certainly not going to cede ground to her that I established going back to 2016.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Bearer of the torch\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Imagined as a Venn diagram, there is common ground between Warren and Sanders voters but each has their own distinct base. A survey by the Pew Research Center this month found that about seven in 10 of Warren\u2019s supporters are white, compared to about half of Sanders\u2019 backers. Warren\u2019s supporters are substantially more likely to have a college degree compared with supporters of Biden and Sanders.</p> <p>John Zogby, a pollster and author, said: \u201cBecause of progressive ideology there is some sort of overlap, but they are different. Warren picks up support among women that ordinarily Sanders would not get, including former Clinton supporters who regard her as the bearer of the torch to get a woman elected.</p> <p>\u201cTo assume that if one drops out, he or she would back the other is too facile. If Warren dropped out, she would probably consider that she had some leverage in the mainstream of the party and a chance to run again in the future, so would most likely endorse a mainstream figure like Biden.\u201d</p> <p>The senators have differences in style and substance. Warren embraces the term \u201ccapitalist\u201d and is seen by some as less disruptive to corporate interests; Sanders characterises himself as a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d and offers fewer policy specifics. Warren refused to appear on Fox News; Sanders held a town hall on the network. Warren has just taken her 50,000th campaign selfie with supporters who wait in long lines; Sanders retains a curmudgeonly persona and showed little appetite for small talk at the recent Iowa state fair.</p> <p>But when the duo, who remain fast friends, appeared together in the second debate in Detroit, distinctions appeared insignificant as they joined forces to fend off centrists on their support of policies such as Medicare for All, which would extend the existing government-run health insurance programme to all Americans, largely eliminating a role for private insurance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/30/trump-fox-news-network-neil-cavuto\">Trouble in paradise: Trump attacks Fox News \u2013 and Fox News hits back</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the end, however, even if the progressive dream comes true, there is bound to be disappointment and compromise for someone. Handy, 31, the former Ready for Warren activist, said: \u201cIn terms of the entire political spectrum, I would much prefer a Warren administration to a [Kamala] Harris administration or a second term of Trump. But that said, it just won\u2019t go far enough.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this country needs now more than ever is what we had post-world war two with the building of the American middle class and FDR\u2019s incredible social reform. That is what a Sanders administration will do, and my fear is that a Warren administration will not go far enough in addressing income inequality, in addressing criminal justice reform, in addressing our climate, in addressing all of these problems.\u201d</p>",

But Bernie Sanders has also been campaigning hard \u2013 it\u2019s been \u2018steady as she goes\u2019. \u201cWarren and Bernie have been dominating the debate; I feel like the Biden campaign is very much on the defensive when it comes to policy. The rallies for Biden are eerily reminiscent of the lacklustre campaign of Hillary Clinton. Warren and Bernie are going to event after event and just getting bigger.\u201d Chamberlain shares the view that Biden will fade. \u201cI think this is going to come down to a Democratic primary with Warren and Bernie at the top,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither should drop out. They need to fight this to the end, even if that means going to a convention where deals have to be made.\u201d Who would win such a fight remains a matter of conjecture. Sanders won his first national union endorsement this week from the 35,000-member United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America. But most unions remain on the fence. Liberal groups are also split. In June Warren led a MoveOn survey with the support of 38% of members, followed by Sanders with 17%. In July, Sanders topped a Democracy for America poll with 32%, followed by Warren on 26%. In both cases, Warren had gained ground. Indeed, she has gathered momentum nationally, overcoming controversy about her dubious claims of Native American ancestry, while Sanders has arguably hit a ceiling. There is a perception, at least, that she is gaining at his expense. Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chair now a political analyst for the MSNBC network, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen, in the rise of Elizabeth Warren, the Bernie Sanders voter falling off of Bernie, finding a better, younger fort to to dock their ship to, if you will. They don\u2019t think that they are losing a step with Elizabeth; in fact, they are probably gaining a few more steps because she checked a number of other boxes for them \u2013 in terms of being a woman, for example. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that in the numbers, how she\u2019s eclipsed him and now passed him in the polling, where in some polls she\u2019s a lot closer to Joe Biden than Bernie was in the past.\u201d This week Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York became the sixth Democrat to drop out of the race since July. Steele does not expect Sanders or Warren to throw in the towel any time soon. \u201cIf both campaigns feel that they have traction and they\u2019re polling relatively close to each other, you won\u2019t have an incentive there for either one of them to drop out. They\u2019re both raising money, they\u2019re both organising on the ground. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be fairly competitive with each other until one separates clearly from the other. That has not happened yet. If I\u2019m Elizabeth Warren, I\u2019m not going to cede that ground to Bernie Sanders, and if I\u2019m Bernie Sanders I\u2019m certainly not going to cede ground to her that I established going back to 2016.\u201d \u2018Bearer of the torch\u2019 Imagined as a Venn diagram, there is common ground between Warren and Sanders voters but each has their own distinct base. A survey by the Pew Research Center this month found that about seven in 10 of Warren\u2019s supporters are white, compared to about half of Sanders\u2019 backers. Warren\u2019s supporters are substantially more likely to have a college degree compared with supporters of Biden and Sanders. John Zogby, a pollster and author, said: \u201cBecause of progressive ideology there is some sort of overlap, but they are different. Warren picks up support among women that ordinarily Sanders would not get, including former Clinton supporters who regard her as the bearer of the torch to get a woman elected. \u201cTo assume that if one drops out, he or she would back the other is too facile. If Warren dropped out, she would probably consider that she had some leverage in the mainstream of the party and a chance to run again in the future, so would most likely endorse a mainstream figure like Biden.\u201d The senators have differences in style and substance. Warren embraces the term \u201ccapitalist\u201d and is seen by some as less disruptive to corporate interests; Sanders characterises himself as a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d and offers fewer policy specifics. Warren refused to appear on Fox News; Sanders held a town hall on the network. Warren has just taken her 50,000th campaign selfie with supporters who wait in long lines; Sanders retains a curmudgeonly persona and showed little appetite for small talk at the recent Iowa state fair. But when the duo, who remain fast friends, appeared together in the second debate in Detroit, distinctions appeared insignificant as they joined forces to fend off centrists on their support of policies such as Medicare for All, which would extend the existing government-run health insurance programme to all Americans, largely eliminating a role for private insurance. In the end, however, even if the progressive dream comes true, there is bound to be disappointment and compromise for someone. Handy, 31, the former Ready for Warren activist, said: \u201cIn terms of the entire political spectrum, I would much prefer a Warren administration to a [Kamala] Harris administration or a second term of Trump. But that said, it just won\u2019t go far enough. \u201cWhat this country needs now more than ever is what we had post-world war two with the building of the American middle class and FDR\u2019s incredible social reform. That is what a Sanders administration will do, and my fear is that a Warren administration will not go far enough in addressing income inequality, in addressing criminal justice reform, in addressing our climate, in addressing all of these problems.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There are many acclaimed poems that address themselves to the question of love. There are many that address themselves to the problems of war. There are others, both ancient and modern, that seem to speak directly to our contemporary condition, and to various crises, fears and threats of annihilation. There are poems that console, inspire and delight. And there are some poems \u2013 a very few \u2013 that do all of the above. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/whauden\" title=\"\">W</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/whauden\" title=\"\">H</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/whauden\" title=\"\"> Auden</a>\u2019s \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d, written 80 years ago, is an example.</p> <p>\u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d is undoubtedly one of the great poems of the 20th century, one that marks the beginning of the second world war and which readers have returned to at times of national and personal crisis. It is also a work that Auden came to despise, and whose troubled history therefore provides us with a rare glimpse of a writer in the act of self-invention and self-reinvention, and with a unique insight into the many ways in which a poem might be interpreted, misinterpreted, used, reused, appropriated and recycled. \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d is a lesson in how masterpieces are produced and consumed and become incorporated into people\u2019s lives \u2013 how, in the words of another of Auden\u2019s poems, \u201cIn Memory of WB Yeats\u201d, the work of a poet becomes \u201cmodified in the guts of the living\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is the most famous example in history of a writer attempting to revise his work, and of readers refusing to allow it</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The poem was first published on 18 October 1939 in the American magazine the New Republic. Auden had arrived in New York earlier that year with his friend and fellow writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/christopher-isherwood\" title=\"\">Christopher Isherwood</a>. The two men had quickly established themselves on the US literary scene: schmoozing, carousing, making contact with editors, and undertaking speaking and lecturing engagements. In April 1939, Auden had met an 18-year-old, Chester Kallman, 14 years his junior, who was to become his life partner: in the new world, Auden was making a new life for himself. Back in Europe, meanwhile, the storm clouds were gathering.</p> <p>AJP Taylor, in his famous account in <em>The Origins of the Second World War</em> (1961), claimed that a second world war \u201cwas implicit since the moment when the first world war ended\u201d. It became explicit at exactly 4.30am on Friday 1 September 1939, when the German panzer divisions that had been gathering on the Polish border began their advance. The front page headline of the New York Times that day tapped out the news in telegraphese: GERMAN ARMY ATTACKS POLAND; CITIES BOMBED, PORT BLOCKADED; DANZIG IS ACCEPTED INTO REICH. On 3 September the British prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/neville-chamberlain\" title=\"\">Neville Chamberlain</a> broadcast to the nation on the BBC: the country, he announced, was at war with Germany.</p> <p>Auden\u2019s poem consists of 99 lines, written in trimeters, divided into nine 11-line stanzas with a shifting rhyme scheme, each stanza being composed of just one sentence so that \u2013 as the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/02/brush-with-greatness-joseph-brodsky-mikhail-baryshnikov-ballet-poetry-soviets\" title=\"\">Joseph Brodsky</a> pointed out \u2013 the thought unit corresponds exactly to the stanzaic unit, which corresponds also to the grammatical unit. Which is neat. Too neat.</p> <p>Because of course this is only the beginning of an understanding of how a poem works. It takes us only to the very edges of the piece, to the outskirts of its vast territory. In order properly to comprehend it we would need to know why Auden chose this rigorous, cramped, bastard form. And why did he begin the poem with an \u201cI\u201d, undoubtedly the most depressing and dreary little pronoun in the English language?</p> <blockquote> <p><em>I sit in one of the dives </em><br><em>On Fifty-second Street</em><br><em>Uncertain and afraid </em><br><em>As the clever hopes expire </em><br><em>Of a low</em><em> dishonest decade:</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Who is this \u201cI\u201d? And why are they sitting in a dive? And is it real or is it imagined, this place? And why the double adjectives? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d165be444cc3c7b59df2aa4340389f6befba9c6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d165be444cc3c7b59df2aa4340389f6befba9c6d/0_0_2606_3746/696.jpg\" alt=\"WH Auden in 1936\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WH Auden in 1936.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trying to understand how a poem works is one thing: trying to understand what\u2019s wrong with it is another. \u201cRereading a poem of mine,\u201d Auden wrote, looking back, \u201c1st September, 1939, after it had been published I came to the line \u2018We must love one another or die\u2019 and said to myself: \u2018That\u2019s a damned lie! We must die anyway.\u2019 So, in the next edition, I altered it to \u2018We must love one another and die.\u2019 This didn\u2019t seem to do either, so I cut the stanza. Still no good. The whole poem, I realized, was infected with an incurable dishonesty \u2013 and must be scrapped.\u201d</p> <p>Auden was always inclined towards radical self-editing but \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d is unlike any of the other poems he attempted to rewrite and abandon: it is the most famous example in literary history of a writer attempting to revise his work, and of readers refusing to allow it. Auden may have attempted to hack up the poem and destroy it but it has been saved from dismemberment and death, time and again: \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d, among other things, is the world\u2019s greatest zombie poem. It won\u2019t die \u2013 and never will \u2013 because people want it to be true.</p> <p>Most famously and significantly, in the aftermath of 9/11, many American newspapers reprinted Auden\u2019s poem in its entirety: it was widely circulated and discussed online and in print. It seemed prophetic, wise and relevant, almost too good to be true. This is partly because it mentions September and New York, circulating fears, and the unmentionable odour of death, all in its first stanza. It was the right poem, in the right place, for a wrong time. At the end of it we come away with an image of some unnamed individual, in New York, speaking directly of their fears and concerns: a lonely, frightened figure, surveying a terrifying world outside. It was a work that spoke to the moment.</p> <p>Oddly, with Auden this had happened before. In the 1994 film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/four-weddings-and-a-funeral\" title=\"\">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a></em>, Auden\u2019s poem \u201cFuneral Blues\u201d \u2013 the one that begins \u201cStop all the clocks\u201d \u2013 is read at the funeral of a gay character, played by Simon Callow. To coincide with the release of the film, Faber published a pamphlet of 10 of Auden\u2019s poems, titled <em>Tell Me the Truth About Love</em>: there were reports of sales of more than 275,000 copies. According to the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesfenton\" title=\"\">James Fenton</a>, Auden\u2019s new-found popularity came about because \u201cit seems that a large number of people, since the Aids epidemic, have become familiar with the experience of funerals at which a devastated boyfriend has to pay tribute to his prematurely dead lover. So Auden\u2019s poem found an audience that needed it, nearly 60 years after its composition.\u201d</p> <p>My explanation for the long life and afterlife of \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d is that it\u2019s one of those poems that seems to provide simple answers to difficult questions, which is not necessarily a good thing.

      "bodyText": "There are many acclaimed poems that address themselves to the question of love. There are many that address themselves to the problems of war. There are others, both ancient and modern, that seem to speak directly to our contemporary condition, and to various crises, fears and threats of annihilation. There are poems that console, inspire and delight. And there are some poems \u2013 a very few \u2013 that do all of the above. WH Auden\u2019s \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d, written 80 years ago, is an example. \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d is undoubtedly one of the great poems of the 20th century, one that marks the beginning of the second world war and which readers have returned to at times of national and personal crisis. It is also a work that Auden came to despise, and whose troubled history therefore provides us with a rare glimpse of a writer in the act of self-invention and self-reinvention, and with a unique insight into the many ways in which a poem might be interpreted, misinterpreted, used, reused, appropriated and recycled. \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d is a lesson in how masterpieces are produced and consumed and become incorporated into people\u2019s lives \u2013 how, in the words of another of Auden\u2019s poems, \u201cIn Memory of WB Yeats\u201d, the work of a poet becomes \u201cmodified in the guts of the living\u201d. The poem was first published on 18 October 1939 in the American magazine the New Republic. Auden had arrived in New York earlier that year with his friend and fellow writer Christopher Isherwood. The two men had quickly established themselves on the US literary scene: schmoozing, carousing, making contact with editors, and undertaking speaking and lecturing engagements. In April 1939, Auden had met an 18-year-old, Chester Kallman, 14 years his junior, who was to become his life partner: in the new world, Auden was making a new life for himself. Back in Europe, meanwhile, the storm clouds were gathering. AJP Taylor, in his famous account in The Origins of the Second World War (1961), claimed that a second world war \u201cwas implicit since the moment when the first world war ended\u201d. It became explicit at exactly 4.30am on Friday 1 September 1939, when the German panzer divisions that had been gathering on the Polish border began their advance. The front page headline of the New York Times that day tapped out the news in telegraphese: GERMAN ARMY ATTACKS POLAND; CITIES BOMBED, PORT BLOCKADED; DANZIG IS ACCEPTED INTO REICH. On 3 September the British prime minister Neville Chamberlain broadcast to the nation on the BBC: the country, he announced, was at war with Germany. Auden\u2019s poem consists of 99 lines, written in trimeters, divided into nine 11-line stanzas with a shifting rhyme scheme, each stanza being composed of just one sentence so that \u2013 as the poet Joseph Brodsky pointed out \u2013 the thought unit corresponds exactly to the stanzaic unit, which corresponds also to the grammatical unit. Which is neat. Too neat. Because of course this is only the beginning of an understanding of how a poem works. It takes us only to the very edges of the piece, to the outskirts of its vast territory. In order properly to comprehend it we would need to know why Auden chose this rigorous, cramped, bastard form. And why did he begin the poem with an \u201cI\u201d, undoubtedly the most depressing and dreary little pronoun in the English language? I sit in one of the dives On Fifty-second Street Uncertain and afraid As the clever hopes expire Of a low dishonest decade: Who is this \u201cI\u201d? And why are they sitting in a dive? And is it real or is it imagined, this place? And why the double adjectives? Trying to understand how a poem works is one thing: trying to understand what\u2019s wrong with it is another. \u201cRereading a poem of mine,\u201d Auden wrote, looking back, \u201c1st September, 1939, after it had been published I came to the line \u2018We must love one another or die\u2019 and said to myself: \u2018That\u2019s a damned lie! We must die anyway.\u2019 So, in the next edition, I altered it to \u2018We must love one another and die.\u2019 This didn\u2019t seem to do either, so I cut the stanza. Still no good. The whole poem, I realized, was infected with an incurable dishonesty \u2013 and must be scrapped.\u201d Auden was always inclined towards radical self-editing but \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d is unlike any of the other poems he attempted to rewrite and abandon: it is the most famous example in literary history of a writer attempting to revise his work, and of readers refusing to allow it. Auden may have attempted to hack up the poem and destroy it but it has been saved from dismemberment and death, time and again: \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d, among other things, is the world\u2019s greatest zombie poem. It won\u2019t die \u2013 and never will \u2013 because people want it to be true. Most famously and significantly, in the aftermath of 9/11, many American newspapers reprinted Auden\u2019s poem in its entirety: it was widely circulated and discussed online and in print. It seemed prophetic, wise and relevant, almost too good to be true. This is partly because it mentions September and New York, circulating fears, and the unmentionable odour of death, all in its first stanza. It was the right poem, in the right place, for a wrong time. At the end of it we come away with an image of some unnamed individual, in New York, speaking directly of their fears and concerns: a lonely, frightened figure, surveying a terrifying world outside. It was a work that spoke to the moment. Oddly, with Auden this had happened before. In the 1994 film Four Weddings and a Funeral, Auden\u2019s poem \u201cFuneral Blues\u201d \u2013 the one that begins \u201cStop all the clocks\u201d \u2013 is read at the funeral of a gay character, played by Simon Callow. To coincide with the release of the film, Faber published a pamphlet of 10 of Auden\u2019s poems, titled Tell Me the Truth About Love: there were reports of sales of more than 275,000 copies. According to the poet James Fenton, Auden\u2019s new-found popularity came about because \u201cit seems that a large number of people, since the Aids epidemic, have become familiar with the experience of funerals at which a devastated boyfriend has to pay tribute to his prematurely dead lover. So Auden\u2019s poem found an audience that needed it, nearly 60 years after its composition.\u201d My explanation for the long life and afterlife of \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d is that it\u2019s one of those poems that seems to provide simple answers to difficult questions, which is not necessarily a good thing. In studying it I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that poetry can indeed uplift and sublimate and help us to make things good, but that it can also encourage us in false and sentimental ideas and emotions. Poetry can guide us, and it can lead us astray. And we have to acknowledge this, if we want to grant poetry its proper place in our lives. \u201cThe primary function of poetry, as of all the arts,\u201d wrote Auden, \u201cis to make us more aware of ourselves and the world around us. I do not know if such increased awareness makes us more moral or more efficient. I hope not. I think it makes us more human, and I am quite certain it makes us more difficult to deceive.\u201d Auden died in 1973, most of his best work produced in the 1930s and 40s.

Jenny McLachlan\u2019s The Land of Roar (Egmont), illustrated by Ben Mantle, is set in a world dreamed up by Arthur and Rose when they were younger, then forgotten \u2013 until Roar\u2019s evil scarecrow villain, Crowkey, captures their grandfather. Accompanied by wizard ninjas, cutthroat Lost Girls and wilful dragons, the twins must put aside their differences and return to Roar once more. This funny, captivating story is filled with the painful pangs of growing up and the transporting qualities of imagination.

And Jair Bolsonaro is to blame | David Miranda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nuremberg shattered this understanding. At Nuremberg, the allies recognized that a sovereign\u2019s systematic destruction of its own people was a matter of international concern and constituted an international crime.</p> <p>The Nuremberg understanding gave birth to the idea that the world community need not stand by idly when a nation commits atrocities against its own inhabitants. Many human rights activists today speak not simply of a <em>right</em> to intervene but of an affirmative <em>obligation</em> to do so. Activists understand that massive human rights abuses \u2013 crimes against humanity and genocide \u2013 never remain entirely local, even when committed exclusively within a state\u2019s borders. These atrocities inevitably create refugee problems that spill over into other nations, creating larger international crises.</p> <p>All the reasons that support the project of humanitarian intervention apply with equal, if not greater force, in the case of the environment. Massive environmental crimes, such as those presently unfolding in the Amazon, necessarily have a spill-over effect, as the degradation of the rainforest will do grave, and arguably irreversible, damage to our planet\u2019s climate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The degradation of the rainforest will do grave, and arguably irreversible, damage to our planet\u2019s climate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Admittedly, the concept of humanitarian intervention is not uncontroversial, especially as it is understood to authorize the threat or actual use of military force to put an end to massive human rights abuses. The doctrine can be manipulated to justify military intervention for less than humanitarian grounds.</p> <p>But the 2001 report on the Responsibility to Protect, prepared by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, offers a sound template for a workable practice of environmental intervention. The idea is that when a state fails to protect its own inhabitants, either by omission or commission, the international national community must take responsibility \u2013 not, in the first instance, by deploying military force, but through strong non-military means, such as trade sanctions and economic boycotts. All this can and should be applied to circumstances in which a nation fails to protect an environment the defense of which is a matter of global concern.</p> <p> Macron deserves credit for highlighting at the G7 summit Brazil\u2019s environmental crimes. The $20m in emergency funds pledged by the G7 to fight the thousands of fires presently burning will hardly solve the problem. Far more promising was Macron\u2019s threat to scuttle a trade deal with South American countries unless Bolsonaro acts in decisive fashion to stop the burning. In delivering this threat, Macron recognized that the responsibility to protect the environment is a matter of global concern and not a prerogative of a reprobate sovereign.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lawrence Douglas is the James J Grosfeld Professor of Law, Jurisprudence and Social Thought, at Amherst College, Massachusetts. He is presently writing a book on the legal and constitutional consequences of a possible refusal by President Trump to acknowledge defeat in the next election, to be published by Hachette in 2020.

At Nuremberg, the allies recognized that a sovereign\u2019s systematic destruction of its own people was a matter of international concern and constituted an international crime. The Nuremberg understanding gave birth to the idea that the world community need not stand by idly when a nation commits atrocities against its own inhabitants. Many human rights activists today speak not simply of a right to intervene but of an affirmative obligation to do so. Activists understand that massive human rights abuses \u2013 crimes against humanity and genocide \u2013 never remain entirely local, even when committed exclusively within a state\u2019s borders. These atrocities inevitably create refugee problems that spill over into other nations, creating larger international crises. All the reasons that support the project of humanitarian intervention apply with equal, if not greater force, in the case of the environment. Massive environmental crimes, such as those presently unfolding in the Amazon, necessarily have a spill-over effect, as the degradation of the rainforest will do grave, and arguably irreversible, damage to our planet\u2019s climate. Admittedly, the concept of humanitarian intervention is not uncontroversial, especially as it is understood to authorize the threat or actual use of military force to put an end to massive human rights abuses. The doctrine can be manipulated to justify military intervention for less than humanitarian grounds. But the 2001 report on the Responsibility to Protect, prepared by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, offers a sound template for a workable practice of environmental intervention. The idea is that when a state fails to protect its own inhabitants, either by omission or commission, the international national community must take responsibility \u2013 not, in the first instance, by deploying military force, but through strong non-military means, such as trade sanctions and economic boycotts. All this can and should be applied to circumstances in which a nation fails to protect an environment the defense of which is a matter of global concern. Macron deserves credit for highlighting at the G7 summit Brazil\u2019s environmental crimes. The $20m in emergency funds pledged by the G7 to fight the thousands of fires presently burning will hardly solve the problem. Far more promising was Macron\u2019s threat to scuttle a trade deal with South American countries unless Bolsonaro acts in decisive fashion to stop the burning. In delivering this threat, Macron recognized that the responsibility to protect the environment is a matter of global concern and not a prerogative of a reprobate sovereign.

Tip the sugar and water into a large saucepan and put on a medium heat, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved. Turn up the heat and boil the syrup until it reaches a honey-brown colour, then turn off the heat and stir in the bicarb. Quickly pour out the bubbling, molten caramel into your prepared tin and leave it to cool. To make the chocolate sauce, warm the coconut milk in a small pan, then stir in the chocolate until melted. To serve, put a couple of generous scoops of ice-cream in a bowl, crumble over some honeycomb and finish with a drizzle of chocolate sauce.",

      "bodyText": "Three days before Christmas, in 2015, Thorsten van Elten and his partner Karl swapped central London for rural East Sussex. \u201cI was fully ready for a change,\u201d says the German-born design retailer, who had lived in the West End for 20 years, after he moved to England to study interior design. \u201cKarl\u2019s family arrived for the holidays on 24 December, so it felt immediately like home.\u201d When the pair began looking to buy in the countryside, Van Elten knew a beamed cottage wasn\u2019t going to work \u2013 he is more than 6ft tall. \u201cWe wanted a house where we could dance underneath a disco ball. I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my days trying not to bump my head.\u201d The three-bedroom bungalow they bought near Battle, four miles from the sea and atop a hill, was built in 1978. Constructed from brick and black-stained timber, it has a huge decked terrace with an impressive fig tree, and a sloping, one-acre garden. The living area and kitchen are on one side of the house, and the three bedrooms, along with the bathrooms, are on the other. The terrace spans the whole of the living space, and a stylish, black-framed conservatory (which Van Elten calls the wintergarten) was added by a second owner, an architect. It is filled with cacti and succulents. The house is not without its 1970s touches: original exposed breezeblock walls \u2013 painted white \u2013 and square terracotta floor tiles in the kitchen, which were all in immaculate condition. The bathroom features the original sunken bath and golden plywood panelling, and timber ceilings throughout give it the feel of a cabin. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to do much to it,\u201d Van Elten says. You can tell a house is right when your existing furniture fits. And Van Elten has a lot, mostly contemporary pieces picked up from his days as a buyer at upmarket furniture store SCP, as well as vintage pieces. A 20-year-old Cappellini sofa, reupholstered in orange, sits in the living room alongside a Tepee sofa by Lucy Kurrein for SCP. Not everything has a designer label: there are two sets of classic German beer garden tables and benches, one in the kitchen, one on the terrace. Van Elten first made a name for himself with his online store, championing emerging designers, including Ed Carpenter and Alexander Taylor, and objects sourced from Germany, many of which have found their way into his home. Kitsch figurines and garden gnomes abound \u2013 the latter everywhere from the master bedroom to the bathroom. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a German thing,\u201d he says. \u201cMine are handmade by a family business in the former East Germany, which has been going since 1874. They are entwined with German history: the family was forbidden to produce them for a long time, until the state needed hard currency, so they were allowed to produce them again, only for export. I don\u2019t like all garden gnomes, but I love these.\u201d A family of woolly sheep, by designer Hanns-Peter Krafft, keep watch outside the living room door. \u201cThe house was rented for about 10 years before we bought it, and the garden was uncared for,\u201d says Van Elten. \u201cIn our first summer, I was really excited about all the fruit that was growing, but the animals got to it before me. Last year the squirrels nicked all my peaches, and this year my little apricot tree has been stripped bare by a deer. But I find it relaxing and really good exercise. Just walking up and down it several times is a workout in itself.\u201d Creatures find their way inside, too. \u201cThere\u2019s an air vent that invites the odd mouse. And we sometimes hear them in the wooden ceiling. In another room we can hear pigeons, magpies and seagulls running around on the roof.

Khan was escorted from No 10 by an armed police officer following a meeting with Johnson\u2019s strategist, Dominic Cummings, after being accused of being dishonest about her contact with the former chancellor Philip Hammond and one of his ex-advisers. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme, Javid said suggestions that Downing Street was not allowing him enough authority over the Treasury is \u201ca picture painted by government\u2019s opponents\u201d. He also insisted it was his decision to cancel his first major speech on the economy 24 hours before he had been expected to deliver it in Birmingham this week after the announcement of the Queen\u2019s speech was leaked. Khan is the fourth young woman in a month to be axed from the prime minister\u2019s network of advisers and senior staffers, leaving Javid without a media adviser before Wednesday\u2019s spending review, where he will lay out details of a \u00a314bn allocation for schools and new police funding. Javid told the Today programme: \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss any personnel issues, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. \u201cThe relationship is fantastic with the prime minister. Before he was prime minister, he is someone I got on with incredibly well. \u201cIt\u2019s a real privilege to work with him, to work closely so well on people\u2019s priorities.\u201d On his relationship with Cummings, Javid replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss personnel relationships. The prime minister is my boss and we work together, along with other cabinet colleagues, to deliver, so I am not here to talk about particular individuals that are advisers in Downing Street.\u201d He added: \u201cIf you look at the moment the new government was formed, how much of activity and focus has taken place. \u201cFE today, yesterday was schools, record investment in NHS and 20 new hospitals being modernised as well as getting us a deal from Brussels, that only happens when the government is working well together. \u201cThat is what you see not just between me and the PM but across the board.\u201d The former home secretary was more willing to discuss the reasons for cancelling his speech on Tuesday after Downing Street, rather than the Treasury, announced a proposed cut to fuel duty that had been briefed to the Sunday newspapers. The one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been expected to take place later this year, is fast-tracked to take place on Wednesday \u2013 the day after MPs return to parliament \u2013 fuelling speculation the government could be planning an early general election. Javid said: \u201cThat was my decision not to have the speech, by then we worked out that for some reason there was a leak around the Queen\u2019s speech announcement. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be sensible to make a big economic speech when clearly there wouldn\u2019t have been focus on that, there would have been focus on the Queen\u2019s speech. It was right that decision was made. I am happy with that. \u201cSometimes people read too much into this and deliberately twist things that don\u2019t exist.\u201d Javid also backed the decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to the Brexit deadline at the end of October. He said: \u201cIt is quite usual this time of year; parliament goes into what\u2019s called a conference recess and it doesn\u2019t usually sit for some time in September and early October. It\u2019s right because we are focusing on the people\u2019s priorities.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For Muntaser, it\u2019s the memory of militiamen raiding his village in Darfur. For Ahmad, who fled Afghanistan as a child, it\u2019s the terrible vision of his father murdering his mother and sister. Abdul saw his home city devastated by Saudi bombs.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of migrants have crossed deserts, the snows of the Alps, or Balkan forests carrying the weight of similarly traumatic events, to find a new life in an increasingly inhospitable Europe. Once they get there \u2013 if they do \u2013 how do they begin to process the painful experiences that prompted their journeys?</p> <p>Depression, PTSD, anxiety, self-harming, insomnia and panic attacks are among the growing mental health issues faced by asylum seekers who find themselves trapped in fear and uncertainty in Europe. In camps on the outskirts of major cities, or in safe houses, or on the pavements of European capitals, a million people await their destiny. Aid groups such as <a href=\"https://www.msf.org.uk/uk-jobs?&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1_PqBRBIEiwA71rmteIftopsXVliYB0TthcpBpwtOyU4bP2mE1nYQoaycbWEP25nOVL4VRoCppEQAvD_BwE\" title=\"\">M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res</a> (MSF) have been forced to step in to provide psychiatric care for this population of often highly disturbed people.</p> <p>Where do you start? Gordana Maksimovic, a psychologist with MSF in Belgrade, says that a large part of her role is listening to people\u2019s stories and offering them a human response. \u201cTorture works by isolating you from others,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only way to help is to reconnect on a human level and bring people back to society, where they belong. To reduce stigma by saying that they are not abnormal \u2013 but that what has happened to them is.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>When they learned of my sex change at the university, I was sacked\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Moona, 33, left Iran in 2018 and now lives in a safe house </strong><strong>in Belgrade, Serbia</strong></p> <p>Moona was thrilled when her wife told her she was expecting a baby \u2013 and decided in that moment never to hide her true identity from her child. Though she had dreamed of being pregnant herself, Moona was not yet able to be the woman she is today; she was then living as a male Iranian university professor, married to her cousin. After learning of the pregnancy, she decided to transition, \u201cbecause I wanted to be a true mother to my child, rather than a false father\u201d.</p> <p>Moona was born and raised in a small town in western Iran. \u201cI remember once asking my mother if I could wear makeup before attending a wedding,\u201d she says. \u201cShe told me that my father would kill both of us if I did. That\u2019s when I understood the danger of expressing my true self in public, and decided to follow the strict rules of society.\u201d</p> <p>Instead she threw herself into her education. On the advice of her family, and a doctor to whom she expressed her gender identity, she married, but after<strong> </strong>four years decided to transition. Iran forbids homosexuality, but it does allow citizens to undergo state-funded gender affirmation surgery. At the beginning of 2015, tired of living as a man, Moona signed up.</p> <p>Soon after, she fell in love with a man and remarried. It cost her dearly, however, as her ex-wife \u2013 who refused to allow her to see her daughter \u2013 threatened to expose her. \u201cWhen they learned of my sex change at work, I was sacked,\u201d Moona says. \u201cA few nights later, my father came and told me that my brother would kill me if I didn\u2019t leave. So in August 2018 I made it to Serbia on a fake British passport that a smuggler had given me. At the border I was kept in detention with 24 men in the same small room without any protection \u2013 they wanted to force me to return home.\u201d</p> <p>Today Moona lives in Belgrade, and suffers from panic and anxiety attacks, far from both her daughter and the man she loves. She has been granted asylum and offered resettlement in France, but is waiting for details. Meanwhile, she lives in a safe house for vulnerable people.</p> <p>A few months ago she began undergoing therapy at the MSF clinic. \u201cTherapy is helping me \u2013 we meet regularly. But things are changing very slowly. I\u2019m lonely and homesick, and feel out of control of my life.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>She, too, likes to paint, and hopes to exhibit her work. \u201cIn a normal world, my choice would have granted me happiness. But taking possession of my sexuality has cost me everything I had.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Every day I live with the terror of seeing my father\u2019s face in the mirror\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ahmad, 16, fled Afghanistan aged </strong><strong>seven and now lives in a migrants\u2019 camp in Belgrade</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a2400f4dff90141a920eadb8454edb5e948d9e02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2400f4dff90141a920eadb8454edb5e948d9e02/1490_1178_6723_4034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmad fled Afghanistan after seeing his father kill his mother and sister.

I felt alone.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ahmad says he will never forget the crazed look in his father\u2019s eyes. Sent into a rage by Ahmad\u2019s sister\u2019s choice to marry a man of whom he didn\u2019t approve, his father stabbed her in front of the whole family. When their mother tried to intervene, she was killed, too. The young Ahmad, then just seven years old, looked on paralysed with horror.</p> <p>He had no choice but to flee his village. \u201cMy uncle said that if I stayed, my father would have also killed me,\u201d he says. \u201cHe paid a smuggler to take me to Iran.\u201d For two hours he was locked in the boot of a car speeding along the bumpy roads of Afghanistan. When he reached Iran, he became one of more than 2 million asylum seekers in the country \u2013 800,000 of them children. Like many Afghan migrants, Ahmad found himself homeless, and lived on the streets for two years. \u201cI was eating from the garbage. I got by begging for money,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At 10, Ahmad began working illegally for a construction company; after an injury on site, he chose to leave and head to Turkey. His journey continued for another year, passing through Istanbul before moving on to Bulgaria, where he experienced terrible cruelty and abuse. \u201cThere is no respect for migrants in Bulgaria,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the camps, minors are victims of sexual violence and the police don\u2019t care. I witnessed the rape of a boy. If you were alone, you became an easy target. I was sexually harassed a few times.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018 he arrived in Belgrade, where scars on his body caught the attention of Serbian volunteers, who urged him to go to the MSF clinic in the city. \u201cThose wounds were self-inflicted,\u201d Ahmad says. \u201cI was depressed, suicidal, and I began self-harming. I tried to end my life a few times. I felt alone.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmad now lives in a safe house for young people, and sees a psychologist regularly. He spends most of his days with his friend Mohammed, a fellow Afghan who was his travelling companion during the arduous journey from Bulgaria to Serbia. Therapists say their close friendship has helped them to share their ordeal. </p> <p>Ahmad\u2019s first asylum request has been rejected. He says he didn\u2019t have the courage to reveal what he describes now as \u201cthe incident\u201d: witnessing his father murder his mother and sister. \u201cI hid this story from the authorities because I felt ashamed. But every day I live with the terror of seeing the reflection of his face in the mirror.\u201d</p> <p>According to Maksimovic, who works with Ahmad and other young migrants, this is a common problem. \u201cMinors who have experienced the worst trauma are often denied refugee status, because they feel too ashamed to report the abuses they have experienced.\u201d</p> <p>Memories continue to torment Ahmad, but he is starting to feel better. He attends school and goes to an art class in the afternoons; he spends much of his time in Belgrade, drawing the faces of the migrants he meets in the clinic. His dream is to exhibit in the city\u2019s galleries.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019m a grown</strong><strong>up now.

My head is still dealing with many of the things I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Aazar and his father, a doctor, left Iran in 2018. \u201cMy father paid a smuggler in Turkey, and after that we tried to reach Croatia from Bosnia. But it was a disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Every year, thousands of asylum seekers who have been captured by police while attempting to cross the border into the EU are brutally beaten before being sent back. Migrants call it The Game. \u201cOne day, as we were running through the forest in Bosnia, the police caught me. My father made it. The smuggler promised my dad he would have me brought back to him in a few days. But he never answered my father\u2019s calls.\u201d</p> <p>Father and son have not seen each other since. Aazar ended up in Belgrade, where he makes hamburgers in a burger van for \u20ac350 a month.</p> <p>\u201cMy father made it to Belgium,\u201d Aazar says. \u201cLucky him! The funny thing is he doesn\u2019t have a job, so I send him money \u2013 around \u20ac150 a month. At the end of the month I have no money left.\u201d</p> <p>His shift ends around midnight and, often too tired to return home to the camp, he spends many nights on the banks of the Danube and in parks, sleeping in playgrounds. He sometimes struggles to control his anger. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m a grownup now. I have to make it on my own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMinors like Aazar are experiencing a developmental crisis and a life crisis at the same time,\u201d Maksimovic tells me. \u201cImagine having teenage issues while facing this journey. Everything from the noise at night in the camps to border violence worsens their situation.\u201d Some children enter local schools, but the contrast with their peers can make adjusting harder. \u201cSchools are good tools of integration, but at the same time these kids see their peers with families, living a more fortunate life, which reminds them that they are disadvantaged.\u201d</p> <p>Aazar\u2019s dream is to reach Belgium and reunite with his father; this will bring him stability, but take him away from the treatment he is currently getting from Maksimovic. \u201cThe most frustrating part of our job is that I start therapy with a migrant and then, suddenly, he disappears to continue his journey,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s even more frustrating when you think about the thousands of people out there who suffer and never even make it to a clinic.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>I want to return to my studies, to think about something else\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Maha</strong><strong>, 23, fled from Syria and has lived in Greece for 18 months with her three children</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"99729d07757c4ffb79684cf8faca5d68ecfba946\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99729d07757c4ffb79684cf8faca5d68ecfba946/0_404_8056_4833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A refugee family who escaped war in Syria and now live in Athens: Maha with her three children\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maha: \u2018All we do is eat and sleep, and worry.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 23, Maha is sure of one thing: she may have escaped the bloody conflict that has engulfed her country but, 18 months after reaching Europe, she is still captive to it. \u201cI feel as if I am living the war all over again, although this time it is a war that is fought within the four walls of my apartment, a psychological war that inhabits my mind.\u201d She could write a book about the suffering of refugees, says the bubbly mother of three. \u201cActually, when I get the time, when my mind quietens a bit, that is what I have decided to do.\u201d</p> <p>A former volunteer nurse, Maha arrived in Greece ahead of her husband, Hussein. She tried and failed nine times to cross the land border from Turkey. Each time the refugees with whom she was travelling were pushed and beaten back by frontier guards. \u201cThey hit us, kicked us and even took the pacifier out of my baby\u2019s mouth,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we kept saying, \u2018We\u2019re not going to give up trying. There\u2019s freedom there, we\u2019ll be back.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It is that resilience that Melanie Vasilopoulou and her fellow psychologists try to nurture when treating asylum seekers in Athens. Flashbacks, hallucinations and PTSD are among the most common symptoms seen by Vasilopoulou. This is all accentuated by the long waits asylum seekers are subjected to by Greece\u2019s overwhelmed asylum service.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the limbo, this endless state of waiting for asylum claims to be processed that breaks people,\u201d she says. \u201cI tell them to focus on their resilience, not on their problems. After all, we\u2019re talking about incredibly strong people who have done so much to get here.\u201d</p> <p>For Maha, whose youngest child is five months old, the process of acquiring the right paperwork has been relatively easy \u2013 because she\u2019s Syrian. But although a recognised refugee, she still lacks the travel documents that would enable her to leave Greece and visit her three siblings, who left Idlib in 2014 and are scattered across Europe.</p> <p>Depression has given way to a growing sense of displacement. \u201cI feel so lonely, so cut off,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI want so much to return to my studies so I can think about something else. I live in an apartment 12 metro stops from the city centre. I hardly ever see Hussein, because he doesn\u2019t have papers and so lives somewhere else. All we do is eat and sleep, and worry.\u201d</p> <p>She has been seeing Vasilopoulou since November. \u201cI tell Melanie all my problems. I don\u2019t have anyone else and she is like my friend. Greece is beautiful, but it is a poor country. I don\u2019t feel I can have any dreams here.

Three years later, his journey in search of a new life is ongoing. Now living on the periphery of Brussels, he suffers from panic attacks and insomnia. \u201cI\u2019ve lost the desire to be around people,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any future here. You think your life couldn\u2019t get worse, but it actually does.\u201d</p> <p>Abdul\u2019s extraordinary journey took him from Yemen to Malaysia (one of the few countries where Yemenis can work without a visa), then to Sudan and Armenia, where he spent a year in a UNHCR camp. He moved on, stopping in Mali and paying a human trafficker to take him across the desert to Morocco. \u201cThe desert was a death sentence if you attempted the crossing yourself. They smuggled us for four days in the desert and I reached Melilla.\u201d He was finally in Europe \u2013 a migrants\u2019 camp in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/17/melilla-migrants-eu-spain-morocco\" title=\"\">tiny Spanish city on the north coast of Africa</a>. \u201cThe camp was made for 100 people, but at the time contained 1,000. You cannot breathe there. There were fights every day, and the police humiliated the migrants.\u201d</p> <p>He wanted to head for the UK, to get help from the Yemeni community in London. \u201cBut the traffickers asked for \u00a315,000 to reach London. That\u2019s why I chose Belgium.\u201d He was first transferred to Madrid by the Spanish government, and then in March 2018 got to the migrant camp on the outskirts of Brussels with a trafficker. </p> <p>It was here that he was offered therapy by MSF, who carried out a medical checkup at the camp. Abdul now travels once a week to the city to meet a therapist. \u201cWith therapy, things started to get a little better, but I still feel this isn\u2019t my home.\u201d The therapy sessions are of limited value while the rest of his life is so chaotic; because the rooms in the camp are crowded and noisy, Abdul prefers to spend most of his time in the city, walking the streets.</p> <p>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Duvivier, mental health activity manager for MSF in Brussels, sees many common symptoms among the migrants she works with: \u201cLoss of hope, isolation, intense sadness, and a lack of will to do anything towards meeting their goal \u2013 because they feel they have lost that goal.\u201d</p> <p>Abdul, who studied engineering in Yemen, and would like to continue his studies, has had one request to stay in Belgium rejected already.

Financed by the Sudanese government, they were responsible for the deaths of 200,000 to 400,000 people, in a war that began in 2003.</p> <p>Aged 26, Muntaser was held in prison and tortured, after being accused of supporting opposition forces. \u201cI was a farmer, and during the conflict I helped collect food in my village which was distributed among the villages plundered by the Janjaweed,\u201d he says. Months later, he was released on condition that he collaborate as a spy. \u201cObviously, I didn\u2019t agree. With that refusal began my flight.\u201d</p> <p>In March 2016, Muntaser left Sudan, crossed the desert and arrived in Sabha, Libya. He had gone from one disaster to another. \u201cThe country was unstable. Things worsened when fighting broke out between the militias and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/29/libyan-strongman-khalifa-haftar-is-no-democrat-un-envoy\" title=\"\">Libyan National Army</a>. If they captured you, they accused you of having joined one group or the other. I found myself in a similar situation to the one I had left.\u201d</p> <p>After some months, Muntaser boarded a dinghy bound for Sicily and then headed for the Alps. Now he is stuck in Belgium \u2013 unable to afford a clandestine route to London, where there is a big South Sudanese community that could help him find a job. When it gets really cold, he spends the night at a local family\u2019s home, arranged through a community initiative to find migrants a bed.<strong> </strong>His wife and two daughters are still in Darfur.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d all like to live a better life in Europe,\u201d he says, \u201cbut when we got here, things are not as we had hoped. We live in fear, and all these things make our lives more stressful and unhappy.\u201d He has been suffering from flashbacks. \u201cI see the children who were killed in front of me in Darfur. In this state of despair, I have considered hurting myself.\u201d</p> <p>The therapy he attends at an MSF clinic has begun to help; today Muntaser works as a volunteer, helping new arrivals settle in Belgium. \u201cAt first it felt strange to go to a psychologist,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my mind, that is the doctor for crazy people.\u201d But he now encourages others to seek similar help.</p> <p>Overcoming this hurdle is part of the battle for the MSF therapists: \u201cThere is a big stigmatisation of psychologists,\u201d says Maksimovic. \u201cSometimes the clinic is the first time a migrant has heard of therapy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel bad for my friends who are not getting any help here in Belgium,\u201d says Muntaser. \u201cI want them to know that despite everything, there is still hope.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>The </strong><strong>intelligence service </strong><strong>arrested two fellow communists.

The Iranian had never wanted to make the journey to \u201csuch a different world\u201d, but when the regime\u2019s crackdown on communists intensified she was left with little choice. \u201cI\u2019d already experienced prison \u2013 I knew what it was like to be tortured. I was very scared,\u201d she says, her eyes fixed on the floor of a room in the Athens office of MSF. \u201cIn Iran it\u2019s illegal to be a communist. They had arrested my leader and mentor. The intelligence service was after me next.\u201d</p> <p>For the 46-year-old, escape meant survival but also the beginning of \u201ca desire to move forward\u201d. Almost three years later, afflicted by health problems, unable to leave Athens and struggling to survive on a UN stipend of \u20ac150 a month, she feels more marooned than ever. The instincts that once prompted the political activist to board a train from Tehran to Tabriz, take a car to the border city of Bazargan and trek, with the aid of smugglers, into Turkey have been replaced by feelings of helplessness.</p> <p>Arghavan\u2019s days are spent walking her dog, visiting an MSF doctor for the diabetes she has developed and attending monthly counselling sessions. It is not a life she ever envisaged. \u201cI wanted to be what I am, an atheist and a feminist, and all of that I found in communism,\u201d says the former driving instructor, who has a hammer and sickle tattooed above her left wrist. \u201cToday I feel like a mouse in a trap.\u201d</p> <p>Like many, Arghavan never intended to stay in Greece. Her destination was the UK, and until her arrival on Samos, the eastern Aegean island opposite Turkey, that is where she thought she was heading. \u201cI had my son, Hamed, with me because he didn\u2019t want me to make the journey alone. We paid smugglers to get to England but they lied, again and again.\u201d</p> <p>Samos meant seven months of detainment in a desperately overcrowded camp. It was another two years before the asylum process began, a drill in mastering the art of patience. \u201cThe only thing I have learned is to be patient,\u201d she says, apologising as she begins to weep. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea when my application will be ready. So many months have passed.\u201d</p> <p>Fears of her asylum request being rejected have been compounded by the other thing that dominates her life: Yasmin, the 18-year-old daughter she was forced to leave behind. Meanwhile Hamed, 28, made his way to Germany as a stowaway on a truck over a year ago.</p> <p>Around 70,000 refugees are now in Greece, with the vast majority slated to remain in the country, given the closure of borders elsewhere. \u201cI want to move forward. If the regime were to change I\u2019d go back to Iran, but that\u2019s not an option. I suffer every day here, but I also have a dream \u2013 to go to Germany to be with my son.\u201d<br><em>Interview by Helena Smith</em></p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "For Muntaser, it\u2019s the memory of militiamen raiding his village in Darfur. For Ahmad, who fled Afghanistan as a child, it\u2019s the terrible vision of his father murdering his mother and sister. Abdul saw his home city devastated by Saudi bombs. Hundreds of thousands of migrants have crossed deserts, the snows of the Alps, or Balkan forests carrying the weight of similarly traumatic events, to find a new life in an increasingly inhospitable Europe. Once they get there \u2013 if they do \u2013 how do they begin to process the painful experiences that prompted their journeys? Depression, PTSD, anxiety, self-harming, insomnia and panic attacks are among the growing mental health issues faced by asylum seekers who find themselves trapped in fear and uncertainty in Europe. In camps on the outskirts of major cities, or in safe houses, or on the pavements of European capitals, a million people await their destiny. Aid groups such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) have been forced to step in to provide psychiatric care for this population of often highly disturbed people. Where do you start? Gordana Maksimovic, a psychologist with MSF in Belgrade, says that a large part of her role is listening to people\u2019s stories and offering them a human response. \u201cTorture works by isolating you from others,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only way to help is to reconnect on a human level and bring people back to society, where they belong. To reduce stigma by saying that they are not abnormal \u2013 but that what has happened to them is.\u201d \u2018When they learned of my sex change at the university, I was sacked\u2019 Moona, 33, left Iran in 2018 and now lives in a safe house in Belgrade, Serbia Moona was thrilled when her wife told her she was expecting a baby \u2013 and decided in that moment never to hide her true identity from her child. Though she had dreamed of being pregnant herself, Moona was not yet able to be the woman she is today; she was then living as a male Iranian university professor, married to her cousin. After learning of the pregnancy, she decided to transition, \u201cbecause I wanted to be a true mother to my child, rather than a false father\u201d. Moona was born and raised in a small town in western Iran. \u201cI remember once asking my mother if I could wear makeup before attending a wedding,\u201d she says. \u201cShe told me that my father would kill both of us if I did. That\u2019s when I understood the danger of expressing my true self in public, and decided to follow the strict rules of society.\u201d Instead she threw herself into her education. On the advice of her family, and a doctor to whom she expressed her gender identity, she married, but after four years decided to transition. Iran forbids homosexuality, but it does allow citizens to undergo state-funded gender affirmation surgery. At the beginning of 2015, tired of living as a man, Moona signed up. Soon after, she fell in love with a man and remarried. It cost her dearly, however, as her ex-wife \u2013 who refused to allow her to see her daughter \u2013 threatened to expose her. \u201cWhen they learned of my sex change at work, I was sacked,\u201d Moona says. \u201cA few nights later, my father came and told me that my brother would kill me if I didn\u2019t leave. So in August 2018 I made it to Serbia on a fake British passport that a smuggler had given me. At the border I was kept in detention with 24 men in the same small room without any protection \u2013 they wanted to force me to return home.\u201d Today Moona lives in Belgrade, and suffers from panic and anxiety attacks, far from both her daughter and the man she loves. She has been granted asylum and offered resettlement in France, but is waiting for details. Meanwhile, she lives in a safe house for vulnerable people. A few months ago she began undergoing therapy at the MSF clinic. \u201cTherapy is helping me \u2013 we meet regularly. But things are changing very slowly. I\u2019m lonely and homesick, and feel out of control of my life.\u201d She, too, likes to paint, and hopes to exhibit her work. \u201cIn a normal world, my choice would have granted me happiness. But taking possession of my sexuality has cost me everything I had.\u201d \u2018Every day I live with the terror of seeing my father\u2019s face in the mirror\u2019 Ahmad, 16, fled Afghanistan aged seven and now lives in a migrants\u2019 camp in Belgrade Ahmad says he will never forget the crazed look in his father\u2019s eyes. Sent into a rage by Ahmad\u2019s sister\u2019s choice to marry a man of whom he didn\u2019t approve, his father stabbed her in front of the whole family. When their mother tried to intervene, she was killed, too. The young Ahmad, then just seven years old, looked on paralysed with horror. He had no choice but to flee his village. \u201cMy uncle said that if I stayed, my father would have also killed me,\u201d he says. \u201cHe paid a smuggler to take me to Iran.\u201d For two hours he was locked in the boot of a car speeding along the bumpy roads of Afghanistan. When he reached Iran, he became one of more than 2 million asylum seekers in the country \u2013 800,000 of them children. Like many Afghan migrants, Ahmad found himself homeless, and lived on the streets for two years. \u201cI was eating from the garbage. I got by begging for money,\u201d he says. At 10, Ahmad began working illegally for a construction company; after an injury on site, he chose to leave and head to Turkey. His journey continued for another year, passing through Istanbul before moving on to Bulgaria, where he experienced terrible cruelty and abuse. \u201cThere is no respect for migrants in Bulgaria,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the camps, minors are victims of sexual violence and the police don\u2019t care. I witnessed the rape of a boy. If you were alone, you became an easy target. I was sexually harassed a few times.\u201d In 2018 he arrived in Belgrade, where scars on his body caught the attention of Serbian volunteers, who urged him to go to the MSF clinic in the city. \u201cThose wounds were self-inflicted,\u201d Ahmad says. \u201cI was depressed, suicidal, and I began self-harming. I tried to end my life a few times. I felt alone.\u201d Ahmad now lives in a safe house for young people, and sees a psychologist regularly. He spends most of his days with his friend Mohammed, a fellow Afghan who was his travelling companion during the arduous journey from Bulgaria to Serbia. Therapists say their close friendship has helped them to share their ordeal. Ahmad\u2019s first asylum request has been rejected. He says he didn\u2019t have the courage to reveal what he describes now as \u201cthe incident\u201d: witnessing his father murder his mother and sister. \u201cI hid this story from the authorities because I felt ashamed. But every day I live with the terror of seeing the reflection of his face in the mirror.\u201d According to Maksimovic, who works with Ahmad and other young migrants, this is a common problem. \u201cMinors who have experienced the worst trauma are often denied refugee status, because they feel too ashamed to report the abuses they have experienced.\u201d Memories continue to torment Ahmad, but he is starting to feel better. He attends school and goes to an art class in the afternoons; he spends much of his time in Belgrade, drawing the faces of the migrants he meets in the clinic. His dream is to exhibit in the city\u2019s galleries. \u2018I\u2019m a grownup now. I have to make it on my own\u2019 Aazar, 16, was separated from his father after they left Iran in 2018 and now lives in a migrants\u2019 camp in Belgrade At just 16, Aazar\u2019s hair has begun to turn grey. \u201cThey say it is because of stress,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot \u2013 too much. My head is still dealing with many of the things I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Aazar and his father, a doctor, left Iran in 2018. \u201cMy father paid a smuggler in Turkey, and after that we tried to reach Croatia from Bosnia. But it was a disaster.\u201d Every year, thousands of asylum seekers who have been captured by police while attempting to cross the border into the EU are brutally beaten before being sent back. Migrants call it The Game. \u201cOne day, as we were running through the forest in Bosnia, the police caught me. My father made it. The smuggler promised my dad he would have me brought back to him in a few days. But he never answered my father\u2019s calls.\u201d Father and son have not seen each other since. Aazar ended up in Belgrade, where he makes hamburgers in a burger van for \u20ac350 a month. \u201cMy father made it to Belgium,\u201d Aazar says. \u201cLucky him! The funny thing is he doesn\u2019t have a job, so I send him money \u2013 around \u20ac150 a month. At the end of the month I have no money left.\u201d His shift ends around midnight and, often too tired to return home to the camp, he spends many nights on the banks of the Danube and in parks, sleeping in playgrounds. He sometimes struggles to control his anger. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m a grownup now. I have to make it on my own.\u201d \u201cMinors like Aazar are experiencing a developmental crisis and a life crisis at the same time,\u201d Maksimovic tells me. \u201cImagine having teenage issues while facing this journey. Everything from the noise at night in the camps to border violence worsens their situation.\u201d Some children enter local schools, but the contrast with their peers can make adjusting harder. \u201cSchools are good tools of integration, but at the same time these kids see their peers with families, living a more fortunate life, which reminds them that they are disadvantaged.\u201d Aazar\u2019s dream is to reach Belgium and reunite with his father; this will bring him stability, but take him away from the treatment he is currently getting from Maksimovic. \u201cThe most frustrating part of our job is that I start therapy with a migrant and then, suddenly, he disappears to continue his journey,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s even more frustrating when you think about the thousands of people out there who suffer and never even make it to a clinic.\u201d \u2018I want to return to my studies, to think about something else\u2019 Maha, 23, fled from Syria and has lived in Greece for 18 months with her three children At 23, Maha is sure of one thing: she may have escaped the bloody conflict that has engulfed her country but, 18 months after reaching Europe, she is still captive to it. \u201cI feel as if I am living the war all over again, although this time it is a war that is fought within the four walls of my apartment, a psychological war that inhabits my mind.\u201d She could write a book about the suffering of refugees, says the bubbly mother of three. \u201cActually, when I get the time, when my mind quietens a bit, that is what I have decided to do.\u201d A former volunteer nurse, Maha arrived in Greece ahead of her husband, Hussein. She tried and failed nine times to cross the land border from Turkey. Each time the refugees with whom she was travelling were pushed and beaten back by frontier guards. \u201cThey hit us, kicked us and even took the pacifier out of my baby\u2019s mouth,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we kept saying, \u2018We\u2019re not going to give up trying. There\u2019s freedom there, we\u2019ll be back.\u2019\u201d It is that resilience that Melanie Vasilopoulou and her fellow psychologists try to nurture when treating asylum seekers in Athens. Flashbacks, hallucinations and PTSD are among the most common symptoms seen by Vasilopoulou. This is all accentuated by the long waits asylum seekers are subjected to by Greece\u2019s overwhelmed asylum service. \u201cIt\u2019s the limbo, this endless state of waiting for asylum claims to be processed that breaks people,\u201d she says. \u201cI tell them to focus on their resilience, not on their problems. After all, we\u2019re talking about incredibly strong people who have done so much to get here.\u201d For Maha, whose youngest child is five months old, the process of acquiring the right paperwork has been relatively easy \u2013 because she\u2019s Syrian. But although a recognised refugee, she still lacks the travel documents that would enable her to leave Greece and visit her three siblings, who left Idlib in 2014 and are scattered across Europe. Depression has given way to a growing sense of displacement. \u201cI feel so lonely, so cut off,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI want so much to return to my studies so I can think about something else. I live in an apartment 12 metro stops from the city centre. I hardly ever see Hussein, because he doesn\u2019t have papers and so lives somewhere else. All we do is eat and sleep, and worry.\u201d She has been seeing Vasilopoulou since November. \u201cI tell Melanie all my problems. I don\u2019t have anyone else and she is like my friend. Greece is beautiful, but it is a poor country. I don\u2019t feel I can have any dreams here. It\u2019s not where I want to be.\u201d Interview by Helena Smith \u2018I was smuggled for four days across the desert\u2019 Abdul, 26, left Yemen in 2016 and now lives in a migrants\u2019 camp near Brussels Abdul hasn\u2019t been able to sleep deeply since 11 February 2016, when Saudi bombing raids in Sana\u2019a, Yemen, forced him to leave his country and his family. Three years later, his journey in search of a new life is ongoing. Now living on the periphery of Brussels, he suffers from panic attacks and insomnia. \u201cI\u2019ve lost the desire to be around people,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any future here. You think your life couldn\u2019t get worse, but it actually does.\u201d Abdul\u2019s extraordinary journey took him from Yemen to Malaysia (one of the few countries where Yemenis can work without a visa), then to Sudan and Armenia, where he spent a year in a UNHCR camp. He moved on, stopping in Mali and paying a human trafficker to take him across the desert to Morocco. \u201cThe desert was a death sentence if you attempted the crossing yourself. They smuggled us for four days in the desert and I reached Melilla.\u201d He was finally in Europe \u2013 a migrants\u2019 camp in the tiny Spanish city on the north coast of Africa. \u201cThe camp was made for 100 people, but at the time contained 1,000. You cannot breathe there. There were fights every day, and the police humiliated the migrants.\u201d He wanted to head for the UK, to get help from the Yemeni community in London. \u201cBut the traffickers asked for \u00a315,000 to reach London. That\u2019s why I chose Belgium.\u201d He was first transferred to Madrid by the Spanish government, and then in March 2018 got to the migrant camp on the outskirts of Brussels with a trafficker. It was here that he was offered therapy by MSF, who carried out a medical checkup at the camp. Abdul now travels once a week to the city to meet a therapist. \u201cWith therapy, things started to get a little better, but I still feel this isn\u2019t my home.\u201d The therapy sessions are of limited value while the rest of his life is so chaotic; because the rooms in the camp are crowded and noisy, Abdul prefers to spend most of his time in the city, walking the streets. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Duvivier, mental health activity manager for MSF in Brussels, sees many common symptoms among the migrants she works with: \u201cLoss of hope, isolation, intense sadness, and a lack of will to do anything towards meeting their goal \u2013 because they feel they have lost that goal.\u201d Abdul, who studied engineering in Yemen, and would like to continue his studies, has had one request to stay in Belgium rejected already. While he prepares to reapply, all he can do is walk the streets, and wait for something to change. \u2018I want people to know that, in spite of everything, there is hope\u2019 Muntaser, 30, left Darfur in 2016 and now lives in Belgium Muntaser was 13 when he first saw the militiamen in his village in Darfur. \u201cThey confiscated all of our possessions, weapons, knives,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember children and women being killed in front of me.\u201d A member of one of the majority African ethnic groups, his family were among the victims of genocide perpetrated by the Janjaweed, a group of Arab militiamen. Financed by the Sudanese government, they were responsible for the deaths of 200,000 to 400,000 people, in a war that began in 2003. Aged 26, Muntaser was held in prison and tortured, after being accused of supporting opposition forces. \u201cI was a farmer, and during the conflict I helped collect food in my village which was distributed among the villages plundered by the Janjaweed,\u201d he says. Months later, he was released on condition that he collaborate as a spy. \u201cObviously, I didn\u2019t agree. With that refusal began my flight.\u201d In March 2016, Muntaser left Sudan, crossed the desert and arrived in Sabha, Libya. He had gone from one disaster to another. \u201cThe country was unstable. Things worsened when fighting broke out between the militias and the Libyan National Army. If they captured you, they accused you of having joined one group or the other. I found myself in a similar situation to the one I had left.\u201d After some months, Muntaser boarded a dinghy bound for Sicily and then headed for the Alps. Now he is stuck in Belgium \u2013 unable to afford a clandestine route to London, where there is a big South Sudanese community that could help him find a job. When it gets really cold, he spends the night at a local family\u2019s home, arranged through a community initiative to find migrants a bed. His wife and two daughters are still in Darfur. \u201cWe\u2019d all like to live a better life in Europe,\u201d he says, \u201cbut when we got here, things are not as we had hoped. We live in fear, and all these things make our lives more stressful and unhappy.\u201d He has been suffering from flashbacks. \u201cI see the children who were killed in front of me in Darfur. In this state of despair, I have considered hurting myself.\u201d The therapy he attends at an MSF clinic has begun to help; today Muntaser works as a volunteer, helping new arrivals settle in Belgium. \u201cAt first it felt strange to go to a psychologist,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my mind, that is the doctor for crazy people.\u201d But he now encourages others to seek similar help. Overcoming this hurdle is part of the battle for the MSF therapists: \u201cThere is a big stigmatisation of psychologists,\u201d says Maksimovic. \u201cSometimes the clinic is the first time a migrant has heard of therapy.\u201d \u201cI feel bad for my friends who are not getting any help here in Belgium,\u201d says Muntaser. \u201cI want them to know that despite everything, there is still hope.\u201d \u2018The intelligence service arrested two fellow communists. They were after me next\u2019 Arghavan, 46, an Iranian mother and divorcee, has sought political asylum in Greece It was political conviction that brought Arghavan to Greece. The Iranian had never wanted to make the journey to \u201csuch a different world\u201d, but when the regime\u2019s crackdown on communists intensified she was left with little choice. \u201cI\u2019d already experienced prison \u2013 I knew what it was like to be tortured. I was very scared,\u201d she says, her eyes fixed on the floor of a room in the Athens office of MSF. \u201cIn Iran it\u2019s illegal to be a communist. They had arrested my leader and mentor. The intelligence service was after me next.\u201d For the 46-year-old, escape meant survival but also the beginning of \u201ca desire to move forward\u201d. Almost three years later, afflicted by health problems, unable to leave Athens and struggling to survive on a UN stipend of \u20ac150 a month, she feels more marooned than ever. The instincts that once prompted the political activist to board a train from Tehran to Tabriz, take a car to the border city of Bazargan and trek, with the aid of smugglers, into Turkey have been replaced by feelings of helplessness. Arghavan\u2019s days are spent walking her dog, visiting an MSF doctor for the diabetes she has developed and attending monthly counselling sessions. It is not a life she ever envisaged. \u201cI wanted to be what I am, an atheist and a feminist, and all of that I found in communism,\u201d says the former driving instructor, who has a hammer and sickle tattooed above her left wrist. \u201cToday I feel like a mouse in a trap.\u201d Like many, Arghavan never intended to stay in Greece. Her destination was the UK, and until her arrival on Samos, the eastern Aegean island opposite Turkey, that is where she thought she was heading. \u201cI had my son, Hamed, with me because he didn\u2019t want me to make the journey alone. We paid smugglers to get to England but they lied, again and again.\u201d Samos meant seven months of detainment in a desperately overcrowded camp. It was another two years before the asylum process began, a drill in mastering the art of patience. \u201cThe only thing I have learned is to be patient,\u201d she says, apologising as she begins to weep. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea when my application will be ready. So many months have passed.\u201d Fears of her asylum request being rejected have been compounded by the other thing that dominates her life: Yasmin, the 18-year-old daughter she was forced to leave behind. Meanwhile Hamed, 28, made his way to Germany as a stowaway on a truck over a year ago. Around 70,000 refugees are now in Greece, with the vast majority slated to remain in the country, given the closure of borders elsewhere. \u201cI want to move forward. If the regime were to change I\u2019d go back to Iran, but that\u2019s not an option. I suffer every day here, but I also have a dream \u2013 to go to Germany to be with my son.\u201d Interview by Helena Smith \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

To cash in, these technicians endure hours of exposure every day.</p> <p>At 4.30am, the sky is dark over Tucson. Leaving town on the highway, darkness stretches out between drivers and twinkling civilization. One pair of lights edges against the engulfing black of Pusch Ridge, a granite leviathan on the north side of town. The headlights belong to Taylor Law, a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technician, on his way to replace a condenser. He starts his days early \u2013 3am \u2013 in a race against soaring temperatures.</p> <p>Around 5am, Law arrives at the upscale planned community of Saddle Brooke, where he is greeted by white hairs in neon, walking their dogs.</p> <p>At 28, Law has spent most of his adult years outside. He\u2019s white, but his skin is nut brown. \u201cOnly the hands and the face, though,\u201d he says. \u201cMy wife loves the sunglasses tan.\u201d He wears a blue cotton T-shirt with sleeves to his wrists to protect him from the sun and sips from the jumbo Hydro Flask his wife got him. Other technicians keep icy coolers in the backs of their vans and drink Gatorade or Pedialyte to keep their electrolytes up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"735ed028ec7035bc2333a31c503537cfb7482241\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/735ed028ec7035bc2333a31c503537cfb7482241/0_0_3543_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"City of Tucson worker covering himself from the sun while working in Tucson,AZ on August 26th 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A city of Tucson worker covering himself from the sun while working outside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassidy Araiza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Law likes his job, and is good at it, but hopes to one day move into sales. When asked about his goals, he replies: \u201cI want to work less and make more money.\u201d On a later job, he takes a short break to admire a client\u2019s massive truck and daydream about a toy hauler. \u201cWorking in these better-off areas, I can see what is possible. The closer I am to money, the more likely it\u2019ll be that I get there,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He pulls into the driveway and turns off the van\u2019s frigid air conditioning before unloading heavy equipment next to the condenser he will replace \u2013 a five-hour operation he can trim down to three with good planning.</p> <p>At 6am, the temperature breaks 80F (26C). The birds and mosquitoes have joined Law in the side yard. He looks like the world\u2019s sweatiest orthodontist, working delicately with a thin nozzle of fire. Two pale elderly women pull their golf cart into the garage across the street. They cast a look in Law\u2019s direction like they\u2019re happy to be heading indoors, then close the curtains.</p> <p>\u201cMaintenance out here is crucial,\u201d Law says of his work. \u201cYou have extreme heat out here, which beats these units up. But, on top of the extreme heat, you have a lot of run time on these systems. Even keeping your thermostat at 80, your system is going to be running a lot during this time of year.\u201d</p> <p>Extra runtime means systems are apt to break down when Tucsonans rely on them most. Proactive measures help some Tucsonans avoid that uncomfortable position, but can cost hundreds of dollars a year. Instead, many Tucsonans nurse their systems along, replacing or repairing parts as necessary. Then, the resourceful go to parts stores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F32f7ea836fccd98e5ee3a228e9618e9ec850fc3f%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3543_2835&amp;left-caption=Aribal%20Benitezat%2C%20the%20owner%20of%20Miracle%20Breeze%2C%20poses%20for%20a%20portrait.&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fd895bb246d4a01f71df709c881dfb4cefb4c9149%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3543_2834&amp;right-caption=Inside%20the%20store%20at%20Miracle%20Breeze.%20Photographs%20by%20Cassidy%20Araiza%2FThe%20Guardian&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F32f7ea836fccd98e5ee3a228e9618e9ec850fc3f%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3543_2835&left-caption=Aribal%20Benitezat%2C%20the%20owner%20of%20Miracle%20Breeze%2C%20poses%20for%20a%20portrait.&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fd895bb246d4a01f71df709c881dfb4cefb4c9149%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3543_2834&right-caption=Inside%20the%20store%20at%20Miracle%20Breeze.%20Photographs%20by%20Cassidy%20Araiza%2FThe%20Guardian&always-place-captions-below=false\">.</a> </figure>  <p>Customers fill the parking lot at Arizona Maintenance, waiting for Aribal Benitez to open shop. Some have spent the night with broken evaporative coolers and could not sleep. The sooner they can get the parts they need, the more time they have to work against the rapidly increasing heat.</p> <p>His cash register features monuments to Tucsonans\u2019 endurance: pumps covered in mineral deposits like hoary stalagmites, cooler pads transformed into blocks of concrete, each caked with mineral debris that slowed the evaporative cooler until it stopped. The buildup is evidence that these homeowners endured years of discomfort before replacing a part that costs about $20. Benitez sees other homeowners go without cooling until June to keep electric bills down. \u201cTucson is a biweekly town,\u201d he explains. Since many wage workers get paid every other week, his store sees more business on payday.</p> <p>Many customers have lived in Tucson for all or most of their lives, as has a contractor named Scooby, who sources metal roofing supplies directly from Benitez\u2019s factory. Scooby is in a rush to get back out. \u201cWhen you work outside, every minute that goes by, it gets hotter,\u201d says Benitez.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"426250249ef6e691432a8747b10d6d282bc97a72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/426250249ef6e691432a8747b10d6d282bc97a72/0_0_3543_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View from Gates Pass in Tucson on August 26th, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from Gates Pass in Tucson on 26 August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassidy Araiza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 11am, what little shelter workers had outside is gone. \u201cYou wear a hat, make sure you cover your face,\u201d says Jesus Vasquez, a client who started working on roofs this summer.

In the middle of the day, shade is hard to come by. He has hidden underneath a vent for shelter. If he pushes himself too hard, he could fall off a roof. At the same time, if he turns down a job, there are thousands of other contractors in the city.</p> <p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t show up, someone else is gonna show up,\u201d says Benitez as he pulls on his gloves. From 1.30 to 4pm, the roof is around 120F (50C). \u201cFor this job, you have to be unconscious,\u201d says Benitez. \u201cIf you\u2019re conscious, you won\u2019t do this job.\u201d</p> <p>Though heat deaths most impact the elderly and those without homes, heat disproportionately impacts the quality of life in low-income areas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1528810af522fab78c0426dc20ac1ad7f9cd6317\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1528810af522fab78c0426dc20ac1ad7f9cd6317/0_0_3543_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heating &amp; Cooling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gregg Garfin: \u2018Someone born in the 1960s is probably turning on that AC earlier and keeping it on later than their parents did.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassidy Araiza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you lay an extreme heat map over a map of low income areas, it\u2019s the same map,\u201d says Regina Romero, the only major party candidate for mayor of Tucson. These areas suffer from the same urban heat island effect that causes the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/climate/heat-deaths-southwest.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">rising number of heat deaths</a> in Phoenix, where fewer trees and larger swaths of impermeable ground prime areas for heat absorption. In these neighborhoods especially, Tucsonans lean on public spaces like libraries as shelter from the heat.</p> <p>Gregg Garfin, an associate professor of climate, natural resources and policy at the University of Arizona, points out that heat islands cause night temperatures to rise even faster than daytime ones, and leave less time for Tucsonans\u2019 homes and bodies to recover. \u201cThis translates into increased energy use,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone born in the 1960s is probably turning on that AC earlier and keeping it on later than their parents did.\u201d</p> <p>Though heat islands affect specific areas, climate issues such as water conservation and electric transit options mobilize voters across Tucson. \u201cThe mayor and city council have been working hard to incentivize water conservation,\u201d says Romero. \u201cThis is nibbling around the edges of the problem.</p> <p>\u201cMy vision is to make sure that we have not just a livable community, but a thriving, climate-resilient community,\u201d Romero adds. \u201cThat we\u2019re investing in climate action; so that we are on our way to planting a million trees by 2030.\u201d Romero envisions a walkable Tucson with reliable, affordable, electric transit options \u201cso that people want to use our transit system\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F07a2b7bae90a90551da723f4f379fb7f372c8dcd%3Fcrop%3D0_0_2834_3543&amp;left-caption=Ice%20machine%20in%20Tucson.&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fb12cf15fb60561a998ae5699a17b237eb5e7861f%3Fcrop%3D0_0_2835_3543&amp;right-caption=A%20Tucson%20resident%20hydrates%20himself%20in%20the%20heat%20of%20the%20day.%20Photographs%20by%20Cassidy%20Araiza%2FThe%20Guardian&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"shadows\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F07a2b7bae90a90551da723f4f379fb7f372c8dcd%3Fcrop%3D0_0_2834_3543&left-caption=Ice%20machine%20in%20Tucson.&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fb12cf15fb60561a998ae5699a17b237eb5e7861f%3Fcrop%3D0_0_2835_3543&right-caption=A%20Tucson%20resident%20hydrates%20himself%20in%20the%20heat%20of%20the%20day.%20Photographs%20by%20Cassidy%20Araiza%2FThe%20Guardian&always-place-captions-below=false\">shadows</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cTucsonans need to believe that this investment is for their quality of life,\u201d she says.</p> <p>At noon in Tucson, the world is eerily still.

      "bodyText": "To live in Tucson is to be exposed. The Arizona city unfolds beneath four mountain ranges and a gaping sky, welcoming relentless sunlight. Anything here can be sun-bleached \u2013 billboards, garden hoses, family photos near windows, laundry left out to dry. Most of the year it\u2019s a dry heat, and sweat evaporates off skin faster than it\u2019s produced. Summertime is different. In monsoon season, heat and humidity steadily increase until a storm breaks. There is no other release. Heat cannot exit from the body, creating a claustrophobic feeling inside the skin. Sweat becomes a vital sign \u2013 its absence indicates heatstroke. Not all Tucsonans stand equal in the face of heat. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have an office job and a robust air conditioning system, your discomfort will be limited to the walk through a parking lot. But as summers get more intense, people who work outdoors, those on a low income and the elderly face imminent peril. John Soland, a salesman at a cooler parts store, sees people come in for parts and for shelter. \u201cWe had a guy that passed away under a tree in front of Walgreens from the heat just a couple weeks ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw him every day. I\u2019d hand him cups of water. He just laid down and passed away.\u201d The independent climate research organization recently labeled Tucson the \u201charbinger\u201d of dangerous increases in heat and humidity; since 1970 the city has seen the second largest increase of days that feel over 100F (37C). By 2050, Tucson is projected to feel like 105F (40C) or higher for more than a third of the year. While many Tucsonans have adapted to increasingly hot summers, the materials of our homes and comfort have not. Air conditioning units, evaporative coolers and roofs are breaking down faster than ever before. Even so, the city is growing as people get priced out of California. For the thousands of registered contractors in Tucson, business is booming. To cash in, these technicians endure hours of exposure every day. At 4.30am, the sky is dark over Tucson. Leaving town on the highway, darkness stretches out between drivers and twinkling civilization. One pair of lights edges against the engulfing black of Pusch Ridge, a granite leviathan on the north side of town. The headlights belong to Taylor Law, a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technician, on his way to replace a condenser. He starts his days early \u2013 3am \u2013 in a race against soaring temperatures. Around 5am, Law arrives at the upscale planned community of Saddle Brooke, where he is greeted by white hairs in neon, walking their dogs. At 28, Law has spent most of his adult years outside. He\u2019s white, but his skin is nut brown. \u201cOnly the hands and the face, though,\u201d he says. \u201cMy wife loves the sunglasses tan.\u201d He wears a blue cotton T-shirt with sleeves to his wrists to protect him from the sun and sips from the jumbo Hydro Flask his wife got him. Other technicians keep icy coolers in the backs of their vans and drink Gatorade or Pedialyte to keep their electrolytes up. Law likes his job, and is good at it, but hopes to one day move into sales. When asked about his goals, he replies: \u201cI want to work less and make more money.\u201d On a later job, he takes a short break to admire a client\u2019s massive truck and daydream about a toy hauler. \u201cWorking in these better-off areas, I can see what is possible. The closer I am to money, the more likely it\u2019ll be that I get there,\u201d he says. He pulls into the driveway and turns off the van\u2019s frigid air conditioning before unloading heavy equipment next to the condenser he will replace \u2013 a five-hour operation he can trim down to three with good planning. At 6am, the temperature breaks 80F (26C). The birds and mosquitoes have joined Law in the side yard. He looks like the world\u2019s sweatiest orthodontist, working delicately with a thin nozzle of fire. Two pale elderly women pull their golf cart into the garage across the street. They cast a look in Law\u2019s direction like they\u2019re happy to be heading indoors, then close the curtains. \u201cMaintenance out here is crucial,\u201d Law says of his work. \u201cYou have extreme heat out here, which beats these units up. But, on top of the extreme heat, you have a lot of run time on these systems. Even keeping your thermostat at 80, your system is going to be running a lot during this time of year.\u201d Extra runtime means systems are apt to break down when Tucsonans rely on them most. Proactive measures help some Tucsonans avoid that uncomfortable position, but can cost hundreds of dollars a year. Instead, many Tucsonans nurse their systems along, replacing or repairing parts as necessary. Then, the resourceful go to parts stores. Customers fill the parking lot at Arizona Maintenance, waiting for Aribal Benitez to open shop. Some have spent the night with broken evaporative coolers and could not sleep. The sooner they can get the parts they need, the more time they have to work against the rapidly increasing heat. His cash register features monuments to Tucsonans\u2019 endurance: pumps covered in mineral deposits like hoary stalagmites, cooler pads transformed into blocks of concrete, each caked with mineral debris that slowed the evaporative cooler until it stopped. The buildup is evidence that these homeowners endured years of discomfort before replacing a part that costs about $20. Benitez sees other homeowners go without cooling until June to keep electric bills down. \u201cTucson is a biweekly town,\u201d he explains. Since many wage workers get paid every other week, his store sees more business on payday. Many customers have lived in Tucson for all or most of their lives, as has a contractor named Scooby, who sources metal roofing supplies directly from Benitez\u2019s factory. Scooby is in a rush to get back out. \u201cWhen you work outside, every minute that goes by, it gets hotter,\u201d says Benitez. By 11am, what little shelter workers had outside is gone. \u201cYou wear a hat, make sure you cover your face,\u201d says Jesus Vasquez, a client who started working on roofs this summer. If he didn\u2019t wear a cowl over his neck up to his sunglasses, the sun reflecting off the roof would burn his face until it peeled. \u201cWe usually tend to wear steel-toed boots. With regular shoes, the bottom starts legitimately melting.\u201d He reveals the bottom of his sneaker. The yellow rubber melted through, forming a ridge where his sole poked out. \u201cBut this job is good. There are ups and downs. Cloudy days are the ups,\u201d he says. In the middle of the day, shade is hard to come by. He has hidden underneath a vent for shelter. If he pushes himself too hard, he could fall off a roof. At the same time, if he turns down a job, there are thousands of other contractors in the city. \u201cIf they don\u2019t show up, someone else is gonna show up,\u201d says Benitez as he pulls on his gloves. From 1.30 to 4pm, the roof is around 120F (50C). \u201cFor this job, you have to be unconscious,\u201d says Benitez. \u201cIf you\u2019re conscious, you won\u2019t do this job.\u201d Though heat deaths most impact the elderly and those without homes, heat disproportionately impacts the quality of life in low-income areas. \u201cIf you lay an extreme heat map over a map of low income areas, it\u2019s the same map,\u201d says Regina Romero, the only major party candidate for mayor of Tucson. These areas suffer from the same urban heat island effect that causes the rising number of heat deaths in Phoenix, where fewer trees and larger swaths of impermeable ground prime areas for heat absorption. In these neighborhoods especially, Tucsonans lean on public spaces like libraries as shelter from the heat. Gregg Garfin, an associate professor of climate, natural resources and policy at the University of Arizona, points out that heat islands cause night temperatures to rise even faster than daytime ones, and leave less time for Tucsonans\u2019 homes and bodies to recover. \u201cThis translates into increased energy use,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone born in the 1960s is probably turning on that AC earlier and keeping it on later than their parents did.\u201d Though heat islands affect specific areas, climate issues such as water conservation and electric transit options mobilize voters across Tucson. \u201cThe mayor and city council have been working hard to incentivize water conservation,\u201d says Romero. \u201cThis is nibbling around the edges of the problem. \u201cMy vision is to make sure that we have not just a livable community, but a thriving, climate-resilient community,\u201d Romero adds. \u201cThat we\u2019re investing in climate action; so that we are on our way to planting a million trees by 2030.\u201d Romero envisions a walkable Tucson with reliable, affordable, electric transit options \u201cso that people want to use our transit system\u201d. \u201cTucsonans need to believe that this investment is for their quality of life,\u201d she says. At noon in Tucson, the world is eerily still. No people walk on the streets. No cars drive on the road. The chirping birds have returned to nest. The flurries of rabbits have curled up in their warrens. The only movement comes from the hawk circling above, and the slow drift of clouds. The circulatory system is frantically bailing heat from the body. If Law pauses from his work, he might notice the heartbeat surging under every inch of his skin. Instead, he pushes silently through. \u201cI\u2019m the type of person to just grunt through pain. I don\u2019t know how to slow down,\u201d he says. This attitude has caused him advanced back problems that his insurance won\u2019t cover. \u201cIt got to the point where I couldn\u2019t tie my shoes.\u201d At 3pm, he climbs down the ladder for the last time. He collapses the ladder and heaves it over his shoulder, up onto the roof of his van, and drives away. When the sun goes down, the city can finally relax. Temperatures start to cool in mid-August, when the monsoon breaks and rain pours down. The night after a rain is almost comfortable. Law drives to a date with his pregnant wife, one of the last before their son arrives. The windy roads are unlit and everything is quiet. His car windows are open; the air conditioner is off.",

In one sense the Premier League is a snazzy world away from Gaelic football, which remains an amateur pursuit despite its huge popularity (Egan Sr combined his sporting triumphs with a day job as a policeman). But the centre-back says one of the reasons he enjoys playing for the Blades is that United have retained a rooting in local identity that makes it akin to Gaelic clubs. Before that, though, he explains how his dad convinced him to aim for success in English football rather than at home.</p> <p>Until the age of 16 he split his time evenly between football, Gaelic football and hurling. Then, with English clubs wooing him, he had to choose. Dad offered advice. \u201cI remember having a few conversations with him saying: \u2018I want to follow in your footsteps, I want to play GAA.\u2019 And he basically said: \u2018Look, whatever you want to do, do, but if I was you I\u2019d give football a go because I think you\u2019re good and I think you\u2019d do well.\u2019 That played on my mind. When I went on a trial to Sunderland and they offered me a contract, I had to make a decision. So I parked the GAA and just decided I was going to go ahead and play football.\u201d</p> <p>Was any part of picking football about avoiding constant comparisons with his father? \u201cNo, I think [Gaelic football] probably would have been an easier route. It would have been hard to get to his level but I do think that if you\u2019re good and your father has done what my father did, you probably get more of a chance than other people. I think the route I took is probably harder.\u201d</p> <p>It got even harder when, just as he seemed on the verge of breaking into Sunderland\u2019s first team at the age of 19, he was told his father had died unexpectedly after returning home following heart surgery. \u201cMartin O\u2019Neill was the manager at Sunderland at the time and I got the call to go and travel with the first team to Everton. Then I got the call the next morning that my father had passed away. I was on the first flight home. People on that flight going back to Cork knew who my dad was and knew who I was. I was just head down, hood up \u2013 devastated. It hit me hard.\u201d</p> <p>After two weeks of \u201cmoping around\u201d he asked his family whether they would mind if he returned to Sunderland \u201cto just train and try to get back a normal routine\u201d. Over the next three years he never made a first-team appearance for Sunderland but enjoyed loan spells at four clubs before joining Gillingham full-time in 2014. That was where his career took off, his performances earning a place in the League One team of the year and a transfer to Brentford, where he had two good years before signing for Sheffield United and winning promotion to the Premier League.</p> <p>At Bramall Lane he has become the linchpin of Chris Wilder\u2019s avant-garde defence. He is the middle part of a three-man backline in which the other two players, usually Chris Basham and Jack O\u2019Connell, are encouraged to fly down the wings. This season United have introduced \u201coverlapping centre-backs\u201d to Premier League jargon and it is going to be fascinating to see how opponents cope.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mad,\u201d he says. \u201cI played against Sheffield United for Brentford and I remember the first time wasn\u2019t too bad but then they came down to Griffin Park I was thinking: \u2018What\u2019s going on here? Where are they coming from?\u2019 I just thought it was chaos, to be honest. Then when I signed, you do the coaching and you see where it comes from. It does take a couple of weeks to get into a rhythm and find out where to be and get used to people bombing on and other people ducking around. But it\u2019s definitely organised and we have good shape about us. We kept 21 clean sheets in the league last season.\u201d</p> <p>Blades fans will travel in numbers to Stamford Bridge. Then Egan will head to Croke Park to cheer on Kerry, who hope to stop Dublin becoming the first team to win the All-Ireland for five years in a row. Kerry nearly did it in 1982 but lost to a last-minute goal. Egan Sr was Kerry\u2019s captain that day. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like it much when you brought that up,\u201d says Egan with a soft chuckle. \u201cIf you wanted to annoy him you could bring it up. It\u2019s amazing \u2013 you can win six All-Irelands and the one you think about most is the one that got away. Funny how sport works.\u201d</p>",

I think the route I took is probably harder.\u201d It got even harder when, just as he seemed on the verge of breaking into Sunderland\u2019s first team at the age of 19, he was told his father had died unexpectedly after returning home following heart surgery. \u201cMartin O\u2019Neill was the manager at Sunderland at the time and I got the call to go and travel with the first team to Everton. Then I got the call the next morning that my father had passed away. I was on the first flight home. People on that flight going back to Cork knew who my dad was and knew who I was. I was just head down, hood up \u2013 devastated. It hit me hard.\u201d After two weeks of \u201cmoping around\u201d he asked his family whether they would mind if he returned to Sunderland \u201cto just train and try to get back a normal routine\u201d. Over the next three years he never made a first-team appearance for Sunderland but enjoyed loan spells at four clubs before joining Gillingham full-time in 2014. That was where his career took off, his performances earning a place in the League One team of the year and a transfer to Brentford, where he had two good years before signing for Sheffield United and winning promotion to the Premier League. At Bramall Lane he has become the linchpin of Chris Wilder\u2019s avant-garde defence. He is the middle part of a three-man backline in which the other two players, usually Chris Basham and Jack O\u2019Connell, are encouraged to fly down the wings. This season United have introduced \u201coverlapping centre-backs\u201d to Premier League jargon and it is going to be fascinating to see how opponents cope. \u201cIt\u2019s mad,\u201d he says. \u201cI played against Sheffield United for Brentford and I remember the first time wasn\u2019t too bad but then they came down to Griffin Park I was thinking: \u2018What\u2019s going on here? Where are they coming from?\u2019 I just thought it was chaos, to be honest. Then when I signed, you do the coaching and you see where it comes from. It does take a couple of weeks to get into a rhythm and find out where to be and get used to people bombing on and other people ducking around. But it\u2019s definitely organised and we have good shape about us. We kept 21 clean sheets in the league last season.\u201d Blades fans will travel in numbers to Stamford Bridge. Then Egan will head to Croke Park to cheer on Kerry, who hope to stop Dublin becoming the first team to win the All-Ireland for five years in a row. Kerry nearly did it in 1982 but lost to a last-minute goal. Egan Sr was Kerry\u2019s captain that day. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like it much when you brought that up,\u201d says Egan with a soft chuckle. \u201cIf you wanted to annoy him you could bring it up. It\u2019s amazing \u2013 you can win six All-Irelands and the one you think about most is the one that got away. Funny how sport works.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Those angered by what feels like nigh-constant nitpicking at the <a href=\"https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/duke-and-duchess-sussex\" title=\"\">Duke and Duchess of Sussex</a> are not imagining it. The noise is endless. I\u2019ll call their Royal Highnesses \u201cHarry and Meghan\u201d from this stage on because, let\u2019s be frank, this is the sort of breezy informality you invite when you reach out to fans daily via Instagram inspirational messages, plug an ethical clothing label, allow Jameela Jamil to fight your battles on Twitter, broadcast your daddy issues via open letters, share your mental health history on podcasts, milk the press for their attention, then loathe the press for their attention, and cadge free holidays from wealthier, internationally famous people.</p> <p>None of this, I must stress is wrong \u2013 and in celebrity land, it\u2019s completely humdrum. Particularly the free holiday part. Very rich celebs can rarely finance the calibre of holiday they feel befits them. Summers are for leaning heavily on benevolent, social-climbing billionaires who proffer mansions in Cap d\u2019Antibes, yachts to pooter around the Aegean in, and helicopters to get seamlessly to Cape Cod.</p> <p>Meghan and Harry are really brilliant celebrities, just like Cara and Ashley and Kanye and Kim. But that\u2019s tricky if we are also supposed to respect and behold them as monarchy; the backbone of the entire British constitution. Better than us. More precious than us. As God, himself, intended. Because, frankly, that always did require a pretty willing suspense of disbelief \u2013 and now here are Harry and Meghan. They want to be royals, but also live lightly. No one properly laid it out to Meghan Markle that being in the monarchy is not supposed to be fun. Being royal is supposed to look physically painful. It is the visible scream behind Prince Charles\u2019s eyes as he watches another regional school glee club sing a cappella. We need our monarchy outwardly frumpy and by and large opinionless, except for the occasional furious letter to an architect or town planner. We need them with covered shoulders and no knees showing. Buzzwords for Meghan\u2019s mood board might be: silent, stoic, dutiful. Yes, Diana and Fergie tried to move this narrative forward and, wow, how that worked out for them. Princess Margaret partied hard and wore her royalty starrily, but she was then, and remains, a laughing stock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/24/is-simon-cowell-new-face-vision-of-deepfake-future\">Is Simon Cowell's surprising new face a vision of our deepfake future?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Royal is not being constantly visible in order to keep your follower count buoyant; it is being lost for some weeks at Sandringham, then catapulted into six courses plus coffee with the latest visiting deaf dictator, while wearing jewels that hurt, before an early start to shake hands at a hospice. Royal isn\u2019t about having fun at The Lion King with your friend Beyonc\u00e9. It is about seeing no dichotomy between saving elephants and shooting elephants and finding the Glorious Twelfth truly glorious.</p> <p>No one makes being royal look like less fun than the Duchess of Cambridge, who has had a very free pass lately \u2013 possibly because the most riveting thing she\u2019s done in 12 months is be allowed to plant some astrantias at the Chelsea flower show. None of us has a clue what the Duchess of Cambridge is thinking: about the polar caps, wimmin\u2019s issues, about flying bloody FlyBe to Balmoral to spend August being feasted on by ravenous midges and watch angry Grandpa Phil driving the Range Rover.</p> <p>Can we imagine the Duchess of Cambridge writing an accidentally open letter to her Uncle Gary about last year\u2019s domestic abuse charge? Or a cryptic Instagram post (subtext: there are snakes everywhere, hun), like Meghan with her positive-affirmation cupcakes? And who is in the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s girl gang? No one knows. Softly, softly and ever so silently, Kate Middleton is channelling herself into a Queen Mary of Teck figure: the less we know, the less there is to disrespect or question. Presently, she\u2019s the biggest hope for survival the House of Windsor has.</p> <p>Many have said that the pelting Harry and Meghan receive is racist and misogynist. This uppity woman had the temerity to want a place at the table and now, at all costs, must be stopped. And from many individuals, it possibly is; but for most, the truth is more nuanced. Numerous times, I find myself roaring at the television, \u201cFor the love of God, if you want everyone to stop talking, then stop giving everyone things to talk about.\u201d</p> <p>Harry and Meghan need to learn the art of being boring, beginning with 12 months staying home, with no need to decorate or renovate. No clothes designing (you\u2019re not Michelle Keegan for Next) and no magazine editing, because every columnist you select will be deemed a reflection on your inner monologue. Less public pontificating; more afternoons spent flower arranging. If generous Uncle Elton wants to see you, let him make the journey to you. Please stop using Diana as a sticking plaster over your eco-warrior hypocrisy. No more boogie nights out with Amal and Serena; yes, please, to being seen trudging around country shows judging exemplary marrows. Fade into glorious obscurity for a while. Come back gently in a year or two, smiling beatifically at your public.</p> <p>We need to miss you, and re-remember you\u2019re an asset. The monarchy can\u2019t rip up the rulebook: they are the rulebook.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Those angered by what feels like nigh-constant nitpicking at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are not imagining it. The noise is endless. I\u2019ll call their Royal Highnesses \u201cHarry and Meghan\u201d from this stage on because, let\u2019s be frank, this is the sort of breezy informality you invite when you reach out to fans daily via Instagram inspirational messages, plug an ethical clothing label, allow Jameela Jamil to fight your battles on Twitter, broadcast your daddy issues via open letters, share your mental health history on podcasts, milk the press for their attention, then loathe the press for their attention, and cadge free holidays from wealthier, internationally famous people. None of this, I must stress is wrong \u2013 and in celebrity land, it\u2019s completely humdrum. Particularly the free holiday part. Very rich celebs can rarely finance the calibre of holiday they feel befits them. Summers are for leaning heavily on benevolent, social-climbing billionaires who proffer mansions in Cap d\u2019Antibes, yachts to pooter around the Aegean in, and helicopters to get seamlessly to Cape Cod. Meghan and Harry are really brilliant celebrities, just like Cara and Ashley and Kanye and Kim. But that\u2019s tricky if we are also supposed to respect and behold them as monarchy; the backbone of the entire British constitution. Better than us. More precious than us. As God, himself, intended. Because, frankly, that always did require a pretty willing suspense of disbelief \u2013 and now here are Harry and Meghan. They want to be royals, but also live lightly. No one properly laid it out to Meghan Markle that being in the monarchy is not supposed to be fun. Being royal is supposed to look physically painful. It is the visible scream behind Prince Charles\u2019s eyes as he watches another regional school glee club sing a cappella. We need our monarchy outwardly frumpy and by and large opinionless, except for the occasional furious letter to an architect or town planner. We need them with covered shoulders and no knees showing. Buzzwords for Meghan\u2019s mood board might be: silent, stoic, dutiful. Yes, Diana and Fergie tried to move this narrative forward and, wow, how that worked out for them. Princess Margaret partied hard and wore her royalty starrily, but she was then, and remains, a laughing stock. Royal is not being constantly visible in order to keep your follower count buoyant; it is being lost for some weeks at Sandringham, then catapulted into six courses plus coffee with the latest visiting deaf dictator, while wearing jewels that hurt, before an early start to shake hands at a hospice. Royal isn\u2019t about having fun at The Lion King with your friend Beyonc\u00e9. It is about seeing no dichotomy between saving elephants and shooting elephants and finding the Glorious Twelfth truly glorious. No one makes being royal look like less fun than the Duchess of Cambridge, who has had a very free pass lately \u2013 possibly because the most riveting thing she\u2019s done in 12 months is be allowed to plant some astrantias at the Chelsea flower show. None of us has a clue what the Duchess of Cambridge is thinking: about the polar caps, wimmin\u2019s issues, about flying bloody FlyBe to Balmoral to spend August being feasted on by ravenous midges and watch angry Grandpa Phil driving the Range Rover. Can we imagine the Duchess of Cambridge writing an accidentally open letter to her Uncle Gary about last year\u2019s domestic abuse charge? Or a cryptic Instagram post (subtext: there are snakes everywhere, hun), like Meghan with her positive-affirmation cupcakes? And who is in the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s girl gang? No one knows. Softly, softly and ever so silently, Kate Middleton is channelling herself into a Queen Mary of Teck figure: the less we know, the less there is to disrespect or question. Presently, she\u2019s the biggest hope for survival the House of Windsor has. Many have said that the pelting Harry and Meghan receive is racist and misogynist. This uppity woman had the temerity to want a place at the table and now, at all costs, must be stopped. And from many individuals, it possibly is; but for most, the truth is more nuanced. Numerous times, I find myself roaring at the television, \u201cFor the love of God, if you want everyone to stop talking, then stop giving everyone things to talk about.\u201d Harry and Meghan need to learn the art of being boring, beginning with 12 months staying home, with no need to decorate or renovate. No clothes designing (you\u2019re not Michelle Keegan for Next) and no magazine editing, because every columnist you select will be deemed a reflection on your inner monologue. Less public pontificating; more afternoons spent flower arranging. If generous Uncle Elton wants to see you, let him make the journey to you. Please stop using Diana as a sticking plaster over your eco-warrior hypocrisy. No more boogie nights out with Amal and Serena; yes, please, to being seen trudging around country shows judging exemplary marrows. Fade into glorious obscurity for a while. Come back gently in a year or two, smiling beatifically at your public. We need to miss you, and re-remember you\u2019re an asset. The monarchy can\u2019t rip up the rulebook: they are the rulebook.",

      "body": "<p>Since I can remember, my parents have wanted me to work in a restaurant. \u201cYou need to build character,\u201d they would tell me, usually when we were eating out, and always unprompted. \u201cWe raised you too soft.\u201d</p> <p>My mother had worked in a Chinese restaurant when she first moved to the US and felt that her experience had toughened her up. When she remembered how wimpy she used to be, her blood pressure would rise. \u201cI made your dad fly from Colorado to Los Angeles to pick me up from the airport. We were dead broke for months, because I couldn\u2019t handle a simple connecting flight.\u201d This was, by the way, not only the flight that had delivered her from Beijing to the US, but also the first flight she\u2019d been on.</p> <p>So the summer after college, I got a job waiting tables at a Peking duck restaurant outside Washington DC. The place was incredibly popular, though less with Chinese people than with their suburban neighbours. It specialised in Peking duck \u2013 which was carved tableside and then wrapped by the waiting staff \u2013 but also served a mix of northern Chinese and Americanised Chinese food. When asked if I could start the next morning, I said yes without hesitation. I wanted to be tough like my mother, a woman who had started her own business in her 40s, and who regularly scolded her own clients until they apologised to her. The manager gave me a blazer to wear and told me to buy a clip-on bow tie and nonslip shoes.</p> <p>I soon realised that my desire to be tough was fuelled largely by the delusion that I already was. While I was still in training, I overloaded my tray with drinks, ignoring the bartender\u2019s warnings. I managed to wobble the tray over to the table and hand over two drinks like a pro. Then I promptly dropped the third drink down a customer\u2019s back. He leapt up as though a scorpion had crawled under his shirt. My trainer apologised for me and sent me away to another table.</p> <p>Everyone at the restaurant had years of experience. I was the youngest employee by at least three decades and, though my co-workers tried their best to guide me, as the \u201clittle sister\u201d of the group, I was always putting myself, and my tables, in harm\u2019s way. I often burned my fingers on hot plates and hot-and-sour soup, and dropped boxes on myself in the walk-in fridge. One night, overwhelmed by the dinner rush, I placed a boiling hot order of duck-bone soup on a table, not realising that the tureen dish was inches from a child\u2019s face. Another waitress snatched the soup away. I apologised to the family, but, in that moment, I wasn\u2019t sorry at all. That child and her mother had been a nightmare, sending back dishes for no reason other than the child\u2019s pickiness. Such a person might benefit from a little light scalding. Clearly, I was both physically and mentally unprepared for this high-pressure environment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I often burned my fingers on hot plates and hot-and-sour soup, and dropped boxes on myself in the walk-in fridge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After 12-hour shifts I would drive back to my parents\u2019 house, where I was staying for the summer. I would come in through the garage door, as stained and crumpled as the tips in my pocket, and my mother would be waiting in her pyjamas. While I counted my tips in bed, she would force me to talk about my day. For the first few minutes, I would feel too tired to string a sentence together but, invariably, once I remembered a slight from a customer or a nasty comment from the manager, I had energy to burn. And to my surprise, my mother had her own stories to add to the pile; stories I had not heard before that gave me an idea of what she was like at my age.</p> <p>When I talked about customers who\u2019d leave barely a 10% tip after a three-hour dinner, my mother remembered a regular who was so stingy that she would compete with another waitress to see if they could get him to leave a single cent. How they wooed and pampered him, until one day, <em>voil\u00e0</em>, he slipped my mother an entire quarter.</p> <p>When the head cook yelled at me for messing up an order, my mother told me that the cooks at her restaurant groped her every chance they got. \u201cAnd if you didn\u2019t let them \u2018eat your tofu\u2019, good luck getting your dishes on time!\u201d she scoffed.</p> <p>I enjoyed our nightly chats, but I didn\u2019t exactly look forward to them. I was exhausted and demoralised. I\u2019d expected a certain level of mistreatment \u2013 I knew how terribly people could act towards waiting staff \u2013 but I had not expected them to look right through me and my co-workers, even when they were talking directly to us.</p> <p>One day, during the lunch shift a few weeks into my waitressing stint, I waited on a table for two from hell. They both ordered kung pao chicken, a spicy chicken stir-fry coated in chilli sauce, but they asked for the sauce on the side. After checking with them twice, I fulfilled their strange request and brought them two plates of naked chicken.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d one asked. They insisted that they had asked for <em>extra</em> sauce on the side. Then they asked for a small plate, but the plate I brought them didn\u2019t have tall enough sides. When I brought them a bowl instead, they asked me if I was stupid. By the time I gave them their bill, they\u2019d clocked my name from my tag and started using it as a synonym for screwing up. As in: \u201cThere she goes, another Lillian.\u201d The entire time, they talked about me to one another as if I couldn\u2019t hear, or understand.</p> <p>But I won\u2019t pretend that I experienced the same treatment as my co-workers. I was the only server born in America, with English as my first language, while my co-workers spoke English as a second, third, sometimes fourth language. After I\u2019d spoken a few times to the people I was serving, some of them would start to warm up and actually look me in the eye.<strong> </strong>This confirmed what I was beginning to realise: that having a Chinese face in a Chinese restaurant added an extra level of alienation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57acd22bfe0c3ade139e8f1a37cf7b7954c61ae0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57acd22bfe0c3ade139e8f1a37cf7b7954c61ae0/207_579_3533_4415/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lillian Li\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This was not a for ever job.

This was not a for ever job: I would be leaving at the end of the summer, when I moved to Michigan for graduate school. I could do anything for one summer, even if it meant never seeing my family or friends, even if the job exhausted me so much that I slept through my one day off a week. Surely, I would improve.</p> <p>But even as I got incrementally better, the job wasn\u2019t getting easier. I still couldn\u2019t balance a tray with more than four dishes. I still didn\u2019t know enough Chinese or Spanish to talk to anyone I worked with. I still wrote my orders in English, which only one cook could understand. And I was no tougher than I\u2019d been on day one. One dinner shift, I was so overwhelmed that I told a table of four to hang out for as long as they liked after they\u2019d paid their bill.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I realised that nothing was stopping me from quitting. But what I would tell my mother?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d they asked; they\u2019d already been hogging the table for two hours.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll make my shift easier,\u201d I said, even as I saw my manager giving them the evil eye.</p> <p>Finally, I hit breaking point. Not a huge accident or a blowout fight with my boss, but quite the opposite: I received a slight promotion. I had finally proven that I was a reliable enough waiter to participate in the daily section lottery. Before that, I was assigned the same section every lunch and dinner: a group of booths and tables that I could barely handle on a good day. But now I would have to draw a number with the other waiters during the afternoon meeting. I was eligible to serve the private party rooms that seated 40, and the banquet tables, too.</p> <p>\u201cImagine the tips!\u201d my co-workers told me.</p> <p>I imagined spilling beer down the backs of 40 people. Even barring an accident, I would have to, at the very least, wrap duck pancakes for every person sitting at the banquet table or in the private party room. A veteran waiter could wrap a pancake in 10 seconds. I sometimes took well over a minute. I didn\u2019t have to imagine myself moving slowly around a giant table as everyone watched and waited; I\u2019d lived a miniature version of that nightmare every night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89c0b1751fd6bb1f06e7eb0995475f608094917b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89c0b1751fd6bb1f06e7eb0995475f608094917b/0_417_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lillian Li\u2019s mother (left), with fellow waitress Ah Ping in 1990\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lillian Li\u2019s mother (left), with fellow waitress Ah Ping in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Lillian Li</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the first time, I wondered why was I still working at this restaurant. Why had I said yes to mandatory double shifts and no breaks on Saturdays and Sundays? Why hadn\u2019t I got a job at a different restaurant, with more tolerable working conditions? Or a job tutoring high school kids? I didn\u2019t need the money, and I didn\u2019t need the work experience. With a shattering burst of clarity, I realised that nothing was stopping me from quitting. I decided gleefully that this night would be my final one.</p> <p>Except, there was something. Driving home from work that night, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what I would tell my mother. My mother, who had put up with evil cooks and bad customers and backstabbing co-workers. Who had quit only because she\u2019d become pregnant with me. Our weeks of commiserating had been one of the first times I\u2019d felt that we were talking as equals. Now, I would return to being her soft, spoiled daughter. That night, after hours of hand-wringing, I went to her. I told her I was sorry, but that I didn\u2019t think I could work as a waitress any longer. I asked her if it was OK to quit.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d was her bewildered reply.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I need to know that you won\u2019t think less of me,\u201d I said, and started to cry.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I think that?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe only people who do this work are the ones who have to. You don\u2019t have to, so of course you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>Why else had she come up to my room every night to ask me about my day? Because she was my mother, yes, and her heart ached to think of me shaking under the weight of my big tray. But also because she knew that the only way you could feel like a human being in that job was if you had someone to talk to.</p> <p>At the end of the summer, my parents came with me to Michigan to help me move in. In return, I accompanied them to lunch with a woman I\u2019d never met, a woman who had once worked at the same restaurant as my mother. My mother called her Ah-Ping. She had reconnected with her through social media, around the same time I\u2019d started working at the restaurant. As we drove to her house in Ann Arbor, I didn\u2019t understand why we were going out of our way to see this person.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1eee94c32bdbbbd59e58fc999c9ec5ea3d89154\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1eee94c32bdbbbd59e58fc999c9ec5ea3d89154/774_0_3900_3900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lillian Li\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My image of my young mother started to shift.

      "bodyText": "Since I can remember, my parents have wanted me to work in a restaurant. \u201cYou need to build character,\u201d they would tell me, usually when we were eating out, and always unprompted. \u201cWe raised you too soft.\u201d My mother had worked in a Chinese restaurant when she first moved to the US and felt that her experience had toughened her up. When she remembered how wimpy she used to be, her blood pressure would rise. \u201cI made your dad fly from Colorado to Los Angeles to pick me up from the airport. We were dead broke for months, because I couldn\u2019t handle a simple connecting flight.\u201d This was, by the way, not only the flight that had delivered her from Beijing to the US, but also the first flight she\u2019d been on. So the summer after college, I got a job waiting tables at a Peking duck restaurant outside Washington DC. The place was incredibly popular, though less with Chinese people than with their suburban neighbours. It specialised in Peking duck \u2013 which was carved tableside and then wrapped by the waiting staff \u2013 but also served a mix of northern Chinese and Americanised Chinese food. When asked if I could start the next morning, I said yes without hesitation. I wanted to be tough like my mother, a woman who had started her own business in her 40s, and who regularly scolded her own clients until they apologised to her. The manager gave me a blazer to wear and told me to buy a clip-on bow tie and nonslip shoes. I soon realised that my desire to be tough was fuelled largely by the delusion that I already was. While I was still in training, I overloaded my tray with drinks, ignoring the bartender\u2019s warnings. I managed to wobble the tray over to the table and hand over two drinks like a pro. Then I promptly dropped the third drink down a customer\u2019s back. He leapt up as though a scorpion had crawled under his shirt. My trainer apologised for me and sent me away to another table. Everyone at the restaurant had years of experience. I was the youngest employee by at least three decades and, though my co-workers tried their best to guide me, as the \u201clittle sister\u201d of the group, I was always putting myself, and my tables, in harm\u2019s way. I often burned my fingers on hot plates and hot-and-sour soup, and dropped boxes on myself in the walk-in fridge. One night, overwhelmed by the dinner rush, I placed a boiling hot order of duck-bone soup on a table, not realising that the tureen dish was inches from a child\u2019s face. Another waitress snatched the soup away. I apologised to the family, but, in that moment, I wasn\u2019t sorry at all. That child and her mother had been a nightmare, sending back dishes for no reason other than the child\u2019s pickiness. Such a person might benefit from a little light scalding. Clearly, I was both physically and mentally unprepared for this high-pressure environment. After 12-hour shifts I would drive back to my parents\u2019 house, where I was staying for the summer. I would come in through the garage door, as stained and crumpled as the tips in my pocket, and my mother would be waiting in her pyjamas. While I counted my tips in bed, she would force me to talk about my day. For the first few minutes, I would feel too tired to string a sentence together but, invariably, once I remembered a slight from a customer or a nasty comment from the manager, I had energy to burn. And to my surprise, my mother had her own stories to add to the pile; stories I had not heard before that gave me an idea of what she was like at my age. When I talked about customers who\u2019d leave barely a 10% tip after a three-hour dinner, my mother remembered a regular who was so stingy that she would compete with another waitress to see if they could get him to leave a single cent. How they wooed and pampered him, until one day, voil\u00e0, he slipped my mother an entire quarter. When the head cook yelled at me for messing up an order, my mother told me that the cooks at her restaurant groped her every chance they got. \u201cAnd if you didn\u2019t let them \u2018eat your tofu\u2019, good luck getting your dishes on time!\u201d she scoffed. I enjoyed our nightly chats, but I didn\u2019t exactly look forward to them. I was exhausted and demoralised. I\u2019d expected a certain level of mistreatment \u2013 I knew how terribly people could act towards waiting staff \u2013 but I had not expected them to look right through me and my co-workers, even when they were talking directly to us. One day, during the lunch shift a few weeks into my waitressing stint, I waited on a table for two from hell. They both ordered kung pao chicken, a spicy chicken stir-fry coated in chilli sauce, but they asked for the sauce on the side. After checking with them twice, I fulfilled their strange request and brought them two plates of naked chicken. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d one asked. They insisted that they had asked for extra sauce on the side. Then they asked for a small plate, but the plate I brought them didn\u2019t have tall enough sides. When I brought them a bowl instead, they asked me if I was stupid. By the time I gave them their bill, they\u2019d clocked my name from my tag and started using it as a synonym for screwing up. As in: \u201cThere she goes, another Lillian.\u201d The entire time, they talked about me to one another as if I couldn\u2019t hear, or understand. But I won\u2019t pretend that I experienced the same treatment as my co-workers. I was the only server born in America, with English as my first language, while my co-workers spoke English as a second, third, sometimes fourth language. After I\u2019d spoken a few times to the people I was serving, some of them would start to warm up and actually look me in the eye. This confirmed what I was beginning to realise: that having a Chinese face in a Chinese restaurant added an extra level of alienation. But the end was in sight. This was not a for ever job: I would be leaving at the end of the summer, when I moved to Michigan for graduate school. I could do anything for one summer, even if it meant never seeing my family or friends, even if the job exhausted me so much that I slept through my one day off a week. Surely, I would improve. But even as I got incrementally better, the job wasn\u2019t getting easier. I still couldn\u2019t balance a tray with more than four dishes. I still didn\u2019t know enough Chinese or Spanish to talk to anyone I worked with. I still wrote my orders in English, which only one cook could understand. And I was no tougher than I\u2019d been on day one. One dinner shift, I was so overwhelmed that I told a table of four to hang out for as long as they liked after they\u2019d paid their bill. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d they asked; they\u2019d already been hogging the table for two hours. \u201cIt\u2019ll make my shift easier,\u201d I said, even as I saw my manager giving them the evil eye. Finally, I hit breaking point. Not a huge accident or a blowout fight with my boss, but quite the opposite: I received a slight promotion. I had finally proven that I was a reliable enough waiter to participate in the daily section lottery. Before that, I was assigned the same section every lunch and dinner: a group of booths and tables that I could barely handle on a good day. But now I would have to draw a number with the other waiters during the afternoon meeting. I was eligible to serve the private party rooms that seated 40, and the banquet tables, too. \u201cImagine the tips!\u201d my co-workers told me. I imagined spilling beer down the backs of 40 people. Even barring an accident, I would have to, at the very least, wrap duck pancakes for every person sitting at the banquet table or in the private party room. A veteran waiter could wrap a pancake in 10 seconds. I sometimes took well over a minute. I didn\u2019t have to imagine myself moving slowly around a giant table as everyone watched and waited; I\u2019d lived a miniature version of that nightmare every night. For the first time, I wondered why was I still working at this restaurant. Why had I said yes to mandatory double shifts and no breaks on Saturdays and Sundays? Why hadn\u2019t I got a job at a different restaurant, with more tolerable working conditions? Or a job tutoring high school kids? I didn\u2019t need the money, and I didn\u2019t need the work experience. With a shattering burst of clarity, I realised that nothing was stopping me from quitting. I decided gleefully that this night would be my final one. Except, there was something. Driving home from work that night, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what I would tell my mother. My mother, who had put up with evil cooks and bad customers and backstabbing co-workers. Who had quit only because she\u2019d become pregnant with me. Our weeks of commiserating had been one of the first times I\u2019d felt that we were talking as equals. Now, I would return to being her soft, spoiled daughter. That night, after hours of hand-wringing, I went to her. I told her I was sorry, but that I didn\u2019t think I could work as a waitress any longer. I asked her if it was OK to quit. \u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d was her bewildered reply. \u201cBecause I need to know that you won\u2019t think less of me,\u201d I said, and started to cry. \u201cWhy would I think that?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe only people who do this work are the ones who have to. You don\u2019t have to, so of course you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Why else had she come up to my room every night to ask me about my day? Because she was my mother, yes, and her heart ached to think of me shaking under the weight of my big tray. But also because she knew that the only way you could feel like a human being in that job was if you had someone to talk to. At the end of the summer, my parents came with me to Michigan to help me move in. In return, I accompanied them to lunch with a woman I\u2019d never met, a woman who had once worked at the same restaurant as my mother. My mother called her Ah-Ping. She had reconnected with her through social media, around the same time I\u2019d started working at the restaurant. As we drove to her house in Ann Arbor, I didn\u2019t understand why we were going out of our way to see this person. \u201cShe\u2019s done well for herself,\u201d my mother said, as we approached a big, two-storey house. I heard pride in her voice. We rang the doorbell. Suddenly a tall, thin woman with glasses flung the door open and yelled my mother\u2019s name. They embraced, shouting, a reunion that surprised me with its joyfulness. Then, I understood. Ah-Ping had not just been a co-worker, or even a friend, but a lifeline. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have lasted if it weren\u2019t for Ah-Ping,\u201d my mother said, once we were inside the house. \u201cShe was my only friend at the restaurant.\u201d All the horror stories I\u2019d heard, Ah-Ping had heard first.

      "body": "<p>The scene with which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/aug/30/dj-taylor-interview\" title=\"\">DJ Taylor</a> begins his 26th book, <em>Lost Girls</em>, in which a girl enters, with some trepidation, a literary party in a house in Bloomsbury, is striking for many reasons. It is, as befits a Booker-longlisted novelist, involving and full of detail about the allotments that then took up the north side of this grand central London square, the railings taken for Spitfires, the bomb craters; it is an outsider\u2019s view of a world in which the reader is shortly to be entirely immersed. It is interesting because the girl is fictional and the scene a composite \u2013 there is no proof that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeorwell\" title=\"\">George Orwell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/28/decline-and-fall-on-tv-would-evelyn-waugh-have-approved\" title=\"\">Evelyn Waugh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/21/lucien-lucian-freud-obituary\" title=\"\">Lucian Freud</a>, Peter Quennell and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\" title=\"\">Cyril Connolly</a> actually stood together in that room, the offices of the literary magazine Horizon, in the autumn of 1942. And the scene is striking, above all, because Taylor has chosen to write it from the point of view of a woman, who in turn notices the women at the party most acutely, not the famous men.</p> <p>It was Quennell, poet, critic, biographer and general man-about-town, who first called Janetta Woolley, Lys Dunlap, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/27/barbara-skelton-socialite-networker-dj-taylor\" title=\"\">Barbara Skelton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/19/georgeorwell.biography\" title=\"\">Sonia Brownell</a> and a small penumbra of women like them \u201clost girls\u201d and although, a few pages from the end of his book, Taylor says \u201cany attempt to label ought to be resisted\u201d, it is a designation he finds remarkably useful. \u201cLost\u201d, he is clear, has nothing to do with moralistic Victorian put-downs. Rather it is a general \u201cair of waywardness and loneliness\u201d, as Quennell put it, and also of courage among a small band of good-looking, well-born, well-connected young women who for one reason and another \u2013 two world wars and the rackety, traumatised, inattentive family situations the wars left in their wake; an inchoate but powerful instinct to do something that fed their minds; an urge not to be constrained as their mothers had been \u2013 have a claim, Taylor argues, to being a missing link in the history of female emancipation between the bright young things of the late 20s and the burgeoning freedoms of the 60s.</p> <p>Woolley, who had a brief relationship with the much older Connolly when she was 17, was a painter.

      "bodyText": "The scene with which DJ Taylor begins his 26th book, Lost Girls, in which a girl enters, with some trepidation, a literary party in a house in Bloomsbury, is striking for many reasons. It is, as befits a Booker-longlisted novelist, involving and full of detail about the allotments that then took up the north side of this grand central London square, the railings taken for Spitfires, the bomb craters; it is an outsider\u2019s view of a world in which the reader is shortly to be entirely immersed. It is interesting because the girl is fictional and the scene a composite \u2013 there is no proof that George Orwell, Evelyn Waugh, Lucian Freud, Peter Quennell and Cyril Connolly actually stood together in that room, the offices of the literary magazine Horizon, in the autumn of 1942. And the scene is striking, above all, because Taylor has chosen to write it from the point of view of a woman, who in turn notices the women at the party most acutely, not the famous men. It was Quennell, poet, critic, biographer and general man-about-town, who first called Janetta Woolley, Lys Dunlap, Barbara Skelton, Sonia Brownell and a small penumbra of women like them \u201clost girls\u201d and although, a few pages from the end of his book, Taylor says \u201cany attempt to label ought to be resisted\u201d, it is a designation he finds remarkably useful. \u201cLost\u201d, he is clear, has nothing to do with moralistic Victorian put-downs. Rather it is a general \u201cair of waywardness and loneliness\u201d, as Quennell put it, and also of courage among a small band of good-looking, well-born, well-connected young women who for one reason and another \u2013 two world wars and the rackety, traumatised, inattentive family situations the wars left in their wake; an inchoate but powerful instinct to do something that fed their minds; an urge not to be constrained as their mothers had been \u2013 have a claim, Taylor argues, to being a missing link in the history of female emancipation between the bright young things of the late 20s and the burgeoning freedoms of the 60s. Woolley, who had a brief relationship with the much older Connolly when she was 17, was a painter. Dunlap was orphaned in her mid-teens, worked as a typist and model and was already married when she met Connolly, whose life she then efficiently and loyally ran for most of the next decade. Skelton, who was married to Connolly for six years, left home at 15 and by 17 was the sports-car-driving, Paris high life-enjoying lover of a millionaire.

      "body": "<h2>Lily Kuo, the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief</h2> <p>The Hong Kong protests have been one of the most important stories I\u2019ve covered this year. The outpouring from the public, the polarisation of society and the difficult situation Beijing finds itself in have been unprecedented.</p> <p>The series of demonstrations began with the goal of withdrawing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/09/hong-kong-carrie-lam-says-extradition-bill-is-dead-but-stops-short-of-withdrawal\">extradition bill proposed by the Hong Kong government</a>. If enacted, the bill would allow local authorities to detain and extradite people who are wanted in territories that Hong Kong does not have extradition agreements with, including mainland China and Taiwan. The goal of the protesters has since evolved beyond this original aim. It\u2019s a story that deserves all the focus and energy we can give. Yet now, we are three months in and I don\u2019t think anyone, even the protesters, expected this to go on so long. <br><br>For me, one challenge has been making sure we stay alert and fresh \u2013 that we don\u2019t burn out. On big protest days, it\u2019s not uncommon for us to work more than 13 hours. That could be a combination of attending a march, following protesters who have splintered off to other locations, then witnessing clashes with riot police that inevitably end in teargas, rubber bullets, beatings or, most recently, real guns being pulled out.<br><br>Because the protests have taken many forms, from road blockades to peaceful marches, the range of feelings while covering them has also been wide. Some moments have felt surreal, peaceful and contemplative; others chaotic and disorienting. <br><br>The protests have been one of the few times in my career that I have been so clearly identified as a journalist \u2013 we wear hi-vis vests and helmets with the word: PRESS. In the same way that the protesters and police have their uniforms, this traffic warden-like outfit also feels like one. Sometimes people try to give me food or water. Once, during an especially long day, a woman washing her hands next to me in a bathroom patted me on the shoulder and said: <em>jia you</em> \u2013 \u201cadd oil\u201d or \u201ckeep going\u201d.<br><br>When I ask protesters why they are still coming to the streets, some say they don\u2019t want to see Hong Kong turned into another Chinese city. They cite the detention of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, activists imprisoned for years on trumped up charges, or the plan for a nationwide \u201csocial credit system\u201d, which they see as the culmination of a digital police state. Because I\u2019ve spent the last year reporting on many of these issues, this answer often makes the deepest impression on me.</p> <p>Emma Graham-Harrison covered many of the earliest protests, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/16/man-falls-to-his-death-to-become-hong-kong-protests-first-martyr\">a vigil for a man</a> who had fallen to his death after unfurling a protest banner, which was a turning point for many protesters. She profiled Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who has been a major target of the protests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/carrie-lam-hong-kong-chief-executive-china-beijing-puppet\">is seen as </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/carrie-lam-hong-kong-chief-executive-china-beijing-puppet\">a puppet of Beijing</a>. She has followed Beijing\u2019s increasingly ominous warnings to Hong Kong and the possibility of a military intervention.</p> <p>Helen Davidson, a reporter for Guardian Australia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/12/waiting-for-a-miracle-hope-and-resolve-on-the-streets-of-hong-kong\">captured protesters\u2019 voices in one of the first major protests</a> on 12 June. Before the protests kicked off, she reported on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/the-last-fight-for-hong-kong-activists-gear-up-to-protest-extradition-law\">details of the extradition law</a>, shedding much-needed light on why the bill prompted such widespread anger. Davidson, along with other reporters in Australia such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/naaman-zhou\">Naaman Zhou</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-smee\">Ben Smee</a>, have covered pro-Hong Kong protests there \u2013 some of which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/04/we-cannot-be-seen-the-fallout-from-the-university-of-queenslands-hong-kong-protests\">resulted in clashes with mainland Chinese students</a>.</p> <p>From London and Hong Kong, Ben Quinn and I profiled a group of protesters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/28/hong-kong-protest-take-democracy-struggle-uk-politicians\">launching an aggressive awareness campaign in the UK</a> through social media and newspaper ad buys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dae142d592fb056cad93c2d0e09eeee59d43a568\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dae142d592fb056cad93c2d0e09eeee59d43a568/0_243_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riot police near small fires on a road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riot police outside the British consulate in Hong Kong during a protest on 24 August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tania Branigan, the Guardian\u2019s foreign leader writer, who spent seven years as China correspondent</h2> <p>As China correspondent of the Guardian for seven years, I found reporting in Hong Kong was a breeze compared with working on the mainland \u2013 people were so ready to talk.

      "bodyText": "Lily Kuo, the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief The Hong Kong protests have been one of the most important stories I\u2019ve covered this year. The outpouring from the public, the polarisation of society and the difficult situation Beijing finds itself in have been unprecedented. The series of demonstrations began with the goal of withdrawing an extradition bill proposed by the Hong Kong government. If enacted, the bill would allow local authorities to detain and extradite people who are wanted in territories that Hong Kong does not have extradition agreements with, including mainland China and Taiwan. The goal of the protesters has since evolved beyond this original aim. It\u2019s a story that deserves all the focus and energy we can give. Yet now, we are three months in and I don\u2019t think anyone, even the protesters, expected this to go on so long. For me, one challenge has been making sure we stay alert and fresh \u2013 that we don\u2019t burn out. On big protest days, it\u2019s not uncommon for us to work more than 13 hours. That could be a combination of attending a march, following protesters who have splintered off to other locations, then witnessing clashes with riot police that inevitably end in teargas, rubber bullets, beatings or, most recently, real guns being pulled out. Because the protests have taken many forms, from road blockades to peaceful marches, the range of feelings while covering them has also been wide. Some moments have felt surreal, peaceful and contemplative; others chaotic and disorienting. The protests have been one of the few times in my career that I have been so clearly identified as a journalist \u2013 we wear hi-vis vests and helmets with the word: PRESS. In the same way that the protesters and police have their uniforms, this traffic warden-like outfit also feels like one. Sometimes people try to give me food or water. Once, during an especially long day, a woman washing her hands next to me in a bathroom patted me on the shoulder and said: jia you \u2013 \u201cadd oil\u201d or \u201ckeep going\u201d. When I ask protesters why they are still coming to the streets, some say they don\u2019t want to see Hong Kong turned into another Chinese city. They cite the detention of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, activists imprisoned for years on trumped up charges, or the plan for a nationwide \u201csocial credit system\u201d, which they see as the culmination of a digital police state. Because I\u2019ve spent the last year reporting on many of these issues, this answer often makes the deepest impression on me. Emma Graham-Harrison covered many of the earliest protests, including a vigil for a man who had fallen to his death after unfurling a protest banner, which was a turning point for many protesters. She profiled Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who has been a major target of the protests and is seen as a puppet of Beijing. She has followed Beijing\u2019s increasingly ominous warnings to Hong Kong and the possibility of a military intervention. Helen Davidson, a reporter for Guardian Australia, captured protesters\u2019 voices in one of the first major protests on 12 June. Before the protests kicked off, she reported on the details of the extradition law, shedding much-needed light on why the bill prompted such widespread anger. Davidson, along with other reporters in Australia such as Naaman Zhou and Ben Smee, have covered pro-Hong Kong protests there \u2013 some of which have resulted in clashes with mainland Chinese students. From London and Hong Kong, Ben Quinn and I profiled a group of protesters launching an aggressive awareness campaign in the UK through social media and newspaper ad buys. Tania Branigan, the Guardian\u2019s foreign leader writer, who spent seven years as China correspondent As China correspondent of the Guardian for seven years, I found reporting in Hong Kong was a breeze compared with working on the mainland \u2013 people were so ready to talk. When the \u201cumbrella movement\u201d erupted in 2014, protesters happily identified themselves in full. Some offered themselves on loan as interpreters. Others sought out reporters to have their say. What followed the movement \u2013 including the jailing of protest leaders and the disqualification of elected legislators \u2013 has made people much more cautious this time. Attacks on protesters and sackings for participation in demonstrations have added to concerns. Even at approved protests, people are increasingly likely to at least cover their faces with masks (often adding sunglasses, hats and so on) and to take precautions such as using burner phones and single tickets rather than travel cards.

(And, of course, reporting in Hong Kong is still incomparably more straightforward than on the mainland.) Unlike five years ago, this is a leaderless movement.

Even when they disagree over what actions to take, in particular the growing use of force, participants refuse to distance themselves from each other. What also unifies them is that no one pretends to know where this is heading. Verna Yu, freelance writer based in Hong Kong Three months ago, no one would have expected Hong Kong, an Asian financial hub, to plunge into a prolonged and unprecedented political crisis. Having covered the anti-extradition movement from the first protest on 9 June, I have been touched by the palpable sense of solidarity in numerous rallies and marches. From marching in massive downpours to standing for hours under the sweltering sun in extreme humidity, one cannot help but feel moved by the protesters who remain orderly and polite to one another. I am also impressed by the wide support for this movement.

Making aviation history is hard graft, but if the team\u2019s latest endeavour, <a href=\"http://aerodelft.nl/project-phoenix/\">Project Phoenix</a>, is successful, flying could become not just the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/24/avoid-air-travel-mh17-math-risk-guide\">safest form of long-distance transport</a>, but eventually also the greenest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54a224a6cd32901f40fe8250f7ecbb55239d9940\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54a224a6cd32901f40fe8250f7ecbb55239d9940/46_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The fuel tank inside aircraft, whose principal emission is water vapour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fuel tank inside aircraft, whose principal emission is water vapour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Project Pheonix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A shiny white, yellow and blue prototype for Project Pheonix\u2019s motor glider was unveiled in April to a ticketed audience, and boasts a range greater than 2,000km, at a cruising speed of 200km/h, on just one tank of liquid hydrogen.</p> \n<p>Inside Phoenix\u2019s simple, tented workshop within Delft\u2019s <a href=\"https://thetecfactory.nl/\">Tec Factory</a>, the ambitious project, says Megill, is \u201cslowly becoming a reality\u201d, as daily deliveries \u2013 from 100 metre rolls of fibreglass to tiny electrical components \u2013 begin piling up. The full-scale, two-seater aircraft should be ready for testing by 2021, and Megill, a qualified flight instructor, may even pilot it himself.</p> \n<p>The design features a pioneering \u201cboundary layer suction\u201d: 14m tiny perforations on the wing to reduce drag. Safety features include sensors and vents, in case of a hydrogen leakage, and an electric battery should the fuel cell fail. Revisiting hydrogen since the Hindenburg (1937) and Challenger (1986) disasters can be a hard sell. \u201cIn the public\u2019s mind, they still have hydrogen as a very scary, difficult substance to use,\u201d acknowledges Megill. \u201c[But] it isn\u2019t all that much.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hydrogen, the lightest and most abundant element, produces <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/21357711/CRYOPLANE_HYDROGEN_VS._KEROSENE_AS_AIRCRAFT_FUEL\">three times more energy</a> per kilo than kerosene, although in gas form (at 700 bar), is six times the volume and requires heavy compression tanks. Phoenix keeps the hydrogen in liquid form by storing it at -253C (-423F), halving the space needed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-12T13:26:30/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-12T13:26:30/embed.html\">chart</a> \n</figure> \n<p>But hydrogen\u2019s trump card is that, when mixed with oxygen to create electricity, it emits nothing but water vapour, unlike conventional jet fuels, which are spewing out ever larger amounts of carbon dioxide every year.</p> \n<p>AeroDelft is investigating measures such as storage tanks to ensure that all water is released at low altitude or in dry air to prevent cloud creation which can have a greenhouse effect.</p> \n<p>Liquid hydrogen has been flight tested as far back as 1988, with the Soviet Union\u2019s Tu-155. But like Boeing\u2019s Phantom Eye 25 years later, it relied on a combustion engine, losing about 70% of the fuel in forces of friction and heat. Phoenix\u2019s liquid hydrogen fuel cell, explains Megill, will be twice as energy efficient as a fuel-burning system.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b6a9272478ddcddd2f090bfd54f59f91c07bcaa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b6a9272478ddcddd2f090bfd54f59f91c07bcaa/0_0_4838_2903/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first test flight of Solar Impulse 2 in Abu Dhabi, UAE, a plane whose electric batteries are 97% energy efficient and powered by the sun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first test flight of Solar Impulse 2 in Abu Dhabi, UAE, a plane whose electric batteries are 97% energy efficient and powered by the sun.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Solar Impulse | Revillard | Rezo.ch</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sceptics point out that most hydrogen is still produced using steam methane reforming (SMR), which even with carbon capture and storage, still creates <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/hydrogen-production/energy-briefing-green-hydrogen.pdf\">as much as 150g</a> of greenhouse gases per kWh. Creating hydrogen via electrolysis is more costly and the process (excluding manufacturing)is carbon neutral only if the electricity is generated with renewables.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you produce hydrogen in a dirty way, it has no advantage over kerosene,\u201d says clean technology expert Bertrand Piccard, who, in 2016, completed a carbon-free flight around the globe in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/26/solar-impulse-plane-makes-history-completing-round-the-world-trip\">Solar Impulse</a>, a plane whose electric batteries were 97% energy efficient and powered only by the sun.</p> \n<p>Piccard\u2019s achievement was widely heralded. But the solar option looks a long way from becoming a mass-market alternative. Scaling up the single-seat aircraft, whose solar-cell-covered wingspan was already as large as a jumbo jet, is still problematic.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not tomorrow that we fly fully solar aeroplanes with passengers \u2026 but it will come,\u201d says Piccard, who points to fuel-saving aircraft towing systems (ATS) and route-optimising software such as <a href=\"https://openairlines.com/skybreathe-fuel-efficiency/\">SkyBreathe</a> as \u201can intermediate way\u201d to reduce the carbon cost of flying.</p> \n<p>The other technology under exploration is battery-powered aircraft. Norway announced last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/18/norway-aims-for-all-short-haul-flights-to-be-100-electric-by-2040\">that it wants all short-haul flights to be electric by 2040</a>. But sceptics counter that battery cells will never be enough to power big aircraft and long-haul flights, and that hybrid solutions will have to come first.</p> \n<p>Though hydrogen production is <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/renewable-hydrogen-already-cost-competative-say-researchers\">increasingly efficient</a> and projects such as <a href=\"https://www.bighit.eu/\">B</a><a href=\"https://www.bighit.eu/\">ig Hit</a> on the Orkney Islands and <a href=\"https://www.airliquide.com/magazine/hybalance-towards-carbon-free-hydrogen\">HyBalance</a> in Denmark are good examples of hydrogen being produced efficiently, fully sustainable hydrogen-based aviation is still some way off.</p> \n<p>\u201cHydrogen would be facing a strong headwind if it wants to be the solution to sustainable aviation, especially in the timescale that we know we have to act,\u201d says Julian Beach of Green Fuels, the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of biodiesel equipment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7529e103e62a418329c3d13e7ce5d5cad43f6df\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7529e103e62a418329c3d13e7ce5d5cad43f6df/0_237_2987_1793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Phoenix Project aircraft.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Phoenix Project aircraft.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Project Pheonix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Biofuels, for their part, have been extensively criticised for the huge amounts of land that would be required to produce sufficient quantities of fuel to make a difference.</p> \n<p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.verifavia.com/greenhouse-gas-verification/fq-which-states-are-participating-in-corsia-250.php\">69 countries</a>, including the Netherlands and the UK, voluntarily signed up to <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/policy/environment/Documents/corsia-factsheet.pdf\">Corsia</a> (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) targets, which include more than halving aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2050.</p> \n<p>For Megill, a carbon-free future for aviation requires time, courage and collaboration. \u201cOur goal is to show that it works and hopefully convince others to make the infrastructure to make green hydrogen,\u201d he says. He hopes that by 2030 the technology that the Phoenix has demonstrated could be used to create a commercial passenger aircraft, but a major investor would need to take over.</p> \n<p>A 1:3 scale model of Phoenix, with a wing span of 5.7 metres, will make its maiden flight next year, doubtless highlighting once again that carbon-neutral flying is technically possible, and that liquid hydrogen is a potentially sustainable fuel. Until investors see the value in that, flying less is probably still the best path of travel.</p> \n<p><em>This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

      "bodyText": "\u201cFlight shaming is not going to solve all our problems,\u201d says Liam Megill at the start of another marathon day trying to make aviation history. \u201cYou can\u2019t take a train to the [United] States, so instead we have to make flying sustainable.\u201d Greta Thunberg demonstrated this week that you can travel long haul without burning fossil fuels. But not everyone can travel on a zero-carbon yacht. In the global battle against carbon, aviation is one of the toughest challenges of all. Grids are getting ever greener thanks to renewables, cars are going electric, even construction is exploring new ways to become more sustainable. But air travel is popular, dirty and, most importantly of all, hard to power with anything other than hydrocarbons. That\u2019s where Megill comes in. The German-Canadian is seeking the holy grail of air travel \u2013 a manned aircraft powered by a liquid hydrogen fuel cell. The technology, engineered by the non-profit organisation AeroDelft which he co-founded in 2017, promises a sort of atmospheric alchemy: a power source whose principal emission is water vapour. It\u2019s 8am and Megill has an 18-hour day ahead of him, culminating in a nail-biting control and systems test flight at nearby Rozenburg, the Netherlands, and then back to the workshop until 2am to finalise the wing and tail mould designs, paint part of the internal fuselage and run some simulations. Making aviation history is hard graft, but if the team\u2019s latest endeavour, Project Phoenix, is successful, flying could become not just the safest form of long-distance transport, but eventually also the greenest. A shiny white, yellow and blue prototype for Project Pheonix\u2019s motor glider was unveiled in April to a ticketed audience, and boasts a range greater than 2,000km, at a cruising speed of 200km/h, on just one tank of liquid hydrogen. Inside Phoenix\u2019s simple, tented workshop within Delft\u2019s Tec Factory, the ambitious project, says Megill, is \u201cslowly becoming a reality\u201d, as daily deliveries \u2013 from 100 metre rolls of fibreglass to tiny electrical components \u2013 begin piling up. The full-scale, two-seater aircraft should be ready for testing by 2021, and Megill, a qualified flight instructor, may even pilot it himself. The design features a pioneering \u201cboundary layer suction\u201d: 14m tiny perforations on the wing to reduce drag. Safety features include sensors and vents, in case of a hydrogen leakage, and an electric battery should the fuel cell fail. Revisiting hydrogen since the Hindenburg (1937) and Challenger (1986) disasters can be a hard sell. \u201cIn the public\u2019s mind, they still have hydrogen as a very scary, difficult substance to use,\u201d acknowledges Megill. \u201c[But] it isn\u2019t all that much.\u201d Hydrogen, the lightest and most abundant element, produces three times more energy per kilo than kerosene, although in gas form (at 700 bar), is six times the volume and requires heavy compression tanks. Phoenix keeps the hydrogen in liquid form by storing it at -253C (-423F), halving the space needed. But hydrogen\u2019s trump card is that, when mixed with oxygen to create electricity, it emits nothing but water vapour, unlike conventional jet fuels, which are spewing out ever larger amounts of carbon dioxide every year. AeroDelft is investigating measures such as storage tanks to ensure that all water is released at low altitude or in dry air to prevent cloud creation which can have a greenhouse effect. Liquid hydrogen has been flight tested as far back as 1988, with the Soviet Union\u2019s Tu-155. But like Boeing\u2019s Phantom Eye 25 years later, it relied on a combustion engine, losing about 70% of the fuel in forces of friction and heat. Phoenix\u2019s liquid hydrogen fuel cell, explains Megill, will be twice as energy efficient as a fuel-burning system. Sceptics point out that most hydrogen is still produced using steam methane reforming (SMR), which even with carbon capture and storage, still creates as much as 150g of greenhouse gases per kWh. Creating hydrogen via electrolysis is more costly and the process (excluding manufacturing)is carbon neutral only if the electricity is generated with renewables. \u201cIf you produce hydrogen in a dirty way, it has no advantage over kerosene,\u201d says clean technology expert Bertrand Piccard, who, in 2016, completed a carbon-free flight around the globe in Solar Impulse, a plane whose electric batteries were 97% energy efficient and powered only by the sun. Piccard\u2019s achievement was widely heralded. But the solar option looks a long way from becoming a mass-market alternative. Scaling up the single-seat aircraft, whose solar-cell-covered wingspan was already as large as a jumbo jet, is still problematic. \u201cIt\u2019s not tomorrow that we fly fully solar aeroplanes with passengers \u2026 but it will come,\u201d says Piccard, who points to fuel-saving aircraft towing systems (ATS) and route-optimising software such as SkyBreathe as \u201can intermediate way\u201d to reduce the carbon cost of flying. The other technology under exploration is battery-powered aircraft. Norway announced last year that it wants all short-haul flights to be electric by 2040. But sceptics counter that battery cells will never be enough to power big aircraft and long-haul flights, and that hybrid solutions will have to come first. Though hydrogen production is increasingly efficient and projects such as Big Hit on the Orkney Islands and HyBalance in Denmark are good examples of hydrogen being produced efficiently, fully sustainable hydrogen-based aviation is still some way off. \u201cHydrogen would be facing a strong headwind if it wants to be the solution to sustainable aviation, especially in the timescale that we know we have to act,\u201d says Julian Beach of Green Fuels, the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of biodiesel equipment. Biofuels, for their part, have been extensively criticised for the huge amounts of land that would be required to produce sufficient quantities of fuel to make a difference. In 2017, 69 countries, including the Netherlands and the UK, voluntarily signed up to Corsia (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) targets, which include more than halving aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2050. For Megill, a carbon-free future for aviation requires time, courage and collaboration. \u201cOur goal is to show that it works and hopefully convince others to make the infrastructure to make green hydrogen,\u201d he says. He hopes that by 2030 the technology that the Phoenix has demonstrated could be used to create a commercial passenger aircraft, but a major investor would need to take over. A 1:3 scale model of Phoenix, with a wing span of 5.7 metres, will make its maiden flight next year, doubtless highlighting once again that carbon-neutral flying is technically possible, and that liquid hydrogen is a potentially sustainable fuel. Until investors see the value in that, flying less is probably still the best path of travel.

For British boats to catch what EU boats now catch \u2013 the so-called \u201csea of opportunity\u201d \u2013 would demand radical changes in British eating habits and/or fish processing and exporting industries. Neither can happen overnight. Where would we wish to export much of the promised El Dorado of fish? To the European Union. In the immediate wake of a no-deal Brexit, British fishermen may end up with the worst of all worlds. They will face calamitous delays and bureaucracy on overnight fish sales to the continent. The government will be obliged by international law to delay distribution of quotas while it enters lengthy talks with the EU27 and the Norwegians. One British inshore fishing industry leader said: \u201cIf Brexit happens, there will, eventually, be a few people who make a lot of money. But they will probably be the big-scale skippers and industrial-scale companies who are already rich. I don\u2019t see much for struggling coastal communities or smaller fishermen. Those who depend on the EU market could be wiped out.\u201d Conclusion. You can win a political argument with lies and myths. Governing or negotiating with them is as useful as fishing without nets. \u2022 John Lichfield is a journalist based in France",

      "body": "<p>An English state school has suspended more than half its pupils in a single year for the first time on record, Guardian analysis has found, as national exclusion rates continue to rise.</p> <p>Red House academy in Sunderland, run by the Northern Education Trust, an academy chain, recorded the highest fixed-term exclusion rate in England in the 2017-18 academic year. It handed at least one fixed-term exclusion to 254 pupils, just over half the total attending the school.</p> <p>Forty-one schools excluded more than one in five pupils, or roughly 10 times the national rate of 2.3%. Two academy chains \u2013 Outwood Grange Academies Trust and the Northern Education Trust \u2013 dominated that list with nine and seven of their schools featuring respectively.</p> <p>The Northern Education Trust runs 19 schools across the north of England, while Outwood Grange Academies Trust runs 31 schools in the north and the east Midlands. Rob Tarn, the trust\u2019s chief executive, was previously the regional CEO (north) for Outwood Grange Academies Trust <a href=\"https://academytoday.co.uk/Article/northern-education-trust-appoints-rob-tarn-as-chief-executiv\">until March 2017</a>. According to the Northern Education Trust\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.northerneducationtrust.org/information/financial-information/\">accounts</a>, he was paid \u00a3183,000 last year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/permanent-and-fixed-period-exclusions-in-england-2017-to-2018\">latest DfE figures</a> show that in the 2017-18 school year the rate of fixed-term exclusions increased for a fourth year in a row.

      "bodyText": "An English state school has suspended more than half its pupils in a single year for the first time on record, Guardian analysis has found, as national exclusion rates continue to rise. Red House academy in Sunderland, run by the Northern Education Trust, an academy chain, recorded the highest fixed-term exclusion rate in England in the 2017-18 academic year. It handed at least one fixed-term exclusion to 254 pupils, just over half the total attending the school. Forty-one schools excluded more than one in five pupils, or roughly 10 times the national rate of 2.3%. Two academy chains \u2013 Outwood Grange Academies Trust and the Northern Education Trust \u2013 dominated that list with nine and seven of their schools featuring respectively. The Northern Education Trust runs 19 schools across the north of England, while Outwood Grange Academies Trust runs 31 schools in the north and the east Midlands. Rob Tarn, the trust\u2019s chief executive, was previously the regional CEO (north) for Outwood Grange Academies Trust until March 2017. According to the Northern Education Trust\u2019s accounts, he was paid \u00a3183,000 last year. The latest DfE figures show that in the 2017-18 school year the rate of fixed-term exclusions increased for a fourth year in a row. A fixed-term exclusion is where a pupil is formally suspended from school for a set time, usually up to three days. The average length of exclusion last year was two days. This week the Guardian published leaked government plans to improve behaviour in schools by extending exclusions and the use of \u201creasonable force\u201d, prompting teachers and charity leaders to express concern that such a move could target disadvantaged pupils. This year\u2019s highest fixed-term exclusion rate was significantly higher than last year\u2019s, which was recorded by the Outwood-run Outwood Academy Ormesby in Middlesbrough. The school excluded 41% of its pupils in the 2016-17 academic year. The school with the second-highest exclusion rate in 2017-18 was North Shore academy in Stockton-on-Tees, which is also part of the Northern Education Trust. It suspended just over 40% of pupils. There is growing debate over the use of \u201czero-tolerance\u201d or \u201cno excuses\u201d behaviour policies, including the regular use of isolation and sending pupils home for apparently minor indiscretions. Some argue that such approaches are necessary to raise standards and ensure a calm learning environment, while others say they cause children with complex needs to miss out on education. The DfE figures show that schools with highest exclusion rates had on average 32% of pupils receiving free school meals \u2013 more than double the national average, which is 15%. At Red House the rate was 46.5%. Academies accounted for 39 of the 41 schools with the highest exclusion rates. The other two were run by their local authority. In November 2017, the Northern Education Trust and Outwood Grange Academies Trust joined other academy chains to form the Northern Alliance of Trusts, which was described as the first formal partnership of its kind between larger trusts. Delta Academies Trust, one of the eight members, is run by Rob Tarn\u2019s brother Paul Tarn, who also used to work at Outwood. Two Delta schools appear on the list of 41 with the highest exclusion rates. The Tarn brothers told the TES last year that the alliance aimed to raise aspirations in deprived communities in the north. One teacher who has worked at a Northern Education Trust school with high exclusion rates told the Guardian he had witnessed pupils being excluded for what he said were minor offences, from wearing jewellery to having eyebrows that were deemed too dark. \u201c[The trust take over] these very, very deprived schools and they come in with a one-size-fits-all approach and say: \u2018If you don\u2019t do things our way then you are out, simple as.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of militaristic,\u201d he said. The teacher said pupils often fell behind with their work because they were being excluded so much. \u201cThere were times when I was teaching 25 kids and you had four or five different groups of starting points because so many of them had been given fixed-term exclusions.\u201d Another teacher, who worked at an Outwood school with a high exclusion rate, said it was heartbreaking to see pupils being suspended for trivial reasons. \u201cThere were students we really cared for and with whom we had put in a lot of time to build relationships with and that trust was completely wiped out,\u201d she said. Philip Tye, a councillor in Sunderland who sits on the local authority\u2019s children, education and skills scrutiny committee, said it had been concerned about the high rates of exclusions at a number of schools in the area including Red House. \u201cIt fundamentally affects the education of the child because obviously if they are not in school they are not being educated,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the robust approach taken when parents want to take their kids out of school for a couple of days to go on holiday, yet they\u2019re saying they can exclude pupils and it won\u2019t have an impact on their education.\u201d A spokesperson for the Northern Education Trust said the proportion of students at Red House academy who attained a pass in English and maths had risen from 32% in 2017 to 58% this year. \u201cGood discipline in schools is essential in ensuring that all children receive the best education possible,\u201d the spokesperson said. Arguing that the trust\u2019s approach was common to all good schools, the spokesperson added: \u201cExcluding students for short periods to reflect on their behaviour does not mean that we give up on them, it means we care enough to say no.\u201d A spokesperson for Outwood Grange Academies Trust said it took on schools that needed improvement in the most vulnerable parts of the country, and all but one of its inspected academies had been rated as either outstanding or good by Ofsted. The spokesperson said the use of fixed-term exclusions had fallen by 29% across the trust since last year. \u201cOur approach of using short suspensions in the face of extreme behaviours from students, along with significant support to help students obtain record results quickly, is a successful one,\u201d they said. The spokesperson provided a handwritten note from an anonymised year 10 pupil at Outwood Grange Bishopsgarth, which suspended 36% of its pupils last year, saying the school had improved since the trust took it over. \u201cI realised that school wasn\u2019t a joke and that grades do matter,\u201d it said. The Guardian analysed publicly available exclusions data on English state schools, excluding special schools, pupil referral units and schools with fewer than 100 pupils. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cHeadteachers do not take the decision to exclude lightly and we will continue to back them in using permanent exclusion as a last resort. Moreover, exclusion from school should not mean exclusion from education.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As the government prepares to prorogue parliament and a no-deal Brexit becomes an ominous probability, the contentious matter of the \u201cIrish backstop\u201d is no longer a technical complication in a wider political argument: it is now a tangible, terrifying crisis in itself. Will our leaders, in their rash drive to force through Brexit at all costs, really risk a hard border in Ireland after such hard-won peace between north and south? Have the Troubles been forgotten so soon?</p> <p>It\u2019s surely with that rhetorical question in mind that Channel 4 and Film4 have rather cunningly kicked off September with a film mini-season dedicated to cinema of the Troubles \u2013 broadcast at scheduled night-owl times, but rather more conveniently continued on their All4 streaming service. The centrepiece of it all \u2013 premiering on Channel 4 tonight, before hitting All4 for 30 days \u2013 is <strong><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/50-years-of-the-troubles-a-journey\" title=\"\">50 Years of the Troubles: A Journey Through Film</a></strong>, an hour-long documentary from irrepressible, Belfast-born film historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/23/dear-boris-johnson-watch-these-six-films-before-you-rip-up-the-irish-backstop-and-trigger-violence\" title=\"\">Mark Cousins</a>, in which he considers the role cinema played as both an escape route and a representative snapshot for Irish folk caught in the turmoil.</p> <p>Narrated in Cousins\u2019s signature discursive style as it considers everything from <em>Annie Get Your Gun</em> to <em><a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/fast-track-fandom-where-begin-alan-clarke\" title=\"\">The Devil\u2019s Own</a></em>, it\u2019s a gentle jumping-off point for the robust trio of films programmed by Film4 to supplement his commentary: <strong><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/71\" title=\"\">\u201971</a></strong>, Yann Demange\u2019s heart-in-mouth study of a British soldier stranded in an IRA stronghold;<strong><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-crying-game\" title=\"\"> The Crying Game</a></strong>, Neil Jordan\u2019s still-crackling collision of national and sexual politics, which holds up even if we all know the once-ballyhooed twist; and <strong><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/hunger\" title=\"\">Hunger</a></strong>, the stark, tactile Bobby Sands portrait that remains Steve McQueen\u2019s greatest film to date.

(Paul Greengrass\u2019s <em>Bloody Sunday</em> and Pat O\u2019Connor\u2019s <em>Cal</em> are oddly awol, while Alan Clarke\u2019s brutal, seminal short <em>Elephant</em> can only be found chopped into four videos <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9670o\" title=\"\">on Dailymotion</a> \u2013 hardly the way it should be watched.) The BFI Player, however, reliably pitches in with <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-maeve-1981-online\" title=\"\">Maeve</a></strong>, a remarkable, little-seen feminist angle on the era from 1981, following a young woman returning to Belfast after a long spell in London and defiantly asserting herself to her family and her republican lover. Pat Murphy\u2019s film puts a gendered spin on Anglo-Irish relations too: it remains spiky and thought-provoking.</p> <p>If you only associate Ken Loach with kitchen-sink realism, the jittery conspiracy-thriller mechanics of his 1990 film <strong>Hidden Agenda</strong> <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/hidden-agenda-1990/id869249000?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\" title=\"\">(available on iTunes</a>) may surprise you. Starring Frances McDormand as an American lawyer on a mission to uncover the British government\u2019s crimes against the Northern Irish, it\u2019s one of his most overtly entertaining films \u2013 but still steams with righteous Loachian fury. Still underrated, meanwhile, is James Marsh\u2019s coolly empathetic <strong>Shadow Dancer</strong> (2012), available <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Shadow_Dancer?gl=GB&amp;hl=en&amp;id=W2FTMwr-ZyU\" title=\"\">on Google Play</a>, among other outlets, with its taut, fierce performance from Andrea Riseborough as a cagey IRA terrorist turned MI5 informant.</p> <p>Not everything under this thematic banner, however, has to be sobering or outright despairing \u2013 or even for adults. As a chaser to all that grit, <strong>Mickybo and Me</strong> (available <a href=\"https://www.skystore.com/product/mickybo-and-me/eeabca31-5e79-441b-a56a-93ab995efe8e\" title=\"\">on SkyStore</a>) offers a gentle, sweet-natured growing-up portrait of two boys (one Catholic, one Protestant, mutually worshipful of Butch Cassidy) in 1970 Belfast, who dream of escaping their troubles in all senses and journeying to Australia.

      "bodyText": "As the government prepares to prorogue parliament and a no-deal Brexit becomes an ominous probability, the contentious matter of the \u201cIrish backstop\u201d is no longer a technical complication in a wider political argument: it is now a tangible, terrifying crisis in itself. Will our leaders, in their rash drive to force through Brexit at all costs, really risk a hard border in Ireland after such hard-won peace between north and south? Have the Troubles been forgotten so soon? It\u2019s surely with that rhetorical question in mind that Channel 4 and Film4 have rather cunningly kicked off September with a film mini-season dedicated to cinema of the Troubles \u2013 broadcast at scheduled night-owl times, but rather more conveniently continued on their All4 streaming service. The centrepiece of it all \u2013 premiering on Channel 4 tonight, before hitting All4 for 30 days \u2013 is 50 Years of the Troubles: A Journey Through Film, an hour-long documentary from irrepressible, Belfast-born film historian Mark Cousins, in which he considers the role cinema played as both an escape route and a representative snapshot for Irish folk caught in the turmoil. Narrated in Cousins\u2019s signature discursive style as it considers everything from Annie Get Your Gun to The Devil\u2019s Own, it\u2019s a gentle jumping-off point for the robust trio of films programmed by Film4 to supplement his commentary: \u201971, Yann Demange\u2019s heart-in-mouth study of a British soldier stranded in an IRA stronghold; The Crying Game, Neil Jordan\u2019s still-crackling collision of national and sexual politics, which holds up even if we all know the once-ballyhooed twist; and Hunger, the stark, tactile Bobby Sands portrait that remains Steve McQueen\u2019s greatest film to date. All three will likewise be hanging around on All4 \u2013 essential catch-up fare if you\u2019ve never seen them. If you want to expand the mini-season on your own, meanwhile, the streaming universe has plenty of options \u2013 even if some keystone films of the Troubles are disappointingly hard to find online. (Paul Greengrass\u2019s Bloody Sunday and Pat O\u2019Connor\u2019s Cal are oddly awol, while Alan Clarke\u2019s brutal, seminal short Elephant can only be found chopped into four videos on Dailymotion \u2013 hardly the way it should be watched.) The BFI Player, however, reliably pitches in with Maeve, a remarkable, little-seen feminist angle on the era from 1981, following a young woman returning to Belfast after a long spell in London and defiantly asserting herself to her family and her republican lover. Pat Murphy\u2019s film puts a gendered spin on Anglo-Irish relations too: it remains spiky and thought-provoking. If you only associate Ken Loach with kitchen-sink realism, the jittery conspiracy-thriller mechanics of his 1990 film Hidden Agenda (available on iTunes) may surprise you. Starring Frances McDormand as an American lawyer on a mission to uncover the British government\u2019s crimes against the Northern Irish, it\u2019s one of his most overtly entertaining films \u2013 but still steams with righteous Loachian fury. Still underrated, meanwhile, is James Marsh\u2019s coolly empathetic Shadow Dancer (2012), available on Google Play, among other outlets, with its taut, fierce performance from Andrea Riseborough as a cagey IRA terrorist turned MI5 informant. Not everything under this thematic banner, however, has to be sobering or outright despairing \u2013 or even for adults. As a chaser to all that grit, Mickybo and Me (available on SkyStore) offers a gentle, sweet-natured growing-up portrait of two boys (one Catholic, one Protestant, mutually worshipful of Butch Cassidy) in 1970 Belfast, who dream of escaping their troubles in all senses and journeying to Australia. And over on Amazon, the rollicking musical biopic Good Vibrations \u2013 about record label founder Terri Hooley and the Belfast punk scene he cultivated amid social turmoil \u2013 is a lively reminder of the urgent art that emerges from rough times. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week Avengers: Endgame (Disney, 12) The comic-book colossus makes its way to home entertainment \u2013 and by this point, really, you\u2019re in or you\u2019re out. More a souped-up Comic-Con convention than a film, but it\u2019s done with confident bluster. Out of Blue (Spirit, 15) British indie auteur Carol Morley and the literature of Martin Amis seem an unlikely mix on paper. On watching this disconcertingly stateless New Orleans noir with metaphysical overtones, they remain pretty unlikely on screen, but its spell works on some. Memory: The Origins of Alien (Dogwoof, 15) As in his Psycho-oriented 78/52, Swiss film-maker Alexandre O Phillippe maker brings a fresh, eerie energy to the standard \u201cmaking-of\u201d doc formula, this time probing the mythology, psychology and dreamy design of Ridley Scott\u2019s sci-fi classic. Shock Corridor/The Naked Kiss (Sony, E) Two of Samuel Fuller\u2019s most exhilarating, on-edge classics get the Criterion treatment, their buffed-up presentation accentuating just how expertly he walked the line between art and exploitation.",

They were noisy and antic. They slalomed through history, philosophy, imperial politics. They dramatised hybridity, interconnection and cultural convergence. They were populated by absurd, hysterical, grotesque characters. They seemed alive to the modern world. And now?

The imminent ninth season rocks up at a classic 1980s summer camp, where a bunch of innocent teens have gathered for what looks like an enthusiastic skewering of Friday the 13th-style slasher movies. In fact, the chopping started early, with some regular AHS cast members \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/19/billy-eichner-on-the-street-five-best\">Billy Eichner</a> and Evan Peters \u2013 skipping this season. <em>GV</em><strong><br></strong><em>Expected: 19 September, Fox</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54JoryNToJw\">Catherine the Great</a></strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54JoryNToJw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/54JoryNToJw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>You don\u2019t rule Russia for 34 years without doing some dirt. And, sure enough, Catherine the Great\u2019s story is tumultuous. As a woman who came to power in a coup in which her own husband was overthrown, Catherine didn\u2019t take any prisoners. And that extended to her unusually liberated private life, too; this drama explores her later years and particularly her affair with military leader Grigory Potemkin. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/03/helen-mirren-attacks-netflix-saying-there-is-nothing-like-sitting-in-the-cinema\">Helen Mirren</a> (who else?) portrays Catherine in her customarily magisterial style. <em>PH</em><strong><br></strong><em>Expected: Autumn, Sky Atlantic</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eshaM0emkeU\">Criminal</a></strong></h2> <p>Gone are the days when TV viewers longed for cop shows to cut to the chase.

Usually that\u2019s been an upending of the reality in which these characters swap brainy one-liners. In the fourth run, however, the twist is that this really is the end: creator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/how-we-made-parks-and-recreation-amy-poehler-nick-offerman-mike-schur\">Michael Schur </a>decided some time ago that somewhere around 50 episodes would be enough.

Tenderly observed as Tambor\u2019s portrayal of transgender matriarch Maura was, in the five years since Transparent debuted, the casting of a cis man has in any case looked more and more retrograde. No House of Cards-style collapse is likely here, then, as the show kills Maura off and puts its secret weapon, Judith Light, literally centre stage. Rendering the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4-io9Wqmds\">feature-length \u201cmovie\u201d finale</a> as a musical ought to create the perfect conduit for Transparent\u2019s ongoing obsessions: grief, trauma, Jewish culture, how those three interact, and how they affect the unhappy adults\u2019 endless search for identity. That the Pfefferman family are staging a show within a show, a theatrical production about themselves, rather than just breaking into song during their ordinary lives, will offer plenty of scope for ruthless introspection \u2013 another Transparent calling card. More straightforwardly, perhaps the current vogue for film musicals taps into a desire among audiences to sing our way through dark times.

      "bodyText": "American Horror Story 1984 Ryan Murphy\u2019s reliably wicked and impressively durable horror anthology has always bounced around different time periods in an attempt to keep things fresh. The imminent ninth season rocks up at a classic 1980s summer camp, where a bunch of innocent teens have gathered for what looks like an enthusiastic skewering of Friday the 13th-style slasher movies. In fact, the chopping started early, with some regular AHS cast members \u2013 Billy Eichner and Evan Peters \u2013 skipping this season. GV Expected: 19 September, Fox Catherine the Great You don\u2019t rule Russia for 34 years without doing some dirt. And, sure enough, Catherine the Great\u2019s story is tumultuous. As a woman who came to power in a coup in which her own husband was overthrown, Catherine didn\u2019t take any prisoners. And that extended to her unusually liberated private life, too; this drama explores her later years and particularly her affair with military leader Grigory Potemkin. Helen Mirren (who else?) portrays Catherine in her customarily magisterial style. PH Expected: Autumn, Sky Atlantic Criminal Gone are the days when TV viewers longed for cop shows to cut to the chase. Instead, Line of Duty has revealed a surprising appetite for head-spinningly intricate interrogation scenes. Criminal takes this trend to the next level: it contains literally nothing else. Set entirely within the confines of police interview rooms, the series nevertheless spans continents with stars including David Tennant, Hayley Atwell and Nina Hoss bringing agonisingly intense mental conflicts to life. PH Expected: 20 September, Netflix Defending the Guilty Since Peter Moffat\u2019s Silk ended five years ago, homegrown legal shows have been thin on the ground \u2013 making this new series something of a novelty. Best known for penning the Channel 4 dark comedy Flowers, Will Sharpe leads this courtroom comedy, playing a young barrister mentored by Katherine Parkinson\u2019s more hardened attorney. His character \u2013 also named Will \u2013 is an ingenue who, like many a grad before him, quickly becomes rather disillusioned with the world of work. HJD Expected: September, BBC Two Dublin Murders Ireland\u2019s past, present and future are drawn together in grim and gory style in this new thriller from Sarah Phelps. Set at the height of Ireland\u2019s millennial financial boom, the series adapts the first two of Tana French\u2019s novels into an eight-part saga that sees ambitious murder cops Rob Reilly and Cassie Maddox confronted with the apparently unconnected but notably macabre deaths of two young women. Killian Scott and Sarah Greene join the dots. PH Expected: Autumn, BBC One Giri/Haji It just wouldn\u2019t be autumn without an ambitious, cross-continental drama, and Giri/Haji promises to be just that. Set in Tokyo and London, this new eight-parter (whose name translates to Duty/Shame) follows a Japanese detective, Kenzo (played by Takehiro Hira), who travels halfway across the globe to London to search for his missing, estranged brother. With a cast from both countries, including Kelly Macdonald and Charlie Creed-Miles, and penned by Humans writer Joe Barton, expect a thriller that is as imaginative as it is international. HJD Expected: October, BBC Two Gold Digger From Mum to Wanderlust, the sub-genre of TV exploring the sexual and emotional lives of older people continues to grow. This Marnie Dickens drama is another worthy addition. After years of selfless domesticity, wealthy 60-year-old Julia begins a relationship with Benjamin, a skint copywriter 25 years her junior. Julia\u2019s family are suspicious about his motives but have secrets of their own. Do they really have her best interests at heart? Julia Ormond and Ben Barnes are the pan-generational lovers. PH Expected: Late autumn, BBC One His Dark Materials From steampunk airships hovering over an alternative-universe Oxford to physical manifestations of your soul in the surprisingly cute form of a daemon, this deluxe BBC/HBO adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s beloved trilogy of fantasy novels looks set to outclass the stalled 2007 movie version. It boasts a stacked cast \u2013 including Ruth Wilson, James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda \u2013 and is led by Logan\u2019s poised mini-Wolverine Dafne Keen as plucky heroine Lyra. GV Expected: October, BBC One Limetown The pod-to-TV boom (see also Dirty John, Homecoming, My Dad Wrote a Porno) continues with this adaptation of the fictive crime podcast, which tells the story of the disappearance of a group of people in a research facility in a small Tennessee town via the framing device of a public radio broadcast. With the pod drawing umpteen X-Files comparisons, there\u2019s likely to be more than a hint of Mulder and Scully to this Jessica Biel-starring 10-parter. HJD Expected: 16 October, Facebook Watch Living With Yourself Paul Rudd \u2013 the seemingly unageing star of everything from Clueless to Ant-Man \u2013 stars in this new series, playing not one but two roles, as his character, George, undergoes an experimental new treatment to become a better person. Overseen by the likes of Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, directors of 00s crowdpleaser Little Miss Sunshine, and written by former Daily Show writer Timothy Greenberg, expect it to land somewhere between Maniac and The Good Place. Aisling Bea \u2013 who recently wowed in Channel 4\u2019s This Way Up \u2013 also stars. HJD Expected: October, Netflix Motherland Anna Maxwell Martin \u2013 last seen giving Superintendent Hastings an almighty tongue-lashing in series five of Line of Duty \u2013 reprises her altogether different role in this wonderfully shambolic comedy: as a perpetually struggling middle-class mother shunned by the PTA and entirely unsupported by her husband. Happily, Diane Morgan also returns as the mellow, completely hands-off mum Liz, while Sherlock\u2019s Tanya Moodie joins the fold as Meg, who causes a stir at the school gates. HJD Expected: October, BBC Two On the Edge Another triptych of human stories from up-and-coming screenwriters, as Channel 4\u2019s acclaimed anthology series returns for a second run. This time the theme is people \u201ctrying to find their place in the world\u201d, encompassing Adulting \u2013 about a girl with learning difficulties who gets into a potentially dangerous friendship with a young man (This Is England\u2019s Michael Socha) \u2013 plus mental health-themed family dramedy For You, and BBW, a coming-of-age story about a young British-Nigerian woman. HJD Expected: Autumn, Channel 4 Pose Season two of Ryan Murphy\u2019s groundbreaking drama picks up two years on, with the HIV/Aids crisis ravaging New York City. Some \u2013 like House of Evangelista\u2019s Blanca (Mj Rodriguez) \u2013 choose activism; others \u2013 such as Elektra (Dominique Jackson) \u2013 choose escapism, and Pose is at its most magical when both elements combine in the ballroom. The early-90s was also when ball culture went pop, via Madonna\u2019s Vogue. But mainstream acceptance comes at what price? EEJ Expected: October, BBC Two Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! Can anything stop the Fab Five? The reboot of not especially old, not particularly lamented makeover show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy was perhaps the biggest surprise TV hit of \u2026 2018?! Yes, it was somehow only last year that Tan, Antoni and the rest first strode expertly on to Netflix, but with four seasons already released and a second trip abroad coming next, they\u2019ve rapidly become fixtures on the entertainment landscape \u2013 and in danger of over-saturation. The new foreign jaunt is also set to be a bigger test than sorting out buttoned-down men and weary women in the deep south or midwest of the US, or indeed the New South Wales farmer who was the focus of previous overseas adventure Yass, Australia! The four episodes in Japan will heighten the tension between worldviews that\u2019s always been a key part of the Queer Eye magic, bringing us the gang\u2019s first full-on culture clash. The Five themselves confidently claim that their normal mix of directness and tenderness has dissipated any thoughts of international insensitivity, with emotional pay-offs such as two old Japanese male friends breaking their deep-seated reluctance to hug forming a more intense version of the show\u2019s regular road to personal redemption. JS Expected: November, Netflix Ramy Launched to a glut of positive reviews in the US, this semi-autobiographical dramedy tells the story of \u2018Allah carte\u2019 Muslim Ramy (Ramy Youssef), a first generation Muslim-American working out how to balance his parents\u2019 culture and religion, and classic \u2018youth\u2019 vices of drink, drugs and sex. Like Atlanta, the best storylines here are the ones tinged with politics - among them a coming of age flashback set in the wake of 9/11. HJD Expected: out now, StarzPlay/Amazon Rhythm + Flow Everyone except Simon Cowell should be wildly excited about Cardi B\u2019s return to reality television. She first broke through as the \u201cshmoney\u201d-loving upstart in Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York and now she\u2019s a judge in this 10-part hip-hop talent search, alongside TI and Chance the Rapper. Netflix looks set to innovate the competition format in other respects, too \u2013 without live shows, how will the viewers vote? EEJ Expected: October, Netflix The Righteous Gemstones Danny McBride\u2019s latest HBO comedy promises to do for the large adult sons of US southern megachurches what Succession has done for transatlantic media heirs: that is, rip them to shreds for our viewing pleasure. McBride (Eastbound &amp; Down, Vice Principals) writes and stars, but he\u2019s far from the only colourful gemstone. John Goodman is stern patriarch Eli, while Walton Goggins sparkles as Christian rocker-turned-pulpit preacher Baby Billy Freeman. EEJ Expected: October, Sky Atlantic Rob Delaney Special In a belated effort to catch up with Netflix, Amazon spent August launching a raft of comedy specials showcasing standup talent from both the US and UK. Having also signed Rob Delaney \u2013 Catastrophe co-creator, mercurial tweeter and breakout star of Deadpool 2 \u2013 the megacorp streaming service cannily gets the best of both worlds: a bawdy but empathetic Yank who has lived long enough in London to be an astute observer of our sceptred isle. GV Expected: November, Amazon Prime Video RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK Start your engines, and may the best (British) woman or man win: the hotly anticipated UK version of the show that brought drag to the mainstream arrives on screens this autumn, with Ru, Michelle Visage, Graham Norton and Alan Carr joined by a range of guest judges, among them Lorraine Kelly and Geri Horner. And, of course, the 10 all-important queens, whose \u201ccharisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent\u201d will be put to the test. While there have been about 100 series of US Drag Race, this is a format that\u2019s still liable to put a smile on your face. HJD Expected: October, BBC Three Sorry for Your Loss Was it unexpected that one of 2018\u2019s most emotionally astute depictions of grief was put out by, um, Facebook? Yes, kind of, but we\u2019re moving on now in season two, just as Leigh (Elizabeth Olsen) is moving on from Matt\u2019s death with the help of her family (Kelly Marie Tran, Janet McTeer) and her dead husband\u2019s brother, Danny (Jovan Adepo). Perhaps a posthumously published comic book can help define Matt\u2019s legacy instead? EEJ Expected: 1 October, Facebook Watch State of the Union Hi, infidelity! Nick Hornby turns his hand to bite-size content with this new 10-part series about a long-term couple \u2013 Rosamund Pike and Chris O\u2019Dowd \u2013 who have hit a crisis point. Each 10-minute episode takes place in the pub as the two fortify themselves before their regular marriage therapy session, offering an evolving weekly snapshot of a relationship in freefall. Directed by Stephen Frears, it has already screened on Sundance TV to admiring reviews. GV Expected: 8 September, BBC Two Sticks and Stones The new three-parter from Doctor Foster writer Mike Bartlett stars relative newcomer Ken Nwosu as Reading-based middle manager Thomas Benson. After badly bungling a pitch meeting, Thomas is determined to win back the client but feels undermined by his team. Is someone really out to get him? And can Bartlett create the same paranoid intensity from workplace bullying as he did with a betrayal in the home? EEJ Expected: Late autumn, ITV Strictly Come Dancing The not-all-singing-but-definitely-all-dancing TV mainstay returns for a whopping 17th series. From the Strictly curse that sees partners cha cha cha away from their real-life spouses, to an often random mix of contestants (see Ed Balls, Ann Widdecombe, and, this year, someone named Viscountess Emma Weymouth), it\u2019s reliably repetitive. Even so, it\u2019s always rather fun, too \u2013 something that the likes of Made in Chelsea jester Jamie Laing, Radio 1 DJ Dev and Drag Race\u2019s Michelle Visage are likely to appreciate. HJD Expected: 7 September, BBC One Temple TV is full of troubled, rogue cops who don\u2019t play by the rules. But how about a rogue surgeon? This berserk new drama sees Mark Strong playing Daniel Milton, a medic whose desperation to find a cure for his wife\u2019s life-threatening illness leads him into a terrifying world of (literally) underground medicine. Beneath Temple station in London, he finds a network of illicit clinics offering dubious experimental treatments. But what might immersion in this dark realm cost him? PH Expected: 13 September, Sky One The Cockfields Weirdy-beardy panel show regular Joe Wilkinson co-writes (with David Earl) and stars in this new three-part sitcom set on the Isle of Wight, a relatively untapped comedic setting. He plays Simon, nervously preparing to celebrate his 40th birthday by taking his girlfriend Donna (Diane Morgan) back to his childhood home to meet his daffy mum (Sue Johnston) and overbearing stepdad (Bobby Ball), unaware that his biological father (Nigel Havers) is also keen to elbow in on the fun. GV Expected: November, Gold The Crown Like some ermine-clad superhero, this third season of Netflix\u2019s all-conquering royal drama sees Claire Foy\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II enter a palatial phone box and rematerialise as Olivia Colman. We\u2019ve reached the 60s \u2013 but will the decade swing for Liz and Phil (who has undergone a transformation of his own and is now portrayed by Tobias Menzies)? Expect moon landings, awkward interactions with pop culture and the arrival of Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret. PH Expected: 17 November, Netflix The End of the F***ing World Was James (Alex Lawther) actually killed by police shooters in the series one finale, leaving Alyssa (Jessica Barden) to face justice alone? That\u2019s how Charles Forsman\u2019s original graphic novel ended, but since this show about two runaway teen psychos is back for more 90s indie flick-inspired mayhem, we\u2019re guessing screenwriter Charlie Covell has made some changes. Now their dark dalliance can continue in these short-but not-too-sweet episodes. EEJ Expected: November, Channel 4 The Good Place Each season of America\u2019s cleverest sitcom has had a radical creative decision behind it. Usually that\u2019s been an upending of the reality in which these characters swap brainy one-liners. In the fourth run, however, the twist is that this really is the end: creator Michael Schur decided some time ago that somewhere around 50 episodes would be enough. A showrunner calmly calling time on their own project is a rare blessing in an era of brutal cancellations, caused by the disruptive arrival of streaming \u2013 as fans of The OA recently found out, Netflix is not the infinitely generous space it once seemed to be \u2013 and the subsequent backlash from traditional media companies setting up their own, exclusive online platforms. Artistically, it makes sense for The Good Place, too, since the genius of the series has always been its willingness to very nearly disappear up itself: it\u2019s avoided it, but every further metaphysical tangle is a gamble. Sticking the landing when your whole routine has been triple comic somersaults won\u2019t be easy. Schur\u2019s fans will trust him to do it, though \u2013 especially since, as the show has evolved, it\u2019s revolved more and more around an old-fashioned love triangle, the sort of set-up satisfying finales have always been made of. JS Expected: 27 September, Netflix The Light It is loosely the third and final part of a state-of-the-nation trilogy preceded by National Treasure and Kiri. But this Jack Thorne drama will also stand alone as a story of beleaguered community life in small-town Britain. After a controversial construction project goes tragically wrong, furious locals seek justice. Sarah Lancashire stars as Polly, a woman whose family is both implicated in the causes of the disaster and torn apart by its aftermath. PH Expected: Autumn, Channel 4 The Loudest Voice It might be hard work finding a hero to root for in this new drama, which stars an almost unrecognisable Russell Crowe as TV executive Roger Ailes. For the fortunately uninitiated, Ailes was a fake news-pioneering, hard-right provocateur who resigned from Fox News in 2016 after allegations of sexual harassment and was memorably described in Rolling Stone magazine as \u201cone of the worst Americans ever\u201d. Can Crowe humanise this self-consciously divisive figure? PH Expected: 5 September, 9pm, Sky Atlantic The Mandalorian Disney launch their streaming platform Disney+ with this flagship series, hoping the lure of a galaxy far, far away will be enough to convince punters to cough up for yet another monthly subscription (the app\u2019s UK release date is still TBC but with the US/Aus/NZ and Netherlands going live in November it\u2019s sure to be soon). The Force, at least, appears strong: it\u2019s helmed by Iron Man and Lion King director Jon Favreau, counts Pedro Pascal, UFC hardnut Gina Carano and Werner Herzog among its cast, and has a budget in the region of latter-season Game of Thrones. LH Expected: Late autumn, Disney+ The Politician Back to school for Ryan Murphy, who has most recently given us Pose but whose TV breakthrough came courtesy of the cheesily charming Glee. With shades of Reese Witherspoon\u2019s brilliantly grotesque turn in 1999 film Election, The Politician examines the darkly comical will to power of Payton Hobar (Ben Platt), an ambitious student whose lifelong dream of being US president must survive the savage politics of his high school. A starry cast also includes Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lange. PH Expected: 27 September, Netflix The Witcher In a grim, feudal realm of might and magic, brooding but hunky monster-hunter Geralt (Henry Cavill, rocking a killer white wig) roams the blighted landscape looking for trouble on his faithful nag Roach. Based on a series of best-selling Polish fantasy novels (and already adapted into a hugely successful video game franchise), The Witcher seems purposefully designed to scratch that Game of Thrones itch, promising down-and-dirty combat and even murkier politicking. GV Expected: December, Netflix Top Boy Perma-sad rapper and London fan Drake was the driving force behind this reboot of the cult black British drama starring former So Solid Crew man Ashley Walters and Kane Robinson, better known as grime veteran Kano. As it returns, Dushane (Walters) is back and ready to reclaim his place as the kingpin of the Summerhouse estate, but a host of newbies (played by the likes of up-and-comer Michael Ward, who appeared in Stormzy\u2019s Gang Signs and Prayer short, and rap heavyweight Dave) aren\u2019t going to make things easy for him or Sully (Robinson). HJD Expected: 13 September, Netflix Transparent The groundbreaking dramedy is well placed to deal with its enforced #MeToo casting change: even before his dismissal, Jeffrey Tambor had become less and less important in an ensemble piece with a bold, open-hearted diversity beyond its headline-grabbing title role. Tenderly observed as Tambor\u2019s portrayal of transgender matriarch Maura was, in the five years since Transparent debuted, the casting of a cis man has in any case looked more and more retrograde. No House of Cards-style collapse is likely here, then, as the show kills Maura off and puts its secret weapon, Judith Light, literally centre stage. Rendering the feature-length \u201cmovie\u201d finale as a musical ought to create the perfect conduit for Transparent\u2019s ongoing obsessions: grief, trauma, Jewish culture, how those three interact, and how they affect the unhappy adults\u2019 endless search for identity. That the Pfefferman family are staging a show within a show, a theatrical production about themselves, rather than just breaking into song during their ordinary lives, will offer plenty of scope for ruthless introspection \u2013 another Transparent calling card. More straightforwardly, perhaps the current vogue for film musicals taps into a desire among audiences to sing our way through dark times. We could find worse heroines in 2019 than Light as the viperish, brittle, defiant Shelly, a woman grabbing at life hard before it\u2019s too late. JS Expected: 27 September, Amazon Prime Video Undone Rotoscoping animation has been around for a while \u2013 remember Richard Linklater\u2019s A Scanner Darkly? \u2013 but this sci-fi series from the BoJack Horseman team is the first time the trippy technique has been used for episodic television. Undone\u2019s plot is equally mind-bending: a car accident leaves Alma (Rosa Salazar) with a new understanding of time, which she uses to find out the truth about her father, Jacob (Bob Odenkirk). EEJ Expected: 13 September, Amazon Prime Video Untouchable: The Rise and Fall of Harvey Weinstein He might not prove so untouchable after all but that is likely to be the only note of cheer in this meticulous and carefully sourced documentary. It traces Weinstein\u2019s rise, explores the ways in which he allegedly used his power to exploit and abuse dozens of women and tracks his downfall, too. With many of Weinstein\u2019s accusers speaking on camera for the first time, expect a harrowing anatomy of a modern scandal. PH Expected: 1 September, 9pm, BBC Two War of the Worlds The adaptation of HG Wells\u2019s sci-fi classic should finally arrive this autumn after multiple delays caused by problems with the show\u2019s CGI. This tale of alien invasion famously caused panic when it was first broadcast on the radio in 1938, and while this apparently faithful retelling of the story should be received more calmly, it\u2019s hard to tell at the moment. Rafe Spall, Eleanor Tomlinson and Robert Carlyle star. PH Expected: Autumn, BBC One Watchmen Rorschach\u2019s back! (Or at least his weird mask is.) After Zack Snyder\u2019s slavish 2009 movie version of the revered superhero-subverting comic by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, here comes a freestyle sequel overseen by Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof. Set three decades after the original story, it imagines an off-kilter alternative reality where vigilantes are outlawed and Robert Redford (played by, uh, Robert Redford) is the US president. What happens when masked avengers rise again? GV Expected: October, HBO World on Fire It wouldn\u2019t be autumn without a lavish BBC wartime epic. Written by Peter Bowker and starring Helen Hunt and Sean Bean, World on Fire is a nuanced people\u2019s history of the second world war, telling stories from all sides of the conflict. There\u2019s a Mancunian factory worker for whom the war opens up unimagined possibilities, an English translator trying to smuggle his Polish lover out of Warsaw, and a German family hiding their disabled daughter from the Nazis.

      "bodyText": "Tablet iPad mini \u2013 \u00a3399 Tablets can be a handy addition to any student\u2019s toolset, often lasting far longer on a charge than a computer or phone, with a big enough screen to get things done or catch up on the latest episode of The Expanse. Apple\u2019s recently updated 7.9in iPad Mini is my pick. It\u2019s the best part of \u00a3400, but strikes the right balance between power, screen and portability. Pair it with an Apple Pencil (\u00a389) for noting down diagrams, handwritten notes or just doodling. Plenty of apps cover almost anything you\u2019d want to do. Grab a case that covers the screen and the iPad Mini is fairly robust, which means it should survive trips in various backpacks just fine. There\u2019s a 4G version (\u00a3519) if you need data on the move, or the larger but lower-specced and cheaper 9.7in iPad (\u00a3319) is available if you want a bigger screen. The 10.5in iPad Air (\u00a3479) and 11in iPad Pro (\u00a3769) are also options if you want bigger screens and more power. Alternatives If you want your tablet to be more computer than giant smartphone, Microsoft\u2019s Surface Go runs full Windows 10, but is the size of an iPad. It starts at \u00a3379, but you\u2019ll want the \u00a3475 version with more storage, plus the \u00a399 keyboard case and maybe the \u00a399 Surface Pen. Amazon\u2019s Fire tablets (\u00a350 and up) are great value for watching videos and surfing the web, but as most students will have a smartphone for watching Netflix and YouTube, will be seen by some as an unnecessary extra purchase. Laptop Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 \u2013 \u00a3881 Nothing beats a good laptop if you need to get work done. Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop 2 is now a year old but offers the experience of a top-end laptop for less than \u00a31,000. It runs Windows 10, has a gorgeous 13.5in high density touchscreen, the brilliant Windows Hello facial recognition and battery life to consistently make it through a 12-hour work day. It has one of the best typing experiences available on any keyboard. It\u2019s a bit different too, with a smooth metal lid but fabric-covered deck. The port selection is a bit slim with no USB-C, but at least it has a full-sized USB and mini DisplayPort. Alternatives If you don\u2019t need a full PC, then Dell\u2019s \u00a3229 Chromebook 11 might do the job on the cheap. ChromeOS means it will perform well, with excellent browsing and web apps, but it won\u2019t run traditional desktop applications. Apple\u2019s new 13in MacBook Air is more expensive at \u00a31,099, but equally good, particularly if you have an iPhone or an iPad. It\u2019s slim, light, lasts about nine hours between charges and has two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports. Smartphone OnePlus 7 \u2013 \u00a3499 If you want one of the best phones you can buy for as little money as possible, that\u2019s the OnePlus 7. It has top-of-the-line performance yet lasts 34 hours between charges. The 6.41in OLED screen is great, with slim bezels around the edges meaning the phone isn\u2019t too enormous even though the screen is big. It runs a custom version of Android 9 Pie called OxygenOS, which is one of the best available. It even has the best in-screen fingerprint scanner available which matches the speed and accuracy of traditional sensors. Even the vibration haptics are great, as is the camera, even if it lacks optical zoom or an ultra-wide angle camera. It lacks wireless charging, and it only comes in mirror grey, but you can always put a case on it. Alternatives If you want something cheaper, the Xiaomi Mi A2 (\u00a3260) offers serious value with quality Android One software, a snappy experience and good screen. Apple users should consider the iPhone XR at \u00a3749, or cheaper if you have another iPhone to trade in. Long battery life and slightly cheaper price make the iPhone XR a winner. Note-taking apps Evernote \u2013 free Whatever you\u2019re studying, a good note-taking app is worth its weight in gold. Evernote is my all-time favourite: available on everything \u2013 be it your phone, tablet, laptop or in a browser. You can attach pretty much anything to a note, set reminders, record audio, handwrite notes, take camera snaps or, of course, type into a note. And practically everything syncs with Evernote too, so getting things into notes from other apps or services is a doddle. It\u2019s free, but there\u2019s a premium option for \u00a34.99 a month which allows you to search in pdfs and annotate them, and provides more storage for syncing notes. There\u2019s a student discount of 50% up for grabs, too. Alternatives Evernote\u2019s biggest rival is Microsoft\u2019s OneNote. Like Evernote, it\u2019s free to use, is available on practically everything and has better stylus support on Windows. If you don\u2019t get on with Evernote, try OneNote. Google\u2019s Keep is a lighter, simpler note keeper and integrated with the rest of the Google apps, which is fine for taking basic notes. Apple\u2019s Notes is included with iOS and MacOS and works well for note taking, but isn\u2019t available on Windows except through a browser. Gaming Nintendo Switch \u2013 \u00a3280 Everyone\u2019s a gamer now, and while a decent phone or tablet can play Fortnite, for social gaming there\u2019s one obvious choice: the Nintendo Switch. Slot the handheld into its dock connected to a TV and four of you can duke it out in Smash Bros Ultimate (\u00a348) or race in fan-favourite Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (\u00a341). But the Switch plays just as well handheld, with two built in controllers that can be slid off the side for impromptu two-player games in the pub, the coffee shop, in lectures, pretty much anywhere. It\u2019ll also play Fortnite and many single-player games, too. Nintendo recently released a slightly improved version of the Switch with longer battery life, so make sure you buy the new one, not the old one, if you can. (Look for the newer red box.) Alternative If the Switch isn\u2019t your jam, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One S (from \u00a3180) is arguably the next best thing for social gaming with access to a solid library of indie games and perennial favourites such as the Halo series, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Forza and others. There\u2019s an \u201call digital\u201d Xbox One S, but the version with the disc drive can play DVDs and Blu-rays, so that\u2019s worth it if the price is close.",

In Geneva this week, governments voted under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to regulate the international trade in both species of mako shark \u2013 long and short fin \u2013 in addition to 16 vulnerable species of sharks and rays. Mako sharks, the \u201ccheetahs of the ocean\u201d, can reach speeds of up to 43mph. They are overfished worldwide, but the shortfin mako is considered especially vulnerable in the North Atlantic.

Scientists and conservationists have been sounding the alarm over the important species. This year, the shortfin and longfin mako were classified as endangered and put on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u2019s red list.

Their ambitious plans were knocked off course by the mighty Cors Caron peat bog and the Cambrian mountains beyond. In the end, they succeeded merely in connecting Milford with Aberystwyth. The Ystwyth Trail follows the northern end of this sidetracked venture, which eventually closed in 1965. The creators of the cycle path have similarly been derailed at the southern end, where the trail is pushed off the track bed and on to roads from time to time. However, it still makes for a cracking ride: leaving the coastal resort of Aberystwyth, the path follows the banks of the Afon Ystwyth before dropping south along the Teifi to Tregaron. </p> <h2>High Peak Trail<strong>,</strong> Derbyshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"846a9415c44ca13260add5b1eb653d62f6e1fe9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/846a9415c44ca13260add5b1eb653d62f6e1fe9f/0_0_3600_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tandem on High Peak Trail nr Gotham, National Route 54\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Start/finish</strong> Dowlow Farm near Pomeroy/Cromford<br><strong>Distance</strong> 17 miles<br><strong>Getting there/away</strong> From Buxton railway station pick up NCN Route 68, which takes back roads to the start of the trail.

The upside is that the Forest Way is not just a cycle path on the former railway line but a designated linear country park. The green corridor runs through the High Weald area of outstanding natural beauty just north of the Ashdown Forest and provides an important habitat for wildlife. Leaving East Grinstead, the trail passes through the attractive villages of Forest Row, Hartfield and Withyham to arrive at the small town of Groombridge.

Tregaron is a bit in the wilds but if you hire your bike from Crys Melin Cycling (see below), after you\u2019ve dropped it off you can catch the 585 bus back to Aberystwyth Bike hire Crys Melyn Cycling has a free pick up/drop off service for the Ystwyth Trail so you can collect your bike or drop it off at Aberystwyth, Trawsgoed, Pontrhydygroes or Tregaron Potential stopovers Aberystwyth, Pontrhydfendigaid, Tregaron Top tips The 2019 Ceredigion Art Trail brings a host of artists and performers to the county until 5 September, or curate your own art trail around Aberystwyth by visiting ceredigionarttrail.org.uk In the 1860s, the dream of the owners of the Manchester and Milford Railway was to link the cotton mills of Lancashire with the port of Milford Haven. Their ambitious plans were knocked off course by the mighty Cors Caron peat bog and the Cambrian mountains beyond. In the end, they succeeded merely in connecting Milford with Aberystwyth. The Ystwyth Trail follows the northern end of this sidetracked venture, which eventually closed in 1965. The creators of the cycle path have similarly been derailed at the southern end, where the trail is pushed off the track bed and on to roads from time to time. However, it still makes for a cracking ride: leaving the coastal resort of Aberystwyth, the path follows the banks of the Afon Ystwyth before dropping south along the Teifi to Tregaron. High Peak Trail, Derbyshire Start/finish Dowlow Farm near Pomeroy/Cromford Distance 17 miles Getting there/away From Buxton railway station pick up NCN Route 68, which takes back roads to the start of the trail. The end is about a mile from Cromford station on the line between Derby and Matlock Bike hire There\u2019s a Bike &amp; Go membership scheme hub at Buxton station. The council-run Middleton Top Cycle Hire centre at Middleton by Wirksworth is near the southern end of the trail Potential stopovers Buxton, Wirksworth, Cromford and Matlock Top tips 2019 marks the 25th anniversary of the Wirksworth Festival (6-15 Sept), which will celebrate the work of around 150 artists In 1831, the Cromford and High Peak Railway carried its first minerals between the Cromford Canal and the Peak Forest Canal at Whaley Bridge. For such an unusual canal-to-canal line, it did well to survive until Beeching did for it in 1967. The trail it now hosts rises to 386 metres at Ladmanlow, affording great views over the White Peak area of the Peak District national park. Other highlights include the neolithic henge monument of Arbor Low and the picturesque market town of Wirksworth. Lanchester Valley Railway Path, Co Durham Start/finish Just west of Durham/Just south of Consett Distance 12 miles Getting there/away The start can be easily reached from Durham railway station on NCN Route 14. There are no stations close to the end, so the best course is either to buy a house in Consett or cycle back to Durham Bike hire None near the route Potential stopovers Durham, Lanchester and Consett Top tips There are excellent downloadable leaflets with maps and information on a whole stack of County Durham railway cycle paths at durham.gov.uk In 1862, the Lanchester Valley Railway began thrumming to the sound of locomotives hauling iron ore to the steelworks at Consett and coal from the mine at Langley Park. The last one chugged along the line around a century later, to be replaced by this scenic cycling route. Starting at Broompark, just outside Durham, the trail soon arrives at Bearpark\u2019s 13th-century Beaurepaire Priory. Lanchester provides not only a bustling market town with cafes and restaurants but also the remains of a Roman fort, Longovicium, which once guarded a major thoroughfare between York and Hadrian\u2019s Wall. The trail commands fantastic views over rural County Durham and the River Browney, and there\u2019s plenty for nature lovers, who can look out for roe deer, great butterfly orchids and, when winter comes, redwings and fieldfares. Near the trail\u2019s end there are also some startling sculptures of mammoth surveying instruments (pictured) to enjoy. Forest Way, West/East Sussex Start/finish East Grinstead/Groombridge Distance 11 miles Getting there/away There are railway stations at both ends of the trail Bike hire In East Grinstead at On Your Bike; Deers Leap at Saint Hill Green; in Forest Row via a community app-based scheme; and in Groombridge, Hartfield and Forest Row with Countrybike Potential stopovers East Grinstead, Forest Row, Groombridge Top tip Time your trip to coincide with the Forest Row Festival , with music, arts and workshops from 18 to 22 September When Richard Beeching axed most of the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells line in the 1960s, one of the villages affected was Forest Row, where the good doctor lived. Thenceforth, he and his fellow villagers would have to travel four miles to East Grinstead to catch a train. The upside is that the Forest Way is not just a cycle path on the former railway line but a designated linear country park. The green corridor runs through the High Weald area of outstanding natural beauty just north of the Ashdown Forest and provides an important habitat for wildlife. Leaving East Grinstead, the trail passes through the attractive villages of Forest Row, Hartfield and Withyham to arrive at the small town of Groombridge. The old line crosses a Roman road and passes close by Pooh Bridge (pictured) near Hartfield, where folk still play Poohsticks. Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Please do not mistake this for a plea of \u201cwoe is me, the life of a tortured artist is much harder than you might think\u201d: I am fully aware that I am lucky in the extreme, and I enjoy my job hugely. However, I was recently flicking through Facebook, hoping to distract myself, when I came across a story about Rick Moranis that does the rounds every so often. I say story; it\u2019s just the fact that, following the tragic death of his wife, he walked away from his stellar acting career and became a full-time dad. A few years ago, he explained that he had no regrets. Couple that with some stat I half remember from a recent conversation, that you spend over 60% of the time you are ever going to spend with your child before they are 10 and I have begun to freak out about work-life balance. I love my job, and I have laboured under the belief that I am doing what\u2019s right for my family; but the fact I do love it means I can\u2019t help questioning my motives. Going out to perform heart surgery feels noble, but \u201cDaddy has to go out and tell people his unformed thoughts about stuff\u201d doesn\u2019t feel quite as selfless. Every fourth tweet I receive is a joke about how I am always on TV; and last week my wife made a comment about how the house will be much calmer when I\u2019m back on the road, which suggests that I am away so often she has concluded I am detrimental to her life. So I have decided to take a step back. I am not going to do a Rick Moranis, as I think my constant presence could be damaging to the development of my children; but I am going to do other stuff for a bit. I am going to know what my kids\u2019 teachers are called, without hesitation. I am going to try to fool my wife into thinking I might be beneficial to the family. I am going to aim to be, just for once, the first parent the kids come to when they hurt themselves, ideally without having caused the accident myself. One of two things will happen. Next week, I might be writing about my happy and fulfilling new role as a \u201chouse husband\u201d, or about the marital issues caused by my increased presence at home. What is most likely is that I\u2019ll realise that I only made this decision because I was on holiday, and I\u2019ll get home and try to pretend it never happened. A bit like that time I came back from Faliraki thinking I looked good in a trilby.",

Insects are also being promoted as an alternative protein source for both humans and animals, with the British brand Yora making pellets out of grubs that it says is an easy way to reduce your dog\u2019s \u201cglobal pawprint\u201d. The main ingredient in Wild Earth\u2019s dog food is a yeast protein \u2013 which goes on sale in the UK next year \u2013 billed as having the \u201cumami [savoury] taste that dogs love\u201d. The company\u2019s chief executive, Ryan Bethencourt, said the yeast provides \u201call the nutritional benefits of meat without the negative impact on the environment\u201d. The grubs used by Yora are the larvae of black soldier flies, which the firm describes as \u201ceasier to digest than chicken.\u201d The packaging promises it is made from \u201c100% whole grubs rather than the animal parts you might find in some dog foods\u201d. A teaspoon of eggs produces 100kg of grubs in two weeks. Will Bisset, Yora\u2019s head of innovation, said: \u201cInsects use a fraction of the resources to farm and our grubs are packed with essential amino acids and minerals to benefit pets..\u201d Some cat and dog owners like to buy the same products for their animals as they do for themselves, which has created a booming market in everything from CBD (cannabidiol) dog treats \u2013 unauthorised in the UK where no such products have been granted veterinary marketing approval \u2013 to canine health trackers. Hownd \u2013 a British brand that has made its name selling ethical canine spa products and vegetarian hemp treats \u2013 is currently crowdfunding to develop its own Wild Earth-style dog food after growing at more than 20% for the last three years. \u201cWe are seeing a growing interest in vegan/vegetarian diets for dogs,\u201d said Hownd\u2019s sales director, Mark Hirschel. \u201cIt\u2019s early days \u2026 but more companies are getting involved. Consumers have become far more ethically and environmentally aware, and understand the issues surrounding the use of animal ingredients, which include contamination, cruelty, and increased carbon footprint, among many others. \u201cDogs are omnivores, not carnivores, and therefore can digest protein from multiple sources. There is a growing list of plant-based proteins already available that are every bit as nutritious as meat protein, and contain fewer calories and potentially harmful effects than animal products.\u201d A 2018 survey by the research firm Mintel found that 41% of pet owners were interested in buying plant-based pet food. Among under-35s, that figure rose to 47%. But this alternative market is held back by price, with shoppers complaining that vegan dog food costs much more than meat-based equivalents. Caroline Baranger, a dog walker based in Ashford, Middlesex who rears her rescue dogs Mimo and Lyra on a vegan diet, said the plant-based brands she had bought in the past were too expensive and she now prepared their meals herself. She said: \u201cIt needs to be more affordable. They are seen as posh products because for many people the cost is problematic, as it asks you to triple your bill.\u201d Pets at Home, the UK\u2019s biggest pet care retailer, with 452 stores, stocks only a limited range of plant-based products, and the retailer\u2019s chief executive, Peter Pritchard, is uncertain about whether vegan dog food will become mainstream. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen many new pet foods and approaches come into this market over the years and they are often very fringe and based on beliefs rather than the cold, hard facts of what pets need to survive and thrive.\u201d The British Veterinary Association (BVA) said cats \u2013 which are obligate carnivores \u2013 should not be put on a vegetarian or vegan diet, but said it was \u201ctheoretically possible\u201d for dogs to become vegetarians. Daniella Dos Santos, the BVA\u2019s junior vice-president, said: \u201cAlthough we would not recommend it, it is theoretically possible to feed a dog a vegetarian diet, but owners would need to take expert advice to avoid dietary deficiencies and associated disease. A dog on a vegan diet may also need synthetic supplementation.\u201d The taste test \ud83d\udc36 Jack russell crosses Paddy and Fig tried out some vegetarian and insect-based dog food and a more traditional meat-based gravy bone. They were offered: Yora insect protein kibble (pellets), \u00a313.99 for 1.5kg Lily\u2019s Kitchen bedtime biscuits with honey, yoghurt, chamomile and Passion flowers, \u00a32.99 for 100g Pedigree gravy bones original \u00a31.72 for 400g box Paddy: According to his owner, Sophie More, three-year old Paddy (who has had a piece of rubber surgically removed from his stomach and is partial to nail clippings and dead toads) is a four-legged dustbin, so was unlikely to turn his nose up at any grub \u2013 even if made from grubs. The insect kibble did not touch the sides. Straight down the hatch, tail wagging furiously and then his big brown eyes looked up for more. Ditto the \u201cblissful bedtime biscuits\u201d. He didn\u2019t eat them so much as inhale the treats, so missed the chamomile and passion flower notes, but was found snoozing deeply later that afternoon. The gravy bone was a big hit too. Demolished by Paddy \u2013 clearly a flexitarian \u2013 in short order. Fig: Adaline Fahey says her dog is a keen carnivore with a taste for bone marrow. The insect kibble met with a lot of suspicion from eight year-old Fig. The treats were lined up in a row, and after much sniffing, she opted for the gravy bone. With the meaty bone out of the picture, Fig resumed the sniff test but rejected the calming biscuits and pushed the kibble away with her nose. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 September 2019 to make clear that CBD (cannabidiol) dog treats are not authorised for sale in Britain.",

      "bodyText": "Gary Mabbutt, the former Tottenham Hotspur club captain and England player, looked thoughtful. \u201cA Spurs player with a name starting with Q? Barbara, can you think of anyone?\u201d Barbara Greensmith hesitated, her arms and legs convulsing under the table. Mabbutt turned to Hirok Moitra, sitting on his other side. \u201cHirok, any ideas?\u201d Moitra sat expressionless and immobile, staring into the middle distance. There was a long silence. Then Moitra suddenly announced, \u201cAndy Quy.\u201d Moitra\u2019s daughter, Rebecca, gasped with surprise: \u201cHe can\u2019t necessarily remember what happened last week but that\u2019s a memory from two decades ago.\u201d She beamed with pride: \u201cWell done, dad!\u201d It is moments like these that make the dementia workshop held by the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation, the football club\u2019s charitable arm, in partnership with Sporting Memories Foundation, worthwhile for all involved. \u201cMy parents were both diagnosed with dementia,\u201d Mabbutt said later. \u201cThe club does so much work with youngsters but people are getting older and it\u2019s our responsibility to help them too. \u201cI know from my personal experience how important it is to keep the brains alert of those living with dementia,\u201d he said. \u201cSport is so important to so many people and can trigger all sorts of memories. It can bring the generations together too.\u201d There is now widespread agreement that the beautiful game can be good for one\u2019s mind as well as one\u2019s body. \u201cFor people in old age and dealing with dementia, rewatching matches can rekindle past memories, connect people with their past and keep the brain active,\u201d said NHS England\u2019s clinical director for dementia, Alistair Burns. \u201cThe power of sport can stimulate emotion which can be revived many years after the event,\u201d he added. \u201cEmotional memory, which is one of two main types of memory in the human brain, can be more powerful than memory for personal events, so as people in later life relive exciting or tense moments, this can stimulate memories, potentially strengthening brain activity.\u201d Amanda White, the London coordinator of the Sporting Memories Foundation, agreed: \u201cPeople who can\u2019t remember what they did yesterday will suddenly remember the first football match they were taken to, then they\u2019ll remember something else about their parents. Or they\u2019ll remember taking their own children to a match for the first time, and that will trigger another memory,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only great for them but for their families too, who can reconnect with their parent through these memories and enthusiasms.\u201d At the Spurs event in Percy House, the home of the club\u2019s foundation in north London, Barbara and Hirok pore over a table of Spurs memorabilia, including the FA Cup Spurs won in 1991 under Mabbutt\u2019s captaincy, old books and original football cartoons. Mabbutt has also brought along two football shirts, one worn by him in the first match in South Africa at which black players were allowed to wear their country\u2019s shirt. This triggers a short conversation about racism and politics. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what comes out of these football-themed games and discussions,\u201d said White. \u201cOne workshop led to a discussion about the suffragette movement because the conversation moved from football to horse racing to Emily Davison.\u201d Sporting Memories works with clubs across the UK.

Some recent high street clothing shrinks in the wash. The size on the label is only a guide. Choose hard-wearing fabrics Denim and leather are always better secondhand, particularly jackets. The fabric and cut often improve with age, and there will be a range of styles, not just the one or two shapes that the high street has this season. Be open-minded There are some trends you cannot find on the high street \u2013 such as men\u2019s leopard print. Seek out old floral dresses: the prints are so much more unique than whatever is on the high street. Shoes and belts Soft leather court shoes or boots that have been worn in are a find. If they have made it to a secondhand shop, and they are 20 years old already, you know they are good quality. Belts are brilliant and often available in more sizes than you would find on the high street. Look for natural fibres and genuinely old items Always be on the lookout for old labels, such as Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s St Michael or John Lewis\u2019s Jonelle, so that you know that items are genuinely old and will probably be well made. Also look for natural fibres \u2013 labels that say 100% wool, cashmere silk or wool. By Melanie Wilkinson and Helen Seamons",

Given 10 minutes to pack, they were bundled into separate cars and driven to Gladstone airport and flown to Melbourne, 1,500km away. They have not known a day\u2019s freedom since. Their ongoing case \u2013 and their dramatic reprieve from deportation in the early hours of Friday morning \u2013 has consistently raised concerns about Australia\u2019s onshore processing of refugee claims, over delays and care in the system, and of moral obligation to children born in this country to asylum seeking parents. On Thursday, the family was on board a Skytraders jet, privately chartered by the Australian government to Colombo, when a late-night court injunction in the family\u2019s favour saw the plane land at Darwin, and the family disembarked. They have since been moved \u2013 in the middle of the night Friday \u2013 to Christmas Island. The court injunction \u2013 now only applying only to the youngest daughter \u2013 has been extended to Wednesday at 4pm. A sprawling community and online social movement, under the banner of #hometobilo, has spanned the country, and united such unlikely political bedfellows as Alan Jones and Kristina Keneally. Supporters of the family have held vigils outside courthouses, protested at airports and offices of airlines, and blocked politicians\u2019 offices with sit-ins and inundated their staff with phone calls. But the chances of government intervention appear slim. Multiple sources have indicated to the Guardian that the immigration minister, David Coleman, is inclined \u2013 one source said \u201ccommitted\u201d \u2013 towards allowing the family to stay, but that he has been consistently overruled by the senior minister in the department, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who is adamant the family has extinguished its appeal avenues and must, by law, leave the country. A spokeswoman for Minister Coleman said this was not correct. The court will decide on Wednesday. The argument before the federal court is that no assessment has been made of youngest daughter Tharunicaa\u2019s claim for protection, and that her best interests have not been considered. Nadesalingam arrived in Australia by boat in 2012, having fled a post-civil war Sri Lanka still wracked by communal violence and repression of the Tamil minority.

After four years in Biloela, the family had become integral parts of the community. Nadesalingam worked at the town\u2019s meatworks and volunteered at St Vincent de Paul. Neighbours said Nadesh \u2013 as he was known \u2013 helped them with home renovations, while Priya and the children were active in community and daycare groups. Priya regularly made curries for staff at the local hospital. While they built a life, and a community in Australia, their cases continued through Australia\u2019s refugee status determination process. They were rejected for protection at every stage.

She said she had been told she would be receiving a new visa by mail from the department. Instead of mail, it was ABF officers who appeared at their house at 5am the next morning. Held in Melbourne for nearly a year-and-a-half, the family has had a deeply traumatic time in detention. The family has spent months in isolated rooms without access to outside or other people. Medical reports have shown both girls have suffered severe vitamin deficiencies, as well as behavioural and other medical issues. Tharunicaa has suffered painful infections in her teeth which have been inadequately treated, with delays in getting appointments, and a failure to provide medication. Victorian children\u2019s commissioner, Liana Buchanan, said Tharunicaa\u2019s was a \u201cdistressing case\u201d, and her lack of adequate care \u201chard to fathom\u201d.

With the flight in-air, a last-ditch legal injunction was sought \u2013 and ultimately granted \u2013 in the federal court. The plane was landed in Darwin, and the family taken from the airport to guarded accommodation. On Friday afternoon, the family was returned to Darwin airport and sequestered away from members of the general public. In scenes reminiscent of the war-scarred country they fled, the family was driven to the airport in a white van \u2013 notoriously, the vehicles used to \u201cdisappear\u201d people in Sri Lanka \u2013 and held incommunicado, without access to phones or outside help. With speculation the family had been flown back to Melbourne, or separated, with some members deported, for several hours, the family\u2019s friends, legal counsel and supporters found themselves in the extraordinary situation of not knowing where any of the family were. On Friday, the family was able to make contact with friends, telling them they were being held in Darwin.

Dutton said on Friday the family were not refugees and they had no legal right to stay in Australia. \u201cI would like the family to accept that they are not refugees, they\u2019re not owed protection by our country,\u201d the home affairs minister told Nine\u2019s Today program on Friday. He said the couple was told before they had children that they would never be allowed to settle in Australia, and no court or tribunal had ever supported their case to stay. \u201cThey came here by boat and we\u2019ve been very clear that they wouldn\u2019t stay.\u201d Australia is bound by international law to consider the best interests of the children in its decision-making, and family unity is a fundamental principle in international and Australian domestic law.

It is also a party to the international covenant on civil and political rights, which says the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state. Advocates for the family say it is within the government\u2019s bailiwick to grant freedom to the family, given their exceptional circumstances, and the fact the children know no life other than Australia. \u201cMinister Dutton, should he wish, can secure the future of this young family with the stroke of a pen,\u201d Tim O\u2019Connor from Amnesty International told the Guardian. \u201cThe extraordinary powers Minister Dutton has secured in his position as home affairs minister and as the senior minister in the department, include the powers of ministerial intervention, which specifically stipulate exceptional circumstances, including compassionate circumstances, which in our clear view, the situation of these two young girls and their family meets.\u201d Friends in Biloela want their neighbours back. \u201cIn the 24 hours since they were served the deportation notice, the emotional swing that has occurred in this community has been extraordinary,\u201d friend Angela Fredericks told the Guardian from Biloela, \u201cfrom the extreme despair and grief of last night to the rage today.

      "bodyText": "A Tamil asylum seeker family has been moved to Christmas Island after being given a reprieve against deportation from Australia until Wednesday. Supporters said they lost contact with the family on Friday night, and learned just after 2am that they had arrived at a detention centre on the island, north-west of Australia. In a statement the Home to Bilo group said the family\u2019s solicitor, Carina Ford, had been notified of the move in a notice received from the immigration department during the night. Priya, her husband Nadesalingam and their Australian-born children Kopika, 4, and Tharunicaa, 2, had been held at a Darwin military base. Priya was able to make contact with family and friends when they arrived at Christmas Island. \u201cMy children have been separated from their world,\u201d she said. The move comes after a judge issued a last-minute injunction to halt their deportation from Melbourne to Sri Lanka on Thursday night. The family landed in Darwin after the order was made and were taken off the plane. On Friday, there was another glimmer of hope. A Melbourne court ordered the government not to expel the youngest child until a further hearing on Wednesday. The family\u2019s legal team say only Tharunicaa is protected under the ruling because her claims for asylum protections have never been assessed. The rest of her family could be expelled as their legal avenues have been exhausted but Ford said Australia would be condemned if it split up the family. The Guardian understands the government has given a commitment not to separate family members. The family has been held in immigration detention since March of last year when ABF officers raided their home in Biloela at dawn, the morning after Priya\u2019s bridging visa expired. She still had legal avenues of appeal open to her at that point. Doctors and Victoria\u2019s commissioner for children and young people \u2013 the family has been held in detention in Melbourne \u2013 have warned that the prolonged detention and uncertainty has harmed the health of the children. Despite mounting community pressure, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, is refusing to grant the family permission to stay. \u201cI would like the family to accept that they are not refugees, they\u2019re not owed protection by our country,\u201d he told the Nine Network on Friday. Dutton said the deportation had been years in the making and should surprise no one, least of all the couple who had been warned prior to having children that they would not be allowed to stay. Friends in Biloela say the town has swung from grief and despair when the family was issued their deportation notice on Thursday, to anger at what they see as an unjust failure to consider the family\u2019s circumstance, and the contribution they have made to their community in Biloela. Family friend and advocate Angela Fredericks said she hoped the government might reconsider its position before the next court date Wednesday. \u201cWe implore them to do some soul-searching.

      "bodyText": "The Queensland government has extinguished native title over 1,385 hectares of Wangan and Jagalingou country for the proposed Adani coalmine in Queensland\u2019s Galilee Basin - without any public announcement of the decision. The decision could see Wangan and Jagalingou protesters forcibly removed by police from their traditional lands, including lands used for ceremonies. W&amp;J Council leader Adrian Burragubba, and a group of Wangan and Jagalingou representatives, had been calling on the government to rule out transferring their land, arguing they had never given their consent for Adani to occupy their country. In a meeting with government officials Friday, seeking a halt on leases being issued for mine infrastructure, they learned the state government had instead granted Adani exclusive possession freehold title over large swathes of their lands on Thursday, including the area currently occupied for ceremonial purposes. \u201cWe have been made trespassers on our own country,\u201d Burragubba said. \u201cOur ceremonial grounds, in place for a time of mourning for our lands as Adani begins its destructive processes, are now controlled by billionaire miner Adani. \u201cWith insider knowledge that the deal was already done, Adani had engaged Queensland police and threatened us with trespass.\u201d To mine any land under a native title claim, a miner needs an Indigenous land use agreement, essentially a contract that allows the state to extinguish native title. Adani has a ILUA over the land: five of the 12 native claimants have opposed it, but have lost successive legal challenges in court to prevent it. Seven, a majority, of the native title claimants support the Adani mine. Burragubba and a group of supporters set up camp on the land ahead of its legal transfer to Adani. He said they will refuse to leave. He said a notice received by the council said their country \u201cis to be handed over to Adani on 3 August 2019\u201d. The notice also says \u201cAdani will request the assistance of police to remove Mr Burragubba and his supporters from the camp\u201d. Burragubba, whom Adani has bankrupted over costs from legal challenges, said his group would not abandon their protest nor quit their lands. \u201cWe will never consent to these decisions and will maintain our defence of country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be on our homelands to care for our lands and waters, hold ceremonies and uphold the ancient, abiding law of the land.\u201d In a statement, Adani said it had worked closely with the traditional owners of the proposed mine\u2019s site since 2011 \u201cto ensure the customs and wishes of Indigenous people are respected and supported\u201d. Adani has secured four separate ILUA\u2019s with four traditional owner groups, including the Wangan and Jagalingou people. \u201cThe ILUA vote for the Wangan and Jagalingou people held in 2016 saw 294 people vote in favour of the Carmichael project proceeding and one vote against,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAdrian Burragubba has taken numerous legal actions against the Carmichael project and the courts have repeatedly said he has no case.\u201d Burragubba lost his final appeal in August. Australian governments will give $4.4bn in effective subsidies to Adani\u2019s Carmichael coal project, which would otherwise be \u201cunbankable and unviable\u201d, new analysis reported this week has found. The Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis concluded that the project would benefit from several Australian taxpayer-funded arrangements \u2013 including subsidies, favourable deals and tax concessions \u2013 over its 30-year project life. It said the project would be further supported by public handouts, tax breaks and special treatment provided to Adani Power, the proposed end-user of the thermal coal in India. \u201cIf these subsidies were not being provided, Adani\u2019s Carmichael thermal coalmine would be unbankable and unviable,\u201d the IEEFA report said. In a detailed statement in reply, Adani said the institute was \u201cknown for publishing alarmist papers that attempt to discredit the fossil fuel industry\u201d and said the report \u201cattempts to resurrect old and patently false and inaccurate claims suggesting the Carmichael project will only be viable because of a variety of government subsidies\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Did Saturdays even exist before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date\" title=\"\">the Blind </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date\" title=\"\">date column</a>? Not as far as I\u2019m concerned. The start of the weekend was a joyless desert until, in 2009, Weekend magazine started sending two hapless (my words) strangers out for dinner in the hope that three courses, a bottle of house white and the terror of appearing in a national newspaper would be the accelerant a romantic spark needs to go full inferno.</p> <p>I have been obsessed with Blind date for most of its 10-year existence. Its simplicity is deceptive: what the daters say leaves plenty of room for interpretation. On the surface, the questions are formulaic \u2013 somewhere between inane smalltalk at a stranger\u2019s house party and the sexless interrogation of a dietary questionnaire from your GP. But in the context of the column, they are traps \u2013 and I love to see the participants fall right in, revealing themselves via the short aside that they shared a pudding with their date. And let\u2019s not forget that score out of 10. Brutal to have adults rate one another, you might say. Delicious, I say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&amp;number=542&amp;title=Blind%20dates%20since%20the%20column%20began\" data-alt=\"Number of Blind dates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&number=542&title=Blind%20dates%20since%20the%20column%20began\">Number of Blind dates</a> </figure>  <p>The key to its success? It\u2019s relatable. I used to write an anonymous dating blog as <a href=\"https://theguyliner.com/about/\" title=\"\">The Guyliner</a>. I know what it\u2019s like out there. I have sat at deathly dull dinners with the king of halitosis talking about his loft conversion. I have taken sneaky glances at my watch as a partied-out zombie talked me through his negroni-inspired accumulator hangover. I have also dropped clangers, watched my date\u2019s face plummet and realised that my half of the bill is no longer an investment in a bright future, but a tax on my stupidity.</p> <p>This is why I love Blind date so much. But its two slim columns in the middle of Weekend, barely 400 words a week, weren\u2019t enough for me. Every Saturday, I would dash to social media to debrief with other devotees. The disasters! The fairytale endings! Even the kind of \u201cmeh\u201d ones where two clean-shirts spent two hours saying, \u201cNo, after you\u201d over a dish of calamari \u2013 we discussed them all.</p> <p>In July 2014, after years of writing about my own dates, I was coupled up and looking for something new to write about. It occurred to me that it might be fun to look deeper into Blind date, to read between the lines. In the same way that the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/line-of-duty-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">episode recaps of Line </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/line-of-duty-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">Of Duty</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/game-of-thrones-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">Game Of Thrones</a> are must-reads for fans eager to dissect their favourite dramas, I wanted to put Blind date under the microscope. </p> <p>Thus my blog,<a href=\"https://theguyliner.com/category/impeccable/\" title=\"\"> Impeccable Table Manners</a>, was born, taking its name from the stock reply given by many daters to the \u201cGood table manners?\u201d question. The tone is light snark, with greater savagery deployed occasionally for some of the biggest shockers. I try not to get too personal; I\u2019m critiquing what people say, not who they are, and I invite dates to get in touch if they want to give their side of the story. To my surprise, the blog\u2019s popularity grew and grew. Soon, every Saturday morning, my Twitter mentions were full of people asking when the review was going up \u2013 sometimes as early as 7.30am. (Guys, it\u2019s Saturday.)</p> <p>The idea was to take the daters\u2019 answers and run with them. Sometimes, quite far. Almost every column inspires me in some way, and if I get speechless, well, there is always an animated gif of Joan Collins rolling her eyes close at hand. And while this bit is fun, every week the date throws up a deeper topic for me to chew on. I have touched on loneliness, snobbery, racism, misogyny, masculinity, poverty and kindness. An awkward answer about who gets to pour the wine can get me going on just about anything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Who%20dated%20whom%3F&amp;standfirst=&amp;number-1=426&amp;field-1=Men%20dating%20women&amp;number-2=101&amp;field-2=Men%20dating%20men&amp;number-3=15&amp;field-3=Women%20dating%20women&amp;number-4=&amp;field-4=&amp;number-5=&amp;field-5=&amp;number-6=&amp;field-6=&amp;number-7=&amp;field-7=&amp;number-8=&amp;field-8=\" data-alt=\"Who dated whom?\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&opinion-tint=false&title=Who%20dated%20whom%3F&standfirst=&number-1=426&field-1=Men%20dating%20women&number-2=101&field-2=Men%20dating%20men&number-3=15&field-3=Women%20dating%20women&number-4=&field-4=&number-5=&field-5=&number-6=&field-6=&number-7=&field-7=&number-8=&field-8=\">Who dated whom?</a> </figure>  <p>The blog has developed running gags of its own \u2013 my readers and I react very strongly to lateness (no!), negronis (yuck!), daters worrying they talked too much (you are on a date, hun; talking is the point), chopsticks (always a disaster), sharing food (no, thank you), people who say, \u201cI think my friends would be too much for them\u201d about their crew of magnolia acolytes and, of course, the dreaded \u201cimpeccable\u201d: find a new word (except don\u2019t, because I love it).</p> <p>There have been occupational hazards. One guy I reviewed is now my editor at GQ magazine (awkward). Another woman was halfway through doing my makeup for a photoshoot before mentioning she had had the Impeccable treatment (she still made me look good). And I have been stopped in the street on numerous occasions by daters and fans of both the Weekend column and Impeccable Table Manners. The cult of Blind date is bigger than you might think.</p> <p>They say you should never meet your heroes, but the completist in me wanted to find out exactly what goes on behind the scenes. Despite my readers\u2019 frequent frustrations at the \u201calgorithm\u201d that puts daters together, it is not a supercomputer that does the matching. Nina Trickey, Weekend\u2019s resident cupid, has been hooking up readers since 2012, curating the entire process: sifting the romantic hopefuls\u2019 applications, matching them, booking the restaurant and compiling their answers. She has the perfect credentials for the job: as a favour to her friend Anna, her predecessor as cupid, Nina appeared in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/07/blind-date-relationships\" title=\"\">Blind </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/07/blind-date-relationships\" title=\"\">date No 2</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Marks%20out%20of%2010%3F&amp;standfirst=&amp;number-1=&amp;field-1=&amp;number-2=48&amp;field-2=10%20out%20of%2010s&amp;number-3=5&amp;field-3=11%20out%20of%2010s&amp;number-4=6&amp;field-4=Couples%20rating%20each%20other%2010%2F10&amp;number-5=7.7&amp;field-5=Average%20score&amp;number-6=&amp;field-6=Average%20score&amp;number-7=&amp;field-7=&amp;number-8=&amp;field-8=\" data-alt=\"Marks out of 10?\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&opinion-tint=false&title=Marks%20out%20of%2010%3F&standfirst=&number-1=&field-1=&number-2=48&field-2=10%20out%20of%2010s&number-3=5&field-3=11%20out%20of%2010s&number-4=6&field-4=Couples%20rating%20each%20other%2010%2F10&number-5=7.7&field-5=Average%20score&number-6=&field-6=Average%20score&number-7=&field-7=&number-8=&field-8=\">Marks out of 10?</a> </figure>  <p>She got on OK with Niall, 26. They scored each other an 8, but when asked if she would meet him again, Nina replied: \u201cNot romantically. Also, he didn\u2019t compliment me and I did him (on his shirt),\u201d thus setting the tone for the hundreds of daters who would follow. </p> <p>You need the precision of a heart surgeon to play Blind date matchmaker. Nina admits it can be hard. \u201cI can\u2019t match someone 100% of the time on what they say in that first email,\u201d she says. \u201cSome give you loads of information, but with others it\u2019s just two lines. I have to get them in, see them for myself.\u201d Daters are invited to have their photograph taken before their date \u2013 individually, of course, or where\u2019s the surprise?</p> <p>Sometimes applicants are too similar; the column is always running short of straight men, older couples and people outside the M25. While there may seem to be a Blind date \u201ctype\u201d, anyone is welcome to take part and the goal is to make the column as diverse as possible.</p> <p>Is there ever a risk of being set up with someone who is merely available, rather than a decent match? Nina shakes her head emphatically. \u201cNo, there has to be something there.\u201d Some daters wait quite a while \u2013 up to a year. \u201cI do feel bad for unmatched people still sitting in my inbox, but I never forget them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The meal is on the restaurant, in return for the honour of being featured; daters get three courses and one bottle of wine. Regular readers often bemoan dates that happen on a \u201cschool night\u201d, which often prevents anyone getting too hot under the collar, but this is partly dictated by daters\u2019 schedules and the restaurant\u2019s availability. Even once the date is under way, there are fires to fight. A restaurant once accidentally offered the daters a very expensive tasting menu that they then asked the couple to pay for; on occasion, couples have twisted the rules when it comes to the free wine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=And%E2%80%A6%20did%20you%20kiss%3F&amp;standfirst=&amp;number-1=48&amp;field-1=Number%20of%20kisses&amp;number-2=4&amp;field-2=Weddings%20(one%20this%20winter)&amp;number-3=4&amp;field-3=Number%20of%20babies&amp;number-4=&amp;field-4=&amp;number-5=&amp;field-5=Fernando%20Llorente%2C%20Dele%20Alli%2C%20Erik%20Lamela&amp;number-6=&amp;field-6=&amp;number-7=&amp;field-7=&amp;number-8=&amp;field-8=\" data-alt=\"And\u2026 did you kiss?\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&opinion-tint=false&title=And%E2%80%A6%20did%20you%20kiss%3F&standfirst=&number-1=48&field-1=Number%20of%20kisses&number-2=4&field-2=Weddings%20(one%20this%20winter)&number-3=4&field-3=Number%20of%20babies&number-4=&field-4=&number-5=&field-5=Fernando%20Llorente%2C%20Dele%20Alli%2C%20Erik%20Lamela&number-6=&field-6=&number-7=&field-7=&number-8=&field-8=\">And\u2026 did you kiss?</a> </figure>  <p>No-shows are rare, although one poor guy seemed to have the worst luck. \u201cHis first date stood him up, so I set him up again,\u201d Nina says. \u201cThe second girl was a bit flakey and wouldn\u2019t commit to a date.\u201d So she took one for the team. Nina laughs: \u201cWell, I was single at the time\u2026 I asked him out myself.\u201d It didn\u2019t last, and Nina is now spoken for, but she has been asked out by potential matches more than a few times.</p> <p>Once the date is done, Nina sends out a questionnaire. The answer she looks forward to seeing the most? \u201cThe kiss, obviously! Just to see if I was right to match them \u2013 we do want people to get on. But I also like \u2018Will you meet again?\u2019\u201d The editors have been known to cheer when news of a good date reaches the office.</p> <p>Since the column began in 2009, 542 couples have judged each other\u2019s table manners. The first \u201cImpeccable!\u201d came early, in the very first date, while the first score of 10 came two months later \u2013 although it was not reciprocated. In fact, we waited almost five years for the first double 10, from students <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/21/blind-date-josh-bradlow-biko-benitez-thomas\" title=\"\">Josh and Biko</a>, who answered \u201cDid you go on somewhere?\u201d with a baffling trip to M&amp;M\u2019s World in London. But to my mind, the first truly emphatic 10 \u2013 one of them even gave a bonus point for \u201ctaste in films\u201d \u2013 came from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/27/blind-date-lizzie-tomas\" title=\"\">Lizzie and Tomas in May 2017</a>, who are getting married later this year. And yes, Nina and I are invited and will be making sure they don\u2019t share their main course.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest Blind date of all, published in January this year, belonged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/12/blind-date-joanne-morgan\" title=\"\">Joanne and Morgan</a>. This raucous duo really went for it \u2013 sinking endless bottles of wine, snogging ferociously, gatecrashing a party and, upon being ejected, discovering one of them had left their knickers behind. The encounter went viral; the next day, Joanne was on BBC Radio 5 Live explaining herself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/tale-of-the-tape/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;title-a=High%20score&amp;description-a=&amp;image-a=&amp;colour-a=Purple&amp;title-b=Low%20score&amp;description-b=&amp;image-b=&amp;colour-b=Brown&amp;row-1-label=Describe%20in%20three%20words%3A%20the%20word%20that%20most%20often%20led%20to%20a%20high%20or%20low%20score&amp;row-1-value-a=Gorgeous&amp;row-1-value-b=Focused&amp;row-2-label=And%20the%20runners%20up%20%20%E2%80%A6&amp;row-2-value-a=Caring&amp;row-2-value-b=Self-assured&amp;row-3-label=%E2%80%94&amp;row-3-value-a=Good-looking&amp;row-3-value-b=Pleasant&amp;row-4-label=%E2%80%94&amp;row-4-value-a=Chilled&amp;row-4-value-b=Upbeat&amp;row-5-label=%E2%80%94&amp;row-5-value-a=Clever&amp;row-5-value-b=Outdoorsy&amp;row-6-label=&amp;row-6-value-a=&amp;row-6-value-b=&amp;row-7-label=&amp;row-7-value-a=&amp;row-7-value-b=&amp;row-8-label=&amp;row-8-value-a=&amp;row-8-value-b=&amp;source=\" data-alt=\"Describe in three words \u2026 words leading to high or low score\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/tale-of-the-tape/index.html?opinion-tint=false&title-a=High%20score&description-a=&image-a=&colour-a=Purple&title-b=Low%20score&description-b=&image-b=&colour-b=Brown&row-1-label=Describe%20in%20three%20words%3A%20the%20word%20that%20most%20often%20led%20to%20a%20high%20or%20low%20score&row-1-value-a=Gorgeous&row-1-value-b=Focused&row-2-label=And%20the%20runners%20up%20%20%E2%80%A6&row-2-value-a=Caring&row-2-value-b=Self-assured&row-3-label=%E2%80%94&row-3-value-a=Good-looking&row-3-value-b=Pleasant&row-4-label=%E2%80%94&row-4-value-a=Chilled&row-4-value-b=Upbeat&row-5-label=%E2%80%94&row-5-value-a=Clever&row-5-value-b=Outdoorsy&row-6-label=&row-6-value-a=&row-6-value-b=&row-7-label=&row-7-value-a=&row-7-value-b=&row-8-label=&row-8-value-a=&row-8-value-b=&source=\">Describe in three words \u2026 words leading to high or low score</a> </figure>  <p>But before anyone loses their underwear, lovers must be matched. Nina\u2019s cupid powers come into play at the photoshoot, where participants are photographed before their night out. It\u2019s a tightly run production line, as I found when I joined her last month. Daters are escorted from the Guardian\u2019s reception to a small studio and given 15 to 20 minutes to make the magic happen. Nina attends all the shoots, asking questions as she watches, her mind a Rolodex of potential matches. \u201cYou\u2019ll see for yourself,\u201d she says, as we wait for the first person to arrive. \u201cSometimes, something just clicks. But yes, there\u2019s also a spreadsheet.\u201d</p> <p>Without exception, each of tonight\u2019s six daters appears shellshocked. Suddenly, this becomes very real. Today\u2019s photographer is the Guardian staffer Linda Nylind, who tells me she loves guessing how people will get on. Our first dater, a guy in his early 20s, is a natural and keen on doing a James Bond pose. More nervous individuals have to be encouraged out of their shell, perhaps surprising in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/14/how-selfies-became-a-global-phenomenon\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/14/how-selfies-became-a-global-phenomenon\" title=\"\">age of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/14/how-selfies-became-a-global-phenomenon\" title=\"\">endless selfies</a>. I enthusiastically join in with the directions, shouting out \u201cdrop your hip\u201d far too many times than is appropriate. </p> <p>Once a few shots are taken, the subjects get to see the results. While they can point out any definite nos, they are reminded they don\u2019t get to choose the final picture. After all, who knows what their match\u2019s best pose will be? One subject, Hannah, wears red shoes and a matching skirt and immediately sticks in my mind. We ask her preferred type. Quick as a flash: \u201cNo posh boys. I\u2019ve dated a few and\u2026 no.\u201d Another woman tells us she is looking for what her friends would call \u201can intellectual hunk\u201d. \u201cYeah, I get a lot of requests for those,\u201d deadpans Nina.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&amp;number=75&amp;title=Age%20of%20oldest%20participant\" data-alt=\"Age of oldest participant\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&number=75&title=Age%20of%20oldest%20participant\">Age of oldest participant</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&amp;number=17&amp;title=Age%20of%20youngest%20participant%20(for%20a%20teen%20issue)\" data-alt=\"Age of youngest participant\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&number=17&title=Age%20of%20youngest%20participant%20(for%20a%20teen%20issue)\">Age of youngest participant</a> </figure>  <p>Towards the end of the shoot, we meet Peter.

Nina and I exchange a look. We glance through Peter\u2019s details again, then Hannah\u2019s. Is this happening <em>live</em>?</p> <p>Once Peter is gone, Nina, Linda and I get our heads together. We consider for a moment whether each would be better with other people we photographed tonight. Nope, it\u2019s definitely Peter and Hannah. The feeling of matching someone up is euphoric. Guys, I\u2019m sorry if it goes badly\u2026 this one\u2019s on me. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>It\u2019s a 10 from me: Justin Myers looks back on five favourite dates, and hears what happened next</strong></h2> <h2>Lizzie and Tomas, May 2017</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e89a4ce4af54a32585b3967fcf07bae164e875a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e89a4ce4af54a32585b3967fcf07bae164e875a4/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blind daters Lizzie and Tomas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzie and Tomas: \u2018Every answer fizzed off the page.\u2019 Photographs: Sarah Lee, Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee, Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tomas said</strong> \u201cShe looks extremely cool.\u201d</p> <p><strong>I said</strong> \u201cThis is, basically, saying \u2018I fancied her\u2019 two questions in without coming across like someone who bought a top hat in 2011 just in case they got married some day.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tomas said</strong> \u201cWe talked about vomit, urinal etiquette, nude cycling.\u201d</p> <p><strong>I said</strong> \u201cI have this feeling that when Tomas proposes to Lizzie \u2013 next autumn, at a place that meant something to her as a child, using the engagement ring of a relative or an antique bought with a legacy from a favourite godmother \u2013 he\u2019ll hide the ring inside a pudding or a pebble or something.

Mark said that reading my review of his date out loud to his mother was quite the experience: \u201cI can hardly describe her face when you called me \u2018something young and malleable\u2019 and \u2018a smooth-skinned honey in their 20s\u2019.\u201d Sorry, Mark\u2019s mum.</p> <p>Mark and Benjamin didn\u2019t opt for a second meeting, but Benjamin is now happily settled with his boyfriend. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together four years,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s wonderful, although I\u2019m not sure what score he\u2019d have given me on our first date.\u201d</p> <p>Best not to ask, Benjamin.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Martin and Almaz, June 2017</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"844b738baee252a6f8c6ea891081e638ff4149e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/844b738baee252a6f8c6ea891081e638ff4149e4/89_103_2389_1433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blind daters Martin and Almaz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin and Almaz: \u2018You could be forgiven for thinking there had been a mix-up.\u2019 Photographs: Alicia Canter, Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter,  Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Martin said</strong> \u201cShe was elegant, with a natural brightness and upbeat aura.\u201d</p> <p><strong>I said</strong> \u201cElegant is a man\u2019s way of saying a woman is tall and slim without wanting to sound like a judge on Miss World.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Almaz said</strong> \u201cI thought he was joking when he said he\u2019s a Cliff Richard fan.\u201d</p> <p><strong>I said</strong> \u201cThat noise you can hear is Almaz\u2019s taxi outside.

Martin wasn\u2019t trying to flirt with me, which really shocked me, because that\u2019s what you want on a date, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Despite some of Almaz\u2019s beautifully withering answers, the date itself wasn\u2019t too bad, she says, and they found plenty to talk about; she admits to a pang of guilt when she realised how different their final scores were. Almaz rated the evening a 6. \u201cI thought he might score me a 7 or 8, so I did feel bad when I saw I got a 10.\u201d</p> <p>The pair didn\u2019t swap numbers \u2013 although Almaz wishes she had given hers to the hot waiter after they \u201cshared some intense looks\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Did Saturdays even exist before the Blind date column? Not as far as I\u2019m concerned. The start of the weekend was a joyless desert until, in 2009, Weekend magazine started sending two hapless (my words) strangers out for dinner in the hope that three courses, a bottle of house white and the terror of appearing in a national newspaper would be the accelerant a romantic spark needs to go full inferno. I have been obsessed with Blind date for most of its 10-year existence. Its simplicity is deceptive: what the daters say leaves plenty of room for interpretation. On the surface, the questions are formulaic \u2013 somewhere between inane smalltalk at a stranger\u2019s house party and the sexless interrogation of a dietary questionnaire from your GP. But in the context of the column, they are traps \u2013 and I love to see the participants fall right in, revealing themselves via the short aside that they shared a pudding with their date. And let\u2019s not forget that score out of 10. Brutal to have adults rate one another, you might say. Delicious, I say. The key to its success? It\u2019s relatable. I used to write an anonymous dating blog as The Guyliner. I know what it\u2019s like out there. I have sat at deathly dull dinners with the king of halitosis talking about his loft conversion. I have taken sneaky glances at my watch as a partied-out zombie talked me through his negroni-inspired accumulator hangover. I have also dropped clangers, watched my date\u2019s face plummet and realised that my half of the bill is no longer an investment in a bright future, but a tax on my stupidity. This is why I love Blind date so much. But its two slim columns in the middle of Weekend, barely 400 words a week, weren\u2019t enough for me. Every Saturday, I would dash to social media to debrief with other devotees. The disasters! The fairytale endings! Even the kind of \u201cmeh\u201d ones where two clean-shirts spent two hours saying, \u201cNo, after you\u201d over a dish of calamari \u2013 we discussed them all. In July 2014, after years of writing about my own dates, I was coupled up and looking for something new to write about. It occurred to me that it might be fun to look deeper into Blind date, to read between the lines. In the same way that the Guardian\u2019s episode recaps of Line Of Duty or Game Of Thrones are must-reads for fans eager to dissect their favourite dramas, I wanted to put Blind date under the microscope. Thus my blog, Impeccable Table Manners, was born, taking its name from the stock reply given by many daters to the \u201cGood table manners?\u201d question. The tone is light snark, with greater savagery deployed occasionally for some of the biggest shockers. I try not to get too personal; I\u2019m critiquing what people say, not who they are, and I invite dates to get in touch if they want to give their side of the story. To my surprise, the blog\u2019s popularity grew and grew. Soon, every Saturday morning, my Twitter mentions were full of people asking when the review was going up \u2013 sometimes as early as 7.30am. (Guys, it\u2019s Saturday.) The idea was to take the daters\u2019 answers and run with them. Sometimes, quite far. Almost every column inspires me in some way, and if I get speechless, well, there is always an animated gif of Joan Collins rolling her eyes close at hand. And while this bit is fun, every week the date throws up a deeper topic for me to chew on. I have touched on loneliness, snobbery, racism, misogyny, masculinity, poverty and kindness. An awkward answer about who gets to pour the wine can get me going on just about anything. The blog has developed running gags of its own \u2013 my readers and I react very strongly to lateness (no!), negronis (yuck!), daters worrying they talked too much (you are on a date, hun; talking is the point), chopsticks (always a disaster), sharing food (no, thank you), people who say, \u201cI think my friends would be too much for them\u201d about their crew of magnolia acolytes and, of course, the dreaded \u201cimpeccable\u201d: find a new word (except don\u2019t, because I love it). There have been occupational hazards. One guy I reviewed is now my editor at GQ magazine (awkward). Another woman was halfway through doing my makeup for a photoshoot before mentioning she had had the Impeccable treatment (she still made me look good). And I have been stopped in the street on numerous occasions by daters and fans of both the Weekend column and Impeccable Table Manners. The cult of Blind date is bigger than you might think. They say you should never meet your heroes, but the completist in me wanted to find out exactly what goes on behind the scenes. Despite my readers\u2019 frequent frustrations at the \u201calgorithm\u201d that puts daters together, it is not a supercomputer that does the matching. Nina Trickey, Weekend\u2019s resident cupid, has been hooking up readers since 2012, curating the entire process: sifting the romantic hopefuls\u2019 applications, matching them, booking the restaurant and compiling their answers. She has the perfect credentials for the job: as a favour to her friend Anna, her predecessor as cupid, Nina appeared in Blind date No 2. She got on OK with Niall, 26. They scored each other an 8, but when asked if she would meet him again, Nina replied: \u201cNot romantically. Also, he didn\u2019t compliment me and I did him (on his shirt),\u201d thus setting the tone for the hundreds of daters who would follow. You need the precision of a heart surgeon to play Blind date matchmaker. Nina admits it can be hard. \u201cI can\u2019t match someone 100% of the time on what they say in that first email,\u201d she says. \u201cSome give you loads of information, but with others it\u2019s just two lines. I have to get them in, see them for myself.\u201d Daters are invited to have their photograph taken before their date \u2013 individually, of course, or where\u2019s the surprise? Sometimes applicants are too similar; the column is always running short of straight men, older couples and people outside the M25. While there may seem to be a Blind date \u201ctype\u201d, anyone is welcome to take part and the goal is to make the column as diverse as possible. Is there ever a risk of being set up with someone who is merely available, rather than a decent match? Nina shakes her head emphatically. \u201cNo, there has to be something there.\u201d Some daters wait quite a while \u2013 up to a year. \u201cI do feel bad for unmatched people still sitting in my inbox, but I never forget them,\u201d she says. The meal is on the restaurant, in return for the honour of being featured; daters get three courses and one bottle of wine. Regular readers often bemoan dates that happen on a \u201cschool night\u201d, which often prevents anyone getting too hot under the collar, but this is partly dictated by daters\u2019 schedules and the restaurant\u2019s availability. Even once the date is under way, there are fires to fight. A restaurant once accidentally offered the daters a very expensive tasting menu that they then asked the couple to pay for; on occasion, couples have twisted the rules when it comes to the free wine. No-shows are rare, although one poor guy seemed to have the worst luck. \u201cHis first date stood him up, so I set him up again,\u201d Nina says. \u201cThe second girl was a bit flakey and wouldn\u2019t commit to a date.\u201d So she took one for the team. Nina laughs: \u201cWell, I was single at the time\u2026 I asked him out myself.\u201d It didn\u2019t last, and Nina is now spoken for, but she has been asked out by potential matches more than a few times. Once the date is done, Nina sends out a questionnaire. The answer she looks forward to seeing the most? \u201cThe kiss, obviously! Just to see if I was right to match them \u2013 we do want people to get on. But I also like \u2018Will you meet again?\u2019\u201d The editors have been known to cheer when news of a good date reaches the office. Since the column began in 2009, 542 couples have judged each other\u2019s table manners. The first \u201cImpeccable!\u201d came early, in the very first date, while the first score of 10 came two months later \u2013 although it was not reciprocated. In fact, we waited almost five years for the first double 10, from students Josh and Biko, who answered \u201cDid you go on somewhere?\u201d with a baffling trip to M&amp;M\u2019s World in London. But to my mind, the first truly emphatic 10 \u2013 one of them even gave a bonus point for \u201ctaste in films\u201d \u2013 came from Lizzie and Tomas in May 2017, who are getting married later this year. And yes, Nina and I are invited and will be making sure they don\u2019t share their main course. Perhaps the biggest Blind date of all, published in January this year, belonged to Joanne and Morgan. This raucous duo really went for it \u2013 sinking endless bottles of wine, snogging ferociously, gatecrashing a party and, upon being ejected, discovering one of them had left their knickers behind. The encounter went viral; the next day, Joanne was on BBC Radio 5 Live explaining herself. But before anyone loses their underwear, lovers must be matched. Nina\u2019s cupid powers come into play at the photoshoot, where participants are photographed before their night out. It\u2019s a tightly run production line, as I found when I joined her last month. Daters are escorted from the Guardian\u2019s reception to a small studio and given 15 to 20 minutes to make the magic happen. Nina attends all the shoots, asking questions as she watches, her mind a Rolodex of potential matches. \u201cYou\u2019ll see for yourself,\u201d she says, as we wait for the first person to arrive. \u201cSometimes, something just clicks. But yes, there\u2019s also a spreadsheet.\u201d Without exception, each of tonight\u2019s six daters appears shellshocked. Suddenly, this becomes very real. Today\u2019s photographer is the Guardian staffer Linda Nylind, who tells me she loves guessing how people will get on. Our first dater, a guy in his early 20s, is a natural and keen on doing a James Bond pose. More nervous individuals have to be encouraged out of their shell, perhaps surprising in the age of endless selfies. I enthusiastically join in with the directions, shouting out \u201cdrop your hip\u201d far too many times than is appropriate. Once a few shots are taken, the subjects get to see the results. While they can point out any definite nos, they are reminded they don\u2019t get to choose the final picture. After all, who knows what their match\u2019s best pose will be? One subject, Hannah, wears red shoes and a matching skirt and immediately sticks in my mind. We ask her preferred type. Quick as a flash: \u201cNo posh boys. I\u2019ve dated a few and\u2026 no.\u201d Another woman tells us she is looking for what her friends would call \u201can intellectual hunk\u201d. \u201cYeah, I get a lot of requests for those,\u201d deadpans Nina. Towards the end of the shoot, we meet Peter. We watch him pose \u2013 he is very enthusiastic and funny, but struggles when asked to touch his beard, going full Gunpowder Plot conspiratorial scratch. Then the cogs start to turn. Nina and I exchange a look. We glance through Peter\u2019s details again, then Hannah\u2019s. Is this happening live? Once Peter is gone, Nina, Linda and I get our heads together. We consider for a moment whether each would be better with other people we photographed tonight. Nope, it\u2019s definitely Peter and Hannah. The feeling of matching someone up is euphoric. Guys, I\u2019m sorry if it goes badly\u2026 this one\u2019s on me. * * * It\u2019s a 10 from me: Justin Myers looks back on five favourite dates, and hears what happened next Lizzie and Tomas, May 2017 Tomas said \u201cShe looks extremely cool.\u201d I said \u201cThis is, basically, saying \u2018I fancied her\u2019 two questions in without coming across like someone who bought a top hat in 2011 just in case they got married some day.\u201d Tomas said \u201cWe talked about vomit, urinal etiquette, nude cycling.\u201d I said \u201cI have this feeling that when Tomas proposes to Lizzie \u2013 next autumn, at a place that meant something to her as a child, using the engagement ring of a relative or an antique bought with a legacy from a favourite godmother \u2013 he\u2019ll hide the ring inside a pudding or a pebble or something. Please don\u2019t do that, Tomas.\u201d Lizzie said \u201cIt was really hot in the restaurant, so I kept fanning myself like a delicate Dickensian woman.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t think she was fanning herself because of the temperature in the restaurant, do you, readers?\u201d Lizzie and Tomas\u2019s date was published in a dark week, just after the Manchester Arena attack. This pair melted my icy heart because they were so unapologetically into each other. Every answer fizzed off the page with bubbles of joy, and their date was an emphatic double 10. What happened next? \u201cWhen I saw he\u2019d scored me a 10, I felt all warm and fuzzy inside,\u201d Lizzie says now. On seeing his 10, Tomas claims he thought: \u201cShe is a great judge of character.\u201d Lizzie had been inspired to apply after reading through all the past Blind date columns on a Megabus journey home from Bristol. \u201cI hoped I\u2019d meet my true love, but never for one second thought I actually would,\u201d she says. Both read my blog, so buckled in for a roasting there. \u201cWe were spared,\u201d Tomas says. \u201cIt made the Blind date experience even more joyous.\u201d Lizzie adds: \u201cIt really summed up our feelings towards each other. By the third date, I wanted to be with Tom for ever. No messing about.\u201d Wow. There appears to be something in my eye. She wasn\u2019t wrong \u2013 the pair got engaged in April 2018, and the wedding is this winter. But if we are searching for downsides, even this romantic bliss has a dark cloud. \u201cI wish I\u2019d done something with my hair,\u201d says Lizzie of the Guardian photoshoot. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise that, if the date goes really well and you end up getting married, that bad hair day will follow you through the rest of your life.\u201d So, Lizzie\u2019s advice: get your hair done. And from Tomas? \u201cApply! It\u2019s great fun and you never know where it might lead.\u201d Beautiful. * * * Benjamin and Mark, June 2015 Benjamin said \u201cWe talked about our shared desire for a Georgian terrace house by Highbury Fields.\u201d I said \u201cDid you go to the top of the page, as I did, and check their ages again? You turn up on a date with some smooth-skinned honey in their 20s and all you can talk about is wanting a house?\u201d Mark said \u201cIntroduce him to my friends? I don\u2019t think the opportunity will arise.\u201d I said \u201cCan anyone smell roasting flesh? Because, baby, that burns.\u201d Benjamin said \u201cMark in three words? Smart, musical, cute.\u201d I said \u201cI am trying to imagine these two \u2018doing it\u2019, but all I can picture is two John Lewis gift cards sliding around on top of each other.\u201d Benjamin, a 27-year-old composer, and Mark, a 21-year-old editorial assistant, did everything they could to destroy my theory that Blind dates involving two men were always more raucous. Two old heads on young shoulders, they talked of Bj\u00f6rk, operettas and property. At least they shattered a few stereotypes along the way. Looking back on it now, Benjamin concedes: \u201cThe evening was spark-free and chemistry-light.\u201d He feels Mark may have been taking the date a lot more seriously than he had been expecting. \u201cNo one really goes on Blind date to find true love, right?\u201d Mark\u2019s take was more vinegary. \u201cI could tell fairly well how it had gone,\u201d Benjamin says, \u201cbut his first adjective to describe me was \u2018punctual\u2019 \u2013 brutal.\u201d Mark confesses he regrets his words a little. \u201cI came across as cold and cruel, which was definitely not the intention,\u201d he insists. \u201cI had a good time, but clearly struggled to convey that.\u201d He concedes that the friends quip was \u201csavage\u201d. The thing to remember about going on a Blind date is that people you know will see it. And so will your mother. Mark said that reading my review of his date out loud to his mother was quite the experience: \u201cI can hardly describe her face when you called me \u2018something young and malleable\u2019 and \u2018a smooth-skinned honey in their 20s\u2019.\u201d Sorry, Mark\u2019s mum. Mark and Benjamin didn\u2019t opt for a second meeting, but Benjamin is now happily settled with his boyfriend. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together four years,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s wonderful, although I\u2019m not sure what score he\u2019d have given me on our first date.\u201d Best not to ask, Benjamin. * * * Martin and Almaz, June 2017 Martin said \u201cShe was elegant, with a natural brightness and upbeat aura.\u201d I said \u201cElegant is a man\u2019s way of saying a woman is tall and slim without wanting to sound like a judge on Miss World.\u201d Almaz said \u201cI thought he was joking when he said he\u2019s a Cliff Richard fan.\u201d I said \u201cThat noise you can hear is Almaz\u2019s taxi outside. She called it before Martin even got to the second syllable of \u2018Richard\u2019.\u201d Almaz said \u201cDid we go on somewhere? It was a Sunday night, so no.\u201d I said \u201cYes, I am positive the only thing holding you back from a wild pub crawl of the capital\u2019s low joints with Martin was the fact it was a Sunday night. You\u2019re 28!\u201d You could be forgiven for thinking there had been a mix-up, that Almaz and Martin were actually on two different dates. Martin was sweet and kind, perhaps too pure for this world, while Almaz was keen to make it clear he wasn\u2019t her bag \u2013 and all credit to her, really, because there is no time for messing on a Blind date. Reflecting on it now, Almaz admits: \u201cThere was definitely no chemistry. Martin wasn\u2019t trying to flirt with me, which really shocked me, because that\u2019s what you want on a date, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Despite some of Almaz\u2019s beautifully withering answers, the date itself wasn\u2019t too bad, she says, and they found plenty to talk about; she admits to a pang of guilt when she realised how different their final scores were. Almaz rated the evening a 6. \u201cI thought he might score me a 7 or 8, so I did feel bad when I saw I got a 10.\u201d The pair didn\u2019t swap numbers \u2013 although Almaz wishes she had given hers to the hot waiter after they \u201cshared some intense looks\u201d. The experience may not have found her a boyfriend, but it inspired Almaz creatively: in 2018, she launched her own website, Kayleigh Daniels Dated, writing raunchy dating stories as a fictional character. Now that is a plot twist I wasn\u2019t expecting. \u201cI just really love dating,\u201d she says. \u201cAny chance to go on one, I will take.\u201d * * * Tom and Emily, October 2016 They said \u201cWe talked about which supermarket makes the best hummus, the importance of lamps, and Lancaster University, where we both went.\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019m calling it right here and now that these two will end up together, for the origin story alone.\u201d Tom said \u201cIn the panic of the hello I forgot Emily\u2019s name.\u201d I said \u201cI reckon you could take a look at Emily from across the aisle at your favourite Waitrose and guess she was called Emily, but we\u2019ll let you off, Tom.\u201d They said \u201cWe got the number 52 bus (we live just down the road from one another).\u201d I said \u201cSee? This is a silver-wedding anniversary anecdote waiting to happen. I can practically hear the light thud of grandchildren plonking themselves down into an overstuffed armchair to hear this story.\u201d Sometimes, when you know, you just know. Tom and Emily\u2019s date was romcom perfect: he accidentally shaved a patch out of his beard that morning and Emily turned up with paint all over her hands. Imagine those little disasters in a montage with Clean Bandit\u2019s Rather Be playing over it. Tom had left his application email sitting in his drafts for days and says he was stuck in a rut until he hit send. \u201cI felt like this small act of recklessness might snap me out of it.\u201d And it certainly did. Tom and Emily are still a couple: they have moved in together and adopted \u201ca big ginger cat called Gordon\u201d. By the time their date was published, the pair had been on further dates, but Emily had refused to divulge her answers \u2013 or her score \u2013 which Tom admits was \u201cslightly worrying\u201d. Emily was pleased to discover that Tom awarded her an 8, but felt \u201csimultaneously terrible about the score she gave in return\u201d. Says Tom now: \u201cThat 7.5 cut deep.\u201d Emily struggled to answer the \u201cWhat do you think he made of you?\u201d question. \u201cI knew I was going to struggle to hit the middle ground between totally self-delusional and toe-curlingly falsely modest,\u201d she says. That said, she would definitely recommend the Blind date experience. \u201cAt the very least, you\u2019ll have a good anecdote for your next Tinder date.\u201d Both Tom and Emily agree \u2013 as do I \u2013 that the column needs older couples to apply. \u201cI like the way they approach their answers,\u201d Tom says. \u201cI feel incredibly lucky to have met someone in this strange and slightly terrifying way.\u201d * * * Joanne and Morgan, January 2019 Joanne said \u201cWe got kicked out of the house party we crashed. And I left my knickers behind.\u201d I said \u201cThe LGBTQ crew deliver. They\u2019re taking life in both hands and squeezing it harder than your window cleaner wrings out his chamois.\u201d Morgan said \u201cShe is obscenely fun.\u201d I said \u201cWhere would these women be if one of them had said no thanks to that fourth negroni? Home, separately, knickers on. It\u2019s no kind of life.\u201d They said \u201cShe\u2019s a 10.\u201d I said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens next. We will always have today \u2013 this one perfect, bawdy date, which ended in a fat round 20, with no knickers on. And nobody can take it away from us.\u201d It\u2019s no understatement to say that Joanne and Morgan\u2019s date became the stuff of legend. \u201cI was really quite surprised,\u201d Joanne says now, \u201cbecause it was just an honest account of a fun night.\u201d She has been reading the column this year and enjoys the \u201clittle nods we\u2019ve been getting here and there\u201d from people who have appeared since. They were certainly a hard act to follow: you couldn\u2019t blame subsequent daters for feeling inferior if their own date didn\u2019t end as raucously. Joanne admits that, if she had known she was going to go viral, she might have rethought the outfit: \u201cMorgan was too kind. I was wearing a pink beret, Justin.\u201d Joanne, who is bi, despite being tagged a \u201chilarious millennial lesbian\u201d by fans of the date, enjoyed the positive reaction, but nothing further happened between her and Morgan. She urges all Blind daters to make the most of their moment. \u201cI can\u2019t believe people still do the whole \u2018it\u2019s a school night\u2019 thing,\u201d she says. \u201cGuys! It\u2019s free! Free food! Free booze! But what do I know? I\u2019m still single.\u201d She also warns that, if you get Blind-date famous, there is a chance it will follow you for ever. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of dates mention it,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope they\u2019re not too scared. I promise them I like to go to the park and just hang out as well. But then, just last night, my date said: \u2018Well, there\u2019s been no knickers left behind. Has it been a bad date?\u2019\u201d The answer to that, of course, is yes. \u2022 Click here to find out how this week\u2019s Blind daters, Hannah and Peter, got on.

      "bodyText": "Peter on Hannah What were you hoping for? A clickbait-worthy evening of cringe. First impressions? Prompt, eminently comfortable with awkwardness. What did you talk about? The woeful state of sex education in schools, working with government agencies, terrible dates and how much food we could get away with ordering \u2013 turns out, a lot. Any awkward moments? When I knocked a glass of water all over the table within minutes of meeting. Good table manners? Impeccable. Best thing about Hannah? Her willingness to keep ordering more food and booze. I\u2019m still full. Would you introduce her to your friends? Sure, though they\u2019d probably look at each other like first-contact aliens. Describe Hannah in three words? Friendly, conversational, thoughtful. What do you think she made of you? Probably an awkward parody of myself on a mission to generate sweet, sweet content. Did you go on somewhere? Smithfield meat market for a wander. Yes, after the vegan restaurant. And... did you kiss? We both ran away before that could happen. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? That my suggestion of finding an abandoned building to explore was taken up. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? I\u2019d be up for another casual wander around an ironic meat market. Hannah on Peter What were you hoping for? Someone hot, good conversation. I didn\u2019t want someone poncey. First impressions? Super cool. I felt I was in for a good night with someone interesting. What did you talk about? Standard London millennial stuff: museums, books, films. Any awkward moments? He responded well to my rant about how we don\u2019t learn about vaginas. Good table manners? Impeccable. Best thing about Peter? He was really cool. He made me feel a bit inadequate. Would you introduce him to your friends? Don\u2019t see why not, but not in a romantic way. Describe Peter in three words? A creative nerd. What do you think he made of you? I hope he thought I was cool and easygoing, but he also might have thought I was a bit square because I didn\u2019t want to break into a building with him. Did you go on somewhere? Smithfield market to kiss a pig. And... did you kiss? No, I didn\u2019t want to. Then when we were saying \u2019bye, he started edging away. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I would have been more daring, but I am not very good on a school night. Marks out of 10? 8. Would you meet again? Probably not.

      "body": "<p>It has been a brutal re-entry into normal life after summer, and no one is handling it particularly well. Unlike previous years we seemed, on first glance, to be doing so well. Air travel with four-year-olds is infinitely easier than with three-year-olds. We were lucky with immigration and sailed through in 10 minutes. And travelling from London to New York \u2013 east to west \u2013 the jet lag is a breeze. And then we all went back to work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The burden of keeping someone\u2019s needs in mind when committed elsewhere is one my mother\u2019s generation had no word for</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is often said that parenting is harder labour than paid employment, and in most respects this is true. As all parents of young children know, at work you get to do extravagant things like go to the loo without someone following you in and talk to other adults without interruption. For every 10 minutes of applied concentration, you can spend another five futzing about on the internet. At the end of three weeks of unbroken time with my children, a treacherous part of me was looking forward to returning to my desk while they did their last week of camp before school.</p> <p>And we all had high hopes. After a break of this length, for a second the old routine looks inviting, something to which one returns with all sorts of cheerful resolutions. We would get up an hour earlier. We would eat more oatmeal and fewer gummy worms. I would, finally, learn to execute a French braid. God help me, on the plane back to the US I started reading a feminist reinterpretation of the Iliad.</p> <p>This bright new dawn lasted approximately 48 hours. And then the wheels fell off.

      "bodyText": "It has been a brutal re-entry into normal life after summer, and no one is handling it particularly well. Unlike previous years we seemed, on first glance, to be doing so well. Air travel with four-year-olds is infinitely easier than with three-year-olds. We were lucky with immigration and sailed through in 10 minutes. And travelling from London to New York \u2013 east to west \u2013 the jet lag is a breeze. And then we all went back to work. It is often said that parenting is harder labour than paid employment, and in most respects this is true. As all parents of young children know, at work you get to do extravagant things like go to the loo without someone following you in and talk to other adults without interruption. For every 10 minutes of applied concentration, you can spend another five futzing about on the internet. At the end of three weeks of unbroken time with my children, a treacherous part of me was looking forward to returning to my desk while they did their last week of camp before school. And we all had high hopes. After a break of this length, for a second the old routine looks inviting, something to which one returns with all sorts of cheerful resolutions. We would get up an hour earlier. We would eat more oatmeal and fewer gummy worms. I would, finally, learn to execute a French braid. God help me, on the plane back to the US I started reading a feminist reinterpretation of the Iliad. This bright new dawn lasted approximately 48 hours. And then the wheels fell off. I don\u2019t mean we descended into chaos. But the transition back to real life became suddenly fraught and exhausting. My children, not usually clingy, rebelled against losing their mother\u2019s undivided attention and embarked on a series of meltdowns. And in my excitement to get back to work, I\u2019d forgotten one crucial thing: that on holiday, for all the hard labour of wrestling two four-year-olds in and out of bathing suits and up and down the country, I\u2019d had only one grid up in my mind.

      "bodyText": "Days after Donald Trump returned from another contentious encounter with his fellow G7 world leaders, a Kremlin-backed TV channel painted a derisive picture of his overtures to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin. Likening the US president\u2019s staunch defense of his Russian counterpart to a tortuous love affair, the channel aired a mashup in which Trump\u2019s speeches were pieced together to form the lyrics of Se\u00f1orita \u2013 a summer ballad performed by the US pop stars Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello. \u201cI love it when you call me Se\u00f1orita, I wish I could pretend I didn\u2019t need ya,\u201d Trump appeared to say. \u201cOoh, I should be running, ooh, you keep me coming for ya.\u201d The segment included images of Putin playing the piano, the pair in sync, much to the chagrin of the EU and members of the US Congress. Trump\u2019s affinity for Putin and other autocrats has long drawn criticism, for upending the norms of US foreign policy and alienating traditional allies. But his pro-Russia posture in Biarritz left former diplomats and national security experts baffled and sounding fresh alarms. \u201cTrump represents an American foreign policy tradition that we haven\u2019t seen empowered in the presidency since before World War II,\u201d said Daniel Fried, assistant secretary of state for Europe from 2005 to 2009. \u201cThe last time this kind of thinking was powerful in the United States, it was in the content of the isolationist movement \u2026 the belief that our getting involved in European security was not in America\u2019s interests. \u201cIt\u2019s a cynical view that power is the only measure for success, and I happen to think it\u2019s a dangerous view because it undervalues the free world.\u201d Trump signaled his intent to advocate on Putin\u2019s behalf prior to departing for the G7 summit, publicly reiterating his view that Russia should be reinstated to the gathering of the world\u2019s leading industrialized economies. It was ejected in 2014, as punishment for the annexation of Crimea. Trump insisted the Kremlin should have a seat at the table and attributed Russian aggression in eastern Europe to the failures of his own predecessor, Barack Obama. Other leaders, with the exception of Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, vehemently objected to Trump\u2019s demands. Within days of his return to Washington, Trump made another move that seemed likely to please Putin: officials said the White House was considering blocking $250m in military assistance to Ukraine. That would put Trump at odds with the Pentagon, which designated the funds to help counter pro-Russian separatists backed by the Kremlin. \u201cTrump\u2019s deference to Putin remains one of Washington\u2019s greatest mysteries,\u201d said Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to former vice-president Joe Biden. \u201cNo one knows for sure whether it\u2019s just Trump\u2019s admiration for Putin\u2019s authoritarian rule or it\u2019s the fact that Trump owes Putin something. \u201cEither way, Trump\u2019s refusal to speak ill of Putin or Russia\u2019s aggression in its neighborhood and beyond is eroding US leadership and the transatlantic alliance.\u201d \u2018Allies are growing tired\u2019 A two-year investigation led by the special counsel Robert Mueller examined Trump\u2019s ties to Russia but found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy. Mueller did, however, find numerous instances of coordination and disclosed that Trump pursued a business deal in Moscow that could have earned him hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump\u2019s fixation with Russia was not the only source of consternation among foreign policy experts this week. He also skipped a discussion in Biarritz dedicated to addressing the climate crisis and fires burning across the southern Amazon. After Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, said he would reject $20m in aid agreed to by the G7 nations and meant to combat the fires, Trump sided with Brazil. \u201cI have gotten to know [Bolsonaro] well in our dealings with Brazil,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHe is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil \u2013 Not easy. He and his country have the full and complete support of the USA!\u201d Bolsonaro has drawn comparisons to Trump, touting far-right nationalist views and making incendiary comments about women, indigenous groups and other minorities. Trump has also continued to pick fights with US allies, such as calling off a trip to Denmark after its prime minister dismissed his interest in purchasing Greenland. \u201cAllies are growing tired of the constant barrage of attacks, especially in light of his praise for authoritarian leaders,\u201d said Smith. \u201cFew in Europe see the two sides of the Atlantic sharing a positive common agenda.\u201d Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been defined by escalating trade wars and his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, which has dramatically increased tension between Washington and Tehran. \u201cThe end result is that countries are starting to hedge and willingly cozy up to countries like China just in case the relationship with the US continues to deteriorate,\u201d Smith said. A new study by the Brookings Institution underscored the fragility of the transatlantic relationship when it measured policy success in the age of Trump through \u201cthe absence of disasters\u201d. \u201cThe US president and his administration have made their distaste for the European Union and some European allies plain,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe feeling appears to be reciprocated in many European quarters.\u201d \u201cThe calm, in other words, is deceptive and unlikely to last.\u201d",

The 5G-capable Mate 30 will be revealed at a 19 September event in Munich, CNBC reported on Friday. But the launch by a company that saw its share of the European smartphone market soar by 55.7% in 2018 is approaching under a cloud of uncertainty, thanks to the actions of the US government. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the dispute between the US and Huawei. What is Huawei? Huawei is a Chinese telecommunications company, founded in 1987, whose early history included updating China\u2019s telephone infrastructure and helping the nation transition away from relying on importing foreign-made technology. It has since expanded internationally and launched its own product lines, including smartphones that are increasingly competitive with Samsung and Apple. Why is it controversial?

The US has pressured its allies not to use Huawei components in the 5G networks they are building, saying it may discontinue intelligence sharing if they continue to work with the firm. The US also arranged for the arrest of the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of its founder and chairman, in Canada in December 2018, on allegations of bank and wire fraud to violate US sanctions against Iran. In May, the Trump administration escalated its attacks on Huawei with twin moves: an executive order that allows the government to ban technology from \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d if they are determined to pose \u201cunacceptable risks\u201d to national security, and the placement of Huawei on a commerce department \u201centity list\u201d that bans it from acquiring components or technology from US companies without government approval.

Smoke coiling into the evening air wards off the gnats and midges while the potatoes nestle in the embers. I\u2019ve just started boiling the eggs when my son returns from the woodpile with an expression of blended revulsion and puzzlement, and holds out a log on which are arrayed what look at first glance like a row of large turds, though on closer inspection they are more like carbonised doughballs. They\u2019re brittle and almost weightless and, cracked open, they reveal growth rings \u2013 matryoshka layers of charcoal and silver, ball within ball within ball. A copious dusting of spores escapes to coat fingers, clothes and the logs we\u2019re perched on. They are King Alfred\u2019s cake fungi, Daldinia concentrica. Inedible, but we could have used them as slow-burning firelighters had we discovered them sooner. A campfire yarn unfurls. A story about a great man, king of England \u2013 or was it just Wessex?

One Trinidadian boy, now 15, was taken to Syria by his father in 2014. In the last days of the battle of Baghuz, Isis forced him to fight and he was lucky to escape to al-Hawl alive. His father and siblings are dead and he now whiles away the days teaching himself maths from a battered textbook at one of al-Hawl\u2019s two small orphanage buildings. \u201cMy mum knows I\u2019m here. I miss her very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep asking, \u2018Why can\u2019t I go home?\u2019 but nobody ever has a real answer.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/judy-garland\">Judy Garland</a> fans, the final station of the cross in the ordeal of her last years was a five-week booking at the Talk of the Town nightclub in London in 1969, which she desperately needed for the money. In those famous and often chaotic concerts she appeared frail, unwell, tipsy or bleary-eyed: mannerisms that she had long since semi-consciously incorporated into her live act. But they were real at some level. Also real were the many flashes of the old magic; emotional arias made more glorious for having been wrenched from her battered heart. This movie is about that troubled period: a defiant last stand in full view of her passionately supportive fans. It was Judy\u2019s emotional Alamo in the face of parasitic husbands, spiteful press and misogynist showbiz overlords \u2013 beginning with studio chief Louis B Mayer, who ruined her childhood on the yellow brick road to stardom.</p> <p>Judy is adapted by screenwriter Tom Edge from Peter Quilter\u2019s stage play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/nov/23/end-of-the-rainbow-review-theatre\">End of the Rainbow</a>, and is directed by Rupert Goold; Ren\u00e9e Zellweger gives us a heartfelt, studied portrayal of Garland. Her performance and the film itself are forthright and un-camp, though careful to acknowledge the importance of Garland\u2019s gay fanbase by adroitly creating two fictional gay superfans. It is clearly influenced by Garland\u2019s own self-mythologising movie about her British period, <a href=\"https://variety.com/1962/film/reviews/i-could-go-on-singing-1200420404/\">I Could Go on Singing</a> (1963), about the gutsy yet vulnerable singing star doing shows at the London Palladium.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98t7aXRaA6w\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/98t7aXRaA6w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But this is really a standard-issue biopic heartwarmer about a Hollywood star in decline and in Blighty: a bit like the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/21/stan-and-ollie-review-laurel-and-hardy-steve-coogan-john-c-reilly\">Stan &amp; Ollie</a>, about Laurel and Hardy\u2019s final British tours. We get the usual sobering biographical grace notes over the final credits, although not the traditional black-and-white photos of the real-life people, perhaps because Judy Garland is just too well known. The film sugarcoats Garland\u2019s physical deterioration, her addictions, her wretchedness and her mortality. However, paradoxically, it\u2019s the most relaxed and personal performance we have seen from Zellweger in a while.</p> <p>She plays a resilient Judy who has taken all that life has to throw at her and (to borrow a line used in the recent Elton John film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/rocketman-review-elton-john-biopic-thats-better-at-the-tiaras-than-the-tantrums\">Rocketman</a>) she is still \u2026 well, sometimes she\u2019s not standing, sometimes she\u2019s actually falling over on stage. But she\u2019s still battling on many fronts, mostly financial, living in California, divorced from her third husband, Sid Luft (Rufus Sewell), and in an acrimonious dispute with him about the children. There\u2019s no money coming in and when the London residency is mooted, she jumps at the chance of solid earnings and a restorative blast of adoration from British admirers. But there\u2019s no chance of taking the children with her, and so she manages loneliness with booze and pills (the film doesn\u2019t do justice to the scale of her drug dependency). She is uneasy with her Brit promoter Bernard Delfont (Michael Gambon), but has support from exasperated assistant Rosalyn Wilder (Jessie Buckley). So the London gigs commence, interspersed with flashbacks to her unhappy childhood on the Oz set, with Darci Shaw as the young Judy. In the present day, there\u2019s a new chance of romance with a handsome cocktail waiter called Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock). You don\u2019t have to be a Garlandologist to figure out if that is going to end well.</p> <p>Zellweger rises resolutely to the challenge of playing Judy on stage and off: her eyes crinkle in tandem with a tremulous pout when her feelings are hurt, and sometimes when they are the opposite of hurt, although she is perhaps less convincing with the wide-eyed Garland gaze. Her walk and stance cleverly convey the sense of someone who is only in her 40s but feels older, but is rejuvenated by the electric thrill of being on stage. Yet the movie missed a trick in the way it depicted the difficult relationship with her daughter Liza Minnelli (played here by Gemma-Leah Devereux): there is one low-key meeting between them at a party in which Judy undermines Liza\u2019s confidence, but it is underpowered. Liza herself deserves almost as much mythologising and turbocharged drama as Judy, and a mother-daughter encounter between these icons should really be a showstopper.</p> <p>There was only ever really one way and one tune to end this film, and it duly arrives along with an interesting and realistic touch about the necessity of not expecting miracles. Zellweger gives us a tribute to Judy Garland\u2019s flair and to that ethos of the show needing to go on being both a burden and driving force. Yet Garland\u2019s terrible sadness is mostly invisible.</p>",

Earlier this week, Stephens had a very public meltdown after David Karpf, an associate professor at George Washington University, compared him to a bedbug on Twitter. Stephens sent an email to both the professor and the university provost in an attempt to get the professor in trouble, which promptly went viral. Stephens deleted his Twitter account amid the ensuing backlash. That could have been the end of the whole saga. But alas. On Friday, Stephens used his weekly column to issue a warning about the modern dangers of hateful comments disseminated through mass communications, drawing a line from Hitler\u2019s radio addresses to the power of social media today. In the ultimate subtweet move, Stephens didn\u2019t even reference what had happened on Twitter - rather, the column casually dropped a quote about bedbugs in relation to the burning of Warsaw\u2019s Jewish ghetto. David Karpf, the author of the tweet that started the saga, told the Guardian he was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d that Stephens escalated what should have been \u201ca silly argument\u201d. \u201cBret Stephens does not appear to have the humility to admit that he was having a bad night, overreacted and was wrong,\u201d Karpf said. In his column, Stephens decries the \u201crhetoric of infestation\u201d , arguing that it\u2019s back today. He points at Donald Trump using it to describe Latin American immigrants and Jaroslaw Kaczy\u0144ski, the chairman of Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party, saying that migrants carried \u201call sorts of parasites and protozoa\u201d. \u201cStephens states in his op-ed that eliminationist rhetoric is particularly prominent from the left. That isn\u2019t the least bit true, and the Times ought to hire a factchecker to challenge him on these assertions,\u201d Karpf continued. \u201cHe also says that the most reviled people in American politics are the moderate Republicans ... again, this is embarrassingly self-centered and obviously untrue.\u201d Meanwhile, internet sleuths were quick to tactfully decompose Stephens\u2019 argument. Following the link that Stephens left in his column suggests that he searched \u201cJews as bedbugs\u201d on Google books to find the quote in question \u2013 \u201cThe bedbugs are on fire.

Twitter users were also quick to point out that it wasn\u2019t that long ago when Stephens referred to Palestinians as mosquitos in a Wall Street Journal column in 2013. The Guardian\u2019s own senior tech reporter Julia Carrie Wong noted that Stephens\u2019 comparison of Twitter to the radio in the 1930s as a \u201ca channel that could concentrate political fury\u201d was flawed; radio was the dominant medium of its time, while today many outlets for hate speech exist.

But, he said, the idea of publicly funded elections had \u201chit the sand\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNeither party has an interest in doing it because we\u2019re locked in a funding arms race, and vested interests like the commercial media don\u2019t want to see public funding because it means less ads on television and in newspapers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This week, Guardian Australia has spoken to a number of current and former Labor officials who have described an often toxic culture within the party\u2019s head office. The structure of the ALP in NSW means that the general secretary of the party is the de facto leader of the right faction, while the left is led by its sole assistant secretary.</p> <p>That often leads to competing priorities \u2013 what\u2019s good for the right isn\u2019t necessarily good for the party and vice versa \u2013 and means there is often a lack of trust within the building.</p> <p>Tales about the petty animosities between the two factions at Sussex Street fill the folklore of Labor in NSW. One general secretary would print screeds of documents when he knew his leftwing assistant needed to use it. Another leftwing assistant secretary had to fight for months to get access to a locked stationery cupboard.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re from the left you basically know the one assistant secretary in Sussex Street and they\u2019re sitting there surrounded by the enemy, you know,\u201d said Meredith Burgmann, the former president of the NSW parliament upper house and a doyen of the Labor left. .</p> <p>Burgmann said the party\u2019s head office had been unduly focused on raising money and fighting factional wars. A culture of internal promotion, she said, had helped foster that.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that for the last few years they\u2019ve been promoting people from inside, which I don\u2019t think has been terribly helpful because if there was a poor culture there it\u2019s just flowed on,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI do think Kaila Murnain was trying to clean things up, and I think she was horrified by what she was told [by Ernest Wong] but \u2026 she should have known better.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, Murnain is less a cause than a symptom of a wider problem. Removing her won\u2019t fix the root cause of NSW Labor\u2019s malaise.</p> <p>\u201cIf all the previous structures and conditions remain the same, the culture will not change,\u201d Rees said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75aaeaf08cd8c084a522ce9d6ac803d8da3a292a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75aaeaf08cd8c084a522ce9d6ac803d8da3a292a/0_0_5228_3485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kaila Murnain said she quickly called her mentor and then Labor senator, Sam Dastyari, pictured, for advice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kaila Murnain said she quickly called her mentor and then Labor senator, Sam Dastyari, pictured, for advice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe problem is in the culture. It\u2019s the process of entry into the machine through young Labor and up the totem pole. If you want to change culture, you have to change the pattern of ascension and it has been abundantly clear for some time that the culture has been less than ideal.\u201d</p> <p>Any equivocation about Murnain\u2019s future ended shortly after her evidence on Wednesday.

      "bodyText": "One of Labor\u2019s favourite Chinatown eateries was packed as Kaila Murnain readied herself to speak. It was 2014, the year before the fateful Labor fundraiser at the centre of this week\u2019s explosive anti-corruption hearings. But the scene was largely the same. The Eight Restaurant in Haymarket was at capacity, the room full of wealthy donors cosying up to some of the most powerful Labor figures in the state. Murnain turned to a small group of Labor supporters before her official speech, and allegedly said: \u201cI\u2019ve been told I need to thank Mr Huang.\u201d Union official Dominic Ofner was at Murnain\u2019s table that night, and was one of the people that allegedly heard Murnain\u2019s aside about Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo. \u201cThe comment was memorable because I received the impression from [Murnain\u2019s] verbal tone and facial expression that she found it unusual she had been asked to thank him in her speech,\u201d Ofner told the Independent Commission Against Corruption in a statement recalling the event. Murnain didn\u2019t know it then, but five years later that name would lead to her political downfall. Murnain\u2019s suspension as general secretary was the crescendo in yet another week of scandal for NSW Labor. It has found itself at the centre of damaging corruption probe involving an Aldi bag containing $100,000 in cash, an elaborate scheme to mask payments from banned donors, the suicide of a significant witness, and instructions that the party \u201ckeep quiet\u201d about possible illegality. This week Icac has heard allegations that Huang \u2013 a property developer and banned donor \u2013 hand-delivered $100,000 cash to Labor\u2019s Sussex Street headquarters in April 2015, passing it on to then general secretary, Jamie Clements. Evidence suggests Huang may have paid the money to secure prime seats next to Labor leaders Bill Shorten and Luke Foley at a fundraising dinner several weeks earlier, but that his contribution was hidden on official records using 20 fake $5,000 donations from 12 straw donors. Previously one of the most powerful Labor figures in the country, Murnain was suspended this week after Icac heard she had known since 2016 that Labor had likely taken unlawful donations. The newly installed leader of NSW Labor, Jodi McKay, said: \u201cShe\u2019s a broken woman. She is 32 years old and her entire career has come grinding to a halt in the worst possible way.\u201d NSW Labor, McKay said, was in a \u201cterrible state\u201d. \u201cIt is up to us to rebuild trust with the people of NSW, that is my job,\u201d she said. But how do you fix a branch with which sleaze and scandal is basically synonymous? Former leader Luke Foley resigned in 2018 over allegations he inappropriately touched a female reporter at a boozy Christmas function. Murnain\u2019s predecessor as NSW Labor general secretary, Jamie Clements, quit in 2016 after facing mounting pressure over harassment allegations. There\u2019s been Eddie Obeid, Ian MacDonald and Joe Tripodi. The former Labor premier Nathan Rees, who famously sought to stare down factional control of the NSW party before being ousted, said the culture inside Labor\u2019s head office was \u201cjust wrong\u201d and had been for years. \u201cSussex Street has had a whatever it takes attitude for a long time,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cUltimately this has led to this situation in which not only a law has allegedly been circumvented, but the party\u2019s policy position in terms of accepting donations has also been breached. \u201cTo describe the feeling of ordinary members as red hot angry would be an understatement, they are absolutely filthy.\u201d Suggestions on how NSW Labor can fix its many problems are hardly in short supply. The former Labor senator John Faulkner pushed for donation reform unsuccessfully for years at a federal level, and in 2014 gave a speech in which he pleaded with the party to change by loosening factional and trade union control. \u201cThe stench of corruption which has come to characterise the NSW Labor party must be eliminated,\u201d Faulkner said at the time. Faulkner\u2019s calls mostly went unheeded, while Rees\u2019s own attempts to introduce publicly-funded elections in NSW \u2013 a proposal supported this week by Labor and Liberal powerbrokers Stephen Conroy and Michael Kroger \u2013 were also frustrated. As premier, Rees helped overhaul election funding in the state by introducing a ban on developer donations. But, he said, the idea of publicly funded elections had \u201chit the sand\u201d. \u201cNeither party has an interest in doing it because we\u2019re locked in a funding arms race, and vested interests like the commercial media don\u2019t want to see public funding because it means less ads on television and in newspapers,\u201d he said. This week, Guardian Australia has spoken to a number of current and former Labor officials who have described an often toxic culture within the party\u2019s head office. The structure of the ALP in NSW means that the general secretary of the party is the de facto leader of the right faction, while the left is led by its sole assistant secretary. That often leads to competing priorities \u2013 what\u2019s good for the right isn\u2019t necessarily good for the party and vice versa \u2013 and means there is often a lack of trust within the building. Tales about the petty animosities between the two factions at Sussex Street fill the folklore of Labor in NSW. One general secretary would print screeds of documents when he knew his leftwing assistant needed to use it. Another leftwing assistant secretary had to fight for months to get access to a locked stationery cupboard. \u201cIf you\u2019re from the left you basically know the one assistant secretary in Sussex Street and they\u2019re sitting there surrounded by the enemy, you know,\u201d said Meredith Burgmann, the former president of the NSW parliament upper house and a doyen of the Labor left. . Burgmann said the party\u2019s head office had been unduly focused on raising money and fighting factional wars. A culture of internal promotion, she said, had helped foster that. \u201cThe reality is that for the last few years they\u2019ve been promoting people from inside, which I don\u2019t think has been terribly helpful because if there was a poor culture there it\u2019s just flowed on,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think Kaila Murnain was trying to clean things up, and I think she was horrified by what she was told [by Ernest Wong] but \u2026 she should have known better.\u201d In other words, Murnain is less a cause than a symptom of a wider problem. Removing her won\u2019t fix the root cause of NSW Labor\u2019s malaise. \u201cIf all the previous structures and conditions remain the same, the culture will not change,\u201d Rees said. \u201cThe problem is in the culture. It\u2019s the process of entry into the machine through young Labor and up the totem pole. If you want to change culture, you have to change the pattern of ascension and it has been abundantly clear for some time that the culture has been less than ideal.\u201d Any equivocation about Murnain\u2019s future ended shortly after her evidence on Wednesday. Icac had already heard evidence from one Labor official, Kenrick Cheah, that she had seen the cash-filled Aldi bag at Labor\u2019s headquarters in 2015. Murnain spoke of meeting with a \u201cdistressed\u201d state MP, Ernest Wong, a man who played a critical role in organising the March 2015 fundraising dinner. The pair met out the back of state parliament about 6.45pm on 16 September 2016. Wong was sweating. He was anxious. \u201cHe sort of just blurted out that a donor who had said they\u2019d given money to the Labor party had not actually given money to the Labor party,\u201d Murnain said. She responded: \u201cWhat the shit?\u201d \u201cI remember that. I then asked him a question about who, I just said, \u201cWho donated the money?\u201d And he, he said very quickly, \u2018Mr Huang\u2019.\u201d The next series of events were picked apart forensically by Icac in its hearings. Murnain said she quickly called her mentor and then Labor senator, Sam Dastyari, for advice. From the outside, it appears a strange course of action. Dastyari was in the middle of his own damaging scandal involving Huang\u2019s Yuhu Group, which had paid a legal bill of $5,000 on behalf of the senator. He was also recorded suggesting Australia should remain neutral on the issue of the South China Sea dispute, a stance at odds with Labor policy. This was all taking place just a year after intelligence agencies warned the major political parties that two of Australia\u2019s most generous donors had \u201cstrong connections to the Chinese Communist party\u201d, and in the context of an ongoing NSW Electoral Commission investigation into donation irregularities at the March 2015 fundraiser. Dastyari arrived and picked Murnain up in his car. Murnain says they drove around Sydney together for five to 10 minutes. Dastyari said it was an hour or more. They both recall Dastyari urging her to go to Labor\u2019s lawyer, Ian Robertson, of Holding Redlich. Phone records tabled at Icac show Murnain meeting up with Robertson about 7.18pm, just half an hour after she says she met with Wong. She alleges at the Icac hearing that Robertson told her to keep quiet about what Wong had told her. \u201cIan said to me, \u2018There is no need to do anything from here. Don\u2019t record this meeting, don\u2019t put it in your diary,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Forget the conversation happened with Ernest, and I won\u2019t be billing you for this either\u2026 and don\u2019t tell anyone about it\u2019.\u201d Both Murnain and Dastyari were adamant they only met once that night. But Dastyari\u2019s WhatsApp records show him arranging to meet Murnain at 7.41pm, well after she met with Robertson. Quickly after Murnain\u2019s evidence concluded on Wednesday, she was dumped. The next day, she broke down on the Icac witness stand as she explained why she had followed the advice and kept quiet. \u201cWe\u2019d been through a lot that year,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were multiple court cases ongoing. There were byelections current. I was scared for the office, and the reputation of the party \u2026 I obviously recognise now that\u2019s something I shouldn\u2019t have done.\u201d Many questions remain for Icac when it returns next week. On Friday, Wong was repeatedly accused of lying when he claimed he had not sold the head table at the fundraising dinner to Huang for $100,000, despite records suggesting otherwise. Icac\u2019s counsel assisting, Scott Robertson, warned Wong to use the weekend to think carefully about his evidence. \u201cI\u2019d like you to carefully consider the answers that you\u2019ve given to the commission during the course of today, and in particular, whether you have given truthful answers during the course of this morning. \u201cAnd early on Monday morning, I\u2019m going to ask you whether you adhere to all of the evidence that you gave to me this morning.\u201d The Icac has already claimed the scalp of one major Labor powerbroker.

      "bodyText": "Dior is facing backlash for promoting its perfume line Sauvage with an advertisement featuring Native American imagery. The fashion brand teased the ad, which stars actor Johnny Depp, on Twitter on Friday as \u201can authentic journey deep into the Native American soul in a sacred, founding and secular territory\u201d. It has since deleted the tweet and all references to the campaign on social media. An extended video promoting the $150 fragrance shows Depp walking amid the red rocks of south-western Utah, stacking rocks to mark his path, as a Native American fancy war dancer Canku One Star, a Rosebud Sioux member, performs on cliff and a young woman, portrayed by Canadian actor of First Nations descent Tanaya Beatty, follows Depp from a distance. Depp also whips out a guitar and plays a famous riff by Shawnee guitarist Link Wray. Scholars and critics have responded that the campaign is racist and a clear cut case of appropriation. \u201cIt is so deeply offensive and racist,\u201d said Crystal Echo Hawk, CEO of the media watchdog group IllumiNative. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone in 2019 can think a campaign like this can go down well.\u201d Dior\u2019s Sauvage line of perfumes isn\u2019t new \u2013 it first launched in the 1960s \u2013 but the brand\u2019s continued use of the name alongside Native American imagery has drawn particular criticism. The French name of the fragrance line translates to \u201cwild\u201d or \u201csavage\u201d in English. \u201cThese types of tropes, these types of narratives about Native people as savages they do real harm,\u201d Echo Hawk said. \u201cAnd fuel racism.\u201d \u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh because this drips with irony \u2013 every single aspect of it,\u201d said Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, an environmental and economic justice group. \u201cBut I\u2019m also upset and angry at the same time.\u201d The video \u201cromanticized Native Americans as relics from the past\u201d, Goldtooth said. \u201cIt\u2019s deplorable that Dior thought this was appropriate.\u201d In a press release, the French fashion giant noted that the film was created in collaboration with Native American consultants and the advocacy group Americans for Indian Opportunity, with the aim of \u201cmoving away from clich\u00e9s in order to avoid the cultural appropriation and subversion that so often taints images representing Native peoples\u201d. But Dior\u2019s attempt to work with Native Americans fell short, critics said. \u201cIt feels like they tried to do it \u2018right\u2019 and involved some great people \u2013 but it\u2019s still an ad for a notoriously racist company and a product called \u2018Savage\u2019,\u201d wrote Adrienne Keene, a scholar and founder of the blog Native Appropriations. Depp has previously drawn criticism for his portrayal of Tonto, a Native American character in Disney\u2019s 2013 remake of The Lone Ranger. Dior did not respond directly to a request for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia has announced the creation of a new natural resources ministry, separating it from the energy ministry, while replacing the head of the royal court in a wide-ranging shakeup of the government. As plans for the massive $2 trillion stock market listing of the state-owned oil company Aramco are stepped up, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler and crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has brought in a prominent businessman to head the new ministry of industry and mineral resources. The appointment of Bandar al-Khorayef, who comes into government from the Saudi industrial conglomerate Al-Khorayef Group, was seen as a reduction in influence for the energy minister, Khalid al-Falih. The minister was one of the architects of attempts by the world\u2019s top crude exporter to diversify its oil-reliant economy. Other royal decrees published in state media on Friday named Fahd al-Essa as head of the royal court, the centre of power and politics in the absolute monarchy. The head of the royal court is a powerful gatekeeper position in the absolute monarchy. Essa is a royal insider and is said to be close to the crown prince, who is the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler and heir apparent. Essa was formerly the head of Bin Salman\u2019s office at the defense ministry. A former information minister, Awwad al-Awwad, was appointed head of the human rights commission, while Mazen al-Kahmous was named new chairman of the national anti-corruption commission. The shakeup comes ahead of the first anniversary in October of the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The fallout over the insider-turned-critic\u2019s murder was widely seen as the kingdom\u2019s worst diplomatic crisis since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, in which most of the hijackers were identified as Saudi nationals. The killing tainted the image of Mohammed bin Salman even though the kingdom strongly denies he was involved.",

That isn\u2019t the least bit true, and the Times ought to hire a fact-checker to challenge him on these assertions.

      "bodyText": "More details emerged on the sudden ousting of Madeleine Westerhout, the personal assistant to President Trump. Politico reported that she told reporters at an off-the-record dinner that Trump didn\u2019t like taking pictures with Tiffany Trump because he thought she was overweight, and that he couldn\u2019t pick her out of a crowd. Trump only confirmed that Westerhout had been drinking and made comments about Trump\u2019s children. With Hurricane Dorian approaching, the House Judiciary Committee postponed the gun violence legislation vote. Sleep tight, everyone. Don\u2019t let the Bret Stephens bite. President Trump spent much his campaign for the 2016 election invoking the San Francisco killing of Kate Steinle, who died when she was struck by a ricocheting bullet shot by an undocumented immigrant. The subsequent trial of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate ignited a nationwide debate over immigration and sanctuary laws, but he was acquitted of Steinle\u2019s murder and convicted only of a single count of being a felon in possession of a firearm - he had a criminal history of felony reentry into the country. Today, a California court of appeal overturned that conviction. Can you still subtweet if you deleted your Twitter account? If you\u2019re New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, then the answer is yes. Earlier this week, Stephens had a very public meltdown over a George Washington University associate professor David Karpf calling him a bedbug on Twitter. He deleted his account after sending an email to both the professor and the university provost in an attempt to get the professor in trouble - an email that promptly went viral. That could have been the end of the whole saga. But alas. Stephens took to his column to essentially equate getting called a bedbug on Twitter to the pre-World War II rhetoric that led to the extermination of the Jews. In the ultimate subtweet move, Stephens doesn\u2019t even reference what happened on Twitter - he just casually drops a bedbug quote relating to the burning of Warsaw\u2019s Jewish ghetto, as if him getting called a bedbug is anywhere in the same realm as living as a Jew in Warsaw\u2019s ghetto. \u201cI am surprised and disappointed that he has decided to continue escalating what should have been a silly argument,\u201d Karpf told the Guardian. \u201cBret Stephens does not appear to have the humility to admit that he was having a bad night, overreacted and was wrong.\u201d Karpf continued: \u201cStephens states in his op-ed that eliminationist rhetoric is particularly prominent from the left. That isn\u2019t the least bit true, and the Times ought to hire a fact-checker to challenge him on these assertions. He also says that the most reviled people in American politics are the moderate Republicans...again, this is embarrassingly self-centered and obviously untrue.\u201d (Both Stephens and Karpf are Jewish). Looks like Hurricane Dorian\u2019s effect will stretch beyond the coast: With Hurricane Dorian approaching, President Trump talked to reporters: More on Madeleine Westerhout and her sudden departure: President Trump has confirmed at least part of the Politico report. Madeleine Westerhout, the personal assistant to President Trump, purportedly told reporters that the president did not like taking pictures with his oft-overlooked younger daughter, Tiffany Trump, because he thought she was overweight. According to Politico, this was just one of the comments Westerhout made at an off-the-record dinner at which she \u201chad a couple drinks and in an uncharacteristically unguarded moment...opened up to the reporters\u201d - comments that led to her sudden ousting last week. At this dinner, she also bragged that she had a better relationship with Trump than either of his daughters, and that he couldn\u2019t pick Tiffany out of a crowd. There appeared to have been fireworks at the Flynn hearing over when to set his sentencing date. Hey all, Vivian Ho on the west coast taking over for Joan Greve. Happy Friday before a holiday weekend. Let\u2019s see where the day takes us, shall we? That\u2019s it from me this week. My west coast colleague, Vivian Ho, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump has approved a state of emergency declaration for Florida as the state prepares for the potentially catastrophic arrival of Hurricane Dorian, which has strengthened into a Category 3 storm and may make landfall as a Category 4. Michael Flynn\u2019s lawyers are sparring with federal prosecutors about when he should be sentenced, with the government pushing to hold a hearing by early November. A military judge has set a Jan. 2021 start date for the trial of five men accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks, but significant questions remain about what evidence will be accepted. Another House Republican, John Shimkus, has announced his retirement. He is at least the ninth congressional Republican to announce a departure in recent weeks. Alabama\u2019s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, is facing calls for her resignation over her involvement in a blackface skit over 50 years ago as a college student. Trump has ousted his personal assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, after she gave details to the press about the president\u2019s family and handling of the White House. Vivian will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Have a wonderful and relaxing Labor Day weekend. The departing House Republicans have listed a variety of reasons for their retirements, but it seems clear that the party\u2019s 2018 loss of chamber control is at least one contributing factor. Democrats gained a House majority in 2018 for the first time in eight years, leaving Republican lawmakers with far less power than they previously had. The retirements indicate that congressional Republicans have had a hard time adjusting to the change and don\u2019t expect the pendulum to swing back next year, as a Washington Post reporter noted. Representative John Shimkus, a Republican of Illinois, announced on a local radio program that he does not intend to seek re-election next year. The 12-term congressman won his 2018 election by more than 40 points, so his seat will likely remain in Republican hands. But the news continues a string of retirement announcements among House Republicans in recent weeks. Representative Sean Duffy announced Monday he would leave Congress next month to prepare for the arrival of his ninth child, who has a heart condition. Duffy was at least the eighth Republican congressman to announce a departure in recent weeks. Donald Trump Jr is the subject of a new round of Twitter mockery after the president\u2019s eldest son headlined a very poorly attended rally in Kentucky. Trump spoke at the rally in support of the state\u2019s Republican governor, Matt Bevin, who is facing a tough re-election this November. The venue for the event, Appalachian Wireless Arena, can hold 7,000 people, but only a couple hundred showed up for the rally. The communications director for the liberal group American Bridge noted that attendance might have been affected by Bevin\u2019s low popularity in the state. The dismal optics of the event delighted liberal commentators, who are hoping Democrats can win multiple statewide races there this year despite Kentucky\u2019s status as a Republican stronghold. The intelligence community, along with the White House, appeared unable to elaborate on this tweet Trump sent a couple of hours ago. The CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred reporters\u2019 questions about the tweet to the White House. But when asked about the matter, the White House said it had no further comment. A former adviser to Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council noted that the tweet could raise concerns if the image was originally classified. A military judge has set Jan. 11, 2021, as the start date for the trial at Guant\u00e1namo Bay of five men accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks. The New York Times reports: The date set by the judge, Col. W. Shane Cohen of the Air Force, signals the start of the selection of a military jury at Camp Justice, the war court convening at the Navy base in Cuba. It is the first time that a trial judge in the case actually set a start-of-trial date, despite requests by prosecutors since 2012 to two earlier judges to do so. If the 2021 timeline holds, jury selection would start nine months before the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. One major issue the judge has yet to resolve is what evidence will be used at trial. He begins a series of hearings next month with witnesses in an effort by the defense teams to exclude confessions the defendants made to F.B.I. agents in early 2006 as tainted by the years of C.I.A. torture. As Florida prepares for the potentially catastrophic arrival of Hurricane Dorian, Trump has turned his attention to the important matter of James Comey and the former FBI director\u2019s memos. The DOJ inspector general released its report on the matter yesterday, concluding that Comey had violated DOJ and FBI policies by sharing the memos detailing his interactions with Trump. Bur the watchdog crucially found no evidence that Comey had disclosed the contents of the memo to the media, contradicting Trump\u2019s repeated claims that the former FBI chief was a \u201cleaker.\u201d The president appears to be ignoring that latter point, though, in favor of casting the report as a \u201cscathing\u201d rebuke of Comey. Trump has tweeted about the report four times in the past hour or so, while remaining silent about the strengthening hurricane preparing to strike Florida. The president cancelled his planned trip to Poland this weekend, ostensibly so that he could better track the hurricane\u2019s progress. But his Twitter feed bears no reflection of that. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who ended her presidential bid earlier this week, has set a goal of raising $1 million for women candidates in 2020. \u201cI\u2019ve said it for months, and I\u2019ll say it again today: Women are on fire in America. We\u2019re speaking up, marching, running for office, and winning in historic numbers,\u201d the New York Democrat wrote on Twitter. \u201cAnd this is just the beginning. Now let\u2019s go elect some more women.\u201d When she dropped out of the race, Gillibrand chose not to endorse another candidate, but she implied a woman would make an excellent nominee. \u201cI think that women have a unique ability to bring people together and heal this country,\u201d she told the New York Times. \u201cI think a woman nominee would be inspiring and exciting.\u201d New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, is sending 25 members of the FDNY Incident Management Team to Florida to assist with Hurricane Dorian preparations. \u201cNew York City is ready to do whatever it takes to help those impacted by Hurricane Dorian,\u201d de Blasio said in a statement. \u201cWe are actively monitoring the situation in Florida and the FDNY Incident Management team will be assisting and coordinating with local first responders to ensure they have the support they need in the coming days.\u201d Meanwhile, Dorian continues to strengthen in the Atlantic Ocean, where it has become a Category 3 storm. It may strike Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds of up to 156 mph. The federal judge overseeing Michael Flynn\u2019s case, Emmet Sullivan, appeared inclined to go along with prosecutors\u2019 accelerated timeline for sentencing the former national security adviser. Flynn\u2019s lawyers are insisting they are not prepared for a hearing, arguing they have been denied access to information that would be crucial in determining their client\u2019s sentence. They asked for \u201ca significant amount of time\u201d to clear up the matter. But federal prosecutors pushed back against that request. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s cooperation has ended. The case is ready for sentencing, and the government proposes the following dates for a sentencing hearing: October 21-23, 2019, or November 1-15, 2019,\u201d they wrote in their filing to Sullivan. \u201cThe government is not aware of any issues that require the Court\u2019s resolution prior to sentencing.\u201d The judge seems to agree. He quickly approved prosecutors\u2019 request to hold a Sept. 10 conference to discuss the dispute, even though Flynn\u2019s lawyers said they would not be available on that date. The chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, Troy Price, said at a press conference that the state\u2019s February caucus would occur as planned despite the Democratic National Committee scrapping the virtual option for voters. But he acknowledged that state officials were still grappling with the repercussions of the DNC\u2019s decision. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Price said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this news like everyone else.\u201d Still, Price assured those present that Iowa would maintain its first voting state status. He said: \u201cJust know this: On Feb. 3, 2020 caucuses will take place in this state. Iowa will be first.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro is criticizing the Democratic National Committee for moving to scrap virtual caucuses in Iowa and Nevada over hacking concerns. Castro also warned in a statement that the move would \u201cdisenfranchise tens of thousands of voters\u201d and potentially decrease turnout in Iowa by up to a third. The committee\u2019s decision leaves Iowa with little time to come up with an alternative virtual option for voters by the time of the state\u2019s Feb. 3 caucus. Trump\u2019s press secretary announced in a statement that the president will welcome the emir of Kuwait to the White House on Sept. 12. \u201cThe visit will build on the longstanding partnership between the United States and Kuwait and further strengthen our substantial economic and security ties,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe two leaders are expected to discuss regional developments, bilateral security cooperation, and counterterrorism issues.\u201d The emir, Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, last visited the White House in Sept. 2018 to discuss the blockade of Kuwait\u2019s Gulf neighbor, Qatar, over its alleged support of terrorism. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Lawyers for Michael Flynn said in a report to the judge overseeing his case that the former national security adviser had completed his cooperation with the government. But they are pushing back on prosecutors\u2019 request to hold a sentencing hearing by early November. Trump approved a state of emergency declaration for Florida as it prepares for the arrival of Hurricane Dorian, which has strengthened in the western Atlantic. The president ousted his personal assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, for talking to the press about his family and his handling of the White House. The Democratic National Committee is expected to scrap Iowa and Nevada\u2019s plans to hold virtual caucuses due to hacking concerns. The Guardian is continuing to cover hurricane preparations and Greta Thunberg\u2019s climate protest, so stay tuned. Bernie Sanders criticized Joe Biden\u2019s climate proposals after the former vice president called out the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of methane regulations. During the last Democratic debate, Biden was confronted by Jay Inslee, who has since dropped out of the race, about whether his climate plan went far enough. \u201cLook these deadlines are set by science,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cMr. Vice President, your argument is not with me, it\u2019s with science. And unfortunately your plan is just too late.\u201d Biden responded by touting the merits of his plan, such as a proposed expansion of wind energy, but he was vague about whether his administration would end fracking. \u201cWe will work it out,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe will make sure it\u2019s eliminated and no more subsidies for either of those, any fossil fuels.\u201d Alabama\u2019s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, apologized for wearing blackface in a skit as an Auburn University student more than 50 years ago. Ivey discussed the skit in a recorded conversation with her then-fiance. The governor said in a statement addressing the incident, \u201cEven after listening to the tape, I sincerely do not recall either the skit, which evidently occurred at a Baptist Student Union party, or the interview itself, both which occurred 52 years ago.\u201d She added: \u201cEven though Ben is the one on tape remembering the skit \u2014 and I still don\u2019t recall ever dressing up in overalls or in blackface \u2014 I will not deny what is the obvious. As such, I fully acknowledge \u2014 with genuine remorse \u2014 my participation in a skit like that back when I was a senior in college. \u201cWhile some may attempt to excuse this as acceptable behavior for a college student during the mid-1960s, that is not who I am today, and it is not what my Administration represents all these years later.\u201d Alabama Republicans have urged constituents to accept Ivey\u2019s apology, while some Democrats in the state are calling for her resignation. Ivey is only the latest politician to come under scrutiny for a past incident involving blackface. Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, faced calls for his resignation after a blackface photo was uncovered on his medical school yearbook page. He remains in office. Meanwhile, the US currently has no black governors in office. Hurricane Dorian is building strength in the western Atlantic as it prepares to unleash potentially catastrophic damage on Florida. Tom McCarthy has the latest: Emergency preparations were under way up and down the Atlantic coast, from Jacksonville in the north to Miami and the Florida Keys, as well as in Orlando and inland areas. On Friday morning, Dorian was a category 2 hurricane located north-east of the Bahamas, with maximum sustained winds of 110mph. Ominously, the storm had developed a distinct eye and slowed its westward progress, meaning it could spend more time over land \u2013 and do more damage. Meteorologists said Dorian could make landfall in Florida on Tuesday as a category 4 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 140mph. \u2018If it makes landfall as a category 3 or 4 hurricane, that\u2019s a big deal,\u2019 University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy told the Associated Press. \u2018A lot of people are going to be affected. A lot of insurance claims.\u2019 The White House issued a statement that Trump has approved declaring a state of emergency in Florida as Hurricane Dorian approaches. \u201cToday, President Donald J. Trump declared that an emergency exists in the State of Florida and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from Hurricane Dorian beginning on August 28, 2019, and continuing,\u201d the statement read. Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center warned that Florida residents could start seeing the storm\u2019s effects as early as Sunday morning. Fox News host Neil Cavuto lambasted Trump\u2019s implication earlier this week that the network should be \u201cworking\u201d for him. The president tweeted on Wednesday, \u201cWe have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d Cavuto criticized the comments in his closing monologue last night. \u201cMr. President, we don\u2019t work for you. I don\u2019t work for you,\u201d the host said. \u201cMy job is to cover you, not fawn over you or rip you. Just report on you.\u201d Cavuto has previously called out Trump for dismissing negative coverage of his administration as \u201cfake news.\u201d \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re a liar,\u201d he said last year amid reports of the payment to Stormy Daniels. \u201cYou\u2019re the president. You\u2019re busy. I\u2019m just having a devil of a time figuring out which news is fake. Let\u2019s just say your own words on lots of stuff give me, shall I say, lots of pause.\u201d But one former adviser to Barack Obama mocked the idea of a Fox News host trying to get some distance from Trump, given all of the fawning coverage the network has showered on the president. Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden, has joined a protest outside the United Nations headquarters in New York to demand action on the climate crisis. Thunberg arrived in New York on Wednesday after crossing the Atlantic via a solar-powered yacht. She told the Guardian after completing her journey: \u201cIt\u2019s insane that a 16-year-old has to cross the Atlantic in order to take a stand, but that\u2019s how it is. It feels like we are at a breaking point. Leaders know that more eyes on them, much more pressure is on them, that they have to do something, they have to come up with some sort of solution. I want a concrete plan, not just nice words.\u201d The Democratic National Committee is expected to recommend scrapping the proposed virtual caucuses in Iowa and Nevada over security concerns. The AP reports: The final choice whether to allow virtual caucuses in Iowa and Nevada is up to the party\u2019s powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee. But opposition from DNC\u2019s executive and staff leadership makes it highly unlikely the committee would keep the virtual caucuses, leaving two key early voting states and the national party a short time to fashion an alternative before the February caucuses. The state parties had planned to allow some voters to cast caucus votes over the telephone in February 2020 instead of showing up at traditional caucus meetings. Iowa and Nevada created the virtual option to meet a DNC mandate that states open caucuses to more people, but two sources with knowledge of party leaders\u2019 deliberations say there are concerns that the technology used for virtual caucuses could be subject to hacking. Flynn\u2019s lawyers are arguing that they need more time to review his case and that his sentencing should be delayed accordingly. \u201cThe case is not ready for sentencing,\u201d Flynn\u2019s lawyers wrote in a report to the US District Court judge in the case, Emmet Sullivan. They argued they had been denied access to pertinent information \u201cthat is either classified or being suppressed by the government.\u201d \u201cWe must have access to that information to represent our client consistently with his constitutional rights and our ethical obligations,\u201d the lawyers wrote. But federal prosecutors say they are ready to close the case on Flynn, who was originally supposed to be sentenced in December. They have proposed a sentencing hearing between either October 21 and 23 or November 1 and 15. James R. Leavelle, a former Dallas detective who appeared in the famous photograph of Jack Ruby shooting and killing Lee Harvey Oswald, has died at 99. The New York Times reports: Mr. Leavelle, a veteran Dallas homicide detective who had survived the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, was handcuffed to Mr. Oswald and was leading him through a police station basement on Nov. 24, 1963, when Mr. Ruby, a nightclub owner, stepped out of the crowd and pumped a fatal bullet into the prisoner. The shooting, with Mr. Oswald\u2019s pained grimace and Detective Leavelle\u2019s stricken glower, was chillingly captured by Robert H. Jackson of The Dallas Times Herald in an iconic photograph that won the Pulitzer Prize the following year. Moments earlier, he and Mr. Oswald had had an eerie exchange, Mr. Leavelle often later recounted. \u2018Lee,\u2019 he recalled saying, \u2018if anybody shoots at you, I hope they are as good a shot as you.\u2019 To which, he said, Mr. Oswald replied: \u2018You\u2019re being melodramatic.\u2019 At the time, two days after President Kennedy had been gunned down in a motorcade through downtown Dallas, Mr. Oswald was a suspect in the killing of a Dallas police officer, J.D. Tippit, and had yet to be conclusively tied to the assassination. But after Detective Leavelle asked him whether he had shot the police officer, Mr. Oswald aroused the detective\u2019s suspicions by insisting, \u2018I didn\u2019t shoot anybody,\u2019 as if, Mr. Leavelle later recounted, there had been another shooting as well. Flynn raised some red flags earlier this year, when the former national security adviser fired his lawyers and hired a fierce FBI critic in their place. Politico reported back in June: Flynn has a new attorney: former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell, one of the earliest and fiercest critics of the Justice Department and the FBI\u2019s investigation into a potential conspiracy between President Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. The move appears to signal a shift in posture, if not in strategy: Powell, a former Justice Department attorney who has written extensively about overzealous prosecutors, has claimed that Flynn was spied on as part of a \u2018set-up\u2019 by the FBI, and that his entire case should be \u2018dismissed,\u2019 taking a far more aggressive public stance than Flynn\u2019s previous lawyers, Robert Kelner and Stephen Anthony, ever did. Flynn, who fired Kelner and Anthony last week, awaits sentencing for lying to the FBI about his conversations with former Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the transition period. Michael Flynn, who served as Trump\u2019s national security adviser, has completed his cooperation with federal prosecutors, according to a new court filing. The government said it was hoping to sentence Flynn, who was charged with lying to the FBI about his conversations with a Russian official, by early November. But Flynn\u2019s legal team appeared hesitant about that timeline. The Guardian is also tracking the progress of Hurricane Dorian, which is expected to become the worst storm to hit Florida\u2019s east coast in more than 25 years. Tom McCarthy and Joanna Walters have more: Hurricane Dorian is likely to affect the state directly overnight Sunday, with the latest computer modeling predicting it will make landfall in the early hours of Monday, the Labor Day holiday in the US, around West Palm Beach. But weather experts on Thursday proclaimed the state\u2019s entire east coast at risk. The tempest on Friday was threatening to become the most powerful hurricane to affect the east coast of Florida since Hurricane Andrew roared ashore in 1992, causing devastating damage and killing 65 people. A state of emergency has been declared and Donald Trump has canceled his forthcoming trip this weekend to Poland as the storm approaches. The president warned the storm was an \u2018absolute monster\u2019. Millions of Floridians on Friday were stockpiling water, food, fuel and materials such as plywood to board up properties. They have been advised to track the storm closely. The Trump administration is exploring how to act on the president\u2019s unfounded claims after mass shootings that more mental institutions would minimize such tragedies. The AP reports: When back-to-back mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, jolted the nation earlier this month, Trump again spoke of \u2018building new facilities\u2019 for the mentally ill as a way to reduce mass shootings. \u2018We don\u2019t have those institutions anymore and people can\u2019t get proper care,\u2019 Trump lamented at a New Hampshire campaign rally not long after the latest shootings. Now, in response to Trump\u2019s concerns, White House staff members are looking for ways to incorporate the president\u2019s desire for more institutions into a long list of other measures aimed at reducing gun violence. It\u2019s the latest example of White House policy aides scrambling to come up with concrete policies or proposals to fill out ideas tossed out by the president. And it\u2019s an idea that mental health professionals say reflects outdated thinking on the treatment of mental illness. After the shootings in El Paso and Dayton earlier this month, the American Psychological Association put out a statement criticizing those who tried to connect the violence to mental illness. \u201cRoutinely blaming mass shootings on mental illness is unfounded and stigmatizing,\u201d said Rosie Phillips Davis, the APA\u2019s president. \u201cResearch has shown that only a very small percentage of violent acts are committed by people who are diagnosed with, or in treatment for, mental illness.\u201d Happy Friday, live blog readers! It appears that the Trump White House\u2019s high turnover rate has claimed another victim: the president\u2019s personal assistant, Madeleine Westerhout. Westerhout has been with Donald Trump since his inauguration and has enjoyed extensive access to the president. Responsible for controlling the flow of traffic into the Oval Office, she also held a unique power, given Trump\u2019s tendency to have his opinion be swayed by the last person he spoke to. But all of that was forgotten when she spoke to reporters at an off-the-record dinner about the president\u2019s office and his family. The New York Times reports: Ms. Westerhout\u2019s abrupt and unexpected departure came after Mr. Trump learned on Thursday that she had indiscreetly shared details about his family and the Oval Office operations she was part of at a recent off-the-record dinner with reporters staying at hotels near Bedminster, N.J., during the president\u2019s working vacation, according to one of the people, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss White House personnel issues. The breach of trust meant immediate action: Ms. Westerhout, one of the people familiar with her departure said, was now considered a \u2018separated employee\u2019 and would not be allowed to return to the White House on Friday. Westerhout could have learned from James Comey\u2019s memos detailing his interactions with Trump: this president demands absolute loyalty. And those who don\u2019t offer it risk suffering a very unceremonious end to their public service. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: Trump will have lunch with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and later depart for Camp David. Joe Biden has no public events on his campaign schedule as the Democratic presidential candidate grapples with the fallout of telling an apparently false war story on the trail. Multiple other 2020 Democrats, including Bernie Sanders, are campaigning in South Carolina today. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

While Indonesia and its resource-rich spice islands were granted independence from the Netherlands in 1949, West Papua, then known as West Irian, remained under Dutch control until Indonesian troops parachuted in to \u201cliberate\u201d it in 1962. By August that year the territory was temporarily bought under Indonesian control. In 1969, the controversial Act of Free Choice, a vote to enable the inhabitants of West Irian to determine their own future, was held. Many Papuans claim it was conducted under duress. Of a population of 800,000 people, some 1,022 Papuans, reportedly hand-picked by Jakarta and kept under military supervision, unanimously voted for integration. Despite concerns over the process, the United Nations noted the results in Resolution No. 2504, without explicitly endorsing them. In the minds of West Papua\u2019s pro-independence leaders the sense of disenfranchisement that characterised the Act of Free Choice has lingered in the Papuan psyche, fuelling a sense of injustice and perpetuating an independence movement that refuses to go away. \u2018Papuans want freedom\u2019 Across the Papuan capital, Jayapura, storefronts are adorned with red and white, the colours of the Indonesian flag, decorations from Indonesian independence day celebrations on 17 August. But deep-seated nationalism is hard to find. \u201cIndonesian nationalism is only a symbol in Papua, a symbol that is forced upon us,\u201d scoffs Victor Yeimo, \u201cHow can we say we are part of Indonesia when we have never had a choice?\u201d Filep Karma, a prominent independence figure who spent eleven years in jail for flying the banned Morning Star flag, sits on the balcony of his Jayapura home, wearing a camel safari suit, and an East Timorese flag on his cap. The independence symbols, he says, are \u201chis motivations\u201d. \u201cSometimes in town the military threatens me and says \u2018take off that pin\u2019,\u201d he says of his Morning Star flag badge, \u201cI tell them, \u2018shoot me first, then you can take it off,\u201d he says with a laugh. For years Karma says he has warned the Indonesian government about its racism problem, an issue that many Papuans know all to well. As a student in Java, Karma recalls a female friend who was a good singer cracking a joke in front of their friends. If they ever married, she jibed, \u201call the monkeys [Papuans] would know how to sing\u201d. \u201cIt hit me in the heart,\u201d says Karma, from the balcony of his Jayapura home. \u201cIn church we would say we were brothers, so how could anyone say that?\u201d In Indonesia the general view of Papuans, he says, is \u201cpeople with black skin, curly hair, and hairy bodies\u201d who are \u201cstupid, stinky and criminal\u201d. Encountering it on a daily basis, he added, \u201cgets to you psychologically\u201d. Around Jayapura, banners have been strung up calling for people to reject all forms of racism, but other ethnic divisions are plainly visible. At the Jayapura Mall, almost all patrons and salespeople are noticeably non-Papuan. The indigenous Papuans can be found clustered outside in the heat, selling betel nut and woven bags on the pavement. Papua is a land rich in natural resources, but the indigenous population complain they have not benefited enough from their natural wealth \u2013 across the country Papua has the highest rates of illiteracy and HIV. President Joko Widodo, or \u201cJokowi\u201d, has worked hard to develop Papua, regularly visiting and initiating new infrastructure projects. But there have been bitter disappointments too. In 2014 Jokowi promised to solve egregious cases of human rights abuses, but critics say nothing has changed and for many Papuans, getting justice is more important than a new bridge or road. \u201cThe government needs a humanitarian approach, not a military one if they want to win the hearts of Papuans,\u201d remarked Marinus Yaung, a lecturer in international relations Cendrawasih University in Jayapura. On the ground the issue of a referendum on self-determination is a sensitive one to for Papuans, who worry there could be repercussions for what they say. At a traditional market one woman answered carefully. \u201cPapuans are happy with Jokowi,\u201d she said, \u201cBut it should be our right to choose.\u201d One local journalist who asked not to be named told the Guardian: \u201cIf you ask Papuans if they want freedom, they do.\u201d Even as the anger in Papua boils over, analysts say it is hard to see how much could change without significant international pressure and support \u2013 something that has been lacking for decades and shows little sign of materialising now. To Jakarta\u2019s elite, which vehemently maintains Papua is a legitimate and non-negotiable part of Indonesia, independence for West Papua remains a fanciful suggestion.On Thursday, chief security minister Wiranto said the government would not entertain any demand for an independence vote, according to Kompas.com. \u201cDemands for referendum I think must not be mentioned. Why? Because the unity of the Republic of Indonesia is final,\u201d Wiranto said. Karma is used to Jakarta\u2019s intransigence and is realistic about Papuan dreams of independence:\u201cPapua belongs to them, but in our minds it is ours.\u201d",
