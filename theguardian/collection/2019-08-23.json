      "bodyText": "A new US government plan had cleared the way for coal mining and oil and gas drilling on land stripped from Utah\u2019s Grand Staircase-Escalante monument by the Trump administration two years ago. The plan, released by the Bureau of Land Management on Friday, would also open more lands to cattle grazing and recreation and acknowledges there could be \u201cadverse effects\u201d on land and resources in the monument. Trump drastically shrank the southern Utah monument in 2017, as well as the nearby Bears Ears national monument, in what represented the largest elimination of public lands protections in US history. Some 800,000 acres were removed from the Grand Staircase. The move was widely condemned by conservation and paleontology groups, who have filed ongoing lawsuits challenging Trump\u2019s authority to downsize the monument. They say the new BLM plan lacks adequate protections for the land and reiterated their concern that the years spent creating the plan were a waste of taxpayer resources because the lawsuits remain unresolved. Steve Bloch, the legal director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance conservation group, said it was unforgivable to cut the monument in half and downgrade the excluded lands to what he calls \u201cgarden variety public lands\u201d. \u201cGrand Staircase-Escalante is one of the nation\u2019s public land crown jewels and from the outset the Trump administration was hell-bent on destroying this place,\u201d Bloch said. The allowance for coal, oil and gas extraction on the lands cut was expected as the Trump administration carried out a \u201creckless\u201d plan to undo protections on pristine lands, said Heidi McIntosh, the managing attorney of Earthjustice\u2019s Rocky Mountains office. \u201cFirst, they ripped it in half and now they are officially opening the door to all kinds of destructive activities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a giveaway to the fossil fuel industry.\u201d Harry Barber, the acting manager of the national monument, stressed that protections would remain even though the lands were no longer within the monument. \u201cIt\u2019s not a free-for-all,\u201d Barber said. \u201cThat seems to be what I hear a lot, people feeling like now anybody can go out and do anything they want to do on these lands. But, they need to realize that we still have our rules and policies.\u201d The monument has seen a 63% increase in visitors over the past decade, hosting 1.1m people from October 2017 through September 2018, according to US government figures. The BLM plan would add a few safeguards for the cliffs, canyons, waterfalls and arches still inside Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument that weren\u2019t in a proposed plan issued last year. Among them are opening fewer acres to ATVs and cancelling a plan that would have allowed people to collect some non-dinosaur fossils in certain areas. Barber told the Associated Press the plan reflects changes made after considering input from the public and considering an assessment that there are enough protections already in place. \u201cThere are people who graze livestock, people that like to hunt, people that like to hike, people that like to trail run,\u201d said Barber, who has worked at the monument since it was created. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be fair.\u201d The plan is expected to go into effect after a public review period. Thus far, market dynamics have limited interest in a large coal reserve found in the now unprotected lands. But an economic analysis estimates coal production could lead to $208m in annual revenues and $16.6m in royalties for the US government. Oil and gas wells in that area could produce $4.1m in annual revenues, it says.

The North had been expected to halt weapons tests because 10-day joint US-South Korean military exercises ended earlier this week. Pyongyang regards these drills as an invasion rehearsal.

Council members said South Korea will launch diplomatic efforts to make North Korea return to nuclear talks with the United States, according to the president\u2019s office. The launch comes after Pyongyang made a scathing attack on Friday on US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, calling him a \u201cdiehard toxin\u201d following the US diplomat\u2019s comment that the US would continue the \u201ctoughest\u201d sanctions on the North until the reclusive state denuclearised. Foreign minister Ri Yong Ho also called Pompeo a \u201cpoisonous plant of American diplomacy\u201d and vowed to \u201cshutter the absurd dream\u201d that sanctions will force a change in Pyongyang.

      "bodyText": "It all started on Monday when Fraser Harvey walked into his local cafe in Melbourne\u2019s city centre. To mark his constant visits to the Sensory Lab outlet on Collins Street, he put up a small poster that crowned him as its favourite customer. But what began as a fairly uncontroversial, albeit quirky, statement soon became a quest, then an obsession, which has so far involved a projector, bespoke loyalty cards, custom uniforms \u2013 and after new developments late on Friday afternoon, a permanent tattoo. Two hours after Harvey put up his picture, he returned to find someone had usurped him. A framed certificate claimed an anonymous rival was \u201cCustomer of the week (Every week)\u201d. It was just the first of many shocks for Harvey, in what has become a week-long battle with an unstoppable foe who refuses to give up. In an escalating series of antics, Harvey returned with his own frame \u2013 an even bigger one. But then his tormenter-in-chief obtained equipment to project her face over the entire store. On Thursday Harvey told Guardian Australia he had finally put a stop to the madness \u2013 by printing cards for the Fraser Harvey Memorial Coffee Loyalty Programme, and crafting shirts for the staff with his face on them. The Melbourne resident declared victory and said he hoped this brought an end to the shenanigans. \u201cI think that I can speak on behalf of the staff too when I say that I am certainly No 1 now,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are asking me why it\u2019s a memorial program when I\u2019m still alive. It\u2019s gravitas. Really commands the respect of the other customers.\u201d The saga has delighted onlookers \u2013 both in person and online \u2013 but Harvey said he still knew nothing about his rival. \u201cWe have never met, but I\u2019m sure it would be incredibly thrilling for her to meet Sensory Lab\u2019s No 1 customer,\u201d he said. But on Friday Fraser\u2019s foe unveiled her masterstroke \u2013 a permanent tattoo of a Sensory Lab coffee cup. Revealing her identity as Harriet Noall \u2013 an urban planner who works above the cafe \u2013 she told Guardian Australia she was now clearly the cafe\u2019s favourite customer. The founder of Sensory Lab, Salvatore Malatesta, said that in his 25 years in hospitality, the rivalry was \u201cthe most exciting thing I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d \u2013 and no hoax. \u201cWhen I first saw it, I thought it was two creative agencies setting each other up,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cOr I thought they must know each other, they work in the same office. But they\u2019ve never met.\u201d Noall said she was just a coffee fan who worked above the shop. \u201cI go down there twice a day for a coffee. The staff are amazing, we have hung out outside of work before.

I thought that might have been the end of it, but I had this overwhelming urge to one-up him once again.\u201d Noall hatched the plan on Thursday, and booked in an emergency session with a tattoo artist who was a friend of a Sensory Lab barista. She described the 6cm tattoo on her ribs as \u201cinsanely painful\u201d. \u201cIt is absolutely real. It hurts. [Proof is in] the fact that my tattoo is bleeding profusely.\u201d Guardian Australia has obtained additional photo evidence that shows the tattoo bleeding. The tattooist, Myles Paten of Yokai City tattoo parlour, confirmed it was real. Harvey has not yet responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment on the tattoo but he did send a tweet that hinted at defeat. Earlier, the Melburnian said he had been \u201churt\u201d when he walked into the cafe on Monday to see the visage of his antagonist projected on to the wall. Malatesta was able to shed more light: \u201cCustomers were weirding the fuck out. Because she wheeled in that projector. She was there, you know, trying to get her face exactly where she wanted it.

It was also pointed out that the Trump administration has worked to chip away at trans rights \u2013 by, for example, supporting so-called \u201cbathroom bills\u201d and banning trans military members \u2013 under Spicer\u2019s tenure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/19/queer-eye-season-four-review-netflix\">Queer Eye season four review \u2013 Jonathan Van Ness for president!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Brown was not open to the criticism. He deleted his entire Twitter feed overnight after responding to a handful of critics in since-deleted tweets.</p> <p>His Queer Eye cast-mate Bobby Berk expressed his sympathy and support for Karamo on Twitter this morning before quickly deleting the tweets. A screenshot of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blackmon/status/1164926786939101184?s=20\">tweets</a> shows the <em> </em>designer saying: \u201cI\u2019m very saddened by what my castmate @Karamo is having to deal with \u2026 When backed in a corner about voicing his opinions about @SeanSpicer Karamo\u2019s media training kicked in.\u201d</p> <p>Berk also attacked ABC for politicizing Dancing with the Stars and giving Spicer a platform. \u201cIt\u2019s called Dancing with the STARS and that fact that you\u2019re calling him a star is disgusting.\u201d</p> <p>The fight is part of a larger issue. Spicer has repeatedly been embraced by segments of the entertainment industry and academia, from appearing at the Emmys<em> </em>to taking a position at Harvard.</p> <p>Prominent queer voices online have been quick to note that this is not Brown\u2019s first time coming out in questionable defense of Republican figures. During an appearance on the podcast <a href=\"https://crooked.com/podcast/the-queer-world/\">Keep It!</a>,<em> </em>Brown talked at length about wanting to see Donald Trump and his administration do well. \u201cI did not vote for President Trump but I do need him to succeed at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to listen and love the people that hate us.\u201d Brown faced pushback from the host, Ira Madison III, a queer black man, and listeners after the podcast.<strong> </strong>The discord provided a brief glimpse at the pressure black entertainment figures face to be a voice for the entire black community and never make missteps. This is true for almost all popular figures of marginalized identities: a silent pressure to be a \u201cmodel minority\u201d \u2013 to an audience of millions.</p> <p>The pushback Karamo is facing shows a \u201cmeet in the middle point\u201d approach simply does not cut it in 2019, even in the space of a seemingly innocuous show like Dancing with the Stars. Berk was right to critique ABC for politicizing the show and blindsiding Brown, but in our current state of affairs, everything is political and resistance is vital at all times.</p> <p>There\u2019s your free media training.</p>",

Fans were quick to point out the harm Spicer had inflicted on the LGBTQ community and scores of other minorities. It was also pointed out that the Trump administration has worked to chip away at trans rights \u2013 by, for example, supporting so-called \u201cbathroom bills\u201d and banning trans military members \u2013 under Spicer\u2019s tenure. But Brown was not open to the criticism. He deleted his entire Twitter feed overnight after responding to a handful of critics in since-deleted tweets. His Queer Eye cast-mate Bobby Berk expressed his sympathy and support for Karamo on Twitter this morning before quickly deleting the tweets. A screenshot of the tweets shows the designer saying: \u201cI\u2019m very saddened by what my castmate @Karamo is having to deal with \u2026 When backed in a corner about voicing his opinions about @SeanSpicer Karamo\u2019s media training kicked in.\u201d Berk also attacked ABC for politicizing Dancing with the Stars and giving Spicer a platform. \u201cIt\u2019s called Dancing with the STARS and that fact that you\u2019re calling him a star is disgusting.\u201d The fight is part of a larger issue. Spicer has repeatedly been embraced by segments of the entertainment industry and academia, from appearing at the Emmys to taking a position at Harvard. Prominent queer voices online have been quick to note that this is not Brown\u2019s first time coming out in questionable defense of Republican figures. During an appearance on the podcast Keep It!, Brown talked at length about wanting to see Donald Trump and his administration do well. \u201cI did not vote for President Trump but I do need him to succeed at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to listen and love the people that hate us.\u201d Brown faced pushback from the host, Ira Madison III, a queer black man, and listeners after the podcast. The discord provided a brief glimpse at the pressure black entertainment figures face to be a voice for the entire black community and never make missteps. This is true for almost all popular figures of marginalized identities: a silent pressure to be a \u201cmodel minority\u201d \u2013 to an audience of millions. The pushback Karamo is facing shows a \u201cmeet in the middle point\u201d approach simply does not cut it in 2019, even in the space of a seemingly innocuous show like Dancing with the Stars. Berk was right to critique ABC for politicizing the show and blindsiding Brown, but in our current state of affairs, everything is political and resistance is vital at all times. There\u2019s your free media training.",

      "body": "<p>When the Swans host the Saints on Saturday afternoon the rainbow flag will fly at the SCG to mark the AFL\u2019s fourth Pride game. This celebration \u2013 one of a number of themed games in the AFL fixture that champions messages of inclusion and diversity \u2013 specifically provides an opportunity to acknowledge the impact Pride has on the football community.</p> <p>In the decades before the AFLW launched, the torch of women\u2019s football was kept alight by dedicated and passionate football-loving women. The women\u2019s game was largely invisible to the larger football community, but the clubs they created were inclusive and safe spaces for many queer identifying women.</p> <p>One such club is the Darebin Falcons Women\u2019s Sports Club. The Falcons are considered a powerhouse in the history of the women\u2019s game. Three former Falcons players came together at a recent event called Pride: Our Untold Stories of Women\u2019s Football to discuss the legacy of queer women on football and the role they played in creating a unique football culture which would lay the foundations for the AFLW competition.</p> <p><strong>Patty Kinnersly</strong> is the CEO of Our Watch, a Carlton Football Club board member and was named in the Darebin Falcons silver jubilee team. <strong>Julia Chiera</strong> is currently an assistant coach in the VFLW and during the AFLW season the welfare manager for the Carlton AFLW team. Carlton player <strong>Darcy Vescio </strong>is one of the faces of the AFLW competition. <strong>Emma Race</strong>, who moderated the discussion, is an Our Watch Fellowship recipient and a member of the Outer Sanctum podcast team.</p> <p><strong>ER</strong>: Patty, in the late 1990s your Ballarat footy team disbanded and you joined the Darebin Falcons. What impressed you about the club?</p> <p><strong>PK</strong>: I saw it as a club with an inclusive and respectful culture. The Falcons were one of the first demonstrations of feminist leadership and governance I saw as a young person and it sparked something in me. We were women excited to play footy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They were a group who didn\u2019t worry about how people looked, where they came from, how many tattoos they had or how bad their mullet was</p> <footer> <cite>Patty Kinnersly</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>ER</strong>: Why were queer women able to lead a space like this?</p> <p><strong>PK</strong>: I suspect this had to do with growing up and not being as impacted by the gender stereotype of being feminine or feeling pressure to behave in a certain way to seek approval from men. Also, knowing you are different, you grow up with a heightened sense of compassion and understanding of people who are seen as different. You grow up understanding what discrimination is and how important it is to create the space for other people \u201cjust to be\u201d.</p> <p><strong>ER</strong>: The Falcons were a powerful club in culture and professionalism. What contributed to that power?</p> <p><strong>PK</strong>: They were a group who didn\u2019t worry about how people looked, where they came from, how many tattoos they had or how bad their mullet was. None of that mattered. It was all about what you brought, how you behaved and treating each other with respect. As a women\u2019s only club there was no scrutiny or worrying what the men thought. This was always a club where you were just free to be. It was compelling.</p> <p><strong>ER</strong>: Would women\u2019s football have survived from the 1980s onwards if queer women didn\u2019t keep it running, populate the teams or create a community out of it?</p> <p><strong>PK</strong>: No, I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s fair to say that queer players were over represented in the playing group.</p> <p><strong>ER</strong>: Julia, it took you a while to get to the Falcons nest but when you did, you were addicted. Why?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/30/darebin-falcons-dodge-bullet-to-continue-feeding-the-aflw\">Darebin Falcons dodge bullet to continue feeding the AFLW | Alana Schetzer</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Julia Chiera</strong>: I grew up as one of five sisters in a Catholic girls\u2019 school where women talked to each other in certain ways. The catalyst for that tone and those conversations was often to get the attention of men. I came to this place and all these women were connected through footy, a game that I loved. I was blown away.</p> <p><strong>ER</strong>: What are the benefits of a women-only football club?</p> <p><strong>JC</strong>: When you don\u2019t care about external opinions or fitting a stereotype it is powerful. When you do it en masse, it creates a culture.</p> <p><strong>ER</strong>: Seven years after you started playing football, we would see a lockout at Princes Park as the AFLW launched. How much do you credit the work of queer women to get female footy to that moment?</p> <p><strong>JC</strong>: It wouldn\u2019t have ever happened without the queer women in football keeping the game alive for female players. The women who played and administered female football from 1980 to the early 2010s created the connection and the community. We may not have been visible to the mainstream footy world, but we were visible to one another. We talk about \u201cif you can\u2019t see it you can\u2019t be it\u201d; that doesn\u2019t need to be on television, it can just be across the room, or across the field.</p> <p>From 2010 or so when women\u2019s sport was gaining momentum across codes, this group of women had kept women\u2019s football going. There was a big cohort of players that were ready to go. I just don\u2019t think it could have happened without them. This was highlighted in the first AFLW draft when 10 players from the Darebin Falcons were selected, including the No 1 draft pick Daisy Pearce.</p> <p><strong>ER</strong>: How did that first AFLW game make you feel?</p> <p><strong>JC</strong>: I thought about it a lot that first season. I grew up always wanting to see myself reflected and I never did. Suddenly there were all these queer players out on the field and in the paper and I thought this is so powerful. My 14-year-old self got some healing through that season.</p> <p><strong>ER</strong>: In Samantha Lane\u2019s book, Roar, female footy pioneer and Bulldogs general manager of women\u2019s football, Debbie Lee, talks about hiding her sexuality because she felt it would create another hurdle to get people on board with women\u2019s footy. You have worked inside an AFLW club. Does it remain a hurdle?</p> <p><strong>JC</strong>: Every player approaches it differently, and they may be more or less open depending on the environment and the immediate audience.

      "bodyText": "When the Swans host the Saints on Saturday afternoon the rainbow flag will fly at the SCG to mark the AFL\u2019s fourth Pride game. This celebration \u2013 one of a number of themed games in the AFL fixture that champions messages of inclusion and diversity \u2013 specifically provides an opportunity to acknowledge the impact Pride has on the football community. In the decades before the AFLW launched, the torch of women\u2019s football was kept alight by dedicated and passionate football-loving women. The women\u2019s game was largely invisible to the larger football community, but the clubs they created were inclusive and safe spaces for many queer identifying women. One such club is the Darebin Falcons Women\u2019s Sports Club. The Falcons are considered a powerhouse in the history of the women\u2019s game. Three former Falcons players came together at a recent event called Pride: Our Untold Stories of Women\u2019s Football to discuss the legacy of queer women on football and the role they played in creating a unique football culture which would lay the foundations for the AFLW competition. Patty Kinnersly is the CEO of Our Watch, a Carlton Football Club board member and was named in the Darebin Falcons silver jubilee team. Julia Chiera is currently an assistant coach in the VFLW and during the AFLW season the welfare manager for the Carlton AFLW team. Carlton player Darcy Vescio is one of the faces of the AFLW competition. Emma Race, who moderated the discussion, is an Our Watch Fellowship recipient and a member of the Outer Sanctum podcast team. ER: Patty, in the late 1990s your Ballarat footy team disbanded and you joined the Darebin Falcons. What impressed you about the club? PK: I saw it as a club with an inclusive and respectful culture. The Falcons were one of the first demonstrations of feminist leadership and governance I saw as a young person and it sparked something in me. We were women excited to play footy. ER: Why were queer women able to lead a space like this? PK: I suspect this had to do with growing up and not being as impacted by the gender stereotype of being feminine or feeling pressure to behave in a certain way to seek approval from men. Also, knowing you are different, you grow up with a heightened sense of compassion and understanding of people who are seen as different. You grow up understanding what discrimination is and how important it is to create the space for other people \u201cjust to be\u201d. ER: The Falcons were a powerful club in culture and professionalism. What contributed to that power? PK: They were a group who didn\u2019t worry about how people looked, where they came from, how many tattoos they had or how bad their mullet was. None of that mattered. It was all about what you brought, how you behaved and treating each other with respect. As a women\u2019s only club there was no scrutiny or worrying what the men thought. This was always a club where you were just free to be. It was compelling. ER: Would women\u2019s football have survived from the 1980s onwards if queer women didn\u2019t keep it running, populate the teams or create a community out of it? PK: No, I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s fair to say that queer players were over represented in the playing group. ER: Julia, it took you a while to get to the Falcons nest but when you did, you were addicted. Why? Julia Chiera: I grew up as one of five sisters in a Catholic girls\u2019 school where women talked to each other in certain ways. The catalyst for that tone and those conversations was often to get the attention of men. I came to this place and all these women were connected through footy, a game that I loved. I was blown away. ER: What are the benefits of a women-only football club? JC: When you don\u2019t care about external opinions or fitting a stereotype it is powerful. When you do it en masse, it creates a culture. ER: Seven years after you started playing football, we would see a lockout at Princes Park as the AFLW launched. How much do you credit the work of queer women to get female footy to that moment? JC: It wouldn\u2019t have ever happened without the queer women in football keeping the game alive for female players. The women who played and administered female football from 1980 to the early 2010s created the connection and the community. We may not have been visible to the mainstream footy world, but we were visible to one another. We talk about \u201cif you can\u2019t see it you can\u2019t be it\u201d; that doesn\u2019t need to be on television, it can just be across the room, or across the field. From 2010 or so when women\u2019s sport was gaining momentum across codes, this group of women had kept women\u2019s football going. There was a big cohort of players that were ready to go. I just don\u2019t think it could have happened without them. This was highlighted in the first AFLW draft when 10 players from the Darebin Falcons were selected, including the No 1 draft pick Daisy Pearce. ER: How did that first AFLW game make you feel? JC: I thought about it a lot that first season. I grew up always wanting to see myself reflected and I never did. Suddenly there were all these queer players out on the field and in the paper and I thought this is so powerful. My 14-year-old self got some healing through that season. ER: In Samantha Lane\u2019s book, Roar, female footy pioneer and Bulldogs general manager of women\u2019s football, Debbie Lee, talks about hiding her sexuality because she felt it would create another hurdle to get people on board with women\u2019s footy. You have worked inside an AFLW club. Does it remain a hurdle? JC: Every player approaches it differently, and they may be more or less open depending on the environment and the immediate audience. Some are open about their sexuality on social media without doing a press release. So, if you are looking for it you will see it, but if you\u2019re not, you won\u2019t. Players don\u2019t know if they will risk sponsorship, opportunity or safety if they are overt about it. Where Patty\u2019s generation was invisible, my generation was out but homogenous. I see Darcy\u2019s generation as more open, fluid and beyond labels. ER: Darcy, you came to women\u2019s football after playing in boys\u2019 teams in Wangaratta. What were your early impressions? DV: It was like walking onto another planet. I had been the only woman in Wangaratta who could look comfortable with a football. This was a whole space I didn\u2019t know existed.

It was not the role of those judges \u2013 chief justice Anne Ferguson, court of appeal president justice Chris Maxwell and justice Mark Weinberg \u2013 to decide Pell\u2019s guilt. Rather, the question they needed to consider was whether the 12 jurors who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/cardinal-george-pell-vatican-treasurer-found-guilty-of-child-sexual-assault\">found Pell guilty in December</a> must have held a reasonable doubt as to his guilt based on the evidence before them; not that they could have, or should have.

Pell supporters have focused on Weinberg\u2019s disagreement with Maxwell\u2019s and Ferguson\u2019s findings on the unreasonable ground of appeal. Much of this commentary has ignored the fact that in a criminal trial, it is entirely up to jurors to decide the facts of the case, and that it is not uncommon for appellant judges to disagree on appeal.</p> \n<p>Jurors are entrusted with reaching a verdict based not on gut instinct or emotion, but an analytical view of the evidence, combined with clear and strong directions from the judge and their own life experiences and reflections. It can be acceptable for jurors to believe the word of the complainant above all others, even in the absence of other witnesses. If this were not the case, rapists and abusers would never get convicted since these crimes rarely have an audience. On exceptional occasions jurors, like judges, get it wrong. But being wrong usually occurs in conjunction with misinterpretation and misapplication of the law, poor directions or a clumsily held trial.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"06c8b4af-0613-4370-a911-28195aef2ea9\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>What the public did not see during Pell\u2019s trial, which began in November and ran for five weeks, were the exhaustive arguments and discussions that occurred in the absence of the jurors between prosecutors, Pell\u2019s defence team and the chief judge, Peter Kidd. These discussions involved how evidence was to be presented to jurors and what jurors were not to be told. They laid the framework for cross-examination and re-examination. Importantly, there were robust but amicable discussions about the directions and warnings the jurors were to be given by Kidd.</p> \n<p>One decision was that jurors would not be told that Pell\u2019s second victim died from an accidental drug overdose. Jurors might have read too much into the cause of death, deciding he was not to be trusted due to his drug use, or that he turned to drug use because of the abuse. What is not told to jurors can be as vital to a fair trial as what is.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96eff66fdb7d20acb9fffd582e91cf4ce9cf1bf1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96eff66fdb7d20acb9fffd582e91cf4ce9cf1bf1/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters hold placards outside the court building as Cardinal George Pell is escorted into the supreme court of Victoria in Melbourne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters hold placards outside the court building as Cardinal George Pell is escorted into the supreme court of Victoria in Melbourne.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The jurors listened to Kidd intently. He repeatedly directed them not to make Pell a scapegoat for the Catholic church. He told them it was not enough to simply believe the complainant. In order to convict, they had to believe the complainant beyond reasonable doubt. These comprehensive, clear and, at times, stern directions included warnings not to research Pell on the internet, warnings that Pell was at a significant forensic disadvantage given the passage of time since the offending, and reminders that it was up to the prosecution to prove the case, not Pell to prove his innocence.</p> \n<p>The jurors were diverse, and included a church pastor, a mathematician and a tram driver. Over four days of deliberating, they reached the same conclusion: that in 1996 Pell sexually assaulted two 13 year-old boys after Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in the priest\u2019s sacristy. Pell orally raped one of the boys during this incident and indecently assaulted both of them. Pell offended a second time against one of the boys a month later, when he grabbed the boy\u2019s genitals in a church corridor, once more after Sunday solemn mass. He was convicted on four counts of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 and one count of sexual penetration with a child under the age of 16.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/aug/22/how-george-pell-lost-his-appeal-and-what-happens-next-the-reckoning-podcast\">How George Pell lost his appeal and what happens next \u2013 The Reckoning podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Ferguson and Maxwell said in their written reasons for dismissing Pell\u2019s appeal that \u201cit can be said with confidence that no advance in technology can ever replicate the unique features of jury deliberation and decision-making\u201d.</p> \n<p>There has been debate since Pell was first charged about whether Victoria should introduce judge-only trials. The thinking in other jurisdictions is that a judge, with all their experience and training, is more capable of casting aside prejudices and making a fair decision.</p> \n<p>But there is also little empirical research to support this claim, even in complex, high-profile cases. A 2018 paper from the University of Sydney law school, led by Rebecca McEwen, found: \u201cThe danger is that the assumption that a trial by judge alone is an adequate response to the problem of prejudicial publicity may stymie efforts to evaluate the true impact of such publicity and the best ways to ensure a finder of fact (judicial or lay) is able to make an impartial decision. That, in turn, risks undermining the integrity of the criminal justice system.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80df38265dce5f98fb1b2da3d32774e907211aa5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80df38265dce5f98fb1b2da3d32774e907211aa5/0_26_4740_2846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Pell arrives at the supreme court\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Pell arrives at the supreme court.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The jury system is a fundamental pillar of Australia\u2019s legal system. To suggest there is something fallible about the jury system in Pell\u2019s case in the absence of any procedural unfairness is to suggest the entire criminal legal system is fundamentally flawed. It would be to suggest that every jury trial might have been better or differently decided by a judge alone.</p> \n<p>We can never know what discussions occurred between the jurors who heard Pell\u2019s case. But perhaps some of them knew that grooming is not always a hallmark of child sexual abuse. That children often don\u2019t tell anyone about being abused for years, or decades. Perhaps they knew, as the child sexual abuse royal commission revealed in its exhaustive five-year inquiry, that children were frequently abused by members of clergy, in churches, in sacristies, in private homes and public places, and this abuse sometimes occurred while offending priests were wearing their robes. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/23/pell-is-in-jail-where-he-belongs-and-culture-warriors-let-fly-their-rage-at-the-fall-of-their-creature\">Pell is in jail where he belongs, and culture warriors let fly their rage at the fall of their creature | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Much <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/vital-pell-evidence-may-never-be-public/news-story/7998884afbf20b05c3afe233f82e9725\">has been made of the fact that the full transcript of the complainant\u2019s evidence in the trial has not been made public</a>. Every day, rape and assault cases are written about in the media, with the victim\u2019s evidence occurring behind closed doors in front of the legal teams and jurors alone. No one demands the full transcript of the victim testimony in those cases. The way the complainant has been written about in Pell\u2019s trial would leave some thinking we know nothing about his evidence, when, in fact, we know comprehensive details of his testimony because it has been heavily quoted, both during the trial and the appeal.</p> \n<p>We know that he and the other choir boy were sobbing during their assault, in shock, and whimpering. During the offending, Pell told them to be quiet. We know the boys did not complain to anyone. The complainant said during the trial that he feared losing his prestigious scholarship to St Kevin\u2019s College in Toorak if he said anything, given singing in the choir was a condition of the scholarship.</p> \n<p>There can be no public service or interest in interrogating the complainant\u2019s evidence during trial without the context and benefit of the jury directions from Kidd, and the full addresses from the legal parties. In the words of Ferguson and Maxwell: \u201cThe purpose and the genius of the jury system is that it allows for the ordinary experiences of ordinary people to be brought to bear in the determination of factual matters.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is fundamental to that purpose that the jury be allowed to determine, by inference from its collective experience of ordinary affairs, whether and, in the case of conflict, what evidence is truthful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pell supporters will hope Weinberg\u2019s comprehensive dissenting judgment will see Pell through an appeal to the high court. Few defence barristers in Victoria will weigh-in publicly on the case or the prospects for high court success, so heated and divisive are opinions on the trial. The founder of O\u2019Brien Solicitors and criminal defence lawyer Peter O\u2019Brien, who practises in NSW, says those relying on Weinberg\u2019s dissent for the case to be heard in the high court may be disappointed.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe high court is not generally interested in questions of fact but matters of law,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cThey are also interested in issues of high public interest. The fact Cardinal Pell is a very public figure who has been convicted doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a matter of public interest, it has to be a matter of public interest so far as law is concerned.</p> \n<p>\u201cVery rarely will the high court descend into matters associated with facts of a case. If I had a client in this situation, I would be advising them that their chances of high court success are very slim.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cardinal George Pell\u2019s formidable defence team presented Victoria\u2019s county court and the court of appeal with what they described as \u201c13 solid obstacles in the path of a conviction\u201d, which they said proved the abuse of two choirboys by Pell in 1996 could not have happened. This week, two out of three appellant judges decided that those 13 reasons fell \u201cwell short\u201d of such a conclusion. It was not the role of those judges \u2013 chief justice Anne Ferguson, court of appeal president justice Chris Maxwell and justice Mark Weinberg \u2013 to decide Pell\u2019s guilt. Rather, the question they needed to consider was whether the 12 jurors who found Pell guilty in December must have held a reasonable doubt as to his guilt based on the evidence before them; not that they could have, or should have. This was vital to Pell\u2019s appeal on the key ground that the jury made an unreasonable decision. Ferguson and Maxwell found the complainant\u2019s evidence against Pell was \u201crightly characterised\u201d by prosecutors \u201cas compelling, both because of the clarity and cogency of what [he] said and because of the complete absence of any indication of contrivance in the emotion which [he] conveyed when giving his answers\u201d. Their finding has not satisfied some public figures insisting on Pell\u2019s innocence, certain that jurors got it wrong. Pell supporters have focused on Weinberg\u2019s disagreement with Maxwell\u2019s and Ferguson\u2019s findings on the unreasonable ground of appeal. Much of this commentary has ignored the fact that in a criminal trial, it is entirely up to jurors to decide the facts of the case, and that it is not uncommon for appellant judges to disagree on appeal. Jurors are entrusted with reaching a verdict based not on gut instinct or emotion, but an analytical view of the evidence, combined with clear and strong directions from the judge and their own life experiences and reflections. It can be acceptable for jurors to believe the word of the complainant above all others, even in the absence of other witnesses. If this were not the case, rapists and abusers would never get convicted since these crimes rarely have an audience. On exceptional occasions jurors, like judges, get it wrong. But being wrong usually occurs in conjunction with misinterpretation and misapplication of the law, poor directions or a clumsily held trial. What the public did not see during Pell\u2019s trial, which began in November and ran for five weeks, were the exhaustive arguments and discussions that occurred in the absence of the jurors between prosecutors, Pell\u2019s defence team and the chief judge, Peter Kidd. These discussions involved how evidence was to be presented to jurors and what jurors were not to be told. They laid the framework for cross-examination and re-examination. Importantly, there were robust but amicable discussions about the directions and warnings the jurors were to be given by Kidd. One decision was that jurors would not be told that Pell\u2019s second victim died from an accidental drug overdose. Jurors might have read too much into the cause of death, deciding he was not to be trusted due to his drug use, or that he turned to drug use because of the abuse. What is not told to jurors can be as vital to a fair trial as what is. The jurors listened to Kidd intently. He repeatedly directed them not to make Pell a scapegoat for the Catholic church. He told them it was not enough to simply believe the complainant. In order to convict, they had to believe the complainant beyond reasonable doubt. These comprehensive, clear and, at times, stern directions included warnings not to research Pell on the internet, warnings that Pell was at a significant forensic disadvantage given the passage of time since the offending, and reminders that it was up to the prosecution to prove the case, not Pell to prove his innocence. The jurors were diverse, and included a church pastor, a mathematician and a tram driver. Over four days of deliberating, they reached the same conclusion: that in 1996 Pell sexually assaulted two 13 year-old boys after Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in the priest\u2019s sacristy. Pell orally raped one of the boys during this incident and indecently assaulted both of them. Pell offended a second time against one of the boys a month later, when he grabbed the boy\u2019s genitals in a church corridor, once more after Sunday solemn mass. He was convicted on four counts of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 and one count of sexual penetration with a child under the age of 16. Ferguson and Maxwell said in their written reasons for dismissing Pell\u2019s appeal that \u201cit can be said with confidence that no advance in technology can ever replicate the unique features of jury deliberation and decision-making\u201d. There has been debate since Pell was first charged about whether Victoria should introduce judge-only trials. The thinking in other jurisdictions is that a judge, with all their experience and training, is more capable of casting aside prejudices and making a fair decision. But there is also little empirical research to support this claim, even in complex, high-profile cases. A 2018 paper from the University of Sydney law school, led by Rebecca McEwen, found: \u201cThe danger is that the assumption that a trial by judge alone is an adequate response to the problem of prejudicial publicity may stymie efforts to evaluate the true impact of such publicity and the best ways to ensure a finder of fact (judicial or lay) is able to make an impartial decision. That, in turn, risks undermining the integrity of the criminal justice system.\u201d The jury system is a fundamental pillar of Australia\u2019s legal system. To suggest there is something fallible about the jury system in Pell\u2019s case in the absence of any procedural unfairness is to suggest the entire criminal legal system is fundamentally flawed. It would be to suggest that every jury trial might have been better or differently decided by a judge alone. We can never know what discussions occurred between the jurors who heard Pell\u2019s case. But perhaps some of them knew that grooming is not always a hallmark of child sexual abuse. That children often don\u2019t tell anyone about being abused for years, or decades. Perhaps they knew, as the child sexual abuse royal commission revealed in its exhaustive five-year inquiry, that children were frequently abused by members of clergy, in churches, in sacristies, in private homes and public places, and this abuse sometimes occurred while offending priests were wearing their robes. Much has been made of the fact that the full transcript of the complainant\u2019s evidence in the trial has not been made public. Every day, rape and assault cases are written about in the media, with the victim\u2019s evidence occurring behind closed doors in front of the legal teams and jurors alone. No one demands the full transcript of the victim testimony in those cases. The way the complainant has been written about in Pell\u2019s trial would leave some thinking we know nothing about his evidence, when, in fact, we know comprehensive details of his testimony because it has been heavily quoted, both during the trial and the appeal. We know that he and the other choir boy were sobbing during their assault, in shock, and whimpering. During the offending, Pell told them to be quiet. We know the boys did not complain to anyone. The complainant said during the trial that he feared losing his prestigious scholarship to St Kevin\u2019s College in Toorak if he said anything, given singing in the choir was a condition of the scholarship. There can be no public service or interest in interrogating the complainant\u2019s evidence during trial without the context and benefit of the jury directions from Kidd, and the full addresses from the legal parties. In the words of Ferguson and Maxwell: \u201cThe purpose and the genius of the jury system is that it allows for the ordinary experiences of ordinary people to be brought to bear in the determination of factual matters. \u201cIt is fundamental to that purpose that the jury be allowed to determine, by inference from its collective experience of ordinary affairs, whether and, in the case of conflict, what evidence is truthful.\u201d Pell supporters will hope Weinberg\u2019s comprehensive dissenting judgment will see Pell through an appeal to the high court. Few defence barristers in Victoria will weigh-in publicly on the case or the prospects for high court success, so heated and divisive are opinions on the trial. The founder of O\u2019Brien Solicitors and criminal defence lawyer Peter O\u2019Brien, who practises in NSW, says those relying on Weinberg\u2019s dissent for the case to be heard in the high court may be disappointed. \u201cThe high court is not generally interested in questions of fact but matters of law,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cThey are also interested in issues of high public interest. The fact Cardinal Pell is a very public figure who has been convicted doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a matter of public interest, it has to be a matter of public interest so far as law is concerned. \u201cVery rarely will the high court descend into matters associated with facts of a case. If I had a client in this situation, I would be advising them that their chances of high court success are very slim.\u201d",

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThe campaign began with a single post we published last week on what Jones said, and now the other admins and I feel we\u2019re just surfing the waves of fury,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThere are other activists involved, for sure, but the biggest effort is clearly coming from our 56,000 followers or witches. I know this because with every sponsor withdrawal the page gets hundreds (sometimes thousands) of messages advising us of it within minutes, which proves the huge, angry numbers of people putting enormous effort into expressing what they feel to the companies involved.\u201d The Tate statement was such a slap in the face for the veteran shock jock, some speculated he may not even turn up to work on Monday. \u201cNotwithstanding his apologies, I have today discussed the matter with Alan and advised him that any recurrence of commentary of this nature will result in the termination of his contract,\u201d Tate said in the media statement issued on Saturday night. He did turn up but not before telling Tate that he made 2GB and how dare they threaten him so publicly. It was less a mea culpa and more of a woe is me. The message was that he worked really hard while others \u201cwaltzed the corridors being unproductive\u201d, a 2GB source said. It may have been worse for Jones if Tate had known Jones said Ardern should be \u201cbackhanded\u201d. But he didn\u2019t know until the audio was played on ABC TV\u2019s Media Watch on Monday night. On Tuesday Jones was still defiant, telling Nine News that he was the victim because of the \u201cvile\u201d attacks on him on social media. He also claimed advertisers who chose to abandon his program, and there were at least 20 by then, would simply be replaced by others. \u201cI\u2019ve got no comment about the advertisers, they can make their own judgment if they go,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be others that take their place.\u201d The backlash from advertisers, although significant, was not the only trigger for Tate to threaten to tear up Jones\u2019s contract. The king of talkback radio has been on shaky ground with management since losing a major defamation case brought by the Toowoomba-based Wagner family last year. Justice Peter Flanagan found Jones was repeatedly \u201cwilfully blind to the truth\u201d when he made \u201cvicious and spiteful\u201d comments about the family and ordered Jones, 2GB and 4BC to pay $3.4m in damages for defaming John, Denis, Neill and Joe Wagner, plus interest estimated to be about $300,000. Behind the scenes Jones\u2019s on-air tirades have brought legal action which is never made public, but quietly settled by Macquarie lawyers. He is almost uninsurable now. There was a long delay in signing Jones to his current two-year contract, which runs until July 2021, largely because of the huge cost of defending him from defamation claims, not to mention the litany of apologies he\u2019s had to make to everyone from Ardern to Malcolm Turnbull for calling him a traitor and the chief executive of the Sydney Opera House, Louise Herron, for berating her on air. After months of tense negotiations during which the Macquarie chief executive, Adam Lang, tried to get tough new conditions into Jones\u2019s contract to prevent a recurrence of all the problems, Macquarie agreed to sign Jones again in May largely on the insistence of the Nine chairman, Peter Costello. But not three months into the new deal the 78 year old has brought disrepute on the station again. The companies which have protested include RSL Art Unions, Bing Lee, Snooze, Bunnings, Volkswagen, Koala Mattresses, Anytime Fitness, Total Tools, AVEO, Lowes, Chemist Warehouse, Red Cross, OMG Mattresses, Hyundai, Sleeping Duck and Scali. A spokeswoman for Big W said the company was withdrawing its ads from Jones and 2GB permanently \u201cdue to recent comments made on 2GB\u201d. Similarly, Mercedes-Benz Australia and ME Bank won\u2019t be returning. \u201cME is a values-led organisation with a long history and culture of fairness and respect,\u201d the bank said. \u201cOur employees, customers and wider community have a reasonable expectation we\u2019ll continue to maintain and defend those principles. \u201cAlan Jones\u2019 comments last week about Jacinda Ardern were not in keeping, and we acted in accordance with our corporate conscience. \u201cWe won\u2019t be advertising on the Alan Jones show ever again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Australian multinational at the centre of an Iran sanctions scandal has offloaded a $15m shipment of Iranian cargo it says it was duped into taking, and is reviewing its operations to avoid a repeat. A subsidiary of ASX-listed company Incitec Pivot took hold of a cargo shipment of fertiliser from Iran late last month, potentially risking a contravention of strict United States sanctions. The company, Quantum Fertiliser, said it was deceived by its supplier about the origin of the product, and quickly moved to offload it. Shipping logs, internal documents and leaked video show how the cargo originated in Iran aboard a vessel known as the CS Future, before being transported to China and reloaded on to a second ship, the Bulk Aquila, which was being used by the Australian-owned company. The cargo was supposed to be sold to customers in India. Guardian Australia first revealed the existence of the shipment a week ago. The company said it had already detected that the shipment had suspect origins while it was loading the fertiliser at a port in Lianyungang, China. A Quantum spokesman said its supplier had offloaded the cargo at a port in Yantai, in China\u2019s Shandong province. The company said it had not identified any other shipments from Iran that it had taken hold of. \u201cWe are conducting a review to ensure that we can remove the risk of a repeat occurrence,\u201d the spokesman said. Australian and US authorities have remained tight-lipped about the issue. The US state department has not responded to queries, and Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) issued a general statement, urging businesses to be careful of foreign sanctions. US sanctions apply extraterritorially, including to Australian businesses, and anyone found to be dealing with Iran faces being effectively frozen out of US business. \u201cAustralian businesses need to consider not only Australia\u2019s sanctions regimes, but also those of other jurisdictions which may affect their operations,\u201d a DFAT spokesman said. \u201cThe Australian government encourages Australian businesses to examine and take legal advice on implications of re-established domestic sanctions by the United States.\u201d The US sanctions were resumed after Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. The move has prompted fears over seemingly innocuous interactions with Iran. Brazil\u2019s state-owned oil company, Petrobras, refused to refuel two vessels carrying Iranian fertiliser last month, for fear of US retribution. The decision left the two ships stranded for a month, leading to a court battle and threats from Iran of retaliation. Quantum said it had no knowledge that the shipment was from Iran. It said it had a contract with its Chinese supplier to provide only Chinese products. \u201cQuantum was supplied with formal documentation which purported to verify the source of this product, but on checking this documentation Quantum was not satisfied as to the origin of this product,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cQuantum took immediate action to reject the product and require that it be offloaded, and replaced with Chinese product. Quantum was misled about the origin of the product.\u201d But internal documents suggest the company knew that the cargo being loaded on to its ship had just been offloaded from the CS Future. Separate records obtained by the Guardian show the CS Future had arrived from Iran\u2019s Bandar Abbas port on 1 July.",

      "bodyText": "In 2010, with the Liberal party in New South Wales within striking distance of forming government for the first time in 16 years, the then opposition leader, Barry O\u2019Farrell, helped broker a peace deal between the party\u2019s warring factions. The handshake deal between the moderate powerbroker Michael Photios and rightwing standard-bearer David Clarke settled the party\u2019s preselections going into the 2011 election, and allowed the Liberals to sit back and watch as Labor imploded. Part of that \u201cpeace in our time\u201d deal, a senior Liberal party source told Guardian Australia this week, was a moratorium on any change to abortion law in the state. \u201cThe agreement was that after 2011 the moderates would not move on it, and nor would David [Clarke] and the guys on the right who wanted to crack down further,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe\u2019d just stick with the 1971 [common law] decision and in effect freeze the issue.\u201d The handshake deal remained mostly in place through the government\u2019s first two terms. It\u2019s part of the reason why when Greens upper house MP Mehreen Faruqi moved a bill in the upper house to remove abortion from the Crimes Act in 2017, even government MPs in favour of reform helped to vote it down. But nine years later the peace deal has been dramatically thrown out, and the Coalition government is tearing itself apart over a bill to finally decriminalise abortion in the state. Ministers are in open revolt, MPs are threatening to quit and, five months after she led the Coalition to an unlikely third term in majority government, the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, is being described in newspaper columns as \u201cembattled\u201d. Based on legislation passed in Queensland last year and co-sponsored by 15 MPs from across the political divide, the Reproductive Healthcare Reform bill removes abortion from the state\u2019s 119-year-old Crimes Act and creates a standalone healthcare act to regulate the procedure. It allows for terminations up to 22 weeks and, after that, with the approval of two doctors. Berejiklian, the health minister, Brad Hazzard, and the local government minister, Shelley Hancock, are among its supporters in the ministry. But after easily passing the lower house 59 votes to 31 two weeks ago, Berejiklian this week caved to pressure from opponents of abortion reform and delayed a final vote on the bill in the upper house by three weeks. It came after a concerted campaign by reform opponents to derail the bill. This week the anti-abortion former minister for women Tanya Davies said the bill had caused a \u201ccrisis of government\u201d. Davies and fellow reform opponent Kevin Conolly have refused to rule out moving to the crossbench over the issue. Anthony Roberts, the counter-terrorism minister, the police minister, David Elliott, the finance minister, Damien Tudehope, and the backbencher Matthew Mason-Cox have also criticised the premier\u2019s handling of the bill. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned \u2013 and I\u2019ve raised it with the premier directly \u2013 that we are undermining our ability as a government to prosecute our agenda with what we\u2019ve done with this bill,\u201d Mason-Cox said at a press conference this week. On the other side of the Coalition ledger, the bill has exposed divisions between the former federal Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce and his state counterparts. Joyce was criticised by the deputy premier, John Barilaro, after he sought to intervene in the debate by recording a series of robocalls claiming the bill would \u201clegalise abortion for any reason right up until the day of birth\u201d and addressing an anti-abortion protest outside of the state parliament. The Nationals MP Trevor Khan is one of the bill\u2019s architects, and the party\u2019s support will be key to it passing next month. Sources within the party told Guardian Australia this week that Joyce\u2019s vocal opposition to the bill has only hardened their resolve to support it. They even discussed his expulsion from the party at a meeting this week. Amid all the noise, that the bill easily passed its second reading in the upper house 26 votes to 15 this week hardly seems to matter. The bill\u2019s lead sponsor, the independent Sydney MP Alex Greenwich, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the delay but the bill\u2019s supporters remain confident it will pass. \u201cBut the upper house has their processes and they have now provided a pathway and time for a final vote,\u201d Greenwich said. \u201cThis will allow time for some of the concerning amendments to be further scrutinised.\u201d But what is the right actually hoping for? How much of it is about a bill to remove abortion from the state\u2019s criminal code, and how much of it is about something else? Opponents of reform such as Davies and Connolly are true believers. Davies, in particular, has been pushing for amendments to bill including provisions to ban so-called gender or sex selection. During the lower-house debate she unsuccessfully sought to include an amendment stating that terminations not \u201cbe used for gender selection\u201d. Davies relied on a 2018 study from La Trobe University that found that while the ratio of boys and girls born in Victoria was close to natural rates of 105 boys to every 100 girls, there were higher rates of boys born to mothers who had migrated from China and India. But during a review of the legislation last week, a number of expert medical, legal and women\u2019s groups said there was no evidence the practice was an issue in NSW and this week one of the report\u2019s co-authors told the New Daily the study\u2019s findings had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d. For others on the right, though, the fight is about something else: Berejiklian. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about this bill, this bill is just a symptom of a bigger problem,\u201d one figure from the party\u2019s right told Guardian Australia this week. \u201cRight now the tensions are really being caused by her leadership style. She\u2019s pedantic and controlling, the whole government is centralised out of her office and everyone hates her staff. And she\u2019s terrible at communicating big strategies to cabinet so most of them have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d While the premier isn\u2019t in danger of a challenge, there is a sense that the groundwork is being laid. If that seems unlikely \u2013 or even ludicrous \u2013 given it\u2019s been just five months since Berejiklian returned the government for a third term against expectations, consider this. \u201cSome people might say that,\u201d the right-faction source said. \u201cOthers would say it\u2019s the perfect time to be thinking about it. If you do it now, you\u2019ve got three years of clear air.\u201d",

The prevalence of suicide among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is around twice that of non-Indigenous Australians.</p> <p>The prime minister noted that around 80% of people who die by suicide have a mental health issue, but there are a range of factors and circumstances which may contribute to suicide. Morgan says we have to be careful not to consider suicide as indistinguishable from mental health, because many people who end their own lives have had no contact with that system at all.</p> <p>In order to think through steps that can be taken to lower the risks of a person reaching the critical point of despair, there is a need to consider the social determinants. \u201cTo do that, we need to look at unemployment and what that might mean for somebody, you need to look at housing security \u2026 and believe it or not, food security,\u201d she says.

People who are unwell worry about the consequences of disclosing their illnesses \u2013 how it might impact their job prospects, or the capacity to get life insurance. Women in custody battles can also find their medical history used against them.</p> <p>Morgan says while Australians are much more aware of mental health than they used to be, \u201cwe use two words, mental health, to describe a broad range of what it is to be mentally unhealthy, unwell, having psychotic incidents \u2013 and I fear we still have a long way to go to properly unpack that whole concept of mental health, and fully attribute different concepts of unwellness\u201d.</p>",

The prime minister noted that around 80% of people who die by suicide have a mental health issue, but there are a range of factors and circumstances which may contribute to suicide. Morgan says we have to be careful not to consider suicide as indistinguishable from mental health, because many people who end their own lives have had no contact with that system at all. In order to think through steps that can be taken to lower the risks of a person reaching the critical point of despair, there is a need to consider the social determinants. \u201cTo do that, we need to look at unemployment and what that might mean for somebody, you need to look at housing security \u2026 and believe it or not, food security,\u201d she says. Morgan says the justice system is another factor, as is trauma, which she says is \u201ca clear area of risk\u201d. We talk on the podcast about one cohort known to have elevated risks \u2013 trans young people. The ABC\u2019s Media Watch program this week criticised the Australian for renewing its focus on transgender issues, including the creation of a \u201cgender\u201d page on its website, containing almost completely negative coverage of trans issues. Morgan says she is concerned about the trend, and she\u2019s also concerned about the impact of social media discussion on people who are either battling illness, or at risk of becoming unwell. She says there is no prospect of turning the tap off, so intervention is needed to help kids at risk to be resilient in the face of insensitive public debate. She says media companies need to mind \u201cthe manner\u201d in which material is communicated. \u201cIt\u2019s about respectful dialogue,\u201d Morgan says. More broadly, she says also that the stigma associated with mental illness remains a significant problem in Australia. People who are unwell worry about the consequences of disclosing their illnesses \u2013 how it might impact their job prospects, or the capacity to get life insurance. Women in custody battles can also find their medical history used against them. Morgan says while Australians are much more aware of mental health than they used to be, \u201cwe use two words, mental health, to describe a broad range of what it is to be mentally unhealthy, unwell, having psychotic incidents \u2013 and I fear we still have a long way to go to properly unpack that whole concept of mental health, and fully attribute different concepts of unwellness\u201d.",

The existence of the internal discussion was first reported by the Guardian in March 2019. That report marked Facebook\u2019s first acknowledgement that some of its employees were aware of concerns about improper data practices by Cambridge Analytica four months before the Guardian\u2019s 11 December 2015 article exposed them. Facebook\u2019s lack of candor about this earlier knowledge to both investors and the press was one of the subjects of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint that Facebook settled by paying a $100m fine in July. Facebook did not admit or deny the SEC\u2019s allegations as part of its settlement. But the correspondence \u2013 which the Washington DC attorney general\u2019s office fought for months to unseal as part of its lawsuit \u2013 provides new insight into how Facebook staff reacted, or did not react, to concerns about the use of user data by political campaign consultants. A request to clarify Facebook\u2019s policies for how political campaigns could legitimately use Facebook data appears to have languished with little attention or \u201cresources\u201d, until after the Guardian reported in 2015 on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s use of Facebook data to create \u201cpsychographic profiles\u201d of voters for Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign. At that point, the topic was flagged as \u201chi pri\u201d [high priority]. The Observer\u2019s March 2018 report on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s continued use of the data and links to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign erupted into an international scandal, inspiring global outrage over the company\u2019s failure to protect users\u2019 personal data and wiping $134bn off Facebook\u2019s market value as its stock price plunged. The correspondence was initiated on 22 September 2015, when a Facebook staff member requested clarification on Facebook\u2019s policies for political consultancies that were scraping data to match Facebook profiles to the lists of voters that campaigns use, known as voter files. (The names of Facebook employees are redacted.) \u201cWe suspect many of these companies are doing similar types of scraping, the largest and most aggressive on the conservative side being Cambridge Analytica \u2026 a sketchy (to say the least) data modeling company that has penetrated our market deeply.\u201d The employee requested clarity on Facebook\u2019s policies and an investigation into \u201cwhat Cambridge specifically is actually doing\u201d, as well as further information about the activities of another political consultancy, NationBuilder. No one appears to have responded for a week, and on 29 September another message was sent reiterating that political clients were submitting \u201cpointed questions \u2026 around what is in bounds versus what is out of bounds\u201d. \u201cMany companies seem to be in on the edge \u2013 possibly over,\u201d the staffer wrote. This second message prompted a handful of responses with differing opinions on the legitimacy of the data practices.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka is a player of immense potential, a full international in waiting, and is missed at Crystal Palace. Manchester United, who will field the right-back against his former club on Saturday, have prised away a gem from south London.</p> <p>All the staggering statistics that marked out the best tackling defender in the top flight while Wan-Bissaka was at Palace have been maintained through his early days at Old Trafford. No one summoned more than his 15 tackles from the opening two games, and, in a team who will enjoy more possession, there have been hints that his attacking game is developing at pace. What had first marked out the defender when he was summoned across Copers Cope Road from the academy to make up the numbers had been an ability to choke Wilfried Zaha in one-on-one duels. The revisiting of that training t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate will provide an intriguing subplot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/23/racist-abuse-manchester-united-paul-pogba-will-make-him-stronger-solskjaer\">'We need to protect individuals': Solskj\u00e6r on racist abuse of Pogba</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Zaha, who had been just as eager to depart Selhurst Park over the summer, was once on<strong> </strong>United\u2019s books himself and waved his friend away with advice to \u201cplay without fear, just like last season\u201d. That had been Wan\u2011Bissaka\u2019s first full senior campaign. \u201cWe thought we were talking about a potential England international right-back,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cGareth Southgate has got a lot of competition in that place, but that\u2019s how I see Aaron developing. The way he\u2019s settled in [at United] has been very nice to see. It doesn\u2019t surprise me because I know how well he can do, but it\u2019s still not an easy task that he\u2019s accomplished.</p> <p>\u201cWe just wish him well.

      "bodyText": "Roy Hodgson digressed at one point, turning to opera to conjure an analogy that referenced the celebrated tenors Jussi Bj\u00f6rling and Enrico Caruso, but the tone of his message remained clear. Aaron Wan-Bissaka is a player of immense potential, a full international in waiting, and is missed at Crystal Palace. Manchester United, who will field the right-back against his former club on Saturday, have prised away a gem from south London. All the staggering statistics that marked out the best tackling defender in the top flight while Wan-Bissaka was at Palace have been maintained through his early days at Old Trafford. No one summoned more than his 15 tackles from the opening two games, and, in a team who will enjoy more possession, there have been hints that his attacking game is developing at pace. What had first marked out the defender when he was summoned across Copers Cope Road from the academy to make up the numbers had been an ability to choke Wilfried Zaha in one-on-one duels. The revisiting of that training t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate will provide an intriguing subplot. Zaha, who had been just as eager to depart Selhurst Park over the summer, was once on United\u2019s books himself and waved his friend away with advice to \u201cplay without fear, just like last season\u201d. That had been Wan\u2011Bissaka\u2019s first full senior campaign. \u201cWe thought we were talking about a potential England international right-back,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cGareth Southgate has got a lot of competition in that place, but that\u2019s how I see Aaron developing. The way he\u2019s settled in [at United] has been very nice to see. It doesn\u2019t surprise me because I know how well he can do, but it\u2019s still not an easy task that he\u2019s accomplished. \u201cWe just wish him well. I had no fears about the club he was going to. I knew Michael Carrick well from my England days, and Ole Gunnar [Solskj\u00e6r] I know a lot about. Sir Alex [Ferguson] is still there, and that\u2019s important. I told him: \u2018You\u2019re going to a good club who will help you. All you\u2019ve got to do is keep doing what you\u2019ve done for us, working hard and being professional. Keep modest and humble with your feet on the ground, accepting there\u2019s always more to learn, and then your talent will see you through.\u2019\u201d Hodgson described the negotiations which sealed Wan-Bissaka\u2019s transfer as having achieved \u201cagreement reasonably quickly and certainly reasonably amicably\u201d. That is open to debate given United\u2019s initial proposals had been rather more creative in terms of the structure of the deal that Palace had been willing to accept. At one point, talks appeared to be breaking down, with the London club laughing off a proposal which would have guaranteed them \u00a335m, with a further \u00a315m dependent upon personal and collective honours, some of which \u2013 including winning the Champions League \u2013 they deemed to be rather unrealistic.

      "bodyText": "Britain will continue to be an \u201cenergetic partner\u201d to its international allies after Brexit, Boris Johnson has said, as he prepared to fly to Biarritz for the G7 summit \u2013 his first major appearance on the world stage as prime minister. Fresh from Brexit discussions in Berlin and Paris this week, Johnson will use a string of bilateral meetings with world leaders in the French resort to underline Britain\u2019s determination to remain internationalist. \u201cMy message to G7 leaders this week is this. The Britain I lead will be an international, outward-looking, self-confident nation,\u201d he said in remarks released by Downing Street in advance of the meeting. \u201cWe will be an energetic partner on the world stage. We will stand alongside our G7 allies to solve the most pressing international issues.\u201d Johnson\u2019s most closely watched encounter will be a Sunday breakfast with Donald Trump, at which the pair are expected to discuss issues including Iran, Hong Kong and the prospects for a bilateral trade deal after Brexit. Johnson will reiterate the UK\u2019s determination to protect the NHS against incursions from US companies. He will also underline his commitment to maintaining the UK\u2019s stringent animal welfare standards. The US president has repeatedly praised Johnson, calling him \u201cBritain Trump\u201d, and stressing their \u201cvery good relationship\u201d. Downing Street is keen to capitalise on the rapport between the pair, as the UK prepares to leave the vast trading bloc of the EU. Johnson is wary thoughof being seen as Trump\u2019s poodle, the derisive term often used to describe Tony Blair\u2019s relationship with George W Bush during the Iraq war. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused Johnson on Friday of pursuing a \u201cTrump first\u201d foreign policy. \u201cThe UK should use its position in the G7, on the UN security council and the international financial institutions to promote policies to tackle the climate emergency and that are proven to reduce inequality and improve lives around the world, including universal healthcare, education and social security,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cInstead, this weekend we\u2019ll see the ugly spectacle of our prime minister pursuing his Trump-first policy, putting us at the mercy of a US administration that threatens peace, prosperity and the future of our planet.\u201d Downing Street is not expecting a specific timetable for trade talks to emerge from the weekend\u2019s discussions. Both sides are conscious of the challenging questions involved, including on animal welfare standards and the NHS. A government spokesperson said: \u201cOf course we want to move quickly, but we want to get the right deal that works for both sides.\u201d Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, has suggested a series of \u201cfast track\u201d deals could be signed covering specific sectors \u2013 perhaps within months of Brexit day. London, however, intends to continue pursuing a broader agreement, which is likely to take longer to conclude. Cross-Whitehall analysis published last year suggested a new trade deal with the US would be likely to add just 0.2% to GDP in the long term. The thorniest issue under discussion is likely to be Iran. Johnson is not expected to signal any shift in position away from staunch support for the multilateral nuclear deal rejected by Trump. He hopes to stress the shared aims of both the US and Europe in restraining Tehran, despite bitter disagreement in recent months about how to approach the issue. Johnson also appeared to take aim at Trump\u2019s tit-for-tat economic battle with China in his pre-summit statement, pointing to the damage wrought by new barriers to trade. \u201cInternational tensions and new trade barriers are threatening global growth,\u201d he said, before listing a string of other issues on the agenda in France. \u201cViolence and conflict are trapping countries in poverty, depriving children, and particularly girls, of the universal right to education. Climate change is accelerating the devastating and unprecedented loss of habitats and species.\u201d France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, has scrapped the idea of an overarching G7 communique, hoping to skirt lengthy wrangles over issues such as the climate crisis, where the Trump White House stands apart. Aseries of separate agreements are expected to be published instead. As well as meeting Trump, and the Canadian, Japanese and Italian leaders, Johnson will also hold his first face-to-face discussions with the European council president, Donald Tusk, as the government races to meet what the prime minister has called the \u201cblistering\u201d timetable for reworking the Brexit deal. The lead on Brexit is taken not by the European council, but the European commission, whose president, Jean-Claude Juncker, will not be in Biarritz because he is recovering from an operation. With Labour threatening to table a vote of no confidence when parliament returns from its summer recess next month in an effort to avert a no-deal Brexit, Johnson is keen to demonstrate his determination to negotiate a deal. He has seized on the German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s mention of seeking a solution within 30 days, though both she and Macron both restated their determination that the Irish backstop must remain in place. Johnson will again reiterate his government\u2019s determination to leave the EU on 31 October, come what may.",

I remember when players used to get a season to adapt to the Premier League, not a fortnight! For a player who had previously played in Belgium and Slovakia, Wesley looked absolutely superb tonight. So any impatient types, let him be \u2013 he won\u2019t always be \u201con\u201d, I\u2019m sure, but he\u2019s clearly got it.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d6054d38f081cf11cf1c116\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-23T21:06:39.730Z\">10.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>McGinn speaks:</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a relief. When you spend as much as we\u2019ve spent it\u2019s a relief to get off the mark. We did have that belief we could do something this season. One win doesn\u2019t make a massive difference but it does lift morale and give everyone a good start.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mings on Wesley:</strong> \u201cIt was probably important for him [to score]. Obviously you want to get a goal as quickly as possible, as a striker, and I think it\u2019ll do him the world of good.

But from the opening goal onwards the hosts were very good, brimming with energy and intent all over the park. Wesley, in only his third Premier League game, was an absolute star leading the line. Mings and Engels did some proper, old-fashioned defending to keep them safe at the back. It was a real shift from everyone and they\u2019ll look to push on from here.</p> <p>For Everton, huge disappointment after starting the game \u2013 and indeed the season \u2013 pretty well. They were flat for too long after going behind. Kean and Iwobi did give them a different dimension though so I expect they\u2019ll be looking to integrate them as soon as possible into the starting lineup.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d6052938f084061ab38b9a1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-23T20:55:18.279Z\">9.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Aston Villa 2-0 Everton</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And it\u2019s the final action \u2013 a huge first win of the season for Villa, and a well deserved one!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d6052368f084061ab38b99e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-23T20:54:39.870Z\">9.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Goal!

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you now \u2013 but not before sharing tonight\u2019s match report from Villa Park, courtesy of Stuart James: Thanks for your company \u2013 and ice cream recommendations \u2013 as ever. See you again soon! Smith also speaks: \u201cI thought the atmosphere was tremendous under the lights. It was a hard-earned win, they started very brightly but we grew into the game and always looked a threat on the break. To get that goal at the end just capped it off.\u201d Incredible that Mings had to field a question about criticism of Wesley, whose first two games apparently brought some brickbats from fans. It was referred to constantly in the commentary too. I remember when players used to get a season to adapt to the Premier League, not a fortnight! For a player who had previously played in Belgium and Slovakia, Wesley looked absolutely superb tonight. So any impatient types, let him be \u2013 he won\u2019t always be \u201con\u201d, I\u2019m sure, but he\u2019s clearly got it. McGinn speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a relief. When you spend as much as we\u2019ve spent it\u2019s a relief to get off the mark. We did have that belief we could do something this season. One win doesn\u2019t make a massive difference but it does lift morale and give everyone a good start.\u201d Mings on Wesley: \u201cIt was probably important for him [to score]. Obviously you want to get a goal as quickly as possible, as a striker, and I think it\u2019ll do him the world of good. He does that to me in training all the time.\u201d Well played, Villa. Everton can point to those late chances for Iwobi and Walcott, and the latter should certainly have equalised. But from the opening goal onwards the hosts were very good, brimming with energy and intent all over the park. Wesley, in only his third Premier League game, was an absolute star leading the line. Mings and Engels did some proper, old-fashioned defending to keep them safe at the back. It was a real shift from everyone and they\u2019ll look to push on from here. For Everton, huge disappointment after starting the game \u2013 and indeed the season \u2013 pretty well. They were flat for too long after going behind. Kean and Iwobi did give them a different dimension though so I expect they\u2019ll be looking to integrate them as soon as possible into the starting lineup. And it\u2019s the final action \u2013 a huge first win of the season for Villa, and a well deserved one! That\u2019ll do it! It comes from more wonderful hold-up play from the outstanding Wesley, who chases a long pass and waits before finding \u2013 I think \u2013 McGinn, who passes the ball left. El Ghazi is running in, just ahead of his teammate Grealish, and he keeps his cool to slot in the goal that removes any doubt! 94 min: That\u2019s surely the last chance as Walcott, inside the area on the right, clips a good low cross in for Digne to spin onto. But it\u2019s on his weaker right foot and only a half-chance really. He slices well off target. 90+2 min: The noise levels have gone up again. Villa are very close now. Everton have had those two big chances with Iwobi and Walcott, and have certainly looked much livelier since the subs, but they just haven\u2019t done enough here overall. 90+1 min: We will have five added minutes. 89 min: What a miss from Walcott! Iwobi slides in Kean, who twists and then delivers towards the far post. It\u2019s a chipped ball that sits perfectly for Walcott to volley home ... but he skies it! That might be Everton\u2019s last big chance! La Martiniere in Saint-Martin, Ron. Do try it. There\u2019s one near the Phare des Baleines too. 86 min: Now we have handbags, Trezeguet rolling around on the floor after some sort of confrontation with Coleman, who wanted to take a quick set-piece. Both are booked. It was just silliness. \u201cHow clever of Theo Walcott to change his name to \u2018Alex Iwobi\u2019 and think we wouldn\u2019t notice,\u201d writes Joe Harvey. Now the fairly quiet \u2013 bar that bit of theatrics \u2013 Trezeguet is replaced by his more defensive compatriot, Elmohamady. 84 min: Yes, it\u2019s end to end now. El Ghazi advances and forces Pickford to beat away his 25-yard strike. 82 min: Iwobi hits the post! He\u2019s been a real danger since coming on and, my word, that\u2019s as close as Everton have come. He meets a Keane header sharply on the run, brings the ball down with a superb first touch and then thuds it low off the base of the upright from 15 yards. So unlucky! 81 min: Ohhh, Grealish weaves into a great position in the box but he just can\u2019t make a chance for Trezeguet. Good work from McGinn set all that up. Villa are starting to get a few glimpses again. 80 min: A booking for Gomes, who tries to get in the way of a quick Villa free-kick and ends up costing his own team time. 79 min: \u201cWhile brainstorming weird ice cream flavours (as you do), I once suggested Prawn &amp; Pecan,\u201d says Ed Russell. \u201cIt\u2019s catchy, but I\u2019ve never found it on sale anywhere, sadly.\u201d Ed, you disgust me. I have, in saying that, eaten oyster ice cream on Ile de Re before and it\u2019s actually lovely. 78 min: The excellent Jota is replaced by El Ghazi. And there\u2019s a third Everton change. Remember Theo Walcott? This might just be the promising young forward\u2019s breakthrough year, I reckon, and he\u2019s on for Richarlison. 77 min: I say that but then Mings miskicks after another sweet Digne delivery and Villa have to scramble the ball away for a corner. They are just starting to live a little dangerously, so it\u2019s a good job the corner is cleared out to the relatively harmless Schneiderlin, who curls well over. 75 min: Digne crosses deliciously after combining with Iwobi but Mings, clearly given wings by that Red Bull tonight as he\u2019s been very good, thuds a header clear ahead of two onrushing forwards. 74 min: That reminds me, actually, that Stuart James wrote an excellent primer on Wesley last month. 72 min: Villa aren\u2019t offering much going forward in this half, evidenced by a woeful cross out of play by Taylor there, but Wesley is continuing to hold the ball up very well. 71 min: A sight for Iwobi, now, as Digne pulls the ball back and he has a glimmer of space in the box. He sets himself and hits one, but it deflects up and Heaton is able to catch. 69 min: It just hasn\u2019t gone for Gomes today. He shifts into position a few yards outside the area but seems to lose confidence in the idea of shooting and instead lays the ball right, where Coleman ... isn\u2019t there. 68 min: \u201cStrange ice-cream flavours?\u201d asks Thomas Ireland-Delfs. Yes please, Thomas. \u201cHow about rhubarb with sea-buckthorn. Actually quite good here in Aarhus.\u201d 66 min: Kean now makes a rapid dart down the left before finding Iwobi. The move slows down but a corner eventually results from it and there are a few early signs of life from the subs. Mina gets up to meet the flag kick again, and this time his header is deflected not too far wide. From the other side, Digne\u2019s inswinger is headed away well by Mings. 64 min: Not yet, although Iwobi does get the ball in a nice area after a loose Mings pass but Kean can\u2019t read his attempt at a through ball. 62 min: Here\u2019s that double Everton change. Iwobi comes on for his debut in Sigurdsson\u2019s place; Kean enters the fray for Bernard. Will this perk them up? 59 min: Mings is unmarked as he hangs in the air to meet a Grealish free-kick, but his header across goal flicks off a defender \u2013 not an arm, despite the crowd\u2019s wails \u2013 and into Pickford\u2019s arms. I think we are about to see Kean and Iwobi, by the way. 58 min: Villa must fancy themselves on the break at this point but Jota, so dangerous when he darts inside, can\u2019t quite put Trezeguet through with pretty much the same pass that sliced Everton open for the goal. 57 min: Did you know Luis Boa Morte is now on Silva\u2019s coaching staff? I didn\u2019t, but the pair are having a long discussion on the bench \u2013 perhaps about imminent subs. 55 min: Better from Everton, Digne and Gomes combining to win a corner on the left. Digne flings it in, Mina attacks it well in characteristic fashion, but the header goes over. 52 min: Ste in NY is, like me, still thinking about ice cream \u2013 \u201cIn ice cream related news, just got back from Vermont \u2013 Bourbon Brown Butter at the Ben and Jerry\u2019s factory, complete with mini dark chocolate liqueur cups, followed by White Lightning at Bromley Mountain \u2013 dark chocolate ice cream with a streak of peppermint. (Think frozen After Eights.) Of course ice cream\u2019s off the menu right now, as it\u2019s Friday afternoon, and time for a Bronx Brewery Double India Pale Ale. 10.1%. Get your own, thish onesh mine.\u201d When you said \u201cWhite Lightning\u201d I thought of something very different for a moment. In non-ice cream news, Calvert-Lewin is booked for going in late on Wesley. 50 min: Everton have begun the half with purpose but, as earlier, scant penetration. 47 min: Sigurdsson looks to play Calvert-Lewin through after a decent move, but it just clips the striker\u2019s heel. There is a lot to like in Calvert-Lewin\u2019s game but will he ever score enough? No changes at the break, which is a slight surprise Everton-wise. So, back out come the players. Can Everton turn this around? Will Villa get off the mark for the season? Your half-time reading is this important piece from Paul MacInnes: Pretty but ultimately toothless from Everton, even if Calvert-Lewin should probably have equalised. Villa did nothing for 20 minutes but then Wesley scored a very smart goal and they\u2019ve been much the better side since, looking a few gears quicker than their opposition. All to play for after the break! 45 min: Grealish tries to bend one into the far corner but it flies wide. Villa are operating with such purpose now and Everton\u2019s previously solid back line looks very shaky. 44 min: Andre Gomes leathered one out of play a minute ago and has now miscontrolled one out of play. He\u2019s not been quite up to his usual high standards so far. Mine and Wesley have a little exchange of words while we mull over that, requiring a talking-to from Oliver. 41 min: Bernard does show some decent pace to get away down the left, now, but his cross on the stretch is dealt with. 40 min: Everton have been smart in possession, sure, but perhaps a little one-paced at times. Could we see Kean or Iwobi after the break? 37 min: Guilbert advances in a more central area now and, with the defence backing off, decides to have a pop. A different decision would have been better as it\u2019s well off target. But Villa are looking good now. 36 min: Wesley tees up Grealish well, but his shot is deflected and Pickford manages to stop it dribbling behind. 35 min: Guilbert shows a smart attacking turn of pace but Heaton has little problem taking his cross, which nobody is attacking. Villa have nice speed when they attack. 32 min: Engels saves Villa! A perceptive Schneiderlin ball plays Coleman into space on the right of the area and his first-time lay-off puts it on the plate for Calvert-Lewin. The net seems set to bulge but Engels gets in the way, right in front of the line, and punches the air in celebration. It was as important as a goal, that; and should really have been one for Everton. 30 min: There was, by the way, a pause after the goal while a VAR check took place \u2013 even though even I could see it was fine \u2013 because football is for pen-pushers, pedants, bores and bureaucrats now. 28 min: Everton look rattled by that; the game had been played entirely in Villa\u2019s half til the goal but now the reverse is true. 25 min: McGinn drills a low, volleyed cross from the left byline but Pickford gathers. Villa, barely in it for 20 minutes, are a team transformed. 24 min: Villa repeat exactly the same move, Jota playing Wesley through again! It\u2019s a slightly, but not much, harder chance and Wesley delays just long enough for a sliding Mina to get back and block his shot. Their first real moment of danger, and their striker\u2019s first goal! Grealish wins a free-kick inside his own half and the ball is worked quickly to Jota. He plays a wonderful reverse pass through to Wesley, who has run across the line and is clearly onside. The finish is low, clinical, and Villa Park erupts! It\u2019s totally against the run of play. 20 min: Not really; Everton keep up the pressure. But Jota draws applause with a nice little pirouette and move upfield to get them out of a little bother. 19 min: A first sighting of Villa, Wesley heading well over from an offside position. Can they build on that? 18 min: \u201cMings is a menace!\u201d cries JR in Illinois. \u201cOn that first play where he went down in a heap he wasn\u2019t even looking at the ball. He was just trying to knock Calvert-Lewin out of the air. Then he almost kicks his teammates\u2019 head off. Usually it\u2019s opponents\u2019 heads he\u2019s stamping on [that\u2019s a reference to the infamous Ibrahimovic incident] but Engels is going to have to learn to keep his melon away from the floor with Mings around.\u201d 16 min: Everton look smooth. They advance again into space on the left, with Bernard eventually delivering just above Richarlison\u2019s head at the back post. Guilbert has not had the best debut so far at right-back. 14 min: Villa really haven\u2019t got into this at all yet. They cede possession again. It\u2019s all a little rushed and direct from them. 12 min: It almost brings a goal, Sigurdsson floating it to the edge of the box for Digne to volley. It\u2019s blocked and then Mings has to get in the way of Keane\u2019s close-range follow-up. There was an offside in there somewhere, it turns out. 11 min: Yes, Engels is back and is ready to make his marx, etcetera. He actually does, sort of, deflecting a dangerous Richarlison shot out for another corner. 10 min: Ooof. This time it\u2019s Mings dishing out a blow, belting the ball away while Engels, his teammate, stoops to head it back to Heaton. Thing is, he gives Engels a clobbering too. Mings probably knew Engels was unlikely to get good purchase on the ball, with Everton forwards looming, and felt he had to take urgent action. But Engels is flat out on the floor and needs a good minute or so of treatment before getting up; assuming he comes through the concussion protocols we\u2019ll see him again soon. 8 min: Patient possession from Everton sees Villa eventually sweep up a Bernard cross. But the away side have definitely started the better here. 6 min: A slick backheel from Sigurdsson sets Richarlison scampering into the area, with Grealish tailing him. He tumbles over as his opponents gets close ... penalty? Nope, says Michael Oliver, despite Everton\u2019s appeals. 5 min: Guilbert gets a debut yellow card for tugging back Bernard on halfway. Villa gave the ball away in order for that to happen, not for the first time. 3 min: Digne wins a corner from McGinn after another good Everton foray. The centre-backs are both up. Digne outswings it, but it\u2019s cleared at the near post and then Heaton punches away from Bernard\u2019s ball back in. Mings, in the wars already tonight, takes a thwack from his keeper in the process but should be alright. 1 min: Mings looks well enough as he nips in to intercept Richarlison\u2019s ball for Calvert-Lewin after a lively Everton break. Villa kick off and shoot left to right. Mings is necking a Red Bull. When I played at uni I\u2019d sometimes neck two of those before a game. What was I playing at? Once it got me so keyed up to charge into aerial contests that within 10 minutes of kick-off I was being sent to A&amp;E with my head split open. Word to the wise there, Tyrone! Anyway, the players are out and the atmosphere is belting. Paul Mills writes in response to my ice cream plea: \u201cLast week, while on holiday in Ullapool, the 4 of us in my household enjoyed an unsurpassable homemade raspberry and elderflower sorbet from the Gelato shop so much, we returned for a repeat order yesterday. The fabulously flame-haired and very friendly ice cream seller took one look at us on entry and said \u2018Ah, it\u2019s the sorbet family\u2019. Which is a name we are happy to keep.\u201d Lovely stuff. And lucky you \u2013 Ullapool is beautiful! Mings does start \u2013 confirmation just in. He and the other 21 hopefuls will emerge shortly. In a quick hop to other news \u2013 last-ditch hope for Bury, who are a little over four hours from extinction as things stand? Tyrone Mings had a little problem in the warm-up there ... looks as if he should be OK but if there\u2019s any news to the contrary, I\u2019ll let you know. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a word you definitely shouldn\u2019t say to Smith. It\u2019s the F word! Yerry Mina and Richarlison both start today but Silva has had a word in their ears \u2013 in English! Lovely warm evening, isn\u2019t it? I took a little stroll along the canal to Camden before settling down to spend a few hours with you lovely people. In doing so I consumed an ice cream with one scoop marzipan flavour, one scoop mint &amp; cucumber flavour. Respectively I found them a little bit overbearing and a little bit icy/watery. Anyone enjoyed a weird ice cream flavour today? Told you this one gives us a fuzzy feeling. Marco Silva: \u201cOur goal is to do better than last season, it\u2019s something we must do. It\u2019s too early to talk about the top six or whatever, we have to prove it on the pitch every week.\u201d \u201c[Moise Kean will start a match] when he shows me in the training sessions that he is ready to, and is in a better moment than the others. We have to give him time. But sometimes a players can be decisive in 30 minutes.\u201d Villa boss Dean Smith speaks: \u201cIt feels a little bit odd the way we\u2019ve played that we\u2019ve got nothing, but we\u2019re only two games in. Our performances on the whole have been OK without being top performances but we felt we could have got something out of both games.\u201d \u201cWe get talked about as an established club in the Premier League club, probably because of how much we\u2019ve spent, but it was always going to be a rebuild whether we were in the Premier League or the Championship.\u201d Aston Villa: Heaton, Guilbert, Engels, Mings, Taylor, Douglas Luiz, Trezeguet, McGinn, Grealish, Jota, Wesley. Subs: Lansbury, Steer, Hourihane, Konsa, El Ghazi, Elmohamady, Davis. Everton: Pickford, Coleman, Keane, Mina, Digne, Schneiderlin, Andre Gomes, Richarlison, Sigurdsson, Bernard, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Holgate, Walcott, Iwobi, Sidibe, Stekelenburg, Davies, Kean. Guilbert makes his debut for Villa at right-back. Jota also comes in. Schneiderlin gets a start for Everton, whose bench looks decent there, in place of Gbamin \u2013 the reason for whose absence is currently unclear. Friday night football ahoy! And this one\u2019s the equivalent of a cosy evening under a rug with a glass of something nice. It\u2019s Villa v Everton \u2013 two familiar, old-world Premier League names, both relatively unthreatening and usually *there*. Well, that wasn\u2019t quite the case during Villa\u2019s recent stint in the Championship but they\u2019re back now and gunning for mid-table stability in the short term. They haven\u2019t quite looked set for that yet, defeats at Spurs and \u2013 more disappointingly \u2013 at home to Bournemouth making for an inauspicious start and leading to a few concerned mentions of the \u201cFulham\u201d word. Villa revamped their squad at great expense over the summer; has it been too much change, too soon? We might get a better idea when they face an Everton side that are starting to settle down nicely under Marco Silva. It\u2019s not been scintillating, but a single-goal win over Watford and zero-zero at Palace were just fine. They\u2019re eyeing a real shot at the big boys this season and a win tonight would suggest they might have what it takes. So snuggle up and let\u2019s get into this one.

The old Etonian (he never fails to mention it) has always been a fine joke writer and constructor of routines, with an identifiable, if familiar, persona \u2013 that of the Hugh Grant-alike awkward toff, dressing up his enfeeblement in decorous gentility. Graham just needed to let rip a bit \u2013 and he does so here (if only a bit), with a bigger-hitting set on new parenthood, which has been nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy award.

His detractors argue these deficit worries are hyperbole and a result of the US\u2019s stronger economy, which allows consumers to buy goods at cheaper prices. The truth is probably somewhere in between. While it\u2019s true that unemployment is at record lows and consumers continue to prop up the economy, manufacturing jobs have been lost (automation is also to blame for this) and with them wage growth (although the hollowing out of unions plays a part here).

      "body": "<p>Shaun Hanns is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/shaun-hanns\">a former public servant</a> who worked until recently in the refugee assessment program at home affairs. Last October he left his job to raise concerns about current government policy. He wrote a 10-page paper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/25/former-home-affairs-official-begs-mps-to-remove-asylum-seekers-from-nauru\">which he sent to federal parliamentarians</a>, urging them to interrogate the claims sitting behind Australia\u2019s border protection regime, rather than be party to a set and forget exercise.</p> <p>More recently, he\u2019s written a submission to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/04/peter-duttons-move-to-abolish-medevac-regime-delayed-by-senate-inquiry\">a Senate inquiry into the medevac repeal</a>. If you\u2019ve missed the whole medevac debate, it\u2019s easy enough to summarise. Last year, when Scott Morrison governed in minority, crossbenchers, Labor and the Greens succeeded in overhauling the transfer processes for dangerously ill people on Nauru and Manus Island. Clinicians were given more of a say.</p> <p>Now that Morrison governs in majority, the prime minister wants to repeal the bill that passed the parliament against the government\u2019s wishes. The government also wants to use the process of repealing medevac as an opportunity to extend its powers to return people offshore once their medical issues have been resolved. The proposal to enhance the return powers has flown largely under the radar in the debate to date.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/23/coalition-has-lost-control-of-borders-with-80000-asylum-arrivals-by-plane-labor-says\">Coalition has lost control of borders, with 80,000 asylum arrivals by plane, Labor says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hanns has told the Senate inquiry that parliamentarians should keep the crossbench-initiated medevac procedures as \u201cthe first step in an attempt to reform the system so that it is not only effective, but as humane as possible, whilst maintaining that effectiveness\u201d.</p> <p>One bit of compelling logic stood out to me when I read his written submission before it was made public by the committee this week. Hanns said the lived experience of the medevac regime gives policymakers in Canberra important information they should not ignore.</p> <p>Medevac working effectively demonstrated that Australia\u2019s overall deterrence regime \u201cneed not rely on a logic of cruelty in order to be effective\u201d. The experience of the past six months showed \u201cthere is significantly more leeway to change the system without undermining border protection than previously assumed\u201d.</p> <p>You might need a minute or two to process these insights, not because they are particularly complex, but because we don\u2019t always take the time to analyse what\u2019s happening. We don\u2019t reflect on the fact our government, and governments before the current one, use (and have used) cruelty deliberately, institutionally, as a matter of policy, to assert our sovereignty, and dissuade asylum seekers from coming to Australia by boat.</p> <p>We don\u2019t tend to think about this for two reasons.

      "bodyText": "Shaun Hanns is a former public servant who worked until recently in the refugee assessment program at home affairs. Last October he left his job to raise concerns about current government policy. He wrote a 10-page paper, which he sent to federal parliamentarians, urging them to interrogate the claims sitting behind Australia\u2019s border protection regime, rather than be party to a set and forget exercise. More recently, he\u2019s written a submission to a Senate inquiry into the medevac repeal. If you\u2019ve missed the whole medevac debate, it\u2019s easy enough to summarise. Last year, when Scott Morrison governed in minority, crossbenchers, Labor and the Greens succeeded in overhauling the transfer processes for dangerously ill people on Nauru and Manus Island. Clinicians were given more of a say. Now that Morrison governs in majority, the prime minister wants to repeal the bill that passed the parliament against the government\u2019s wishes. The government also wants to use the process of repealing medevac as an opportunity to extend its powers to return people offshore once their medical issues have been resolved. The proposal to enhance the return powers has flown largely under the radar in the debate to date. Hanns has told the Senate inquiry that parliamentarians should keep the crossbench-initiated medevac procedures as \u201cthe first step in an attempt to reform the system so that it is not only effective, but as humane as possible, whilst maintaining that effectiveness\u201d. One bit of compelling logic stood out to me when I read his written submission before it was made public by the committee this week. Hanns said the lived experience of the medevac regime gives policymakers in Canberra important information they should not ignore. Medevac working effectively demonstrated that Australia\u2019s overall deterrence regime \u201cneed not rely on a logic of cruelty in order to be effective\u201d. The experience of the past six months showed \u201cthere is significantly more leeway to change the system without undermining border protection than previously assumed\u201d. You might need a minute or two to process these insights, not because they are particularly complex, but because we don\u2019t always take the time to analyse what\u2019s happening. We don\u2019t reflect on the fact our government, and governments before the current one, use (and have used) cruelty deliberately, institutionally, as a matter of policy, to assert our sovereignty, and dissuade asylum seekers from coming to Australia by boat. We don\u2019t tend to think about this for two reasons. The first is it all happens out of our sight. The second is a self-protective mechanism: if we remember that institutional cruelty is deployed on our behalf, it triggers moral discomfort. So I\u2019d recommend you give yourself a minute to mentally step through Hanns\u2019s analysis: the medevac procedures have not led to the sky falling in, so perhaps we don\u2019t need to be quite as terrible to our fellow human beings as we thought we needed to be in order to stop the boats. It feels like a truth bomb when you take the time to process it. Truth bomb or not, the Department of Home Affairs isn\u2019t showing much inclination to listen to the suggestion from one of its former operatives. As could have been predicted, the department remains resolutely of the view that when it comes to determining policy, it is their way, or the highway. Home affairs argues in its submission the medevac regime undermines regional processing, undermines security and impinges on the sovereignty of Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Strangely, given there is a wealth of evidence that the mental health crisis on Nauru and Manus Island has actually been years in the making, (and this could have been predicted, given, to quote the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, \u201cprolonged or indefinite detention itself is known to contribute to adverse mental health outcomes as a result of prolonged exposure to factors including uncertainty, lack of autonomy, deprivation of liberty, dehumanisation, isolation and lack of social support\u201d) \u2013 the department suggests in its submission that medevac has somehow been a tipping point. There is a claim (presented as a \u201cconcern\u201d) that people are self-harming in order to get a medical transfer. The submission notes that during late 2018 and through 2019 \u201cthere has been an upwards trend in the number of self-harm related incidents amongst the Papua New Guinea cohort\u201d. \u201cNotably, self-harm incidents increased during the parliamentary debate on [medevac], and more significantly since the Australian federal election,\u201d the submission says. \u201cOf the 72 transitory persons transferred to Australia \u2026 39 had undertaken an act of self-harm and 19 had threatened self-harm since the implementation of [medevac]\u201d. Then there\u2019s the kicker. \u201cHome affairs is concerned that self-harm is perceived as the most expedient means of accessing medical transfer under the provisions.\u201d The department says it has always cared about the health of the people on Nauru and Manus, it has spent hundreds of millions delivering services, and is working with service providers to implement enhanced mental health services. It notes that in April 2019 the Pacific international hospital expanded its operation in Port Moresby and opened an enhanced mental health facility specifically for the transitory person caseload. It is reassuring that home affairs professes to be concerned about the risks of self-harm, but the picture the submission presents is \u2013 how can I put this politely? Somewhat selective. Overlooked in the commentary is the findings of the Queensland coroner Terry Ryan. Ryan found in July 2018 that the death of Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei from complications after an infection was preventable. The coroner recommended that doctors treating asylum seekers and refugees on offshore islands should have control of patient transfers to hospital care in Australia. Importantly, the UNHCR has noted of that case: \u201cThe report of the Queensland state coroner in relation to the death of Hamid Kehazaei demonstrates that insufficiently transparent and accountable procedures for acting upon serious health concerns can have life-threatening and tragic consequences\u201d. Also not mentioned: important work by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res released last December documenting that Nauru was in the grips of a mental health crisis. MSF reported a dangerous mental health crisis had been developing on Nauru for at least four years. Just for background, MSF provided free psychological and psychiatric treatment to Nauruan nationals as well as refugees and asylum seekers sent to the island until the Nauruan government informed the organisation in October 2018 that its services were no longer required and must cease within 24 hours. Also not mentioned: an unusual personal appeal from the president of the Australian Medical Association to Scott Morrison last September to remove families and children from Nauru, preferably to the Australian mainland, to safeguard their physical and mental health. Guardian Australia revealed Tony Bartone wrote to Morrison because of \u201ca recent groundswell of concern and agitation across the AMA membership and the medical profession about conditions on Nauru, and the escalation in reports of catastrophic mental and physical health conditions being experienced by the asylum seekers, especially children\u201d. The AMA is standing behind the medevac regime, and urging the government to properly fund the work of the independent health advisory panel that provides the advice on medical transfers. The fate of the medevac regime rests with one parliamentarian, the Tasmanian independent Jacqui Lambie, who has told the government she wants the Senate inquiry to play out before she makes a decision. Nobody really knows which way Lambie will jump, but she\u2019s the make-or-break player. Hearings associated with the inquiry begin next week. The critical vote is expected in November.

      "bodyText": "Angus Taylor did not declare at a meeting with environment officials about critically endangered grasslands that he had a financial interest in a company that was under investigation for poisoning them. And no notes were taken by the senior department official who attended the meeting in 2017, a Senate committee has heard. Officials from the environment and energy department gave the evidence at a special hearing of the Senate\u2019s inquiry into the extinction crisis on Friday. The hearing focused on grasslands and, specifically, a March 2017 meeting between Taylor, senior officials and the office of the then environment minister Josh Frydenberg to discuss the federal government\u2019s designation of the critically endangered grasslands known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands. At the time the meeting occurred, New South Wales and federal investigations were under way into the poisoning of about 30 hectares that contained the grasses on a property in the state\u2019s Monaro region owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. One of the directors of that company is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. At Friday\u2019s hearing, the department\u2019s chief compliance officer, Monica Collins, told senators she was aware before the March 2017 meeting of Angus Taylor\u2019s familial connection to Richard Taylor. But she took on notice whether the compliance team investigating the case was also aware of the minister\u2019s financial interest in Jam Land. \u201cWe were aware that Angus Taylor was the brother of one of the directors of the land we were investigating,\u201d she said. Collins also confirmed the investigation of Jam Land was the only compliance case involving these grasslands. Geoff Richardson, the assistant secretary of the department\u2019s protected species and communities branch, was one of the officials at the March 2017 meeting. He told the hearing Taylor did not disclose his business interest at the start of the meeting. \u201cDid Minister Taylor declare ahead of that meeting his business interests in Jam Land?\u201d the Labor senator Katy Gallagher asked. \u201cNo senator, there was no interest disclosed at the start of that meeting but the meeting was about the listing of the grassland,\u201d Richardson replied. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that was relevant?,\u201d Gallagher asked. \u201cI don\u2019t have a view, senator,\u201d Richardson said.

Shortly afterwards, a number of messages \u2013 some purporting to be from Manchester United fans \u2013 appeared on Twitter abusing Pogba. They used the \u201cn\u201d word, replaced Pogba\u2019s face in photographs with that of a gorilla, and told him to \u201cgo back to selling bananas in Colombia\u201d. Soon enough, the tweets were called out by United fans and reported to Twitter. The next morning United <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/20/paul-pogba-manchester-united-racially-abused-penalty-twitter-wolves-disgusted\" title=\"\">issued a statement</a> condemning the messages: \u201cThe individuals who expressed these views do not represent the values of our great club.\u201d A number of United players posted messages in solidarity with Pogba and the issue of racist abuse on social media platforms became a public talking point.</p> \n<h2><strong>How bad is the problem?</strong></h2> \n<p>It is almost impossible to quantify, but the situation is certainly not good. The abuse directed at Pogba was not even the first high\u2011profile example of the season, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/15/kick-it-out-call-to-action-chelsea-tammy-abraham-racial-abuse-social-media\" title=\"\">Chelsea\u2019s Tammy Abraham</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/20/yakou-meite-interview\" title=\"\">Reading\u2019s Yakou M\u00e9\u00efte</a> having already been targeted. The anti\u2011racism organisation Kick It Out has attempted to calculate the total number of such posts and in 2015 produced a study that found 134,000 abusive messages had been sent to football players and clubs from August 2014 to March 2015. The number of discriminatory incidents on social media reported to Kick it Out has since grown to record levels.

The company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/21/kick-it-out-twitter-racial-abuse\" title=\"\">has agreed to meet</a> United, Kick it Out and \u201cother civil society stakeholders\u201d in the coming weeks to discuss what plans the company has for taking more proactive action against racists.</p> \n<h2><strong>What are the proposed solutions?</strong></h2> \n<p>United\u2019s Harry Maguire tweeted one possible course of action: \u201cEvery account that is opened should be verified by a passport/driving licence,\u201d he wrote. The England Women\u2019s coach, Phil Neville, suggested a six-month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/20/phil-neville-calls-for-social-media-boycott-to-combat-racist-abuse\" title=\"\">boycott of social media</a> by clubs and players. Twitter\u2019s proposed course of action is more iterative, looking to beef up its reporting and suspension processes. The company talks about having tripled the number of accounts banned within 24 hours of being reported, and increased the number of messages \u201csurfaced proactively for human review\u201d. The company would not confirm how many humans it has doing the reviewing, and admits \u201cprogress in this space is tough\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>How likely are the solutions to work?</strong></h2> \n<p>This is where it becomes complicated. Twitter\u2019s policies have many critics, especially among people of colour and other minorities on the sharp end of abuse. One common complaint involves the terms of <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy\" title=\"\">Twitter\u2019s \u201chateful conduct policy\u201d</a>. There are areas here that could be tightened up but, increasingly, there is a sense among Twitter\u2019s critics that more must be done.</p> \n<p>Bigger changes such as that suggested by Maguire have their own challenges, however. Presenting identification would require new complicated systems not only to process identification but verify it. The end of anonymity (even if it still existed at the user level) would impact on everyone from whistleblowers to, once again, vulnerable minorities who might be more reluctant to speak their mind. Finally, and perhaps most obviously, would the idea of handing crucial pieces of information over to tech companies be popular with the public?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e05d4115ca66bf93c60b2b1cebd03ff6b5d2b078\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e05d4115ca66bf93c60b2b1cebd03ff6b5d2b078/78_67_1530_918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Maguire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United\u2019s Harry Maguire suggested that all Twitter uses verify their identity, though would people be happy to hand over their personal information?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Why is this proving so complex?</strong></h2> \n<p>There are several things in tension with each other, the most glaring of which is an apparently public forum actually being a privately owned platform. The needs of society are not always aligned with Twitter\u2019s interests as a business. However, the company admits that \u201cthis behaviour harms the Twitter experience for everyone\u201d, and says \u201cwe remain deeply committed to improving the health of the conversation on the service\u201d.</p> \n<p>Another conflict is obviously that between one person\u2019s right to freedom of speech and another\u2019s right to live their life in peace. Some of this comes down to context, not just the language used but what it appears in conjunction with and when. Is a gorilla\u2019s face hateful? Not in and of itself, but when pasted on to the body of a human being, the message it sends is different and clear.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"60411c24-d5c9-497b-a37d-fa77797bf6c8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nvodHoHak4E?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>What is the best hope for change?</strong></h2> \n<p>At this point it seems unlikely Twitter will do anything other than promise to do more, more quickly, and perhaps clarify or alter parts of its \u201chateful conduct policy\u201d. Stemming the apparent ease with which banned users can reappear under a new alias would also be welcome. It remains to be seen whether this will prove enough to appease critics, who are likely then to demand action from government.</p> \n<p>One further thing that could be done is to increase the number of legal prosecutions. At the time of writing, Greater Manchester Police are yet to receive a complaint about the messages directed at Pogba and are therefore not investigating. Online hate crime is thought to be seriously under-reported, but prosecutions are growing, have a high rate of success and stiffer sentences are being delivered. One way of tackling online hate would be to enforce real world consequences.</p>",

Some of this comes down to context, not just the language used but what it appears in conjunction with and when. Is a gorilla\u2019s face hateful? Not in and of itself, but when pasted on to the body of a human being, the message it sends is different and clear. What is the best hope for change? At this point it seems unlikely Twitter will do anything other than promise to do more, more quickly, and perhaps clarify or alter parts of its \u201chateful conduct policy\u201d. Stemming the apparent ease with which banned users can reappear under a new alias would also be welcome. It remains to be seen whether this will prove enough to appease critics, who are likely then to demand action from government. One further thing that could be done is to increase the number of legal prosecutions. At the time of writing, Greater Manchester Police are yet to receive a complaint about the messages directed at Pogba and are therefore not investigating. Online hate crime is thought to be seriously under-reported, but prosecutions are growing, have a high rate of success and stiffer sentences are being delivered. One way of tackling online hate would be to enforce real world consequences.",

One year on the world No 1 returns to the scene of her signature triumph beset by injury and weighed down by an entirely new set of expectations but no less empowered by the quiet confidence that has lifted her to the summit of women\u2019s tennis. The 21-year-old enters among the shortlist of betting favourites as the defending champion and top seed in the women\u2019s draw at the tournament, which kicks off here on Monday morning. But since backing up last year\u2019s breakthrough run at Flushing Meadows compellingly with an Australian Open title in January that lifted her to the top of the WTA rankings, Osaka has weathered an extended rocky patch including early exits at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, followed by a knee injury that cut short a crucial runway event in the Cincinnati quarter-finals. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed for me,\u201d Osaka said on Friday of her whirlwind 50-week journey since last year\u2019s US Open. \u201cI took a break and relaxed my mind and realised that you have to have fun doing what you love.

The new offering is thus something of a rarity. And it is an alternative to Chick-fil-A, whose deliciousness was years ago spoiled by homophobia. In 2012, its CEO, Dan Cathy, condemned gay marriage, and his family has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/5/29/18644354/chick-fil-a-anti-gay-donations-homophobia-dan-cathy\">donated generously to anti-gay groups</a>, dooming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/30/better-than-chick-fil-a-what-to-eat-when-you-crave-both-chicken-and-equal-rights\">concerned fast-food fans</a> to subpar offerings.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just scarcity and ethics that have driven hordes to the sandwich. Popeyes has done a remarkable job promoting it on social media, drawing competitors into an extended sandwich spat. The clever marketing meant that with every angry retort, Popeyes rivals were actually promoting the sandwich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"68433ddce760b4c11aa98b1e7c363dc9e4db92af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68433ddce760b4c11aa98b1e7c363dc9e4db92af/161_546_2863_2863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign at a Popeyes in Oakland announced the news: sold out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign at a Popeyes in Oakland announced the news: sold out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, Popeyes tweeted a post alleging that the sandwich was good. Soon after, Chick-fil-A highlighted what it described as \u201cthe original\u201d sandwich, leading to some sarcasm from Popeyes: \u201cY\u2019all good?\u201d Wendy\u2019s soon weighed in: \u201cY\u2019all out here fighting about which of these fools has the second best chicken sandwich,\u201d which led to another back and forth. By the end, Shake Shack had jumped into the fray with a joke about the \u201cbeef\u201d between the chicken vendors.</p> <p>The exchange sparked both <a href=\"https://thetakeout.com/popeyes-wendys-chick-fil-a-chicken-sandwich-twitter-spa-1837404515\">annoyance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/business/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-twitter.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email#\">admiration</a>, but either way it appears to have worked. And on a recent visit to a Popeyes location in downtown Oakland, the lunchtime line had stretched 30 deep by noon. Many had arrived just to try the sandwich.</p> <p>\u201cAfter seeing it on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, I had to come,\u201d said Anthony Wilson, 32, while waiting to order. \u201cSix people at work came in with one for lunch yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson said he wasn\u2019t normally a fan of Popeyes but that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to miss out on a cultural phenomenon\u201d.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t Wilson\u2019s lucky day. As customers approached the counter, a hand-written sign tacked near the register announced: \u201cSorry sold out of the chicken sandwich.\u201d</p> <p>News spread through the line like a chicken feather on the wind as patrons grumbled and shouted \u2013 \u201cNo more chicken sandwich? Why do you think we came here?!\u201d \u2013 and some walked off, admitting defeat.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only had the sandwich a week and it\u2019s been selling out every day. Some people come in and order 10,\u201d said Nayeli Vasquez, a 23-year-old employee.</p> <p>She added that the outlet was making around 300 sandwiches per day, with supplies usually completely selling out by the evening. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a menu item this popular.\u201d</p> <p>After a 40-minute wait, sandwiches were made available again. So did they live up to the hype? Well, it\u2019s probably not going to save America and it bears only a passing resemblance to true love, but it is very, very good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F7456f36f526ebfafa24ca01a8fce3670e704010c%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4032_3024&amp;left-caption=A%20Popeyes%20fried%20chicken%20sandwich%2C%20ready%20for%20tasting.%20Source%3A%20Alastair%20Gee%20for%20the%20Guardian&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5b79e2ca02d3a1f8ff47ba2e0fa5644d408dcd75%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4032_3024&amp;right-caption=The%20meal%20was%20delicious%2C%20but%20led%20to%20a%20sluggishness%20and%20regret.%20Source%3A%20Alastair%20Gee%20for%20the%20Guardian&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"popeyes\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F7456f36f526ebfafa24ca01a8fce3670e704010c%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4032_3024&left-caption=A%20Popeyes%20fried%20chicken%20sandwich%2C%20ready%20for%20tasting.%20Source%3A%20Alastair%20Gee%20for%20the%20Guardian&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5b79e2ca02d3a1f8ff47ba2e0fa5644d408dcd75%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4032_3024&right-caption=The%20meal%20was%20delicious%2C%20but%20led%20to%20a%20sluggishness%20and%20regret.%20Source%3A%20Alastair%20Gee%20for%20the%20Guardian&always-place-captions-below=false\">popeyes</a> </figure>  <p>The meat itself is tender, deliciously contrasting with the crispy exterior.

First of all, Popeyes, despite its half-century of history \u2013 the first restaurant opened in the early 1970s in New Orleans \u2013 is not known for sandwiches. The new offering is thus something of a rarity. And it is an alternative to Chick-fil-A, whose deliciousness was years ago spoiled by homophobia. In 2012, its CEO, Dan Cathy, condemned gay marriage, and his family has donated generously to anti-gay groups, dooming concerned fast-food fans to subpar offerings. But it\u2019s not just scarcity and ethics that have driven hordes to the sandwich. Popeyes has done a remarkable job promoting it on social media, drawing competitors into an extended sandwich spat. The clever marketing meant that with every angry retort, Popeyes rivals were actually promoting the sandwich. First, Popeyes tweeted a post alleging that the sandwich was good. Soon after, Chick-fil-A highlighted what it described as \u201cthe original\u201d sandwich, leading to some sarcasm from Popeyes: \u201cY\u2019all good?\u201d Wendy\u2019s soon weighed in: \u201cY\u2019all out here fighting about which of these fools has the second best chicken sandwich,\u201d which led to another back and forth. By the end, Shake Shack had jumped into the fray with a joke about the \u201cbeef\u201d between the chicken vendors. The exchange sparked both annoyance and admiration, but either way it appears to have worked. And on a recent visit to a Popeyes location in downtown Oakland, the lunchtime line had stretched 30 deep by noon. Many had arrived just to try the sandwich. \u201cAfter seeing it on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, I had to come,\u201d said Anthony Wilson, 32, while waiting to order. \u201cSix people at work came in with one for lunch yesterday.\u201d Wilson said he wasn\u2019t normally a fan of Popeyes but that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to miss out on a cultural phenomenon\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t Wilson\u2019s lucky day. As customers approached the counter, a hand-written sign tacked near the register announced: \u201cSorry sold out of the chicken sandwich.\u201d News spread through the line like a chicken feather on the wind as patrons grumbled and shouted \u2013 \u201cNo more chicken sandwich? Why do you think we came here?!\u201d \u2013 and some walked off, admitting defeat. \u201cWe\u2019ve only had the sandwich a week and it\u2019s been selling out every day. Some people come in and order 10,\u201d said Nayeli Vasquez, a 23-year-old employee. She added that the outlet was making around 300 sandwiches per day, with supplies usually completely selling out by the evening. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a menu item this popular.\u201d After a 40-minute wait, sandwiches were made available again. So did they live up to the hype? Well, it\u2019s probably not going to save America and it bears only a passing resemblance to true love, but it is very, very good. The meat itself is tender, deliciously contrasting with the crispy exterior. The bun is sweet without being overpowering, and the simple mayo-pickle combination complements the spices in the batter. The whole thing is delightfully squishy, in a way that is maybe a little gross but also makes it easy to eat. (NB: This is a review of the \u201cclassic\u201d edition of the sandwich, which apparently earned its name despite only having existed a few weeks. There is also a \u201cspicy\u201d version.) A few hours after eating the sandwich, however, taste testers were grappling with nausea, sluggishness, and the guilt that accompanies a fast-food binge. But they didn\u2019t regret the decision: now they knew what all the fuss was about.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cA spy has to be an actor, but an actor that doesn\u2019t need a public or a stage, and doesn\u2019t require the approval of others,\u201d says Elena Vavilova, as she sips a cappuccino in a Moscow cafe.</p> <p>Vavilova acted the part of a Canadian woman named Tracy Foley, an identity stolen for her by the KGB, for two decades. Almost no one knew her real identity, not even her own children. She was an \u201cillegal\u201d, a deep-cover Russian operative sent to the west along with her husband Andrei Bezrukov, who used the name Donald Heathfield.</p> <p>Vavilova and Bezrukov were arrested at their Boston home in 2010, part of a group of 10 Russian spies detained by the FBI, most of them illegals living in the US as ordinary Americans or Canadians. They were deported to Russia in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/09/russian-spies-swap-us\">a spy swap</a> that included media favourite Anna Chapman and also involved four Russians accused of spying for the west travelling in the other direction, including Sergei Skripal, who was infamously poisoned in Salisbury last year.</p> <p>Vavilova has written a fictionalised account of her spying career, called The Woman Who Can Keep Secrets, and agreed to meet the Guardian at a cafe in central Moscow, the first time any of the deep-cover illegals has spoken to non-Russian media since their return to the country.</p> <p>The book provides rare insight into the illegals programme, which was set up by the Soviet Union but continued in modern Russia.

      "bodyText": "\u201cA spy has to be an actor, but an actor that doesn\u2019t need a public or a stage, and doesn\u2019t require the approval of others,\u201d says Elena Vavilova, as she sips a cappuccino in a Moscow cafe. Vavilova acted the part of a Canadian woman named Tracy Foley, an identity stolen for her by the KGB, for two decades. Almost no one knew her real identity, not even her own children. She was an \u201cillegal\u201d, a deep-cover Russian operative sent to the west along with her husband Andrei Bezrukov, who used the name Donald Heathfield. Vavilova and Bezrukov were arrested at their Boston home in 2010, part of a group of 10 Russian spies detained by the FBI, most of them illegals living in the US as ordinary Americans or Canadians. They were deported to Russia in a spy swap that included media favourite Anna Chapman and also involved four Russians accused of spying for the west travelling in the other direction, including Sergei Skripal, who was infamously poisoned in Salisbury last year. Vavilova has written a fictionalised account of her spying career, called The Woman Who Can Keep Secrets, and agreed to meet the Guardian at a cafe in central Moscow, the first time any of the deep-cover illegals has spoken to non-Russian media since their return to the country. The book provides rare insight into the illegals programme, which was set up by the Soviet Union but continued in modern Russia. Its characters, just like Vavilova and Bezrukov, are a couple who meet at Tomsk University in Siberia in the 1980s, are recruited by the KGB into the top-secret programme and spend years in training before they are dispatched to Canada and the US. The training includes long hours of language lessons to mimic native accents; evading surveillance, coding and other espionage tradecraft; and a period of living in a country house outside Moscow mocked up to mimic an US home, to help the young Siberians who had never travelled before learn about western life. In real life, Bezrukov and Vavilova married in the Soviet Union before departing, but they left for the west separately in the late 1980s, staged a meeting in Canada, began \u201cdating\u201d and then married for a second time, this time using their new, Canadian identities. They never spoke Russian together. Vavilova speaks perfect English, though with a noticeable Slavic accent. During her life in the west she claimed to be of French Canadian origin to explain the accent. The ideal illegal, she says, is someone who is average looking, does not attract attention and does not require external approval. During the final years before the arrests, when the couple were living in Boston, Vavilova worked as a estate agent, while sending regular coded messages back to controllers in Moscow. Much of the book is devoted to how the couple managed life with their two children. Vavilova and Bezrukov\u2019s sons Alex and Tim were 16 and 20 respectively when the FBI made their arrests in 2010, and both believed their parents to be ordinary Canadians. If Vavilova\u2019s story sounds familiar to fans of the US television series The Americans, it\u2019s because the creators based the show on the story of her family, though they moved the action back to the early 1980s.

Vavilova and Bezrukov used no violence and no disguises.

The boy, from east Yorkshire, reportedly got into difficulty in a lake in Berny-Rivi\u00e8re. He was found unconscious at about 6.30pm on Thursday and taken to hospital in Paris by helicopter but did not survive, according to local media. \u201cWe are supporting the family of a British child who has died in France and are in contact with the French authorities,\u201d a Foreign Office spokesman said on Friday. The boy and his family had been travelling with Kent-based tour operator Venue Holidays, who confirmed his death. La Croix du Vieux Pont campsite, in the Picardy region to the north-east of Paris, is owned by the European Camping Group and is popular with British holidaymakers. A spokeswoman for the group said it was \u201cdeeply touched\u201d to learn of the boy\u2019s death and expressed her \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d to his family. \u201cThe group and the camping management and its staff, shocked by this tragedy, are with the holidaymakers and a psychological support was set up, 24 hours a day, with an English-speaking French psychologist. \u201cThe group, for the first time confronted with a fatal accident on one of its sites, is collaborating with the authorities to shed light on the circumstances of the accident.\u201d \ufeffThe campsite\u2019s website says it is spread over 40 hectares (100 acres) with 660 camping plots and a heated pool complex, as well as a lake surrounded by a manmade beach.",

In fact I used to have a job with a uniform that was laundered and provided at work, and I did often show up to work in my pyjamas in those days. <br></p> <p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t really know or understand too much about the tactics and psychology of the batting order. I\u2019ve never really played cricket properly, bar a bit in a school and some back garden wonder series, and am wondering could you do a post about same? Or perhaps solicit input from more knowledgeable folk? Why is Roy not performing better? Confidence, or lack of skills? What is one looking for in an opener as opposed to a five or six? I guess I have a rather simplistic understanding of the game. Thanks in advance if you can shed some light for the less clued-in cricket fans amongst us.\u201d</p> <p>If the proper badgers will forgive a quick recap, then sure thing. Basically opening the batting is the hardest job, because the bowlers are fresh and the ball is new. This means that it is more likely to swing, because the lacquer is still on the ball. It is more likely to move off the seam, because the seam is new and hard. And it\u2019s more likely to bounce higher, because the ball is hard. As the ball gets softer, it usually does less for the bowler. So an opener\u2019s main job is to survive, but some openers can be counter-attacking and throw the bowlers into disarray by scoring quickly against the new ball.</p> <p>Batsmen at around four and five are supposed to be the long innings players who you build around, then six and seven can either save a tough situation, or attack from a strong position, and can bat with the tailenders effectively.</p> <p>Roy plays a high-risk style of game, which makes some low scores inevitable.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5fd8e28f081cf11cf1bb7e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-23T12:29:38.906Z\">1.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s some equally dispiriting news for England supporters, and cricket enthusiasts.

With the angle to the left-hander, he\u2019s able to stab a brace off his pads next ball.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-23T10:47:29.468Z\">at 11.47am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d5fc1e78f084061ab38b312\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-23T10:38:51.505Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>7th over: England 14-2 (Burns 5, Denly 0)</strong> Burns has just been watching from the other end as the chaos unfolds.

However, I had the pleasure of competing against Dalton Grant (obviously better known as a high jumper), who was the most lovely man you could ever meet. He was so friendly that he would be chatting to people as he was running down the runway and then, with his exception ability, still be able to sail out over 7 metres, which I had to absolutely bust my backside to achieve, not very frequently.

      "bodyText": "They probably won\u2019t be healed by the time the chase comes around ... Andy Bull on England\u2019s failings ... Geoff Lemon on bowling fast .... Not what Jofra had envisaged ... Vic Marks reports from Headingley ... 57th over: Australia 171-6 (Labuschagne 53, Pattinson 2) There\u2019s time for one more over, and it simply has to be bowled by Stokes. The crowd make a lot of noise but neither they, nor Stokes, can blow Labuschagne\u2019s house down. He\u2019s been immense, an understudy who has turned into Best Supporting Actor in the space of a week. England have stuck at it well but Australia lead by 283, which should be more than enough to win the match and retain the Ashes. Thanks for your company, your comments and your good humour, on another one of Those Days for English cricket. 56th over: Australia 170-6 (Labuschagne 52, Pattinson 2) Labuschagne spies a shortish one from Broad and shovels it into the shadows for two, to reach another fifty. Six days ago he had played no part in this series; now he\u2019s got three fifties, and 185 runs for twice out. He\u2019s been a revelation, as well as a pub-quiz question waiting to happen. 55th over: Australia 165-6 (Labuschagne 49, Pattinson 0) It\u2019s STILL Stokes, who is now using cricket as practice for his next career, running super-marathons. \u201cI know this is definitely left-field,\u201d says Ade Couper, \u201cbut how about Moeen for captain? Think he\u2019s captained Worcs, certainly in the white-ball stuff, I think he might really take to the role?\u201d Well, Ed Smith likes a bit of left-field... 54th over: Australia 164-6 (Labuschagne 48, Pattinson 0) Joy for Broad, who got a bit lucky there \u2013 the ball was going over the stumps. Maybe the gods have decided that this playing field needs a bit of levelling. Given out caught! There was an inside edge, which saved Paine from the LBW, but the ball had looped up to Denly in the gully, so he\u2019s out anyway. Are England inching back into this game? It\u2019s full, it\u2019s swinging in, it looks out... 53rd over: Australia 163-5 (Labuschagne 47, Paine 0) Before the wicket, Labuschagne played a chip for three, giving Archer a chance to stretch that cramped leg. A breakthrough at last for Stokes, who flicks Wade\u2019s glove as he plays no stroke. The relief is so great that Stokes sinks to the ground. 52nd over: Australia 156-4 (Labuschagne 44, Wade 29) Another tidy over from Broad, but still no breakthrough. The gonly crumb of comfort for England fans is that Archer is back on the field, minus the limp. \u201cWho makes way for Smith\u2019s return,\u201d asks Matt Briody, \u201cnow that Labuschagne has cemented his place?\u201d Harris or Khawaja \u2013 the Australian top order has been even worse than England\u2019s. Or Paine could decide that, with the Ashes in the bag, his job is done, and give the gloves to Wade. 51st over: Australia 155-4 (Labuschagne 43, Wade 29) Time for another bowling change, and it\u2019s... Stokes! Well, he\u2019s had at least six minutes off. And straightaway, reversing it from round the wicket, he has Labuschagne dropped by Bairstow, who changes direction well but can\u2019t cling on with one glove. \u201cWill no one think of the children??\u201d askeds Geoffrey Smith, a little earlier. \u201cHow am I supposed to raise my 5yo to respect Test cricket as the ultimate sporting contest when England serve up this rubbish? I suppose I could console us both with the thought that on current form, he should be batting somewhere between 1 and 5 in this line-up.\u201d 50th over: Australia 154-4 (Labuschagne 42, Wade 29) Here is Broad, replacing the valiant Stokes. His speed is only about 82, but he\u2019s still asking questions with his accuracy. An update from England on Archer: it is cramp, and he\u2019s receiving treatment. \u201cThe problem with removing the captaincy from Root,\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cis that the most wanted replacement, Morgan, is not fully fit for the longer game and may or may not continue with the shorter form next year. Who is the best county captain qualified as English enough?\u201d Good question. 49th over: Australia 153-4 (Labuschagne 41, Wade 29) Stokes is still on, which perhaps suggests that Broad is carrying a niggle. He\u2019s getting some late swing, but finally conceding runs now \u2013 a pull for two, a glance for four as Woakes misfields at fine leg. \u201cJust cheered myself up,\u201d says Guy Hornsby, \u201cby wondering what this Test would\u2019ve looked like without Jofra on the scene. The mind boggles. There\u2019s always a lower point than the one you\u2019re at with England!\u201d That\u2019s true. At least it\u2019s not Brexit. 48th over: Australia 147-4 (Labuschagne 41, Wade 23) Woakes appeals for caught behind off Labuschagne, who again probably got his hip in the way, not his bat. When a full toss comes along, Labuschagne \u2013 who got out to one in the first innings \u2013 drives it for four, and that\u2019s the fifty partnership. It feels like the final nail in England\u2019s coffin. Is this, as Rob Smyth was saying during the Warner-Labuschagne mayhem yesterday, the end of days for Joe Root\u2019s captaincy? 47th over: Australia 143-4 (Labuschagne 37, Wade 23) Stokes summons enough fire to strike Wade in the midriff (not a euphemism). He\u2019s part of the way to atonement with admirable figures of 10.2-4-17-1. \u201cAs a neutral,\u201d says Sandile Xaso, \u201cthis game hasn\u2019t been great. What is going on with Test batting? Every single batsman outside the venerable Labuschagne should be forced to watch a million hours of Kane Williamson. Even if they don\u2019t have his talent, they can at least learn from his technique. Play the ball late, under the eyes, with the bat as close to the body as possible.\u201d 46th over: Australia 142-4 (Labuschagne 37, Wade 23) Woakes gets one past the bat too. England have been better since Leach came off, but WinViz is giving Australia an 88% chance of the victory that will retain the Ashes. \u201cHow crucial does that atrocious 70-run spell conceded in 10 overs yesterday look for England now?\u201d asks Tom Dempster. \u201cAustralia were probably well above par with their score yesterday, given the conditions; England well below today. But 70 runs in the context of this game is absolutely huge. Not saying England would be in the driving seat, but the game (and the urn) is effectively gone now. Would have had a sniff without that terrible spell after tea yesterday.\u201d Very true. 45th over: Australia 140-4 (Labuschagne 36, Wade 22) Stokes, straight back on because of Archer\u2019s bout of cramp, is still giving his all. He finishes the over by getting Wade to swish at thin air outside off. Labuschagne looks guilty, there seems to be a nick off the toe-end, but HawkEye shows... a no-ball. 44th over: Australia 138-4 (Labuschagne 35, Wade 22) Woakes keeps Labuschagne honest with a couple of LBW shouts, one just wide of off stump, the other just wide of leg. Jon B is not happy with me. \u201cYour reply to Crossy [42nd over] doesn\u2019t make sense... \u2018but Denly only survived for a while today because he kept not quite nicking it\u2019. Perfect. If only he could have done it for longer. I wish we had more who could do this, tiring the Aussie bowlers and taking shine off the ball. Like Australia seem to be doing (Archer now got cramp?). It comes to something when you criticise (somewhat repeatedly in the OBO) our top scorer!\u201d He may have got the top score, narrowly, but it was the scratchiest of innings. Mid-43rd over: Australia 133-4 (Labuschagne 32, Wade 22) Archer comes back on, delivers a few gentle dots \u2013 and goes off, limping, with what appears to be cramp. He and a few of his team-mates are smiling broadly, which suggests it\u2019s nothing serious. \u201cFans should not be too harsh on England for their Test performances,\u201d says Shankar Mony. \u201cThe ECB set out to prioritise the white ball team, and they stuck to their word with a vengeance, pushing the County Championship to the margins. Surprise, surprise - not playing proper first-class cricket will affect the Test team. The team is not the problem, they are the product of a broken system. And with the plans for next year, the light at the end of the tunnel is the razzmatazz of the Hundred. England get such good crowds for Tests and these crowds are given such rubbish. It hurts me to watch Stokes bust his gut as he always done. All for nothing, I fear.\u201d 42nd over: Australia 133-4 (Labuschagne 32, Wade 22) Leach comes off and rightly so as, unlike at Lord\u2019s, he didn\u2019t manage a single maiden. But the change bears no fruit as Woakes serves up a gentle half-volley and gets smacked for four by the immovable Labuschagne. That\u2019s drinks, with Australia laughing all the way to the urn. \u201cContemplating a fightback (the impossible dream), and picking up on comments earlier,\u201d says Jason Cross, \u201cshould Root promote Denly to 2 and drop Roy to 4? Denly has shown he can survive \u2013 even if he\u2019s not making big runs, he\u2019s doing the opener\u2019s job of knocking the shine off the ball. Root can come in after an hour or so, and the opening bowlers have lost some of their vim and vigour, allowing him to settle and score\u2026 and (hopefully), by the time Roy sees the crease, the match situation allows him to express himself and perhaps accumulate some runs and confidence? And maybe England get a decent total \u2013 even if the run chase is beyond them?\u201d I salute your optimism. Yes, Roy would make more sense at 4 \u2013 Pope even more so, now \u2013 but Denly only survived for a while today because he kept not quite nicking it. 41st over: Australia 128-4 (Labuschagne 27, Wade 22) Labuschagne clips Stokes for two. According to Sky, Stokes\u2019 average speed today has been 87mph, making it his fastest spell in a home Test since 2015. And faster than Archer today (average 86mph). Stokes is busting a gut to atone for the rubbish he dished up yesterday and the near-wide he nicked this morning. 40th over: Australia 124-4 (Labuschagne 25, Wade 22) Leach drops short, so Wade pulls him for four, then goes fuller and gets slog-swept for four more. Ten from the over, and Australia lead by 236. Come on Joe, do something. 39th over: Australia 114-4 (Labuschagne 24, Wade 13) \u201cButt not bat,\u201d says Nasser Hussain. \u201cThere are other words for that,\u201d says Isa Guha, with sudden primness for a promising young commentator. Meanwhile, Stokes jags one past Labuschagne\u2019s outside edge. It flicked the thigh. The gods just don\u2019t want England to regain the Ashes. Given, caught down the leg side, but reviewed instantly, and confidently, Not given, and England are not sure, but they go for it anyway. And it\u2019s umpire\u2019s call, so Wade escapes. 37th over: Australia 111-4 (Labuschagne 23, Wade 11) Stokes tries some bouncers at Wade, who mixes a couple of good sways with an ungainly jerk of the head. Root needs to make about six things happen here: it can\u2019t be long before Jofra has more than a watermelon in his hands. 36th over: Australia 111-4 (Labuschagne 23, Wade 11) A couple of singles off Leach, who\u2019s been fine but nothing special since that explosive first ball. The only excitement in this over comes when a steward confiscates a giant inflatable watermelon, only for Jofra Archer to nick it off him and return it to the crowd, who chant \u201cArise Sir Jofra\u201d. 35th over: Australia 109-4 (Labuschagne 22, Wade 10) Stokes\u2019s radar wobbles and Wade, who\u2019s trying to blast his way out of his bad patch, on-drives him for four. This is the kind of game in which 10 is a pretty good score. Before the wicket, Gary Naylor was on Twitter, saying this: \u201cWill Paine declare tonight and have a little dart?\u201d I assume that\u2019s a joke. 34th over: Australia 104-4 (Labuschagne 21, Wade 6) Leach lets Labuschagne have a single so he can have a go at Wade, but with just a slip and a short leg, Root isn\u2019t entirely backing him up. Wade sweeps, powerfully, and gets four rather than one as Denly misfields on the boundary; then he laps, gets a top-edge, and picks up a streaky two as the ball loops over Bairstow\u2019s head. 33rd over: Australia 97-4 (Labuschagne 20, Wade 0) Success for Stokes, who has bowled infinitely better this afternoon than he did yesterday. He beats Wade outside off and keeps him on a pair. Wade\u2019s Test scores in the past year make interesting reading: 5, 4, 8, 1, 110, 6, 1, 0 and now 0*. Out of nowhere, Stokes produces a yorker, which thuds into Head\u2019s stumps. Can England conjure another collapse here? 32nd over: Australia 97-3 (Labuschagne 20, Head 25) Frustrated by all these dots, Labuschagne goes down the track to Leach and clumps him over mid-on. It\u2019s not off the middle but solid enough to go for four. 31st over: Australia 92-3 (Labuschagne 16, Head 24) Labuschagne is having a struggle here, scoring at less than a run every three balls. \u201cOh no!\u201d he yells as he leaves a ball from Stokes and suddenly sees it swinging in, but it\u2019s not doing enough to rattle the timber. 30th over: Australia 88-3 (Labuschagne 14, Head 23) Leach thinks he\u2019s got Labuschagne LBW, but he\u2019s well down the pitch and England run out of time before they can agree on whether to review. It never rains. But here\u2019s a lovely email from Harry Shannon. \u201cI have lived in Canada for over 40 years, and don\u2019t keep up with cricket (though I still have my copy of Peter May\u2019s Book of Cricket) and haven\u2019t watched it unless I\u2019m back in the UK. So I am well aware of my ignorance. Still ... I\u2019m puzzled that when I do see the scores in 50-over cricket, they seem to often be higher than scores in Test matches. Yet in Tests batsmen don\u2019t have to take risks, so you\u2019d expect they\u2019d be able to build much higher scores. What am I missing?\u201d The white balls, which don\u2019t do much, whereas the Dukes, used in England, go round corners. But you\u2019re right \u2013 it\u2019s still bizarre how England keep racking more runs in 50 overs than when they\u2019ve got all the time in the world. 29th over: Australia 88-3 (Labuschagne 14, Head 22) Stokes has been much better in this spell, but thanks to that strange slow-motion cock-up, he has nothing to show for it. A lifter, a straightforward nick... a fumble, another chance \u2013 and another fumble, off balance. Poor old Root. 28th over: Australia 87-3 (Labuschagne 14, Head 21) A couple of singles off Leach. \u201cOi oi,\u201d says Laurent Baldoni. \u201cFollowing up on yesterday\u2019s question - and giddy with excitement at the thought of being \u2018published\u2019 two days running - can the extra overs given to the next days following lengthy rain delays be taken off again if it\u2019s a ridiculously low-scoring game? Given our rather alarming knack of being skittled out for nothing, I\u2019d wager a few people would love to see matches drag into a 4th day rather than play extra overs today and tomorrow.\u201d It\u2019s a good point. If England carry on being this bad, all sorts of cricketing conventions may have to be overturned. 27th over: Australia 85-3 (Labuschagne 13, Head 20) Root turns to Stokes, which is brave after yesterday afternoon, and is rewarded with a maiden to Head, who cops one somewhere near the box. \u201cExcellent coverage as always!\u201d Thank you, Ray Chiverton. \u201cWhat do the experts think will be an impossible target for England on this pitch and would they expect Australia to achieve the necessary total this innings? (Please don\u2019t say 68!)\u201c Not sure I count as an expert, but ... Headingley is quite a wacky venue, feast then famine. In theory, on a third-day pitch, England should be able to chase 280. But there\u2019s a mysterious gravity that drags teams down in the fourth innings of a Test, and England more than most. Somebody\u2019s going to have to play Shai Hope, and it\u2019s probably got to be Root himself, bouncing back after consecutive ducks. 26th over: Australia 85-3 (Labuschagne 13, Head 20) Head is hesitant at first, as if his mind is still on the Victoria sponge, but he squeezes Leach away for three. England have no problems here that can\u2019t be fixed by a double hat-trick from Archer. 25th over: Australia 82-3 (Labuschagne 13, Head 17) Archer was just changing ends, reverting to the Kirkstall Lane end, where he took that six-for, all those hours ago. It\u2019s uphill, but he\u2019s used to that from Hove. His speed is down again, mid-80s, yet he still draws an edge from Head, well half-stopped by Stokes at third slip, and a play-and-miss from Labuschagne. And that\u2019s tea, with Australia, after a wobble, leading by 194 and waltzing towards the Ashes. 24th over: Australia 81-3 (Labuschagne 13, Head 16) Root, who\u2019s been more proactive in this innings, takes Archer off (7-2-15-0) and sends for Leach. These two played him well at Lord\u2019s, when the heat was on, and they play him well here, picking off the singles. 23rd over: Australia 77-3 (Labuschagne 11, Head 14) Another of those half-volleys from Broad, who may well be knackered. Head waits till it\u2019s under his nose and square-drives for four. \u201cOn this wicket,\u201d says Yum, \u201cI\u2019m sure James Vince would get a very stylish 3.\u201d 22nd over: Australia 73-3 (Labuschagne 11, Head 10) Archer goes round the wicket to Labuschagne and rather loses his way, bowling short outside leg, when his field is still set for line\u2019n\u2019length. Labuschagne calmly glances him for four. \u201cIn moments of despair like this,\u201d says Adam Horridge, \u201cit\u2019s natural to look for any small positives. My current coping mechanism has been to pronounce Labuschagne in line with \u2018Lasagne\u2019. It may not solve our current predicament entirely but it\u2019s helping. Marginal gains etc.\u201d 21st over: Australia 67-3 (Labuschagne 7, Head 10) Just when England had the plug in, Broad gives Head a half-volley, which is eased away for four. Here\u2019s Tor Turner. \u201cThe most surprising statistic I have at the moment is that CricViz are still giving (at the time of writing) England a 22% chance of victory. I\u2019d rate it far, far lower.\u201d With you there, Tor. \u201cIn other news, I have tickets for Day 4 of this Test. The weather looks like it\u2019s going to be excellent, but I\u2019m also pretty sure the match is going to be over by then. My first ever chance to go to a men\u2019s international test match, too.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t write it off just yet. 20th over: Australia 61-3 (Labuschagne 6, Head 5) Archer is keeping the batsmen honest, but he\u2019s not making things happen \u2013 yet. Labuschagne seems to have done something to irritate him, and by the end of the over the speed gun is up at 92, then 93. \u201cJames Vince,\u201d says Peter Rowntree, picking up on my parallel between Vince and Khawaja (14th over). \u201cVinny got 69 yesterday, playing in a T20 game for Hants \u2013 that\u2019s more than the whole England team put together. Not advocating his return, but just saying...\u201d 19th over: Australia 60-3 (Labuschagne 6, Head 4) Broad lures Labuschagne into a play-and-miss as he gropes outside off. The next ball, also outside off, is a great big wide. Christopher Davis is having some fun with today\u2019s stats. \u201cAt 52-3, if you take out the partnership of 111 between Warner and Labuschagne, 22 wickets have fallen for 187 runs, at an average of 8.5.\u201d Yes, the outlier was not the England innings, dismal though it was. The outlier was that hour after tea yesterday when Woakes and Stokes went for six an over. Stokes, after saving the game at Lord\u2019s on Sunday, has done more than anyone to lose this one. He\u2019s a phenomenal cricketer, but not a baffling choice as vice-captain. 18th over: Australia 59-3 (Labuschagne 6, Head 4) Another single for Labuschagne, off Archer. England have to make things happen all the time now, so Root is summoning Broad. 17th over: Australia 58-3 (Labuschagne 5, Head 4) Labuschagne, who seems to have been born a senior player, works Woakes to leg for a single, and Travis Head gets off the dreaded pair with a firm clunk down the ground for four. Australia lead by 170, which may well be enough already. \u201cIf England should somehow manage to limit the run chase to around 200,\u201d asks Brendan Large, \u201cwould anyone in their right mind give England a chance of reaching it?\u201d 16th over: Australia 53-3 (Labuschagne 4, Head 0) Archer starts with something that is either a rank loosener or a lateral thought \u2013 a slower ball, 79mph, but it\u2019s outside Labuschagne\u2019s leg stump. A straighter ball brings an LBW appeal as Labuschagne shuffles across, but it\u2019s missing the leg bail. This game is hurtling along. After eight days as a Test cricketer, Archer may be yearning for the tranquillity of Twenty20. 15th over: Australia 52-3 (Labuschagne 4, Head 0) A wicket maiden for Woakes, beginning to redeem himself after that strangely terrible spell after tea yesterday. And heeeeere comes Jofra... Khawaja wafts at Woakes and hands a simple catch to Roy at second slip. Straight from the school of Vince. 14th over: Australia 52-2 (Khawaja 23, Labuschagne 4) Khawaja is an odd player, a stylist and a dud at the same time, like James Vince. He cover-drives Leach handsomely and even has the chutzpah to reverse-sweep (cleanly, but for no run). And then he plays and misses again. 13th over: Australia 47-2 (Khawaja 18, Labuschagne 4) Woakes is warming up now, pitching the ball up and making it talk. He gets Khawaja edging, short of the slips, then missing as he plays outside the one that swings back in, and then edging again. This game is just one damn edge after another. 12th over: Australia 40-2 (Khawaja 11, Labuschagne 4) So Leach\u2019s first ball takes a wicket, and his second goes for four as Marnus Labuschagne plays a gorgeous inside-out drive through the covers. If this was a school match \u2013 and the scores strongly suggest that it is \u2013 Labuschagne would be told to change sides to make a game of it. Root turns to spin, and spin does the trick! Jack Leach\u2019s first ball lands in the rough, sneaks through the gate and snuffs out a promising effort from Harris. 11th over: Australia 36-1 (Harris 19, Khawaja 11) Woakes produces one jaffa, but Harris manages not to nick it. Khawaja, by the way, has become the second top-three batsman on either side to reach 100 runs for the series, which wouldn\u2019t usually be worth writing home about. Root is on 99, from five innings; Warner 79 from six. Only Burns, with 235 from five, has coped. 10th over: Australia 35-1 (Harris 18, Khawaja 11) The Australians are looking to attack, which is wise \u2013 they could snuff out England\u2019s rather faint chances by the end of today. Harris sees a full wide one from Broad and slaps it for four, not far from backward point. 9th over: Australia 30-1 (Harris 13, Khawaja 11) Khawaja hooks Woakes, in the air, raising English hopes for a second, but it\u2019s finer than fine leg and goes for a one-bounce four. Woakes retorts by beating the bat with some outswing to the left-hander. Australia already have a lead of 142: Ashes to Ashes. 8th over: Australia 26-1 (Harris 13, Khawaja 7) A maiden but no joy for Broad. He\u2019s bowled very well in both innings, whereas Woakes and Stokes, after that horror show yesterday, are in the doghouse. But it\u2019s missing, doing too much. That review was like England\u2019s day so far: bafflingly bad. 7th over: Australia 26-1 (Harris 13, Khawaja 7) Woakes replaces Archer, who hasn\u2019t been quite right today. No surprise. There are exclamations as Harris edges through the cordon, but Harris was hanging back and playing that with some control. Ok. I am also cooked after that frantic start to the day: \u201cthese first few desperate hours,\u201d as the Mountain Goats would have it. I\u2019m out, and Tim de Lisle is in. Kindly address your missives of triumph and despair to him from now on. 6th over: Australia 22-1 (Harris 10, Khawaja 6) Lovely from Khawaja, controlled square drive as he reaches for Broad\u2019s overpitched ball and sends it to the fence. He picks up another single thereafter. 5th over: Australia 17-1 (Harris 10, Khawaja 1) Archer is bowling fast, but keeps losing it down the leg side. Khawaja ducks and evades. Bairstow lets a bye escape. Hard work keeping to this. Archer finally gets one right and is unplayable for one ball on off stump. 4th over: Australia 16-1 (Harris 10, Khawaja 1) Broad bowls full and Harris drives him down the ground for four, but the bowler soon hits back with a searching length that nearly takes the edge. He needs to produce another miracle for England, they need a Cape Town 2012 kind of third innings here. Khawaja off the mark with a glance. As you might imagine, I\u2019m being flooded with despondent emails at the moment, so forgive a relative lack of engagement on that front. The volume is at Spinal Tap levels. 3rd over: Australia 11-1 (Harris 6, Khawaja 0) Archer must be absolutely cooked. Bowls a massive wide, then gets his line back on the stumps. 2nd over: Australia 10-1 (Harris 6, Khawaja 0) Broad angles the ball into the left-handed Khawaja for most of the over, who misses a couple into his pads and down the leg side. Not exactly the most threatening line though, yet. The collapso carries on! After four leg byes from Warner\u2019s pad to fine leg, Broad angles a ball in and beats the inside edge. And I\u2019m sorry to say that\u2019s another poor display from umpire Joel Wilson. He was thinking the ball hit Warner outside the line I suspect, and didn\u2019t give it. Then after Broad really shouted and went down on a knee and waved his arms, the umpire very belatedly popped his finger up. That\u2019s not a display of confidence. Warner reviews, and the replay says... umpire\u2019s call for impact on the pad, and hitting leg stump. 1st over: Australia 6-0 (Harris 6, Warner 0) So after bowling Australia out yesterday, Archer is back bowling by this afternoon. Harris gets another chance after being thrown under the bus. He drives Archer through cover for four, then a brace. Happy days. Here\u2019s Tim with the revised total. Help us, Jeebus. Yes. Please. It\u2019s hard to compute the scale of this disaster. All of that talk about England having the momentum and the best of Lord\u2019s... I thought that was basically junk at the time, and did write in that vein. Test matches are really hard to win, and if you don\u2019t take your chance when one arises, you can\u2019t expect the next one to present itself. Where to from here? Trevor Bayliss is already halfway out the door, and if ever a performance had the faint tang of airline food, this was it. Root as captain can\u2019t make runs and can\u2019t get his troops going. Smith demolished him in terms of leading from the front in Australia in 2017-18, and is still doing so despite not playing in this match. \u201cJust curious as to why Eoin Morgan isn\u2019t playing in the Ashes?\u201d was the question from Irish watcher Colm earlier in the day. Largely because he doesn\u2019t have a great red-ball playing history and he\u2019s not too good against short fast bowling. But he couldn\u2019t be any worse than this lot, and he might inject some spine. I have been floating this idea for a little while, as the following will attest... This seemed bad when Tim sent it an hour ago but the updated version would be horrendous. Show\u2019s over! Go home! The Ashes have surely been scattered to the winds. Funereal. But not for Hazlewood, who has five wickets and is absolutely mobbed by his teammates. A huge hug pile. He walks off the field holding the ball aloft. Leach was drifting across his stumps looking to play to leg. He missed and was bowled leg stump. England have been bowled out for 67! Sixty-seven all out. On a sunny afternoon on home soil, giving Australia a lead of 112, and surely conceding the trophy when this match is eventually lost. This is a true debacle, and one that will reverberate for a long time to come. 27th over: England 67-9 (Broad 4, Leach 1) Jack Leach comes in, from opener to jack. Two balls to survive from Cummins. Both at the body. Both gloved past short leg. One gets him a run. Unpleasant. Oh my Lawwwwwd. What is this crapshoot? Jofra, what are you doing? He looks wonderful. He smokes Cummins with a pull shot through midwicket. Climbs into the short ball. But then he ducks to leave, but leaves the periscope up. The bat in the backlift. And the ball takes a little touch. Archer reviews in the hope of a no-ball but walks off straight away. He was copying Smith\u2019s style in the nets, and now he\u2019s copying it in the middle. 26th over: England 60-8 (Archer 1, Broad 4) Well, Broad created the 60 at Trent Bridge and he gets England to 60 here. Hazlewood bowls a couple of nasty short ones, but the last ball of the over is glanced through fine leg for four. \u201cNot surprisingly, the Guardian scoreboard is struggling to keep up,\u201d writes Graham Moger. \u201cThree wickets behind at the moment - significantly better than England\u2019s current score.\u201d Another one! Buttler, the last prayer for something special, falls on deaf ears. A cold and indifferent universe rather than an attentive deity. Hazlewood has a short cover in for exactly this purpose. Bowls full, Buttler drives, the hard low catch is held. There are 72 overs left in the day, and England haven\u2019t yet passed Australia\u2019s 60 from Trent Bridge four years ago. 25th over: England 56-7 (Buttler 5, Archer 1) A lot of people have been emailing about Jofra\u2019s match-saving hundred. Now is his chance. He ducks a few bouncers from Cummins, predictably. Then plays a lovely strange light-sabre pull shot tucked off his hip with a flat blade for one. FIRST BALL AFTER LUNCH! The England Test team is broken! This is disaster being played out live! They bowled superbly, they had this match on a plate, but they\u2019ve decided to play Greek weddings instead. A post-prandial loosener, Cummins bowls short down the leg side, Woakes plays at it with no real hope of doing much, at around ribcage height, and he can only glove it to Paine. There\u2019s a long replay of the front foot, but a micron of heel is behind the line when the foot first makes contact with the ground, even though it later slips forward. \u201cAs if my day couldn\u2019t get any worse,\u201d writes Damian Burns. \u201cCurrently stuck in Johannesburg airport on an 8 hour layover watching the Aussies completely tuck us up. And just as I thought my day couldn\u2019t get any worse I\u2019ve had a promotional email from none other than Eoin Morgan: \u2018And there\u2019s a new cricket competition coming, The Hundred, starting in July 2020. I think the quality of cricket will be superb, because it\u2019ll be intense with just 100 balls per side. It\u2019ll be really easy for kids to follow and get into it...\u2019 Yuck, Eoin. Yuck.\u201d Brian Murphy emails in. \u201cThis riveting second day is providing the perfect excuse for my still being in my pyjamas at half one in the afternoon (I work from home, I swear...)\u201d I\u2019d be doing the same if I wasn\u2019t in a press box. In fact I used to have a job with a uniform that was laundered and provided at work, and I did often show up to work in my pyjamas in those days. \u201cSo I don\u2019t really know or understand too much about the tactics and psychology of the batting order. I\u2019ve never really played cricket properly, bar a bit in a school and some back garden wonder series, and am wondering could you do a post about same? Or perhaps solicit input from more knowledgeable folk? Why is Roy not performing better? Confidence, or lack of skills? What is one looking for in an opener as opposed to a five or six? I guess I have a rather simplistic understanding of the game. Thanks in advance if you can shed some light for the less clued-in cricket fans amongst us.\u201d If the proper badgers will forgive a quick recap, then sure thing. Basically opening the batting is the hardest job, because the bowlers are fresh and the ball is new. This means that it is more likely to swing, because the lacquer is still on the ball. It is more likely to move off the seam, because the seam is new and hard. And it\u2019s more likely to bounce higher, because the ball is hard. As the ball gets softer, it usually does less for the bowler. So an opener\u2019s main job is to survive, but some openers can be counter-attacking and throw the bowlers into disarray by scoring quickly against the new ball. Batsmen at around four and five are supposed to be the long innings players who you build around, then six and seven can either save a tough situation, or attack from a strong position, and can bat with the tailenders effectively. Roy plays a high-risk style of game, which makes some low scores inevitable. Here\u2019s some equally dispiriting news for England supporters, and cricket enthusiasts. This kid still has a Test average of 43 and was supposed to be England\u2019s next ten-year player. Australia have stormed into the match this morning. Their score of 179 might have looked light, but it was always a chance to be competitive if they bowled as well as England did yesterday. Hazlewood did, and was almost enough on his own. Cummins added some hurry-up late, then Pattinson preyed on the indecision. There were some good balls and some unnecessary shots. England are in massive trouble, trailing by 125, and it\u2019ll take a minor miracle to get them to parity. 24th over: England 54-6 (Buttler 4, Woakes 5) With one over till lunch, Hazlewood summons one more effort of will. He nearly gets the seventh wicket several times: Woakes fending and missing, Woakes nearly stabbing to short leg but getting a run, Buttler edging on the bounce to slip. The batsmen survive though, and that will be lunch. 23rd over: England 53-6 (Buttler 4, Woakes 4) Pattinson bowls too full, and this time he doesn\u2019t take a wicket. Buttler crashes him through cover for four! And around the crowd comes a glorious Bronx, laden with irony, because England\u2019s 50 has come up. Pattinson bowls a good bouncer, ducked, then a ball that swerves in the air, coming in and over the stumps as Buttler leaves. \u201cWhat a curious and amazing sport this is: the series will be played over 20 days / 120 hours or more (to the bafflement of so many other sports fans) but the whole competition is decided in one short session, on a fine sunny morning in Yorkshire.\u201d Or the next session, Will West, when this pair pile on 120 on the way to a decisive lead. 22nd over: England 49-6 (Buttler 0, Woakes 4) England would not have wanted to be down to Buttler and Woakes. There are far worse pairs to be doing a rescue job, but this is on the brink of disaster. Woakes gets beaten outside off, then nearly pops up a leading edge off his pads. Hazlewood attacks the stumps again, defended scrappily, and again, clipped nicely for four. Woakes has been in fine form down the order with the bat in this series. He needs a fifth Test fifty today. Oh, Jonny, what have you done? Back to Waterstones, my friend. That wasn\u2019t Hazlewood\u2019s best ball of the day. It was decent, line and length, doing a bit. But Bairstow is rooted to the crease and prods outside the line, unnecessary, and Warner gobbles up his one millionth catch at first slip. 21st over: England 45-5 (Bairstow 4, Buttler 0) Pattinson finishes a wicket maiden. My colleague Rory Dollard of the Press Association has just read out this handy summary of Denly\u2019s day. outside edge lbw given out, overturned play and miss lbw shout not out play and miss play and miss play and miss off the mark chopped past stumps play and miss chopped past stumps play and miss play and miss out Talk about timing. Denly has faced nearly 50 balls, but finally his stay ends. Width from Pattinson, a big drive, a big edge, and a catch behind. 20th over: England 45-4 (Denly 12, Bairstow 4) Hazlewood bowls his ninth. Bairstow gets off the mark gliding a four. \u201cHi Geoff, can\u2019t the relevant cricket authorities devise a new Test format that is only played between Archer and Smith, because it appears everyone else is pretty crap at cricket.\u201d I\u2019d pay to see that, Mark Shanes. Mind you, I\u2019d also pay to see the brilliant bowling the last two days from Broad, Woakes, Cummins and Hazlewood. And I don\u2019t even have to, I\u2019m at work. But let\u2019s not lose sight of the quality of the bowling when the batting is bad. 19th over: England 40-4 (Denly 11, Bairstow 0) Pattinson gets a full over to bowl at Bairstow, but YJB is thinking about a book-signing in Leeds because he plays everything very straight. Twenty minutes till lunch, so it\u2019s really just a matter of getting through now and taking a collective deep breath. 18th over: England 40-4 (Denly 11, Bairstow 0) Hazlewood will want to bowl forever. He saws Denly in half again, a ball that cuts back and bounces savagely while the batsman prods and the slips appeal. No edge. Then Denly turns from magician\u2019s assistant to drunken Cossack dancer, shambling across the crease in a cloud of limbs to try defending another ball that cranks off the seam past his outside edge once more. The batsman ends the over by slicing two more runs through gully. Talk about hard-earned. \u201cI\u2019ve found that the best strategy for collecting autographs later in life is to have the company of a small child, on whom one can project any star-struck giddiness one might be experiencing,\u201d advises Timothy Sanders. \u201cMy son was selected as mascot for the Roses T20 at Headingley, in 2014 when he was nine years old. It rained dismally all evening, and as a consolation we were brought in to meet the players. My son got photos and signatures from Jonny Bairstow, Aaron Finch, Ryan Sidebottom and all, and I have a mild sense of embarrassment about how excitable I was. The picture of Jonny B with my son and daughter is especially lovely, and the sequel is that I printed it out and got him to sign it along with his book at Waterstones in Leeds a few years later.\u201d 17th over: England 38-4 (Denly 9, Bairstow 0) Pattinson down the hill. A giant brick of a bowler, tattooed arms, broad hips, powerful through the crease. A broad white sweatband on his left forearm. Thunders a ball into Bairstow\u2019s pad for a leg bye, flirting with 90 miles an hour. Two men out for the hook in case he wants to bounce, but they only come into play when he bowls full on the pads and Denly whips very cleanly to deep square. 16th over: England 36-4 (Denly 8, Bairstow 0) Hazlewood into his seventh over, and again he\u2019s beating Denly\u2019s edge. There\u2019s plenty out there for the bowlers, sunshine or no. Hazlewood will need a break soon though. Denly scores a couple of runs to fine leg. 15th over: England 34-4 (Denly 6, Bairstow 0) This is fast becoming a debacle. Bairstow will bat at six, Buttler at seven. The two keepers and Denly have to create something to try to get England a lead. They\u2019re a long way from 179 at the moment. Would it be more calming for some readers to go back to some stories? \u201cAt Jack Simmons\u2019 benefit match at Blackpool (1980 if memory serves) I snared Joel Garner and Alvin Kallicharran among other signatures,\u201d writes David Seare. \u201cWaiting patiently for Michael \u2018whispering death\u2019 Holding, I was crushed that the great man told me he was busy fielding. Felled by a short one at the tender age of 13. I\u2019ve forgiven him now...but the scars run deep.\u201d I think he\u2019s upstairs in the TV box, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019ll run it by him if I see him. Stokes is gone! You can\u2019t keep Warner out of the game. James Pattinson in his first over. He bowls too wide and Stokes fires it away through point just by deflecting the ball away. But when Stokes tries to repeat the dose to a similar ball, he just gets a fat top edge and Warner takes the catch over his shoulder. That was almost beyond the return crease when Stokes caught up with it. 14th over: England 30-3 (Denly 6, Stokes 4) Nothing looks easy out there. Denly nearly edges Hazlewood to the cordon, then jabs a single away to the leg side. 13th over: England 28-3 (Denly 5, Stokes 3) With Stokes around the runs come a bit more freely. A couple through cover, a fairly workmanlike pull shot whacked away to deep midwicket for one. Denly, loose, nearly edges one, plays a weird cross-bat helicopter-rotor sort of half leave and ends up playing the ball past his leg stump. Cummins must be at the end of his spell by now. Country cricket talking points for those who are keen. 12th over: England 24-3 (Denly 4, Stokes 0) Interesting: Lyon must have been purely a tactic against the left-handed Burns. Now that Burns is gone, Hazlewood is straight back on. Getting some swing now, past the outside edge once again. He throws up the tempter, and Denly finally gets off the mark from his 24th ball, driving it very nicely out through cover for four. Covered the line well with a good stride. Hazlewood won\u2019t mind too much though. Drive away, my friend. That\u2019s drinks! (That are drinks?) 11th over: England 20-3 (Denly 0, Stokes 0) A certain Ben Stokes has been the day-saver for England all summer. Now he has to do it again. A couple of dots and Cummins completes a wicket maiden. Nasty from Cummins! Gets his man after working him over. The sequence starts bouncer that almost hits Burns in the grille. He\u2019s jumping and twisting. Gets his gloves up in front of his face and the ball hits his chest and goes earthbound quickly enough to prevent the short leg swooping in. That\u2019ll get the heart racing. He blocks once, then tries a square drive to a fuller ball but is only half-forward, and mistimes it to point. He\u2019s in two minds now. So Cummins goes short again, just off line towards the batsman\u2019s right shoulder, and Burns tries to hook but is done for pace and can only glove it down leg side! The fourth ball dismissed him but the first ball was the wicket-taker. 10th over: England 20-2 (Burns 9, Denly 0) Nathan Lyon on for a trundle. He likes bowling with a newish ball, but this is an interesting call. I suppose James Pattinson will be on for Cummins down the hill soon, but I wouldn\u2019t be taking Cummins off yet. A slip and a bat-pad on the off side for Burns, while the latter becomes a short leg for the right-handed Denly. They manage a couple of singles and a leg bye. Burns gets the runs, Denly the extra. Still on nought. \u201cJust a single autograph in my box of keepsakes,\u201d writes Cogs. \u201cCharlie Nicholas scrawled on the back of a beer mat from the Tuxedo Princess, a floating night club that was moored under the Tyne bridge for much of the 80s. He appeared with two blonde ladies and one bottle of champagne following a 0-0 draw at Roker Park. God knows how he celebrated after a good game...\u201d 9th over: England 17-2 (Burns 7, Denly 0) Preferring to bowl the right-handed Denly, by the looks, Cummins is seaming the ball a mile. Coming down the hill with the sun on his shoulders, one comes in and isn\u2019t too far from off stump, another hits the pad without Denly offering a shot and is pretty close to lbw, a third cuts the batsman in half and is taken by Paine a couple of metres down the leg side, and a fourth does the same from a fuller length, through the gate, and somehow misses off stump by a whisker. Denly might as well be taking guard at square leg for all the part that he played in that over. 8th over: England 17-2 (Burns 7, Denly 0) The workout continues. Another JH ball past the outside edge, another two into the pads. Denly finally gets to run for cover when a leg bye deflects. The TV broadcast showed Hazlewood\u2019s full roasting of Roy: a dozen balls that angled in, seamed in, cramped him. A couple of wider ones once in a while to draw a shot. One miss, one four, one nick, from the widest ball of the day. Couldn\u2019t help himself. Burns is nearly lbw to a scrambled-seamer from Hazlewood but manages a small nick. With the angle to the left-hander, he\u2019s able to stab a brace off his pads next ball. 7th over: England 14-2 (Burns 5, Denly 0) Burns has just been watching from the other end as the chaos unfolds. It\u2019s not often that Cummins isn\u2019t the bowler you most want to watch, or the one you most want to face, but that\u2019s the case this morning as he bowls on the pads and Burns clips it for his first boundary. Cummins hits back with a couple of lovely deliveries that seam and beat the left-hander, no idea what to do there. But the over ends and it\u2019s time for Hazlewood again... 6th over: England 10-2 (Burns 1, Denly 0) Well, Root wanted Denly to open, and has kindly volunteered to make that effectively the reality. It\u2019s the sixth over, two England batsmen have gone and another was spared by an inch. Hazlewood who missed the first match has done the early damage as he did at Lord\u2019s. He has 2 for 4 from three overs. Perfect seaming delivery from Hazlewood. Pace, a vicious angle, it burned past the attempted defensive shot and into his back pad in front of middle. I would have given it every day of the week. HawkEye reckons it\u2019s just going over the bails. With Hazlewood\u2019s bounce that\u2019s not totally unreasonable. Denly would have had a four-ball blob. Let\u2019s wait... Another one for Hazlewood! Another for Warner. And another duck for Root, this time second ball rather than first... that is just a bit of movement, and just a bit the wrong line from Root. Again the ball is angling in towards the right-hander\u2019s stumps from a slightly wider line. Root is just trying to defend, but rather than hitting the pads Hazlewood seams it away a touch and takes a serious fast edge. It flies away, and Warner hurls himself to his left and takes the catch facing the grandstand after the effort turns him around. He hurls the ball down and shouts, \u201cWhat about that!\u201d It was a fine catch in scrambled circumstances. 5th over: England 10-1 (Burns 1, Root 0) Cummins sends down another maiden to Burns... Luke Austin has emailed. \u201cAs a young West Ham fan i managed to get Keith Rowland (our left back at the time) to sign his autograph on the match day programme, which at the time was a highlight of my short life. The kudos soon faded as I moved into my teenage years and fell into a less sporty crowd, and rather sadly had me pretending that the autograph was in fact that of Kevin Rowland of Dexy\u2019s Midnight Runners, which was a favourite of the time (Young Soul Rebels era anyway) and someone whose autograph I thought would impress girls far more, no matter how implausible it was that I would have bumped into him at a West Ham game. Sorry Keith.\u201d 4th over: England 10-1 (Burns 1, Root 0) Another early mark for Warnakulasuriya Patabendige Ushantha Joseph Chaminda Root. Sorry, wrong cricketer. That\u2019s what Root thinks, too, because he wants Denly to open. So I suppose that conversation will keep on being had. My two cents: you\u2019ve picked Roy to be aggressive at the top of the order, so at least give him the series without lamenting every low score. If he comes off once, he\u2019ll win you a Test match. I\u2019m not sure old mate Denners would have been piling up the tons if he\u2019d come in first instead of fourth. He\u2019s gone again! This was probably Roy\u2019s best chance of the series so far to make a score. He starts the over well, arching his back to scorch a square drive away for four. But Hazlewood bowls him some serious width, pitched up, and Roy has a booming drive at it, getting a thick edge to Warner at first slip. Hear the critics mass at the gates, chanting a thick dirge in unison... 3rd over: England 6-0 (Burns 1, Roy 5) Cummins tries out the short ball, and nearly gets Burns \u2013 fended away and it lands just in front of short leg. A bouncer follows but Burns plays this pretty well, with his wonky-headed stance, dipping down under the ball to let it through. A maiden. Here\u2019s the TMS overseas link for today. 2nd over: England 6-0 (Burns 1, Roy 5) Josh Hazlewood will have the uphill task with the Emerald Stand at his back. He\u2019s angling the ball into Roy and has a big shout for lbw straight away, but it would have been bouncing high. Hazlewood tries the same again but Roy gets some bat on it this time to defend. Then he plays a big back-foot drive as Hazlewood shifts his line to the west, where Roy predictably meets fresh air. Reassuring start for all those Roy devotees out there. 1st over: England 6-0 (Burns 1, Roy 5) Good morning from Headingley, good morrow to other parts of the world. The sun is out! Stone the crowds and dose up the pigeons. It\u2019s not convincing sunshine yet, it\u2019s filtered through a gauze of cloud, so we\u2019ll see whether the sun burns it off or the cloud gathers its ranks. Either way, it\u2019s a much better day to be batting than yesterday. We\u2019ll see if England can make the most of it. Starting the bowling off will be Patrick Cummins, he of the bandy-legged stride like he\u2019s just hopped off a horse to go for a gallop himself. He starts with a beauty outside Rory Burns\u2019 off stump, no looseners there. But with four in the cordon, Burns is able to drop a single towards cover and get off strike. Roy feels for the ball, soft-handed enough that the outside edge goes down and into the gap for four. Then the right-hander knocks a single to midwicket. Decent start. Ok, that\u2019s enough from me. Jerusalem is reverberating around Headingley which means the opening delivery of the day is nearing and that means time for Geoff Lemon to take the keys. Please redirect your emails to geoff.lemon@theguardian.com and tweets to @GeoffLemonSport. \u201cI can\u2019t say I feel that confident about the England batting line-up, but at least they have already avoided the follow-on,\u201d emails Archie Campbell with some splendid gallows humour. It does feel like a significant hour or two though, doesn\u2019t it? Perfect conditions for England to make a statement and take the series by the scruff of the neck. I like the sound of this a lot. Consecutive emails land in my inbox celebrating the glory days of British track-and-field of the late 80s/early 90s. First, Scott Roberts. \u201cI hope Philip Malcolm\u2019s experience of meeting Dalton Grant was as pleasurable as mine. I was competing for good old Team Solent (Kriss Akabusi and Roger Black\u2019s old team that no longer exists) in the good old British Athletics League back in the 90s. One of our competitions was up in Dumfries, and I remember us arriving typically late after having been rammed into a minibus for hours and not having time for a proper warm-up to try and produce a decent long jump, which I obviously didn\u2019t. However, I had the pleasure of competing against Dalton Grant (obviously better known as a high jumper), who was the most lovely man you could ever meet. He was so friendly that he would be chatting to people as he was running down the runway and then, with his exception ability, still be able to sail out over 7 metres, which I had to absolutely bust my backside to achieve, not very frequently. And he can\u2019t have been any taller than 6\u20191\u201d, which makes him being able to high hump close to 2.40m just mind-boggling.\u201d Then Matthew Eley. \u201cAs a youngster I once managed to pluck up courage to ask Kris Akabusi for his autograph. He was very happy to do so but as he tried to sign my scrap of paper my WWF wrestling pen ran out. No autograph but I did get the trademark laugh so not all bad.\u201d While Mr Archer has stolen all the headlines Andy Bull has made sure Stuart Broad receives praise for his excellent series so far. It is turning into an interesting summer for Broad. At the beginning, it wasn\u2019t even clear whether or not he would play every Test since he was competing, all of a sudden, with a couple of younger and quicker bowlers in Jofra Archer and Olly Stone. But that injury to Jimmy Anderson at Edgbaston has left Broad as the senior member of the team, the old hand of the bowling attack. And he seems to be enjoying himself almost as much as Archer is. Archer had bowled just 10 overs here before, during the match against Sri Lanka in the World Cup, but he still cleaned up six wickets. Thank you for the many many excellent autograph emails you\u2019re flinging my way. I am giggling at, but filtering out, the swearier ones, and those that reflect poorly on people who have no right of reply. Jack Kellam makes the cut. \u201cAs a 9 year-old on a school free ticket to watch a West Indies v South Africa ODI at Sophia Gardens in the early \u201800s, I headed to the loos after one too many cokes, only to look over star-struck at a certain Sir Viv Richards at the urinal adjacent to mine. After what was likely far too long a stare, I then hovered outside the door with one of those Natwest 4/6 cards, which the great man diligently proceeded to autograph at my request. Quite comfortably tops my other childhood autograph experiences, limited to: Welsh rugby star Ieuan Jones in a school sports hall, and Craig Quinell in a scout hut.\u201d I love how that ends like a list of failed Alan Partridge variety show pitches. Stuart Morphet is back with his reverse psychology. It worked yesterday, so why not try again? \u201cGlad my email of yesterday suggesting England should bowl and that we\u2019ve all had enough of experts proved prophetic. Now if we can all just \u2018believe in batting\u2019 everything will be perfect.\u201d There\u2019s plenty to like in this email from Jonathan Wood, which could also double up as a splendid Morecambe and Wise sketch. \u201cAs a nipper, I would go to watch Notts play and at the intervals, all us kids would crowd round the players asking for autographs. This would include the away team, who we didn\u2019t really know from Adam, but would help fill up the autograph book. I once got to the front of a queue, only for the cricketer to take a look at me and said \u201cI\u2019ve already signed your book\u201d. Obviously, I looked to deny it, so he took my book, turned it a few pages, and with a very kind smile on his face, showed me. I\u2019d tell you who it was, but obviously I have no idea.\u201d Geoff Lemon took an Australian angle on yesterday\u2019s play and he questioned the merit of throwing Marcus Harris in at the deep end. Both Bancroft and Harris could have benefited from more time. Five Tests, a full series, the best chance to find a way. By definition only one of them could have had it. Now neither will. England and Australia could equally stand to learn: in the game of openers, patience matters most of all. Richard Smyth has a happier autograph tale to tell. \u201cLast summer I sought to add to my meagre autograph haul (Tony Dorigo and Gary Speed - Wakefield Intersport, early 1990s, The Grumbleweeds (all of them!) - Scarborough seafront, mid-1980s) by collaring D. Gower at the Headingley Test last summer. \u201cI\u2019m too old to be doing this...\u201d I began. \u201cNonsense,\u201d he said, taking my pen and programme and gesturing to the posse of baking autograph fiends along the stand, \u201clook at the state of those bastards.\u201d I treasure the memory to this day (but not the autograph, because I got drunk and left it on my seat).\u201d Regal. Ben Powell has just been to a gig that sounds very good, and pleasingly threads a series of discussions neatly together. \u201cSerendipitously, last Friday I was in Glasgow and saw Mogwai supporting the Cure. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t get autographs from any of them, but I did get very, very muddy.\u201d Not sure Mogwai are an autograph band, are they? Ian Davies finds the back of the net with a scorcher of an email. \u201cTalking of opening acts the first gig I went to was James in Derby, where the warm up act were a band called \u201cRadiohead\u201d. They\u2019d just released a song called Creep and were destined to become novelty one-hit wonders\u2026\u201d Kim Thonger\u2019s logged on. \u201cReading the paper this morning, I see that Peppa Pig has been bought by Hasbro, taking advantage of the weak pound. That, and Trump\u2019s thwarted yearning for Greenland, is making me worry that foreign investors will swoop on our irreplaceable national asset/treasure Sir Jofra Archer, and carry him off to distant lands, never to be seen charging in at the Nursery End again. To prevent this, the government should nationalise him immediately. Shall I start a petition or would you care to kick it off?\u201d I\u2019m going to enjoy how this reads from anyone logging on via the Australian sport section. A few of the emails coming in about underwhelming autograph experiences are, frankly, a tad dispiriting and don\u2019t reflect well on the athletes involved, who don\u2019t have a right to reply. However, Philip Malcolm, I did very much enjoy your bouncebackability from being rebuffed by Beefy to finding the John Hancock of Dalton Grant. Here\u2019s a callback to day one of the first Test when Jofra Archer was presented in SKy\u2019s promotional graphics wearing Ben Stokes\u2019s shirt. \u201cYou\u2019ll be pleased to know Jofra now has his own shirt with the 693 on it, and his initials on the sleeve.\u201d Thanks Romeo. \u201cI have three autographs,\u201d opens Ian Forth, tantalisingly, \u201cChris \u201cSpider\u201d Cattlin, Coventry City left back of the early \u201870s, and later proprietor of a rock shop on Brighton seafront. I bearded the great man in his den, much to my wife\u2019s chagrin, on a weekend away where we reminisced about the time he broke a Stoke winger\u2019s leg. (\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u201d.) Also Robert Smith and Simon Gallup of The Cure, who I met in a bar in 1979 before they went on the (very small stage). They kindly signed the back of my Lloyd\u2019s Bank statement which was the only thing I had in my pocket. An unlikely trio, although one day I look forward to the four of us getting together.\u201d Marvellous. Moving swiftly on, Ali Martin made sure to document Jofra Afrcher\u2019s utterances following play yesterday. I\u2019m over the moon to get six wickets. I guess these are the things you train for. If you train hard in the game you should be rewarded eventually. [And] I don\u2019t need to run in and bowl 90mph every spell to get wickets. It\u2019s shown that today. \u201cApart from the whole Jofra thing,\u201d Paul Mitchell begins, before getting to the heart of the matter, \u201cthere seems to be something even more significant going on in cricket, where the OBO gets an opening act. Perhaps you will be seen in future as Queen to Geoff Lemon\u2019s Mott the Hoople?\u201d I can only dream Paul, I can only dream. Mogwai were the first support act I ever saw at a gig (Manic Street Preachers headlining). I\u2019d be happy with that level of understated but knowledgable acclaim. If you would like to remind yourself how we got to where we are, Vic Marks has put a sufficient number of words in the right order for just that job. Half a day\u2019s play was enough to have us salivating over this Test. Australia had been hanging on grimly, most especially against the irrepressible Jofra Archer, who quickly confirmed he is no one-Test wonder. Joe Root keeps throwing him the ball and he keeps bowling fast. On Thursday he was England\u2019s most exercised bowler once again and their most feared; he finished with six for 45 from 17.1 overs. Pitch: We saw plenty of movement in the air and off the seam yesterday and there should again be something in the deck for the pacemen today. However, it is the dryness of the surface that is catching the eye with the spinners likely to become an increasing factor as the Test progresses. Weather: What a difference a day makes. The gloom and drizzle of yesterday has been replaced by azure skies and a beaming sun. The temperature will be in the low to mid 20s for most of the day with a moderate southerly breeze keeping the unwary on their toes. In short; ideal conditions for batting. What have Chris Old and Peter Haddock got to do with this? Well, during my schooling I was only ever visited by one ex-pro of any sport to deliver any kind of clinic. That was 46-Test seamer Old, back in the mid-eighties. He therefore became the first, and for a long-time only, signature in my autograph book. Seven or eight years later we went on a school trip to Leeds United. Ignoring the queues for headline acts like Gordon Strachan and Lee Chapman, I sidled up to the nearest guy in a Top Man shell suit. That man was rugged defender Peter Haddock. Anyway, the other day I was rummaging through my old box of stuff that somehow survives house moves and periodic culls of useless ephemera, and located my not-so prized possession and its modest contents. I thought that was a suitably Yorkshire tale to share during the Headingley Test. And had me wondering whether anybody has a more underwhelming autograph hunting experience? Hello everybody and welcome to the Jofra Archer Show second day of the third Ashes Test from Headingley. England will begin their first innings at 11am after dismissing Australia yesterday for 179, the consequence of Joe Root winning the toss and offering his attack extremely helpful overhead conditions. And, aside from a third-wicket wobble, that attack grasped the opportunity with both hands, thanks in no small part to another starring performance from Jofra Archer. The speedster\u2019s six for 45 showed there is guile as well as raw pace in the armoury. Not to mention a handy knack of controlling the progress of a match in accordance to his will. I\u2019ll be with you for the next hour or so to regale you with tales of Chris Old and Peter Haddock, but when the rubber meets the road Geoff Lemon and his award-winning words will take over. If you want to join in this pre-play fun you can drop me an email or a tweet.",

The Labour leader claimed the government was \u201cfailing a whole generation of children\u201d and vowed his party would \u201cunlock the potential of every child, not just a lucky few\u201d as he helped to serve lunches, alongside the MP for Swansea East, Carolyn Harris. He pointed to Labour policies including extending free school meals to all primary schoolchildren, ending the benefits cap, and building 1m affordable homes. Boris Johnson\u2019s government has already made a string of manifesto-ready promises, on everything from boosting police numbers to improving hospital food, fuelling speculation that he is preparing for an early poll, either after Brexit day \u2013 or earlier, if he is forced into it. Corbyn meanwhile hopes to tempt back many of those remain supporters who deserted the party for the Liberal Democrats and the Green party at May\u2019s European elections. Labour agreed a more forthright Brexit position before the summer, which has seen Corbyn repeatedly promise a referendum \u2013 and allowed key shadow cabinet figures including Diane Abbott and John McDonnell to say publicly they would campaign for remain. Corbyn is poised to table a motion of no confidence in Johnson\u2019s government when MPs return from their summer break in early September. If Johnson lost the vote, there would then be a two-week period for a government that could command a majority to emerge. Corbyn has proposed to other MPs wanting to stop no deal that he would lead a time-limited \u201ccaretaker\u201d administration to request an extension to article 50, which would then dissolve itself and call a general election. He plans to discuss the idea at a meeting with other anti-no-deal MPs on Tuesday, though some, including the former Conservative Nick Boles, have declined the offer. Labour\u2019s chances of success are also in doubt, with some potential Tory rebels tempted to stay their hand, given Johnson\u2019s insistence in Berlin and Paris this week that he is seeking a deal. The Green MP, Caroline Lucas, wrote to Corbyn on Friday to accept his invitation, however, and urged others to follow suit.

By <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/climate-deniers/koch-industries/\">Greenpeace\u2019s reckoning</a>, in the 20 years to 2017, the Kochs ploughed about $127m into 92 groups that were involved in rebuffing climate crisis solutions.</p> <p>\u201cDavid Koch won\u2019t live to see the worst of climate change but the legacy of denial and the intensified delay caused by his funding will live on,\u201d said Kert Davies, director of the Climate Investigation Center. \u201cIt is clear that he provided life support to the denial machine.\u201d</p> <p>Koch\u2019s similarly self-interested desire to drive government out of the US economy by undermining regulations and slashing corporate taxes started to firm up in 1980, when he stood as the Libertarian party\u2019s vice-presidential candidate. By then, many of his other passions were also taking form, including abolishing social security and rolling back welfare benefits for low-income Americans.</p> <p>In 1977 he supported Charles in founding and funding the libertarian Cato Institute. But it was not until 2004 that the true embodiment of the brothers\u2019 desire to reshape the country was born: Americans for Prosperity. \u201cAFP was the vehicle for their dreams of channeling their politics into what would become almost a shadow Republican party,\u201d Graves said.</p> <p>Through AFP, the Kochs spawned a nationwide web of impassioned conservative volunteers, empowered by the new voter technology they supported through the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/koch-brothers-rnc-113359\">political data firm i360</a>. Among the key targets of their campaigning: the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which brought healthcare to millions of Americans but which the Kochs saw as big government interference. But it also took on climate crisis regulations, public education and taxes and championed the nascent 2010 Tea Party movement.</p> <p>In the past couple of years, David Koch, and his arguably even more ideologically driven brother Charles, have perhaps been less prevalent on the right as their political pulling power has appeared to wane a little. That might be in part due to David\u2019s deteriorating health as he began to lose his 20-year battle with prostate cancer, stepping down from all his business and political roles last year.</p> <p>It is also in large part due to the advent of Trump. There has been much discussion in recent months about the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/us/politics/trump-koch-brothers.html\">very public spat</a> between the president and the Koch brothers, with the Kochs calling Trump\u2019s trade tariffs \u201cdetrimental\u201d and Trump lashing back that the billionaires were \u201ca total joke\u201d.</p> <p>With the exception of trade policy, which is anathema to the free market Koch view of the world, the truth about Trump, though, is that he has adopted many of the rightwing postures the Kochs have long espoused.</p> <p>Take Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, which cost $1.5tn to the benefit of the rich above all others. The cuts follow a script very similar to the plan put forward by the Koch brothers \u2013 which helps explain why they went on to spend more than <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/tax-bill-2017/card/1513859346\">$20m promoting the legislation</a>.</p> <p>But then, in the calculation of <a href=\"https://americansfortaxfairness.org/koch-brothers-1-billion-tax-cut/\">Americans for Tax Fairness</a>, David Koch and Charles would have saved more than $1bn themselves in income tax.</p> <p>In David Koch\u2019s passing on Friday America has lost a lion of conservatism whose backing for ultra-rightwing causes was cherished by fellow billionaires, corporations, polluters \u2013 even some supreme court justices. But members of that elite club of \u201cFreedom Partners\u201d should find solace in the thought that \u2013 though David Koch will no longer be there to greet them at their secretive retreats \u2013 his influence is still very present, right there in the White House.</p>",

With the exception of trade policy, which is anathema to the free market Koch view of the world, the truth about Trump, though, is that he has adopted many of the rightwing postures the Kochs have long espoused. Take Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, which cost $1.5tn to the benefit of the rich above all others. The cuts follow a script very similar to the plan put forward by the Koch brothers \u2013 which helps explain why they went on to spend more than $20m promoting the legislation. But then, in the calculation of Americans for Tax Fairness, David Koch and Charles would have saved more than $1bn themselves in income tax. In David Koch\u2019s passing on Friday America has lost a lion of conservatism whose backing for ultra-rightwing causes was cherished by fellow billionaires, corporations, polluters \u2013 even some supreme court justices. But members of that elite club of \u201cFreedom Partners\u201d should find solace in the thought that \u2013 though David Koch will no longer be there to greet them at their secretive retreats \u2013 his influence is still very present, right there in the White House.",

I\u2019ve had a very consistent last two years [in which he won the Australian Open twice, Wimbledon in 2017 and reached the 2019 final after beating Rafa Nadal in the semis].</p> <p>\u201cEven though my back locked up on me in Montreal, and I struggled here as well, I\u2019ve been playing well recently again. My win over Rafa at Wimbledon was big for me. I\u2019m happy with my game.\u201d</p> <p>But Federer revealed camping in the Swiss Alps with his wife and children did much to erase memories of losing to Djokovic in a championship decider that built to a draining crescendo in the game\u2019s first 12-12 tie\u2011break in the final set. \u201cI struggled a little bit the first couple of days after that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then I was caravanning with my kids so I didn\u2019t have that much time to think about all the missed opportunities. I was setting up tables and organising my life for my four children, driving around the beautiful countryside in Switzerland.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I had flashbacks: should have done that, could have done that. But next day, having a glass of wine with your wife and you\u2019re thinking, actually the tennis was pretty good, being in the final was very good. You go a couple of days when you get those things out of your system. Then first couple of days back playing tennis, you have a few flashbacks.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m very happy I was part of an entertaining match. The crowd paid big money to be part of it. I put up a great fight. Someone had to win. Novak was the better man on the day. It\u2019s tough but I\u2019ve been there before. Had some tough losses, some great wins as well. I\u2019m not too down on myself.\u201d</p> <p>While Djokovic needs only four majors to draw alongside Federer\u2019s all\u2011time high of 20, the Swiss\u2019s career\u2011long nemesis has been Nadal, who owns 18. It is a curiosity that, although they have played each other 40 times in 15 years, they have not met at the US Open. Sadly for their rivalry, and the fans, the only chance of another showdown is in the final. The Spaniard, who has by far the easier draw, is the more likely to be there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/23/us-open-form-guide-naomi-osaka-ashleigh-barty-karolina-pliskova-simona-halep-serena-williams-tennis\">US Open form guide: Naomi Osaka faces struggle to retain title | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nadal leads 24-16 overall since beating Federer in the second round of the Miami Masters in 2004, one of 20 collisions in ATP 1000 events, to go with four matches at the Australian Open, six at Roland Garros, four at Wimbledon and five in the end\u2011of\u2011year ATP Tour Finals.</p> <p>Federer insists there is life in the old dogs yet but recognises the growing claims of Stefanos Tsitsipas, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev, who beat Djokovic in Cincinnati last week.</p> <p>\u201cNow that Novak, Rafa and me are healthy, with Andy [Murray] also slowly coming back again, it has made it much harder for the young guys to come through.

I was setting up tables and organising my life for my four children, driving around the beautiful countryside in Switzerland. \u201cSometimes I had flashbacks: should have done that, could have done that. But next day, having a glass of wine with your wife and you\u2019re thinking, actually the tennis was pretty good, being in the final was very good. You go a couple of days when you get those things out of your system. Then first couple of days back playing tennis, you have a few flashbacks. \u201cBut I\u2019m very happy I was part of an entertaining match. The crowd paid big money to be part of it. I put up a great fight. Someone had to win. Novak was the better man on the day. It\u2019s tough but I\u2019ve been there before. Had some tough losses, some great wins as well. I\u2019m not too down on myself.\u201d While Djokovic needs only four majors to draw alongside Federer\u2019s all\u2011time high of 20, the Swiss\u2019s career\u2011long nemesis has been Nadal, who owns 18. It is a curiosity that, although they have played each other 40 times in 15 years, they have not met at the US Open. Sadly for their rivalry, and the fans, the only chance of another showdown is in the final. The Spaniard, who has by far the easier draw, is the more likely to be there. Nadal leads 24-16 overall since beating Federer in the second round of the Miami Masters in 2004, one of 20 collisions in ATP 1000 events, to go with four matches at the Australian Open, six at Roland Garros, four at Wimbledon and five in the end\u2011of\u2011year ATP Tour Finals. Federer insists there is life in the old dogs yet but recognises the growing claims of Stefanos Tsitsipas, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev, who beat Djokovic in Cincinnati last week. \u201cNow that Novak, Rafa and me are healthy, with Andy [Murray] also slowly coming back again, it has made it much harder for the young guys to come through. But they are definitely knocking on the door big-time now. That\u2019s very encouraging for those who want to see somebody else win. \u201cNovak\u2019s domination, and Rafa\u2019s, is not normal. In tennis, we know how close the margins are. If you win 55 to 60% of the points in a match, you\u2019re dominating. It\u2019s that close. But it seems like the same guys are favourites again this time around. I\u2019d be surprised if anyone else won.\u201d",

It has previously been claimed that O\u2019Mara, who was formerly with Labour before becoming an independent, has submitted paperwork for his resignation as an MP for Sheffield Hallam, dated for when parliament returns in September. In July, O\u2019Mara said he was \u201ctaking time out for mental health treatment\u201d and promised to resign at the end of summer recess after allegations of sexual misconduct towards staff. Arnold quit his role in July in dramatic fashion, posting his resignation statement on O\u2019Mara\u2019s Twitter account, however earlier this month he claimed to be still working for the outgoing MP. Arnold told the BBC two weeks ago that he had \u201cextended his notice period\u201d but admitted he had not been cleared by parliamentary authorities to work in the office, including having access to O\u2019Mara\u2019s official email account.

Being forced to gound-share added to their financial woes, and they were ultimately unable to start the 1992\u201393 season. A new Maidstone United were founded by fans, and the club now plays in the National League, the division below League Two.</p>\n    <p><b>Aldershot</b></p>\n    <p>Aldershot had been debt-laden for several years in the late eighties and early nineties. At one point it seemed they had been saved by teenage property developer Spencer Trethewy, although it transpired he did not have the funds he claimed. The club played their final league game in March 1992, and resigned from the league after becoming insolvent.</p>\n    <p>In response a group of supporters set up a new club, Aldershot Town, which started five levels below the division, and now play in the National League,</p>\n    <p><b>Leeds United</b></p>\n    <p>The former chairman Peter Ridsdale famously said the Yorkshire club \u201clived the dream\u201d during a period when they reached the Champions League semi-finals but vastly over-reached financially, were relegated and slid down to the third tier of English football in 2007 after entering administration. It has been a slow road back and the club has not been back in the top division since.</p>\n    <p><b>Portsmouth</b></p>\n    <p>Two years after winning the FA Cup, in 2010 they became the first Premier League club to go into administration, owing \u00a3135m. They slid down the divisions, ending up in the bottom tier and only surviving thanks to the tireless efforts of supporters. But since the Portsmouth supporters trust took control of the club in 2014, the feel-good factor has returned. It is now owned by the former Disney chief executive Michael Eisner.</p>\n    <p><b>Southampton</b></p>\n    <p>After a free-spending period, the club were relegated in 2005 and four years later were relegated into the third tier, went into administration and teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. But the club recovered to win back-to-back promotions and remain a rehabilitated force in the Premier League.</p>\n    <p><b>Darlington</b></p>\n    <p>A move to a new 25,000-capacity stadium in 2003 was a factor in driving the club into administration in 2012 and, because it could not pay its creditors, being expelled by the Football Association. Fans immediately formed a new club called Darlington 1883 and started again from the ninth tier of English football. In 2012, the FA approved its request to change its name back to Darlington FC.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some businesses are already suffering due to the club\u2019s postponed start to the season.

You can\u2019t have people buying a club for a pound and bleeding it dry,\u201d she said. \u201cClubs like this for small towns \u2013 it\u2019s the heart and soul of the community. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d Andy Moore, 62, a season ticket holder for more than 30 years, waited for news outside Gigg Lane. His son, also a lifelong Bury fan, was born on the day they won the Lancashire Cup in 1983 \u2013 36 years ago on Saturday. \u201cHe\u2019s in bits at the minute. You just feel powerless.\u201d Moore said he could not contemplate supporting another club if Bury were expelled. \u201cThat\u2019s it \u2013 finished,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a focal point for people. If you take that from the town then what\u2019s left? We will be remembered for the wrong reasons \u2013 the town that lost its football team.\u201d",

Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside Brazil\u2019s embassy in central London on Friday with placards reading: \u201cThe planet deserves better\u201d and \u201cOur house is on fire\u201d. \u201cBolsonaro wants to destroy the forest \u2026 and we do not want this,\u201d one indigenous leader from Brazil told the crowd. There were also rallies outside Brazil\u2019s embassies in Mexico City and Paris, where demonstrators reportedly carried banners reading: \u201cFora Bolsonaro!\u201d or \u201cBolsonaro, out!\u201d Protesters also surrounded the Brazilian consulate in Geneva while further marches were planned in cities including Adelaide, Lisbon, Stockholm, Boston and Florida. Brazil\u2019s far-right president has rejected the international outcry over the fires raging in the Amazon and his stance on the environment. Bolsonaro on Thursday painted the barrage of criticism as part of a foreign conspiracy that might eventually be used to justify a foreign \u201cintervention\u201d in the Amazon. \u201cThis happens all over the world, it\u2019s not just in Brazil,\u201d he said of the fires decimating the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest. Bolsonaro\u2019s politician son, Eduardo, claimed criticism of his father was part of an international intrigue designed to damage his government. \u201cThe GLOBAL left has come together in a clear attack against president Jair Bolsonaro,\u201d he tweeted. R\u00f4mulo Batista, a Greenpeace campaigner in the Amazon, said such claims \u2013 and Bolsonaro\u2019s baseless insinuation that NGOs were behind the fires \u2013 were merely an attempt to deflect from Bolsonaro\u2019s own responsibility for the environment calamity. \u201cHe is trying to hide behind a smokescreen,\u201d Batista said.

Or inaction, in the case of Bury Football Club, the beleaguered club whose fifth consecutive League One fixture of the season has been postponed. The Shakers are staring down the barrel of expulsion from the Football League unless their owner, Steve Dale, can sell the club or satisfy the EFL he has the funds to pay their debts and the \u00a31.5m running costs for the season by 11.59pm tonight. We\u2019ll keep tabs on the situation at Gigg Lane and keep you up to date on all the other football news that\u2019s fit to print \u2013 and much else that probably isn\u2019t as the day unfolds.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e69957f60e2b8a695ea74f85c92caa56472cb593\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e69957f60e2b8a695ea74f85c92caa56472cb593/0_71_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bury FC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bury FC could be expelled from the Football League when the clock strikes midnight.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STRINGER/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-23T08:49:15.483Z\">at 9.49am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for reading. Time to sign off although don\u2019t forget there is Premier League action this evening in the form of Aston Villa v Everton. That one kicks off at 8pm BST and we\u2019ll have full minute-by-minute coverage. Bye for now. Bury: An addition to the statement. \u201cThe EFL will move to confirm the position as soon as possible, with an update to be provided on Saturday 24 August.\u201d Meanwhile, here\u2019s David Conn reporting on how former club secretary Jill Neville wrote a heartfelt letter to Steve Dale, asking him to give up control of Bury. A statement fresh from the Football League: \u201cThe EFL Board has this afternoon been appraised of the very latest position in respect of ongoing matters at Bury Football Club. \u201cAs of 5pm there has been limited progress made either by the current ownership providing the required evidence in regard to outstanding financial information, or through a change of control being achieved with new owners. \u201cThe EFL will continue to provide all support available and will keep working to find a resolution to the ongoing issues ahead of the Notice of Withdrawal deadline, which remains at 11.59 PM on Friday 23 August. \u201cIf a successful solution is not found ahead of tonight\u2019s deadline, the Club\u2019s share in the EFL will be withdrawn and its membership in the League will come to an end.\u201d Liverpool v Arsenal: The top two clash at Anfield in Saturday\u2019s 5.30pm BST. There must surely be goals. Sheffield United v Leicester: Time for Leicester to show us their top six credentials? It won\u2019t be easy against the buoyant Blades. Watford v West Ham: The two W\u2019s have accumulated just a single point between them so far this season. Who wins on Saturday? Brighton v Southampton: The sun appears to have returned so let\u2019s head to the south coast for a bit of derby fun. Man Utd v Crystal Palace: Zaha v Wan-Bissaka. Upgraded from a training ground duel at Selhurst Park to a full-on encounter at Old Trafford. Here\u2019s our preview of Saturday\u2019s game. Norwich v Chelsea: Let\u2019s ping some previews your way, starting with Saturday\u2019s 12.30pm BST kick-off at Carrow Road. Bury: Could closure prove a blessing in disguise for Bury? That\u2019s a hard idea to swallow but Chester director Jeff Banks believes a fresh start would be no bad thing. Chester went bust in 2010 and were expelled from the National League but are now a fan-owned team in the National League North. They average just under 1,800 fans in the sixth tier but their long-term goal is a return to the English Football League. Speaking to PA, Banks said: \u201cMy advice to Bury fans now would be to stay strong. If the worst happens, it might end up being the best thing in the long run. If they haven\u2019t already started, start planning for the future and stop thinking about the past. It will take unity and a lot of hard work but it can also be a lot of fun.\u201d Bury: The clock ticks on although the PA news agency understands that there is another buyer in talks with the league. It qualifies the glimmer of hope by pointing out owner Steve Dale\u2019s demands, the club\u2019s \u201cchaotic balance sheet\u201d and the lack of time available to seal such a deal. Manchester City: Few would question Pep Guardiola\u2019s judgement of a player but the City boss admits he got it all wrong about David Silva when the Spanish playmaker moved to the Premier League from Valencia in 2010. With Silva set to make his 400th City appearance on Sunday, Guardiola said: \u201cHe\u2019s a tiny little player. My image of English football when I was outside, I thought, \u2018Maybe he\u2019s going to suffer\u2019, but I was happily, happily wrong. \u201cTo do 400 games means many years, many bad moments and many good moments and being there day-by-day, week-by-week and I admire that. You can make a good season, but he\u2019s done it for almost 10. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. For City fans, me included, it\u2019s a privilege to see what he\u2019s done at the club. He\u2019s one of the most incredible, intelligent players.\u201d Here he is in 2010 stood next to a table tennis net Tottenham: \u201cFootball is about today and tomorrow not yesterday,\u201d says Spurs Mauricio Pochettino, sounding a bit like that man the Beatles went to see. Except without the football reference. His point is that he doesn\u2019t owe it to players who did well in the past and, boy, does he labour it. \u201cWe are not a charity first of all. It is about performance and we are the coaching staff and we have a lot of options to play to play different players. \u201cIf I play Davinson (Sanchez) and Toby (Alderweireld), why not play Jan (Vertonghen)? If play Davinson and Jan, why not Toby?\u201d Okay, we get the point but he continues ... \u201cIf play (Ben) Davies, why not Danny (Rose)?\u201d. Got ya. Nope, wait, there\u2019s more. \u201cIf I play Danny why not Davies? (Harry) Winks and not (Eric) Dier? Dier, why not (Victor) Wanyama? We can stay here one hour talking about that.\u201d It certainly felt like that. Chelsea: Ever the optimist, Frank Lampard believes Chelsea could have won all three games so far had they been more clinical in attack. That\u2019s something of a stretch given that one of those was a 4-0 loss but let\u2019s not quibble with such minor details. Tammy Abraham, Olivier Giroud and Michy Batshuayi have a combined tally of zero goals in the Premier League so far but Lampard is backing his striking trio to come good. \u201cAs I said before, if we\u2019d have been more clinical in front of goal we possibly could have had three wins. The competition is there and that\u2019s the challenge for the strikers. \u201cI\u2019ve got no problems with their attitude and training. We work hard on the training ground as a team to create and also to finish. I used to love practising my finishing in training. \u201cWhat I have got is great attitude in the three strikers. But others in the squad also always want to stay out, want to work harder. \u201cTammy\u2019s goal goes in off the post against United, different story for him, different story for the game. But we can\u2019t get too down about that, we\u2019ve got to stay positive and it will come. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some great attacking players here and it will come.\u201d Bury: And now the Liberal Democrats have chimed in on the situation at Bury. Jane Brophy MEP, Chris Davies MEP and Councillor Andy Kelly \u2013 all senior Liberal Democrats in the North \u2013 have released a joint statement setting out a plan to ensure the financial security of professional clubs in the region. \u201cWith 134 years of history set to be wiped at midnight, the North West Liberal Democrats are calling for radical action to save Football League clubs which are being hit by financial and mismanagement issues. The reckless actions of Steve Dale are proof of this. \u201cThe lack of financial support Bury FC has received from the football community demonstrates that now is the time for political parties to step forward and find a solution to their problems. Lib Dems are therefore calling for the immediate creation of a means-tested \u2018Greater Manchester Football Fighting Fund\u2019, which each of the region\u2019s professional clubs will contribute towards. \u201cThis will help preserve the historic footballing institutions that our city has become so famous for and ensure staff can rest assured that their jobs are no longer hanging in limbo. \u201cFinally, we insist Steve Dale sells the club at the earliest possible opportunity. It cannot be right that one man\u2019s actions can hold a much-loved institution such as Bury FC to ransom. Our plans today will mean that history does not repeat itself.\u201d Bury: As the clock ticks, here is Burnley boss Sean Dyche on the troubling events down the A56. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us want to see clubs struggling, and certainly not in this location. When I came here it was a hotbed of football and there\u2019s been a few ups and downs round here over the last few years. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants football clubs going out of business, or whatever comes next if someone doesn\u2019t save them. \u201cIt is the trials and tribulations of football - spending against the balance against the safety of a club, the health of a club. We\u2019re certainly one that\u2019s on the right side of that. \u201cFor whatever reason, clubs find themselves in difficulty and then someone usually has to come and clean all that up and sort everything out. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all hopeful that something does happen today.\u201d Rangers: Here\u2019s the full story of Rangers being ordered to close a section of Ibrox when they host Legia Warsaw after Uefa ruled some of their fans were guilty of \u201cracist behaviour\u201d \u2013 specifically, sectarian chants. Applauded off: Thanks to Barry, who put in a stint alien to any England batsman at Headingley. Handover: I\u2019m going for a lie-down in a darkened room, but thanks for your time and attention. Dave Tindall will take over, to bring you news of any further updates on the situation at Bury and the world of football in general. Manchester City: In news of a slightly less impoverished outfit in the north-west, Manchester City will be without John Stones for their visit to Bournemouth on Sunday. The defender is sidelined with a muscle problem, while Benjamin Mendy is back in training but not yet ready to play following the knee injury which kept him out for most of last season. City have never lost to or even drawn with against Bournemouth City head to Bournemouth on Sunday to face a team they have never lost to. \u201cWe know each other quite well for the fact that it is the same managers from four years ago,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThey have the same points as us after two games and they won away [against Aston Villa] when it is difficult to go to a newly promoted team in the first game of the season. They are defending incredibly well, setting up deep with a 5-4-1 or a 5-3-2, and they attack really well in the channels and from set-pieces so it is always tough.\u201d Bolton Wanderers: \u201cFormer Bolton boss Phil Parkinson has spoken out following his resignation from the club this week, to say he left with \u201ca heavy heart\u201d. Along with his assistant Steve Parkin, the 51-year-old resigned from from the beleaguered League One club yesterday. Two days previously, Bolton\u2019s fixture against Doncaster was postponed amid welfare concerns for the club\u2019s younger players - who have had to play this season due to a transfer embargo imposed after the club went into administration. \u201cIt has been an honour to represent Bolton Wanderers Football Club over the past three years,\u201d said Parkin in a statement released by the League Managers\u2019 Association. \u201cIt was with a heavy heart that I made the decision to leave. Despite the testing times for all involved, I am proud of the efforts of everyone who has fought for the integrity and survival of this historic club. \u201cDespite the various challenges we faced, I will always reflect on my time here with fondness. Especially our memorable promotion season in 2016/17, in which we became the first club to achieve a promotion under a transfer embargo, and the following season, as we retained our status as a Championship club. \u201cMy staff and I were keen to continue to lead the club through the summer and prepare the squad for the new season whilst the possible take-over options were explored. Having worked through this period and into the new season, I believe it is now the right time to step aside and allow a new manager the opportunity to rebuild the squad and take the club forward. \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff at Bolton Wanderers Football Club, for their constant support. I would like to thank the loyal supporters who have backed the players and coaching staff through thick and thin and I would like to thank the players, past and present, who have worked hard to improve the fortunes of this club on the pitch. \u201cI wish Bolton Wanderers the very best of luck and I hope for a brighter future, as those who support this club truly deserve to see Bolton Wanderers thrive again.\u201d Bolton\u2019s protracted takeover by Football Ventures has dragged out into the start of the current season, with the club having only seven senior players on their books. Wanderers started on minus 12 points but earned a goalless draw at home against Coventry on August 10 with what was the youngest ever team in the club\u2019s history. Academy boss Jimmy Phillips will take charge for the home match against Ipswich on Saturday. Meanwhile at Headingley: Things have gone from bad to worse to downright diabolical for England, who have been skittled for 67 runs in their first innings of third Ashes Test against Australia, who have put on a masterclass of bowling and catching today. Geoff Lemon oop north to bring you the latest ... Chelsea: N\u2019Golo Kante could miss Chelsea\u2019s Premier League trip to Norwich due to an ankle injury, while Antonio Rudiger is not quite ready for a return from a spell on the sidelines being tipped to play some part this weekend. \u201cKante has got an injury he has carried all week, so we\u2019ll assess that over the next 24 hours,\u201d said Frank Lampard. \u201cRudiger\u2019s not fit yet, hopefully for next week. That\u2019s the only changes from where we were last week.\u201d Liverpool: J\u00fcrgen Klopp has been singing the praises of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has signed a new deal that will tie him to the club until 2023. \u201cIt was a very good week for him and for us,\u201d he said of the midfielder. \u201cHe\u2019s in the best shape I remember and mentally is very good.\u201d Goalkeeper Alisson Becker is still out indefinitely, having injured his calf during Liverpool\u2019s opening day win against Norwich. \u201cAlisson is not that close,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cHe\u2019s in a good mood but there\u2019s no date in my mind.\u201d Still at Headingley: The good news is that England have got two more runs. The bad news is that they\u2019ve lost another wicket and are 56-8. Meanwhile at Headingley: Oh dear. Australia have taken another English wicket with their first ball after lunch. England are on 54-7 and trail by 125 in the third Ashes Test. Follow the action here ... Rangers: Meanwhile in Scotland, Rangers have been ordered to close a section of Ibrox for the return leg of their Europa League qualifier against Legia Warsaw next Thursday. About 3,000 seats will be empty as Rangers attempt to qualify for the group stages of this year\u2019s competition, following yesterday\u2019s scoreless draw in the first leg in Poland. The punishment comes after Uefa found Rangers fans guilty of sectarian chanting in a an earlier qualifying win over St Joseph\u2019s from Gibraltar. \u201cRangers has been ordered by Uefa to close a section of Ibrox Stadium for the return leg of the club\u2019s Europa League play-off tie against Legia Warsaw on Thursday, August 29,\u201d read a club statement. \u201cUefa has ruled that a group of Rangers supporters were guilty of racist behaviour \u2013 which includes sectarian singing \u2013 during the match against St Joseph\u2019s at Ibrox on July 18. Our supporters have been asked repeatedly by the club to refrain from indulging in this, and other forms of unacceptable behaviour. Sadly, the warnings have fallen on deaf ears and the actions of this minority will cause the club and the majority of good and decent Rangers supporters to pay a heavy penalty. \u201cUefa has ruled that a section, or sections containing no fewer than 3,000 seats must be shut off during the club\u2019s next European match, which is the home match against Legia Warsaw. The area, or areas to be closed will be announced in due course and the club will do its best to restrict the impact to offending supporters. \u201cUnfortunately a significant number of supporters, innocent of any wrong doing, will be unable to attend next week\u2019s match. This is deeply regrettable to all at the club and we hope that the guilty parties, who attracted the attention of Uefa might reflect on the damage their unacceptable behaviour is causing Rangers and their fellow supporters. \u201cIf any individual supporter is unable to behave in a civilised manner then please stay away from Ibrox and our club. You are harming Rangers and that is something a genuine supporter would never wish to do.\u201d Sheffield United: Chris Wilder has been speaking ahead of his side\u2019s match against Leicester city at Bramall Lane tomorrow, telling reporters how much he admires Jamie Vardy, a Sheffield Wednesday supporter. \u201cI have got nothing but respect for his career and what he has done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a great inspiration for a lot of non-league players. My career in coaching and management started out in non-league and I have a lot of affiliation and love for the grassroots game. He is the star performer in terms of where he started and where he has finished. \u201cThere is a lot of respect from me towards Jamie and how well he has done. And still, looking at the clips against Chelsea last weekend and the desire in his face, he still has that desire and hunger that has taken him to the very top.\u201d Callum Robinson has recovered from injury and is expected to be involved against Leicester, after being forced off during the win against Crystal Palace. John Fleck also hobbled off with an injury last weekend and a late decision will be made on the midfielder\u2019s fitness. Arsenal: As his side prepare to face Liverpool tomorrow, Unai Emery has told reporters Arsenal must improve their record against the Premier League\u2019s best sides if they are to force their way back into the top four. Arsenal failed to beat any of their top six rivals away from home last season. \u201cWe need to [improve] because, when we are playing against them, it\u2019s three points that you can take and they cannot take,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after that you need also to achieve the three points in other matches against other teams. \u201cIn 38 matches you are going to play at home and away 19 matches - against the top four and every team.\u201d Mesut Ozil could make his first appearance of the campaign for Arsenal tomorrow evening, while Granit Xhaka is also in contention after missing the win over Burnley with back bruising. Emery has told defender Shkodran Mustafi and midfielder Mohamed Elneny they should find new clubs before the European transfer window closes. Tottenham Hotspur: In what will come as good news for Newcastle, Tottenham have revealed that they will be without their record signing Tanguy Ndombele for the meeting of the two sides at White HArt Lane on Saturday. The French midfielder has a \u201cminor injury\u201d and has been ruled out for Sunday\u2019s clash, but Dele Alli is back training following a hamstring problem. Son Heung-min is back after suspension, but Ryan Sessegnon and Juan Foyth are both injury victims. Meanwhile at Headingley: Things could scarcely be more grim for England, who are 45-6 in the first innings of the third Ashes Test against Australia. Jonny Bairstow has just gone for four runs and Geoff Lemon has the latest from the ground ... Leicester City: Brendan Rodgers has been shooting the breeze ahead of Leicester\u2019s match against Sheffield United this weekend and has said he is unconcerned that Jamie Vardy, who scored 18 Premier League goals last season, has yet to get off the mark in this campaign. \u201cI\u2019m sure he would love to go back to Sheffield and open his account, I hope so.,\u201d he said of Vardy, who is a Sheffield Wednesday fan. \u201cHe\u2019s gone close on a few occasions. It\u2019s only a matter of time and he\u2019s a top class operator at this level. You can sense the fear when he\u2019s in front of goal and running towards goal and if he just keeps getting into those areas then the goals will come for him. I see that in training and in matches.\u201d Manchester United: Speaking on the future of Alexis Sanchez, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said that the Chilean playmaker could go out on loan before the European transfer window closes, but added that he had played in a behind-closed-doors practice match against Sheffield United at United\u2019s training ground on Tuesday. \u201cThere are still talks with some clubs,\u201d Solskjaer said, ahead of United\u2019s Premier League meeting against Crystal Palace. \u201cBut he played in that game and he played well. As I have said he is working well. Let\u2019s see in September what is going to happen.\u201d In recent days, Sanchez has been strongly linked with a loan move to Serie A side Inter. Meanwhile at Headingley: England are wobbling after a bad start to their first innings against Australia in the third Ashes Test. They\u2019re 20-3 with two batsmen on zero at the crease. Follow the action with Geoff Lemon ... Bury FC: While Steve Dale was making his quite extraordinary request on Talksport, Phil Neville, whose mother, Jill, and late father, Neville, had long associations with the club has been speaking to BBC 5 Live about the situation at the stricken club. The England women\u2019s manager confirmed that his mum has resigned her position as club secretary after 30 years. \u201cMy mum has worked there for 30 years, my dad\u2019s got a stand named after him and to consider that today they might not have a football club is so upsetting,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mum\u2019s devastated. She resigned on Friday because she couldn\u2019t work with the current ownership. Today common sense has to prevail. One man cannot stop one football club that has hundreds of years of history going out of existence. I pray that common sense today prevails and that somebody is allowed to buy that club and the town has something to be proud of again.\u201d On social media, Bury\u2019s fans have reacted with fury to their owner\u2019s request for pledges from both them and local businesses and urged anyone thinking of offering Dale money not to give him a penny. Bury FC: Speaking to Talksport presenter Jim White, Bury owner Steve Dale has pleaded with supporters and local businesses to club together and pledge \u00a32.7m to help save the club, despite claiming he doesn\u2019t actually need the money and is not looking for charity. \u201cFans, anyone out there who will pledge money to come to us \u2026 if they come to us and say we\u2019ll put \u00a3100 in, \u00a31000 in, if the big players put in \u00a3100,000, \u00a3500,000 .., whatever it is, we want it pledged to the company,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a pledge of \u00a32.7m plus to save Bury. If the company, Bury Football Club, needs the money and needs to use it, they\u2019ll put up shares and pay 2.5% interest on that money. We don\u2019t need it, let me say that, unless the EFL pull another stroke. \u201cSo what we\u2019re looking to do now is go out there and say to local businesses \u2013 we\u2019ve got massive firms in our areas, we\u2019ve got the Boohoo boys, Together Finance, the old card guy Ron Wood, we\u2019re got loads of people within Bury who will maybe look at it and think: \u2018well it\u2019s short change out of my pocket, I\u2019ll pledge some money\u2019. \u201cIf we take any money off someone we\u2019ll pay interest on it and we will secure it on shares in the club. Let me make this clear, we\u2019re not looking for charity here, because we don\u2019t need it. But the EFL want it. The EFL have made this ridiculous claim that we need this money, but we\u2019re saying we don\u2019t!\u201d Sunderland: US billionaire Michael Dell, the world\u2019s 25th richest man, is part of a group of investors closing in on a \u00a340m deal to take a controlling share at the League One club, according to the Sunderland Echo. \u201cStewart Donald revealed last weekend that he was \u2018confident\u2019 a deal could be reached that would help the club realise the current hierarchy\u2019s long-term vision for the club,\u201d the Echo reports. \u201cAmerican businessmen John Phelan, Glenn Fuhrman, Robert Platek and Michael Dell are understood to be the four prospective investors. Multi-billionaire Dell, ranked as one of the richest men in the world by Forbes, is the tech magnate behind Dell Technologies.\u201d It\u2019s good news for Sunderland, who not so long ago looked like they might be going the way of Bury and Bolton. Bury FC: Former Port Vale owner Norman Smurthwaite believes it is too late to save Bury because the crisis-hit club\u2019s owner Steve Dale wants at least 1million to walk away, according to PA Sport. Smurthwaite has made the only credible offer to save the club so far but it was rejected by Dale on Tuesday because it offered him nothing. \u201cIf Steve Dale accepted that neither he nor any of his associates get anything from [July\u2019s Company Voluntary Arrangement], or any other payment, then I am willing to step in,\u201d said Smurthwaite. \u201cThey are the two conditions of my offer. But I fear it is now too late to save the club because there is simply not enough time to do this deal. It could take three months. And if Dale finds some novice to take it on, Bury will be back in this mess next year.\u201d Bury FC: It seems that Steve Dale has appeared on Talksport to appeal to the club\u2019s fans to have a whip-around to save the club from going out of business. If nothing else, you have to admire his brass neck. More on this as we get it ... Celtic: Fraser Forster has completed a loan move to Celtic, who he left for Southampton in a \u00a310m move five years ago. The goalkeeper was reintroduced to Celtic\u2019s fans at half-time during their Europa League qualifier against AIK Solna last night. Forster has three years left on his deal with Southampton, but has made just one appearance for the club since Boxing Day in 2017, after falling behind Angus Gunn and Alex McCarthy in the pecking order. At Celtic he will be vying with Scott Bain and Craig Gordon for a place in the first team. Bain is expected to be out for the next four to six weeks with a thumb injury. Liverpool: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has inked a new deal committing him to Liverpool until 2023. The 26-year-old England international, who missed most of last season through injury, has extended his deal by a year. \u201cI\u2019m really, really excited,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of been talked about for quite a while now. It\u2019s been in the pipeline for a little while, so it\u2019s nice to finally get it done and just extend my time here, which I am really looking forward to. I feel like I missed out on a year, which I obviously did, but it\u2019s really exciting for me to be able to sign. It\u2019s something that I feel is an opportunity to give that year back and make up for lost time \u2013 and hopefully put in some good performances to make amends for not being around last year.\u201d Newcastle United: Newcastle boss Steve Bruce has called for calm as many of those around him \u2013 specifically his defenders and many of the club\u2019s fans \u2013 lose their heads following defeats at the hands of Arsenal and Norwich City, with a visit to White Hart Lane looming large. \u201cAfter two games, there\u2019s a so-called mini-crisis and all the rest of it and, as you say, that is over-sensationalised,\u201d he told reporters this morning. \u201cEverything seems to be that way. But look, I understand that, it\u2019s the nature of the club - it always has been. There\u2019s always a storm in Newcastle and at the minute, we\u2019re in one. The only way we can do it is to get a couple of results and the team to perform, and after two games, it\u2019s very, very early to judge just yet.\u201d Southampton: Goalkeeper Alex McCarthy has resumed full training following the unspecified fitness issue which saw him sit out the game against, with Fraser Forster - on the verge of completing a loan move to Celtic - replacing him on the bench. On loan from Augsburg, central defender Kevin Danso will be hoping to be involved, having been an unused substitute last weekend, but midfielder Mario Lemina is not expected to play and looks ready to leave before the end of the European transfer window. The midfielder has been linked with a move to Monaco. Provisional squad: Gunn, Yoshida, Vestergaard, Bertrand, Bednarek, Valery, Romeu, Ward-Prowse, Redmond, Hojbjerg, Adams, McCarthy, Soares, Danso, Djenepo, Armstrong, Ings, Obafemi. Brighton: Brighton boss Graham Potter has no fresh injury concerns ahead of Saturday\u2019s Premier League game with Southampton at the Amex Stadium. Jurgen Locadia is pushing for a recall after being dropped to the bench in favour of Leandro Trossard for last weekend\u2019s draw with West Ham, while winger Alireza Jahanbakhsh is hoping to be included in Albion squad for the first time this season. Winger Jose Izquierdo, defender Ezequiel Schelotto (both knee) and midfielder Yves Bissouma (shoulder) remain sidelined. Provisional squad: Ryan, Button, Montoya, Bernardo, Bong, Burn, Dunk, Duffy, Balogun, Webster, Stephens, Propper, Mooy, Gross, Jahanbakhsh, March, Locadia, Trossard, Murray, Andone, Maupay. Manchester United: Solskj\u00e6r also spoke about the far more serious of Pogba being racially abused by anonymous keyboard warriors on Twitter. \u201cPaul\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cPaul\u2019s a strong character and it makes him stronger. I just cannot believe we still sit here in 2019 talking about these instances. Social media is a place where, as Harry [Maguire] said, people can hide behind fake identities. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s down to me to change it but we\u2019ve got to do something about it and the authorities have got to do something about these ones that spread this hate. You just feel sorry for them really. They must have problems themselves when they have to do this.\u201d As Jamie Jackson, the Guardian\u2019s Reni hat-wearing man on the Manchester beat, reported yesterday, Manchester United and and Kick It Out will meet representatives of Twitter regarding concerns over racism and other abuse aimed at footballers on the social media platform. Manchester United: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has been addressing the ladies and gentlemen of the Fourth estate ahead of Manchester United\u2019s match against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford tomorrow. Quizzed on Paul Pogba\u2019s controversial penalty miss against Wolves on Monday night, he remains unfazed by the fact that the midfielder, who has missed four spot-kicks in 11 attempts for Manchester United, took the latest one ahead of Marcus Rashford. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to see Paul Pogba score a penalty for Man United again,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely. Let\u2019s see when we get the next one. We\u2019re practising penalties still and Marcus and Paul are still on them.\u201d On the subject of having two designated penalty takers, Solskj\u00e6r had this to say: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019ve left it to the players to sort out, we\u2019ve nominated two. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anarchy and do whatever you want. Last season we had Marcus, Jesse [Lingard], Paul, who all scored penalties, probably more as well. There\u2019s absolutely no fighting among them. We\u2019re disappointed that we didn\u2019t win the game but the talk is always more difficult when you don\u2019t get a result.\u201d Premier League: Ahead of this weekend\u2019s fixtures, beginning with Everton\u2019s trip to Villa Park tonight, we\u2019ve been surveying the top flight landscape through our binoculars, looking out for \u201cthings\u201d. Read on ... David Conn has the latest on Bury, who could get a short extension on their 11.59pm deadline for expulsion, but only, according to EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans, if there is a \u201ctangible\u201d reason such as realistic, well advanced takeover negotiations. Greetings and welcome to our countdown to another weekend of piping hot football action across the UK and beyond. Or inaction, in the case of Bury Football Club, the beleaguered club whose fifth consecutive League One fixture of the season has been postponed. The Shakers are staring down the barrel of expulsion from the Football League unless their owner, Steve Dale, can sell the club or satisfy the EFL he has the funds to pay their debts and the \u00a31.5m running costs for the season by 11.59pm tonight. We\u2019ll keep tabs on the situation at Gigg Lane and keep you up to date on all the other football news that\u2019s fit to print \u2013 and much else that probably isn\u2019t as the day unfolds.",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They began turning out long before the official 8pm start, old and young, office workers in suits standing beside students in the unofficial protest uniform of black clothes and face masks.</p> \n<p>Protesters cited the Baltic human chain as inspiration. \u201cIn that place, at that time, people tried to use this form of expression to express their wish for freedom from the Soviet state,\u201d said a protester named Kay, who declined to give her surname for fear she might be penalised at work for joining the protests.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn very similar terms, the Hong Kong people are trying to express themselves and express their yearning for freedom and basic human rights,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2cd086ff178110b2030c7e4dbd38ce4d2169ac2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2cd086ff178110b2030c7e4dbd38ce4d2169ac2/0_372_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters join hands outside the Hong Kong Space Museum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters join hands outside the Hong Kong Space Museum.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Unlike other protests that have snarled up the city, demonstrators stood in single file along pavements.

Chinese authorities later said Simon Cheng Man-kit had been detained for \u201cviolating public order regulations\u201d. China often uses public order charges against political targets, and has sometimes used the charge of soliciting prostitution. Ou Shaokun, an anti-corruption activist, alleged in 2015 that the authorities in southern Hunan province had framed him by saying they found him in a hotel room with a prostitute.",

The pilots will take industrial action on 9, 10 and 27 September in a move that BA said was likely to disrupt the plans of \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of passengers. The British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) said the airline had rejected its proposals to resolve the standoff and it had \u201cno choice but to call this action\u201d. The airline said it had offered a three-year deal of 11.5% that had been accepted by other BA employees, and it would \u201ccontinue to pursue every avenue to find a solution to avoid industrial action\u201d. The union said 93% had voted in favour of industrial action and there was no prospect of further meaningful talks. It urged the airline to seek an agreement but warned that further strikes were possible. The strikes are likely to cost the airline about \u00a340m a day; they take place in what is British Airways\u2019 centenary year. Balpa said pilots had made previous sacrifices to assist the company including cuts to salary, pension and leave, but the airline was now recording profits of \u00a32bn a year and the strike was \u201ca last resort and with enormous frustration at the way the business is now being run\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Ann Summers chief executive has accused some retail landlords of \u201cburying their heads in the sand\u201d by ignoring the crisis on the high street, after several refused to accept lower rents to support the chain. The sex toys and lingerie specialist has been struggling during a high street downturn. The Guardian revealed in May that it wanted to reduce its rent. Jacqueline Gold said the past year had \u201cbeen the toughest I can remember in my 38 years in the retail business\u201d. She set out Ann Summers\u2019 position in a frank column in Retail Week. After talks with landlords, Gold said the company had successfully negotiated new terms for almost all the chain\u2019s stores \u2013 95 out of 100 \u2013 but that it might have to use a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to deal with the remaining five outlets. A CVA is a form of insolvency that enables companies in difficulty to close unwanted stores and reduce rents on others. There had been a \u201cfundamental shift in the retail property\u201d, Gold said, and while the vast majority of landlords \u201clive in the real world\u201d others continued to \u201cbury their heads in the sand and pretend historic rental levels are sustainable in future\u201d. \u201cI continue to hope that the remaining landlords will come to the table and agree to sensible new terms that mean our stores can continue to trade,\u201d she added. Over the past two years numerous struggling retailers and restaurant chains, including Mothercare, New Look, Debenhams, Giraffe and Byron, have used CVAs to restructure their finances after being squeezed by rising costs at a time when consumers are cutting back on spending. Sales at Ann Summers were flat at about \u00a3110m in the year to 30 June, but a \u00a33.3m loss had replaced the previous year\u2019s \u00a32.9m profit, according to the most recent accounts filed at Companies House. The plunge into the red was blamed on higher sourcing costs, business taxes and investment in a new look for the 49-year-old brand. Ann Summers, which also organises 7,000 Tupperware-style parties a week for women to buy its sex toys and nightwear, has also been affected by the success of online rivals such as Lovehoney. The Bath-based website has grown rapidly and is close to overtaking its bricks-and-mortar rival in sales. Gold said: \u201cWe would be mad not to consider all options, including a CVA of that 5% of stores, because we cannot allow the future success of our business to be jeopardised by the handful of landlords who won\u2019t come to the table.\u201d",

But it did bring her opportunities to take character roles in groundbreaking television dramas. In Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit (1989), based on <a href=\"http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/about/\" title=\"\">Jeanette Winterson</a>\u2019s autobiographical novel about Jess, a girl growing up in a Pentecostal household in Lancashire and coming to understand her sexuality, she played Mrs Green, a fellow church member of the girl\u2019s controlling mother (Geraldine McEwan).

In the final episode, set in 1995, Nicky returns from Italy for Florrie\u2019s funeral, which marks the transfer of the \u201colder generation\u201d mantle to the \u201cfriends\u201d.</p> <p>Dowie herself followed no faith, although she did explore the thoughts and sayings of the Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba \u2013 ultimately rejecting his belief that he was the Avatar, God in human form.</p> <p>Born in Carlisle, Cumbria, Freda was the daughter of Emily (nee Davidson) and John Dowie, who sold fried fish. At Barrow girls\u2019 grammar school she passed her higher school certificate at 18, excelling in French, German and Latin, as well as English literature. After training at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London she worked as an acting coach and became principal of the North West School of Speech and Drama in Southport, Merseyside, also adjudicating at local festivals and school competitions.</p> <p>In 1958 she switched to acting, and began performing in repertory theatres. Within a few years her talent was recognised by the Royal Shakespeare Company, whose experimental group cast her as Mug in Boris Vian\u2019s play The Empire Builders at the New Arts theatre club, London, in 1962. Two years later she appeared alongside Glenda Jackson in the same group\u2019s Theatre of Cruelty season at the Lamda theatre club in London, under the director Peter Brook. Dowie also acted in a string of Greek tragedies, notably with a moving performance in the title role of Electra, alongside Derek Jacobi\u2019s Orestes, at the Greenwich theatre (1971). At the same venue a year later she played Queen Victoria in Brunel.</p> <p>Her 50-year television career, beginning in 1959, included parts as Princess Marie in War and Peace (1963), Fanny Thornton in North and South (1966), the Mother Superior helping at a refuge for vagrants and alcoholics in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/may/15/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Jeremy Sandford</a>\u2019s play Edna, the Inebriate Woman (1971), Miss Branwell in The Bront\u00ebs of Haworth (1973), the dual role of The Sybil and Caesonia in I Claudius (1976), Sally Brass in The Old Curiosity Shop (1980), Rachel Wardle in The Pickwick Papers (1985), Maria Insull in Sophia and Constance (1988), Mrs Waule in Middlemarch (1994) and Dulcie Green in Common as Muck (1994 and 1997).</p> <p>Dowie\u2019s rare big-screen roles included nuns in the horror films The Omen (1976) and The Monk (1990).

In Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit (1989), based on Jeanette Winterson\u2019s autobiographical novel about Jess, a girl growing up in a Pentecostal household in Lancashire and coming to understand her sexuality, she played Mrs Green, a fellow church member of the girl\u2019s controlling mother (Geraldine McEwan). Mrs Green\u2019s piety is questioned when her mood changes from devout and glum to appearing to revel in holding a wine glass to a wall to eavesdrop on a \u201cfornicating\u201d couple. Later Dowie appeared in Our Friends in the North (1996), Peter Flannery\u2019s epic nine-part drama paralleling four Newcastle friends\u2019 emotional upheavals over more than 30 years. She brought a quiet dignity to the role of Florrie Hutchinson, stuck in the middle between the socialist idealism of her son Nicky (Christopher Eccleston) and the disillusionment of her trade unionist husband Felix (Peter Vaughan), a former Jarrow marcher. On finding a machine-gun under her son\u2019s bed, Florrie \u2013 another Catholic \u2013 goes to church to pray for his soul. She later shows fortitude as Felix battles Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 until she can cope no longer and allows him to move to a care home. In the final episode, set in 1995, Nicky returns from Italy for Florrie\u2019s funeral, which marks the transfer of the \u201colder generation\u201d mantle to the \u201cfriends\u201d. Dowie herself followed no faith, although she did explore the thoughts and sayings of the Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba \u2013 ultimately rejecting his belief that he was the Avatar, God in human form. Born in Carlisle, Cumbria, Freda was the daughter of Emily (nee Davidson) and John Dowie, who sold fried fish. At Barrow girls\u2019 grammar school she passed her higher school certificate at 18, excelling in French, German and Latin, as well as English literature. After training at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London she worked as an acting coach and became principal of the North West School of Speech and Drama in Southport, Merseyside, also adjudicating at local festivals and school competitions. In 1958 she switched to acting, and began performing in repertory theatres. Within a few years her talent was recognised by the Royal Shakespeare Company, whose experimental group cast her as Mug in Boris Vian\u2019s play The Empire Builders at the New Arts theatre club, London, in 1962. Two years later she appeared alongside Glenda Jackson in the same group\u2019s Theatre of Cruelty season at the Lamda theatre club in London, under the director Peter Brook. Dowie also acted in a string of Greek tragedies, notably with a moving performance in the title role of Electra, alongside Derek Jacobi\u2019s Orestes, at the Greenwich theatre (1971). At the same venue a year later she played Queen Victoria in Brunel. Her 50-year television career, beginning in 1959, included parts as Princess Marie in War and Peace (1963), Fanny Thornton in North and South (1966), the Mother Superior helping at a refuge for vagrants and alcoholics in Jeremy Sandford\u2019s play Edna, the Inebriate Woman (1971), Miss Branwell in The Bront\u00ebs of Haworth (1973), the dual role of The Sybil and Caesonia in I Claudius (1976), Sally Brass in The Old Curiosity Shop (1980), Rachel Wardle in The Pickwick Papers (1985), Maria Insull in Sophia and Constance (1988), Mrs Waule in Middlemarch (1994) and Dulcie Green in Common as Muck (1994 and 1997). Dowie\u2019s rare big-screen roles included nuns in the horror films The Omen (1976) and The Monk (1990). On BBC radio, as well as acting in dozens of plays she was a popular Morning Story and poetry reader and in 1960-61 played Aliss Oliver in the soap opera Mrs Dale\u2019s Diary. Her first two marriages, to Lionel Butterworth in 1952 and John Goodrich in 1961, ended in divorce. Her third husband, the artist, Times art critic and maker of arts documentaries David Thompson, whom she married in 1970, died in April this year. \u2022 Freda Mary Dowie, actor, born 22 July 1928; died 10 August 2019",

It could do this in two ways: by taking advantage of historically low interest rates to float green bonds \u2013 something the German government is planning \u2013 or by channelling money created by the process known as quantitative easing into environmental projects. Retrofitting homes so that energy does not leak out of badly insulated walls and roofs means lower energy bills and the prospect of well-paid, secure jobs in every part of the country \u2013 and would make public engagement with the climate crisis easier to sustain. \u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor",

Lucas said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for this country and parliament must prevent it in any way possible. Jeremy Corbyn has done the right thing by reaching out to colleagues and I welcome the fact that all the opposition parties in the House of Commons have accepted his invitation for discussions. I would urge all MPs who have been approached and who recognise the danger this country faces to join these talks with an open mind. We all need to put our country\u2019s future first.</p> <p>That means either pursuing legislative measures or a vote of no confidence in a Boris Johnson government which is showing every intention of driving this country off the edge of a cliff, and replacing it with a caretaker government which is committed to giving the people the right to decide on the Brexit deal. </p> <p>I am prepared to support Jeremy Corbyn as leader of this caretaker government, as should any MP who wants to stop a no-deal Brexit. But if he cannot gain the support of a sufficient number of colleagues across parliament, I hope he will be prepared to back another MP from his party, or another, who can. I will ask him again to make his position clear in our discussions next week.</p> <p>I will also continue to make the case that we need a people\u2019s vote before a general election, as the only certain way of ensuring that the British people have the final say on Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn has said that, as leader of the opposition, he should be the person to form government in the event of Boris Johnson losing a vote of no confidence.

And, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/08/22/brexiteer-tories-warn-boris-johnson-stripping-northern-ireland/\">as the Daily Telegraph (paywall) is reporting this morning</a>, even if Johnson were to find an alternative to the backstop acceptable to the EU, Tory Brexiters are telling him that that would not be enough to persuade them to vote for the withdrawal agreement because there are other aspects of it that they want to change.</p> <p><strong>David Davis</strong>, the former Brexit secretary, told the Telegraph\u2019s Brexit podcast that he had a whole shopping list of desired changes. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019d argue for contingency on the money. I\u2019d argue for tighter limits, timetable limits, sunset clauses on ECJ and things like that. I\u2019d have a small shopping list. </p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be a ridiculous one, but one I think that any serious European Parliament and any European Council that wants a deal could go with.</p> <p>If I were doing this for Boris, I would be insistent on is that they make the bill - the \u00a339bn, the second half of it - contingent on progress on the future economic partnership.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Sir Bill Cash </strong>told the paper:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You can\u2019t restore self-government as a cut and paste operation and I am sure they understand that - taking parts of the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>We will be governed for a number of years by the other 27 member states under the existing draft withdrawal agreement ... even with the backstop removed.</p> </blockquote> <p>None of these concerns are new.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has played down the prospect of an early breakthrough in talks with the EU intended to resolve the Brexit crisis, saying people \u201cshouldn\u2019t necessarily get their hopes up too soon\u201d. (See 3.36pm.) Johnson has been strongly criticised for describing refugees crossing the English channel in small boats as illegal migrants. \u201cIf you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant and I\u2019m afraid the law will treat you as such,\u201d he said. (See 4.29pm.) But the Lib Dem home affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine said his explanation of the legal position was wrong. She said: It is just plain wrong for Boris Johnson to label refugees crossing the Channel as \u2018illegal migrants\u2019. Quite apart from the dehumanising language, there is nothing illegal about seeking sanctuary in the UK, and it is shameful that we have a prime minister who says it is. We know that many of these people have fled persecution in Iran. For the prime minister to casually dismiss their rights to asylum with no evidence whatsoever is unlawful and inhumane. The way to stop these dangerous crossings is through an effective and compassionate response: investing in a stronger Border Force to stop the smugglers and traffickers, while ensuring safe, legal routes to sanctuary for those forced out of their home countries. MP Jared O\u2019Mara has been arrested on suspicion of fraud, according to multiple sources, the BBC is reporting. Johnson has expressed concern about the fires raging in the Amazon and called for international action to protect rainforests, as his government came under pressure from Jeremy Corbyn to take action against the Brazilian president. That\u2019s all from me for today. I\u2019m not in next week, but hopefully a colleague will be writing a blog on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Thanks for the comments. A reader has been in touch to say that Boris Johnson\u2019s comment about migrants, \u201cif you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant and I\u2019m afraid the law will treat you as such\u201d, is misleading. (See 3.44pm.) As this Full Fact briefing explains, the UN Refugee Convention says that people can legitimately make a claim for asylum in the UK even if they enter the country without legal authorisation. Boris Johnson posted this on Twitter about his breakfast with Prue Leith, after she was appointed to advise a government review looking at hospital food. Later, visiting Torbay Hospital in Devon, Johnson where he met staff and patients catering and hospital staff and patients and served a ham salad lunch to patient Wenona Pappin, 70, from Paignton. \u201cGood afternoon, this is your lunch, I\u2019m Boris,\u201d Johnson told her. \u201cIs that really what you want? You don\u2019t want fish and chips?\u201d Explaining why the review was needed, he said: We get too many complaints from patients about the quality of the food and I think it does affect their experience when they are in hospital. And sometimes it can be something as simple as not having hot toast, and having toast actually made on the wards, so one thing you want to deliver is hot buttered toast for the patients of this country. Boris Johnson has also told migrants not to cross the English Channel to get to the UK as \u201cwe will send you back\u201d. Speaking to reporters on his Devon visit, Johnson said: Clearly the most important thing is to stop them coming across from France so we are working very closely with the French authorities. The point I would just make to people thinking of making this journey - one, it is very hazardous, you may think the weather looks great but it\u2019s a very, very dangerous thing to do. The second thing is - we will send you back. The UK should not be regarded as a place where you could automatically come and break the law by seeking to arrive illegally. If you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant and I\u2019m afraid the law will treat you as such. As the Press Association reports, authorities were called to at least seven incidents on Thursday involving 94 people who were trying to cross the water from France to get to the UK. The wave of attempted crossings continued today - with UK authorities understood to have been called to the Kent coast near Lydd. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is due to discuss the situation with her French counterpart in the next few days. UPDATE: Johnson\u2019s explanation of the legal position is misleading. See 4.29pm for details. Boris Johnson has played down hopes of an early breakthrough in talks with the EU intended to resolve the Brexit crisis. In comments that suggest he thinks some of the reporting of what he achieved this week has been over-optimistic, he said that while the \u201cmood music\u201d when he visited Berlin and Paris was \u201cvery good\u201d, people \u201cshouldn\u2019t necessarily get their hopes up too soon\u201d. Speaking to reporters on a visit to Devon, he said: [Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron] could see that we want a deal, they can see the problems with the backstop. Clearly Angela Merkel thinks that the solutions can be found within 30 days - actually what she meant was if you can do it in two years you can certainly do it in 30 days. But I want to caution everybody, OK? Because this is not going to be a cinch, this is not going to be easy. We will have to work very hard to get this thing done ... We have to have an arrangement that allows the whole UK to come out of the EU and have frictionless trade at the border in Northern Ireland. There are lots of ways that we can make sure that happens. But to persuade our EU friends and partners, who are very, very, very hard over against it, will take some time ... I\u2019m afraid we will have to prepare to come out without an agreement and we can do that, we are very confident that we will be OK because we will have all sorts of preparations in place. We are making progress but I am just telling people not to hold their breath, because I have seen the way these Brussels negotiations work. Johnson said that it was \u201calways on the steps of the court, as it were, that the deal is done\u201d. He went on: I must urge people - we are going to be working very hard on this but they shouldn\u2019t necessarily get their hopes up too soon. My colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels has been checking out the Sun story flagged up earlier (see 11.23am) saying the EU is considering a compromise on the backstop. This is what she\u2019s found. Boris Johnson has said he strongly backs President Macron\u2019s call for the fires in the Amazon rainforest to be treated as an international crisis. On a visit to a hospital Johnson said: I passionately share the view of Emmanuel Macron, and one of the things I am going to be raising at the G7 is the horrific loss of habitats and species around the world. We are going through an extinction of diversity, of biodiversity across the planet, we are down to about 15,000 lions left in the wild, perhaps 3,000 tigers in India, the population of elephants has declined at about 8% a year. What we in the UK want to do is lead the world now in setting targets for the retention, the maintenance, and the improvement of habitat, and stop this terrible loss of biodiversity, so set targets for keeping the species that we inherited on this planet. Here is Macron\u2019s tweet on the topic from yesterday. Jake Berry, the minister for the Northern Powerhouse, told the World at One that Boris Johnson\u2019s trips to Berlin and Paris this week showed that the EU is \u201csoftening its stance\u201d on Brexit. Berry claimed: The government has refocused absolutely on no-deal planning, but it is really important that your listeners realise that that is not our preferred route. Of course, our new prime minister, Boris Johnson, was in Germany and Paris this week, and I thought we started to see a crack or a chink of light with Europe softening its stance. The common view amongst informed observers (see here for some examples) is that this is an over-optimistic interpretation of what Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron were saying. The Department for International Trade has posted this response to the Labour complaint about a tweet from its minister, Conor Burns. (See 9.56am.) And Burns himself has said this. Jeremy Corbyn has urged Boris Johnson to take a stand against the Brazilian government over its failure to protect the Amazon rainforest. In an interview with broadcasters, he said: [The Brazilian president Jair] Bolsonaro has allowed and indeed encouraged these fires to take place, to clear the forest in order that the land can then be used for actually very short term agriculture production and after that it becomes desert. That is what\u2019s happening to the rainforest. The rainforest is an international resource, it\u2019s a carbon sink that we all need and rely on. And so we, the Labour party, the shadow cabinet, have written to the prime minister to say: put all the pressure you can on President Bolsonaro to deal with this issue, and when you\u2019re at the G7 summit raise the issue because it is one of global concern. If the Amazon rainforest is destroyed, if the West African rainforest is destroyed, then actually we all suffer. We\u2019re in this together, we have to save this planet together. That means taking the climate emergency very seriously and speaking out on the international stage to those people that have it in their power to stop the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Here\u2019s a copy of the letter. Number 10 has said that Johnson is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about what is happening to the Amazon rainforests and that at the G7 summit he will be discussing what can be done to protect nature and tackle climate change. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, has urged Jeremy Corbyn to back another MP for leader of an interim government to stop a no-deal Brexit if he cannot become PM himself. She made the call in a statement ahead of the meeting Corbyn has organised for next week with other opposition MPs, and some Tories, to discuss how they can work together to block a no-deal Brexit. Lucas said: A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for this country and parliament must prevent it in any way possible. Jeremy Corbyn has done the right thing by reaching out to colleagues and I welcome the fact that all the opposition parties in the House of Commons have accepted his invitation for discussions. I would urge all MPs who have been approached and who recognise the danger this country faces to join these talks with an open mind. We all need to put our country\u2019s future first. That means either pursuing legislative measures or a vote of no confidence in a Boris Johnson government which is showing every intention of driving this country off the edge of a cliff, and replacing it with a caretaker government which is committed to giving the people the right to decide on the Brexit deal. I am prepared to support Jeremy Corbyn as leader of this caretaker government, as should any MP who wants to stop a no-deal Brexit. But if he cannot gain the support of a sufficient number of colleagues across parliament, I hope he will be prepared to back another MP from his party, or another, who can. I will ask him again to make his position clear in our discussions next week. I will also continue to make the case that we need a people\u2019s vote before a general election, as the only certain way of ensuring that the British people have the final say on Brexit. Corbyn has said that, as leader of the opposition, he should be the person to form government in the event of Boris Johnson losing a vote of no confidence. Corbyn has said that in those circumstances he would form \u201ca strictly time-limited temporary government\u201d which would aim to negotiate an extension to article 50 and then call a general election. From Sky\u2019s Ireland correspondent, Stephen Murphy There was one local council byelection yesterday. Britain Elects has the result. On a visit to a kid\u2019s lunch club in Wales Jeremy Corbyn will accuse the government of failing a whole generation of children. In a news release issued in advance, Corbyn highlights the recent report from the children\u2019s commissioner for England saying 210,000 young people are living in temporary accommodation, with thousands staying in converted shipping containers. He also cites figures showing that 30% of children in England are living in poverty and that poorer children are much more likely to get low grades in their GCSEs than their richer peers. In a statement in the news release Corbyn said: Working class children are still being held back while their wealthy peers get ahead. The next Labour government will take radical action to unlock the potential of every child, not just a lucky few. The Tories are failing a whole generation of children. A child growing up in a shipping container or a B&amp;B, or going to school hungry, cannot be expected to reach their full potential. The measure of our society is how we treat our most vulnerable. And who could be more vulnerable than a homeless child? We have a moral responsibility to end the scandal of child poverty and homelessness. Corbyn also cited a range of Labour policies that would help disadvantaged children, including free school meals for all primary school pupils, introducing a \u00a310 an hour living wage and ending the benefit freeze. But Plaid Cymru criticised Corbyn for using a trip to Wales to criticise the UK government for its policies on issues some of which are devolved, and under the control of the Labour-run Welsh government. Bethan Sayed, a Plaid member of the Welsh assembly, said: The press release issued by Labour to mark Mr Corbyn\u2019s visit \u2018to Wales\u2019 spoke of a report by the children\u2019s commissioner for England and plans that Mr Corbyn has for a UK Labour government. Much of what he has in mind is devolved, and so would have no effect in Wales. At best, Mr Corbyn is politically illiterate and simply doesn\u2019t understand how devolved government works. At worst, he is purposefully ignoring the fact that his own party \u2013 which runs the Welsh government \u2013 has run out of ideas and motivation to improve the lives of people in Wales. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. I\u2019ve already mentioned the Telegraph story about Brexiter Tories telling Boris Johnson that the backstop is not the only problem with the withdrawal agreement. (See 8.37am.) Here are some other interesting stories from the day\u2019s papers. The Telegraph (paywall) says the Brexit department has been ordered to \u201cturbocharge\u201d work on alternatives to the backstop. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit Secretary, and his officials will now be ordered to \u201cturbocharge\u201d work on how to find alternative arrangements to the Northern Ireland backstop. Their work is expected to focus on examining proposals in a 270-page report drawn up by Greg Hands, the former Tory minister, and Nicky Morgan, now the culture secretary. It is understood the officials will be asked to update David Frost, the prime minister\u2019s Europe adviser, on progress, as he plans to hold meetings with European countries next week, after the G7 meeting of world leaders. Greg Hands, the former minister and co-chair of the Alternative Arrangements Commission, says in an article in the Daily Mail that, although EU officials have dismissed the AAC\u2019s plans for an alternative to the backstop, others are more supportive - including Angela Merkel. In June, I presented a report on the issue to a gathering of German cabinet members and senior German entrepreneurs and industrialists who showed great interest in finding solutions to the backstop. Unlike the ideological technocrats in Brussels who have refused point blank to consider any way of getting around this seemingly intractable problem, politicians and business folk are more pragmatic \u2013 including Chancellor Merkel. She has been indicating her willingness to be more practical on Brexit for some time. Now it is clear that she is prepared to give serious consideration to well-thought-out and practical ways of getting rid of the backstop so we can achieve four key objectives: Leave the EU without remaining half-shackled to Brussels for ever; avoid establishing a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; protect the Good Friday peace agreement; and safeguard the economies and living standards of those on both sides of the Irish border. Nick Gutteridge in the Sun says EU diplomats are considering plans for a backstop compromise. A plan under consideration would see the scope of the backstop whittled down and largely confined to covering livestock, plus animal and plant products. The private discussions amongst diplomats in Brussels at still at an early stage, but still contrasts with the EU\u2019s public line that the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be reopened. An EU source told The Sun: \u201cThat\u2019s where Boris is already having success - at least we\u2019re thinking at the highest levels about alternatives\u201d. Under the compromise solution, Northern Ireland would mirror Brussels rules on animal and plant health to allow \u201cseamless\u201d trade in agricultural products. But in return Brussels would agree to take a \u201ccontrolled risk\u201d on all other goods crossing the border from the UK into Ireland. Goods would be tracked by a system of alternative arrangements championed by Brexiteers, such as trusted trader schemes. The EU would not apply tariffs to any goods crossing the border from Britain, including those falling outside the scope of regulatory alignment \u2013 a major \u201cconcession\u201d on their part, Brussels sources said. Tobias Buck in the Financial Times (paywall) says British newspapers claimed that Boris Johnson won a concession from Angela Merkel on the backstop are wrong. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, another think-tank, said there was a rich history of UK politicians and pundits drawing the wrong conclusions from remarks made by the German chancellor. \u201cThe British like to assume that Germany will solve their problems. [Former British prime minister] David Cameron made this mistake several times.\u201d Mr Cameron was accused by the opposition Labour party of relying far too much on Ms Merkel during his efforts to secure new EU membership terms for the UK before the 2016 Brexit referendum. Mr Grant said UK misunderstanding of Ms Merkel was partly \u201cbecause the British Eurosceptic class is very ignorant about the EU and how it works and what drives it. So they clutch at straws. They mistake Merkel because her tone is polite and moderate.\u201d Steven Swinford and Kate Devlin in the Times (paywall) say Tory remainers trying to stop a no-deal Brexit are planning to hold their own talks with Brussels. The rebels, who are described as the \u201cRemain alliance\u201d and are led by Philip Hammond, have been working on plans to push through legislation that will force Boris Johnson to request an extension of the article 50 process. However, Downing Street sources have pointed out that Brussels could simply reject any request for an extension, even if Mr Johnson is legally bound to ask for one. One Tory rebel said that the group would hold its own discussions with Brussels and European leaders about the length and terms of any proposed extension to ensure it was accepted. The MP said that Mr Hammond, the former chancellor, had retained an \u201cextensive\u201d list of contacts from his time in office, which included leaders and finance ministers from across the European Union. \u201cThe next step is likely to be something that seeks to direct the government to seek an extension,\u201d the MP said. \u201cThey will need to have an idea of what extension they should be asking Brussels for.\u201d Workers at a centre dealing with universal credit are to stage a two-day strike in a row over workloads and staffing levels, the Press Association reports. Members of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) at the office in Stockport, Greater Manchester, will walk out from August 27. More than 200 UC staff in Stockport will go on strike for two days next Tuesday in a row over workloads and staffing levels. The union said staffing at the centre has been in decline since the flagship benefit was introduced three years ago, but the Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP) said it is confident that staffing levels are sufficient, PA reports. The Office for National Statistics has released a report on population numbers this morning. It says that the population of the UK was 66.4m in mid 2018, that population growth is at its slowest level since 2004 and that, in 50 years\u2019 time, there will be an extra 8.2m people aged 65 and over living in the UK. Sarah Coates, from the ONS\u2019s centre for ageing and demography, said: In 2018, the UK population reached 66.4 million people and migration remained the main driver to population growth. The structure of the UK\u2019s population is changing: people living longer and having fewer children means the age structure is shifting towards later ages. The ways in which people live are also changing with cohabiting families the fastest-growing family type and more young adults living with their parents. From YouGov Labour has criticised the international trade minister, Conor Burns, for this tweet he posted while on an official visit to Brazil. In it Burns describes the Brazilian trade minister Marcos Troyjo as \u201csuperb\u201d. But Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said Burns should not be \u201ccosying up to\u201d Troyjo because he has defended the Brazilian government\u2019s deforestation policies. Gardiner said: While [Brazilian president Jair] Bolsonaro lets agribusinesses burn the Amazon, this week a UK government minister has been busy cosying up to the Brazilian president\u2019s officials. Instead of posing for photographs with far right Brazilian politicians, Ministers should be calling on Brazil to do everything they can to protect the rainforest. The government must insist that Brazil honours environmental clauses in existing trade agreements and fulfils their commitments under the Paris agreement. Here is my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels on the Telegraph story. (See 8.37am.) This is what the Press Association has filed on the government plans to improve hospital food. Great British Bake Off judge Prue Leith is to advise a government review into hospital food following the deaths of six people due to a listeria outbreak. A \u201croot and branch\u201d review launched by the Department of Health and Social Care will examine whether the number of hospitals catering in-house can be increased. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called for the comprehensive review in June after six people died after contracting listeria from pre-packaged sandwiches and salads either purchased on site or given out by hospital staff. The review will also consider whether kitchen facilities can be changed to bring more chefs into hospitals as well as using less frozen food and sourcing local fresh produce where possible. Celebrity cook Leith has previously criticised the current standard of hospital meals and called for NHS trusts to make appealing and nutritious food on-site for patients. And this is what Leith is saying about her appointment. Millions of pounds are wasted in hospitals with food ending up in the bin, unpalatable food being the main complaint. I\u2019m delighted that, at long last, Downing Street and the Department of Health have decided to do something about it. A hospital meal should be a small highlight, a little pleasure and comfort, and it should help, not hinder, the patient\u2019s recovery. Boris Johnson is back in the UK after his trips to Berlin and Paris. Despite the attempts of some in the media to suggest that he has achieved some sort of breakthrough (take a look at the Daily Express splash here - and then compare it with the Guardian\u2019s take here, which of course is much more reliable), a solution to the Brexit crisis seems no closer than ever. And, as the Daily Telegraph (paywall) is reporting this morning, even if Johnson were to find an alternative to the backstop acceptable to the EU, Tory Brexiters are telling him that that would not be enough to persuade them to vote for the withdrawal agreement because there are other aspects of it that they want to change. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, told the Telegraph\u2019s Brexit podcast that he had a whole shopping list of desired changes. He said: I\u2019d argue for contingency on the money. I\u2019d argue for tighter limits, timetable limits, sunset clauses on ECJ and things like that. I\u2019d have a small shopping list. It wouldn\u2019t be a ridiculous one, but one I think that any serious European Parliament and any European Council that wants a deal could go with. If I were doing this for Boris, I would be insistent on is that they make the bill - the \u00a339bn, the second half of it - contingent on progress on the future economic partnership. And Sir Bill Cash told the paper: You can\u2019t restore self-government as a cut and paste operation and I am sure they understand that - taking parts of the withdrawal agreement. We will be governed for a number of years by the other 27 member states under the existing draft withdrawal agreement ... even with the backstop removed. None of these concerns are new. But it is worth flagging them up as a reminder that the backstop is not the only factor that makes the withdrawal agreement unacceptable to many Brexiter Tories. It looks relatively quiet today, although Jeremy Corbyn will be in Wales promoting Labour plans to help disadvantaged children, and Boris Johnson is doing a hospital visit to promote government plans to improve the quality of hospital food. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

The children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, criticised them as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/21/homeless-children-put-up-in-shipping-containers-report-says\">unsuitable and unsafe</a>. They were cramped, with nowhere to play or do homework, stiflingly hot in summer, and too cold in winter. That youngsters were growing up in them, she said, proved that \u201csomething has gone very wrong with our housing system\u201d.</p> <p>The housing charity Shelter weighed in, saying housing families in unsuitable converted shipping containers for months at a time was a \u201csad reflection\u201d of the housing crisis.

      "bodyText": "Eye-catchingly, Ikea-ishly modern with its brightly coloured exterior panelling glinting in the morning sun, Meath Court, a prefabricated apartment block in Ealing, west London, built from converted shipping containers, looks for all the world like a stylishly contemporary answer to the UK\u2019s growing homelessness problem. Cheap, quick to build \u2013 it went up in a miraculous 24 weeks on a plot of unused council-owned land \u2013 Meath Court hosts 60 households needing emergency housing. According to Ealing council the flats, which have been up and running for over 18 months, offer \u201ca stable, private environment for homeless families with nowhere else to go\u201d. There are others like it in Ealing, as well as Brighton and Bristol. This week, however, container flats started to look a little less ingenious. The children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, criticised them as unsuitable and unsafe. They were cramped, with nowhere to play or do homework, stiflingly hot in summer, and too cold in winter. That youngsters were growing up in them, she said, proved that \u201csomething has gone very wrong with our housing system\u201d. The housing charity Shelter weighed in, saying housing families in unsuitable converted shipping containers for months at a time was a \u201csad reflection\u201d of the housing crisis. Poor temporary housing, said the Children\u2019s Society, left youngsters feeling unsafe and anxious, and risked damaging their health and psychological wellbeing. But what is the truth about container flats? Christine, 28, (not her real name) has lived in Meath Court with her young son for nearly a year. \u201cWhen you first come here it is a bit daunting.\u201d But her experience has not been traumatic. \u201cI know people want to talk bad about it. I am not saying I want to live here forever because really I don\u2019t. But for the circumstances and choice it is not bad.\u201d It is far from perfect, she admits. The lack of space is a problem. Getting around the kitchen and living room, no wider than the width of a lorry, is a constant, shuffling pirouette of tidying and avoiding. The tiny sofa is a little more than an arm\u2019s length from the TV which sits awkwardly below eye-level on the floor (nothing can be bolted to the walls). In the bedroom, her son\u2019s raised bunk lies lengthways down one wall, covering the bottom half of Christine\u2019s bed. Storage for clothes and toys, she says with a smile, is \u201cnot ideal\u201d. But she is cheerily adamant it could be worse, and she is not worried about it restricting her active toddler son\u2019s development \u201calthough it would be nice to have a big train track in the house like normal kids\u201d. Heat in the metal containers is a major issue, says Christine. When the temperature hit 34C a few weeks ago, she says they could hardly breathe in the upper floor apartment. She ended up sleeping with her son outside on the walkway. Once she left the window open to try to cool the apartment during the day, but an unexpected shower left puddles of water on her bed and floors. The factory-converted containers are neat and modish, from the tiny kitchen unit to the wood-effect floors. The interior walls are encased in white plastic panels. The heater works \u2013 it never gets too cold in winter, Christine says. Even their critics admit container flats are superior to the often squalid B&amp;B rooms that constitute much emergency homelessness accommodation.

It is not that converted shipping containers are intrinsically unlivable. But they can struggle to cope with the reality of family homelessness. Another Meath Court tenant, Piotr, shows how almost every surface of his flat is piled high with clothes and toys. Residents have often been evicted from larger homes, and bring with them belongings from that more spacious former existence. Although the flats were designed as \u201cemergency accommodation\u201d, Piotr has been in Meath Court for 18 months, with no end in sight. Christine was told she would be here for just two months. The scarcity of move-on family homes means there is a danger the flats become just another slightly inadequate form of temporary accommodation. \u201cThey just dump you and leave you here,\u201d says Christine. Built in partnership with a private developer, Meath Court cost around \u00a335,000 per one-bed apartment \u2013 but they are not let at social housing rates. Christine\u2019s rent \u2013 for now covered by housing benefit \u2013 is \u00a3270 a week, which is close to local private market rents. A homeless tenant with two young children at another Ealing container development was evicted by the council for falling behind on the rent.

Once the full circumstances are established, the officer will be subject to appropriate management action. \u201cThe officer will be closely supervised and any further suggestion of non-impartiality will result in them playing no further part in this year\u2019s operation.\u201d The video, which captured 14 hours of footage from inside a farmyard building, also appeared to show ammunition being taken from a box on a table. The spokesperson added: \u201cWe have been made aware of allegations and footage relating to the security of ammunition at a badger cull briefing in north Devon. Police inquiries remain ongoing at this time and any identified criminal offences will be dealt with robustly.\u201d Jay Tiernan, a spokesperson for Stop the Cull, welcomed the apology and called for all future meetings to be recorded and published \u201cso the general public can see exactly how evenhanded badger cull policing is\u201d. \u201cThe police have once again shown they are in no way impartial when it comes to dealing with protesters,\u201d he said. \u201cA police officer calling all protesters \u2018idiots\u2019 is at the very least insensitive and it was compounded by his further comment that he might have \u2018trouble keeping my hands to myself\u2019. We are wholly engaged in non-violent direct action and there are no situations where a police officer should be considering violence towards us. \u201cHis comments that any of our trail cams found pointing at traps won\u2019t be returned to us are staggering, considering that video evidence is vital to prove criminal activity.\u201d Activists have been taking direct action in the countryside to prevent the killing of badgers, which they say is cruel and unnecessary. The government adviser who led the scientific review on which the policy was based, Prof Lord John Krebs, has said the cull is not an effective way of controlling bovine TB. However, the government has said the culls have resulted in disease reduction benefits for cattle.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>What is happening in the Amazon?</strong></h2> \n<p>Thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/23/amazon-fires-global-leaders-urged-divert-brazil-suicide-path\">fires are burning</a> in Brazil, many of them in the world\u2019s biggest rainforest, which is sending clouds of smoke across the region and pumping alarming quantities of carbon into the world\u2019s atmosphere.</p> \n<h2><strong>Does this happen every year?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes, but some areas have suffered far more than usual. In the worst-affected Brazilian state of Amazonas, the peak day this month was 700% higher than the average for the same date over the past 15 years. In other states, the amount of ash and other particulates in August has hit the highest level since 2010.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/amazon_fires_new/giv-39027MNnHFuysrHS/\" data-alt=\"Amazon map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/amazon_fires_new/giv-39027MNnHFuysrHS/\">Amazon map</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>What is the cause?</strong></h2> \n<p>Most of the fires are agricultural, either smallholders burning stubble after harvest, or farmers clearing forest for cropland. Illegal land-grabbers also destroy trees so they can raise the value of the property they seize. But they are manmade and mostly deliberate. Unlike the huge recent blazes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/31/putin-sends-military-fight-siberia-forest-fires-russia\">Siberia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/aug/23/there-is-no-silver-lining-why-alaska-fires-are-a-glimpse-of-our-climate-future\">Alaska</a>, the Amazon fires are very unlikely to have been caused by lightning.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is the entire forest ablaze?</strong></h2> \n<p>No. Satellite monitoring experts say the images of an entire forest ablaze are exaggerated. A great deal of misinformation has been spread by social media, including the use of <a href=\"https://factcheck.afp.com/prayforamazonas-thousands-people-are-sharing-old-pictures-posts-about-amazon-rainforest-fires\">striking images from previous years\u2019 burning seasons</a>. This week, there are more large fires in Colombia and eastern Brazil than in the Amazon. Most of the agricultural burn-offs are in deforested areas. But there are also fires in protected reserves.</p> \n<h2><strong>Do we need to worry about oxygen?</strong></h2> \n<p>No. Although some reports have claimed the Amazon produces 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen, it is not clear where this figure originated. The true figure is likely to be no more than 6%, according to climate scientists such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelEMann/status/1164899653525151745\">Michael Mann</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlobalEcoGuy/status/1164732075301146624\">Jonathan Foley</a>. Even if it were accurate, the crops being planted in the cleared forest areas would also produce oxygen \u2013 quite likely at higher levels. So although the burning of the rainforest is worrying for many reasons, there is no need to worry about an oxygen shortage.</p> \n<h2><strong>So should we still be concerned?</strong></h2> \n<p>Extremely. The fires are mostly illegal and they are degrading the world\u2019s biggest terrestrial carbon sink and most important home for biodiversity. They also contribute to a more important trend, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/brazil-amazon-rainforest-deforestation-environment\">an alarming rise</a> in deforestation. Scientists say the Amazon is approaching a tipping point, after which it will irreversibly degrade into a dry savannah. At a time when the world needs billions more trees to absorb carbon and stabilise the climate, the planet is losing its biggest rainforest.</p> \n<h2><strong>How much forest is being lost?</strong></h2> \n<p>In July, deforestation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/deforestation-of-brazilian-amazon-surges-to-record-high-bolsonaro\">spiked to a level</a> not seen in more than a decade. According to preliminary satellite data from Brazil\u2019s space agency, trees were being cleared at the rate of five football pitches every minute. Over the single month, 2,254 sq km (870 sq miles) were lost, a rise of 278% on the same month last year. Scientists say this year could be the first for 10 years in which 10,000 sq km of Amazon are lost.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-22T13:28:00/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Area lost - line chart\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-22T13:28:00/embed.html\">Area lost - line chart</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The situation was far worse in the 1990s and early 2000s. But Brazil won international kudos after that by slowing deforestation by 80% between 2005 and 2014. This was done with strict monitoring, better policing and stiffer penalties. But that system has been eroded in recent years and many fear a return to the alarming levels of forest loss that occurred two decades ago.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is this the fault of the Brazilian president</strong><strong>?</strong></h2> \n<p>Jair Bolsonaro has made things a lot worse by weakening the environment agency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/21/jair-bolsonaro-accuses-ngos-setting-fire-amazon-rainforest\">attacking conservation NGOs</a> and promoting the opening of the Amazon to mining, farming and logging. The far-right leader has dismissed satellite data on deforestation and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/02/brazil-space-institute-director-sacked-in-amazon-deforestation-row\">fired the head</a> of the space agency. But it is not solely his fault. The agricultural lobby is powerful in Brazil and it has steadily eroded the protection system that was so successful from 2005-2014. Deforestation crept up in the past five years under the previous presidents Dilma Rousseff and Michel Temer. The rate has accelerated rapidly in the first eight months of Bolsonaro\u2019s rule. But this is not just about him, politics or Brazil. There are also huge fires in Bolivia, which has a leftwing populist president.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/archive-zip/giv-3902wWGyVLczk6Og/\" data-alt=\"Scale of destruction \u2013 graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/archive-zip/giv-3902wWGyVLczk6Og/\">Scale of destruction \u2013 graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>What is the outside world doing?</strong></h2> \n<p>The UN secretary general and many world leaders and celebrities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/23/amazon-fires-global-leaders-urged-divert-brazil-suicide-path\">have expressed concern</a>. The Amazon will be high on the agenda for G7 leaders at a summit in France this weekend. They are likely to make a strong statement condemning the recent increase in deforestation and urge Brazil to restore the Amazon protections that previously made the country a global environmental leader.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is that enough?</strong></h2> \n<p>No. The priority should be building a buffer against the tipping point and drawing down emissions, which means not just protection of the Amazon but massive reforestation. This will require far more financial support than anything seen until now. For this to be effective, governments will also need to align their environment and trade policies. Currently countries like the UK spend small sums on overseas conservation, then promote billions of dollars worth of trade in beef, soy, timber, minerals and other products that undermine Amazon protection efforts. Politicians should also listen more to the voices of the people who live in the forest, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/28/amazon-gold-miners-invade-indigenous-village-brazil-leader-killed\">indigenous groups</a> and riverine communities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5444d786-7ca6-4ade-bd48-bca210f886c6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/upU1hlPXBpY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>What can individuals do?</strong></h2> \n<p>The most important actions are political and collective. Join a party or campaign group that makes the Amazon a priority. Through these groups, urge your elected representatives to block trade deals with countries that destroy their forests and to provide more support for countries that expand tree cover.</p> \n<p>Apart from this, donate to organisations that support the forest, forest dwellers and biodiversity, including <a href=\"https://www.socioambiental.org/pt-br\">Instituto Socioambiental</a>, <a href=\"https://amazonwatch.org/\">Amazon Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/\">WWF</a>, <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace</a>, <a href=\"https://imazon.org.br/en/\">Imazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.internationalrivers.org/\">International Rivers</a> and <a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a>.</p> \n<p>As consumers, think twice before buying Brazilian beef or other products unless certified by groups such as <a href=\"https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/\">Rainforest Alliance</a>.

      "bodyText": "What is happening in the Amazon? Thousands of fires are burning in Brazil, many of them in the world\u2019s biggest rainforest, which is sending clouds of smoke across the region and pumping alarming quantities of carbon into the world\u2019s atmosphere. Does this happen every year? Yes, but some areas have suffered far more than usual. In the worst-affected Brazilian state of Amazonas, the peak day this month was 700% higher than the average for the same date over the past 15 years. In other states, the amount of ash and other particulates in August has hit the highest level since 2010. What is the cause? Most of the fires are agricultural, either smallholders burning stubble after harvest, or farmers clearing forest for cropland. Illegal land-grabbers also destroy trees so they can raise the value of the property they seize. But they are manmade and mostly deliberate. Unlike the huge recent blazes in Siberia and Alaska, the Amazon fires are very unlikely to have been caused by lightning. Is the entire forest ablaze? No. Satellite monitoring experts say the images of an entire forest ablaze are exaggerated. A great deal of misinformation has been spread by social media, including the use of striking images from previous years\u2019 burning seasons. This week, there are more large fires in Colombia and eastern Brazil than in the Amazon. Most of the agricultural burn-offs are in deforested areas. But there are also fires in protected reserves. Do we need to worry about oxygen? No. Although some reports have claimed the Amazon produces 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen, it is not clear where this figure originated. The true figure is likely to be no more than 6%, according to climate scientists such as Michael Mann and Jonathan Foley. Even if it were accurate, the crops being planted in the cleared forest areas would also produce oxygen \u2013 quite likely at higher levels. So although the burning of the rainforest is worrying for many reasons, there is no need to worry about an oxygen shortage. So should we still be concerned? Extremely. The fires are mostly illegal and they are degrading the world\u2019s biggest terrestrial carbon sink and most important home for biodiversity. They also contribute to a more important trend, which is an alarming rise in deforestation. Scientists say the Amazon is approaching a tipping point, after which it will irreversibly degrade into a dry savannah. At a time when the world needs billions more trees to absorb carbon and stabilise the climate, the planet is losing its biggest rainforest. How much forest is being lost? In July, deforestation spiked to a level not seen in more than a decade. According to preliminary satellite data from Brazil\u2019s space agency, trees were being cleared at the rate of five football pitches every minute. Over the single month, 2,254 sq km (870 sq miles) were lost, a rise of 278% on the same month last year. Scientists say this year could be the first for 10 years in which 10,000 sq km of Amazon are lost. The situation was far worse in the 1990s and early 2000s. But Brazil won international kudos after that by slowing deforestation by 80% between 2005 and 2014. This was done with strict monitoring, better policing and stiffer penalties. But that system has been eroded in recent years and many fear a return to the alarming levels of forest loss that occurred two decades ago. Is this the fault of the Brazilian president? Jair Bolsonaro has made things a lot worse by weakening the environment agency, attacking conservation NGOs and promoting the opening of the Amazon to mining, farming and logging. The far-right leader has dismissed satellite data on deforestation and fired the head of the space agency. But it is not solely his fault. The agricultural lobby is powerful in Brazil and it has steadily eroded the protection system that was so successful from 2005-2014. Deforestation crept up in the past five years under the previous presidents Dilma Rousseff and Michel Temer. The rate has accelerated rapidly in the first eight months of Bolsonaro\u2019s rule. But this is not just about him, politics or Brazil. There are also huge fires in Bolivia, which has a leftwing populist president. What is the outside world doing? The UN secretary general and many world leaders and celebrities have expressed concern. The Amazon will be high on the agenda for G7 leaders at a summit in France this weekend. They are likely to make a strong statement condemning the recent increase in deforestation and urge Brazil to restore the Amazon protections that previously made the country a global environmental leader. Is that enough? No. The priority should be building a buffer against the tipping point and drawing down emissions, which means not just protection of the Amazon but massive reforestation. This will require far more financial support than anything seen until now. For this to be effective, governments will also need to align their environment and trade policies. Currently countries like the UK spend small sums on overseas conservation, then promote billions of dollars worth of trade in beef, soy, timber, minerals and other products that undermine Amazon protection efforts. Politicians should also listen more to the voices of the people who live in the forest, such as indigenous groups and riverine communities. What can individuals do? The most important actions are political and collective. Join a party or campaign group that makes the Amazon a priority. Through these groups, urge your elected representatives to block trade deals with countries that destroy their forests and to provide more support for countries that expand tree cover. Apart from this, donate to organisations that support the forest, forest dwellers and biodiversity, including Instituto Socioambiental, Amazon Watch, WWF, Greenpeace, Imazon, International Rivers and Friends of the Earth. As consumers, think twice before buying Brazilian beef or other products unless certified by groups such as Rainforest Alliance. The Amazon connection is not always obvious.",

      "bodyText": "What an eventful end to this bank holiday Friday. Here\u2019s a reminder of the global events we covered off today: The US toy company behind My Little Pony and Play-Doh has agreed to buy Peppa Pig for \u00a33.3bn in the the latest foreign takeover of a much-loved British brand for a bargain price following the collapse in the value of the pound over fears of a no-deal Brexit. The sale of Peppa Pig\u2019s owner Entertainment One to America\u2019s Hasbro brings the total value of UK companies to fall into overseas hands in the last two months to more than \u00a325bn China will impose tariffs on American exports worth about $75bn. China\u2019s ministry of commerce said it will impose levies of 5% and 10% on more than 5,000 products originating in the US, with crude oil, small aircraft and cars among the items targeted, Reuters reported. Some of the tariffs will take effect on 1 September, with the rest on 15 December Fed chair Jerome Powell spoke at the Jackson Hole Symposium, but the much-anticipated was overshadowed by fresh blows in the US-China trade war. The US central bank boss said the US economy was still performing well and pledged to remain \u201cvigilant\u201d around risks to financial stability. He also stressed that while trade uncertainty was weighing on global growth, foreign trade policies are ultimately outside of the Fed\u2019s remit Trump quickly hit out at Powell for saying \u201cnothing\u201d in his speech and compared the US Fed boss to China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping, asking which figure was a bigger enemy Not to be outdone by Beijing\u2019s fresh tariffs, Trump went on a Twitter tirade and ordered US companies to come home from China, sending US shares into the red Have a great long weekend. We\u2019ll be back on Tuesday. US stock markets are back in the red after Trump\u2019s tweets: S&amp;P 500 -0.69% Dow -0.56% Nasdaq Composite -0.82% Our colleague Dominic Rushe has full coverage of Powell\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole Not to be outdone by Beijing, Trump is now apparently ordering US companies to come home from China. He insists the US would be \u201cbetter off without\u201d China, full stop: Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank, says Powell\u2019s speech has a something for everyone: The war of words between the White House and Fed continues. And even if it\u2019s more subtlety worded on the Fed\u2019s side, analysts say Powell is holding his own: Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adds: Fed Chair Powell is rather more diplomatic in his language than the president - a low bar, admittedly - but it is clear from his speech that the single biggest factor driving both market volatility, the actual global slowdown, and fears of a U.S. slowdown, is trade policy, both its current stance and uncertainty about the future. After a long discussion of how the Fed arrived at its current policy framework, Mr. Powell stuck the knife in, pointing out that \u201cfitting trade policy uncertainty into this framework is a new challenge\u2026 [there are] no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation\u2026 Moreover, while monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment, and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade.\u201d In other words, the Fed has been handicapped by Mr. Trump\u2019s damaging and capricious trade policy, which has made it very hard for monetary policymakers to take a settled view of where the economy is headed. Donald Trump has come out swinging after Powell\u2019s speech failed to signal that it will bow to presidential pressure to cut interest rates further. The US Fed boss added that the July interest rate cut \u2013 which was the first in more than a decade \u2013 had eased financial conditions and helps explain why the US inflation outlook and employment \u201cremains largely favourable.\u201d But he lists a number of recent \u201cdevelopments\u201d that the Fed has kept an eye on, including (drumroll, please): The announcement of new US tariffs on imports from China Economic slowdown in Germany and China Growing possibility of a hard Brexit Rising tensions in Hong Kong Equity markets have been volatile. Long-term bond rates around the world have moved down sharply to near post-crisis lows. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has continued to perform well overall, driven by consumer spending. More highlights from Mr Powell\u2019s speech. He has hailed the strong performance of the US economy, at least on balance: The outlook for the US economy since the start of the year has continued to be a favourable one. Business investment and manufacturing have weakened, but solid job growth and rising wages have been driving robust consumption and supporting moderate growth overall. But he laments that the global growth outlook has been \u201cdeteriorating\u201d since mid-2018, mostly due to trade wobbles: Trade policy uncertainty seems to be playing a role in the global slowdown and in weak manufacturing and capital spending in the United States. Inflation fell below our objective at the start of the year. It appears to be moving back up closer to our symmetric 2% objective, but there are concerns about a more prolonged shortfall. Equity markets seem to have been soothed \u2013 if only slightly \u2013 by Powell\u2019s comments. The S&amp;P 500 is now just trading lower by around 0.16% compared to minus 0.43% earlier. The Dow is now flat, after trading lower by minus 0.36%. The Nasdaq is now down around 0.3% Powell alludes to Washington\u2019s trade war with China, saying the central bank is well aware of \u201ctrade policy uncertainty\u201d but is powerless to influence trade deals despite their affect on the US economy: Setting trade policy is the business of Congress and the Administration, not that of the Fed. Our assignment is to use monetary policy to foster our statutory goals. In principle, anything that affects the outlook for employment and inflation could also affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that could include uncertainty about trade policy. There are, however, no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation. Moreover, while monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade. We can, however, try to look through what may be passing events, focus on how trade developments are affecting the outlook, and adjust policy to promote our objectives. The Federal Reserve has released Jerome Powell\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole. Here are some highlights: The US economy continues to perform well, but he notes a sharp drop in global long-term bond rates and volatility across stock markets The risks to financial stability appear to be \u201cmoderate\u201d but Powell insists that \u201cwe remain vigilant\u201d He says the US economy is in a \u201cfavourable place\u201d and that the Federal Reserve will \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labour market and inflation near its symmetric 2% objective\u201d Hello, Kalyeena here, taking over to cover Mr Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole speech expected in less than 10 minutes\u2019 time. Meanwhile, we have the full story detailing China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on $75bn worth of US goods. Jerome Powell is shortly about to start speaking in the US \u2013 he starts at 8am Jackson Hole time, 3pm BST. Here\u2019s a quick guide on what to look out for. At issue are market expectations that the Federal Reserve is planning to cut rates multiple times in the next two years in response to slower growth. Market jitters have been heightened by the inversion of the US two-year/10-year yield curve, with yields on shorter-term debt above those on longer-term lending. That suggests that investors expect looser monetary policy in the near term as the central bank tries to prop up the slowing economy. Some other key points that Powell could address: Any mention of \u201cmid-cycle adjustments\u201d will likely be taken as a hawkish signal, suggesting that the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setters are not looking to cut as quickly as investors expect. Economic data since the last monetary policy meeting has worsened in some of the world\u2019s largest economies \u2013 and particularly in Germany\u2019s manufacturing powerhouse. The trade war has worsened notably since Powell last spoke in public \u2013 with another bad headline today. How Powell chooses to refer to that will be important. The White House has put immense pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut rates, rejecting decades of consensus on independence of the central bank. And with that, I will hand over to my colleague Kalyeena, who will take you through the speech itself. JJ Wall Street has fallen at the opening bell in the wake of the Chinese tariff announcement. The S&amp;P500 benchmark index lost 0.45%, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.56%. Donald Trump is awake, putting more pressure on Powell to cut rates. The next decision isn\u2019t due until 18 September, but it is pretty clear what the US president wants to see. Monetary policymakers like Powell have little room for manoeuvre when it comes to adjusting to shocks like the trade war, writes Nouriel Roubini, a professor of NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business and former White House adviser. Central bankers do not have the tools to deal with the trade war \u2013 and the associated geopolitical battle for supremacy in technology. It is easy to imagine how today\u2019s situation could lead to a full-scale implosion of the open global trading system. The question, then, is whether monetary and fiscal policymakers are prepared for a sustained \u2013 or even permanent \u2013 negative supply shock. Governments should gird themselves for \u201ccountercyclical fiscal easing to prevent the recession from becoming too severe\u201d if growth slows dramatically, he writes. You can read his column here: The timing of the announcement could barely be more difficult for Powell, who is due to speak in 90 minutes\u2019 time. The central bank chief will have carefully thought through his wording on the trade war, with Trump\u2019s White House breathing down his neck. He will have little time to think through adjustments this morning, despite it representing a major development adding to one of the biggest risk factors to the global economy. The tariffs will hit a large proportion of the goods not already covered in the trade war between China and the US. The Stoxx autos index, measuring the share prices of Europe\u2019s carmakers, has fallen by 1.8% after the revelation that cars will be in the crosshairs. As well as giving Jerome Powell a major headache, the tariff announcement has meant that European stock markets have made an abrupt u-turn. Germany\u2019s Dax, heavily dependent on exports, has fallen by 0.9% today, while the broader Stoxx 600, which looks across Europe, has lost 0.3%. The FTSE 100 is now down by 0.1%, after earlier rising. We have confirmation of the trade action hinted at by the Global Times editor earlier: China will impose tariffs on American exports worth about $75bn. China\u2019s ministry of commerce said it will impose levies of 5% and 10% on more than 5,000 products originating in the US, with crude oil, small aircraft and cars among the items targeted, Reuters reported. Some of the tariffs will take effect on 1 September, with the rest on 15 December. ...and for those who drink at lunch on a Friday, here\u2019s a great dispatch from the G7 in Biarritz, where a tariff on French wine could be in the offing after Emmanuel Macron targeted US tech firms with new levies. French wine-makers are increasingly concerned about Donald Trump\u2019s threats to introduce high tariffs on French wine in retaliation for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s tax on global technology giants, writes the Guardian\u2019s Angelique Chrisafis. Trump is a proud teetotaller, but he recently told reporters he had \u201calways liked American wines better than French wines even though I don\u2019t drink\u201d. He explained why: \u201cI just like the way they look.\u201d Perhaps you\u2019ve already had your lunch, but if not here\u2019s more to whet your appetite: the prospect of vegan doughnuts on a high street near you. Here\u2019s the full story on the Greggs revelation that it is working on even more vegan products: But here is a good illustration of the challenge facing Powell as he tries to balance supporting the economy with his desire not to raise rates prematurely: a strong suggestion that China is intending to retaliate to US tariffs. China will \u201ctake further countermeasures\u201d in the trade war, including retailiatory tariffs, after the US imposed levies on goods worth $300bn, according to Hu Xijin, the editor of China\u2019s Global Times, a state-controlled newspaper. The $300bn tariffs caused markets to panic at the start of the month, after the shock decision from Donald Trump, the US president. Ominous words from the Global Times: China has ammunition to fight back. The US side will feel the pain. There has also been some hawkish language from US rate-setters, which might suggest the Federal Reserve does not want to cut rates too quickly. More from Deutsche Bank: Fed officials already descended on Jackson Hole yesterday, and we got an interesting trickle of comments from some regional presidents. Overall, the tone was on the hawkish side of expectations. Kansas City\u2019s George said that she is not ready to provide more policy accommodation, Dallas\u2019s Kaplan said \u201cI\u2019d like to avoid having to take further action,\u201d and Philadelphia\u2019s Harker said \u201cI think we should stay here for a while and see how things play out.\u201d And yes, he was talking about interest rates, not the beautiful resort in Wyoming. Powell certainly appears to be getting into the swing of things at the Jackson Hole resort. Just look at those relaxed zip-off trousers from the central bank chief last night. Not sure what message that sends on monetary policy. Markets were this morning pricing in 57 basis points (0.5 percentage points) of cuts this year and another 47bps in 2020, meaning Powell has a high bar for markets to read a dovish message into today\u2019s comments. The last month has seen new trade war tensions, global growth slowdown fears and further steep drops in bond yields, so Powell\u2019s speech \u201ccouldn\u2019t come soon enough\u201d, said analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Craig Nicol. Recession concerns are \u201ccrystalising today\u201d, as evidenced by the inverted yield curve, Nicol said. The immediate focus of Powell\u2019s speech will likely be whether he affirms that the current easing is a \u2018mid-cycle adjustment\u2019 as per the FOMC minutes or align more closely to market pricing. The Deutsche Bank view is: If Powell sticks to the old language, as is most likely, it would affirm that he is still confident that the strength of consumption, in combination with modest Fed easing, will be sufficient to keep the recovery broadly on track. That would represent a slightly more hawkish message than markets are currently pricing, they reckon. So what will Powell do? In July the Federal Reserve chair described the interest rate cut as a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d of monetary policy, rather than the start of a proper cutting cycle. That comment could come back to haunt him if the US enters a recession \u2013 as markets are pricing \u2013 but in the short term investors will be keen to see whether he repeats this message. Lee Hardman and Fritz Louw, analysts at MUFG Bank, expect a stronger dollar after he speaks: We think he will likely stick with this theme, but highlight increased concern over the global economic outlook and the potential impact this could have on the US economy going forward. Even though we expect a dovish overall message from Chair Powell, it will likely fall short of the capitulation demanded by the market and US President Trump. The dollar will likely be supported on the back of this. As we approach midday in London, stock markets remain on the rise across Europe, with investors awaiting Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell in three hours\u2019 time. The FTSE 100 is up by 0.6%, while the FTSE 250 increased by 0.9%. The Stoxx 600 has also risen by 0.4%, but shed some of its earlier gains. Rising bond yields \u2013 as investors position for a slightly more hawkish message from Powell \u2013 have boosted the US dollar. Higher government bond yields generally suggest that investors expect tighter monetary policy, making the country\u2019s currency more attractive. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, has risen by 0.3% today. While central bankers are meeting at Jackson Hole, the leaders of the world\u2019s largest advanced economies have their own shindig: the G7 summit in Biarritz, in the south of France. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is there. Brexit is predictably on the agenda, for the British at least. You can follow the twists and turns today on the politics live blog. However, the start of the summit has been dominated by the reaction to wildfires in the Amazon. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, called for emergency talks on the subject at this week\u2019s G7 summit. Scientists have called for international pressure on Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has pursued a policy of developing the Amazon. Deforestation is thought to contribute directly to global heating. You can read more here: Huawei, the Chinese tech giant at the heart of the geopolitical dispute with the US, said on Friday its business has been less impacted by trade restrictions than initially feared. The $100bn company is \u201cfully prepared\u201d to live and work with US sanctions, it said. In June Huawei founder and chief executive Ren Zhengfei said US trade restrictions would dent revenue by $30bn this year. Eric Xu, Huawei\u2019s deputy chairman, was at a news conference earlier to introduce new artificial intelligence chips at its headquarters in Shenzhen. He said via Reuters: It seems it\u2019s going to be a little less than that. But you have to wait till our results in March. Washington said this week that it will extend by 90 days a reprieve that permits Huawei to buy from US firms in order to supply existing customers, but it also moved to add more than 40 of Huawei\u2019s units to its economic blacklist. Greggs is planning to roll out more vegan products, after the stunning marketing success of its vegan sausage roll. Chief executive Roger Whiteside said the company is looking at new products replacing meat with Quorn, in an interview with LBC radio station. Greggs sales topped \u00a31bn for the first time last year, and the launch of the vegan sausage roll at the start of the year helped it to buck the struggles of the high street. Whiteside said: We are working away at trying to see if we can come up with a vegan version of all our top-selling lines. Obviously people want a vegan option. If we can succeed in doing that and produce something that tastes just as good as the meat version, then that will sell very successfully. That\u2019s what\u2019s been shown with the vegan sausage roll. RBS and Santander may be smarting from the competition regulator\u2019s telling off this morning, but in a neat one-two punch the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has now criticised the claims management companies (CMCs) who have profited so immensely from the PPI scandal. The FCA on Friday said it has \u201cfound widespread poor-practice in CMCs\u201d using misleading adverts. CMCs make complaints on behalf of their customers \u2013 often taking fees as high as 30% of any compensation won. Regulators say they help people claim who otherwise would not be able. However, the FCA found a litany of abuses, including failing to tell users they can easily claim themselves, appearing to say customers would be better off using a CMC, and using misleadingly high compensation examples in adverts. New rules from the FCA require CMC firms to: identify themselves as a claims management company prominently state if a claim can be made to a statutory ombudsman / compensation scheme without using a CMC and without incurring a fee include prominent information relating to fees and termination fees which the customer may have to pay if a firm uses the term \u2018no win, no fee\u2019 or a term with similar meaning The regulator took over regulation of CMCs on 1 April 2019, after the previous regulator was widely criticised as toothless. While the PPI deadline on 29 August will deprive CMCs of a their most valuable income stream, the industry has moved on to other areas in its search for new revenue \u2013 notably in the payday loans sector. The Guardian previously reported an avalanche of spurious complaints from some firms. After something of a flurry of company news (particularly for a Friday in late August), here\u2019s a round-up of markets. The FTSE 100 is up by 0.7% to 7,180 points, boosted by the weaker pound. The mid-cap FTSE 250 is up by about 1% \u2013 boosted by Peppa Pig owner Entertainment One. Across Europe it was a sea of green, with all of the major indices gaining. Sterling has lost 0.4% against the US dollar, with one pound buying $1.2204. Against the euro the pound had lost 0.2%. The euro is down by 0.1% against the dollar, with the trade-weighted dollar basket up by 0.2% as investors await a speech by Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell. And news from Harland and Wolff, the shipbuilder whose yellow cranes dominate the Belfast skyline: administrators have extended a temporary lay-off period to give more time to find a buyer. The historic Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic fell into administration at the start of the month, threatening the end of centuries of shipbuilding in the city. BDO NI, the administrators, have extended the unpaid temporary lay-off position to 30 September to try to find a buyer, the company said in a statement on Friday. The company has received a \u201chealthy level of interest\u201d from potential purchasers who could preserve the existing jobs. This has resulted in a number of non-binding offers for the business, assets &amp; employees on a going concern basis. There are also other interested parties who are in constructive discussions with the administrators which may result in further offers. An update from Ryanair, whose pilots are currently striking over pay and conditions: flights from British airports are operating as usual today, with no disruption to its schedule expected. A judge rejected an application on Wednesday for an injunction against the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), which would have forced pilots to return to work. Hong Kong is gripped by protests and the backlash by government, and the airport will likely be disrupted again this weekend \u2013 raising concerns of a recession hitting the city. Hong Kong is a free marketer\u2019s dream. The tiny island has a GDP bigger than many industrialised countries, low tax and abundant cheap labour, and is a world-class financial centre boasting a stock market with a total value of more than \u00a32.5tn, write the Guardian\u2019s Martin Farrer and Erin Hale in Hong Kong. No wonder then that the city\u2019s most powerful vested interests are showing signs of nerves after 11 weeks of street protests that have paralysed the city, prompting its biggest political crisis since the handover to China in 1997 and threatening to push it into recession. Even worse, some observers believe the standoff could destroy Hong Kong\u2019s cherished entrepot status and send it on a journey of no return into China\u2019s orbit. You can read more here: Hasbro, the US toymaker behind My Little Pony and Play-Doh, has snapped up the Peppa Pig owner Entertainment One in a \u00a33.3bn takeover. The deal, which sent Entertainment One\u2019s share price soaring by 30% in morning trading, marks the latest UK-listed company to be targeted by a foreign buyer since the dramatic weakening of the pound over fears of a no-deal Brexit. The deal, the biggest in Hasbro\u2019s history, is more than three times the amount ITV offered in an aborted takeover attempt three years ago. You can read more from the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney here: Here\u2019s a chart that tells a story: shares in Woodford Patient Capital Trust since 2015. The shares are down by 6% today, to 41p, but earlier hit an all-time low of 38.1p \u2013 a far cry from levels above 90p at the start of the year, before the investor stampede to the exit from Woodford\u2019s investments. If you take a look at the list of troubled Eddie Stobart Logistics\u2019 biggest shareholders, one stands out: Woodford Investment Management. Woodford, run by prominent but by now bedraggled investement manager Neil Woodford, owns 23% of Eddie Stobart, whose shares have now been suspended. When it rains, it pours. Investors are currently blocked from withdrawing money from his equity income fund, but shares in the listed Woodford Patient Capital Trust today hit a record low after a separate announcement that it must reduce the valuation of its stake in IH Holdings International Limited. That is the parent company of Industrial Heat, a North Carolina company trying to use \u201clow-energy nuclear reactions\u201d as an energy source. The FT described Industrial Heat\u2019s central idea (\u00a3) as \u201con the fringes of modern physics\u201d. Woodford Patient Capital Trust\u2019s statement said: The valuation adjustment reflects a reassessment of the current progress of the business. Sterling went on a bit of a tear yesterday as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, appeared to strike an emollient Brexit tone. It gained 1% yesterday, but is back down 0.4% today. France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron perhaps reminded traders last night that, to coin a phrase, nothing has changed on the UK\u2019s departure from the EU so far. The FTSE 100 is up by 0.5% in early trading \u2013 in part thanks to the weakness of the pound, which has lost 0.4% this morning against the US dollar. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40 indices are both up by 0.5% as well. Eddie Stobart Logistics has said chief executive Alex Laffey will step down immediately as the company applied to suspend its shares from trading after it failed to publish its half-year results in time. The company, which provides transportation and warehousing facilities, found errors in its previous financial statements in a review a month ago. Eddie Stobart said on Friday it would publish the results in early September and announced a review of its dividend policy. It said Laffey will be replaced by Sebastien Desreumaux, the head of its iForce unit. In a statement, Stobart said it need to apply \u201ca more prudent approach to revenue recognition, re-assessing the recoverability of certain receivables, as well as considering the appropriateness of certain provisions\u201d. While revenue expectations for the first half are broadly in line with previous guidance, the full impact of these items on adjusted EBIT is unclear, but it is likely to be significantly lower than anticipated at the time of the half year trading update on 9 July 2019. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK\u2019s competition regulator has ordered Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander to appoint an independent body to audit their PPI processes after they failed to tell thousands of customers about their policies. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), led by former Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, said RBS and Santander failed to provide required accurate reminders of their payment protection insurance (PPI) policies to 11,000 and 3,400 customers respectively. The failures took place over six and five years respectively. The PPI scandal, in which banks systematically missold insurance to customers with little likelihood of it ever being used, has been a millstone around the necks of the banks. New City Agenda, a think tank, calculates that the bill for the British banking sector has reached \u00a348.5bn \u2013 and it could breach \u00a350bn. The banks were meant to send customers an annual reminder from their PPI provider that clearly sets out how much they\u2019ve paid for their policy, the type of cover they have, and reminds them of their right to cancel. RBS failed to send reminders, and will have to refund customers another \u00a31.5m, while Santander sent inaccurate information. Adam Land, a senior director at the CMA, said: It is unacceptable that some banks aren\u2019t providing PPI reminders \u2013 or are sending inaccurate ones \u2013 eight years after our order came into force. The legally binding directions we\u2019ve issued today will make sure that both RBS and Santander now play by the rules. These are serious issues that, in the future, may result in fines if the government gives us the powers we\u2019ve asked for. For now, we expect RBS to repay all affected customers quickly, and for both RBS and Santander to make sure that similar breaches do not happen again. The final deadline for new PPI claims is 29 August, with the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, currently carrying out an Arnold Schwarzenegger-themed advertising campaign \u2013 yes, really \u2013 to remind people to claim. It is yet another reputational blow to the banks in the scandal which will not die. Meanwhile, in Jackson Hole... We\u2019re well into sleepy August on the economic data front, with no really notable releases. Those economists who aren\u2019t on the beach (and probably some who are, given its importance this year) will be tuning into coverage of Jackson Hole, the annual central bankers\u2019 holiday retreat in the Wyoming countryside. Who would take the job of Jerome Powell right now? Every Federal Reserve chair has to put up with their fair share of brickbats, but nobody for the best part of a century has had to take such furious criticism from the White House. Powell will have a chance to hit back later today \u2013 or at least to lay out his reasons for resisting Trump\u2019s calls to cut rates to stimulate the economy. He speaks at the central bankers\u2019 summer retreat in Jackson Hole, hosted by the Kansas City Fed, at 3pm BST. You can see the full schedule here \u2013 Bank of England governor Mark Carney is due to speak at 8pm BST. But what to expect? After Powell delivered the first rate cut in a decade at the start of the month, investors are looking for signs of more to come as fears around a recession rise. On bond markets the US two-year/10-year yield curve inverted again yesterday, flashing another warning sign over the world\u2019s largest economy. China\u2019s renminbi hit its lowest point in more than 11 years against the US dollar in early trading, but currency moves have mostly been muted as traders await Powell\u2019s comments.",

In a tweet posted on Thursday, the close ally of Johnson described the Brazilian trade minister, Marcos Troyjo, as \u201csuperb\u201d during an official trade visit. He shook hands with counterparts in Brasilia on Wednesday and declared a desire to deepen relations. Asked about the wildfires, Burns reportedly said Bolsonaro\u2019s government had \u201clegitimate ambitions to bring prosperity to its people\u201d. A spokesperson later claimed the quote had been taken out of context and that Burns did discuss the UK\u2019s commitment to tackling the climate crisis in his interview. Burns\u2019s Twitter feed did not mention international fears and conservationists\u2019 concerns that Brazil\u2019s government was tacitly allowing, and could be actively encouraging, the devastation of the country\u2019s rainforest. Labour said Bolsonaro had encouraged the clearing of land by loggers and farmers and sped up deforestation. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said Burns should not be \u201ccosying up\u201d to Troyjo, since he has defended the Brazilian government\u2019s deforestation policies. \u201cWhile Bolsonaro lets agribusinesses burn the Amazon, this week a UK government minister has been busy cosying up to the Brazilian president\u2019s officials,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of posing for photographs with far-right Brazilian politicians, ministers should be calling on Brazil to do everything they can to protect the rainforest. The government must insist that Brazil honours environmental clauses in existing trade agreements and fulfils their commitments under the Paris agreement.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade said Burns had raised the environment in meetings in Brazil. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the increase in fires in the Amazon rainforest,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe UK remains committed to protecting the world\u2019s rainforests and will continue to do so in Brazil through our international climate finance programmes.\u201d Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised for attacking the country\u2019s environment agencies and declaring plans to open up indigenous reserves, some of the best protected in the Amazon, to mining. The fires \u2013 started illegally to clear and prepare land for crops, cattle and property speculation \u2013 have created giant clouds of smoke that have drifted hundreds of miles and prompted the state of Amazonas to declare an emergency. In the five days to Wednesday, there were 7,746 fires in Brazil, according to data from the country\u2019s National Institute for Space Research (INPE).

      "body": "<h2>IT DIDN\u2019T TAKE LONG TO GET HERE, THEN</h2> <p>It breaks the heart when kith and kin turn upon one another. So imagine the devastation on Tyneside as two Geordie legends go hammer and tongs, and on the eve of such a big game as well. Newcastle slink down to Spurs on Sunday but a chunk of Bernard Cribbins\u2019s precious prep time has been spent shouting down a man who could give lessons on how not to hold down the Toon\u2019s famed No 9 shirt. Michael Chopra (six years, 31 appearances, three goals) still has an \u201cin\u201d or two at the club that raised him and let slip earlier this week that he\u2019d heard worrying things. \u201c[Cribbins] has come in and some of the players don\u2019t know their jobs \u2013 they\u2019re not really working on their shape,\u201d he intoned \u2013 quite some concern when you\u2019ve just been dismantled by newly-promoted Norwich and shown an attitude that, according to the ex-Alloa and Kerala Blasters striker, \u201cwas disgusting\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/23/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ouch. Would Cribbins turn the other cheek given that, so far, Newcastle have looked less fun than a wet Saturday afternoon trailing around the Metrocentre? Would he outline a plan designed to stick it to Mauricio Pochettino and chums in their glitzy new stadium on Sunday? Not quite. \u201cThe Chopra thing,\u201d he began, with assembled hacks no doubt sitting back and drooling, \u201cwas blown out of all proportion \u2026 I\u2019m just surprised that people [pay] any attention to him. Some of this stuff is just fabricated and lies. When it\u2019s like that you think: \u2018Why is that making national headlines when it is total rubbish?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In fairness Newcastle\u2019s performances have thus far done that themselves. All Chopra has done is perpetuate the exhausting cycle of mistrust and self-loathing that has unsurprisingly survived the arrival of Cribbins, whose enlisting was a transparent move to tug at fans\u2019 heartstrings while Rafa Ben\u00edtez merrily boarded the next 737 to China. \u201cAfter two games, there\u2019s a so-called mini-crisis and all the rest of it and \u2026 that is over-sensationalised,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything seems to be that way. But look, I understand that, it\u2019s the nature of the club \u2013 it always has been. There\u2019s always a storm in Newcastle and at the minute, we\u2019re in one.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps they know no other way \u2013 it\u2019s just that this is a far cry from the up-and-down exuberance of, say, Kevin Keegan. And perhaps Cribbins\u2019s critics are right that, for the modicum of warm-heartedness his presence promotes, the solution won\u2019t be found on their own doorstep.

      "bodyText": "IT DIDN\u2019T TAKE LONG TO GET HERE, THEN It breaks the heart when kith and kin turn upon one another. So imagine the devastation on Tyneside as two Geordie legends go hammer and tongs, and on the eve of such a big game as well. Newcastle slink down to Spurs on Sunday but a chunk of Bernard Cribbins\u2019s precious prep time has been spent shouting down a man who could give lessons on how not to hold down the Toon\u2019s famed No 9 shirt. Michael Chopra (six years, 31 appearances, three goals) still has an \u201cin\u201d or two at the club that raised him and let slip earlier this week that he\u2019d heard worrying things. \u201c[Cribbins] has come in and some of the players don\u2019t know their jobs \u2013 they\u2019re not really working on their shape,\u201d he intoned \u2013 quite some concern when you\u2019ve just been dismantled by newly-promoted Norwich and shown an attitude that, according to the ex-Alloa and Kerala Blasters striker, \u201cwas disgusting\u201d. Ouch. Would Cribbins turn the other cheek given that, so far, Newcastle have looked less fun than a wet Saturday afternoon trailing around the Metrocentre? Would he outline a plan designed to stick it to Mauricio Pochettino and chums in their glitzy new stadium on Sunday? Not quite. \u201cThe Chopra thing,\u201d he began, with assembled hacks no doubt sitting back and drooling, \u201cwas blown out of all proportion \u2026 I\u2019m just surprised that people [pay] any attention to him. Some of this stuff is just fabricated and lies. When it\u2019s like that you think: \u2018Why is that making national headlines when it is total rubbish?\u2019\u201d In fairness Newcastle\u2019s performances have thus far done that themselves. All Chopra has done is perpetuate the exhausting cycle of mistrust and self-loathing that has unsurprisingly survived the arrival of Cribbins, whose enlisting was a transparent move to tug at fans\u2019 heartstrings while Rafa Ben\u00edtez merrily boarded the next 737 to China. \u201cAfter two games, there\u2019s a so-called mini-crisis and all the rest of it and \u2026 that is over-sensationalised,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything seems to be that way. But look, I understand that, it\u2019s the nature of the club \u2013 it always has been. There\u2019s always a storm in Newcastle and at the minute, we\u2019re in one.\u201d Perhaps they know no other way \u2013 it\u2019s just that this is a far cry from the up-and-down exuberance of, say, Kevin Keegan. And perhaps Cribbins\u2019s critics are right that, for the modicum of warm-heartedness his presence promotes, the solution won\u2019t be found on their own doorstep. Handily enough that\u2019s one sentiment with which Chopra, flogged unceremoniously to Cardiff City for \u00a3500,000 in 2006, might be particularly able to sympathise with. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Nick Ames for hot MBM coverage of Aston Villa 0-0 Everton from 8pm BST.

You may think the weather looks great but it\u2019s a very, very dangerous thing to do.</p> <p>\u201cThe second thing is: we will send you back.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has warned those thinking of crossing the Channel illegally that they will be sent back to France after dozens of people, including children, were intercepted on Thursday in several incidents at sea and on the south coast. The prime minister\u2019s comments came as the home secretary, Priti Patel, prepared to hold talks with her French counterpart about the crossings, which have sometimes been linked to fairer weather conditions. \u201cClearly the most important thing is to stop them coming across from France so we are working very closely with the French authorities,\u201d the prime minister said during a visit to Devon. \u201cThe point I would just make to people thinking of making this journey: one, it is very hazardous. You may think the weather looks great but it\u2019s a very, very dangerous thing to do. \u201cThe second thing is: we will send you back. The UK should not be regarded as a place where you could automatically come and break the law by seeking to arrive illegally. If you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant and I\u2019m afraid the law will treat you as such.\u201d Patel\u2019s predecessor as home secretary, Sajid Javid, declared a \u201cmajor incident\u201d after an increase in the number of people attempting the journey across the Channel at Christmas.

Dozens of people who were picked up at sea and on land by UK authorities on Thursday included 11 people, among them children, who were on two boats which landed at Winchelsea Beach, near Rye in East Sussex. But there was concern for the welfare of several other people, which Sussex police said could include a family with children and who may have left the beach. The chief inspector of Sussex police, Anita Turner, said: \u201cWe want to make sure that these people are safely ashore and that they are OK.\u201d A total of 53 people, including at least six children, were picked up in the Channel from a number of small boats while trying to reach the south coast of England on Thursday.

The claims were struck from the US court record by a judge who described them as \u201cimmaterial and impertinent\u201d.

That video, and a photograph of him walking with Epstein in New York\u2019s Central Park, were taken in 2010 \u2013 two years after the billionaire was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution and was a registered sex offender.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation changed when Epstein was convicted. It was [Andrew\u2019s] conscious decision to stay loyal, to not criticise his friend the convicted paedophile. And, while that may be fine for him, it\u2019s a step too far. What it\u2019s saying is the royal family tolerates this sort of behaviour,\u201d said one veteran royal commentator, who has met Andrew on several occasions, and believes he should now step down from his public roles.</p> <p>Time and again, Andrew, who a courtier once reportedly described as having \u201ca pompous level of self-importance\u201d, has demonstrated an eye-watering lack of judgment.

      "bodyText": "Randy Andy, Air Miles Andy, and now the Duke of Hazard: headline writers have always found evocative ways to shorthand the Queen\u2019s second son at different stages in his royal career. As the Duke of York, 59, is spotted teeing off at the Real Club Valderrama, the exclusive golf club in Sotogrande, southern Spain, coverage of his controversial former friendship with the disgraced billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein continues to make uncomfortable reading for Buckingham Palace. Once the pilot prince, photographed with a rose clamped between his teeth at a hero\u2019s homecoming following the Falklands war, his public image is now a disaster. The latest optics are grainy video of him at Epstein\u2019s New York mansion, amid reports of royal foot massages dispensed by young women. The duke, first named in US court documents in 2015, has issued outright denials over allegations he had sexual encounters in 2001 with Virginia Roberts, now Giuffre, when she was a 17 -year-old masseuse for Epstein. The claims were struck from the US court record by a judge who described them as \u201cimmaterial and impertinent\u201d. Also vehemently denied are allegations, in recently released court papers of the Guiffre case, made by Johanna Sjoberg that Andrew touched her breast while sitting on a couch at Epstein\u2019s home in 2001. When the video footage of Andrew waving off a young woman from the convicted sex offender\u2019s residence emerged this month, an equally strong statement, through Buckingham Palace, said the duke was \u201cappalled\u201d by the recent sexual abuse claims levelled at Epstein, 66, who killed himself in jail on 10 August while facing sex trafficking charges. \u201cHis Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent,\u201d it said. There can be no denial, however, about Andrew\u2019s crass lack of judgment. That video, and a photograph of him walking with Epstein in New York\u2019s Central Park, were taken in 2010 \u2013 two years after the billionaire was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution and was a registered sex offender. \u201cThe situation changed when Epstein was convicted. It was [Andrew\u2019s] conscious decision to stay loyal, to not criticise his friend the convicted paedophile. And, while that may be fine for him, it\u2019s a step too far. What it\u2019s saying is the royal family tolerates this sort of behaviour,\u201d said one veteran royal commentator, who has met Andrew on several occasions, and believes he should now step down from his public roles. Time and again, Andrew, who a courtier once reportedly described as having \u201ca pompous level of self-importance\u201d, has demonstrated an eye-watering lack of judgment. Palace staff have rated him the rudest of royals, according to reports. A secret cable, published on WikiLeaks in 2010, revealed a US ambassador describing Andrew speaking \u201ccockily\u201d during one official lunch, leading to a discussion that \u201cverged on the rude\u201d. He earned the soubriquet Air Miles Andy after the National Audit Office censured his helicopter habit in 2005, which included him spending \u00a332,000 in one year flying to Scotland to the Royal and Ancient club at St Andrews in his capacity as captain. In 2011, following pressure over the Epstein connection, he stood down from his role as UK special representative for trade and investment. It did not help when his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, admitted having accepted \u00a315,000 from Epstein to help pay off her debts. His links have often raised eyebrows; meetings with the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s son Saif; entertaining the son-in-law of Tunisia\u2019s ousted president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali at Buckingham Palace; his relations with Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of the then president of Kazakhstan, who purchased the duke\u2019s Sunninghill Park home for \u00a33m more than its \u00a312m asking price in 2007. \u201cRightly, or wrongly, there is a perceived air of arrogance about Andrew, and he is described by various people as boorish and very self-centred,\u201d said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine. \u201cPerhaps we shouldn\u2019t be judging the book by its cover. But, certainly, that\u2019s the impression he has given for a very long time.\u201d Andrew\u2019s loyalty to his seemingly perpetually broke former wife, famously photographed having her toes sucked by her \u201cfinancial adviser\u201d before their 1996 divorce, remains clear. The two live under the same roof, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, and are currently holidaying together in Sotogrande. Even after Ferguson was caught trying to sell access to her ex-husband to an undercover reporter for \u00a3500,000 \u2013 of which the duke denied any knowledge \u2013 they remain close. Andrew\u2019s friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the notorious press baron Robert Maxwell, and a close friend of Epstein\u2019s, first surfaced in 2000 when they appeared together at private parties and celebrity functions in the UK and US. Today he is patron of some 200 charities and organisations, and the Prince Andrew Charitable Trust supports young people, healthcare issues and the participation of the disabled and wounded service personnel in sporting activities. His Pitch@Palace initiative, which links tech entrepreneurs to people who can help their business, is his \u201cpassion project\u201d which he has taken global. Long-rumoured to be the Queen\u2019s favourite son, she has made her support clear. The day after Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail, Andrew was photographed beaming alongside his mother on the way to church in Crathie, near Balmoral.

The party line from the studio had to do with avoiding any association between the recent spate of public shootings and the human-on-human gun violence in the film; look closer, though, and one notices that the grassroots outcry urging against the release came mostly from conservatives offended by the notion of playing prey to the 1%\u2019s predators.</p> <p>The Korean festival sensation Parasite will soon reintroduce these ideas of righteous revenge taken on the moneyed by the impoverished when the film comes to US theaters in October. For now, however, we can find an equally dense meditation on similar themes in Jordan Peele\u2019s Us.

      "bodyText": "The thing about rich people is that they need the working poor much more than the working poor need them. The new horror film Ready or Not imagines a circumstance under which the upper crust will literally \u2013 instantaneously, violently \u2013 cease to exist without the regular sacrifice of the underclass. The Le Domas family, a detestable group of scions to a vast fortune built on a board game empire, keep up a peculiar tradition when one of their own gets married. Before an outsider will be permitted to join their ranks, they must first play a game, which happens to be a lethal round of hide-and-seek for the hardscrabble Grace (Samara Weaving). If she loses, she will be strapped to a ceremonial tablet and gutted like a trout in tribute to Satan. If she wins, the Le Domases are convinced they will all meet their demise, so the girl\u2019s got to go. In-laws, am I right? Not since 1989\u2019s Society envisioned the Beverly Hills elite as a clandestine murder-orgy cult has a mainstream horror release been as outwardly, nakedly contemptuous of the wealthy. But there\u2019s something in the air these days, with a handful of new movies evincing a deep and abiding distrust of the haves while portraying the have-nots in heroic terms. \u201cThings are getting crazier out there,\u201d mumbles Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Joker in the upcoming solo vehicle for the longtime Batman villain, another picture about a man with nothing ground down by the whims of one-percenters. It would appear that that atmosphere has also seeped into our multiplexes, too, as shoulder-chipped film-makers work out class resentments in the culturally sanctioned roleplay of the cinema. Even the faintest hint of friction between the blue and white collars was enough to get Universal to pull The Hunt, a satirical The Most Dangerous Game update pitting heartland types against millionaire poachers gunning for their hides. The party line from the studio had to do with avoiding any association between the recent spate of public shootings and the human-on-human gun violence in the film; look closer, though, and one notices that the grassroots outcry urging against the release came mostly from conservatives offended by the notion of playing prey to the 1%\u2019s predators. The Korean festival sensation Parasite will soon reintroduce these ideas of righteous revenge taken on the moneyed by the impoverished when the film comes to US theaters in October. For now, however, we can find an equally dense meditation on similar themes in Jordan Peele\u2019s Us. The smell of allegory emanates strongly from the fledgling auteur\u2019s sophomore feature, and while he invited viewers to gin up their own readings, the core concept pertains to the oppositional relationship between those above and below the poverty line.

      "body": "<p><strong>My son is two years old. He has recently started bullying (hitting and pushing) children his age. This was shortly after I </strong><strong>moved abroad to work while he stayed with my wife, his mother. He attends a nursery and other family gatherings, so </strong><strong>is not isolated socially in interacting with other people. I </strong><strong>keep almost daily video contact with him for a few minutes (as a child, he can\u2019t stand in front of a device for long</strong><strong>). He knows me, calls me and interacts with me. I have 10 days\u2019 leave</strong><strong> every </strong><strong>six to eight weeks which I plan to </strong><strong>use to</strong><strong> stay with my family, including my son. Do you have any advice for me and my wife on how to treat our son, and make him</strong><strong> feel</strong><strong> and act</strong><strong> better?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m really pleased you have made the connection between how your son feels and how he acts \u2013 many parents don\u2019t. I consulted Katy Dearnley, a consultant child psychotherapist who specialises in children under five. Each of us wondered about the chronology: did your departure and your son\u2019s starting nursery coincide? \u201cIf so,\u201d Dearnley said, \u201cthis would be a double separation for your son to deal with.\u201d On its own, your leaving is a big event for him to cope with.</p> <p>He\u2019s also two years old, the age at which children learn that they are separate entities from their parents (an essential stage of development). This can trigger certain behaviours. \u201cIt can arouse very strong concerns about being left out,\u201d Dearnley said. \u201cThis can be why toddlers who previously went to bed with no issues suddenly want to stay up.\u201d</p> <p>How was your departure handled? Sometimes parents slip away without an explanation, fearing a painful goodbye, or believing their children are too young to understand. \u201cNever disappear without saying goodbye, no matter how upset he may be,\u201d Dearnley said. \u201cComing to terms with the feelings that separation can cause is an essential part of growing up. Your son needs to be prepared not only for your departures, but also for when you come back. Children often believe that events are caused by something they have done, and your son will need to be reassured that your departure is nothing to do with him, and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s done anything wrong.\u201d Remember: children think the world revolves around them and therefore that they can make bad things happen.</p> <p>Dearnley also wanted to know more about the hitting and pushing: when it happens and if it only happens at nursery. If it\u2019s unprovoked, this would suggest some anxiety or distress in your son. \u201cTwo-year-olds are very instinctive and unprocessed in the way they act,\u201d Dearnley said. \u201cThey tend to do things to show how they feel.\u201d</p> <p>How is your wife coping with you being away? Does she have support? You need to look at what\u2019s happening in your son\u2019s life as a whole, not only what\u2019s happening at nursery.</p> <p>\u201cYou both need to explain to your son that it\u2019s OK to be upset and angry, but it\u2019s not OK to hit and push other children,\u201d Dearnley said. And you need to repeat this (in fact, you need to say everything many times to a two-year-old before they start to take it in). Try asking him why he does it \u2013 even if he doesn\u2019t or can\u2019t answer, it may start a thought process.</p> <p>If your son is perhaps reluctant to talk to you on video when you are away it may be because it\u2019s a reminder of your absence, Dearnley said. This doesn\u2019t mean you should discontinue these video calls, but perhaps speak to him on the phone instead or send letters that your wife can read with him when he wants to. And in case you take these things too personally, try not to. Children, says Dearnley, can be \u201cvery rejecting when parents have been away, and quite cross\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/19/still-virgin-34-whats-wrong-with-me-annalisa-barbieri\">I\u2019m 34 and still a virgin. What\u2019s wrong with me?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Young children can struggle with the concept of time, so a countdown calendar marking the number of days until your return could be effective for your son: even just a piece of paper with squares that can be crossed out each day, a basic timeline. Such simple activities can give children a sense of control: \u201cLet\u2019s see how many more sleeps until Daddy comes home.\u201d</p> <p>Does your son know where you are in the world in relation to him? He may not understand why you can\u2019t just come home every night. Looking at a map would be an interesting exercise. Gentle, persistent explanation will help.

      "bodyText": "My son is two years old. He has recently started bullying (hitting and pushing) children his age. This was shortly after I moved abroad to work while he stayed with my wife, his mother. He attends a nursery and other family gatherings, so is not isolated socially in interacting with other people. I keep almost daily video contact with him for a few minutes (as a child, he can\u2019t stand in front of a device for long). He knows me, calls me and interacts with me. I have 10 days\u2019 leave every six to eight weeks which I plan to use to stay with my family, including my son. Do you have any advice for me and my wife on how to treat our son, and make him feel and act better? I\u2019m really pleased you have made the connection between how your son feels and how he acts \u2013 many parents don\u2019t. I consulted Katy Dearnley, a consultant child psychotherapist who specialises in children under five. Each of us wondered about the chronology: did your departure and your son\u2019s starting nursery coincide? \u201cIf so,\u201d Dearnley said, \u201cthis would be a double separation for your son to deal with.\u201d On its own, your leaving is a big event for him to cope with. He\u2019s also two years old, the age at which children learn that they are separate entities from their parents (an essential stage of development). This can trigger certain behaviours. \u201cIt can arouse very strong concerns about being left out,\u201d Dearnley said. \u201cThis can be why toddlers who previously went to bed with no issues suddenly want to stay up.\u201d How was your departure handled? Sometimes parents slip away without an explanation, fearing a painful goodbye, or believing their children are too young to understand. \u201cNever disappear without saying goodbye, no matter how upset he may be,\u201d Dearnley said. \u201cComing to terms with the feelings that separation can cause is an essential part of growing up. Your son needs to be prepared not only for your departures, but also for when you come back. Children often believe that events are caused by something they have done, and your son will need to be reassured that your departure is nothing to do with him, and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s done anything wrong.\u201d Remember: children think the world revolves around them and therefore that they can make bad things happen. Dearnley also wanted to know more about the hitting and pushing: when it happens and if it only happens at nursery. If it\u2019s unprovoked, this would suggest some anxiety or distress in your son. \u201cTwo-year-olds are very instinctive and unprocessed in the way they act,\u201d Dearnley said. \u201cThey tend to do things to show how they feel.\u201d How is your wife coping with you being away? Does she have support? You need to look at what\u2019s happening in your son\u2019s life as a whole, not only what\u2019s happening at nursery. \u201cYou both need to explain to your son that it\u2019s OK to be upset and angry, but it\u2019s not OK to hit and push other children,\u201d Dearnley said. And you need to repeat this (in fact, you need to say everything many times to a two-year-old before they start to take it in). Try asking him why he does it \u2013 even if he doesn\u2019t or can\u2019t answer, it may start a thought process. If your son is perhaps reluctant to talk to you on video when you are away it may be because it\u2019s a reminder of your absence, Dearnley said. This doesn\u2019t mean you should discontinue these video calls, but perhaps speak to him on the phone instead or send letters that your wife can read with him when he wants to. And in case you take these things too personally, try not to. Children, says Dearnley, can be \u201cvery rejecting when parents have been away, and quite cross\u201d. Young children can struggle with the concept of time, so a countdown calendar marking the number of days until your return could be effective for your son: even just a piece of paper with squares that can be crossed out each day, a basic timeline. Such simple activities can give children a sense of control: \u201cLet\u2019s see how many more sleeps until Daddy comes home.\u201d Does your son know where you are in the world in relation to him? He may not understand why you can\u2019t just come home every night. Looking at a map would be an interesting exercise. Gentle, persistent explanation will help. As he gets older, this will become easier for all of you. Finally, how are you coping with the separation?",

The 23-year-old has been a model of consistency this season, easily running under 11sec in all four of her 100m races, and she is determined to keep her streak going at the UK trials for the world championships in Doha next month. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019ve been able to stay under 11 seconds all year is great,\u201d says Asher-Smith. \u201cAnd I really want to keep it that way. It\u2019s for my own satisfaction. Even if I see a headwind of -3 metres/second I will be fuming but I will still be going for it. It\u2019s a little game I am playing with myself.\u201d With temperatures expected to soar over 27C, Asher-Smith is understandably hopeful of breaking her own British championship record of 10.97sec, set last year. \u201cI\u2019m really excited. It\u2019s another chance to run on home soil, which I love. The British trials is always a great event and it is going to be one of the last ever races at the stadium. So I guess I\u2019ll have to give it a nice hurrah.\u201d While the IAAF\u2019s controversial new rankings rate Asher-Smith as the top athlete in the world over 100m and 200m \u2013 and she is nearly two-tenths quicker over 100m this season than her nearest British rival Jodie Williams \u2013 she insists she is not getting carried away. \u201cIt is all well and good running fast throughout the season but you have to make the team. I don\u2019t take any of that for granted.\u201d",

I believe I can run 9.8, possibly a 9.7 but we\u2019ll see. Sometimes the wind can fluctuate at the Alexander Stadium, it all depends how I execute my race but I\u2019m in good shape and looking forward to it.\u201d For good measure Hughes is also running in the 200m as he seeks to become the first man to win over 100m and 200m at the UK trials since Marlon Devonish in 2007. But he knows the double will not be easy given Miguel Francis and Adam Gemili \u2013 who have both run sub\u201120sec for 200m \u2013 are in the field. \u201cThose guys are really good,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cThey show up when it matters, they are great competitors. Aside from us being competitors at trials, we are quite cool. We have the same determination. We\u2019re ambitious to make it on to the podium. But I\u2019m looking forward to competing, getting the job done and securing my spot for the world championships in Doha next month.\u201d It is more than four years since Hughes was hailed as the next Usain Bolt after switching allegiances to Britain from the Caribbean island of Anguilla as a teenager. And while no one can hold a candle to Bolt, with whom he used to train, Hughes is now ranked third in the world over 100m after recovering from a serious knee injury. \u201cI\u2019ve learned from Usain that it\u2019s about consistency, trust in yourself, not doubting yourself regardless of everything and despite if you\u2019re not having the best season. Learn to have confidence in yourself, enjoy the moment and trust in yourself.\u201d The potential absence of Christian Coleman from the world championships next month after allegedly missing three drug tests means that Hughes will be seen as a big contender for gold, especially over 100m, but he insists he is not feeling any extra pressure. \u201cI try not to let the pressure get to me, even though the spotlight may be on me. I\u2019m quite laidback. I find ways to keep calm by playing video games, listening to music, doing some online shopping and not thinking too much about racing. Because that\u2019s when it gets draining and that\u2019s when the pressure can consume you. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m on checkout at Selfridges. I\u2019m always buying some little designer things. When it comes to games, I\u2019m playing Fifa and also Mortal Kombat \u2013 I like getting my fatalities there.\u201d Remaining tickets for the M\u00fcller British Athletics Championships are on sale at the British Athletics box office in the spectator village at the Alexander Stadium",

      "body": "<p>Some of us, I suspect, have an unduly romantic image of the way our food and drink is produced. In the case of wine, it\u2019s probably a small, family-run domaine in the depths of the French countryside, passed on from father to son, making simple, honest wines that taste the way they did 40 years ago.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of thinking anything bigger is automatically bad, and that this means dull, poor-quality wines \u2013 and few wineries are bigger, in France at least, than a co-op. But the truth is, co-ops may meet the needs of the small grower better these days than going out on their own.</p> <p>They certainly think so at Plaimont, a huge enterprise in the Gers in south-west France that supplies a good deal of cheap and cheerful drinking under the C\u00f4tes de Gascogne label. They have 800 growers, five wineries and an annual turnover of \u20ac73m, but they have revived and re-energised the wine industry in the region. Alongside the everyday drinking they provide for the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, they are busy converting an increasing percentage of their 5,300 hectares of vineyard to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/12/natural-selection-four-of-the-best-additive-free-wines\">organic</a>, dabbling in sulphur-free wines and reviving long-lost grape varieties \u2013 most interestingly tardif and manseng noir, which they are planting to bring down the alcohol level of the native tannat grape. They are also successfully vinifying it on its own, making a deliciously funky red (the C\u00f4tes de Gascogne Manseng Noir \u00a314.80 <a href=\"https://www.lescaves.co.uk/lescaves-welcome\" title=\"\">Les Caves de Pyr\u00e8ne</a>, 11%), which is about as far from a stereotypical co-op wine as you can imagine.</p> <p>I asked one of their growers whether he would rather have his own name on the bottle. Not if he couldn\u2019t sell it, he said. \u201cAt the end of the 70s, in this region, everything was dying. It was all about cheap wine. We wouldn\u2019t have survived if we hadn\u2019t created our own identity. Thanks to our local grapes, we\u2019ve opened up new markets and everyone can make a living.\u201d</p> <p>Plaimont is far from the exception. Trawl through the average supermarket and you\u2019ll spot the names. <a href=\"http://chablisienne.com/en/history/\" title=\"\">La Chablisienne</a> co-op supplies a lot of the chablis we drink, with a longstanding partnership at M&amp;S; the <a href=\"https://www.cavedetain.com/en/\" title=\"\">Cave de Tain</a> in the northern Rh\u00f4ne provides us with most of the crozes hermitage, and <a href=\"https://www.araldicavini.com/\" title=\"\">Araldica</a> in Piedmont a great deal of the gavi and barbera you\u2019ll come across. If co-ops didn\u2019t exist, we would probably have to invent them. They have certainly re-invented themselves.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t know the name?

      "bodyText": "Some of us, I suspect, have an unduly romantic image of the way our food and drink is produced. In the case of wine, it\u2019s probably a small, family-run domaine in the depths of the French countryside, passed on from father to son, making simple, honest wines that taste the way they did 40 years ago. It\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of thinking anything bigger is automatically bad, and that this means dull, poor-quality wines \u2013 and few wineries are bigger, in France at least, than a co-op. But the truth is, co-ops may meet the needs of the small grower better these days than going out on their own. They certainly think so at Plaimont, a huge enterprise in the Gers in south-west France that supplies a good deal of cheap and cheerful drinking under the C\u00f4tes de Gascogne label. They have 800 growers, five wineries and an annual turnover of \u20ac73m, but they have revived and re-energised the wine industry in the region. Alongside the everyday drinking they provide for the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, they are busy converting an increasing percentage of their 5,300 hectares of vineyard to organic, dabbling in sulphur-free wines and reviving long-lost grape varieties \u2013 most interestingly tardif and manseng noir, which they are planting to bring down the alcohol level of the native tannat grape. They are also successfully vinifying it on its own, making a deliciously funky red (the C\u00f4tes de Gascogne Manseng Noir \u00a314.80 Les Caves de Pyr\u00e8ne, 11%), which is about as far from a stereotypical co-op wine as you can imagine. I asked one of their growers whether he would rather have his own name on the bottle. Not if he couldn\u2019t sell it, he said. \u201cAt the end of the 70s, in this region, everything was dying. It was all about cheap wine. We wouldn\u2019t have survived if we hadn\u2019t created our own identity. Thanks to our local grapes, we\u2019ve opened up new markets and everyone can make a living.\u201d Plaimont is far from the exception. Trawl through the average supermarket and you\u2019ll spot the names. La Chablisienne co-op supplies a lot of the chablis we drink, with a longstanding partnership at M&amp;S; the Cave de Tain in the northern Rh\u00f4ne provides us with most of the crozes hermitage, and Araldica in Piedmont a great deal of the gavi and barbera you\u2019ll come across. If co-ops didn\u2019t exist, we would probably have to invent them. They have certainly re-invented themselves. Don\u2019t know the name? Try these wines anyway C\u00f4tes de Saint Mont Les Vignes Retrouv\u00e9es 2017 \u00a38.95 The Wine Society 13.5%. Exotically fruity but dry blend of the indigenous gros manseng, petit courbu and arrufiac. Would be good with a pad thai. Incidentally, the Wine Society is a co-op too. Gavi Quadro Sei 2018 \u00a38 Marks &amp; Spencer, 12.5%. Crisp, whistle clean white from the Araldica co-op in Piemonte. Drink with grilled prawns or a creamy risotto. Cop de Ma Priorat 2017 \u00a313 larger Co-ops, 14%. Bold, ballsy blend of garnacha and mazuela (carignan) from the newly set up Vinis Catalonia (Cop de Ma means lend a hand). Great with a steak. Fleurie 2018 \u00a310 Marks &amp; Spencer, 13%. Pretty, juicy Beaujolais from the Cave des Producteurs de Fleurie. Serve chilled with a picnic.

      "bodyText": "Punjab has become the latest region in Pakistan to ban plastic bags, as the country battles to reduce single-use plastics that are damaging the environment. So far there is no date for implementation in Pakistan\u2019s most populous state. The south-eastern province of Sindh has announced it will ban polythene bags from October, and last week a ban took effect in Islamabad. Residents in the capital city will be fined $70 (\u00a357) if they are caught using a polyethylene bag \u2013 nearly a month\u2019s wages for a labourer. Plastic manufacturers and shopkeepers will also face fines. One shopkeeper in Islamabad was fined 200,000 PKR (\u00a31,030) for using plastic bags, following an inspection by Farzana Altaf, director general of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency. Altaf and her staff were bustled out of the Savour Foods takeaway restaurant in the capital in an incident tweeted by Zartaj Gul, the minister of state for climate change. The manager of another store was fined 50,000 PKR. After Punjab\u2019s chief minister affirmed the ban would happen, Gul tweeted that she was \u201cdelighted to announce that CM Punjab, @UsmanAKBuzdar has thankfully given assent to my request to ban plastic shopping bags in Punjab too!\u201d For more than a decade, Pakistan\u2019s provinces have imposed bans on single-use plastic bags but local governments have failed to implement the policy, and people have no cheap alternatives. But Malik Amin Aslam, adviser to the prime minister on climate change, told the Guardian: \u201cThere is a political commitment to rid Pakistan of plastic. Its use has a huge health and economic cost. And we have taken this step to make a difference and we have put heavy penalties [on those] who don\u2019t respect the ban.\u201d Aslam said the government would support traders seeking alternatives. \u201cAt the moment, we are introducing paper bags,\u201d he said, adding that the cabinet had declared banning plastics \u201ca national goal\u201d. Hassaan Sipra, a scientific officer at the Centre for Climate Research and Development at Comsats University in Islamabad, was sceptical that change would happen. \u201cImplementation of laws has always been an issue in Pakistan. The current government has shown a serious attitude to make this ban successful but they have to implement it and monitor too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has to make a difference this time because failure has a devastating cost to the environment,\u201d said Afia Salam, an environmental journalist. \u201cOf course, you will not see change overnight and the effectiveness will depend on the implementing agencies.\u201d In Islamabad, it\u2019s still early days. At the F-6 supermarket, Kamran Ahmed wasn\u2019t offered a paper bag when he bought vegetables. Carrying them in his hands to his car, he said: \u201cThe government has banned plastic bags but many shops are not offering alternatives in place of plastic bags. This is so frustrating.\u201d",

It signed an agreement with the University of the West Indies to fund a joint centre for development research, at a ceremony in Glasgow on Friday morning. Glasgow University discovered last year it had benefited financially from Scottish slave traders in the 18th and 19th centuries by between \u00a316.7m and \u00a3198m in today\u2019s money. In what is thought to be the first attempt by a British university to set up a programme of restorative justice, it has pledged to raise \u00a320m for the centre, chiefly in research grants and gifts. Other British universities, including Oxford and Bristol, have been the focus of protests over their ties to the slave trade and to powerful colonialists, such as Cecil Rhodes. In 2017, All Souls College at Oxford launched an annual scholarship for Caribbean students and paid a \u00a3100,000 grant to a college in Barbados, in recognition of its funding from Christopher Codrington, a wealthy slave owner who bequeathed \u00a310,000 in 1710 to build a library that bears his name. The Glasgow agreement was first signed in Kingston, Jamaica, on 31 July.

Over several years England\u2019s former kicking guru has helped to turn the presently injured Johnny Sexton into one of the game\u2019s most reliable kickers. So how will he feel if Sexton has a penalty or a conversion attempt to beat England in the last moments of the 2019 final in Yokohama? \u201cIf Sexton\u2019s got a kick to win it, I hope he kicks it,\u201d Alred says.</p> <p>Should it happen, the Rugby Football Union can hardly protest. It has not seen fit to hire Alred for almost eight years, despite his extraordinary CV. While he has been assisting George Ford on a private basis \u2013 the recent improvement in Ford\u2019s kicking repertoire is there for all to see \u2013 no one at Twickenham has invited him to mentor the next generation. Great news for Molinari but not, necessarily, for England\u2019s future kicking prospects.</p> <p>Then again, Alred drifted out of love with the RFU hierarchy some time ago. \u201cWhen I first got involved with England, if you\u2019d cut my arm off there would have been a rose inside there.

      "bodyText": "Sitting in the corner of a pub on the outskirts of Taunton is the man whose unseen work could shape the upcoming World Cup. Without him Jonny Wilkinson might also not have kicked England to glory in 2003 and numerous other athletes in other sports would still be underachieving. The 2018 Open champion, Francesco Molinari, is just the latest to have profited from the most versatile swing doctor in the business. Now into his 70s but still mahogany tanned and eagle of eye, Dave Alred effectively has a foot in Ireland\u2019s camp these days. Over several years England\u2019s former kicking guru has helped to turn the presently injured Johnny Sexton into one of the game\u2019s most reliable kickers. So how will he feel if Sexton has a penalty or a conversion attempt to beat England in the last moments of the 2019 final in Yokohama? \u201cIf Sexton\u2019s got a kick to win it, I hope he kicks it,\u201d Alred says. Should it happen, the Rugby Football Union can hardly protest. It has not seen fit to hire Alred for almost eight years, despite his extraordinary CV. While he has been assisting George Ford on a private basis \u2013 the recent improvement in Ford\u2019s kicking repertoire is there for all to see \u2013 no one at Twickenham has invited him to mentor the next generation. Great news for Molinari but not, necessarily, for England\u2019s future kicking prospects. Then again, Alred drifted out of love with the RFU hierarchy some time ago. \u201cWhen I first got involved with England, if you\u2019d cut my arm off there would have been a rose inside there. Sadly the rose isn\u2019t there any more,\u201d he says. \u201cIt went in 2004 when things changed at the RFU and they started to say \u2018no\u2019 to everything we were suggesting. Let\u2019s say I was working for Ireland now and they were playing England. I\u2019d want Ireland to win for everyone in the group.\u201d Only when Martin Johnson invited him back before the 2011 World Cup did Alred relent, albeit briefly. \u201cIn 2011 I felt I was working for the players, I wasn\u2019t working for England.

Lygo said he hoped BritBox, the ITV-controlled streaming service it is launching with the BBC later this year, would allow the commercial broadcaster to build a new revenue stream by charging viewers who wanted to see classic British television. But he also pointed out that traditional television channels still reached millions of people, even in the face of declining overall ratings and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/22/channel-4-is-battling-netflix-and-porn-says-its-chief-executive\">industry-wide collapse</a> in youth audiences for live viewing.</p> \n<p>The veteran TV commissioner also urged channels to stop producing travelogue programmes where \u201ca bunch of B-list celebrities go off to Mykonos and look at their feet\u201d.</p> \n<p>Instead, he is hoping that a forthcoming ITV programme called The Masked Singer \u2013 in which celebrities perform songs while hidden beneath outlandish costumes and the audience has to guess their real identity \u2013 will be a hit.</p> \n<p>However, Lygo admitted that there were risks with transferring the successful US format to a British audience: \u201cThe challenge for the production company is avoiding the reveal being \u2018who the fuck is that\u2019?

Despite this, Lygo told an audience at the Edinburgh television festival that he had never considered cancelling Love Island \u2013 a ratings hit among young audiences that will now be shown twice a year \u2013 after two former contestants took their own lives. \u201cI don\u2019t feel there is a direct connection or enough significance to cancel Love Island because someone who was on it has gone through a tragic experience,\u201d he said, pointing out that the two deaths happened some time after the contestants appeared on the programme and adding that suicide was a complex issue. ITV has had a torrid year, with the controversy over The Jeremy Kyle Show combining with a falling share price. Lygo said he hoped BritBox, the ITV-controlled streaming service it is launching with the BBC later this year, would allow the commercial broadcaster to build a new revenue stream by charging viewers who wanted to see classic British television. But he also pointed out that traditional television channels still reached millions of people, even in the face of declining overall ratings and an industry-wide collapse in youth audiences for live viewing. The veteran TV commissioner also urged channels to stop producing travelogue programmes where \u201ca bunch of B-list celebrities go off to Mykonos and look at their feet\u201d. Instead, he is hoping that a forthcoming ITV programme called The Masked Singer \u2013 in which celebrities perform songs while hidden beneath outlandish costumes and the audience has to guess their real identity \u2013 will be a hit. However, Lygo admitted that there were risks with transferring the successful US format to a British audience: \u201cThe challenge for the production company is avoiding the reveal being \u2018who the fuck is that\u2019? They got Donny Osmond and La Toya Jackson, we\u2019ll probably have Su Pollard and Christopher Biggins.\u201d In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here",

White triangles with a red border are used for warnings., 2:D - Red lines are used on some roads instead of yellow lines. In London the double and single red lines used on Red Routes indicate that stopping to park, load/unload or to board and alight from a vehicle (except for a licensed taxi or if you hold a Blue Badge) is prohibited. , 3:D - You should approach any steep downgrade with care. Prepare for hazards early as stopping safely is harder on a steep downgrade. Be mindful that vehicles behind you may not be able to stop as quickly. You should descend at a controlled speed, using a lower gear., 4:B - The Highway Code includes basic first aid information that drivers need to learn. The code was updated this week, and now, rather than 10 minutes as previously stated, it recommends cooling the burn for at least 20 minutes with plenty of clean, cool water., 5:C - You must not drive in a bicycle lane unless it is bordered by a broken white line and entering is unavoidable - you need to enter to turn or to avoid an obstruction., 6:A - The sign states that no vehicles are allowed past this point. Bicycles may only proceed past this sign if pushed., 7:A - Information about the maximum permitted noseweight should be found in your vehicle handbook or obtained from the manufacturer., 8:D - This HOV lane requires cars to have at least two occupants - the driver and at least one passenger., 9:D - Rule 187 of the Highway Code states that in all cases watch out for and give plenty of room to cyclists and horse riders who may stay in the left-hand lane and signal right if they intend to continue round the roundabout. Allow them to do so., 10:B - No horses may be taken beyond this point., 11:B - At 50mph it will take 13 car lengths to stop - the equivalent of 53 metres or 175 feet, 12:C - Puffin crossings use sensors to determine if pedestrians have completed their crossing, and will hold the red light phase longer if they are crossing slowly., 13:D - This is the only time it is permitted to use a hand-held phone. The Highway Code states that it is far safer not to use any telephone, even hands-free, while you are driving or riding - it recommends you find a safe place to stop first., 14:A - It is an offence to use fog lights if the visibility is better than 100 metres. The Highway Code stresses that you must switch front fog lights off if the fog clears to avoid dazzling others, but also remain aware that fog may be patchy.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"3\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Congratulations, you passed.\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in the driving theory test and passed.\" data-min-score=\"12\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">12 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Congratulations, you passed.</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"This score would fail you in the real test.

But, regardless of where you take the practical test, would-be drivers in Great Britain are required to take a theory test as well before getting their driving licence. But, once we are out on the road, not all of us can remember every detail. And some of us started driving long enough ago that the theory test didn\u2019t exist. Take our quiz to see how well you would fare if you had to sit your theory test today. Would you still pass your driving theory test? Please note: in the real test candidates face 50 multiple choice questions if they are seeking a licence for cars and motorcycles, and 100 questions if they want to drive lorries, buses and coaches. The pass mark for the 50 question test is 43.

      "body": "<p>In the past, pop has represented the ultimate fairytale story via the promise of a seamless transformation from the mundane to the megastar. In the 90s, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/25/spice-girls-review-nostalgia-live-croke-park-dublin\">Spice Girls</a> became the biggest cultural phenomenon on the planet after answering an advert in The Stage, while up until recently shows like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz+tv-and-radio/the-x-factor\">The X Factor</a> and Britain\u2019s Got Talent have taken receptionists, call centre employees and recent stage school alumni and made their dreams (temporarily) come true.</p> <p>In 2019, however, numerous artists are balancing the glamour of pop with nine-to-fives: dance-pop duo Nimmo funded their recent debut with \u201cnormal\u201d jobs after leaving a previous major-label deal, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/20/rosie-lowe-on-vodka-in-the-park-sex-therapy-and-neo-soul\">Rosie Lowe</a> supplements her income as a part-time piano tutor. Most interesting of all are the four members of Unperfect, a new UK girlband signed to the independent label Xenomania by Brian Higgins, AKA the mastermind behind Girls Aloud, who all have day jobs. Scour their Instagram stories and in between the heavily styled press shots and obligatory Spotify promo you\u2019d come to expect from any self-respecting pop act, there are videos of Soipan (full-time mum and part-time barmaid), Tiah (student), Chloe (model) and Siobhan (administrative personnel assistant for Lidl) going about their daily business.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBA22pgEqpo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pBA22pgEqpo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI love working for Lidl, but being in a girlband is my dream,\u201d Siobhan, 26, tells me on the phone on the one day a week she isn\u2019t working in the supermarket\u2019s Southampton warehouse. \u201cWith music, you never know what can happen,\u201d she continues, echoing a new, more cautious approach to that notion of fairytale. \u201cI\u2019m working because, if anything happens, I need to pay my mortgage.

      "bodyText": "In the past, pop has represented the ultimate fairytale story via the promise of a seamless transformation from the mundane to the megastar. In the 90s, the Spice Girls became the biggest cultural phenomenon on the planet after answering an advert in The Stage, while up until recently shows like The X Factor and Britain\u2019s Got Talent have taken receptionists, call centre employees and recent stage school alumni and made their dreams (temporarily) come true. In 2019, however, numerous artists are balancing the glamour of pop with nine-to-fives: dance-pop duo Nimmo funded their recent debut with \u201cnormal\u201d jobs after leaving a previous major-label deal, while Rosie Lowe supplements her income as a part-time piano tutor. Most interesting of all are the four members of Unperfect, a new UK girlband signed to the independent label Xenomania by Brian Higgins, AKA the mastermind behind Girls Aloud, who all have day jobs. Scour their Instagram stories and in between the heavily styled press shots and obligatory Spotify promo you\u2019d come to expect from any self-respecting pop act, there are videos of Soipan (full-time mum and part-time barmaid), Tiah (student), Chloe (model) and Siobhan (administrative personnel assistant for Lidl) going about their daily business. \u201cI love working for Lidl, but being in a girlband is my dream,\u201d Siobhan, 26, tells me on the phone on the one day a week she isn\u2019t working in the supermarket\u2019s Southampton warehouse. \u201cWith music, you never know what can happen,\u201d she continues, echoing a new, more cautious approach to that notion of fairytale. \u201cI\u2019m working because, if anything happens, I need to pay my mortgage. I want to get to a point where I can just do music, but at the moment it\u2019s not possible.\u201d Do her Lidl colleagues wonder why she\u2019s still working there? \u201cYeah, every time I come back from video shoots \u2013 which I do in my holiday time \u2013 they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, I thought you\u2019d be off making your millions,\u2019 and it\u2019s like, \u2018You don\u2019t get it.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s this strong DIY ethos that feels so at odds with the continued stereotype of the so-called \u201cmanufactured\u201d pop act, one in which a genuine passion for music is assumed to be at the bottom of a long list.

It sells them through a Peaky Blinders-trademarked website.</p> \n<p>In early 2014, during the run-up to series two, Sadler\u2019s Ales, based in Stourbridge, launched a Peaky Blinder beer <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/sadlers-ales-launches-peaky-blinders-6907399\">citing the show as inspiration</a>. It uses images of the original gang and has since expanded to include gin, whisky and rum and a \u201cfan pack\u201d offering a flat cap and razor pin. In 2017, the company registered \u201cPeaky Blinder\u201d as its official trademark in the beer and spirits category.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The TV show makers] couldn\u2019t release a Peaky Blinder gin as that would encroach on our intellectual property,\u201d says Chris Dew, the marketing manager at Sadler\u2019s Brewery. \u201cInitially, we were celebrated by the show; there were shots of the cast drinking the beer. But as time has gone on and the show has got bigger we have disassociated from each other to stay in our lanes.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Our trademark system is what is known as a first-to-file system</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Lawyer Iain Connor</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Ironically, early last year when the show\u2019s makers made an attempt to trademark the Peaky Blinders name in 10 categories of products, it was opposed by Chaos Brothers and Halewood International, <a href=\"https://halewood-int.com/our-business/breweries/sadlers-brewery/\">which owns Sadler\u2019s Brewery</a> and also Windsor Castle Brewery, which has a \u201cPeaky\u201d beer. The issue remains mired at the European International Property Office.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur trademark system is what is known as a first-to-file system,\u201d says Iain Connor, a lawyer with Pinsent Masons. \u201cIf you get there first you have the rights. It seems obvious to register a trademark [beyond TV] but you don\u2019t know if you have a hit show on your hands; everyone misses the boat as it is often last on the list.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jane Smith, the group director of licensing and gaming at Endemol Shine, which handles the Peaky Blinders business, says that because the show is based on a true story it cannot nail down all the rights.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe work very hard on registering trademarks and in terms of infringements we are very active,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know there were people ahead of us. We have had conversations about how to resolve issues and coexist.

The move to top billing on primetime BBC1 will give Peaky Blinders an extra boost among UK audiences of at least 50% beyond its old home on BBC2, providing the perfect marketing springboard to fuel the ambitious commercial expansion of the brand. A near-two-year wait for a new series has served to raise the excitement level among fans. In July, more than 76,000 people applied for tickets to the first exclusive screening of the season five premiere held in Birmingham town hall. Knight is using his hometown to launch the first official Peaky Blinders festival next month, with two days of music, fashion, street food \u2013 and even a \u201cbespoke ballet Rambert performance\u201d \u2013 in the Digbeth and Small Heath areas of Birmingham, where the original gang were based. While it is full steam ahead on the commercialisation front, there is a certain irony that the makers of a TV show about a gangster family seeking to outwit rivals have found themselves exploited by those looking to tap into the Peaky Blinders effect. Less than two months after the first series debuted on BBC2, a Leamington Spa-based company called Chaos Brothers filed to officially trademark \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d for use selling the peaked caps made famous by the show. It sells them through a Peaky Blinders-trademarked website. In early 2014, during the run-up to series two, Sadler\u2019s Ales, based in Stourbridge, launched a Peaky Blinder beer citing the show as inspiration. It uses images of the original gang and has since expanded to include gin, whisky and rum and a \u201cfan pack\u201d offering a flat cap and razor pin. In 2017, the company registered \u201cPeaky Blinder\u201d as its official trademark in the beer and spirits category. \u201c[The TV show makers] couldn\u2019t release a Peaky Blinder gin as that would encroach on our intellectual property,\u201d says Chris Dew, the marketing manager at Sadler\u2019s Brewery. \u201cInitially, we were celebrated by the show; there were shots of the cast drinking the beer. But as time has gone on and the show has got bigger we have disassociated from each other to stay in our lanes.\u201d Ironically, early last year when the show\u2019s makers made an attempt to trademark the Peaky Blinders name in 10 categories of products, it was opposed by Chaos Brothers and Halewood International, which owns Sadler\u2019s Brewery and also Windsor Castle Brewery, which has a \u201cPeaky\u201d beer. The issue remains mired at the European International Property Office. \u201cOur trademark system is what is known as a first-to-file system,\u201d says Iain Connor, a lawyer with Pinsent Masons. \u201cIf you get there first you have the rights. It seems obvious to register a trademark [beyond TV] but you don\u2019t know if you have a hit show on your hands; everyone misses the boat as it is often last on the list.\u201d Jane Smith, the group director of licensing and gaming at Endemol Shine, which handles the Peaky Blinders business, says that because the show is based on a true story it cannot nail down all the rights. \u201cWe work very hard on registering trademarks and in terms of infringements we are very active,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know there were people ahead of us. We have had conversations about how to resolve issues and coexist. Never do they touch the TV series, that is our red line.\u201d Earlier this year, a Manchester bar called Peaky Blinders was warned that it was infringing the show\u2019s copyright. A manager at the bar said it took down images from the show it had on the walls. However, a Google search still retains an image of the bar as it was \u2013 complete with a floor-to-ceiling image of Cillian Murphy\u2019s character smoking a cigarette. With Peaky Blinders fever continuing to mount, where does Knight think he can take his creation next; the big screen perhaps? \u201cI think everybody would be in,\u201d Knight says. \u201cI think wait until we have done seven series, then I think it would be very tempting to put it on the big screen. A one-off event that happens to the Shelby family that we make into a feature.\u201d",

Tallach, 52, believes the vast majority of the 32 people to successfully take their test in the village in the 12 months to March were his clients \u2013 and he hopes his methods are a part of their success.</p> <p>So what\u2019s the secret? \u201cI don\u2019t teach people to pass their tests. A lot of people come to me and say, \u2018I want to pass my test.\u2019 I tend to teach people to drive as a skill,\u201d says Tallach, who explains that he only lets his pupils go for their licence when they are truly ready to hit the road on their own.</p> <p>And he can point to evidence that his tough, no-nonsense approach gets results. A few years ago, Tallach says, he taught an entire class at the local school to pass their tests at the first attempt.</p> <p>As for the drivers who he says show up in search of an easier ride, Tallach has a dim view of their tactics \u2013 and of their abilities. \u201cI\u2019ve turned down people from London, Glasgow, Edinburgh,\u201d he says. \u201cThey book their test knowing it\u2019s a high pass rate, thinking it\u2019s easy. I take them out driving and they can\u2019t even change gear.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2c2ac8527b148fd2392f2837fafb90e2767942c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2c2ac8527b148fd2392f2837fafb90e2767942c/111_482_5597_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Driving instructor Kenny Tallach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As well as a successful driving instructor, Kenny Tallach is also a fireman and drives Gairloch\u2019s school bus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Jolly Northpix/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The figures, released last month by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), show that rural areas tend to have better pass rates than towns and cities across the board. Remote locations in and around the Scottish Highlands and the Hebrides make up nine out of the 10 places in the country with the best pass rates. By contrast, among locations with the worst records, Birmingham is joined by other spots in London, Manchester and Liverpool.</p> <p>The figures also reveal that nationally there has been a creeping decline in results, with pass rates at their lowest in a decade from a high of 47.1%, and that women tend to have a lower success rate than men \u2013 currently 42.4% to 49.6%. There have been previous concerns over variable pass rates, with the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/03/black-women-far-less-likely-than-white-men-to-pass-driving-tests\">revealing last year</a> that 32% of black women pass, against 56% of white men.</p> <p>Though Tallach clearly has a knack for preparing his learners for the road, there are questions over the wider significance of the new figures. Andrew Morris, a professor at Loughborough University who specialises in human factors in transport safety, said: \u201cIt could just be they are better drivers and they train them better in Gairloch. That could be the case and, if it is, then well done. The driving instructor must be very proud of his record.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1sMYI3m0uDaMxomlome_TOOBW0J2olUa3Jg6bIA96sis\" data-alt=\"Pass rates in England, Scotland and Wales\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1sMYI3m0uDaMxomlome_TOOBW0J2olUa3Jg6bIA96sis\">Pass rates in England, Scotland and Wales</a> </figure>  <p>However, he added: \u201cIt is more difficult to drive in urban areas because there\u2019s more going on. You\u2019ve got lots of distractions, higher concentrations of traffic, lots of decisions to make, you\u2019ve complex road intersections, lots of pedestrians in urbanised areas.\u201d</p> <p>Edmund King, president of the AA, said it was not possible to attribute the disparity in pass rates to the difference in driving in urban and rural areas as \u201cboth have their challenges\u201d. But he would \u201cnever encourage learner drivers to book their test at a centre with a higher pass rate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are probably other social factors that may be playing a part in the pass rate disparity,\u201d he added. \u201cThe large, urban test centres also tend to be in areas where more people may be on lower incomes. This may mean they have taken fewer driving lessons prior to taking their test, which could have an impact on these centres\u2019 pass rates.\u201d</p> <p>Gordon Witherspoon, the DVSA\u2019s deputy chief driving examiner, said: \u201cAll candidates are assessed to the same level and the result of their test is entirely dependent on their performance on the day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c52eed4f0b552aa307a16993d3be714e0db6a70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c52eed4f0b552aa307a16993d3be714e0db6a70/18_0_5719_3433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gairloch in Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are no roundabouts to test the learner driver in Gairloch, but roadworks may provide the occasional traffic light.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Jolly Northpix/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tallach, who charges \u00a328 for lessons in his VW Golf, acknowledges that learning in the countryside can be different and that he can occasionally be teased as a result. \u201cI do get slagged off, because obviously, we don\u2019t have roundabouts,\u201d he says, although he notes: \u201cWe do have traffic lights now when they dig up the road and that type of thing.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside his day job, Tallach \u2013 who successfully taught 10 of his nieces and nephews to pass first time \u2013 is on call around the clock as the fire station watch manager and also drives the local school bus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/23/quiz-would-you-still-pass-your-driving-theory-test\">Quiz: Would you still pass your driving theory test?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And his experience as a firefighter means he is acutely aware of the dangers faced by motorists. \u201cI really push for high standards,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou can train people and teach people, but once they pass their test, you don\u2019t really want to be going to cut them out of cars and that type of thing.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever urban drivers may believe, he adds, the roads of Gairloch have demons all their own \u2013 a lesson he learned when he moved from the busier Inverness years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different mindset to drive out here to a town and a city,\u201d he says. \u201cI found out here that you\u2019ve got to be a totally different type of driver.\u201d</p>",

It may be no surprise, then, that figures have revealed that the isolated Highlands village of Gairloch has the highest rate of driving test passes in the country, with 86.5% of candidates succeeding against a national average of 45.8%. The pass rate in Gairloch is so stratospheric in comparison to urban areas \u2013 with Birmingham\u2019s Pavilion test centre having the lowest at 28.6% \u2013 that some city drivers are even said to be deliberately heading for the village in the hope of getting an easier ride. And the figures have prompted a lively discussion among experts about whether there should be concern about variable standards, with some arguing that urban test centres may simply have harder conditions. But there is another explanation: the talents of Kenny Tallach, until recently the only driving instructor in the Scottish village and a 27-year veteran of his trade. Tallach, 52, believes the vast majority of the 32 people to successfully take their test in the village in the 12 months to March were his clients \u2013 and he hopes his methods are a part of their success. So what\u2019s the secret? \u201cI don\u2019t teach people to pass their tests. A lot of people come to me and say, \u2018I want to pass my test.\u2019 I tend to teach people to drive as a skill,\u201d says Tallach, who explains that he only lets his pupils go for their licence when they are truly ready to hit the road on their own. And he can point to evidence that his tough, no-nonsense approach gets results. A few years ago, Tallach says, he taught an entire class at the local school to pass their tests at the first attempt. As for the drivers who he says show up in search of an easier ride, Tallach has a dim view of their tactics \u2013 and of their abilities. \u201cI\u2019ve turned down people from London, Glasgow, Edinburgh,\u201d he says. \u201cThey book their test knowing it\u2019s a high pass rate, thinking it\u2019s easy. I take them out driving and they can\u2019t even change gear.\u201d The figures, released last month by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), show that rural areas tend to have better pass rates than towns and cities across the board. Remote locations in and around the Scottish Highlands and the Hebrides make up nine out of the 10 places in the country with the best pass rates. By contrast, among locations with the worst records, Birmingham is joined by other spots in London, Manchester and Liverpool. The figures also reveal that nationally there has been a creeping decline in results, with pass rates at their lowest in a decade from a high of 47.1%, and that women tend to have a lower success rate than men \u2013 currently 42.4% to 49.6%. There have been previous concerns over variable pass rates, with the Guardian revealing last year that 32% of black women pass, against 56% of white men. Though Tallach clearly has a knack for preparing his learners for the road, there are questions over the wider significance of the new figures. Andrew Morris, a professor at Loughborough University who specialises in human factors in transport safety, said: \u201cIt could just be they are better drivers and they train them better in Gairloch. That could be the case and, if it is, then well done. The driving instructor must be very proud of his record.\u201d However, he added: \u201cIt is more difficult to drive in urban areas because there\u2019s more going on. You\u2019ve got lots of distractions, higher concentrations of traffic, lots of decisions to make, you\u2019ve complex road intersections, lots of pedestrians in urbanised areas.\u201d Edmund King, president of the AA, said it was not possible to attribute the disparity in pass rates to the difference in driving in urban and rural areas as \u201cboth have their challenges\u201d. But he would \u201cnever encourage learner drivers to book their test at a centre with a higher pass rate\u201d. \u201cThere are probably other social factors that may be playing a part in the pass rate disparity,\u201d he added. \u201cThe large, urban test centres also tend to be in areas where more people may be on lower incomes. This may mean they have taken fewer driving lessons prior to taking their test, which could have an impact on these centres\u2019 pass rates.\u201d Gordon Witherspoon, the DVSA\u2019s deputy chief driving examiner, said: \u201cAll candidates are assessed to the same level and the result of their test is entirely dependent on their performance on the day.\u201d Tallach, who charges \u00a328 for lessons in his VW Golf, acknowledges that learning in the countryside can be different and that he can occasionally be teased as a result. \u201cI do get slagged off, because obviously, we don\u2019t have roundabouts,\u201d he says, although he notes: \u201cWe do have traffic lights now when they dig up the road and that type of thing.\u201d Alongside his day job, Tallach \u2013 who successfully taught 10 of his nieces and nephews to pass first time \u2013 is on call around the clock as the fire station watch manager and also drives the local school bus. And his experience as a firefighter means he is acutely aware of the dangers faced by motorists. \u201cI really push for high standards,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou can train people and teach people, but once they pass their test, you don\u2019t really want to be going to cut them out of cars and that type of thing.\u201d Whatever urban drivers may believe, he adds, the roads of Gairloch have demons all their own \u2013 a lesson he learned when he moved from the busier Inverness years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different mindset to drive out here to a town and a city,\u201d he says. \u201cI found out here that you\u2019ve got to be a totally different type of driver.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Catalan government has called for tougher penalties for violent crimes after a surge in knife attacks and violent robberies in Barcelona. Miquel Buch, the regional interior minister, said the law needed to be changed after it emerged that 90% of those charged with violence in recent months had been released on bail. Though Barcelona has long been notorious for its pickpockets and bag snatchers these incidents seldom involved violence. However, police officials say there have been 5,331 violent street robberies so far this year, a 30% increase on 2018. Shopkeepers have also reported a sharp rise in violent robberies. Knives have been used in at least 100 crimes, including robbery, fights and homicide, although police say they have not confiscated more knives than usual. In June, a South Korean woman who was part of a government advisory body died from head injuries after she fell during an attack by muggers. On Sunday, the Afghan ambassador to Spain, Humayoon Rasaw, was attacked in central Barcelona and his \u20ac17,000 (\u00a315,000) watch stolen. Critics of the justice system say many thieves operate with impunity because of a law stating that the theft of property worth less than \u20ac400 is a misdemeanour, not a crime. This means many thieves receive only a fine no matter how many times they reoffend. The use of violence is a crime, however, but police say of the 1,529 people charged with such offences, only 165 have been remanded in custody. Despite assurances by the Barcelona mayor, Ada Colau, that the city is safe \u201cbut has some security problems\u201d, the US embassy has advised its citizens to beware of the risks of visiting Barcelona. The issue has led some people to blame Colau, immigrants and the law. Some say the rise in violent crime is due to the influx of unaccompanied minors, young boys mostly from Morocco, of whom more than 6,000 have arrived in the city in the past two years and for whom there are few facilities. However, police say the overwhelming majority were not involved in criminal activity. Police and legal experts are at a loss to explain why many of the non-violent thieves who have operated in the city for years are now using force. Violent crime reached a similar peak in the summer of 2012, but declined steadily until 2016 before rising again. The main factor appears to be a surge in tourism, with many visitors proving to be easy pickings for thieves. Ciutat Vella, the old part of the city that attracts the most tourists, has the highest level of street robberies. In the past year there has also been an increase in gangs forcibly stealing expensive watches.",

More than 20 Jewish actors and playwrights, including Miriam Margolyes and Maureen Lipman, signed an open letter, which said the producers demonstrated \u201ca startling lack of cultural sensitivity and at worst, overt appropriation and erasure of a culture and religion increasingly facing a crisis\u201d. \u201cTo the best of our knowledge, no one in the cast of the UK premiere is Jewish, and neither is the director or anyone on the team,\u201d the letter stated.

Chinese companies have made 15 big acquisitions in the UK so far this year, spending \u00a36.75bn ($8.3bn) \u2013 already more than the $6bn spent on 23 deals last year. Angus Knowles-Cutler, Deloitte\u2019s vice-chair and the head of its China Services Group, said he expected Chinese people to spend more on both UK homes and businesses whatever the outcome of Brexit. Knowles-Cutler, who visits China four or five times a year, said: \u201cThey invest more in the UK than elsewhere, and I think that will increase if anything. The UK is seen as very cheap now. \u201cWhen they look at the UK they think of all the things we are good at. They look at the UK as a small island and wonder how it is that we have the second-highest Nobel prizes [after the US] and came second in the 2016 Olympics [with 27 gold medals, behind the US with 46 and just ahead of China with 26]\u201d. Knowles-Cutler said key items on Chinese shopping lists were education, intellectual property and branded goods that could be taken back to China and sold at scale to the country\u2019s booming middle classes. There are 109 million middle-class people in China compared with 92 million in the US, according to a report by Credit Suisse. Among the UK firms sold to the Chinese or facing takeover bids so far this year: The money transfer company WorldFirst was sold to Ant Financial, reportedly for \u00a3520m. The billionaire Zhang Lei\u2019s Hillhouse Capital picked up Loch Lomond Distillers for \u00a3400m. The Chinese conglomerate Fosun International, which was founded by the Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, owns Wolves FC and is in talks to buy the 178-year-old package holiday operator Thomas Cook. Other firms considered to be at risk of a takeover include the supermarket Morrisons and the Premier Inn owner Whitbread. Chinese state-owned railway constructors and operators are also being tapped up to help deliver HS2, if the high-speed project gets the go-ahead. The chief executive of HS2, Mark Thurston, flew to Beijing recently to discuss China\u2019s offer to provide \u201ca wholesale package to build\u201d the \u00a355.7bn network. Knowles-Cutler said he expected British technology companies to also be targeted by Chinese money as the country concentrates on its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d vision to move away from being the world\u2019s factory and instead design and manufacture more of its own high-value products and services. He said: \u201cThey want to be the leaders in electric cars and green technology, they\u2019re very interested in next generation materials and robotics. People have a tendency to look to the US for future business models, but I believe we should look to China for the future of the digital economy.\u201d Chinese companies are also looking at buying up more of the UK\u2019s private schools. Harrow and Dulwich College have long-established Chinese outposts, five UK schools opened up in China last year and another nine are expected this year. This summer Bright Scholar, the largest operator of international and bilingual schools in China and majority-owned by the billionaire Yeung Kwok-keung, bought CATS colleges for \u00a3150m. It said the purchase of CATS \u2013 which owns day and boarding schools in Cambridge, London, Canterbury and Shanghai \u2013 was part of its aim to build a \u201cglobal network of premium schools\u201d. Ed Ratcliffe, the head of Asia House Advisory, a consultancy that advises Chinese companies on UK investments, said: \u201cA lot of people in China want to get their money out, and the UK is seen as one of the best locations because of our strong legal system and protections. Their money will be neutral once it\u2019s in the UK, and safe if the Chinese government changes its policies.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 August 2019 because WorldFirst was sold to Ant Financial, not Alibaba as an earlier version said. It was further amended on 6 September 2019 because an earlier version referred to Ed Ratcliffe as head of Asia House whereas he is head of Asia House Advisory.",

      "body": "<p>As the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a celebrates its 25th edition since its move from April to September there is no debate about the success of a shift that seemed radical at the time. The third Grand Tour now has a settled place in the season\u2019s narrative, offering a chance for revenge or redemption after the Tour de France, and this year is no exception, given an added twist by a particularly active summer transfer market.</p> <p>The biggest move of the summer was the former Giro d\u2019Italia winner Tom Dumoulin\u2019s transfer to the Jumbo\u2011Visma squad, who have made no bones about their ambition to shake the dominance of Ineos (formerly Team Sky) in the Tour de France. With a budget second only to the British squad, they clearly aim to match Dave Brailsford\u2019s team for strength in depth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/18/cycling-chris-froome-awarded-2011-vuelta-title-after-cobo-doping-ban\">'Better late than never': Chris Froome awarded 2011 Vuelta title after Cobo ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even with Dumoulin waiting in the wings and the Tour revelation Wout van Aert recovering from a serious crash, Jumbo still field the strongest squad by far in the Vuelta, led by Primoz Roglic and the Tour de France third finisher Steven Kruiswijk, supported by the promising American Sepp Kuss. If they can finally take a Grand Tour win, that will tee up a duel next year with Ineos in the Tour; it might also enable Roglic or Kruiswijk to stake a claim as leader before Dumoulin appears.</p> <p>With Simon Yates resting and Chris Froome convalescing, former Vuelta winners are thin on the ground in this year\u2019s field. Nairo Quintana starts among the favourites; after the late withdrawal of the Giro winner Richard Carapaz, he is likely to claim sole leadership of Movistar\u2019s strong squad alongside another former victor, the world champion Alejandro Valverde. It is four years since the Italian Fabio Aru <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/14/fabio-aru-dream-come-true-vuelta\" title=\"\">won his Vuelta</a> and he has yet to show that was more than a flash in the pan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"799bc3d4e219688e5deee22385b135d50be5abda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/799bc3d4e219688e5deee22385b135d50be5abda/0_326_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Movistar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Movistar team ride out at the Vuelta presentation at Castillo de Moraira on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Colombian Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n and the Dane Jakob Fuglsang have redemption on their minds after failing to live up to expectations in July, while among the other favourites the Colombians Miguel-\u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez and Esteban Chaves will look to take full advantage of a mountainous route with a single flat time trial, on French soil in Pau 10 days in.</p> <p>With Froome, Geraint Thomas and the Tour winner Egan Bernal all absent, Team Ineos are built around the seasoned Dutchman Wout Poels and the promising young Briton Tao Geogeghan-Hart, who rode strongly at the Giro this year until his race was wrecked by a crash. Geogeghan\u2011Hart is just one of an up-and-coming generation of British riders along with the Cumbrian James Knox and Lancaster\u2019s Hugh Carthy. After two years of British victories this year\u2019s race is one where the UK contingent will be riding for experience.</p> <p>They all face one of the exceptionally mountainous courses which have come to typify the Vuelta in recent years. The first summit finish is as early as day five and is followed on day nine by a brutally short mountain stage in Andorra, and the time trial in Pau.

      "bodyText": "As the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a celebrates its 25th edition since its move from April to September there is no debate about the success of a shift that seemed radical at the time. The third Grand Tour now has a settled place in the season\u2019s narrative, offering a chance for revenge or redemption after the Tour de France, and this year is no exception, given an added twist by a particularly active summer transfer market. The biggest move of the summer was the former Giro d\u2019Italia winner Tom Dumoulin\u2019s transfer to the Jumbo\u2011Visma squad, who have made no bones about their ambition to shake the dominance of Ineos (formerly Team Sky) in the Tour de France. With a budget second only to the British squad, they clearly aim to match Dave Brailsford\u2019s team for strength in depth. Even with Dumoulin waiting in the wings and the Tour revelation Wout van Aert recovering from a serious crash, Jumbo still field the strongest squad by far in the Vuelta, led by Primoz Roglic and the Tour de France third finisher Steven Kruiswijk, supported by the promising American Sepp Kuss. If they can finally take a Grand Tour win, that will tee up a duel next year with Ineos in the Tour; it might also enable Roglic or Kruiswijk to stake a claim as leader before Dumoulin appears. With Simon Yates resting and Chris Froome convalescing, former Vuelta winners are thin on the ground in this year\u2019s field. Nairo Quintana starts among the favourites; after the late withdrawal of the Giro winner Richard Carapaz, he is likely to claim sole leadership of Movistar\u2019s strong squad alongside another former victor, the world champion Alejandro Valverde. It is four years since the Italian Fabio Aru won his Vuelta and he has yet to show that was more than a flash in the pan. The Colombian Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n and the Dane Jakob Fuglsang have redemption on their minds after failing to live up to expectations in July, while among the other favourites the Colombians Miguel-\u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez and Esteban Chaves will look to take full advantage of a mountainous route with a single flat time trial, on French soil in Pau 10 days in. With Froome, Geraint Thomas and the Tour winner Egan Bernal all absent, Team Ineos are built around the seasoned Dutchman Wout Poels and the promising young Briton Tao Geogeghan-Hart, who rode strongly at the Giro this year until his race was wrecked by a crash. Geogeghan\u2011Hart is just one of an up-and-coming generation of British riders along with the Cumbrian James Knox and Lancaster\u2019s Hugh Carthy. After two years of British victories this year\u2019s race is one where the UK contingent will be riding for experience. They all face one of the exceptionally mountainous courses which have come to typify the Vuelta in recent years. The first summit finish is as early as day five and is followed on day nine by a brutally short mountain stage in Andorra, and the time trial in Pau. There are no fewer than five mountain-top finishes in the eight days prior to the finale in Madrid and there are slim pickings for any sprinters daring enough to start. The fastest of their number is Sam Bennett, who is looking to become only the fifth Irishman to win a Vuelta stage, which would set him up nicely before his move next season to the super-strong Deceuninck squad. Three to watch Primoz Roglic Fourth in last year\u2019s Tour de France and third in this year\u2019s Giro d\u2019Italia, the former ski jumper starts the Vuelta with the strongest team behind him. The only question is whether he can deal with the repeated climbing and the unpredictable nature of the final Grand Tour of the year. Nairo Quintana Vuelta winner in 2016, and Giro victor in a far-off 2014, the Colombian should benefit from Richard Carapaz\u2019s late withdrawal: for once, Movistar have \u201cgoal clarity\u201d rather than merely hoping that weight of numbers will swing things their way. The only downside: he is leaving the Spanish team so they may not be 100% behind him. Sam Bennett The 28-year-old Irish sprinter has 10 wins to his credit this year - most recently three in three days at the BinckBank Tour - but this is his first Grand Tour start of 2019. He was smarting after being left out of the Tour de France and Giro, but will look to stake his claim as one of the finest sprinters of his generation.",

      "bodyText": "In a week when BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme made light of a story about a man punching his wife, it\u2019s a refreshing corrective to see this all-female agitprop cabaret that gives a full-blooded response to sexual inequality in Nigeria. Part of the Edinburgh international festival\u2019s You Are Here season, a strand in which \u201cartists from around the globe invite you to explore where we are now\u201d, director Ifeoma Fafunwa\u2019s show is a collage of monologues and songs performed by a cast of 10 on the theme of women\u2019s rights. \u201cHear word\u201d is pidgin English for \u201clisten and comply\u201d, an ironic title for a performance dealing in resistance and defiance. Its short scenes relate true-life stories not just of child abuse, rape and sex trafficking but also of the more insidious ways women are kept in their place. We see actor Joke Silva as a self-styled queen of the market, boldly rejecting an expectation that women should not work outside the home. And we see many instances of women themselves policing their female friends and relatives to ensure they dress demurely, behave discreetly and remain subservient to men. The Today programme notwithstanding, this consciousness-raising is likely to be more necessary in a patriarchal Nigeria than in the UK, where fourth-wave feminism has its own set of concerns. That cultural difference makes the show less a source of political empowerment than a heartening vision of resistance and emancipation. And that\u2019s all the more the case for its raucous humour, proud sexuality and collective voice of dissent. \u201cI reject all limitations placed on my life expectations,\u201d says actor Omonor in a show that is at once tough and inspirational. \u2022 At Royal Lyceum theatre, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

      "body": "<p>Ten days before David Cameron\u2019s disastrous Brexit referendum in 2016, a group of EU diplomats asked me for my prediction. Ignore the narrative that remain would sweep to inevitable victory, I told them: Britain is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FqAaD_lsRw&amp;t=17s\" title=\"\">heading directly for the exit</a>.</p> <p>Perturbed \u2013 this was not what other journalists were telling them \u2013 they explained what would happen if so. There would never be a favourable deal for Britain. This was an existential question for the EU: they could not incentivise other nations to leave. Their electorates already resented special treatment for Britain, from the rebate to its exemption from Schengen. They had their own domestic anti-EU and anti-immigration political forces to contend with, none of which they wished to encourage. And if their countries suffered any economic damage because of Brexit, then their voters would be even more resentful towards Britain and even less willing to offer concessions. Strikingly, there were no dissenters from this united position.</p> <p>These basic political facts should have underpinned all British coverage of over three years of Brexit debacle. Instead, with honourable exceptions, we have been fed a daily diet of delusion and fantasy: that if only Rule Britannia was screamed with sufficient gusto and with enough decibels, 27 united foreign governments would somehow be faced down. Take the reported claims that Angela Merkel had offered a 30-day timetable to renegotiate: in fact, she simply declared, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/21/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-berlin-merkel-prepares-to-visit-berlin-as-minister-struggles-to-defend-his-collaborators-jibe-live-news\" title=\"\">we said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days to come</a>.\u201d Nothing meaningful is going to be offered or conceded by the EU: it is simply not going to happen, and yet every day several media outlets peddle the deceit that it will.</p> <p>Both the Tories and much of the media are in the grip of a deluded group with ravenous appetites: the more red meat they\u2019ve been thrown \u2013 by David Cameron, then Theresa May, now Boris Johnson \u2013 the fatter and hungrier they\u2019ve got. Each day brings another example of their delusions colliding with reality, yet they only become more fanatical. During the referendum, they told us German car manufacturers would force Merkel to offer Britain a favourable deal. It\u2019s now been revealed that <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexspence/germany-britain-food-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">German food producers might</a> not bother exporting food to us after a disorderly exit from the EU because of bottlenecks at ports.</p> <p>The truth is, nothing will ever satisfy these fantasists. Even if the EU scrubbed away the backstop \u2013 an impossibility \u2013 hardcore Brexiteers are already making it clear that <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/08/22/brexiteer-tories-warn-boris-johnson-stripping-northern-ireland/\" title=\"\">wouldn\u2019t be enough</a>. From the very start of this process there has been a failure to report it properly. There has been no acknowledgement that the EU collectively lacks any incentive to offer meaningful concessions based on the Tories\u2019 red lines. Nor that, even if they did, those who have captured the Conservatives\u2019 commanding heights would refuse them.</p> <p>For the next few weeks, a pantomime beckons, with Tory papers breathlessly claiming that Johnson\u2019s British Bulldog resolve compared to May\u2019s timidity has the EU on the back foot, or preparing to surrender, or about to offer sweeping new concessions. It\u2019s all noise. European governments simply want to ensure that the British government squarely takes the blame for what is to pass. Although the EU is far more prepared for no deal, when their member states do indeed suffer an economic shock, their aggrieved voters will not countenance offering Britain meaningful concessions when it is forced, enfeebled, back to the negotiating table.</p> <p>What will the insatiable Brexit fantasists say then?</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ten days before David Cameron\u2019s disastrous Brexit referendum in 2016, a group of EU diplomats asked me for my prediction. Ignore the narrative that remain would sweep to inevitable victory, I told them: Britain is heading directly for the exit. Perturbed \u2013 this was not what other journalists were telling them \u2013 they explained what would happen if so. There would never be a favourable deal for Britain. This was an existential question for the EU: they could not incentivise other nations to leave. Their electorates already resented special treatment for Britain, from the rebate to its exemption from Schengen. They had their own domestic anti-EU and anti-immigration political forces to contend with, none of which they wished to encourage. And if their countries suffered any economic damage because of Brexit, then their voters would be even more resentful towards Britain and even less willing to offer concessions. Strikingly, there were no dissenters from this united position. These basic political facts should have underpinned all British coverage of over three years of Brexit debacle. Instead, with honourable exceptions, we have been fed a daily diet of delusion and fantasy: that if only Rule Britannia was screamed with sufficient gusto and with enough decibels, 27 united foreign governments would somehow be faced down. Take the reported claims that Angela Merkel had offered a 30-day timetable to renegotiate: in fact, she simply declared, \u201cwe said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days to come.\u201d Nothing meaningful is going to be offered or conceded by the EU: it is simply not going to happen, and yet every day several media outlets peddle the deceit that it will. Both the Tories and much of the media are in the grip of a deluded group with ravenous appetites: the more red meat they\u2019ve been thrown \u2013 by David Cameron, then Theresa May, now Boris Johnson \u2013 the fatter and hungrier they\u2019ve got. Each day brings another example of their delusions colliding with reality, yet they only become more fanatical. During the referendum, they told us German car manufacturers would force Merkel to offer Britain a favourable deal. It\u2019s now been revealed that German food producers might not bother exporting food to us after a disorderly exit from the EU because of bottlenecks at ports. The truth is, nothing will ever satisfy these fantasists. Even if the EU scrubbed away the backstop \u2013 an impossibility \u2013 hardcore Brexiteers are already making it clear that wouldn\u2019t be enough. From the very start of this process there has been a failure to report it properly. There has been no acknowledgement that the EU collectively lacks any incentive to offer meaningful concessions based on the Tories\u2019 red lines. Nor that, even if they did, those who have captured the Conservatives\u2019 commanding heights would refuse them. For the next few weeks, a pantomime beckons, with Tory papers breathlessly claiming that Johnson\u2019s British Bulldog resolve compared to May\u2019s timidity has the EU on the back foot, or preparing to surrender, or about to offer sweeping new concessions. It\u2019s all noise. European governments simply want to ensure that the British government squarely takes the blame for what is to pass. Although the EU is far more prepared for no deal, when their member states do indeed suffer an economic shock, their aggrieved voters will not countenance offering Britain meaningful concessions when it is forced, enfeebled, back to the negotiating table. What will the insatiable Brexit fantasists say then? \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

Put the hazelnuts into a food processor and blitz until you have fine crumbs, being careful not to go too far as they will come together and turn into a nut butter. Add the flour and half a teaspoon of flaky sea salt, then pulse a few times so everything is evenly mixed.</p> <p>Add the butter and pulse again until the mix resembles breadcrumbs.

Line a large baking tray with baking paper and drizzle some olive oil into the centre of the paper. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to a circle about 30cm wide and 1cm thick, turning it as you roll to make sure it stays round. Roll it up over the rolling pin and carefully transfer to the prepared baking tray.</p> <p>Spread the goat\u2019s cheese mixture on to the pastry, leaving a 4cm border to fold over later. Top with the figs, being generous as they\u2019ll shrink in the oven slightly.</p> <p>Next, fold the edges of the pastry over the figs to hold them in, brush the edges of the pastry with the beaten egg, then season all over with salt and pepper.</p> <p>Bake for 50 minutes, until golden, scattering over the chopped hazelnuts in the last five minutes of cooking, to toast.

Add the flour and half a teaspoon of flaky sea salt, then pulse a few times so everything is evenly mixed. Add the butter and pulse again until the mix resembles breadcrumbs. Then, with the motor running, add the ice-cold water a tablespoon at a time, until it comes together into a dough. Remove the dough from the processor, flatten into a rough disc, wrap in clingfilm or greaseproof paper and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7. Put the goat\u2019s cheese, honey, herbs, capers, a grind of black pepper, and the lemon zest and juice into the processor and blitz for a few seconds, until creamy and flecked with herbs and capers. Once the pastry has chilled, remove it from the fridge. Line a large baking tray with baking paper and drizzle some olive oil into the centre of the paper. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to a circle about 30cm wide and 1cm thick, turning it as you roll to make sure it stays round. Roll it up over the rolling pin and carefully transfer to the prepared baking tray. Spread the goat\u2019s cheese mixture on to the pastry, leaving a 4cm border to fold over later. Top with the figs, being generous as they\u2019ll shrink in the oven slightly. Next, fold the edges of the pastry over the figs to hold them in, brush the edges of the pastry with the beaten egg, then season all over with salt and pepper. Bake for 50 minutes, until golden, scattering over the chopped hazelnuts in the last five minutes of cooking, to toast. Cool on the baking tray for 10 minutes, then top with the remaining herbs. Serve with lemon-dressed leaves and a few buttered new potatoes. Fig, sweet onion and manchego toasts Plump for the ripest figs you can here \u2013 ideally you want to be able to mash them on to the toast. Prep 15 min Cook 15 min Makes 4 toasts Extra-virgin olive oil 2 red onions, peeled and thinly sliced Salt and black pepper Juice of \u00bd lemon 4 slices sourdough, toasted 1 garlic clove, peeled 4 ripe figs, torn in half 1 small bunch tarragon, leaves picked 100g manchego Heat a frying pan and, once hot, add a little olive oil, then the sliced onions, a good pinch of salt and lemon juice, and cook slowly on a medium heat for around 15 minutes, until soft and sweet. When the onions are ready, toast the bread: I like to do this on a hot griddle. Cut the clove of garlic in half and rub the cut half over one side of each of the toasts, then drizzle with olive oil and season with a little salt. Top with caramelised onions, squish on the torn figs, scatter over the tarragon, season with a little more salt and some black pepper, then shave over the manchego.",

      "body": "<p>My partner hated the idea of having a wedding, until we went to one that changed his mind. There was no church, no patriarchal cliches, no stiff sense of formality. My best friend stood with her husband and his uncle \u2013 their celebrant \u2013 as he married them (unofficially) on a small hillock in the sunshine, while 50 or so of their closest friends and family cried, laughed and sang. \u201cI could actually see us getting married one day, if we can do it like this,\u201d my then boyfriend said to me.</p> <p>He had had a few drinks by that point, but I held him to it. Less than a year later, we shamelessly ripped off their idea. We stood in a field in the middle of a circle formed by our favourite people, as our friend, whom we dubbed \u201cthe rabbi figure\u201d, very, very unofficially married us. (Two months earlier, a real rabbi had done it legally.) Since then, several of our guests have done the same: at one wedding, the celebrant told guests he had once fancied the groom; at another, the celebrant declared, to raucous laughter and applause: \u201cBy absolutely no power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.\u201d</p> <p>Increasing numbers of couples are choosing friends and family as a celebrant: the Wedding Report, which tracks industry data in the US, showed that in 2018, 32% of couples were married by a loved one, a proportion that has more than doubled in under a decade.</p> <p>In the UK, the wedding trends expert Lisa Forde says: \u201cMore and more couples seem to be opting for a register office, then having a loved one marry them on their wedding day.\u201d She suggests several reasons behind this: these couples are less religious; they want their day to feel more personal; and they want to marry in unusual, often outdoor venues (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.forbetterforworse.co.uk/laws.htm\" title=\"\">a civil wedding must take place at a licensed venue under a permanent roof</a>; in Scotland, couples can marry anywhere). Julia Braime, the editor of the bridal magazine Unveiled and the founder of the website <a href=\"https://bridesupnorth.com/\" title=\"\">Brides Up North</a>, agrees; she points to \u201cthe emerging confidence of couples who want to eschew traditional roles\u201d.</p> <p>When the Guardian asked readers to share their experiences of unofficial celebrants, stories came pouring in about ceremonies conducted by friends, siblings, parents, company CEOs, even scout leaders. For some, it is about intimacy: Tom Pearce, 34, asked his sister to do it, saying: \u201cWe worked really hard to make sure that our day was as personal as possible \u2013 to then invite a completely unknown person to perform the most intimate moment seemed to fly in the face of that.\u201d For Fiona Harrison, 47, and her husband, it was a way of recognising the role their closest friends had played in their lives: \u201cNancy and Dave have been with us through everything life throws at people in their nearly-50s: deaths, births, moments of absolute joy. Without them, I doubt we\u2019d have made it through the minefield of our relationship,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But how does a couple decide who will be the right loved one to officiate? And can a wedding that is not legally binding feel as important and meaningful as one that is?</p> <p>Belinda Hanssen, 51, Mike Hanssen, 46, and Michael McVey, 52, met each other through a round-the-world yacht race in 2009. The intensity of Belinda and Mike\u2019s relationship, and the friendship that bonds the couple, who live in Australia, with McVey (as they call him), who lives in Cheshire, was forged in the hard graft, the seclusion \u2013 and, for McVey, the nausea \u2013 of life at sea.</p> <p>McVey raced in the same boat as Belinda. He says: \u201cYou\u2019re spending 24 hours a day in each other\u2019s company. It\u2019s almost like being in a jail cell: you can\u2019t get off; you\u2019re attached at the hip. And during quiet periods of reflection, while you\u2019re on the water, you\u2019ve got nothing else to do but talk. If you add that time together, it\u2019s probably more than you\u2019ve spent with your oldest friend.\u201d It\u2019s a good job, Belinda says, that they share a sense of humour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"590a064514fd9e72c4676f08b5beec52e6d858a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/590a064514fd9e72c4676f08b5beec52e6d858a6/0_435_3056_3819/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michael McVey marries Belinda and Mike Hanssen.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was the honour of a lifetime\u2019: Michael McVey marries Belinda and Mike Hanssen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michelle Henderson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mike\u2019s boat was faster, but he always met the others in the ports along the route, Belinda explains. \u201cIt was quite cute with Mike and me. We\u2019d set sail and email each other once a day, and if I didn\u2019t get an email from him, well, there was hell to pay \u2013 McVey used to get the brunt of that.\u201d Mike laughs, adding: \u201cI always loved getting to port first, waiting for Belinda on the dockside. It was very romantic, providing I didn\u2019t have too many drinks beforehand.\u201d Belinda gives a husky laugh: \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him: he was always there, waiting on the quayside when my boat turned up. Always.\u201d</p> <p>They talked of marriage, but Belinda, who has an adult daughter, says she had to be \u201cvery patient\u201d, as Mike had recently divorced. Almost 10 years after the starting gun was fired, on 30 November 2018, the couple were married by McVey in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/feb/03/48-hours-in-byron-bay\" title=\"\">Byron Bay, Australia</a>. There were only 20 people there to see it: exactly the relaxed, informal atmosphere the couple wanted.</p> <p>Mike says: \u201cWhen it comes to weddings, there are all these standards you\u2019ve got to abide by \u2013 to invite this family, to have that cake \u2013 it gets blown out of all proportion and, before you know it, it has no feeling whatsoever. We went completely the opposite way.\u201d They invited only three guests each, plus partners and children, an official celebrant to make it legal, and their unofficial celebrant, McVey.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn\u2019t want someone we didn\u2019t know marrying us \u2013 I wanted someone who knew the both of us inside out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They all share a vivid memory of Belinda walking, or rather bouncing, down the aisle. From the window of the honeymoon suite where she was getting ready with her daughter and granddaughter, she had watched her husband and friend milling around, looking nervous. She says: \u201cI walked out, almost on a high, really over-the-top happy, and I started singing along to the music, dancing and laughing. And then I saw these two were in tears.\u201d McVey\u2019s voice is thick with emotion as he remembers: \u201cThe day was almost heavy with love and joy \u2013 an experience I don\u2019t believe I will feel again. It was the honour of a lifetime.\u201d He followed a traditional western marriage service, sharing his memories of the couple and then introducing their vows, before declaring: \u201cYou may now kiss the bride!\u201d</p> <p>Belinda says: \u201cMcVey had been there from the very start and our lives have become so entwined. We\u2019ve had umpteen holidays together. His sons stayed with us in Australia and he is godfather to my granddaughter. I didn\u2019t want someone we didn\u2019t know marrying us \u2013 I wanted someone who knew the both of us inside out and could celebrate as much as we were.\u201d</p> <p>There is a moment of quiet as the four of us absorb the emotion, before Belinda laughs her throaty laugh and calls out: \u201cDry your eyes, McVey!\u201d</p> <p>Keya Advani, 34, and Andrew Saunders, 35, met at university in New York. They married in 2014 in Jamaica and then India and now live in London with their one-year-old daughter. Keya says: \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the immigrant experience, to have to find new and innovative ways of being married.\u201d They certainly did that.</p> <p>After they met, the couple lived in the same country for only four months before Andrew moved back to Jamaica, while Keya later moved back to India. Over the following eight years, they spent their savings on flights to see each other. In between, Andrew says, they spoke a lot \u2013 \u201cand I mean a lot. We probably averaged five hours at least a day. Going to sleep in different time zones, we\u2019d say good night on Skype, leave it on and then wake up and talk to each other. So there was a presence in each other\u2019s lives the whole time \u2013 just digitally.\u201d</p> <p>Every day, Lance Rochester, 34, who grew up next door to Andrew in Jamaica and is more family than friend, would walk into Andrew\u2019s house and say: \u201cHi, Keya,\u201d knowing that she would respond \u2013 only on Skype.</p> <p>When Keya and Andrew decided to marry, they wanted to do it in a way that reflected who they are. While Andrew\u2019s parents are religious Christians, he is not. Keya comes from an atheist background, but elements of the Hindu tradition are important to her. Over Skype, they designed two ceremonies rooted in their cultures that also expressed their differences, made up of speeches and blessings from loved ones, including Lance, who says it was meaningful \u201cto be part of sending a message, that they were going to do this as they see fit.\u201d</p> <p>In Jamaica, a week after the legal ceremony, Lance welcomed guests to Keya and Andrew\u2019s wedding and told them that this was not going to be a traditional service. Keya walked down the aisle with her mother. There were speeches from loved ones, then Keya and Andrew read out their vows, which they had written together on Google Docs in different countries, Andrew writing one sentence, Keya the next, as a conversation unfolded between them. Then came the moment when the priest would normally say: \u201cYou may kiss the bride.\u201d Keya says: \u201cI was very conscious about the patriarchal symbolism, and I wanted to challenge that.\u201d So instead it was Keya who declared: \u201cYou may now kiss the bride,\u201d to laughter and cheers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d33a82c4616c389a2e3907d305e4f363961f2bbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d33a82c4616c389a2e3907d305e4f363961f2bbd/1022_0_3744_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Saunders (second left) and Keya Advani (far right) with celebrants Lora and Lance Rochester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Saunders (second left) and Keya Advani (far right) with celebrants Lora and Lance Rochester. \u2018The reason it turned out to be one of the most special days is because of our ceremonies and the people who married us.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shantanu Biswas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Six months later came the Indian wedding. In traditional Hindu ceremonies, Keya explains, the pandit (priest) chants in Sanskrit and lights a fire while the couple walk around it seven times, each circle representing a different aspect of their commitment. For their ceremony, Keya and Andrew identified seven fundamental pillars of their relationship: love, independence, intellect, growth, family, friendship and \u201cthe little things\u201d. They assigned each pillar to a different loved one, who, during the ceremony, spoke about what they felt their pillar meant for the couple, then lit a candle and placed it in a big bowl of water, which Keya and Andrew circled. Finally, the couple exchanged flower garlands, echoing the culmination of the Hindu ceremony.</p> <p>For Andrew, being married by Lance and other friends and family, including Lance\u2019s wife, Lora, was more than just symbolic. \u201cYou get more, what I call, tangled up. Your families have met, they\u2019ve hugged; your friends have met, they\u2019ve begun making their own relationships. So, if you were to separate, there are all those threads trying to hold you together.\u201d</p> <p>For Keya, too, it made their weddings more meaningful. \u201cThere is this rhetoric of your wedding day being the most special day of your life and, for me, it\u2019s like, why? It\u2019s not because I\u2019ve been waiting my whole life to get married \u2013 I didn\u2019t particularly care. The reason it turned out to be one of the most special days is because of our ceremonies and the people who married us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"91dd3eb570546078758ec61dc3b5ecd52f6361e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91dd3eb570546078758ec61dc3b5ecd52f6361e8/1586_471_1374_1718/800.jpg\" alt=\"Claire (far left) and Emma (second left) King-Jones with celebrants Angus Harrison and Lily Eastwood.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire (far left) and Emma (second left) King-Jones with celebrants Angus Harrison and Lily Eastwood. \u2018I had no nerves at all about Lily and Angus.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Le Galle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe made a beeline for me,\u201d says Emma King-Jones from her home in Bath, laughing as she tells how she met her wife, Claire King-Jones, at the school where they taught in 2011. It was soon after that that Emma, 38, from Bath, introduced Claire to her two of her best friends, Angus Harrison, 33, and Lily Eastwood, 31, who live in London. Emma says Claire was \u201cbrilliant, enthusiastic and kind, really interested in the world \u2013 and the love of my life. I\u2019d had a tough time because of a difficult relationship and she really reminded me that life is for living.\u201d Emma proposed in February 2015, on a hike in the Peak District, while they ate their packed lunch looking out over the Hope Valley.</p> <p>They had planned a long engagement, but their plans had to change. In March 2016, Claire was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer. There was hope that treatment would work, but the oncologist advised them to move their wedding forward. Within a month, they were legally married at Bath\u2019s register office, their wedding arranged for May 2016.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The kiss was just hilarious \u2013 you barely waited for Lily to say: \u2018Do you, Claire, take Emma\u2026\u2019 before you started necking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Emma and Claire knew they could trust Lily and Angus to make their wedding a celebration, despite the circumstances. As they planned the ceremony, the celebrants knew they had a huge responsibility to get it right. Lily remembers: \u201cWe wanted everyone to laugh, but we also wanted them to recognise the seriousness of what the day meant. Everyone knew that it potentially wasn\u2019t going to be a long marriage, so it felt even more important to be present, to recognise how special this moment was.\u201d Angus adds: \u201cI just wanted to find out exactly what they wanted from me and then deliver that. That was all I cared about \u2013 it didn\u2019t matter if they wanted me to stand on my head naked; it was going to happen.\u201d Emma laughs and says: \u201cI can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t think to ask you to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Emma was concerned that Claire might feel tired, or that someone would get upset during the day, but says, \u201cI had no nerves at all about Lily and Angus.\u201d The service began with jokes and anecdotes and continued with readings from Claire\u2019s siblings and friends of the couple. \u201cIt was really beautiful,\u201d Emma says, \u201cand there were lots of laughs. I do think it was perfect.\u201d Angus remembers: \u201cThe kiss was just hilarious \u2013 you barely waited for Lily to say: \u2018Do you, Claire, take Emma\u2026\u2019 before you started necking.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly before the wedding, Claire thought her tumour had grown back, but she didn\u2019t tell anyone, including Emma. In July, her oncologist confirmed that the treatment wasn\u2019t helping. Emma stopped working and they spent the rest of their time together. She says: \u201cWe did slightly bonkers things, like moving into a flat in one of the most beautiful roads in Bath, and we bought a puppy, who is asleep on the bed next to me now.\u201d They saw as many friends and family as they could manage.</p> <p>They were married for four and a half months before Claire died in October 2016, aged 32, with Emma beside her.</p> <p>I ask Emma how she is doing. She says: \u201cI\u2019ve built a life for myself. I still miss her every day, constantly, but I have really brilliant friends, these two [Angus and Lily] included. I\u2019ve got lots of people in my life, I\u2019ve got the dog, I\u2019ve got a job that I love. I\u2019m OK. There comes a point with grief where you don\u2019t stop and sit down and think about her, she\u2019s just sort of there. But I do think about the wedding a lot.\u201d Having Lily and Angus as celebrants was, she says, \u201ca sign of how deep the friendship is, because, for the rest of my life, they\u2019ll be the people who married me. It was saying: \u2018You\u2019re friends for life; we\u2019re keeping hold of you.\u2019 It was the most precious thing. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for that day.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "My partner hated the idea of having a wedding, until we went to one that changed his mind. There was no church, no patriarchal cliches, no stiff sense of formality. My best friend stood with her husband and his uncle \u2013 their celebrant \u2013 as he married them (unofficially) on a small hillock in the sunshine, while 50 or so of their closest friends and family cried, laughed and sang. \u201cI could actually see us getting married one day, if we can do it like this,\u201d my then boyfriend said to me. He had had a few drinks by that point, but I held him to it. Less than a year later, we shamelessly ripped off their idea. We stood in a field in the middle of a circle formed by our favourite people, as our friend, whom we dubbed \u201cthe rabbi figure\u201d, very, very unofficially married us. (Two months earlier, a real rabbi had done it legally.) Since then, several of our guests have done the same: at one wedding, the celebrant told guests he had once fancied the groom; at another, the celebrant declared, to raucous laughter and applause: \u201cBy absolutely no power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.\u201d Increasing numbers of couples are choosing friends and family as a celebrant: the Wedding Report, which tracks industry data in the US, showed that in 2018, 32% of couples were married by a loved one, a proportion that has more than doubled in under a decade. In the UK, the wedding trends expert Lisa Forde says: \u201cMore and more couples seem to be opting for a register office, then having a loved one marry them on their wedding day.\u201d She suggests several reasons behind this: these couples are less religious; they want their day to feel more personal; and they want to marry in unusual, often outdoor venues (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a civil wedding must take place at a licensed venue under a permanent roof; in Scotland, couples can marry anywhere). Julia Braime, the editor of the bridal magazine Unveiled and the founder of the website Brides Up North, agrees; she points to \u201cthe emerging confidence of couples who want to eschew traditional roles\u201d. When the Guardian asked readers to share their experiences of unofficial celebrants, stories came pouring in about ceremonies conducted by friends, siblings, parents, company CEOs, even scout leaders. For some, it is about intimacy: Tom Pearce, 34, asked his sister to do it, saying: \u201cWe worked really hard to make sure that our day was as personal as possible \u2013 to then invite a completely unknown person to perform the most intimate moment seemed to fly in the face of that.\u201d For Fiona Harrison, 47, and her husband, it was a way of recognising the role their closest friends had played in their lives: \u201cNancy and Dave have been with us through everything life throws at people in their nearly-50s: deaths, births, moments of absolute joy. Without them, I doubt we\u2019d have made it through the minefield of our relationship,\u201d she says. But how does a couple decide who will be the right loved one to officiate? And can a wedding that is not legally binding feel as important and meaningful as one that is? Belinda Hanssen, 51, Mike Hanssen, 46, and Michael McVey, 52, met each other through a round-the-world yacht race in 2009. The intensity of Belinda and Mike\u2019s relationship, and the friendship that bonds the couple, who live in Australia, with McVey (as they call him), who lives in Cheshire, was forged in the hard graft, the seclusion \u2013 and, for McVey, the nausea \u2013 of life at sea. McVey raced in the same boat as Belinda. He says: \u201cYou\u2019re spending 24 hours a day in each other\u2019s company. It\u2019s almost like being in a jail cell: you can\u2019t get off; you\u2019re attached at the hip. And during quiet periods of reflection, while you\u2019re on the water, you\u2019ve got nothing else to do but talk. If you add that time together, it\u2019s probably more than you\u2019ve spent with your oldest friend.\u201d It\u2019s a good job, Belinda says, that they share a sense of humour. Mike\u2019s boat was faster, but he always met the others in the ports along the route, Belinda explains. \u201cIt was quite cute with Mike and me. We\u2019d set sail and email each other once a day, and if I didn\u2019t get an email from him, well, there was hell to pay \u2013 McVey used to get the brunt of that.\u201d Mike laughs, adding: \u201cI always loved getting to port first, waiting for Belinda on the dockside. It was very romantic, providing I didn\u2019t have too many drinks beforehand.\u201d Belinda gives a husky laugh: \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him: he was always there, waiting on the quayside when my boat turned up. Always.\u201d They talked of marriage, but Belinda, who has an adult daughter, says she had to be \u201cvery patient\u201d, as Mike had recently divorced. Almost 10 years after the starting gun was fired, on 30 November 2018, the couple were married by McVey in Byron Bay, Australia. There were only 20 people there to see it: exactly the relaxed, informal atmosphere the couple wanted. Mike says: \u201cWhen it comes to weddings, there are all these standards you\u2019ve got to abide by \u2013 to invite this family, to have that cake \u2013 it gets blown out of all proportion and, before you know it, it has no feeling whatsoever. We went completely the opposite way.\u201d They invited only three guests each, plus partners and children, an official celebrant to make it legal, and their unofficial celebrant, McVey. They all share a vivid memory of Belinda walking, or rather bouncing, down the aisle. From the window of the honeymoon suite where she was getting ready with her daughter and granddaughter, she had watched her husband and friend milling around, looking nervous. She says: \u201cI walked out, almost on a high, really over-the-top happy, and I started singing along to the music, dancing and laughing. And then I saw these two were in tears.\u201d McVey\u2019s voice is thick with emotion as he remembers: \u201cThe day was almost heavy with love and joy \u2013 an experience I don\u2019t believe I will feel again. It was the honour of a lifetime.\u201d He followed a traditional western marriage service, sharing his memories of the couple and then introducing their vows, before declaring: \u201cYou may now kiss the bride!\u201d Belinda says: \u201cMcVey had been there from the very start and our lives have become so entwined. We\u2019ve had umpteen holidays together. His sons stayed with us in Australia and he is godfather to my granddaughter. I didn\u2019t want someone we didn\u2019t know marrying us \u2013 I wanted someone who knew the both of us inside out and could celebrate as much as we were.\u201d There is a moment of quiet as the four of us absorb the emotion, before Belinda laughs her throaty laugh and calls out: \u201cDry your eyes, McVey!\u201d Keya Advani, 34, and Andrew Saunders, 35, met at university in New York. They married in 2014 in Jamaica and then India and now live in London with their one-year-old daughter. Keya says: \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the immigrant experience, to have to find new and innovative ways of being married.\u201d They certainly did that. After they met, the couple lived in the same country for only four months before Andrew moved back to Jamaica, while Keya later moved back to India. Over the following eight years, they spent their savings on flights to see each other. In between, Andrew says, they spoke a lot \u2013 \u201cand I mean a lot. We probably averaged five hours at least a day. Going to sleep in different time zones, we\u2019d say good night on Skype, leave it on and then wake up and talk to each other. So there was a presence in each other\u2019s lives the whole time \u2013 just digitally.\u201d Every day, Lance Rochester, 34, who grew up next door to Andrew in Jamaica and is more family than friend, would walk into Andrew\u2019s house and say: \u201cHi, Keya,\u201d knowing that she would respond \u2013 only on Skype. When Keya and Andrew decided to marry, they wanted to do it in a way that reflected who they are. While Andrew\u2019s parents are religious Christians, he is not. Keya comes from an atheist background, but elements of the Hindu tradition are important to her. Over Skype, they designed two ceremonies rooted in their cultures that also expressed their differences, made up of speeches and blessings from loved ones, including Lance, who says it was meaningful \u201cto be part of sending a message, that they were going to do this as they see fit.\u201d In Jamaica, a week after the legal ceremony, Lance welcomed guests to Keya and Andrew\u2019s wedding and told them that this was not going to be a traditional service. Keya walked down the aisle with her mother. There were speeches from loved ones, then Keya and Andrew read out their vows, which they had written together on Google Docs in different countries, Andrew writing one sentence, Keya the next, as a conversation unfolded between them. Then came the moment when the priest would normally say: \u201cYou may kiss the bride.\u201d Keya says: \u201cI was very conscious about the patriarchal symbolism, and I wanted to challenge that.\u201d So instead it was Keya who declared: \u201cYou may now kiss the bride,\u201d to laughter and cheers. Six months later came the Indian wedding. In traditional Hindu ceremonies, Keya explains, the pandit (priest) chants in Sanskrit and lights a fire while the couple walk around it seven times, each circle representing a different aspect of their commitment. For their ceremony, Keya and Andrew identified seven fundamental pillars of their relationship: love, independence, intellect, growth, family, friendship and \u201cthe little things\u201d. They assigned each pillar to a different loved one, who, during the ceremony, spoke about what they felt their pillar meant for the couple, then lit a candle and placed it in a big bowl of water, which Keya and Andrew circled. Finally, the couple exchanged flower garlands, echoing the culmination of the Hindu ceremony. For Andrew, being married by Lance and other friends and family, including Lance\u2019s wife, Lora, was more than just symbolic. \u201cYou get more, what I call, tangled up. Your families have met, they\u2019ve hugged; your friends have met, they\u2019ve begun making their own relationships. So, if you were to separate, there are all those threads trying to hold you together.\u201d For Keya, too, it made their weddings more meaningful. \u201cThere is this rhetoric of your wedding day being the most special day of your life and, for me, it\u2019s like, why? It\u2019s not because I\u2019ve been waiting my whole life to get married \u2013 I didn\u2019t particularly care. The reason it turned out to be one of the most special days is because of our ceremonies and the people who married us.\u201d \u201cShe made a beeline for me,\u201d says Emma King-Jones from her home in Bath, laughing as she tells how she met her wife, Claire King-Jones, at the school where they taught in 2011. It was soon after that that Emma, 38, from Bath, introduced Claire to her two of her best friends, Angus Harrison, 33, and Lily Eastwood, 31, who live in London. Emma says Claire was \u201cbrilliant, enthusiastic and kind, really interested in the world \u2013 and the love of my life. I\u2019d had a tough time because of a difficult relationship and she really reminded me that life is for living.\u201d Emma proposed in February 2015, on a hike in the Peak District, while they ate their packed lunch looking out over the Hope Valley.

It has all the boring trappings of a typical Trump story \u2013 gobsmacking ignorance, casual racism, colonialist attitudes towards the treatment of indigenous people, a cold-hearted, transactional view of human life, and ending with him calling a woman in power \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80add426-c3aa-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9\" title=\"\">nasty</a>\u201d. If the news were a binge-worthy drama, this would be a mid-series episode that The AV Club would rate C-: \u201ca worryingly formulaic outing that makes you fear the writers have run out of ideas.\u201d</p> <p>The whole idea was a nonstarter anyway \u2013 Greenland is a proud, independent region. What kind of self-respecting island nation would willingly accept being purchased by the United States? If Trump wants to buy somewhere, he needs to find somewhere that\u2019s been entirely stripped of pride, dignity and joy to the extent that it is now completely incapable of self-governance. A country so humiliated and degraded that it would happily grovel at the feet of an expansionist empire if it just promised the slightest iota of stability.</p> <p>So why doesn\u2019t Trump sack off Greenland and snap up the United Kingdom!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/17/donald-trump-greenland-purchase-denmark\">'Friends, you're going to love Greenland. I was there on 9/11' | Lawrence Douglas and Nancy Pick</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Location</h2> <p>Now, I understand you were initially looking to purchase somewhere in the Arctic Circle area, maybe Canada adjacent, and that Britain is a bit more of a commute than you were hoping for. But just think: every time you fly over to Britain, you\u2019re burning more fossil fuels and melting a bit more arctic ice \u2013 and if you can\u2019t buy Greenland, you might as well drown it. What Britain lacks in rich untapped natural resources, it more than makes up for in four-lane roundabouts and Westfield shopping centres. A lot of first-time buyers overlook Britain because it\u2019s small, wet and currently going through a nationwide nervous breakdown, the scars of which may never fully heal. But hey, that just means it\u2019s a bargain! What you really have to keep in mind is that we are truly, truly desperate. Don\u2019t like the location? No problem! We\u2019ll set up a bunch of heavy-duty outboard motors along the entire east coast of England, from Sunderland to Ipswich, and propel the entire island across the Atlantic Ocean. Sure, we\u2019ll have to barrel through Ireland to get to you, but we\u2019re almost positive they won\u2019t mind. Don\u2019t give them more than a second\u2019s thought \u2013 we haven\u2019t.</p> <h2>Lodgers</h2> <p>There are a few lodgers on the island at the moment, sure \u2013 67,011,618, to be exact. Now, many pseudofascist demagogues looking to buy an island nation get a little nervous when they hear that figure. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 they are surprisingly easy to distract. Sure, they may occasionally get a little worked up over the UK\u2019s frequent human rights abuses, the total collapse of government in their country or the upcoming climate catastrophe, but they\u2019re like magpies \u2013 just dangle something shiny in front of them and it should be fine. Earlier this year they totally forgot about Boris Johnson\u2019s links to far-right figures such as Steve Bannon after being distracted with a story about how he likes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-reveals-he-makes-models-of-buses-to-relax\" title=\"\">paint wine-boxes to look like buses</a>, like some kind of alcoholic TFL conductor. Last month they were all upset about the prospect of no deal, but then that bizarre<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq50F-IDXDc\" title=\"\"> Cats trailer </a>came out and that\u2019s all they\u2019ve talked about since. Seriously, any old nonsense works: get Arron Banks to verbally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/15/arron-banks-jokes-about-greta-thunberg-and-freak-yachting-accidents\" title=\"\">abuse a 16-year-old girl</a>, have someone mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/05/feral-hogs-memes-twitter-30-50-running-into-my-yard-small-kids\" title=\"\">30-50 wild hogs in their back garden</a>, maybe even start a crazy rumour that the president of the United States wants to buy Greenland \u2013 they\u2019ll lap it all up.</p> <h2>Current Condition</h2> <p>I\u2019ll be honest with you: it\u2019s a bit of a fixer-upper, this one. A couple of centuries ago the previous owners did a little extension into the north of the property, but to be frank that\u2019s looking like it\u2019ll collapse at any moment. The south-east of the property is really well-furnished \u2013 too well-furnished, really: all the floors are solid gold, all the counter tops are marble, and instead of loo roll, they use wafer-thin slices of foie gras and compacted caviar. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem if the rest of the property wasn\u2019t falling apart. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 the current owners have a plan to fix this \u2013 they\u2019re building a new high-speed stairlift to make it easier to get to the nice bit of the property even quicker, so that\u2019s something. </p> <h2>Relationship with the Neighbours</h2> <p>We don\u2019t want to talk about it.</p> <h2>The Hard Sell</h2> <p>Look, I can see you\u2019re not exactly sold, so I can do you a deal \u2013 put in an offer, and we\u2019ll throw in Jersey and Gibraltar for free. Think about that for a second \u2013 you\u2019d have your own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/11/gibraltar-barbary-macaques-deported-scottish-safari-park-blair-drummond\" title=\"\">army of monkeys</a> to do your bidding. Yes sir, you could definitely train one to attack Rosie O\u2019Donnell.</p> <p>Yes, of course, take your time obviously, but just to let you know, we have had a couple of other offers coming in as well \u2013 a lovely Saudi crown prince was sniffing around Kensington for a while, and Vladimir Putin was considering purchasing it so he could turn Cornwall into a reserve to hunt the deadliest game (man) \u2026</p> <p>Look, between you and me, the current owner really wants to shift it \u2013 they\u2019re looking to flog it off and then move to somewhere sunny without a tax code or an extradition treaty, so they will consider any offer. Seriously. Any offer.</p> <p>Season 8 of The Apprentice US on DVD and a bucket of chlorinated chicken? Sold.</p> <p>\u2022 Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and occasional performer</p>",

      "bodyText": "People say that news these days is unexpected and baffling, but really could there be a more predictably 2019 story than \u201cDonald Trump wants to buy Greenland\u201d? It has all the boring trappings of a typical Trump story \u2013 gobsmacking ignorance, casual racism, colonialist attitudes towards the treatment of indigenous people, a cold-hearted, transactional view of human life, and ending with him calling a woman in power \u201cnasty\u201d. If the news were a binge-worthy drama, this would be a mid-series episode that The AV Club would rate C-: \u201ca worryingly formulaic outing that makes you fear the writers have run out of ideas.\u201d The whole idea was a nonstarter anyway \u2013 Greenland is a proud, independent region. What kind of self-respecting island nation would willingly accept being purchased by the United States? If Trump wants to buy somewhere, he needs to find somewhere that\u2019s been entirely stripped of pride, dignity and joy to the extent that it is now completely incapable of self-governance. A country so humiliated and degraded that it would happily grovel at the feet of an expansionist empire if it just promised the slightest iota of stability. So why doesn\u2019t Trump sack off Greenland and snap up the United Kingdom! Location Now, I understand you were initially looking to purchase somewhere in the Arctic Circle area, maybe Canada adjacent, and that Britain is a bit more of a commute than you were hoping for. But just think: every time you fly over to Britain, you\u2019re burning more fossil fuels and melting a bit more arctic ice \u2013 and if you can\u2019t buy Greenland, you might as well drown it. What Britain lacks in rich untapped natural resources, it more than makes up for in four-lane roundabouts and Westfield shopping centres. A lot of first-time buyers overlook Britain because it\u2019s small, wet and currently going through a nationwide nervous breakdown, the scars of which may never fully heal. But hey, that just means it\u2019s a bargain! What you really have to keep in mind is that we are truly, truly desperate. Don\u2019t like the location? No problem! We\u2019ll set up a bunch of heavy-duty outboard motors along the entire east coast of England, from Sunderland to Ipswich, and propel the entire island across the Atlantic Ocean. Sure, we\u2019ll have to barrel through Ireland to get to you, but we\u2019re almost positive they won\u2019t mind. Don\u2019t give them more than a second\u2019s thought \u2013 we haven\u2019t. Lodgers There are a few lodgers on the island at the moment, sure \u2013 67,011,618, to be exact. Now, many pseudofascist demagogues looking to buy an island nation get a little nervous when they hear that figure. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 they are surprisingly easy to distract. Sure, they may occasionally get a little worked up over the UK\u2019s frequent human rights abuses, the total collapse of government in their country or the upcoming climate catastrophe, but they\u2019re like magpies \u2013 just dangle something shiny in front of them and it should be fine. Earlier this year they totally forgot about Boris Johnson\u2019s links to far-right figures such as Steve Bannon after being distracted with a story about how he likes to paint wine-boxes to look like buses, like some kind of alcoholic TFL conductor. Last month they were all upset about the prospect of no deal, but then that bizarre Cats trailer came out and that\u2019s all they\u2019ve talked about since. Seriously, any old nonsense works: get Arron Banks to verbally abuse a 16-year-old girl, have someone mention 30-50 wild hogs in their back garden, maybe even start a crazy rumour that the president of the United States wants to buy Greenland \u2013 they\u2019ll lap it all up. Current Condition I\u2019ll be honest with you: it\u2019s a bit of a fixer-upper, this one. A couple of centuries ago the previous owners did a little extension into the north of the property, but to be frank that\u2019s looking like it\u2019ll collapse at any moment. The south-east of the property is really well-furnished \u2013 too well-furnished, really: all the floors are solid gold, all the counter tops are marble, and instead of loo roll, they use wafer-thin slices of foie gras and compacted caviar. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem if the rest of the property wasn\u2019t falling apart. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 the current owners have a plan to fix this \u2013 they\u2019re building a new high-speed stairlift to make it easier to get to the nice bit of the property even quicker, so that\u2019s something. Relationship with the Neighbours We don\u2019t want to talk about it. The Hard Sell Look, I can see you\u2019re not exactly sold, so I can do you a deal \u2013 put in an offer, and we\u2019ll throw in Jersey and Gibraltar for free. Think about that for a second \u2013 you\u2019d have your own army of monkeys to do your bidding. Yes sir, you could definitely train one to attack Rosie O\u2019Donnell. Yes, of course, take your time obviously, but just to let you know, we have had a couple of other offers coming in as well \u2013 a lovely Saudi crown prince was sniffing around Kensington for a while, and Vladimir Putin was considering purchasing it so he could turn Cornwall into a reserve to hunt the deadliest game (man) \u2026 Look, between you and me, the current owner really wants to shift it \u2013 they\u2019re looking to flog it off and then move to somewhere sunny without a tax code or an extradition treaty, so they will consider any offer. Seriously. Any offer. Season 8 of The Apprentice US on DVD and a bucket of chlorinated chicken? Sold. \u2022 Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and occasional performer",

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Bolsonaro slams \u2018sensationalist\u2019 critics despite record wildfires The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has described the wildfire outbreaks in the Amazon rainforest as an international crisis and called for the issue to be tackled at this weekend\u2019s G7 summit. Fires in the Amazon are up 84% on last year and the Brazilian environment minister was booed by protesters at a climate event on Wednesday. But Brazil\u2019s leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has blamed the blazes on environmental groups and said Macron\u2019s \u201csensationalist\u201d comments were made for personal political gain. Alaska. Large fires are still burning in Alaska, where the wildfire season usually ends by the beginning of August. After the hottest July on record, residents of Anchorage are preparing for a future shaped by the climate crisis, writes Elizabeth Harball. California blaze. Almost 4,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in Shasta County in northern California after a fast-moving wildfire broke out on Thursday. Environmental groups suing Trump over endangered species A coalition of environmental groups has launched a federal lawsuit to block the Trump administration\u2019s new interpretation of the 1973 Endangered Species Act, the landmark conservation law credited with saving species including the bald eagle from extinction. The changes would weaken habitat protections and limit consideration of threats to species to the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d, a standard which conservationists say disregards the long-term dangers posed by the climate crisis to creatures such as the Canada lynx. Climate debate quashed. The Democratic National Committee has voted down a proposal to devote one of the party\u2019s dozen 2020 presidential debates exclusively to the issue of climate change. Cheap daily pill reduces risk of heart attacks and strokes A cheap, single pill that combines four common drugs and is designed to be taken daily reduces the risk of heart attacks, stroke and other causes of sudden death in people over the age of 50, a study has concluded. The \u201cpolypill\u201d was trialled among 6,800 participants aged between 50 and 75, over a period of five years in rural Iran, where almost 34% of premature deaths are caused by coronary heart disease, and 14% by strokes. Risk reduction. Published in the Lancet, the study was conducted by researchers from the US, UK and Iran, who found those taking the polypill had a more than 30% lower risk of serious heart problems compared with those who were merely offered medical advice. Employee activism: Google workers latest to lobby bosses More than 1,300 Google workers have signed a petition demanding the firm publicly commit to not provide any material support to government agencies involved in immigrant detention, until those agencies \u201cstop engaging in human rights abuses\u201d. The move coincides with the bidding period for a US Customs and Border Patrol cloud computing contract, which Google could provide. It also marks the latest example of a rise in employee activism: workers lobbying their own bosses over controversial political issues. Business purpose. The bosses of 181 US companies, including Amazon and Apple, recently signed up to a change in the definition of the purpose of a corporation \u2013 to \u201cimproving our society\u201d, rather than \u201cto increase its profits\u201d. Crib sheet Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein were seen at the billionaire sex offender\u2019s apartment in 2010, \u201cgetting foot massages from two young well-dressed Russian women\u201d, according to emails between a US literary agent and the writer Evgeny Morozov. YouTube has disabled more than 200 channels it says were part of a propaganda campaign against pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, as financial observers said they feared the unrest could push the city\u2019s outsized economy into recession. Malaria can be eradicated, but not in the foreseeable future, according to a three-year review of the disease and efforts to control it by experts from the World Health Organization. North Korea has demanded the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, be replaced by a \u201cmore mature\u201d negotiator for the two countries\u2019 denuclearisation talks, with Pyongyang\u2019s top diplomat describing Pompeo as the \u201cdiehard toxin of US diplomacy\u201d.

But when GM abruptly shuttered the plant, cutting the last 1,500 employees from a once-vast workforce, it dealt a heavy blow to a depressed rust-belt town \u2013 and gave the lie to Trump\u2019s promise to return jobs to the midwest, as Adam Gabbatt reports. How Popeyes\u2019 new chicken sandwich conquered the US When the fast-food chain Popeye\u2019s launched its new sandwich \u2013 battered chicken, pickles and sauce on a brioche bun \u2013 it drew long lines and unexpectedly admiring reviews. Matthew Cantor and Charlotte Simmonds ask how social media savvy and consumer disillusionment with Chick-fil-A created a \u201cbona-fried success\u201d.

Is Taylor Swift treading water on her new album?

It takes 20 minutes every morning before I feel my joints are truly working smoothly. I look at the laughter lines on my face in the mirror and mutter: \u201cNothing\u2019s that funny.\u201d In the shower, I can\u2019t turn round enough to perform vital ablutions with ease, and if you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, let me just say enjoy it while you can.</p> <p>I am 45. And a healthy, well-fed, unbowed-by-any-years-of-manual-labour-or-physical-caring-responsibilities 45.

It\u2019s like nobody in the thinktank has ever encountered a human body before. I mean, I was taught all my life that Tories were subhuman (not saying that\u2019s the best way to bring a child up, but on the other hand if you\u2019re raising one in the late 70s and early 80s it does explain a lot of things succinctly for it). After some initial confusion, I realised it was metaphorical, but if they can envisage a population that can work in sufficient numbers in sufficient sectors to bring in the extra \u00a3182bn they reckon this current wheeze will yield, I perhaps should lower myself carefully into a chair and reconsider.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>The contestant lineup for this year\u2019s series of Great British Bake Off has been revealed, and all is as it should be. A tentful of hopefuls, assembled and preparing to reveal to us once more that behind even the most unassuming mien can beat the chantilly-filled, marzipan heart of a patisserie goddess, can lie the spirit of a bread lion (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/29/great-british-bake-off-lion-loaf-crush\">Paul Jagger\u2019s series six creation</a> that lives on in the minds of later generations) or sugar-spinner so adept that his gravity-defying emanations amount to sorcery.</p> <p>I watch GBBO every autumn like a squirrel stores nuts for the winter. I tuck away the little nuggets of goodness that play out on screen every week \u2013 the camaraderie, the striving, the creation of things so much greater than the sum of their parts thanks to ineffable talent, ingenuity and artistry of their makers \u2013 and consume them over the rest of the year to bolster me when the otherwise total arsery of the world threatens to overwhelm.</p> <p>Welcome back, my friends. We have great need of you.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Whenever I think \u2013 or more accurately, am required to think by the exigencies of my job or other external circumstances \u2013 about the sexbot industry, two things always come to mind. First is the famous scene in Portnoy\u2019s Complaint involving the piece of liver. Second is the column Julie Burchill once wrote, in this very newspaper no less, claiming that men would have sex with mud if there was nothing else around and the letter the paper then received from a man who had done exactly that.</p> <p>And I grudgingly admire an industry that has looked at this very low bar and still gone to the trouble of \u2013 uh \u2013 erecting entire robots around it when a box of offal or a rainy day would basically suffice.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/apr/27/rise-of-the-sex-robots-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/6ayvg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3400801\"            data-video-name=\"Rise of the sex robots \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58f74f24e4b05776df18f147\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/04/21/17042sexrobotsv5_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/04/21/17042sexrobotsv5_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/04/21/17042sexrobotsv5.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/apr/27/rise-of-the-sex-robots-video\">Rise of the sex robots</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Jeanette Winterson, however, is not happy.

If we grant that, as claimed, the pills do contain actual Berlin Wall dust instead of \u2013 as with traditional homeopathy \u2013 the mere memory of the \u201cactive\u201d ingredient, does that make it less of a con than usual? Or is the fact that the chicanery is merely transposed \u2013 the memory that does you good now inheres to the stuff itself \u2013 make it even worse?</p> <p>Before you start weeping, though, do let the following comfort you: superfoodies and clean eaters were warned this week that eating too much flax seed puts them at risk of cyanide poisoning.

We don\u2019t take anything short of multiple compound fractures or visible tumours seriously. You crack on. Anyone who merely coughs and splutters is \u2013 ironically \u2013 dead to us. Those who cough, splutter and then moan and groan about the coughing and spluttering and wish to explain how they feel while they are coughing and spluttering, and describe the inner aftermath in minute detail \u2013 these we are in danger of killing with our own hands.</p> <p>Every time I enter the bedroom I am greeted with an update of his symptoms, without a hint of shame or embarrassment.

I am 45. And a healthy, well-fed, unbowed-by-any-years-of-manual-labour-or-physical-caring-responsibilities 45. And yet apparently, according to the Tory thinktank the Centre for Social Justice chaired by diabolical golf ball Iain Duncan Smith, we can and should all be working until well into our 70s. It recommends raising the current pension age from 65 to 70 by 2028 and to 75 by 2035. By that age I will almost certainly be one giant stiffened joint being rolled to and from a garage for industrial lubricant to be applied once a week. The former pensions minister Lady Altmann called the proposal \u201cchilling and immoral\u201d, which is true, but before you even get to that it\u2019s just batshit crazy. It\u2019s like nobody in the thinktank has ever encountered a human body before. I mean, I was taught all my life that Tories were subhuman (not saying that\u2019s the best way to bring a child up, but on the other hand if you\u2019re raising one in the late 70s and early 80s it does explain a lot of things succinctly for it). After some initial confusion, I realised it was metaphorical, but if they can envisage a population that can work in sufficient numbers in sufficient sectors to bring in the extra \u00a3182bn they reckon this current wheeze will yield, I perhaps should lower myself carefully into a chair and reconsider. Tuesday The contestant lineup for this year\u2019s series of Great British Bake Off has been revealed, and all is as it should be. A tentful of hopefuls, assembled and preparing to reveal to us once more that behind even the most unassuming mien can beat the chantilly-filled, marzipan heart of a patisserie goddess, can lie the spirit of a bread lion (see Paul Jagger\u2019s series six creation that lives on in the minds of later generations) or sugar-spinner so adept that his gravity-defying emanations amount to sorcery. I watch GBBO every autumn like a squirrel stores nuts for the winter. I tuck away the little nuggets of goodness that play out on screen every week \u2013 the camaraderie, the striving, the creation of things so much greater than the sum of their parts thanks to ineffable talent, ingenuity and artistry of their makers \u2013 and consume them over the rest of the year to bolster me when the otherwise total arsery of the world threatens to overwhelm. Welcome back, my friends. We have great need of you. Wednesday Whenever I think \u2013 or more accurately, am required to think by the exigencies of my job or other external circumstances \u2013 about the sexbot industry, two things always come to mind. First is the famous scene in Portnoy\u2019s Complaint involving the piece of liver. Second is the column Julie Burchill once wrote, in this very newspaper no less, claiming that men would have sex with mud if there was nothing else around and the letter the paper then received from a man who had done exactly that. And I grudgingly admire an industry that has looked at this very low bar and still gone to the trouble of \u2013 uh \u2013 erecting entire robots around it when a box of offal or a rainy day would basically suffice. Jeanette Winterson, however, is not happy. After researching AI and sexbottery for her latest novel, Frankissstein, she warns that girls and women need to start learning to code and shape the coming world tout de damn suite otherwise the future is likely to be even worse than the past, especially in terms of sexual liberation and satisfaction for women. So, happy hump day, as it were! Thursday Royal-warranted chemist \u2013 though we are about to stretch the meaning of that word to the absolute limits of its elasticity \u2013 Ainsworths is selling homeopathic tablets made of the Berlin Wall as an aid to dealing with emotional trauma. By breaking down the walls we build within ourselves in response to it, do you see? I am consumed by indecision. If we grant that, as claimed, the pills do contain actual Berlin Wall dust instead of \u2013 as with traditional homeopathy \u2013 the mere memory of the \u201cactive\u201d ingredient, does that make it less of a con than usual? Or is the fact that the chicanery is merely transposed \u2013 the memory that does you good now inheres to the stuff itself \u2013 make it even worse? Before you start weeping, though, do let the following comfort you: superfoodies and clean eaters were warned this week that eating too much flax seed puts them at risk of cyanide poisoning. Darwinian justice may yet come to all. Friday \u201cScorn pain,\u201d said Seneca. \u201cEither it will go away or you will.\u201d This is unnecessarily verbose. My husband is ill, and I\u2019ve got it down to \u201cJust go away.\u201d I am the daughter of a doctor. We don\u2019t take anything short of multiple compound fractures or visible tumours seriously. You crack on. Anyone who merely coughs and splutters is \u2013 ironically \u2013 dead to us. Those who cough, splutter and then moan and groan about the coughing and spluttering and wish to explain how they feel while they are coughing and spluttering, and describe the inner aftermath in minute detail \u2013 these we are in danger of killing with our own hands. Every time I enter the bedroom I am greeted with an update of his symptoms, without a hint of shame or embarrassment. I can\u2019t bear it. We wouldn\u2019t blot the escutcheon by articulating our suffering if our lives \u2013 I guess as they one day might \u2013 depended on it. It might be permissible to make a pre-emptive request for the undertaker, but I\u2019d have to check. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a cold fire burning inside me,\u201d he says at one point in the hollow whisper he has adopted for the duration. \u201cI know the feeling,\u201d I say. One of us will not survive the weekend.",

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron reckons he has found the best way of dealing with Donald Trump. It involves acceptance that the US president\u2019s mind will not be changed where a campaign promise is involved. But on everything else \u2013 keep talking. Macron\u2019s method is about to be put to the test once more as Trump arrives on Saturday to join the G7 summit of the world\u2019s major industrialised democracies in Biarritz. So far, the results have been thin at best. It is hard to pinpoint a policy on which the French president changed has his counterpart\u2019s mind, and even before he left Washington Trump was needling his host, accusing Macron of trying to speak for the US in talks with Iran, and falsely claiming that the French president agreed with him that Russia should be readmitted to the club. But Macron has not given up on dialogue. The two leaders spoke early this week for an hour by phone, agreeing that in Biarritz they would discuss \u201call topics, with no taboos\u201d. Macron told reporters this week: \u201cIt\u2019s very simple with President Trump: if he has made a campaign promise, you won\u2019t change his mind. Because his driving force is American politics. I respect and understand that. It\u2019s clear \u2026 your capacity to convince him to go back on them is weak.\u201d The French president said that although \u201cwe don\u2019t think the same things about the world order, or have the same objectives\u201d, the key was to maintain a constant intensity of dialogue with Trump, to avoid disagreements piling up. \u201cMy method is to talk, to say things without compromise, and then to try to take up the points we converge on and not give in on the things we disagree on,\u201d Macron said, noting Trump had visited France more than any other country. Hosting Trump at a multilateral summit is likely to bring special challenges. Such high-level meetings were once seen as a sure way to enhance the reputation of the host nation, but that was in the pre-Trump era. Nowadays summit planning is an exercise in damage limitation. At last year\u2019s G7 in Canada, Trump upset months of difficult negotiation and orchestration with a fit of pique on his way out of the Quebec venue, disowning a consensus communique and denouncing the host, Justin Trudeau, as \u201cdishonest and weak\u201d over some perceived slight. One lesson Macron has drawn from the Quebec fiasco was to do away with a final communique, robbing commentators of an easy benchmark to declare the summit a failure. \u201cOn the main issues we expect the G7 not to produce solutions for everything, not to produce a fully comprehensive statement,\u201d one official said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably one way to avoid the same situation we had in Canada last year.\u201d Lowering expectations is not without its costs. The formal expression of solidarity of the \u201cwestern world\u201d, in the face of crisis and uncertainty, is a principal purpose of G7 summits. In Biarritz there will be a variety of joint statements on different issues such as inequality, the climate crisis, and the global economy on a sliding scale of formality. But such crafty choreography may well not be enough to cover all the cracks in the democratic camp, one gaping fissure in particular. Trump arrives in Biarritz on Saturday in an especially unmoored and cantankerous mood as darkening clouds of recession gather over his re-election bid. He has abruptly called off a state visit to Denmark after its government refused to entertain his proposal it sell Greenland to the US. He has been referring to himself in ever more messianic terms. It has been traditional for the G7 to refer to itself as a \u201cfamily\u201d of nations, but the summit is not some convivial gathering where the dotty uncle can be left in the corner to grumble and rant. Trump heads the world\u2019s biggest economy and its mightiest armed forces. He influences a growing flock of authoritarian leaders around the world who have set themselves up as the counterweight to the pro-trade, pro-democracy ethos that has previously underpinned the G7. If not handled with extreme care, Trump has the power to detonate what remains of \u201cwestern\u201d unity at an increasingly dangerous juncture. Some governments have sought to captivate him through flattery and pandering, and cultivation of the president\u2019s family. Saudi Arabia, Israel, North Korea and China have all treated him like an emperor. Trade tensions have soured the relationship with Beijing, but his red carpet welcome in 2017 has left him convinced he shares a transcendent bond with Xi Jinping. European allies have had less success playing to Trump\u2019s vanity. Despite Trump\u2019s constant jibes on Twitter, Theresa May also tried to win him over with the full pageantry of a state visit, despite his toxic unpopularity in the UK, but he still threw her under a doubledecker bus with the contempt he showed for her desperate efforts to clinch a Brexit deal.

We regularly see the actors themselves \u2013 not stunt doubles \u2013 hoist each other up on to their shoulders, perform daring leaps and impressive suplexes. They hit the canvas hard and simply get up again. But, until season three, the show had rarely explored what those bodies got up to outside the ring \u2013 with the exception of a season one scene featuring Alison Brie that seemed a bit like a cynical way to draw in viewers with the promise of Annie from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/community\">Community</a>\u2019s boobs.</p> <p>In season three, Brie\u2019s boobs are out again, but in a scene infinitely less seedy and depressing than that season one sex scene with her best friend\u2019s husband. This time, her character, Ruth, is trying to cheer up Debbie by donning a showgirl\u2019s headpiece and launching into a terrible dance routine, jiggling her breasts as she and Debbie \u2013 and the audience \u2013 laugh. Female nudity played for comedy is vanishingly rare on screen. Male nudity is regularly played for laughs (and, indeed, GLOW did so with a naked penis in that very episode), but how often are women\u2019s bodies allowed to be anything other than sexual on screen? The scene also served to re-cement the friendship between Ruth and Debbie, so it genuinely was essential to the story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cebe78b665926fc15799ccc18144581b9a0506dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cebe78b665926fc15799ccc18144581b9a0506dc/0_41_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Brie in GLOW season three.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Female nudity played for comedy \u2026 Alison Brie in GLOW season three.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Goldstein/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>GLOW did it again a few episodes later as Tamm\u00e9 (Kia Stevens) eased her aching back in the shower. It depicts the female body as an athlete\u2019s battleground, as Tamm\u00e9 deals with the physical effect wrestling is having on her. The scene is intimate and powerful, quite unlike the usual female shower scenes that invite viewers to watch as detached voyeurs rather than engage empathetically.

      "bodyText": "We have all heard the standard defences: \u201cNudity is empowering!\u201d they say, as the female character pouts silently into the camera, topless for some reason. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to the story!\u201d In its third season, GLOW has actually managed to back up those claims, busting out nudity that is by turns ordinary, funny, realistic and, yes, sexy. Given that it\u2019s set in the world of wrestling, women\u2019s bodies have always been central to GLOW\u2019s stories, although the focus has been more on what those bodies can do than what they look like. We regularly see the actors themselves \u2013 not stunt doubles \u2013 hoist each other up on to their shoulders, perform daring leaps and impressive suplexes. They hit the canvas hard and simply get up again. But, until season three, the show had rarely explored what those bodies got up to outside the ring \u2013 with the exception of a season one scene featuring Alison Brie that seemed a bit like a cynical way to draw in viewers with the promise of Annie from Community\u2019s boobs. In season three, Brie\u2019s boobs are out again, but in a scene infinitely less seedy and depressing than that season one sex scene with her best friend\u2019s husband. This time, her character, Ruth, is trying to cheer up Debbie by donning a showgirl\u2019s headpiece and launching into a terrible dance routine, jiggling her breasts as she and Debbie \u2013 and the audience \u2013 laugh. Female nudity played for comedy is vanishingly rare on screen. Male nudity is regularly played for laughs (and, indeed, GLOW did so with a naked penis in that very episode), but how often are women\u2019s bodies allowed to be anything other than sexual on screen? The scene also served to re-cement the friendship between Ruth and Debbie, so it genuinely was essential to the story. GLOW did it again a few episodes later as Tamm\u00e9 (Kia Stevens) eased her aching back in the shower. It depicts the female body as an athlete\u2019s battleground, as Tamm\u00e9 deals with the physical effect wrestling is having on her. The scene is intimate and powerful, quite unlike the usual female shower scenes that invite viewers to watch as detached voyeurs rather than engage empathetically. Season three focuses a lot on the toll wrestling and performing takes on the body and the mind. They are treated equally seriously, as we see Debbie (Betty Gilpin) and Cherry (Sydelle Noel) worry about what having a child will do to their bodies and careers. Elsewhere, Debbie resorts to bulimia in an attempt to maintain the sort of body that she believes the viewers of their Vegas show want to see. But the nudity in GLOW isn\u2019t all about comedy and empathy \u2013 there is plenty of sex, too, whether its Yolanda and Arthie navigating Arthie\u2019s first lesbian sexual experiences, Debbie working her way through the hotel\u2019s valets with grim determination, or Madison arguing, naked, with a man about which one of them is the prostitute. You could say, perhaps, that the scenes could have been shot coyly, or that characters could have kept their bras on, and indeed that is the case in some scenes.

Gambians living in the diaspora follow it religiously, and some drop by the commission hall in their summer holidays to see the proceedings in person. \u201cIt was a hit in the nation,\u201d said Aisha Jammeh, who has been struggling to sleep since hearing the story of her father\u2019s death. She did not mean that as a compliment. It was \u201cusing our stories\u201d to earn the Gambia undue credit at home and abroad, she thought, and detracting from what victims really wanted: for perpetrators to be brought to justice. \u201cThey could have charged them (the Junglers) when they arrested them two years ago, but they did not charge them \u2013 they were just waiting for the show that is the TRRC.\u201d As for forgiveness for her father\u2019s killers, she said: \u201cIt can\u2019t be that simple. It must be as hard as finding a diamond. Too much is being asked of me. Just forget it and move on? It doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d Additional reporting by Mafuji Ceesay",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The office, located in Srinagar\u2019s Sonwar neighbourhood, was set up in 1949 after the first war between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.

      "body": "<p>This summer I got a new boyfriend, moved into a new flat in Berlin and started a new job \u2013 it was one of the happiest times of my life. One Friday, my partner was having an early night, so a friend came over with a few bottles of wine. Soon I was in the queue for Lab, Berlin\u2019s most notorious men-only Friday night party.</p> <p>I popped a Viagra before leaving the house, because I find it difficult to get an erection if I\u2019ve been drinking (my boyfriend and I are in an open relationship). When I hooked up with a handsome, bearded nurse, I suggested we go back to my place, where he proposed he give me an erection-enhancing injection. I was hesitant. I had tried something similar a few years before; it had hurt a bit and I had stayed hard for longer than I wanted to. But the nurse seemed really keen, so I consented. That was the biggest mistake of my life.</p> <p>I\u2019m squeamish and I hate needles, so I looked away. I can still feel that sudden increase in pressure as the medication entered through the side of my penis. It was uncomfortable, but not painful, and it worked.</p> <p>When I woke, I thought it was strange that I was still so hard. I had had a long-lasting erection before \u2013 called a priapism \u2013 and an ice pack had helped.

I assumed my erection would go down eventually, so I enjoyed the party. </p> <p>At 5am the next morning, I woke with a constant ache in my still very erect penis. I tried painkillers, ice packs and hot baths, but nothing worked. Doctors later told me that the longer your penis stays hard, the wider the scope for lasting damage. Getting help fast is key \u2013 ideally within two to four hours. I had waited more than 30. By 3pm, I was in the street, screaming in agony, waiting for an ambulance.</p> <p>When I got to hospital, I was in more pain than I thought possible. Doctors inserted needles of different shapes and sizes into my penis, sometimes drawing blood out, sometimes flushing out the toxins, once with a curly device that I felt ripping through the tissue, drawing blood in an attempt to bleed out the medication still inside. I was told I had been given a drug usually prescribed for erectile disfunction. I\u2019d had a local anaesthetic, but it didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>It was the darkest time of my life. I had no idea if I would have sex again. I had met the love of my life and was terrified I would lose him. I was too weak to eat or drink and the blood clots were at risk of spreading to my major organs, which could have killed me. Emergency surgery was scheduled for the next morning.</p> <p>Dr Pottek, a reconstructive urological surgeon, performed a procedure under general anaesthetic called the Grayhack shunt: he joined a vein from my leg to the base of my penis to withdraw the trapped blood. It worked, but I had so many blood clots in my penis that it was still hard and very painful. I was given blood-thinning medication intravenously, antibiotics and pain relief in the other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/19/experience-my-dog-is-a-champion-surfer\">Experience: my dog is a champion surfer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I woke, I was no longer in agonising pain.

      "bodyText": "The Lake District is impossibly beautiful, as well as delicious. I spend half my life there, but at times it\u2019s woefully inaccessible. Not \u201cKirkstone Pass in a Vauxhall Rascal with worn-out brakes\u201d inaccessible. No, I mean much of the notable dining and friendly service in the Lakes takes place in ultra-spendy luxury resorts, with a minimum two-night stay, at approximately \u00a3300 per room. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll bring my 83-year-old mother and tween niece for a three-hour, 10-plate chef\u2019s journey of citrus bisque and kohlrabi,\u201d I groan mournfully as weekly news arrives of yet another billion-pound stately home renovation aimed at stressy Zurich hedge-fund managers who want to spend 48 hours blasting haplessly at grouse and having \u00a3200 hot-stone massages. Which is all lovely, but every week I\u2019m in search of a big, reasonably priced and, above all, welcoming place to take normal folk; one in fact like The Yan at Broadrayne. Somewhere that serves rustic stuff with finesse, but not too much finesse: Cumberland sausage, bowls of buttery mash, sticky toffee pudding or even just a rack of toast with local jams. Somewhere like The Yan that\u2019s open more than 20 hours per week and serves sweet things that appear to be made from scratch, not bought at the local Pioneer food store and thawed out. Somewhere the staff are jolly and not broken by 20 coaches of Beatrix Potter fans every day. \u201cAre you going to ruin this place for us by talking about it?\u201d my brother sighs midway through demolishing one of The Yan\u2019s sharing boards of home-smoked thyme and garlic beef brisket. We\u2019re sitting in a large, carefully restored outbuilding, near the open kitchen, watching chef Will Manley as he dishes up piles of fresh golden onion rings, mini baked potatoes stuffed with garlic butter, grilled corn on the cob, homemade coleslaw. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to tell readers,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty,\u2019 I add, as if I work for MI5, rather than write about tarte tatin with cinnamon whipped cream \u2013 available here \u2013 for a living. But it does hurt my heart to reveal these things; like whenever I speak of places such as Syke Farm Tea Room at Buttermere, The Drunken Duck at Barngates or Baba Ganoush in Kendal. These places are tiny and special, and all of the world wants to visit the Lakes. There\u2019s a reason Rome has finally cracked and begun asking tourists to curb their enthusiasm. The Yan sits near Grasmere, where millions stop each year to buy gingerbread. It\u2019s close to Helm Crag, which boasts a formation of rocks at the top that resembles (if you squint) a lion nurturing a lamb, or a woman playing a grand piano. This is very exciting the first time you see it as a Cumbrian child, and, although it perhaps fades with the 789th viewing, you never quite numb to the hulking majesty of this landscape. Broadrayne Farm sits above what would have been the flood plain of the valley. The name can be traced back to Norse language and translates as broad \u201crein\u201d (long strip).

As it is 50 years since the start of the Troubles and, as the backstop is so topical, I thought I would send six films to you at Downing St that clarify why all this matters. Maybe you could watch them on a flight or train journey somewhere?</p> <h2><strong>Angel (1982)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0RSD0mWIVI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z0RSD0mWIVI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A film about a gentle saxophonist who plays music in south Armagh, near the border; an elegiac world of rural ballrooms, neon lights and idealised love. He is apolitical, more into Stan Getz than guns, but he witnesses a murder and, as a result, becomes violent himself. Your father said on TV recently that if the Irish want to kill each other, they will, no matter the political framework. Neil Jordan\u2019s Angel shows the opposite \u2013 we\u2019re not natural-born killers. The political framework matters. You, Boris, are not the picture: you are the frame.</p> <h2><strong>You, Me and Marley (1992)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ3Xhi6xcc8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PJ3Xhi6xcc8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A TV drama written by a working-class protestant, Graham Reid, about five wild and reckless Belfast teenagers \u2013 you\u2019ll identify with their wildness, I think. Again, this is not very political; it is more Dionysus than DUP.

      "bodyText": "Dear Boris Johnson, I\u2019m a Northern Irish film-maker, living in Scotland. I have never been great at words, but have learned a lot about life through film. As it is 50 years since the start of the Troubles and, as the backstop is so topical, I thought I would send six films to you at Downing St that clarify why all this matters. Maybe you could watch them on a flight or train journey somewhere? Angel (1982) A film about a gentle saxophonist who plays music in south Armagh, near the border; an elegiac world of rural ballrooms, neon lights and idealised love. He is apolitical, more into Stan Getz than guns, but he witnesses a murder and, as a result, becomes violent himself. Your father said on TV recently that if the Irish want to kill each other, they will, no matter the political framework. Neil Jordan\u2019s Angel shows the opposite \u2013 we\u2019re not natural-born killers. The political framework matters. You, Boris, are not the picture: you are the frame. You, Me and Marley (1992) A TV drama written by a working-class protestant, Graham Reid, about five wild and reckless Belfast teenagers \u2013 you\u2019ll identify with their wildness, I think. Again, this is not very political; it is more Dionysus than DUP. But if you have 84 minutes, watch it because it might help you see the north of Ireland, its similarities to Leeds or Cork or Runcorn, and also its differences. There are only 400 miles between where you live and Belfast but, be honest, the psychological distance is far further. A Mother Brings Her Son to Be Shot (2017) A lovely doc, filmed over many years. It is set in Derry, where Lyra McKee was killed, and features a lad called Kevin Barry. Listen to what he says, Boris.

It\u2019s a message, delivered with quiet reflection over gospel keys on the tape\u2019s tender title track, that grows more resonant with each song that follows. Music X Road, his sixth mixtape since 2014 debut Headz or Tails, is an artist evolution documenting a personal one. Atop beats that frequently transcend the trademark murk, menace and bass tremors of the genre he\u2019s come to lead, Adjei hits new heights of introspection, ripping back the curtain with fearlessness and flair on his experience as a Broadwater Farm estate youngster trying to find his footing.</p> <p>Claustrophobia and regret sit like a smog across its entire 45-minute runtime. \u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want me to joke, baby I\u2019m doing a wrong \u2019un I know / I do some things in the street, the things that you hear I know you can\u2019t condone,\u201d he raps on Home, a song about balancing family life with days on the road, interspersed with Bon Iver-like Auto-Tuned vocal moans. Stefflon Don, Krept &amp; Konan, Skepta and Dave drop in for welcome cameos, but Music X Road is most enthralling when Adjei is alone in his thoughts. Lead single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbUQG-qgdtg\">Both</a>, which turns Ultra Nat\u00e9\u2019s 90s smash Free into a stark, guitar-led moment of melancholy, looks back on his stints in prison for drug-dealing (\u201cJailhouse, scrambling eggs in a kettle, just wishing I could have it with toast\u201d) and seems to wonder if he\u2019s any more free now than then, in a Tottenham over-policed by \u201cfeds [trying to] draw me out\u201d. Chanel is a delicate float of piano and strings, while Nearly Died fires back at the tabloid scaremongering that has plagued drill over the last 12 months: \u201cI don\u2019t glamourise jail / Them lonely nights, they were shit.\u201d Adjei approaches Music X Road with a Dave-like determination to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/05/headie-one-review-gorilla-manchester-drill-mc\">tell uncomfortable truths</a>: about life in a London where services have been ruthlessly cut, and where inner demons lurk, waiting to take over.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I had to focus on growth, you know,\u201d confides Irving Adjei early into Music X Road, his latest mixtape as drill hopeful Headie One. It\u2019s a message, delivered with quiet reflection over gospel keys on the tape\u2019s tender title track, that grows more resonant with each song that follows. Music X Road, his sixth mixtape since 2014 debut Headz or Tails, is an artist evolution documenting a personal one. Atop beats that frequently transcend the trademark murk, menace and bass tremors of the genre he\u2019s come to lead, Adjei hits new heights of introspection, ripping back the curtain with fearlessness and flair on his experience as a Broadwater Farm estate youngster trying to find his footing. Claustrophobia and regret sit like a smog across its entire 45-minute runtime. \u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want me to joke, baby I\u2019m doing a wrong \u2019un I know / I do some things in the street, the things that you hear I know you can\u2019t condone,\u201d he raps on Home, a song about balancing family life with days on the road, interspersed with Bon Iver-like Auto-Tuned vocal moans. Stefflon Don, Krept &amp; Konan, Skepta and Dave drop in for welcome cameos, but Music X Road is most enthralling when Adjei is alone in his thoughts. Lead single Both, which turns Ultra Nat\u00e9\u2019s 90s smash Free into a stark, guitar-led moment of melancholy, looks back on his stints in prison for drug-dealing (\u201cJailhouse, scrambling eggs in a kettle, just wishing I could have it with toast\u201d) and seems to wonder if he\u2019s any more free now than then, in a Tottenham over-policed by \u201cfeds [trying to] draw me out\u201d. Chanel is a delicate float of piano and strings, while Nearly Died fires back at the tabloid scaremongering that has plagued drill over the last 12 months: \u201cI don\u2019t glamourise jail / Them lonely nights, they were shit.\u201d Adjei approaches Music X Road with a Dave-like determination to tell uncomfortable truths: about life in a London where services have been ruthlessly cut, and where inner demons lurk, waiting to take over. It\u2019s an impressive, captivating coming of age.",

Halcyon days and no mistake. Well, almost nine years after her last album, Natasha\u2019s back with a one-off live show ahead of her anticipated fourth album, Roll With Me.

This hybrid work \u2013 part cantata, part symphonic poem \u2013 sets passages from Milton\u2019s masque in a score that juxtaposes passages of lush, sensuous beauty with moments of intense physical excitement. But despite its initial success, performances have remained rare; this revival by Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra \u2013 as part of an all-British programme that also includes Elgar\u2019s choral work, The Music Makers \u2013 is not be missed. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/bbc-proms-2019/prom-53-the-music-makers/\">Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Thursday 29 August</a></em></p> <h2>Babylon Suite</h2> <p>The visit to the Proms by Orchestre de Paris and its director Daniel Harding gives UK audiences a first chance to hear something of J\u00f6rg Widmann\u2019s debut opera, premiered in Munich in 2012. Babylon is a modern retelling of the story of the ancient Mesopotamian kingdom, the Tower of Babel that was built there and the chaos that followed, before order is finally imposed. In the orchestral suite, says Widmann: \u201cYou can hear a linguistic confusion ... which could only be heard in Babylon, and which can be heard today.\u201d <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/bbc-proms-2019/prom-50-orchestre-de-paris/\">Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Monday 26 August</a></em></p> <h2>Cabildo</h2> <p>Amy Beach, who died in 1944 at the age of 77, is generally recognised as the US\u2019s first significant female composer, and one of the first to have trained entirely in her home country, where her music is performed far more regularly than on this side of the Atlantic. Beach\u2019s only opera, completed in 1932 but never performed in her lifetime, gets a rare British staging this week as part of Grimeborn 2019, directed by Emma Jude Harris. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/cabildo/\">Arcola Theatre, E8, Thursday 29 to 31 August</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e07a1b98dfee06188b4e52d63a2afd829a69ad2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e07a1b98dfee06188b4e52d63a2afd829a69ad2/0_57_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damien Hirst\u2019s Myth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damien Hirst\u2019s Myth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates/\u00a9 Damien Hirst and Science Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Damien Hirst</h2> <p>You cannot ignore Hirst\u2019s big painted bronze statues that show people and animals inside out.

Ignore his Mona Lisa, even. Those paintings only hint at the breadth of his mind. The most intimate encounter you can have with the Renaissance polymath who died 500 years ago is to get close to his drawings, and this exhibition offers a superb selection.

Its exploration of gender-fluid creativity since the 1960s is full of images that feel essential \u2013 because the identity of the artist is in them. From the literally self-centred soft pornography of French pioneer Pierre Molinier to the moving portraits of Catherine Opie, it\u2019s a carnival of provocation and courage. The work of Luciano Castelli \u2013 art\u2019s answer to glam rock in the 70s \u2013 is especially stunning. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/130821-kiss-my-genders-2019\">Hayward Gallery, SE1, to 8 September</a></em></p> <h2>Top Secret</h2> <p>GCHQ has opened its archives for this survey of cyphers, code breaking and spying since the first world war, so don\u2019t expect a radical critique of the security state.

Her writing is always theatrically explosive and deeply considered, playful yet profound.

But Simon Woods\u2019s new work sounds interesting. It is set in the late 80s and is about a Tory politician and his wife of 30 years whose blissful marriage isn\u2019t nearly as idyllic as it seems.

The Entertainer originally took place in the 50s but O\u2019Connor has relocated the story about a fading musical hall entertainer to the 80s, against the backdrop of the Falklands war.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Pain and Glory (15) (Pedro Almod\u00f3var, 2019, Spa) 113 mins After a series of minor-key works, Almod\u00f3var returns with a bang with this poignant, semi-autobiographical study of a film director on the verge. Antonio Banderas plays Salvador Mello, the Spanish auteur\u2019s proxy, whose career is on hiatus while he comes to terms with back pain and depression \u2013 forcing him to reflect on the highs and lows of his past. Hail Satan? (15) (Penny Lane, 2019, US) 95 mins The question mark is vital to this study of the Satanic Temple, a nontheistic religious group co-founded in 2013 by the sardonic Lucien Greaves. While appearing to promote satanic worship, the temple is more of a situationist prankster set-up, with designs on keeping the separation of church and state in an increasingly right-wing, evangelical America. Transit (12A) (Christian Petzold, 2018, Ger/Fra) 102 mins Since 2000, Germany\u2019s Christian Petzold has been steadily carving out a solid and diverse body of work. His latest might possibly be his best, a hauntingly strange and subversive updated adaptation of Anna Seghers\u2019s 1942 novel \u2013 a WW2 movie in modern dress \u2013 that sees a German refugee (Franz Rogowski) assuming a dead man\u2019s identity in a bid to flee occupied France. Blinded By the Light (12A) (Gurinder Chadha, 2019, UK) 117 mins Journalist Sarfraz Manzoor\u2019s memoir Greetings from Bury Park: Race, Religion and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll is the loose inspiration for this story of a British-born teen from a Pakistani family whose ascent into adulthood is precipitated by the discovery of Bruce Springsteen. The musical numbers are often cheesy, and the period detail is full-on 80s kitsch, but newcomer Viveik Kalra makes a charming, guileless lead. Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood (18) (Quentin Tarantino, 2019, US) 161 mins Tarantino\u2019s surprise box-office hit finds the director telling the interweaving stories of TV western star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), his stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) and neighbour Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Sparks fly in the controversial climax, but it\u2019s a freewheeling trip through Hollywood life in 1969, before Nixon, Vietnam and Charles Manson took the city\u2019s innocence away. DW Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop One Africa Music Fest Back for a third year, London\u2019s celebration of all things Afrobeats offers up a stellar lineup of the genre\u2019s best exponents including pop crossover Stefflon Don , whose varied career has seen her work with everyone from the likes of Wiley to Craig David and Halsey. Other performers on the night include Burna Boy, Sneakbo, 2Face and Kojo Funds. The SSE Arena, Wembley, Saturday 24 August Manchester Psych Fest Promising to bring together \u201cthe strange, the far out, and the open minded\u201d, this Manchester-based festival is a celebration of excess both musically, sartorially and in terms of hairstyles. Courtney Barnett, Temples and Goat Girl are the big-ish names, but keep an eye and ear out for the excellently monikered Bonnacons of Doom. Various venues, Manchester, Saturday 24 August End of the Road Nope, even though it seemed to start nine months ago, festival season isn\u2019t over yet. The last of the major, possibly rain-sodden music showcases in the UK returns with an eclectic lineup ranging from pop oddballs Metronomy, to purveyors of spaced-out epics Spiritualized and alt-R&amp;B maverick Serpentwithfeet. There\u2019s also an area called Healing Gardens, in case it all gets too much. Salisbury, Thursday 29 August to 1 September Natasha Bedingfield Who can forget the time when pop was ruled by Bedingfields Daniel and Natasha? Halcyon days and no mistake. Well, almost nine years after her last album, Natasha\u2019s back with a one-off live show ahead of her anticipated fourth album, Roll With Me. Further proof of its time capsule-like quality comes with the fact it was produced by early 00s angst enabler Linda Perry. Still, Unwritten was amazing, wasn\u2019t it? Islington Assembly Hall, N1, Wednesday 28 August MC Louis Moholo-Moholo\u2019s Five Blokes South African drumming legend Louis Moholo-Moholo\u2019s nonchalant moniker for his Five Blokes band disguises the exhilarating power and soul of their hard-grooving energies and uncanny collective spirit.

Elsewhere in north London, Arsenal have told <strong>Shkodran Mustafi</strong> and <strong>Mohamed Elneny</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/22/arsenal-unai-emery-shkodran-mustafi-mohamed-elneny-european-transfer-window\">sling their respective hooks</a> before the European transfer window closes next week, or face prolonged periods of footballing inactivity. \u201cThey are very big players but for one circumstance or another they are going to have fewer chances to show their capacity or to be happy with us and the minutes they play in matches,\u201d said Unai Emery. Mustafi has attracted interest from <strong>Monaco</strong>, while a number of Turkish S\u00fcper Lig clubs are believed to be hitching their skirts at Elneny.</p> <p>Following the departure of <strong>Islam Slimani</strong> for <strong>Monaco</strong> on a season-long loan earlier this week, his former Leicester City teammate <strong>Adrien Silva</strong> is about to join him on the French Riviera. Eager to further reduce numbers in his squad, Brendan Rodgers also hopes to offload winger <strong>Rachid Ghezzal</strong> and midfielder <strong>Fousseni Diabat\u00e9 </strong>before the end of the month.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for the likes of Diabat\u00e9 and Rachid because there are players in front of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be, in the next few weeks, opportunities for these guys to go [somewhere else] and play.\u201d</p> <p>Brazilian winger <strong>Kenedy</strong> is exploring his options, having dropped below Pedro, Christian Pulisic, Willian, Callum Hudson-Odoi and the person who makes the half-time tea in the Chelsea pecking order. Despite featuring prominently in Chelsea\u2019s pre-season games, the 23-year-old did not make the bench for last weekend\u2019s match against Leicester. Midfielder <strong>Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko</strong> is also expected to leave Stamford Bridge, although negotiations over a season-long loan move to Monaco are reported to be at an impasse.</p> <p>Inter\u2019s hopes of securing <strong>Arturo Vidal</strong> from Barcelona on loan appear to have been dashed by the revelation that the Spanish champions want to sell the Chilean midfielder. Any money they raise from hawking him around will presumably go towards funding the latest bid for <strong>Neymar</strong> that <strong>Barcelona</strong> news outlet Sport say is in the pipe. While it remains to be seen whether the Brazilian goes to Bar\u00e7a or Real Madrid, his current employers, <strong>PSG</strong>, seem hell-bent on signing Juventus striker <strong>Paulo Dybala</strong> as his replacement.</p> <p>And finally, rumours that <strong>Marcos Rojo</strong> is on the verge of moving to <strong>Fenerbahce</strong> appear to have been greatly exaggerated, as a spokesman for the Turkish club has insisted they are not interested in signing the Manchester United defender.</p>",

Llorente, a free agent since being released by Tottenham in June, has also been linked with moves to Serie A clubs Napoli and Lazio. Victor Wanyama is another player who is surplus to requirements at Tottenham, who are still busy negotiating the midfielder\u2019s sale to Belgian side Club Brugge. Elsewhere in north London, Arsenal have told Shkodran Mustafi and Mohamed Elneny to sling their respective hooks before the European transfer window closes next week, or face prolonged periods of footballing inactivity. \u201cThey are very big players but for one circumstance or another they are going to have fewer chances to show their capacity or to be happy with us and the minutes they play in matches,\u201d said Unai Emery. Mustafi has attracted interest from Monaco, while a number of Turkish S\u00fcper Lig clubs are believed to be hitching their skirts at Elneny. Following the departure of Islam Slimani for Monaco on a season-long loan earlier this week, his former Leicester City teammate Adrien Silva is about to join him on the French Riviera. Eager to further reduce numbers in his squad, Brendan Rodgers also hopes to offload winger Rachid Ghezzal and midfielder Fousseni Diabat\u00e9 before the end of the month. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for the likes of Diabat\u00e9 and Rachid because there are players in front of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be, in the next few weeks, opportunities for these guys to go [somewhere else] and play.\u201d Brazilian winger Kenedy is exploring his options, having dropped below Pedro, Christian Pulisic, Willian, Callum Hudson-Odoi and the person who makes the half-time tea in the Chelsea pecking order. Despite featuring prominently in Chelsea\u2019s pre-season games, the 23-year-old did not make the bench for last weekend\u2019s match against Leicester. Midfielder Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko is also expected to leave Stamford Bridge, although negotiations over a season-long loan move to Monaco are reported to be at an impasse. Inter\u2019s hopes of securing Arturo Vidal from Barcelona on loan appear to have been dashed by the revelation that the Spanish champions want to sell the Chilean midfielder. Any money they raise from hawking him around will presumably go towards funding the latest bid for Neymar that Barcelona news outlet Sport say is in the pipe. While it remains to be seen whether the Brazilian goes to Bar\u00e7a or Real Madrid, his current employers, PSG, seem hell-bent on signing Juventus striker Paulo Dybala as his replacement. And finally, rumours that Marcos Rojo is on the verge of moving to Fenerbahce appear to have been greatly exaggerated, as a spokesman for the Turkish club has insisted they are not interested in signing the Manchester United defender.",

      "bodyText": "One of Zimbabwe\u2019s best-known comedians and political satirists is in hiding after being abducted from her home by unidentified armed men, then beaten, stripped and made to drink sewage. The attack on Samantha Kureya is one of a series in recent weeks targeting critics of President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling Zanu-PF party. Human rights activists believe Zimbabwe\u2019s security services are responsible. Kureya, who is known as Gonyeti and appears for the irreverent Bustop TV, said men who identified themselves as police officers knocked at the door of her Harare home at about 9pm on Wednesday. Three men wearing masks forced their way in and slapped the comedian, who was in her underwear, then forced her into an Isuzu pick-up truck. The same vehicle has reportedly been involved in many of the 10 similar incidents \u2013 six in Harare and four in Bulawayo \u2013 reported to human rights activists in the last week. Tensions are running high in Zimbabwe. Last week, police broke up an opposition rally in Harare, the capital, with baton charges and teargas. The protest, against ongoing austerity measures aimed at staving off economic collapse, had been banned by authorities. There were reports on Thursday night that a senior official from the Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition party, had been detained for organising illegal demonstrations. Two further MDC protests in provincial cities were banned earlier this week. Kureya said she was driven by her abductors to \u201can unknown place\u201d. \u201cThey started saying: \u2018You mock the government and we have been monitoring you\u2019. They told me to lie down and instructed me to start rolling on the ground. They would instruct me to roll from either side and each time I did, I would get beaten. They started stomping on my back,\u201d the 33-year-old said. The men made the her perform army drills and ordered her to drink water contaminated with raw sewage, before asking questions about her partner, the offices of the TV company she works for and her colleagues. They then told her to strip and smashed her phone with an AK-47 assault rifle. Earlier this year, Kureya was one of two comedians arrested for public nuisance after appearing in a comic sketch wearing a police uniform. \u201cThey said: \u2018If you report this case, we will put a bullet in your mother\u2019s skull\u2019. We are not safe in this country, it\u2019s scary. If men like that come and abduct a woman like me with guns, it\u2019s scary,\u201d she said on Thursday, speaking from a secret location where she is receiving medical care. Relatives were also assaulted during the abduction, with beatings taking place in front of children. Authorities in Zimbabwe have faced criticism from the EU, US and UK over the crackdown on protests and the reports of abuses. \u201cOnly by addressing concretely [and] rapidly these human rights violations will the government of Zimbabwe give credibility to its commitments to address longstanding governance challenges,\u201d said Andrew Stephenson, the British minister for Africa. Mnangagwa has responded to the criticism by underlining the importance of the rule of law in Zimbabwe. \u201cThe rule of law observance is not needed for the purposes of pleasing other countries, we need it because it is proper for ourselves \u2026 The [current government] has brought about enhanced democratic space, it is for the good of our people. The few who abuse the democratic space, the rule of law will apply,\u201d the president told a civil society meeting. Energy Mutodi, the deputy information minister, said Kureya had done \u201ca comedy \u2026 on abductions\u201d. \u201cWe will not be fooled,\u201d he said. The government is trying to mend relations with the west after decades of isolation over human rights abuses under Robert Mugabe, who was ousted in a military-led coup in 2017. Mnangagwa won contested elections last year with a pledge to revive the country\u2019s economy. But many Zimbabweans say things have gone from bad to worse with shortages of bread, fuel and medicines. Inflation is running at triple figures. According to the UN, about 5 million Zimbabweans, or a third of the population, need food aid. The country is crippled by massive debts incurred during Mugabe\u2019s rule and needs a multibillion-dollar bailout to prevent economic collapse. However, the continuing repression and a lack of tangible political reform means there is little chance of international institutions offering major aid packages. Though most of the several hundred people detained during unrest in January have been released, 21 activists, opposition leaders and trade unionists are facing subversion charges that could lead to lengthy sentences.",

      "body": "<p>Some of the largest themes have been addressed in the shortest books. That is especially true in the realm of what might be called political fiction. The single best evocation of communism \u2013 and especially the distance between the ideal and the Soviet reality \u2013 remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeorwell\">George Orwell</a>\u2019s brief allegory, <em>Animal Farm</em>. In the same way, few works have conveyed the brutal nature of imperialism more effectively than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/josephconrad\">Joseph Conrad</a> managed in fewer than a hundred pages in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jul/29/journeys-in-literature-heart-of-darkness-by-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">Heart of Darkness</a></em>. A third place in that small space on the shelf could be allocated to an even briefer work: <em>Address Unknown</em>, a story so short it can be read on a morning bus ride. Yet somehow it distils the essence of the ideology that, along with the other two, casts a deathly shadow over the 20th century. Across a few economic pages it touches the heart of the Nazi darkness.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/13/featuresreviews.guardianreview18\">Address Unknown</a></em> was first published in Story magazine in September 1938, and then in book form a year later, becoming an instant bestseller. It has been translated across the world, adapted into a 1944 film and into multiple productions for the stage and radio \u2013 all under the name of Kressmann Taylor, after Story\u2019s editor, along with Kathrine Kressmann Taylor\u2019s husband, Elliott, decided it was \u201ctoo strong to appear under the name of a woman\u201d. The impact was immediate, the story credited with having \u201cjolted America\u201d, alerting it to the horror unfolding in Nazi Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c21154d6f0c7a78ee43d8bed77a49fd74c48b0fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c21154d6f0c7a78ee43d8bed77a49fd74c48b0fa/175_72_709_983/361.jpg\" alt=\"Address unknown novel cover\" width=\"361\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It consists of nothing more than an intermittent correspondence between two friends. Yet the epistolary form is deceptively efficient, supplying backstory, plot, character, dialogue and more than one narrative voice before a conventional novel might have cleared its throat.

      "bodyText": "Some of the largest themes have been addressed in the shortest books. That is especially true in the realm of what might be called political fiction. The single best evocation of communism \u2013 and especially the distance between the ideal and the Soviet reality \u2013 remains George Orwell\u2019s brief allegory, Animal Farm. In the same way, few works have conveyed the brutal nature of imperialism more effectively than Joseph Conrad managed in fewer than a hundred pages in Heart of Darkness. A third place in that small space on the shelf could be allocated to an even briefer work: Address Unknown, a story so short it can be read on a morning bus ride. Yet somehow it distils the essence of the ideology that, along with the other two, casts a deathly shadow over the 20th century. Across a few economic pages it touches the heart of the Nazi darkness. Address Unknown was first published in Story magazine in September 1938, and then in book form a year later, becoming an instant bestseller. It has been translated across the world, adapted into a 1944 film and into multiple productions for the stage and radio \u2013 all under the name of Kressmann Taylor, after Story\u2019s editor, along with Kathrine Kressmann Taylor\u2019s husband, Elliott, decided it was \u201ctoo strong to appear under the name of a woman\u201d. The impact was immediate, the story credited with having \u201cjolted America\u201d, alerting it to the horror unfolding in Nazi Germany. It consists of nothing more than an intermittent correspondence between two friends. Yet the epistolary form is deceptively efficient, supplying backstory, plot, character, dialogue and more than one narrative voice before a conventional novel might have cleared its throat. Within a page or two, we are in the world of Martin and Max, both German, the latter a Jew now living in San Francisco, the former now back in Munich \u2013 two men who have been business partners, friends and whose families have, as we shall discover, been intimately connected. Their exchange, spanning just 16 months between 1932 and 1934, illuminates not just the specific texture of the early Nazi period, but something more timeless. It serves as a guide to the way any politics of identity \u2013 especially one that invokes \u201cthe people\u201d, rooting that idea in blood and soil \u2013 eventually, and often very rapidly, divides and polarises. Max and Martin have shared \u201cthe fireside\u201d, there finding \u201cwarmth and understanding, where small selfishnesses are impossible and where wine and books and talk give a different meaning to existence\u201d. But even the very best of friends can be rent apart. Once a dividing line is drawn, it\u2019s astonishing how swiftly people can break from those who stand on the other side of it. In that sense, Address Unknown is a warning. We tell ourselves, as these characters do, that friendship is eternal, that some bonds will never be broken. This short story warns us that ideology, once it has turned to fever, is stronger than friendship. That\u2019s because any total, all-consuming creed will first separate \u201cus\u201d from \u201cthem\u201d, and then separate \u201cthem\u201d from the rest of the human family. Dehumanisation has been the overture to every genocidal opera (though it\u2019s worth stressing that Taylor was writing in 1938, before the Nazis\u2019 \u201cfinal solution to the Jewish problem\u201d was under way).

The antisemitism that comes out of Martin\u2019s mouth \u2013 \u201cThe Jewish race is a sore spot to any nation that harbours it\u201d \u2013 thus shocks not because we don\u2019t expect a German in 1933 to be expressing anti-Jewish racism, but because it is expressed by one man towards another who used to be his friend. If that shift from seeing the individual, Max, to seeing only a collective, \u201cthe Jewish race\u201d, resonates today, it might be because the political rhetoric of our time keeps making a similar move, one visible beyond the resurgence, on left and right, of antisemitism.

      "bodyText": "When Oasis\u2019s Liam Gallagher sang about how he wanted to \u201clive forever\u201d I don\u2019t think he meant putting in some extra shifts at work in his 70s. Many of us are, of course, living longer \u2013 if not forever \u2013 but ideally we should be able to enjoy this greater life expectancy, not see it as a threat or a physical burden. You might have thought that a policy paper called Ageing Confidently, produced this week by a thinktank called the Centre for Social Justice, might have a similar aim in mind. But this is not quite how it has turned out. While the CSJ made several sensible recommendations about flexible working and better healthcare, its truly startling suggestion was that there should be an increase in the state pension age to 70 by 2028, and to 75 by 2035. This would not be a case of live forever, but work forever. The proposal is based on some extraordinary assumptions, and betrays a narrow and ill-informed point of view. The paper imagines a wonderful world in which there is dynamic, supportive healthcare readily available to all over 50s, liberating them to pursue an active working life for another two decades.

      "body": "<p>Twenty years ago, Mark Jenkin returned to his boyhood home in north Cornwall to shoot his debut film, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/57755807\" title=\"\">Golden Burn</a>, about the tensions between local lads and the owner of a caravan park. Jenkin had been studying in Bournemouth, then living in London and would soon move back permanently. \u201cWhat\u2019s your Cornwall?\u201d his character asks. \u201cWeekend getaway, summer retreat, Cornish pasties and clotted cream, pixies? Or is it your home? Not your second home \u2013 your only home?\u201d</p> <p>While he was filming in Porthcothan, Jenkin thought up another film, this one about a Cornish civil war. It was August 1999 and thousands of visitors were driving out of the county on the A30, then a single lane, after witnessing the solar eclipse. Named in tribute to Peter Watkins\u2019s 1971 spoof documentary <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067633/\" title=\"\">Punishment Park</a>, The Holiday Park would be \u201clike an Ealing comedy where the locals rose up against mass tourism, ending with the military carpet-bombing the whole of Cornwall, wiping it out and starting again,\u201d Jenkin explains.</p> <p>He is finally releasing a film based on that idea, having spent two decades pondering the question of who gets to belong in a county defined as much by its poverty as by tourists and second-home owners. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/09/bait-review-mark-jenkin-hypnotic-take-on-tourists-ruining-cornwall-fishermen\" title=\"\">Bait</a> doesn\u2019t depict civil war but existential struggle: fisherman Martin (local actor and comedian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kernow_king?lang=en\" title=\"\">Edward Rowe</a>) is up the proverbial creek without a boat, trying to earn crumpled \u00a320 notes here and there by hand-netting fish and catching lobster while he saves up for a punt. He resents his brother for refashioning their late dad\u2019s boat as a tourist tripper, and resents the posh DFLs (down from London types) who bought his harbourside cottage and redecorated it with cliched nautical tat to maximise its appeal for Airbnb. \u201cAll bloody ropes and chains. Looks like a sex dungeon,\u201d Martin seethes, watching newcomers make a caricature out of his fading identity.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVlPl0SXFiE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eVlPl0SXFiE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is easy to take against haughty Tim and Sandra, with their entitlement and their fridge full of Waitrose food. But Martin is equally frustrating \u2013 stubborn to the point of martyrdom. It is quite likely that, as a fisherman, he voted for Brexit, while Tim and Sandra listen to intellectual radio broadcasts about the lies told by Vote Leave. Bait has compassion for all of them. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a victim to a certain extent,\u201d says Jenkin. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to get by and make a living \u2013 \u00a31 in Cornwall isn\u2019t worth the same as \u00a31 in London. In my eyes, the real baddie is the economic system we live in, where money is everything and you have these unrealistic aspirations.\u201d</p> <p>Bait explores the tension between tradition and progress, too. It is a blazing day in early July and Jenkin, tanned and affable in a tattered T-shirt, is drinking tea in the courtyard of <a href=\"https://www.newlynartschool.co.uk/art-courses/\" title=\"\">Newlyn School of Art</a>, having set a bucket of film to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing_(photography)\" title=\"\">wash</a> in the shade. Inside, his studio is packed with VHS tapes. Jenkin filmed Bait on a clockwork Bolex cine camera. The dense, twitchy grain of the monochrome 16mm film lends extra crackle to his story\u2019s tension, especially given Jenkin\u2019s love of confrontational closeups. The sound, added in the editing suite, gives the dialogue an uncanny distance and allows Jenkin to build up intimidating sonic effects \u2013 the oily chug of a boat engine, the slam of a vandalised lobster pot on the flagstones of a packed pub \u2013 the overall effect leading some critics to liken Bait to a horror film without the horror. </p> <p>Jenkin\u2019s rediscovery of physical film was part of the long journey to realising Bait. The director has been making shorts for 20 years. He directed an improvised film, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/53697799\" title=\"\">Happy Christmas</a>, in 2011. He loved making it, but hated the digital camera. \u201cThe computer was making decisions for me,\u201d he says. \u201cThere seemed to be a little interloper in the room.\u201d Then he had to undergo emergency surgery. During his three-week recuperation, he watched Mark Cousins\u2019s 15-hour <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044056/\" title=\"\">Story of Film</a> documentary three times. \u201cHearing him being so passionate about film made me realise I\u2019d lost the passion for it,\u201d Jenkin explains. \u201cI decided to retrace my steps to where I fell in love with making film \u2013 when I was 17, the first time I went to London with a roll of Super 8.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b3fdb59cc65dbaab85a98ece416632507738934\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b3fdb59cc65dbaab85a98ece416632507738934/0_0_2632_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac Woodvine and Edward Rowe as Neil and Martin in Bait.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isaac Woodvine and Edward Rowe as Neil and Martin in Bait.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Early Day Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It worked: he shot 2015\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/festivals/encounters-35mm-broncos-house-revival\" title=\"\">Bronco\u2019s House</a>, a 45-minute feature about the Cornish housing crisis, on the Bolex. It was well received, so he revived The Holiday Park idea. Jenkin explains his working methods: \u201cWe\u2019re not transitioning into a digital age any more \u2013 we\u2019re within it. I\u2019m not reacting against it, but that move is something that\u2019s prompted quite a lot of my work. It made me give up trying to keep up with it, and go backwards, technically speaking anyway, to something that will never change so I can master it.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledges the danger of fetishising authenticity, just as he is wary of overstating parallels to his great-great-great-great-grandfather, the artist <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/alfred-wallis-577\" title=\"\">Alfred Wallis</a>, whose primitive paintings of an already-lost shipping fleet won him approval from the St Ives school. Jenkin would rather talk about the benefits of limitations \u2013 a defining quality of Cornwall\u2019s film scene, where, before YouTube, film-makers relied on a robust village hall screening network \u2013 and Bait\u2019s themes.</p> <p>Being from Cornwall, I found his writing as striking as the film\u2019s aesthetic. Too often, the county is portrayed as a dopey backwater or a picturesque backdrop to Poldark\u2019s pecs; its people easy punchlines speaking in a generic \u201cMomerset\u201d accent. Jenkin\u2019s ear for local cadence is part of Bait\u2019s spellbinding rhythm. Take this exchange between Martin and a taxi driver: \u201cAll right?\u201d \u201cSpot on.\u201d \u201cIdeal.\u201d What probably sounds gnomic scans as a whole conversation to locals.</p> <p>\u201cGenerally, it\u2019s awful,\u201d Jenkin says of Cornwall on screen. \u201cI\u2019m careful not to sound too precious about it \u2013 and it\u2019s the same for a lot of places \u2013 but it\u2019s a laziness on the part of film-makers. If you want a stupid character, rather than writing a complex character that\u2019s a bit stupid, just give them a Cornish accent.\u201d He mentions the late Cornish playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/15/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Nick Darke</a>, an early mentor. \u201cIf you read his plays, the way he writes phonetically, you cannot read that and not sound Cornish because he understands Cornish sentence structure. The way Cornish people speak English derives from a totally separate language where word order is different, so you get things like: \u2018Going down the shops, are ya?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55a36088a6ebdcf13915c8c720750931628f3232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55a36088a6ebdcf13915c8c720750931628f3232/0_0_2632_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Woodvine and Simon Shepherd as Tim and Sandra in Bait.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Woodvine and Simon Shepherd as Tim and Sandra in Bait.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Early Day Films Limited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He admits he could be criticised for writing the uptight \u201cupcountry people\u201d simplistically. \u201cI could always say: \u2018Well, I\u2019m just redressing the balance a little bit.\u2019\u201d He laughs. The important thing, he says, is that local fishermen feel understood. Bait isn\u2019t set in Newlyn \u2013 its location is imagined, never named \u2013 but it is inspired by Jenkin\u2019s home. Fishing is \u201cthe heart of Newlyn\u201d, he says. \u201cWithout it, we would be another gentrified part of Cornwall.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5dc3590f5f86aac278e8af48880564440b4074ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dc3590f5f86aac278e8af48880564440b4074ab/949_824_1144_1429/801.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Newlyn fishermen deserve better\u2019: an anonymous protest in Newlyn.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Newlyn fishermen deserve better\u2019: an anonymous protest in Newlyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Snapes/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Down the hill in the village, someone has attached a handwritten sign to a lamp-post: \u201cNewlyn fishermen deserve better.\u201d The sentiment is vague, but palpably desperate.

They\u2019re always demonised, whether it\u2019s politically or environmentally.\u201d</p> <p>The EU referendum took place about a year before Bait started shooting, but the result didn\u2019t change Jenkin\u2019s story. \u201cYou could see it coming,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a disenfranchised people who were given the chance to reject something.

      "bodyText": "Twenty years ago, Mark Jenkin returned to his boyhood home in north Cornwall to shoot his debut film, Golden Burn, about the tensions between local lads and the owner of a caravan park. Jenkin had been studying in Bournemouth, then living in London and would soon move back permanently. \u201cWhat\u2019s your Cornwall?\u201d his character asks. \u201cWeekend getaway, summer retreat, Cornish pasties and clotted cream, pixies? Or is it your home? Not your second home \u2013 your only home?\u201d While he was filming in Porthcothan, Jenkin thought up another film, this one about a Cornish civil war. It was August 1999 and thousands of visitors were driving out of the county on the A30, then a single lane, after witnessing the solar eclipse. Named in tribute to Peter Watkins\u2019s 1971 spoof documentary Punishment Park, The Holiday Park would be \u201clike an Ealing comedy where the locals rose up against mass tourism, ending with the military carpet-bombing the whole of Cornwall, wiping it out and starting again,\u201d Jenkin explains. He is finally releasing a film based on that idea, having spent two decades pondering the question of who gets to belong in a county defined as much by its poverty as by tourists and second-home owners. Bait doesn\u2019t depict civil war but existential struggle: fisherman Martin (local actor and comedian Edward Rowe) is up the proverbial creek without a boat, trying to earn crumpled \u00a320 notes here and there by hand-netting fish and catching lobster while he saves up for a punt. He resents his brother for refashioning their late dad\u2019s boat as a tourist tripper, and resents the posh DFLs (down from London types) who bought his harbourside cottage and redecorated it with cliched nautical tat to maximise its appeal for Airbnb. \u201cAll bloody ropes and chains. Looks like a sex dungeon,\u201d Martin seethes, watching newcomers make a caricature out of his fading identity. It is easy to take against haughty Tim and Sandra, with their entitlement and their fridge full of Waitrose food. But Martin is equally frustrating \u2013 stubborn to the point of martyrdom. It is quite likely that, as a fisherman, he voted for Brexit, while Tim and Sandra listen to intellectual radio broadcasts about the lies told by Vote Leave. Bait has compassion for all of them. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a victim to a certain extent,\u201d says Jenkin. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to get by and make a living \u2013 \u00a31 in Cornwall isn\u2019t worth the same as \u00a31 in London. In my eyes, the real baddie is the economic system we live in, where money is everything and you have these unrealistic aspirations.\u201d Bait explores the tension between tradition and progress, too. It is a blazing day in early July and Jenkin, tanned and affable in a tattered T-shirt, is drinking tea in the courtyard of Newlyn School of Art, having set a bucket of film to wash in the shade. Inside, his studio is packed with VHS tapes. Jenkin filmed Bait on a clockwork Bolex cine camera. The dense, twitchy grain of the monochrome 16mm film lends extra crackle to his story\u2019s tension, especially given Jenkin\u2019s love of confrontational closeups. The sound, added in the editing suite, gives the dialogue an uncanny distance and allows Jenkin to build up intimidating sonic effects \u2013 the oily chug of a boat engine, the slam of a vandalised lobster pot on the flagstones of a packed pub \u2013 the overall effect leading some critics to liken Bait to a horror film without the horror. Jenkin\u2019s rediscovery of physical film was part of the long journey to realising Bait. The director has been making shorts for 20 years. He directed an improvised film, Happy Christmas, in 2011. He loved making it, but hated the digital camera. \u201cThe computer was making decisions for me,\u201d he says. \u201cThere seemed to be a little interloper in the room.\u201d Then he had to undergo emergency surgery. During his three-week recuperation, he watched Mark Cousins\u2019s 15-hour Story of Film documentary three times. \u201cHearing him being so passionate about film made me realise I\u2019d lost the passion for it,\u201d Jenkin explains. \u201cI decided to retrace my steps to where I fell in love with making film \u2013 when I was 17, the first time I went to London with a roll of Super 8.\u201d It worked: he shot 2015\u2019s Bronco\u2019s House, a 45-minute feature about the Cornish housing crisis, on the Bolex. It was well received, so he revived The Holiday Park idea. Jenkin explains his working methods: \u201cWe\u2019re not transitioning into a digital age any more \u2013 we\u2019re within it. I\u2019m not reacting against it, but that move is something that\u2019s prompted quite a lot of my work. It made me give up trying to keep up with it, and go backwards, technically speaking anyway, to something that will never change so I can master it.\u201d He acknowledges the danger of fetishising authenticity, just as he is wary of overstating parallels to his great-great-great-great-grandfather, the artist Alfred Wallis, whose primitive paintings of an already-lost shipping fleet won him approval from the St Ives school. Jenkin would rather talk about the benefits of limitations \u2013 a defining quality of Cornwall\u2019s film scene, where, before YouTube, film-makers relied on a robust village hall screening network \u2013 and Bait\u2019s themes. Being from Cornwall, I found his writing as striking as the film\u2019s aesthetic. Too often, the county is portrayed as a dopey backwater or a picturesque backdrop to Poldark\u2019s pecs; its people easy punchlines speaking in a generic \u201cMomerset\u201d accent. Jenkin\u2019s ear for local cadence is part of Bait\u2019s spellbinding rhythm. Take this exchange between Martin and a taxi driver: \u201cAll right?\u201d \u201cSpot on.\u201d \u201cIdeal.\u201d What probably sounds gnomic scans as a whole conversation to locals. \u201cGenerally, it\u2019s awful,\u201d Jenkin says of Cornwall on screen. \u201cI\u2019m careful not to sound too precious about it \u2013 and it\u2019s the same for a lot of places \u2013 but it\u2019s a laziness on the part of film-makers. If you want a stupid character, rather than writing a complex character that\u2019s a bit stupid, just give them a Cornish accent.\u201d He mentions the late Cornish playwright Nick Darke, an early mentor. \u201cIf you read his plays, the way he writes phonetically, you cannot read that and not sound Cornish because he understands Cornish sentence structure. The way Cornish people speak English derives from a totally separate language where word order is different, so you get things like: \u2018Going down the shops, are ya?\u2019\u201d He admits he could be criticised for writing the uptight \u201cupcountry people\u201d simplistically. \u201cI could always say: \u2018Well, I\u2019m just redressing the balance a little bit.\u2019\u201d He laughs. The important thing, he says, is that local fishermen feel understood. Bait isn\u2019t set in Newlyn \u2013 its location is imagined, never named \u2013 but it is inspired by Jenkin\u2019s home. Fishing is \u201cthe heart of Newlyn\u201d, he says. \u201cWithout it, we would be another gentrified part of Cornwall.\u201d Down the hill in the village, someone has attached a handwritten sign to a lamp-post: \u201cNewlyn fishermen deserve better.\u201d The sentiment is vague, but palpably desperate. In 2016, Newlyn was the largest fishing port in England for landings, but it is among the 25 of Britain\u2019s 41 ports classified as deprived. In May, a report outlined the mental illness crisis in Cornwall\u2019s fishing community, stemming from poor work-life balance, precarious employment and weather, dangerous working conditions and sleep deprivation. \u201cThey\u2019re the last hunters, and they\u2019re my heroes,\u201d says Jenkin. \u201cI\u2019d really love them to see it and for them to know that there is somebody who\u2019s putting the complexity of their lives on screen rather than being treated simplistically as a political bargaining chip. They\u2019re always demonised, whether it\u2019s politically or environmentally.\u201d The EU referendum took place about a year before Bait started shooting, but the result didn\u2019t change Jenkin\u2019s story. \u201cYou could see it coming,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a disenfranchised people who were given the chance to reject something. Fishermen are always getting screwed over.\u201d Still, he doesn\u2019t think Brexit is the answer. \u201cA complete rethink in how you treat working people and industry is actually what\u2019s needed. The fishermen will get screwed over again.\u201d He has not seen the cloying film Fisherman\u2019s Friends, Bait\u2019s polar opposite. \u201cSo I couldn\u2019t possibly comment.\u201d He laughs. Bait\u2019s local premiere takes place at Newlyn Filmhouse, an arthouse cinema in a former fish merchant that opened in April 2016. It is a brilliant local resource, but doesn\u2019t it exemplify the tensions in Jenkin\u2019s film? \u201cThere\u2019s a danger that Newlyn will get gentrified like a lot of other places,\u201d he admits. The old warehouse \u201ccould have easily been holiday flats. It is a funny one \u2013 I\u2019m opposed to gentrification, but if it\u2019s an arthouse cinema, we\u2019ll let it go.\u201d That is not as much of a cop-out as it sounds: \u201cThe thing is, with Newlyn, historically, there\u2019s always been a link between the arts world and the world of fishing,\u201d says Jenkin. \u201cThey\u2019re not that different, really.\u201d He brings up the prewar slum clearances, when Penzance town council intended to replace 350 \u201csqualid\u201d Newlyn houses with a new estate. Artists including Stanhope Forbes and Geoffrey Garnier joined local fishing families in challenging the plans. Together, they managed to save more than a third of the homes. It comes back to the idea that Jenkin has spent two decades refining: rural communities can\u2019t afford to be stagnant.

The <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\">RealClearPolitics average</a> has him ahead of Bernie Sanders by around 12 points, and he has the support of major party funders. But less than a third of Democratic voters are planning to vote for Biden, down from more than 40% the week after his 25 April announcement. An Economist/YouGov <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/u4gcv1suy6/econTabReport.pdf\">poll from this week</a> shows the race narrowing to within the margin of error \u2013 Biden at 22%, Sanders at 19%, and Elizabeth Warren at 18%.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s fundraising picture also looks less rosy than it did back in May. He\u2019s still the preferred choice of big party donors, but grassroots enthusiasm is receding. After raising an impressive $4.6m online on this first day of his campaign in April, things have slowed to a trickle. As <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/joe-biden-online-fundraising-actblue/\">Politico reports</a>, Biden\u2019s median online daily fundraising by the end of June was just $67,000 a day, considerably below Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The case for Biden\u2019s invincibility is baffling \u2013 he\u2019s been running for the Democratic nomination (and losing) since the 80s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sanders is an especially important benchmark for Biden. They seem to be competing over much the same base \u2013 working class, diverse, not college educated \u2013 and either would benefit from the other\u2019s downfall. Despite a narrative earlier this summer of campaign dysfunction and imminent collapse, recent polls have showed that the Vermont senator in a steady position within striking distance of Biden. Sanders has a rabid base of volunteers, superior online fundraising infrastructure, and his existing support may even be <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/458161-polls-suggest-sanders-may-be-underestimated\">undercounted</a> by most polls.</p> <p>Yet the media narrative continues to paint Sanders as a fringe pariah and Biden as the inevitable 2020 candidate. It\u2019s reminiscent of the 2016 Republican primaries, in which Donald Trump was considered an unserious candidate whose support was continually underestimated. The <em>serious</em> commentators kept waiting for an establishment wave of moderate Republicans to make first Jeb Bush, then Marco Rubio, and then even Ted Cruz happen.</p> <p>The case for Biden\u2019s invincibility is especially baffling \u2013 he\u2019s been running for the Democratic nomination (and losing) since the 1980s. It simply boils down to Obama coalition supporters (particularly black and brown voters) going with the most familiar face to rid of Trump era upheavals.</p> <p>But electability is just one element of what voters are looking for, and Biden is running on nothing else. He has failed to adequately address his past positions in favor of <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?445222-1/vice-president-biden-delivers-speech-middle-class-economy&amp;start=1609\">Medicare and Social Security cuts</a>, his engineering of loathed free trade deals, or his opposition to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/05/joe-biden-busing-problem-226791\">important desegregation measures</a>.</p> <p>While other candidates are galvanizing people around Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and calls to redistribute wealth and power from the 1% to working Americans, Biden is offering nothing. Poke one hole in his electability bubble and his campaign looks ready to implode.</p> <p>This early in the race things are constantly changing \u2013 many people are still undecided and won\u2019t start paying attention until much later on \u2013 so we would do ourselves a lot of good not to live and die with every poll. However, if there is one lesson from the 2016 general election worth remembering it\u2019s this: most people might have not liked Donald Trump, but he gave those who did a real reason to turn out on Election Day. He was a candidate with very obvious convictions running against someone who seemed to focus group and triangulate her every position.</p> <p>Joe Biden is Hillary Clinton 2.0. Perhaps Trump\u2019s time in office has been enough of a disaster that idea-avoidance will work this time. But if voters want to be inspired, they\u2019ll turn elsewhere or just stay at home again. Who knows, Jill Biden might even join them.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bhaskar Sunkara is the founding editor of <a href=\"http://jacobinmag.com/about/\">Jacobin magazine</a> and a Guardian US columnist.

An Economist/YouGov poll from this week shows the race narrowing to within the margin of error \u2013 Biden at 22%, Sanders at 19%, and Elizabeth Warren at 18%. Biden\u2019s fundraising picture also looks less rosy than it did back in May. He\u2019s still the preferred choice of big party donors, but grassroots enthusiasm is receding. After raising an impressive $4.6m online on this first day of his campaign in April, things have slowed to a trickle. As Politico reports, Biden\u2019s median online daily fundraising by the end of June was just $67,000 a day, considerably below Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders. Sanders is an especially important benchmark for Biden. They seem to be competing over much the same base \u2013 working class, diverse, not college educated \u2013 and either would benefit from the other\u2019s downfall. Despite a narrative earlier this summer of campaign dysfunction and imminent collapse, recent polls have showed that the Vermont senator in a steady position within striking distance of Biden. Sanders has a rabid base of volunteers, superior online fundraising infrastructure, and his existing support may even be undercounted by most polls. Yet the media narrative continues to paint Sanders as a fringe pariah and Biden as the inevitable 2020 candidate. It\u2019s reminiscent of the 2016 Republican primaries, in which Donald Trump was considered an unserious candidate whose support was continually underestimated. The serious commentators kept waiting for an establishment wave of moderate Republicans to make first Jeb Bush, then Marco Rubio, and then even Ted Cruz happen. The case for Biden\u2019s invincibility is especially baffling \u2013 he\u2019s been running for the Democratic nomination (and losing) since the 1980s. It simply boils down to Obama coalition supporters (particularly black and brown voters) going with the most familiar face to rid of Trump era upheavals. But electability is just one element of what voters are looking for, and Biden is running on nothing else. He has failed to adequately address his past positions in favor of Medicare and Social Security cuts, his engineering of loathed free trade deals, or his opposition to important desegregation measures. While other candidates are galvanizing people around Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and calls to redistribute wealth and power from the 1% to working Americans, Biden is offering nothing. Poke one hole in his electability bubble and his campaign looks ready to implode. This early in the race things are constantly changing \u2013 many people are still undecided and won\u2019t start paying attention until much later on \u2013 so we would do ourselves a lot of good not to live and die with every poll. However, if there is one lesson from the 2016 general election worth remembering it\u2019s this: most people might have not liked Donald Trump, but he gave those who did a real reason to turn out on Election Day. He was a candidate with very obvious convictions running against someone who seemed to focus group and triangulate her every position. Joe Biden is Hillary Clinton 2.0. Perhaps Trump\u2019s time in office has been enough of a disaster that idea-avoidance will work this time. But if voters want to be inspired, they\u2019ll turn elsewhere or just stay at home again. Who knows, Jill Biden might even join them. Bhaskar Sunkara is the founding editor of Jacobin magazine and a Guardian US columnist.

This comes amid warnings the government\u2019s attempts to repeal the medevac laws could have fatal consequences, and accusations by Medecins Sans Frontieres that Nauru has breached medical ethics. There are also concerns that more than 50 men were sent to Papua New Guinea\u2019s immigration detention centre without access to phones in a bid to block applications for medevac. The home affairs department confirmed an incident of self-harm had occurred on Nauru, and said the man was \u201creceiving appropriate medical support\u201d at the Republic of Nauru hospital. \u201cThe Australian and Nauru governments will continue to provide support,\u201d a spokesman said. There are almost 300 people still on Nauru under the offshore processing regime established by the Australian government there and on PNG\u2019s Manus Island. A Senate inquiry is examining a government bill to repeal the medevac laws, which give Australian doctors power to facilitate the urgent medical transfer of a refugee from Manus and Nauru. The government\u2019s previous \u2013 and still existing \u2013 policy often saw delays of up to five years. At Sydney\u2019s Westmead children\u2019s hospital on Friday, a refugee paediatric health conference heard the government\u2019s original system for medical transfers was \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d, and that the medevac system must stay in place. \u201cI\u2019m still speechless that people didn\u2019t die while we were there,\u201d a MSF psychiatrist, Beth O\u2019Connor, said. \u201cWe were so close so many times.

In a submission to the Senate inquiry, MSF reiterated its damning findings on the state of health and healthcare on Nauru, and called for Australia to act. It is scheduled to appear at the inquiry on Monday. Its executive director for Australia, Paul McPhun,said that when the group arrived on Nauru in November 2017 it found a mental health crisis which the government was not equipped to deal with. \u201cSeveral incidents during our time on the island concerned us, as did the government of Nauru\u2019s willingness to delay and block transfers against professional medical advice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to eject MSF with little warning in October 2018, and in doing so cut off patients from their doctors, clearly placed these patients unnecessarily at risk and compromised our medical professionals\u2019 ability to do their duty.\u201d MSF was abruptly kicked off Nauru in October after almost a year of providing psychiatric treatment. Nauru accused it of conspiring against the government, and said it had expelled MSF when it learned the doctors were treating refugees as well as Nauruans.

Shortly afterwards, the Nauruan government outlawed telemedicine, effectively cutting off MSF\u2019s attempts to keep treating patients and hindering the medevac process. McPhun said this was \u201ca clear attempt to impede patients from accessing professional medical care of their choice, again a threat to patients\u2019 interests and ultimately their wellbeing\u201d. Last week PNG immigration authorities sent more than 50 men to the immigration detention centre in the Bomana prison complex in Port Moresby. Their phones were taken and, according to the Kurdish Iranian journalist and refugee, Behrouz Boochani, they have not been given sufficient food and the UNHCR has not been able to visit. The UNHCR declined to comment. Boochani said more than 20 men had self harmed since their detention and some were hospitalised. He accused the Australian and PNG governments of detaining the men and removing their phones to halt any applications for medevac. He added that the PNG government has begun transferring all Manus-residing men to Port Moresby, despite earlier presenting it as voluntary. \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",

      "body": "<p>For most of the 20th century J Lyons &amp; Co Ltd lodged at the heart of Britain\u2019s social imagination. From the 1920s you could pop into a Lyons tea shop to be served by a \u201cnippy\u201d, a light-footed waitress got up like a parlourmaid. If you were a working girl of the newest and nicest variety \u2013 a secretary, teacher or shop assistant \u2013 you could eat an express lunch on your own in a Lyons without risking your respectability. If you were feeling particularly smart, you could go up to \u201ctown\u201d and stay in the art deco-ish Strand Palace or Regent\u2019s Palace hotels, vernacular versions of elite institutions such as Claridge\u2019s or The Savoy. In the evening you might venture out to the \u201cTroc\u201d, or Trocadero, in your best togs, where you could enjoy a fancy dinner and dance to a jazz band. Back home, the stream of comforts continued as you sat down with a cup of Lyons tea while your children might get a Mivvi, a sumptuous ice-cream-lolly hybrid.</p> <p>Customers liked knowing that the firm that provided them with so many reliable treats was run by a family, although exactly who that family was and where it came from remained hazy. The name subliminally suggested \u201clion\u201d and therefore something enduringly, heraldically British. Nothing could be further from the truth. Jo Lyons was connected to the Salmon &amp; Gluckstein dynasty whose founder had arrived in Whitechapel from Prussia via Belgium in 1843. \u201cLyons\u201d rolled off the tongue better than Gluckstein or even Salmon and it also kept the two sides of the business sounding separate, in case the risky move from cigars to mass catering crashed and burned. As well as muffling the firm\u2019s Jewish origins, \u201cLyons\u201d covertly signposted its imperial reach: agents for the company scoured the American south for the best-priced tobacco and the Indian subcontinent for the tenderest tea, and took inspiration from Europe\u2019s smartest pastry counters, before metabolising these far-flung raw materials into a brand that felt as British as a rainy afternoon in Piccadilly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Commentators would hint that the Lyons dynasty was run by sticky-fingered immigrants who put Mammon above British values.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Life at Lyons Corner House wasn\u2019t all knickerbocker glories and ladies\u2019 fingers though. In this satisfying slab of dynastic history, Thomas Harding draws attention to the way that the family business formed and conducted itself against successive spasms of racial hatred. The original crisis that had propelled 22-year-old Samuel Gluckstein from Antwerp into London\u2019s East End had all the hallmarks of a setup: he had been accused of swindling, that old smear of antisemites everywhere. Whitechapel proved only marginally more congenial. There may not have been pogroms, but wild fantasies about blood libel still lingered: members of the extended clan were still living there in 1888 when rumours circulated that Jack the Ripper was a demonic Jew intent on the ritual slaughter of Christian women.</p> <p>Things got even worse in the next century with Oswald Mosley and his louts, not to mention the terror of knowing that at least one member of the now-prominent Salmon &amp; Gluckstein family was on Hitler\u2019s infamous list of undesirables to be rounded up the moment German boots landed at Dover. Most insidious of all was the dog-whistle racism that appeared in the press every time some bit of the company was caught up in a little local difficulty \u2013 a strike, an accounting mishap, trouble with apprentices. Commentators always managed to hint that the Lyons dynasty was run by sticky-fingered immigrants who put Mammon above human, which is to say British, values.</p> <p>Naturally, the family redoubled its efforts to show that it was as patriotic as a nicely buttered scone. The Salmon &amp; Gluckstein commitment to Britishness reached its apogee during the second world war when it turned its attention from biscuits to bombs: a seventh of all the explosives dropped by the allies came from the Lyons munitions factory at Elstow in Bedfordshire. Individual family members, meanwhile, progressed to the highest levels of public service by shedding cockney accents, acquiring university degrees and becoming Conservative MPs and knights of the realm. Harding, who is himself a scion of the family, reminds us of all the notable figures who have sprung from the same stock: Sir Keith Joseph, Nigella Lawson, Fiona Shackleton and George Monbiot, in addition to high court judges, physicians and scientists. The only person who sticks out in this story is the painter Gluck, AKA Hannah Gluckstein. It wasn\u2019t her queer art that upset the family so much as the way that Hannah wore a three-piece suit and insisted on being addressed as Peter.</p> <p>What also added to Gluck\u2019s alienation was that she had no direct access to her share of the family fortune. According to the original trust set up in the 1870s, female family members would be taken care of through dowries, pensions and allowances, but could never insist on anything approaching a birthright. Despite episodic rumblings, this arrangement lumbered on until the late 1980s when the trust finally agreed to a visit from a young female psychologist from the Tavistock Clinic to help it sort out its complicated feelings about how love and money hung together.</p> <p>By this time, anyway, the millions were dwindling. For the last 20 years Lyons had been obliged to sell off bits of its business. Nestl\u00e9 got the Mivvis, Allied took the tea, Trust House Forte acquired the keys to the hotels. At points like this in Harding\u2019s narrative it\u2019s hard not to feel as if one is being asked to plough through a particularly doomy shareholders\u2019 report. But such longueurs are a small price to pay for this mostly brisk, accessible account of how one Anglo-Jewish dynasty provided 20th-century Britain with the materials it required to imagine itself fondly as a land of cosy comfort.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Legacy by Thomas Harding is published by Heinemann (\u00a325).

If you were feeling particularly smart, you could go up to \u201ctown\u201d and stay in the art deco-ish Strand Palace or Regent\u2019s Palace hotels, vernacular versions of elite institutions such as Claridge\u2019s or The Savoy. In the evening you might venture out to the \u201cTroc\u201d, or Trocadero, in your best togs, where you could enjoy a fancy dinner and dance to a jazz band. Back home, the stream of comforts continued as you sat down with a cup of Lyons tea while your children might get a Mivvi, a sumptuous ice-cream-lolly hybrid. Customers liked knowing that the firm that provided them with so many reliable treats was run by a family, although exactly who that family was and where it came from remained hazy. The name subliminally suggested \u201clion\u201d and therefore something enduringly, heraldically British. Nothing could be further from the truth. Jo Lyons was connected to the Salmon &amp; Gluckstein dynasty whose founder had arrived in Whitechapel from Prussia via Belgium in 1843. \u201cLyons\u201d rolled off the tongue better than Gluckstein or even Salmon and it also kept the two sides of the business sounding separate, in case the risky move from cigars to mass catering crashed and burned. As well as muffling the firm\u2019s Jewish origins, \u201cLyons\u201d covertly signposted its imperial reach: agents for the company scoured the American south for the best-priced tobacco and the Indian subcontinent for the tenderest tea, and took inspiration from Europe\u2019s smartest pastry counters, before metabolising these far-flung raw materials into a brand that felt as British as a rainy afternoon in Piccadilly. Life at Lyons Corner House wasn\u2019t all knickerbocker glories and ladies\u2019 fingers though. In this satisfying slab of dynastic history, Thomas Harding draws attention to the way that the family business formed and conducted itself against successive spasms of racial hatred. The original crisis that had propelled 22-year-old Samuel Gluckstein from Antwerp into London\u2019s East End had all the hallmarks of a setup: he had been accused of swindling, that old smear of antisemites everywhere. Whitechapel proved only marginally more congenial. There may not have been pogroms, but wild fantasies about blood libel still lingered: members of the extended clan were still living there in 1888 when rumours circulated that Jack the Ripper was a demonic Jew intent on the ritual slaughter of Christian women. Things got even worse in the next century with Oswald Mosley and his louts, not to mention the terror of knowing that at least one member of the now-prominent Salmon &amp; Gluckstein family was on Hitler\u2019s infamous list of undesirables to be rounded up the moment German boots landed at Dover. Most insidious of all was the dog-whistle racism that appeared in the press every time some bit of the company was caught up in a little local difficulty \u2013 a strike, an accounting mishap, trouble with apprentices. Commentators always managed to hint that the Lyons dynasty was run by sticky-fingered immigrants who put Mammon above human, which is to say British, values. Naturally, the family redoubled its efforts to show that it was as patriotic as a nicely buttered scone. The Salmon &amp; Gluckstein commitment to Britishness reached its apogee during the second world war when it turned its attention from biscuits to bombs: a seventh of all the explosives dropped by the allies came from the Lyons munitions factory at Elstow in Bedfordshire. Individual family members, meanwhile, progressed to the highest levels of public service by shedding cockney accents, acquiring university degrees and becoming Conservative MPs and knights of the realm. Harding, who is himself a scion of the family, reminds us of all the notable figures who have sprung from the same stock: Sir Keith Joseph, Nigella Lawson, Fiona Shackleton and George Monbiot, in addition to high court judges, physicians and scientists. The only person who sticks out in this story is the painter Gluck, AKA Hannah Gluckstein. It wasn\u2019t her queer art that upset the family so much as the way that Hannah wore a three-piece suit and insisted on being addressed as Peter. What also added to Gluck\u2019s alienation was that she had no direct access to her share of the family fortune. According to the original trust set up in the 1870s, female family members would be taken care of through dowries, pensions and allowances, but could never insist on anything approaching a birthright. Despite episodic rumblings, this arrangement lumbered on until the late 1980s when the trust finally agreed to a visit from a young female psychologist from the Tavistock Clinic to help it sort out its complicated feelings about how love and money hung together. By this time, anyway, the millions were dwindling. For the last 20 years Lyons had been obliged to sell off bits of its business. Nestl\u00e9 got the Mivvis, Allied took the tea, Trust House Forte acquired the keys to the hotels. At points like this in Harding\u2019s narrative it\u2019s hard not to feel as if one is being asked to plough through a particularly doomy shareholders\u2019 report. But such longueurs are a small price to pay for this mostly brisk, accessible account of how one Anglo-Jewish dynasty provided 20th-century Britain with the materials it required to imagine itself fondly as a land of cosy comfort. \u2022 Legacy by Thomas Harding is published by Heinemann (\u00a325).

The tech industry, from CEOs to staffers, have led a new wave of workplace activism in areas beyond immigration, but employees in more traditional industries are also starting to speak up. Walk outs In June, employees at online furnishing retailer Wayfair walked out of its Boston headquarters in protest against the sale of furniture to migrant child detention facilities at the southern border. The company donated $100,000 to the Red Cross after the backlash, though protesters argued it should have been donated to a group providing care to migrants at the border. There is no indication, however, that Wayfair has declined orders from US immigration agencies. Whether or not employee activism moves companies to shift their business practices, it shows no signs of slowing down. Millennials are most likely to raise concerns about their employers, with 82% of them saying they have a right to speak out against their employer, according to the May study by Weber Shandwick. In the survey, 76% of Gen X workers and 65% of Boomers said they felt they had that right. \u201cSociety is so polarized that I think it has heightened many employees\u2019 attitudes towards what\u2019s going on and made them question what is right and wrong \u2013 and how far they are willing to go in terms of what they are willing to say,\u201d said Gaines-Ross. This increase is led by the tech industry, but Gaines-Ross said the Wayfair protest in July showed employee activism is moving into mainstream industries. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely on the move and heading towards other sectors,\u201d she said. As employee activism moves to other industries, it is also revealing how the US detention system \u2013 which detains more migrants than any other country \u2013 is entrenched with US businesses. After Donald Trump took the unusual step in July of announcing planned immigration raids which would use hotels to house people arrested in the round-up, major hotel chains released statements saying they didn\u2019t want to detain migrants, according to the AP. Hotels faced pressure from the main hotel workers union, Unite Here, as well as customers. Major banks have said they would no longer lend money to private companies which run immigrant detention centers and American Airlines and United Airlines said last year that they didn\u2019t want to fly children separated from their parents. The global public relations firm, Ogilvy, said it would continue to work with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) after facing criticism from employees over a multi-million dollar contract with the agency. \u201cSome of you feel strongly that we should stop working for CBP,\u201d Ogilvy chief executive John Seifert said to employees in a July memo, obtained by the Wall Street Journal. \u201cWhile I do understand and appreciate this point of view, I have concluded that our work for CBP is genuinely intended to improve the quality of this government agency\u2019s public services.\u201d Pressure from workers on political issues comes as the bosses of major US companies have signaled a shift in their guiding principles.

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government could target thousands of pensioners and other \u201csensitive\u201d welfare recipients under a proposed expansion of the controversial robodebt scheme needed to achieve a promised $2.1bn in budget savings, according to confidential documents seen by Guardian Australia. The documents, stamped \u201cPROTECTED CABINET\u201d, show the scheme would fall $600m short of its required budget savings unless it is expanded to hit \u201csensitive\u201d groups originally quarantined from data matching. This would include people considered \u201csensitive\u201d by the department: those aged 65 and over, those living in remote areas, and others considered vulnerable by Centrelink, including people who are homeless and those who have disabilities. \u201cEstimated savings over the forward estimates cannot be achieved without undertaking sensitive cohort reviews,\u201d says the early draft ministerial submission for the government services minister, Stuart Robert. According to the documents, the department would need to carry out an additional 1.6m income reviews over the next three years to reach the promised savings, including 350,000 debt-recovery reviews among \u201csensitive\u201d or vulnerable groups. If Robert and the social services minister, Anne Ruston, support the plan, Scott Morrison\u2019s cabinet will next month consider whether to begin what the department calls a \u201cstaged approach\u201d to the expansion, according to the documents. Guardian Australia approached Robert about the plan. Asked if the government planned to include vulnerable people \u2013 including those aged 65-74, those living in remote areas, and people with a vulnerability indicator \u2013 in the income compliance program, a spokesman would only say: \u201cThe government is not considering any proposal to commence online compliance for vulnerable Australians.\u201d The spokesman would not elaborate on whether over-65s were still being considered. The proposal seen by the Guardian says the government would: Conduct a pilot of 40,000 income reviews for people aged 65 to 74 this financial year, checking for welfare overpayments from business income and bank interest as well as pay-as-you-go income Develop new methodologies to identify \u201clow risk\u201d sensitive customers And then undertake further \u201cmodest pilots\u201d among 10,000 people who live in remote areas or have a \u201cvulnerability indicator\u201d on their Centrelink file in early 2020, before a broader rollout is considered The proposal would not require legislation and has sparked fresh controversy about the future of the program, which Labor, the Greens and welfare groups say should be abolished. Two Senate inquiries are set to examine the scheme. Responding to Guardian Australia\u2019s story, Labor\u2019s government services spokesman, Bill Shorten, said Robert should \u201cimmediately rule out applying a turbo-charged robodebt to vulnerable groups\u201d. \u201cMr Robert must now categorically with no weasel words tell the Australian people all these groups will continue to be protected from the cruel menace of robodebt,\u201d he said. The robodebt scheme has been marred by revelations that thousands of debts have been wiped or reduced since its launch in 2016. Critics argue the program places the onus on past and current welfare recipients to prove they do not owe debts dating back as far as seven years. They also question the methods used to calculate the overpayments, noting that about one in five debts issued have later been wiped, waived or reduced. The government excluded the \u201csensitive cohort\u201d of welfare recipients in 2017 at the height of what became known as the robodebt scandal. If the scheme is expanded, 240,000 older Australians, 40,000 people in remote areas (50% of whom are Indigenous) and 70,000 others considered vulnerable by Centrelink would be subject to the debt recovery program, the documents show. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Thousands would be likely to incur a debt given that of the 900,000 income reviews carried out so far, 80% have resulted in a debt letter. The department estimates about $430m would be raised from those aged 65 and over. The Department of Human Services has discussed the proposal with the Department of Social Services and the Department of Finance and note there is \u201cbroad support for the proposed strategy\u201d, according to the submission. The scheme is also the subject of a legal challenge. Noting this, the documents reveal that the commonwealth is reviewing the debt at the centre of the second case brought by Victoria Legal Aid. The department wiped the debt contested in the first case, then argued that it should not proceed. \u201cThe debt in Amato is under further review and may also be recalculated,\u201d the draft submission says. \u201cAt that time the department will review its position in that case.\u201d The department acknowledges public concerns \u201craised under the \u2018robodebt\u2019 banner\u201d may \u201cintensify should sensitive cohorts be included\u201d. It also tells the minister it looked at \u201calternative options\u201d but these were opposed because they would \u201chave a significant negative impact on the budget savings\u201d and require \u201csignificant cost offsets given the budget rules\u201d. One option was to continue to exclude older Australians from future income compliance reviews, which would cost about $430m over three years, while another would introduce a \u201cmore \u2018nuanced\u2019 approach to compliance officer decision making\u201d. That would \u201cimprove customer experience and engagement, and potentially reduce unnecessary touch/pain points with customers\u201d but was not favoured because it would increase the cost of each income review. The ministerial submission provided for Robert says he and Ruston are \u201crequired to bring forward\u201d the submission to cabinet in the 2019-20 mid year economic and fiscal outlook \u201cas per the authority letter from the prime minister\u201d. Ruston\u2019s office referred questions to Robert. Robert\u2019s spokesman said: \u201c\u2018Income compliance for our targeted welfare system is not new, It has been in place since the 1980s. In fact, online income compliance was ramped up with data matching under the former Labor Government in 2011.\u201d The spokesman declined to answer further questions posed by the Guardian.",

Alongside the pact at the exhibition at Russia\u2019s State Archives in Moscow are documents spanning from the 1938 Munich agreement and occupation of Czechoslovakia until the outbreak of war, which organisers say confirm Soviet fears that the west sought to redirect German aggression toward Moscow. The message to Europe is clear: everyone was at it. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who spoke at the exhibition\u2019s opening this week, made that point explicitly: \u201cUnder these circumstances, the Soviet Union was forced on its own to ensure its national security and signed a non-aggression pact with Germany,\u201d he said. The Soviet Union long denied that the secret protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact \u2013 which was signed on 23 August 1939 \u2013 ever existed, only acknowledging and denouncing it in 1989 under Mikhail Gorbachev. Now, Russia has sought to normalise the non-aggression pact, arguing that the treaty had been taken \u201cout of context\u201d of the vicious realpolitik of 1930s Europe.

The governments of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania have released a statement saying the pact \u201cdoomed half of Europe to decades of misery\u201d. In a statement, they added: \u201cThis is why on this day proclaimed by the European parliament as a European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Totalitarian Regimes we remember all those whose deaths and broken lives were a consequence of the crimes perpetrated under the ideology of Nazism and Stalinism.\u201d This kind of language is anathema to Moscow, where equivalencies of the Nazi and Soviet roles in the second world war have been deemed \u201cfalsifications of history\u201d and even a threat to the country\u2019s national security.

Over the last decade, the Kremlin has sought to combat criticism of its wartime record, by revising textbooks, expanding celebrations for Victory Day, and partnering with historians, reviving the tsarist-era Russian Military Historical Society in 2012 under the leadership of Sergei Naryshkin, a senior official later appointed as Russia\u2019s spy chief. \u201cFor better or for worse, history plays a colossal role in Russia, and is often used for political ends,\u201d said Oleg Budnitsky, the head of the International Centre for the History and Sociology of World War II and Its Consequences at the Higher School of Economics. \u201cWar history plays an exceptionally large role.\u201d The re-evaluation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact began as early as 2005, when Putin compared it to the Munich agreement and accused the Baltic states of attacking Russia \u201cto cover the shame of collaborationism\u201d. By 2007, as Russia clashed with Estonia over a bronze statue to a second world war soldier, Russian historians were increasingly publishing books and essays defending the pact as expedient. But praise for the treaty really escalated after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimeain 2014, when Moscow compared far-right support for Ukraine\u2019s revolution to Nazi-era collaboration. The following year, Vladimir Medinsky, the country\u2019s culture minister, called the treaty \u201ca great achievement of Soviet diplomacy\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the last few years is certainly a kind of backslide, clearly in connection with politics,\u201d said Budnitsky.",

More than 700,000 Dominicans live in New York, creating a natural pipeline between the two places. It runs even more smoothly for those seeking plastic surgery on the Caribbean island, where procedures are far cheaper: the average cost of liposuction in the US is $5,500, compared to $3,500 in the Dominican Republic.</p> <p>In 2018, more than 23,000 plastic surgeries were performed in the Dominican Republic and more than 18,000 of those were on foreigners. However, like Cede\u00f1o, not all who go there to get work done return home.</p> <p>In June, Manuel N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a New Yorker who had also gone to get liposculpture, died under the knife in a Dominican operating room. According to <a href=\"https://www.telemundo47.com/noticias/destacados/Joven-habria-muerto-tras-ser-operado-por-ginecologo-en-RD--511197732.html\">Telemundo</a>, the doctor who operated on him was actually a gynecologist. He had a past history of negligence and was charged for the deaths of two women in 2015 but the charges were dropped for lack of evidence.</p> <p>Then in July, Alexandra Medina, a 33-year-old from Yonkers, became the second New Yorker and third American to die within a month in a Dominican plastic surgery clinic when she went for a tummy tuck.</p> <p>Of the 12 New Yorkers who have died in Dominican plastic surgeries in the last six years, all but one underwent multiple surgeries at once. All 12 were black or Hispanic.</p> <p>Dr Myla Bennett, an Atlanta-based plastic surgeon who describes herself as a safe surgery advocate, started to speak out against botched plastic surgeries abroad on her social media pages a few years ago after realizing most patients being hurt and killed were women of color or people of lower socioeconomic status.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Dominican Republic doesn't adhere to the same US regulations on surgeries, which increases the likelihood of heart failure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bennett said the Dominican Republic doesn\u2019t adhere to the same US regulations concerning how much body fat can be removed in one surgery, which increases the likelihood of heart failure and other consequences during procedures.</p> <p>Despite the risks that come with surgery, she says people continue to flock to the Dominican Republic, because that\u2019s where they can get an extreme Coke bottle figure for a lower cost.</p> <p>\u201cThe ladies want this particular shape \u2013 a really exaggerated form with a small waist and big ole\u2019 hips and butt,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cA lot of the surgeons in the Dominican Republic, that\u2019s what they do really well.\u201d</p> <p>Hector Cabral, who practices at the International Center of Advanced Plastic Surgery (CIPLA) in downtown Santo Domingo, is known for sculpting impossibly voluptuous bodies. Like Contreras, Cede\u00f1o\u2019s doctor, he has a large following on social media, a tool which is heavily utilized to advertise their work and recruit new patients.</p> <p>Contreras and Cabral are also known for the nine combined times they have made headlines after patients died on their operating tables.</p> <p>Contreras\u2019 clinic was shut down two days after Cede\u00f1o\u2019s death by the national prosecutor\u2019s office, only to reopen four months later. In a radio interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h029bxz-gA4\">Radio Zol FM in June </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h029bxz-gA4\"> 2015</a>, Contreras admitted that there were three more accusations made against him from the families of three other patients who had died after surgery with him since 1999. He said that Dominican authorities declared no medical malpractices in those deaths. Contreras added that until Cede\u00f1o\u2019s death, he had performed more than 20,000 surgeries.</p> <p>Thirty minutes away from the posh hills of Arroyo Hondo towards the city center, CIPLA was shut down not as a result of a death during surgery, but due to a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6712a5.htm?s_cid=mm6712a5_w\">bacterial outbreak</a> in July 2017 in its operating rooms that infected 32 Americans, three of them New York City residents.</p> <p>A study last year by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons noted that between 2003 and 2017 there were 29 cases of postoperative infections in the Dominican Republic, compared to just three in Mexico \u2013 the second country with the most cases of plastic surgery tourists.</p> <p>In May, health authorities closed CIPLA again after a Dominican native, Altagracia Diaz, died during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrgpIqXhyd8\">a breast reduction</a> surgery with Cabral, becoming the fifth woman \u2013 three of whom are from New York \u2013 to die in Cabral\u2019s care since 2013. It has not reopened. There is one other known case this year of a death of a Dominican native \u2013 Julia Arias, who died after receiving a procedure in January in Santo Domingo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"story break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">story break</a> </figure>  <p><strong>On his Instagram account, which has more than 270,000 followers</strong>, Cabral publishes client testimonials and highly stylized before and after photos. Like Contreras and other doctors, he refers to his past clients as his \u201cdolls\u201d or, in this case, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/cabralbarbie/?hl=en\">Cabral barbies</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Thousands of pictures of women show them with the camera focused on their new breasts under tightly stretched tops or flaunting their new hips as they bulge out from under bikini straps. The comments section of each post turns into a tug-of-war for likes between those who say his surgeries are dangerous and those who swear by his work.</p> <p>But Cabral\u2019s recruitment has not always been limited to just social media. In 2011, Cabral pleaded guilty to charges from <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-secures-guilty-plea-unlicensed-plastic-surgeon-co-conspirator\">the New York </a><a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-secures-guilty-plea-unlicensed-plastic-surgeon-co-conspirator\">attorney </a><a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-secures-guilty-plea-unlicensed-plastic-surgeon-co-conspirator\">general\u2019s office</a> that he treated patients in upper Manhattan without a state medical license on at least 10 different occasions. According to the attorney general, Cabral offered medical consultations to women in beauty salons in Washington Heights as a recruiting tactic. As part of his punishment, Cabral had to pay more than $23,000 in restitution to ten clients, a $5,000 fine and he was barred from obtaining a New York medical license for three years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cabral had been suspended from the local regulatory board since 2015, but was still able to practice, which illustrates the lax rules in the country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a crowded press conference in May following D\u00edaz\u2019s death, Cabral appeared unapologetic and stated, monotonously, that she had \u201can unexpected event\u201d at the beginning of the operation and doctors unsuccessfully tried to revive her in intensive care. In the press conference, an unprompted Cabral said he never tried to flee the country.</p> <p>The Dominican Society of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, the local regulatory board that oversees the industry, <a href=\"https://www.cdn.com.do/2019/05/10/doctor-hector-cabral-esta-suspendido-la-sociedad-dominicana-cirugia-plastica-desde-2015/\">told a local news station</a> that Cabral had been suspended from the association since 2015. Cabral was still able to practice since he was registered with the country\u2019s health ministry, which illustrates the lax rules in the Dominican Republic. (The Guardian called and sent messages to Cabral on several occasions. He did not answer or respond.)</p> <p>Cabral\u2019s suspension came one year after New Yorker Rachene Hutchinson went into surgery with him and never came out.</p> <p>In July of 2014, Hutchinson, a mother of five from Long Island who frequented the island with her Dominican partner, traveled to Cabral\u2019s clinic for a \u201cmommy makeover\u201d: a combination of surgeries that usually involves reshaping the breasts and abdomen following pregnancy. She died from a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/supportrachenehutchinson/photos/a.1452500188358196/1493015480973333/?type=3\">build-up of fluid</a> that compresses the heart. Her mother, Diane Shields, posted her death certificate to a Facebook account which divulges details about her daughter\u2019s death and warns others about Cabral. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"story break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">story break</a> </figure>  <p><strong>At the end of June, Dominican health officials passed</strong> new plastic surgery regulations for the country\u2019s 56 clinics. Most notable is a new resolution that requires cardiovascular and preanesthetic assessments to be done before surgery. In addition, it recommends foreign patients wait 48 hours after their flight before going into surgery due to the air pressure, and at least another three weeks after the surgery to return on intercontinental flights. A 2015 resolution laid the ground rules for surgeon qualification requirements, but this is the first time that such specific preventative measures have been passed.</p> <p>The new health code includes increased sanctions against any doctor or clinic found to be guilty of medical malpractice. Clinics that are closed down, like CIPLA, will need to pass a health ministry-approved improvement plan to reopen.</p> <p>If potential patients were starting to grow weary of the number of deaths over the last six years, these new regulations may encourage them to think conditions are safer. Or maybe there was never a slow down in the pipeline anyway, even for those directly affected by the industry\u2019s flaws.</p> <p>\u201cThe pain is always there, it will always be there,\u201d Kendra said. \u201cI feel like you just learn how to live with that pain.\u201d</p> <p>But Kendra underwent surgery in the Dominican Republic herself this May, even though she had once promised herself she would let go of her long-held desire to get plastic surgery after her sister\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s just something like insecurities,\u201d Kendra said. \u201cI just want to make myself feel prettier.\u201d</p>",

Despite the risks that come with surgery, she says people continue to flock to the Dominican Republic, because that\u2019s where they can get an extreme Coke bottle figure for a lower cost. \u201cThe ladies want this particular shape \u2013 a really exaggerated form with a small waist and big ole\u2019 hips and butt,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cA lot of the surgeons in the Dominican Republic, that\u2019s what they do really well.\u201d Hector Cabral, who practices at the International Center of Advanced Plastic Surgery (CIPLA) in downtown Santo Domingo, is known for sculpting impossibly voluptuous bodies. Like Contreras, Cede\u00f1o\u2019s doctor, he has a large following on social media, a tool which is heavily utilized to advertise their work and recruit new patients. Contreras and Cabral are also known for the nine combined times they have made headlines after patients died on their operating tables. Contreras\u2019 clinic was shut down two days after Cede\u00f1o\u2019s death by the national prosecutor\u2019s office, only to reopen four months later. In a radio interview with Radio Zol FM in June 2015, Contreras admitted that there were three more accusations made against him from the families of three other patients who had died after surgery with him since 1999. He said that Dominican authorities declared no medical malpractices in those deaths. Contreras added that until Cede\u00f1o\u2019s death, he had performed more than 20,000 surgeries. Thirty minutes away from the posh hills of Arroyo Hondo towards the city center, CIPLA was shut down not as a result of a death during surgery, but due to a bacterial outbreak in July 2017 in its operating rooms that infected 32 Americans, three of them New York City residents. A study last year by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons noted that between 2003 and 2017 there were 29 cases of postoperative infections in the Dominican Republic, compared to just three in Mexico \u2013 the second country with the most cases of plastic surgery tourists. In May, health authorities closed CIPLA again after a Dominican native, Altagracia Diaz, died during a breast reduction surgery with Cabral, becoming the fifth woman \u2013 three of whom are from New York \u2013 to die in Cabral\u2019s care since 2013. It has not reopened. There is one other known case this year of a death of a Dominican native \u2013 Julia Arias, who died after receiving a procedure in January in Santo Domingo. On his Instagram account, which has more than 270,000 followers, Cabral publishes client testimonials and highly stylized before and after photos. Like Contreras and other doctors, he refers to his past clients as his \u201cdolls\u201d or, in this case, \u201cCabral barbies\u201d. Thousands of pictures of women show them with the camera focused on their new breasts under tightly stretched tops or flaunting their new hips as they bulge out from under bikini straps. The comments section of each post turns into a tug-of-war for likes between those who say his surgeries are dangerous and those who swear by his work. But Cabral\u2019s recruitment has not always been limited to just social media. In 2011, Cabral pleaded guilty to charges from the New York attorney general\u2019s office that he treated patients in upper Manhattan without a state medical license on at least 10 different occasions. According to the attorney general, Cabral offered medical consultations to women in beauty salons in Washington Heights as a recruiting tactic. As part of his punishment, Cabral had to pay more than $23,000 in restitution to ten clients, a $5,000 fine and he was barred from obtaining a New York medical license for three years. In a crowded press conference in May following D\u00edaz\u2019s death, Cabral appeared unapologetic and stated, monotonously, that she had \u201can unexpected event\u201d at the beginning of the operation and doctors unsuccessfully tried to revive her in intensive care. In the press conference, an unprompted Cabral said he never tried to flee the country. The Dominican Society of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, the local regulatory board that oversees the industry, told a local news station that Cabral had been suspended from the association since 2015. Cabral was still able to practice since he was registered with the country\u2019s health ministry, which illustrates the lax rules in the Dominican Republic. (The Guardian called and sent messages to Cabral on several occasions. He did not answer or respond.) Cabral\u2019s suspension came one year after New Yorker Rachene Hutchinson went into surgery with him and never came out. In July of 2014, Hutchinson, a mother of five from Long Island who frequented the island with her Dominican partner, traveled to Cabral\u2019s clinic for a \u201cmommy makeover\u201d: a combination of surgeries that usually involves reshaping the breasts and abdomen following pregnancy. She died from a build-up of fluid that compresses the heart. Her mother, Diane Shields, posted her death certificate to a Facebook account which divulges details about her daughter\u2019s death and warns others about Cabral. At the end of June, Dominican health officials passed new plastic surgery regulations for the country\u2019s 56 clinics. Most notable is a new resolution that requires cardiovascular and preanesthetic assessments to be done before surgery. In addition, it recommends foreign patients wait 48 hours after their flight before going into surgery due to the air pressure, and at least another three weeks after the surgery to return on intercontinental flights. A 2015 resolution laid the ground rules for surgeon qualification requirements, but this is the first time that such specific preventative measures have been passed. The new health code includes increased sanctions against any doctor or clinic found to be guilty of medical malpractice. Clinics that are closed down, like CIPLA, will need to pass a health ministry-approved improvement plan to reopen. If potential patients were starting to grow weary of the number of deaths over the last six years, these new regulations may encourage them to think conditions are safer. Or maybe there was never a slow down in the pipeline anyway, even for those directly affected by the industry\u2019s flaws. \u201cThe pain is always there, it will always be there,\u201d Kendra said. \u201cI feel like you just learn how to live with that pain.\u201d But Kendra underwent surgery in the Dominican Republic herself this May, even though she had once promised herself she would let go of her long-held desire to get plastic surgery after her sister\u2019s death. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just something like insecurities,\u201d Kendra said. \u201cI just want to make myself feel prettier.\u201d",

As the war barrels onward in northern Syria, refugees in neighbouring Turkey fear even walking the streets. Istanbul police have launched a crackdown on ID papers that has seen thousands swept up and deported back to the warzone. With public opinion turning against the 3.6 million Syrian guests, Turkey has reversed its long-standing \u201copen door policy\u201d to capitalise on bipartisan calls to send Syrians home. Facing accusations of refoulement, the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, has ignored the most vulnerable cases. Ward, who is a transgender woman, was legally residing in Istanbul and had been assigned a UNHCR protection officer who specialises in cases of LGBT refugees. While detained in a cell full of men, she feared a worse fate could befall her in Syria. Ward contacted friends who contacted UNHCR, and a legal aid counsellor was dispatched. But they were too late \u2013 she was deported the next day. Less than 100 metres after crossing the border, Ward was taken by HTS security officers. \u201cThey humiliated her after finding videos of her with men on her phone, and asked her why she shaved her arms and legs,\u201d says Kenan Shami, who was with Ward for the 20-hour bus ride to the border. Shami told the Guardian that militants handcuffed Ward, tied a bag over her head, and forced her into the trunk of a taxi. She has not been heard of since. Forced returns to a warzone violates both international law and Turkish law, which allows a 15-day window to appeal a deportation to the Constitutional Court. But lawyers say after the recent crackdown, authorities are exploiting a legal loophole by coercing refugees to sign papers saying they want to return voluntarily, and carrying out deportations so quickly advocates say they can\u2019t keep pace. \u201cWe see none of the legal waiting periods being respected.

Lawyers reject those claims. \u201cThey say they are taking them to another province, but our clients call us from Syria,\u201d said \u00d6zt\u00fcrkcan. Turkish officials say around 340,000 refugees have voluntarily returned to Syria. UNHCR, which is mandated to oversee the process, has only monitored around 62,000. Refugee advocates warn that officers in deportation centres have kept refugees detained until they relent and sign the papers put in front of them. The Istanbul Bar Association has brought 180 complaints against police officers for improper use of refugees\u2019 voluntary return forms. UNHCR officials in Ankara, Geneva, and New York refused the Guardian\u2019s requests to comment on any cases of deportations from Turkey to Syria. Police raids and identity checks launched on 12 July have mostly targeted groups of Syrian men in dense Istanbul neighbourhoods. Ward brought up her fears of being stopped on the street and deported to Syria frequently, said her former roommate, Sami. The two lived in an LGBT shelter in Istanbul, and went together to their UNHCR asylum appointments. \u201cThe NGOs are asleep, they are useless,\u201d Sami said. \u201cWard and I spoke to many organisations about deportations and they didn\u2019t believe us, they seem unable to believe that the Turkish government is really doing this.\u201d Ward was \u201ca beloved person, who would never hurt anyone,\u201d Sami said. \u201cHer dream was just to be safe, because her siblings and family were threatening her saying they want to kill [her] because [she\u2019s] queer.\u201d To cope with fears of visibly going through her gender transition process, Ward chose to maintain a more masculine look. \u201cOn the outside people saw a man, but on the inside there was a complete woman in every sense of the word, and Ward preferred to be called \u2018she\u2019,\u201d Sami said.

Shirtless in front of a wall in his Kingsport, Tennessee, home, Tester flicks his hair with barely contained excitement. After months of live-streaming his middle American high school life on <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2015/12/younow-a-live-streaming-social-network-is-making-stars.html\">YouNow</a>, cultivating a following of teenage girls who tuned into him lip-syncing, dancing or just hanging out, Tester received interest from a talent manager. Clutching himself and spinning around, he tumbled through a series of revelations. \u201cThis is before I\u2019m famous!\u201d He leaned into the selfie lens. \u201cIt is 10.06pm. I\u2019m not famous right now. Hopefully I\u2019ll be famous soon.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/16/obamas-first-film-netflix-american-factory-biggest-documentary-2019\">The Obamas' first film: will American Factory be the biggest documentary of 2019?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An iPhone, propped up by a tip jar of Tester\u2019s fan mail, plays this video midway through Jawline, a new documentary that takes an empathetic look at the vertigo of social media stardom, the always-on demands of late-2010s fame, and the newest generation of teenage fan. In the film, which won a special jury award at this year\u2019s Sundance film festival, Tester offers a case study of this specific brand of fame, baffling to those not steeped in Vine, YouTube, YouNow and TikTok. Sixteen years old, with a southern drawl that can\u2019t decide whether to stretch \u201cfudge\u201d or \u201cfuck\u201d (result: \u201cfuuudgeya\u201d), Tester wants to be famous, if only to escape his small town. So he turns to livestreaming, in which he broadcasts daily updates of his life and chats with teenage girls eager to have a boy tell them, earnestly, to chase their dreams.</p> <p>By the time the director Liza Mandelup\u2019s cameras arrive in Tester\u2019s home \u2013 dishes stacked in the sink, old driveway toys still piled outside \u2013 Tester has already amassed a following of a couple thousand.

      "bodyText": "Sometime between 2016 and 2017 \u2013 a distinct period, if you follow the rapid hot and colds of social media platforms \u2013 16-year-old Austyn Tester filmed a video just for himself. Shirtless in front of a wall in his Kingsport, Tennessee, home, Tester flicks his hair with barely contained excitement. After months of live-streaming his middle American high school life on YouNow, cultivating a following of teenage girls who tuned into him lip-syncing, dancing or just hanging out, Tester received interest from a talent manager. Clutching himself and spinning around, he tumbled through a series of revelations. \u201cThis is before I\u2019m famous!\u201d He leaned into the selfie lens. \u201cIt is 10.06pm. I\u2019m not famous right now. Hopefully I\u2019ll be famous soon.\u201d An iPhone, propped up by a tip jar of Tester\u2019s fan mail, plays this video midway through Jawline, a new documentary that takes an empathetic look at the vertigo of social media stardom, the always-on demands of late-2010s fame, and the newest generation of teenage fan. In the film, which won a special jury award at this year\u2019s Sundance film festival, Tester offers a case study of this specific brand of fame, baffling to those not steeped in Vine, YouTube, YouNow and TikTok. Sixteen years old, with a southern drawl that can\u2019t decide whether to stretch \u201cfudge\u201d or \u201cfuck\u201d (result: \u201cfuuudgeya\u201d), Tester wants to be famous, if only to escape his small town. So he turns to livestreaming, in which he broadcasts daily updates of his life and chats with teenage girls eager to have a boy tell them, earnestly, to chase their dreams. By the time the director Liza Mandelup\u2019s cameras arrive in Tester\u2019s home \u2013 dishes stacked in the sink, old driveway toys still piled outside \u2013 Tester has already amassed a following of a couple thousand. His home life reveals social media\u2019s dizzying juxtapositions: at fast food joints or jumping into a river he is a normal teenage boy, friendly and unremarkable. But in a chat room, his mere presence melts girls to tears. Linking the two identities is his camera \u2013 the online conduit to a shapeless fandom, as amorphous and precarious as a string-wand bubble. While Tester filmed his potential last moment of pre-fame, Mandelup was deep in the scene of star meet-and-greets, where social media celebrities host fans for surreal performances of selfies, hype-manning and occasional music. In 2015, Mandelup had been reflecting on her own teenage pendulum of emotions when she discovered Magcon (an acronym for Meet-and-Greet Conference), the OG tour of Vine stars. It was \u201cthe strangest world I have ever seen\u201d, Mandelup told the Guardian. \u201cI just became obsessed.\u201d In particular, she fixated on how teenage fandom \u201cmust be so different today, to go through all the emotions of being a teenager when you have so much screen interaction, and so much of your life is lived online\u201d. Moreover, she said, the intensity of teenage fandom \u2013 long dismissed, and made more intense by the omni-accessibility of social media content \u2013 was rarely discussed, let alone treated seriously.

The company had already scaled back workers at the Lordstown plant, and this closure saw 1,500 workers, the last of the once huge workforce, out of their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Mark Sweetwood, the managing editor of the Vindicator newspaper, which serves the Mahoning valley.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was the last holdout of our industrial age.\u201d</p> <p>The news was just the latest blow in a slow, painful decline in this area. The rust belt was a boom area at the start of the last century, but has suffered more than most from the outsourcing of jobs overseas. Stories of places like Lordstown abound in the midwest, and the angst and anger here is something Donald Trump was able to tap into in 2016 and that helped propel him into the White House.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I think it was the last holdout of our industrial age</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Sweetwoo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The closing of the Lordstown factory came after GM said it would cut 14,700 jobs across four plants in the midwest and Canada. That announcement, in November 2018, was in stark contrast to Trump\u2019s election <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4723610/trump-rally-youngstown\">pledge</a> to bring back auto jobs to the region.</p> <p>Today the plant, which looms behind a \u201cWelcome to Lordstown\u201d sign at the entry to the village, stands as a testament to the hollowness of that promise. In mid-August it was possible to drive into the complex, where huge parking lots \u2013 once full of new cars, but now completely empty, with brown weeds growing from cracks in the concrete \u2013 stretch as far as the eye can see.</p> <p>On one side of the factory was a huge sign declaring: \u201cLordstown, home of the Cruze\u201d. The plant was clad in dull yellow corrugated metal panels, adding to a sense of gloom on a grey, drizzly day.</p> <p>Lordstown is a small place, essentially a village with a gas station. Warren, five miles north, is more what one would traditionally think of as a town, with a main street, businesses and an impressive 19th-century county courthouse. Away from the pretty town center, however, some of the narrow roads are lined with abandoned homes, while buildings are in varying states of disrepair.</p> <p>It\u2019s a far cry from the golden years of the 20th century, when the Mahoning valley was colloquially known as Steel valley as the steel industry boomed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e98f07955b80013e066b4bf2331538f8a13c25c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e98f07955b80013e066b4bf2331538f8a13c25c6/0_0_3240_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A home with posters in support of President Trump is seen along Salt Springs Rd near the General Motors plant in Lordstown village.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A home with posters in support of President Trump is seen along Salt Springs Rd near the General Motors plant in Lordstown village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Salwan Georges/The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou could walk up and get a job. All my family worked in the steel mills. Everybody worked in the steel mills. You could go to any of those places any day and get a job,\u201d said Patricia Galgozy, who has lived in the area for over 80 years.</p> <p>Galgozy is the executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.trumbullartgallery.com/\">Turnbull Art Gallery</a>, in downtown Warren. The Foo Fighters rock star Dave Grohl, who was born in the town, recently attended a show there, and large framed photographs of him adorn the walls. The gallery, a non-profit, was in good shape, but Galgozy has seen how the area has changed.</p> <p>\u201cI see that impact constantly,\u201d Galgozy said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t find jobs, in my own family. You cannot find jobs around here many times. It does concern me. It makes me sad.\u201d</p> <p>Despite that, Galgozy says she is positive about the future.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean the quality of life doesn\u2019t stay with us,\u201d she said. \u201cI see that we\u2019re fighters. We step up and say what can we do.\u201d</p> <p>The Lordstown plant manufactured the Chevrolet Cruze, a cost-friendly compact car. It ceased production, with little warning, in March. Some workers were given the option to transfer to other GM plants, either by commuting or leaving the Mahoning valley entirely.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I see that we\u2019re fighters. We step up and say what can we do</p> <footer> <cite>Patricia Galgozy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is a chance that people could be employed at the factory again, with Workhorse, a small company which manufactures \u201chigh performance battery-electric vehicles\u201d, linked with buying the Lordstown plant. But Workhorse is beset by its own problems. The company <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/workhorse-group-reports-second-quarter-2019-results-20190806-00648\">recorded sales of just $6,000</a> in the second quarter of this year and lost $36.9m.</p> <p>The consequences of the GM closure are serious. Cleveland State University\u2019s Center for Economic Development <a href=\"https://www.csuohio.edu/news/assessing-economic-future-youngstown\">estimates</a> that the plant shutting down will have a negative impact of $8bn in the region. It doesn\u2019t help that other big employers have also recently left the area.</p> <p>\u201cWe also lost Allegiance Airlines in 2018. So we lost our airport \u2026 and the hospital shut down in 2018 as well,\u201d Sweetwood said. </p> <p>For longtime residents, the end of the GM era is all too familiar. When the US steel industry collapsed in the late 1970s, the area was decimated. As mills closed in nearby Youngstown and elsewhere, people left the area.

      "bodyText": "For years, the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, employed 8,000 workers in the Mahoning valley. In a rust belt region that has become synonymous with industrial decline, following the closure of its once mighty steel mills in the 1970s, the presence of the Chevrolet factory in Lordstown, and its well-paid manufacturing jobs, was particularly important. Then, late last year, GM abruptly shut the plant. The company had already scaled back workers at the Lordstown plant, and this closure saw 1,500 workers, the last of the once huge workforce, out of their jobs. \u201cI think it\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Mark Sweetwood, the managing editor of the Vindicator newspaper, which serves the Mahoning valley. \u201cI think it was the last holdout of our industrial age.\u201d The news was just the latest blow in a slow, painful decline in this area. The rust belt was a boom area at the start of the last century, but has suffered more than most from the outsourcing of jobs overseas. Stories of places like Lordstown abound in the midwest, and the angst and anger here is something Donald Trump was able to tap into in 2016 and that helped propel him into the White House. The closing of the Lordstown factory came after GM said it would cut 14,700 jobs across four plants in the midwest and Canada. That announcement, in November 2018, was in stark contrast to Trump\u2019s election pledge to bring back auto jobs to the region. Today the plant, which looms behind a \u201cWelcome to Lordstown\u201d sign at the entry to the village, stands as a testament to the hollowness of that promise. In mid-August it was possible to drive into the complex, where huge parking lots \u2013 once full of new cars, but now completely empty, with brown weeds growing from cracks in the concrete \u2013 stretch as far as the eye can see. On one side of the factory was a huge sign declaring: \u201cLordstown, home of the Cruze\u201d. The plant was clad in dull yellow corrugated metal panels, adding to a sense of gloom on a grey, drizzly day. Lordstown is a small place, essentially a village with a gas station. Warren, five miles north, is more what one would traditionally think of as a town, with a main street, businesses and an impressive 19th-century county courthouse. Away from the pretty town center, however, some of the narrow roads are lined with abandoned homes, while buildings are in varying states of disrepair. It\u2019s a far cry from the golden years of the 20th century, when the Mahoning valley was colloquially known as Steel valley as the steel industry boomed. \u201cYou could walk up and get a job. All my family worked in the steel mills. Everybody worked in the steel mills. You could go to any of those places any day and get a job,\u201d said Patricia Galgozy, who has lived in the area for over 80 years. Galgozy is the executive director of the Turnbull Art Gallery, in downtown Warren. The Foo Fighters rock star Dave Grohl, who was born in the town, recently attended a show there, and large framed photographs of him adorn the walls. The gallery, a non-profit, was in good shape, but Galgozy has seen how the area has changed. \u201cI see that impact constantly,\u201d Galgozy said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t find jobs, in my own family. You cannot find jobs around here many times. It does concern me. It makes me sad.\u201d Despite that, Galgozy says she is positive about the future. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean the quality of life doesn\u2019t stay with us,\u201d she said. \u201cI see that we\u2019re fighters. We step up and say what can we do.\u201d The Lordstown plant manufactured the Chevrolet Cruze, a cost-friendly compact car. It ceased production, with little warning, in March. Some workers were given the option to transfer to other GM plants, either by commuting or leaving the Mahoning valley entirely. There is a chance that people could be employed at the factory again, with Workhorse, a small company which manufactures \u201chigh performance battery-electric vehicles\u201d, linked with buying the Lordstown plant. But Workhorse is beset by its own problems. The company recorded sales of just $6,000 in the second quarter of this year and lost $36.9m. The consequences of the GM closure are serious. Cleveland State University\u2019s Center for Economic Development estimates that the plant shutting down will have a negative impact of $8bn in the region. It doesn\u2019t help that other big employers have also recently left the area. \u201cWe also lost Allegiance Airlines in 2018. So we lost our airport \u2026 and the hospital shut down in 2018 as well,\u201d Sweetwood said. For longtime residents, the end of the GM era is all too familiar. When the US steel industry collapsed in the late 1970s, the area was decimated. As mills closed in nearby Youngstown and elsewhere, people left the area. The population of Youngstown has halved since 1970, while Warren has lost almost a third of its residents. \u201cThe impact is going to hurt everybody in the community, little by little,\u201d said Al Tate, an 86-year-old who sells fruit and vegetables at the Warren farmer\u2019s market. Three of Tate\u2019s brothers lost their jobs when the mills closed in the late 1970s. Two of them left to find work, and never returned. \u201cOthers did the best they can, trying to make it,\u201d Tate said. He said people who have lost their jobs at GM now face difficult choices. \u201cThey\u2019re hurt now and they\u2019re going to hurt worse later after their [unemployment] benefits stop,\u201d Tate said. \u201cIf you ain\u2019t got nothing coming in, you\u2019ve got nothing to spend. If you\u2019ve never had to live week-to-week, from month-to-month, it\u2019s hard to understand.\u201d",

Speaking in Hanoi, where tensions have been rising over allegations of repeated Chinese incursions into Vietnamese-controlled waters, Morrison emphasised the importance of an \u201copen, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific neighbourhood\u201d. \u201cAn Indo-Pacific where we respect each other\u2019s sovereignty and independence, because if we allow the sovereignty or independence of any of our neighbours to suffer coercion, then we are all diminished,\u201d he said. \u201cWe share a deep interest in the stability and prosperity of our region.\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, this week criticised Australia for acting like a \u201ccondescending master\u201d towards Pacific countries, insulting climate-vulnerable nations and \u201cspreading the China threat fallacy among island countries\u201d. Geng accused Australian leaders of a cold war mentality towards China.",

Diogo Jota and Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez scored to help Wolves to a 3-2 victory at Torino that was a huge step towards reaching the Europa League group stage. Brooks Koepka, the four-times major winner, shot a 67 at East Lake to share the lead at the Tour Championship and said he was delighted with the results of a naked photoshoot for a magazine. Eddie Jones has paired Tom Curry and Sam Underhill together for the first time for England\u2019s Rugby World Cup warm-up against Ireland. And fans in rural New Zealand have raised concerns at how they will watch the World Cup in Japan given \u201cterrible\u201d internet reception in the rugby-mad nation, prompting the government to introduce legislation in a last-ditch effort to make the tournament more accessible. Business Hong Kong has a GDP bigger than many industrialised countries and is a world-class financial centre boasting a stock market with a total value of more than \u00a32.5tn. No wonder business is showing signs of nerves after 11 weeks of street protests (you can follow a day in the life of a protester here). The consultancy Capital Economics predicts a recession in the next quarter: \u201cRetail sales are particularly badly affected and mainland tourism has fallen,\u201d says Capital\u2019s Julian Evans-Pritchard. \u201cFour per cent of Hong Kong\u2019s GDP is from tourism and 75% of tourists are from the mainland and they\u2019ve stopped going because of the way the protests are portrayed there. We see this continuing deep into [the third quarter] with a technical recession \u2013 the first since the global financial crisis.\u201d On the markets overnight, Asian shares have struggled to make headway amid uncertainty over how much further the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Investors are keenly awaiting Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech at a gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, around 1pm UK time. The pound is worth around $1.222 and \u20ac1.104 while the FTSE is headed for a higher open. The papers Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit showdown with Emmanuel Macron is on the front of several of today\u2019s papers, including the Guardian: \u201cMacron tells Johnson Irish backstop is indispensable\u201d. The Telegraph\u2019s headline is \u201cJohnson demands fresh border plan\u201d. The i\u2019s splash is \u201cJohnson encounters French resistance\u201d. The Express carries an obscured picture of the PM, with his arms raised and fists clenched: \u201cBrexit victory salute\u201d it declares, saying Johnson can \u201crightly feel buoyant after winning over hardline Macron\u201d. The Sun and the Mirror both carry stories about Prince William\u2019s \u201cbudget\u201d holiday. \u201cWills gives Harry a flying lesson\u201d is the Sun\u2019s headline, noting the prince\u2019s family\u2019s budget flight after his \u201cbruv\u2019s private jet storm\u201d. The Mirror has \u201cWills &amp; Kate\u2019s \u00a373 hols flight\u201d. The Mail says \u201cWills and Kate\u2019s \u00a373 flight \u2013 and a first class lesson for Harry and Meghan\u201d, but it saves its splash for a health \u201cbreakthrough\u201d. Its headline is \u201cFour-in-one pill that slashes heart risk\u201d, reporting a combination of aspirin, statins and blood pressure drugs \u201ccould stop thousands dying\u201d. The Times leads on \u201cGirls close gender gap in science and tech\u201d, as it reports on Thursday\u2019s GCSE results in which the number of girls sitting computing exams \u201cjumped by 14% in one year\u201d.

The project has been monitoring whales, dolphins, porpoises and basking sharks off the west coast of Scotland for 17 years and holds the largest database of its kind for UK waters, adding to its records each year by systematically surveying the west coast. There are also dedicated sailings just for 16- and 17-year-olds.

Today, however, getting sand between your toes is an attraction in itself. Especially on <strong>30 August</strong>, at this year\u2019s Under The Pier art and nature event. It\u2019s a volunteer-powered survey of the marine wildlife in, on and under the pier, and finds can be identified with the help of professional ecologists, then verified, recorded and submitted to the <a href=\"https://iwnhas.org/\" title=\"\">Isle of Wight Natural History and Archaeological Society</a> (which maintains the island\u2019s species database).

Visitors can hear more about typical local species over a drink at the cafe, before joining experts to set moth traps around the trees in the late evening.

Many wildlife enthusiasts travel to the island specifically to spot them and, while the Mull Otter Group doesn\u2019t reveal known locations (to avoid disturbance), it encourages visitors to record otter sightings via its website. Reporting sightings helps the group better understand otter biology and ecology, encourage responsible otter watching, reduce otter road casualties and generally keep tabs on local otter populations. There\u2019s a better chance of spotting one of the glossy-backed creatures with one of local wildlife walk operator Mull Magic\u2019s Otter Detective Walks.

But rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification and the spread of non-native species are affecting seaweed health and distribution. To monitor this, the long-running Big Seaweed Project asks volunteers to visit British shorelines at low tide and record the seaweed, taking photographs and recording finds with a downloadable booklet.

The last of the summer\u2019s group events runs on 31 August (St Mawes by ferry from Prince of Wales Pier) but private sessions can also be arranged, therockpoolproject.co.uk Project Puffin, Skomer, Pembrokeshire Plan ahead for next summer and join the \u201cpuffarazzi\u201d with the RSPB. Between early June and late July 2020, visitors to the UK\u2019s puffin colonies will be asked to take photographs of birds with fish in their bills, making a note of the date, time and location and then uploading that information to a dedicated page on the RSPB\u2019s website. The idea is to help conservation scientist Dr Ellie Owen and her team pinpoint why puffin colonies are declining (the current thinking is that it is related to a reduction in food availability caused by climate change). The colonies include Skomer Island, in Pembrokeshire, to which the Wildlife Trust of South &amp; West Wales runs day trips between Easter and the end of September. \u2022 Boat fares from Martin\u2019s Haven to Skomer are \u00a311 adult, \u00a37 child, landing fee \u00a311 adult, \u00a35 child. Hostel-style overnight stay from \u00a330 adult, \u00a315 child.

The project has been monitoring whales, dolphins, porpoises and basking sharks off the west coast of Scotland for 17 years and holds the largest database of its kind for UK waters, adding to its records each year by systematically surveying the west coast. There are also dedicated sailings just for 16- and 17-year-olds. If a week is too long, the charity also runs the Whale Track initiative, whereby anyone visiting Scotland\u2019s west coast can record whale and dolphin sightings via a free app, helping to track the movements of different species. \u2022 From \u00a3950pp all-inclusive, hwdt.org Under The Pier, Isle of Wight When Ryde Pier opened in 1814, the idea was to offer foot passengers disembarking from boats an alternative to walking across a long stretch of wet sand to reach dry land (at low tide this was up to half a mile). Today, however, getting sand between your toes is an attraction in itself. Especially on 30 August, at this year\u2019s Under The Pier art and nature event. It\u2019s a volunteer-powered survey of the marine wildlife in, on and under the pier, and finds can be identified with the help of professional ecologists, then verified, recorded and submitted to the Isle of Wight Natural History and Archaeological Society (which maintains the island\u2019s species database). Along the way, younger visitors can sand-cast their own starfish or listen to the sea with a hydrophone. \u2022 3.30pm-6pm, free (take your own net), open to all ages, underthepier.space Moth Night, North Yorkshire This year marks the 20th anniversary of Moth Night, with a host of moth-counting activities across the country from 26 to 28 September. One of the most sociable events will be at the Yorkshire Arboretum, at Castle Howard near York, on 27 September. Visitors can hear more about typical local species over a drink at the cafe, before joining experts to set moth traps around the trees in the late evening. The group return the following morning to inspect the traps, record what is inside them and so help monitor species numbers and, potentially, identify the migration of species over time. \u2022 9pm-10.30pm, then 8am next day, \u00a34 adult, \u00a32 child, yorkshirearboretum.org, mothnight.info Mull Otter Group Otters are notoriously elusive but the island of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland, has over 300 miles of suitable coastal habitat and supports one of the highest densities of Eurasian otters in the UK. Many wildlife enthusiasts travel to the island specifically to spot them and, while the Mull Otter Group doesn\u2019t reveal known locations (to avoid disturbance), it encourages visitors to record otter sightings via its website. Reporting sightings helps the group better understand otter biology and ecology, encourage responsible otter watching, reduce otter road casualties and generally keep tabs on local otter populations. There\u2019s a better chance of spotting one of the glossy-backed creatures with one of local wildlife walk operator Mull Magic\u2019s Otter Detective Walks. Sightings aren\u2019t guaranteed but the idea behind the small-group tours is to help visitors responsibly look for, and learn about, otters. \u2022 mullottergroup.co.uk.

With plastic pollution now an issue on all the world\u2019s beaches, the need for this annual event is indisputable. It\u2019s not just about litter-picking, however. The Marine Conservation Society also collects data from the initiative to help support its campaigns (which have succeeded in introducing the plastic bag levy, a ban on microplastics in personal care products and better wet wipe labelling). Find an organised event using the map on the Marine Conservation Society website. Listings for group cleans currently range from Ballyhornan Beach in County Down to Gorleston in Norfolk. \u2022 Free, mcsuk.org Big Seaweed Search, nationwide The British Isles are home to more than 650 species of seaweed, which in turn create shelter and food for thousands of sea creatures, help protect coastlines from waves and are used in everything from foods to cosmetics. But rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification and the spread of non-native species are affecting seaweed health and distribution. To monitor this, the long-running Big Seaweed Project asks volunteers to visit British shorelines at low tide and record the seaweed, taking photographs and recording finds with a downloadable booklet. One of several citizen science projects organised by the Natural History Museum, this is run in conjunction with the Marine Conservation Society and can be done year-round by anyone living by \u2013 or holidaying beside \u2013 a beach. \u2022 Free, nhm.ac.uk Bamburgh Research Project, Northumberland While the majority of the UK\u2019s citizen science projects are wildlife-focused, history and culture are also subject areas. In Northumberland, for instance, the Bamburgh Research Project is a long-running archaeological field school where volunteers can help with the ongoing excavation of Bamburgh Castle (the principal palace-fortress of the medieval Kings of Northumbria) and the documenting of finds. An independent, not-for-profit initiative, it runs for six weeks in June and July each year (so plan ahead for 2020) and is especially suited to archaeology undergraduates looking for dig experience.

      "bodyText": "Major fires are burning this week in south-central Alaska, lengthening the state\u2019s wildfire season, which has usually ended by the beginning of August. They come after Alaska\u2019s hottest July on record, during which its largest city, Anchorage, had a temperature pass 90F (32C) for the first time. On top of that, the area has seen little rain this summer, resulting in extremely dry conditions. As firefighters tackle the blazes, officials are facing the longer term challenges of keeping the region safe amid increasing evidence of the impacts of the climate crisis. Wildfires are a growing concern around the country. According to the latest National Climate Assessment, hotter, drier conditions over the past two decades have led to more area being burned across the US. To make matters more perilous, since the 1990s, many millions of homes around the country have been built in or near forested areas, such as in the town of Paradise, California, the scene of a deadly wildfire last year. In Anchorage, which has a population of around 294,000, a few small fires have broken out within the city limits this summer. While much less destructive than this week\u2019s blazes in the south-central region, they gave officials notice of a growing new threat inside the city. \u201cAlaska residents in 2019 have dealt with more fire prone conditions, have dealt with more smoke, and have generally been more concerned and more aware of fire conditions,\u201d said Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. \u201cThey are wondering if this is a glimpse of a future, warmer Anchorage,\u201d Brettschneider said. Major fires Around 80 miles north of Anchorage, the over over 3700-acre (1500 hectare) McKinley Fire, which started over the weekend, continues to blaze. No casualties have been reported yet, but the fire has destroyed an estimated 80 structures so far. Many people living along the highway between Anchorage and Denali National Park have been forced to evacuate. Four other significant wildfires are also burning in the region surrounding Anchorage, choking the city with smoke. This week, the nearby Chugach Mountains were all but obscured from view, and the city health department issued advisories warning of unhealthy air conditions. Anchorage itself experienced a fire scare in early July, heralded by a plume of smoke rising from a wooded area on the east side of the city. Firefighters rushed to the scene and soon reported 60ft (18m) flames leaping from a black spruce forest. Helicopters and air tankers zoomed in to douse the quickly spreading blaze with water and fire retardant. Nearby homes were evacuated. Crews managed to contain the fire and in this case, no homes were lost. \u201cIt was scary,\u201d said John See, a forester with the Anchorage Fire Department. \u201cIt was a really high priority fire, in a bad place.\u201d This summer\u2019s wildfires are taking place amidst unusual conditions, to put it mildly. The July fire in Anchorage broke out at the start of what the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration described as \u201ca period of warmth that re-wrote the record books\u201d in Alaska. High temperatures persisted through August and little rain fell. Combined with especially high winds early this week, conditions were perfect for wildfires, worsening blazes that were already burning and stoking new ones. For the Anchorage area \u201cthe risk has always been there, but the risk is magnified tremendously,\u201d said climate scientist Brettschneider. This is the result of multiple factors, he said. Alaska\u2019s fire season is usually earlier than the season in the contiguous US, taking place in late spring and early summer. Humidity is lowest, as well as it being the driest and windiest time of year. What usually helps mitigate those conditions, Brettschneider said, is lingering snow cover. But due to global heating, snow in the Anchorage area is melting earlier, extending the length of the season. And as temperatures go up, conditions are getting even drier. \u201cEverything points to more fires, longer fire seasons and more intense fires,\u201d said Brettschneider. \u201cThere is no silver lining.\u201d Alaska on the front line As the Arctic warms twice as fast as the rest of the planet, Alaska as a whole is feeling the climate crisis more acutely than many other US states. Scientists are seeing indications that whole ocean ecosystems are being upended. In rural Alaska, frozen rivers used for wintertime travel are melting early, endangering lives.

In addition to wildfires, the city of Anchorage is trying to prepare for a laundry list of other near and long-term issues, outlined in the Climate Action Plan the city adopted this spring.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a common complaint among comedians that Edinburgh shows require not just jokes but emotional disclosure. So where does that leave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/24/darren-harriott-review-defiant-soho-theatre-london\">Darren Harriott</a>, an introvert who struggles to express emotion and, aged 30, has never been in love? On the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/21/edinburgh-comedy-awards-standups-prize-shortlist-nominees\">Comedy awards shortlist</a>, that\u2019s where. This black British standup from the Black Country (who opens strong with jokes about that identity) has been nominated for Good Heart Yute, tracing the prehistory of his stunted emotional life.</p> <p>We get an explanation for it early on. He grew up in a macho world, his mum neither hugged nor said she loved him \u2013 and, having been an obese teenager, he has a fear of rejection based on bitter experience. Harriott elicits coos of sympathy by describing playground games of kiss chase in which he did neither, and visits to the teen nightclub where he mistook an entanglement with a door handle for a longed-for romantic approach.</p> <p>This is the most engaging section of a show that later devolves into more generic standup: about gender education in schools, race and environmentalism and his grandad\u2019s seduction techniques.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a common complaint among comedians that Edinburgh shows require not just jokes but emotional disclosure. So where does that leave Darren Harriott, an introvert who struggles to express emotion and, aged 30, has never been in love? On the Comedy awards shortlist, that\u2019s where. This black British standup from the Black Country (who opens strong with jokes about that identity) has been nominated for Good Heart Yute, tracing the prehistory of his stunted emotional life. We get an explanation for it early on. He grew up in a macho world, his mum neither hugged nor said she loved him \u2013 and, having been an obese teenager, he has a fear of rejection based on bitter experience. Harriott elicits coos of sympathy by describing playground games of kiss chase in which he did neither, and visits to the teen nightclub where he mistook an entanglement with a door handle for a longed-for romantic approach. This is the most engaging section of a show that later devolves into more generic standup: about gender education in schools, race and environmentalism and his grandad\u2019s seduction techniques. Harriott is a likable host, but the line of his thinking isn\u2019t always clear and occasionally leads up blind alleys. There are some clunking segues and weak punchlines \u2013 such as the idea that as a hay fever sufferer he needn\u2019t care about the environment; or his soft spot for bigotry that comes with a catchy rhyme attached. But there\u2019s big-hitting material, too: a surprising take on Liam Neeson\u2019s vigilantism; a choice gag about drill music and criminality. It\u2019s a solid standup set, in short, with an emotional undertone that the chronic introvert probably deserves an award for revealing. Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August.

      "bodyText": "The corporate regulator has launched legal action against National Australia Bank seeking fines of up to $530m over a program the bank ran where it paid \u201cintroducers\u201d including gym instructors and hairdressers to bring in home loan customers. NAB\u2019s introducer program was closely examined during last year\u2019s banking royal commission, which heard evidence that the program helped contribute to fraud by bankers in western Sydney who were accepting cash kickbacks to write home loans. The lawsuit, filed with the federal court on Friday, is the second lodged by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission relating to the banking royal commission. Last month, it sued ANZ over an alleged transfer fee rip-off in a case that could cost that bank hundreds of millions of dollars. NAB made more than 46,000 home loans worth about $24bn as a result of the introducer program, Asic told the federal court. The regulator accused NAB of breaking the law 297 times by accepting detailed customer documentation, including payslips and tax returns, from introducers who did not have a credit licence. Some of this documentation was fraudulent, it said. Asic said 16 NAB bankers were involved in the alleged misconduct. \u201cThis conduct exposed the customers and NAB to the risk of wrongful conduct by the introducer, including possible fraud,\u201d Asic said in a concise statement filed with the court. \u201cIt also exposed customers to a risk that loans advanced to them would be unsuitable.\u201d The maximum penalty per breach is $1.8m.

Crennan said a special team within Asic was hard at work on royal commission-related investigations and he hoped to file \u201ca significant number of matters before Christmas\u201d. \u201cWe are seeing significant progress and we hope to be issuing some further proceedings in short order, that is, within weeks or months.\u201d NAB\u2019s chief legal counsel, Sharon Cook, said the bank would \u201ctake this legal action seriously and will now carefully assess the allegations\u201d. \u201cThroughout the Royal Commission we heard clearly that our actions need to change to meet the expectations of our customers and the community,\u201d she said. The royal commission heard that just four introducers, including a gym owner, were responsible for bringing $139m in loans to NAB. After the program blew up, 21 employees left the bank \u2013 10 of whom were sacked \u2013 and NAB reported suspected misconduct to police.

      "body": "<p>March for Our Lives, the national youth gun violence prevention movement founded by survivors of last year\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Florida, released a sweeping gun reform agenda this week.</p> <p>The agenda calls for significantly raising the standards for gun ownership in America, and reducing by about 100m the total number of guns in circulation.</p> <p>It\u2019s a dramatic, ambitious plan. And it may represent the first time in decades that the majority of Americans will get any real representation in the gun control debate in Washington.</p> <p>March for Our Lives\u2019 young activists endorsed an Australia-style mandatory government buyback and destruction of \u201cassault weapons\u201d. They want to decrease the number of guns in circulation by 30% \u2013 which would mean roughly 100m fewer firearms in American hands. They proposed regulations that would dramatically raise the bar for who is allowed to purchase a gun, putting US law much more in line with European countries. And they want to revisit the 2009 supreme court decision, District of Columbia v Heller, which enshrined a pro-gun interpretation of Americans\u2019 second amendment right to bear arms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/20/trump-gun-control-background-checks-shootings\">Trump flips stance on gun background checks, citing \u2018very strong\u2019 laws in place</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These proposals are substantially more aggressive, and more ambitious, than anything the Democrats in Washington have fought for in years. In fact, for decades, gun control groups and progressive politicians have done a poor job at representing the majority of Americans in Congress when it comes to gun control.</p> <h2>A surprising void</h2> <p>Democrats have fought for minor new restrictions on gun buying \u2013 and been defeated by the Republican party\u2019s gun absolutists \u2013 but, fundamentally, the Democratic party has remained supportive of gun ownership.</p> <p>Democratic lawmakers\u2019 efforts to \u201cban assault weapons\u201d, for example, have not meant an actual ban on these guns, but only a ban on future sales, meaning that Americans could keep the millions of military-style rifles they already own. President Obama\u2019s signature gun control legislation after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a compromise bill that would have closed just a few of the gaping loopholes in the nation\u2019s background check system \u2013 a measure so weak it\u2019s doubtful whether it would have had any effect on gun violence at all.</p> <p>The country\u2019s largest gun control groups, too,<strong> </strong>have made great efforts to portray themselves as pro-\u201cgun safety\u201d, not anti-gun. They routinely advertise themselves as supporters of Americans\u2019 second amendment right to bear arms. And they have focused on \u201ccommonsense reforms\u201d, such as getting what activists see as particularly extreme weapons off the streets, or requiring a criminal background check before every gun sale.</p> <p>This lack of any explicit anti-gun side in the American gun debate is strange.</p> <p>Although many Americans <a href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/05/07/americans-vastly-overestimate-the-number-of-gun-owners-thats-a-problem/\">may not realize it</a>, gun owners are a minority in the United States. American civilians overall own an estimated 300m to 400m firearms, more than one gun per person. But this frequently cited statistic obscures how concentrated American gun ownership is.</p> <p>In recent surveys, roughly <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/americas-complex-relationship-with-guns/\">70% to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/us-gun-ownership-survey\">80%</a> of Americans said they do not personally own a gun, and a majority said that nobody in their household owns a gun. Just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/gun-ownership-america-firearms-super-owners\">3% </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/gun-ownership-america-firearms-super-owners\">of American adults</a> own half the country\u2019s guns, according to a definitive 2015 survey. This small group of gun <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/15/the-gun-numbers-just-3-of-american-adults-own-a-collective-133m-firearms\">super-owners </a>have an average of 17 guns each.</p> <p>Gun absolutists \u2013 the activists who oppose any gun control measures, who want Americans to be able to own any kind of gun, and carry them everywhere \u2013 are a minority within that minority. According to the best available estimates, fewer than 10% of American gun owners overall are members of the National Rifle Association.</p> <p>There appear to be at least as many Americans who are vehemently anti-gun as there are NRA members.</p> <p>Recent Gallup polls have found that <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx\">28% of American adults</a> say they would support a law banning handgun ownership, except by the police and other \u201cauthorized persons\u201d. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 9% of American adults believed that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/americas-complex-relationship-with-guns/\">almost no one</a>\u201d should be legally allowed to own guns \u2013 about the same proportion as the number of adults who believed that \u201calmost everyone\u201d should be able to own them.</p> <p>A coalition of 9% of American adults would translate into more than 20 million people. That\u2019s a group four times larger than the NRA, which claims between 5 million and 6 million members.</p> <p>Only a minority of Americans oppose most private gun ownership. But there\u2019s strong majority support for much tougher gun control laws than the ones currently on the books.</p> <p>A 2017 Pew survey found <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/views-on-gun-policy/\">68% supported banning</a> assault-style weapons. Seventy-one percent supported having a federal database to track all gun sales. A <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx\">2018 Gallup survey </a>found 68% of respondents supported raising the legal age to buy certain guns. A <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2623\">Quinnipiac poll</a> in May found 77% of respondents were in favor of requiring people to obtain a license before being able to purchase a gun.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to find Americans who oppose the country\u2019s current gun culture. They show up at gun control rallies, holding signs that say things like \u201cRepeal the Second Amendment\u201d. They live in neighborhoods burdened by decades of daily gun violence. They\u2019ve lost family members or friends to shootings. They keep asking: why can\u2019t we just get rid of the guns?</p> <p>But for years, these Americans\u2019 views have not been well represented by America\u2019s \u201cgun safety\u201d groups, and they have had virtually no representation in Congress.</p> <p>This may finally be starting to change.</p> <h2>Moving the gun debate</h2> <p>In 2016, a progressive activist launched Guns Down America, a small organization that advocates not simply for \u201cgun sense laws\u201d, but for \u201ca future with fewer guns\u201d. Following the Parkland shooting, the young March for Our Lives activists have advocated unapologetically for bold reform, though they, like other American gun control activists, say they\u2019re not anti-gun and their proposals for stricter regulation represent the interests of \u201cresponsible gun owners\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not yet clear how much the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates will move towards embracing these majority opinions on gun control policy.

      "bodyText": "March for Our Lives, the national youth gun violence prevention movement founded by survivors of last year\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Florida, released a sweeping gun reform agenda this week. The agenda calls for significantly raising the standards for gun ownership in America, and reducing by about 100m the total number of guns in circulation. It\u2019s a dramatic, ambitious plan. And it may represent the first time in decades that the majority of Americans will get any real representation in the gun control debate in Washington. March for Our Lives\u2019 young activists endorsed an Australia-style mandatory government buyback and destruction of \u201cassault weapons\u201d. They want to decrease the number of guns in circulation by 30% \u2013 which would mean roughly 100m fewer firearms in American hands. They proposed regulations that would dramatically raise the bar for who is allowed to purchase a gun, putting US law much more in line with European countries. And they want to revisit the 2009 supreme court decision, District of Columbia v Heller, which enshrined a pro-gun interpretation of Americans\u2019 second amendment right to bear arms. These proposals are substantially more aggressive, and more ambitious, than anything the Democrats in Washington have fought for in years. In fact, for decades, gun control groups and progressive politicians have done a poor job at representing the majority of Americans in Congress when it comes to gun control. A surprising void Democrats have fought for minor new restrictions on gun buying \u2013 and been defeated by the Republican party\u2019s gun absolutists \u2013 but, fundamentally, the Democratic party has remained supportive of gun ownership. Democratic lawmakers\u2019 efforts to \u201cban assault weapons\u201d, for example, have not meant an actual ban on these guns, but only a ban on future sales, meaning that Americans could keep the millions of military-style rifles they already own. President Obama\u2019s signature gun control legislation after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a compromise bill that would have closed just a few of the gaping loopholes in the nation\u2019s background check system \u2013 a measure so weak it\u2019s doubtful whether it would have had any effect on gun violence at all. The country\u2019s largest gun control groups, too, have made great efforts to portray themselves as pro-\u201cgun safety\u201d, not anti-gun. They routinely advertise themselves as supporters of Americans\u2019 second amendment right to bear arms. And they have focused on \u201ccommonsense reforms\u201d, such as getting what activists see as particularly extreme weapons off the streets, or requiring a criminal background check before every gun sale. This lack of any explicit anti-gun side in the American gun debate is strange. Although many Americans may not realize it, gun owners are a minority in the United States. American civilians overall own an estimated 300m to 400m firearms, more than one gun per person. But this frequently cited statistic obscures how concentrated American gun ownership is. In recent surveys, roughly 70% to 80% of Americans said they do not personally own a gun, and a majority said that nobody in their household owns a gun. Just 3% of American adults own half the country\u2019s guns, according to a definitive 2015 survey. This small group of gun super-owners have an average of 17 guns each. Gun absolutists \u2013 the activists who oppose any gun control measures, who want Americans to be able to own any kind of gun, and carry them everywhere \u2013 are a minority within that minority. According to the best available estimates, fewer than 10% of American gun owners overall are members of the National Rifle Association. There appear to be at least as many Americans who are vehemently anti-gun as there are NRA members. Recent Gallup polls have found that 28% of American adults say they would support a law banning handgun ownership, except by the police and other \u201cauthorized persons\u201d. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 9% of American adults believed that \u201calmost no one\u201d should be legally allowed to own guns \u2013 about the same proportion as the number of adults who believed that \u201calmost everyone\u201d should be able to own them. A coalition of 9% of American adults would translate into more than 20 million people. That\u2019s a group four times larger than the NRA, which claims between 5 million and 6 million members. Only a minority of Americans oppose most private gun ownership. But there\u2019s strong majority support for much tougher gun control laws than the ones currently on the books. A 2017 Pew survey found 68% supported banning assault-style weapons. Seventy-one percent supported having a federal database to track all gun sales. A 2018 Gallup survey found 68% of respondents supported raising the legal age to buy certain guns. A Quinnipiac poll in May found 77% of respondents were in favor of requiring people to obtain a license before being able to purchase a gun. It\u2019s not hard to find Americans who oppose the country\u2019s current gun culture. They show up at gun control rallies, holding signs that say things like \u201cRepeal the Second Amendment\u201d. They live in neighborhoods burdened by decades of daily gun violence. They\u2019ve lost family members or friends to shootings. They keep asking: why can\u2019t we just get rid of the guns? But for years, these Americans\u2019 views have not been well represented by America\u2019s \u201cgun safety\u201d groups, and they have had virtually no representation in Congress. This may finally be starting to change. Moving the gun debate In 2016, a progressive activist launched Guns Down America, a small organization that advocates not simply for \u201cgun sense laws\u201d, but for \u201ca future with fewer guns\u201d. Following the Parkland shooting, the young March for Our Lives activists have advocated unapologetically for bold reform, though they, like other American gun control activists, say they\u2019re not anti-gun and their proposals for stricter regulation represent the interests of \u201cresponsible gun owners\u201d. It\u2019s not yet clear how much the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates will move towards embracing these majority opinions on gun control policy. But there\u2019s already been movement towards the actual middle of the debate. In 2016, Obama argued in a CNN Town Hall that \u201cissues like licensing, registration, that\u2019s an area where there\u2019s just not enough national consensus at this stage to even consider it\u201d. This year, the New Jersey senator Cory Booker made gun licensing the center of his 2020 gun control platform. After the mass shooting targeting Latino families in El Paso, the former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said he endorsed not just an assault weapon ban, but a mandatory federal buyback of assault weapons. On Wednesday, he became the first Democratic 2020 candidate to tweet that he supported March for Our Lives\u2019 new policy agenda. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign did not back away from the most controversial elements of the youth activists\u2019 plan, including their desire to revisit the supreme court\u2019s current interpretation of the second amendment, enshrined in the Heller decision. \u201cWhile Beto agrees with the court\u2019s holding that the second amendment allows for regulation, he does not agree with the entirety of the Heller decision,\u201d said Aleigha Cavalier, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s national press secretary. \u201cOne piece of the Heller case Beto believes should be revisited is the court\u2019s decision to strike down DC\u2019s safe storage requirements.\u201d America\u2019s gun debate may soon actually have two sides.",

On Wednesday, he spoke to the Guardian about his findings.</p> <p><em>The interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity</em>.</p> <p><strong>How did you go from physics to studying these social issues of violent extremism and online hate?</strong></p> <p>Most people think of physics as smashing things up into smaller and smaller pieces, but there\u2019s actually a whole wealth of physics which goes in the other direction and looks at what happens when you put things together. If I put molecules of water together, well, suddenly, I get a liquid and ice forms and icebergs form and the Titanic sinks. There\u2019s all sorts of consequences of what happens when you put together objects, good and bad.</p> <p>We have a tendency to want to pin blame on individual objects, but you would never do that in the physics world. There\u2019s no bad molecule that causes water to boil. It\u2019s a collective effect. And so, we wondered if a lot of the social problems that we face are actually better looked at through that lens.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The typical reaction is: 'But I\u2019m an individual, I don\u2019t behave like a molecule of milk.' Yeah, but collectively we do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>[For this study], we just naively said, well, what does the online world of hate look like? So we set about trying to work that out, and we found an unbelievable global network of hate.</p> <p>I study networks in biological systems, economic systems. This is the most complicated network I\u2019ve ever studied \u2013 tenfold more complicated \u2013 because it mixes geography, continents, languages, cultures and online platforms. Trying to police it within one platform is a little bit like saying if you take care of the weeds in your own garden, you can eliminate the problem from the neighborhood.</p> <p><strong>You talk about hate in terms of chemical bonds and \u201cgelation theory\u201d. How did you develop that framework?</strong></p> <p>These are not analogies. We looked at the behavior of the data, of the numbers, and saw that it is similar [to chemical bonding] not just because the numbers change in a certain way, but actually microscopically, in terms of interactions.</p> <p>If you have milk in the fridge, gradually, one day that milk suddenly curdles. That is because microscopically, you\u2019re getting this aggregation of objects into communities. And the math of that works perfectly well for the aggregation of people into communities. Now, the typical reaction is: \u201cOh, but I\u2019m an individual, I don\u2019t behave like a molecule of milk.\u201d Yeah, but collectively we do, because we\u2019re constrained by the others. So there\u2019s only a certain number of things that we can actually do, and we tend to do them again and again and again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d4a43eac9573b1e5ba78f896eaf93bce66b3dec3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4a43eac9573b1e5ba78f896eaf93bce66b3dec3/0_0_6427_3856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Johnson, professor of physics at George Washington University.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Johnson, professor of physics at George Washington University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Atkins/William Atkins/GWU</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So it\u2019s not an analogy. People say [online hate] is like cancer, it\u2019s like a virus, it\u2019s like this, it\u2019s like that \u2013 no. It\u2019s exactly like gelation, which is another way of saying the formation of bubbles.</p> <p><strong>How did you create your map? </strong><strong> </strong></p> <p>We started with a seed of clusters that were already banned on Facebook, such as the KKK. We looked at what other clusters they connect to that also connect back to them and kept going through this chain. </p> <p>We found there\u2019s a closed network of about 1,000 clusters, worldwide, online, across all platforms, propagating global hate of all flavors. Now, if there\u2019s about 1,000 people in each of those (it\u2019s actually between 10 and maybe up to 100,000, so let\u2019s just say 1,000 on average) you\u2019ve got 1,000 clusters of 1,000 people \u2013 that\u2019s a million people. And that\u2019s our very, very crude first estimate of the number of people online involved with this.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s a startlingly manageable number \u2013 1,000 networks.</strong></p> <p>Not if you\u2019re trying to find that among seven billion. But they\u2019ve already done the job for you. They\u2019ve already grouped themselves into community. </p> <p><strong>Do you have a list of those 1,000 groups?</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s what we built. I was expecting us never to end the process. But we got to the stage where we thought, my goodness, we\u2019ve mapped out the universe of online hate to some degree. Now we can begin to understand how interconnected things are and what things look like.</p> <p><strong>What was the range of ideology in these hate clusters? Is it mostly antisemitism, racism, white nationalism?</strong></p> <p>We thought we would see a discrete, well-defined set of boxes. But just as people haven\u2019t been able to categorize [mass] shooters in defined sets of boxes, we didn\u2019t find those online. Instead of it being like a menu of flavors, it\u2019s actually a continuous spectrum. And it\u2019s not a spectrum along the one line, it\u2019s multidimensional.</p> <p><strong>In the study, you describe forms of resilience by hate groups when they\u2019re threatened. Particularly concerning was this warning: \u201cPolicing within a single platform (such as Facebook) can make matters worse and will eventually generate global \u2018dark pools\u2019 in which online hate will flourish</strong><strong>.\u201d Can you describe how this works? What do you mean by a \u2018dark pool\u2019? Is that like 8Chan?</strong></p> <p>No, it\u2019s even worse. 8chan is a little bit of a remote island by itself. I\u2019m talking about dark pools forming within the major commercial platforms that we \u201ctrust\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you remove randomly 10% of the members globally, this thing will begin to fall apart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the KKK got banned from Facebook, they were looking for a platform, and suddenly, there was this welcoming committee on [the Russian social network] VK. It was like orientation week in college [with people saying], \u201cWe\u2019ll hold your hand, we\u2019ll take you to see the community, and you\u2019ll find what you want here.\u201d They\u2019re now in a kind of close-knit group like freshman orientation, and they quickly can develop bonds to discuss what was it that got them banned, and therefore how to avoid it when they go back in.</p> <p>One of the adaptations was they then reinserted themselves into Facebook with a simple change of writing the name [KKK] in Cyrillic, the Russian alphabet. It looks pretty similar and yet a machine-learning algorithm doesn\u2019t know about Cyrillic. It\u2019s clever.</p> <p><strong>How did you come up with your four policy proposals?</strong></p> <p>If I want to stop water boiling, I don\u2019t have to stop individual molecules from jumping up into the steam, I have to stop the bubbles from forming. We know that the big bubbles form from the smaller ones. And the big bubble today becomes old news for the next generation.</p> <p>[The first proposal] is to go after the smaller bubbles. Smaller bubbles are weaker, have less money, less powerful people, and will grow into those big ones. So eliminating small ones \u2013 and we showed this mathematically \u2013 rapidly decreases the ecology. It cuts off the supply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a04f3857c16a6b9f5de80a3a023cf3b9f6d4da3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a04f3857c16a6b9f5de80a3a023cf3b9f6d4da3/0_170_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People gather to protest the far right in Chicago after the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People gather to protest the far right in Chicago after the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Number two is that instead of banning individuals, because of the interconnectedness of this whole system, we showed that you actually only have to remove about 10% of the accounts to make a huge difference in terms of the cohesiveness of the network. If you remove randomly 10% of the members globally, this thing will begin to fall apart.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a really interesting idea. It also seems a</strong><strong> bit fraught in terms of our general understanding of what is fair, to say that just 10% of the people engaging in a specific negative behavior should be punished.</strong></p> <p>Ostensibly all of the people involved in this have broken the terms of service of the platform, so all of the people should, in principle, have their accounts removed. Facebook\u2019s trying to remove them all anyway. Our push is, just don\u2019t go after the most important people first.</p> <p><strong>Your second proposal involves deploying \u201canti-hate clusters\u201d to engage with hate groups. How could that work?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/11/el-paso-shooting-white-supremacy-8chan-voter-suppression\">How white supremacy went mainstream in the US: 8chan, Trump, voter suppression</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You get [the hate clusters] engaged in a skirmish, basically, and they think that that\u2019s a kind of supreme battle. It slows them down in terms of recruiting; it just engages them in something that actually isn\u2019t that important.</p> <p><strong>So you\u2019re saying that fighting with trolls online is actually worth your time?</strong></p> <p>Right. But do it as a group, do it as a cluster. Don\u2019t do it individually. It will break you.</p> <p><strong>Are there examples of this that you\u2019ve observed where it\u2019s been effective?</strong></p> <p>I haven\u2019t. Like I said, this comes out of the idea of: how do I cancel a bubble? Well, there\u2019s no such thing as an anti-bubble. But there is in physics the idea of just getting two [opposites] together and they should neutralize each other. They form a tightly bound pair, the plus and the minus.</p> <p>[The fourth proposal] is my favorite because it it really exploits the weakness that comes from the multidimensional flavors of hate. There are two neo-Nazi groups, both in the UK, both ostensibly wanting the same thing. But they don\u2019t \u2013 one wants a unified Europe, the other wants to break everything apart and obliterate the rest of the countries. So introduce a cluster that draws out the differences. I don\u2019t think that [the introduced cluster] would necessarily contain members of the public unless they were trained in some way. But it will certainly contain people who use good psychology, social psychology, and know some history that could actually engage.</p> <p><strong>That strategy sounds like some of the tactics that the FBI used under <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-fbis-war-on-civil-rights-leaders\">Cointelpro</a> when it was trying to pit different sectors of the civil rights movement against each other and taking advantage of potential ideological divisions to create a splintering effect.</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t know that [history], and I certainly wouldn\u2019t want it to be used in some bad way. But I see it as a way to wear individuals in hate clusters out. In the end, they\u2019ll just get fed up. It\u2019s not that it goes away. It\u2019s just that now they\u2019re actually hating the traffic more than they hate the Jews. It shifts the focus.</p>",

If I put molecules of water together, well, suddenly, I get a liquid and ice forms and icebergs form and the Titanic sinks. There\u2019s all sorts of consequences of what happens when you put together objects, good and bad. We have a tendency to want to pin blame on individual objects, but you would never do that in the physics world. There\u2019s no bad molecule that causes water to boil. It\u2019s a collective effect. And so, we wondered if a lot of the social problems that we face are actually better looked at through that lens. [For this study], we just naively said, well, what does the online world of hate look like? So we set about trying to work that out, and we found an unbelievable global network of hate. I study networks in biological systems, economic systems. This is the most complicated network I\u2019ve ever studied \u2013 tenfold more complicated \u2013 because it mixes geography, continents, languages, cultures and online platforms. Trying to police it within one platform is a little bit like saying if you take care of the weeds in your own garden, you can eliminate the problem from the neighborhood. You talk about hate in terms of chemical bonds and \u201cgelation theory\u201d. How did you develop that framework? These are not analogies. We looked at the behavior of the data, of the numbers, and saw that it is similar [to chemical bonding] not just because the numbers change in a certain way, but actually microscopically, in terms of interactions. If you have milk in the fridge, gradually, one day that milk suddenly curdles. That is because microscopically, you\u2019re getting this aggregation of objects into communities. And the math of that works perfectly well for the aggregation of people into communities. Now, the typical reaction is: \u201cOh, but I\u2019m an individual, I don\u2019t behave like a molecule of milk.\u201d Yeah, but collectively we do, because we\u2019re constrained by the others. So there\u2019s only a certain number of things that we can actually do, and we tend to do them again and again and again. So it\u2019s not an analogy. People say [online hate] is like cancer, it\u2019s like a virus, it\u2019s like this, it\u2019s like that \u2013 no. It\u2019s exactly like gelation, which is another way of saying the formation of bubbles. How did you create your map? We started with a seed of clusters that were already banned on Facebook, such as the KKK. We looked at what other clusters they connect to that also connect back to them and kept going through this chain. We found there\u2019s a closed network of about 1,000 clusters, worldwide, online, across all platforms, propagating global hate of all flavors. Now, if there\u2019s about 1,000 people in each of those (it\u2019s actually between 10 and maybe up to 100,000, so let\u2019s just say 1,000 on average) you\u2019ve got 1,000 clusters of 1,000 people \u2013 that\u2019s a million people. And that\u2019s our very, very crude first estimate of the number of people online involved with this. That\u2019s a startlingly manageable number \u2013 1,000 networks. Not if you\u2019re trying to find that among seven billion. But they\u2019ve already done the job for you. They\u2019ve already grouped themselves into community. Do you have a list of those 1,000 groups? That\u2019s what we built. I was expecting us never to end the process. But we got to the stage where we thought, my goodness, we\u2019ve mapped out the universe of online hate to some degree. Now we can begin to understand how interconnected things are and what things look like. What was the range of ideology in these hate clusters? Is it mostly antisemitism, racism, white nationalism? We thought we would see a discrete, well-defined set of boxes. But just as people haven\u2019t been able to categorize [mass] shooters in defined sets of boxes, we didn\u2019t find those online. Instead of it being like a menu of flavors, it\u2019s actually a continuous spectrum. And it\u2019s not a spectrum along the one line, it\u2019s multidimensional. In the study, you describe forms of resilience by hate groups when they\u2019re threatened. Particularly concerning was this warning: \u201cPolicing within a single platform (such as Facebook) can make matters worse and will eventually generate global \u2018dark pools\u2019 in which online hate will flourish.\u201d Can you describe how this works? What do you mean by a \u2018dark pool\u2019? Is that like 8Chan? No, it\u2019s even worse. 8chan is a little bit of a remote island by itself. I\u2019m talking about dark pools forming within the major commercial platforms that we \u201ctrust\u201d. When the KKK got banned from Facebook, they were looking for a platform, and suddenly, there was this welcoming committee on [the Russian social network] VK. It was like orientation week in college [with people saying], \u201cWe\u2019ll hold your hand, we\u2019ll take you to see the community, and you\u2019ll find what you want here.\u201d They\u2019re now in a kind of close-knit group like freshman orientation, and they quickly can develop bonds to discuss what was it that got them banned, and therefore how to avoid it when they go back in. One of the adaptations was they then reinserted themselves into Facebook with a simple change of writing the name [KKK] in Cyrillic, the Russian alphabet. It looks pretty similar and yet a machine-learning algorithm doesn\u2019t know about Cyrillic. It\u2019s clever. How did you come up with your four policy proposals? If I want to stop water boiling, I don\u2019t have to stop individual molecules from jumping up into the steam, I have to stop the bubbles from forming. We know that the big bubbles form from the smaller ones. And the big bubble today becomes old news for the next generation. [The first proposal] is to go after the smaller bubbles. Smaller bubbles are weaker, have less money, less powerful people, and will grow into those big ones. So eliminating small ones \u2013 and we showed this mathematically \u2013 rapidly decreases the ecology. It cuts off the supply. Number two is that instead of banning individuals, because of the interconnectedness of this whole system, we showed that you actually only have to remove about 10% of the accounts to make a huge difference in terms of the cohesiveness of the network. If you remove randomly 10% of the members globally, this thing will begin to fall apart. It\u2019s a really interesting idea. It also seems a bit fraught in terms of our general understanding of what is fair, to say that just 10% of the people engaging in a specific negative behavior should be punished. Ostensibly all of the people involved in this have broken the terms of service of the platform, so all of the people should, in principle, have their accounts removed. Facebook\u2019s trying to remove them all anyway. Our push is, just don\u2019t go after the most important people first. Your second proposal involves deploying \u201canti-hate clusters\u201d to engage with hate groups. How could that work? You get [the hate clusters] engaged in a skirmish, basically, and they think that that\u2019s a kind of supreme battle. It slows them down in terms of recruiting; it just engages them in something that actually isn\u2019t that important. So you\u2019re saying that fighting with trolls online is actually worth your time? Right. But do it as a group, do it as a cluster. Don\u2019t do it individually. It will break you. Are there examples of this that you\u2019ve observed where it\u2019s been effective? I haven\u2019t. Like I said, this comes out of the idea of: how do I cancel a bubble? Well, there\u2019s no such thing as an anti-bubble. But there is in physics the idea of just getting two [opposites] together and they should neutralize each other. They form a tightly bound pair, the plus and the minus. [The fourth proposal] is my favorite because it it really exploits the weakness that comes from the multidimensional flavors of hate. There are two neo-Nazi groups, both in the UK, both ostensibly wanting the same thing. But they don\u2019t \u2013 one wants a unified Europe, the other wants to break everything apart and obliterate the rest of the countries. So introduce a cluster that draws out the differences. I don\u2019t think that [the introduced cluster] would necessarily contain members of the public unless they were trained in some way. But it will certainly contain people who use good psychology, social psychology, and know some history that could actually engage. That strategy sounds like some of the tactics that the FBI used under Cointelpro when it was trying to pit different sectors of the civil rights movement against each other and taking advantage of potential ideological divisions to create a splintering effect. I don\u2019t know that [history], and I certainly wouldn\u2019t want it to be used in some bad way. But I see it as a way to wear individuals in hate clusters out. In the end, they\u2019ll just get fed up. It\u2019s not that it goes away. It\u2019s just that now they\u2019re actually hating the traffic more than they hate the Jews. It shifts the focus.",

      "body": "<p>Rooted in Caribbean culture and introduced to the UK by the Windrush generation, sound systems \u2013 static or truck-bound collectives of MCs and DJs playing music through customised, bass-heavy speakers \u2013 have been integral to Notting Hill carnival since 1973. Organiser Leslie Palmer introduced them alongside live bands to appeal to a youthful audience, instantly creating the event\u2019s unique vibe.</p> \n<p>This year, 36 systems will operate simultaneously from Kensal Road right down to Westbourne Grove, playing an array of music stretching from reggae and ska through Latin and soca to house, drum\u2019n\u2019bass and grime. We spoke to a selection of sound system operators about their colourful beginnings, what they are playing this year, and why an event that began in 1959 is still unique and vital.</p> \n<h2><strong>King Tubby\u2019s</strong><strong>: \u2018The first year my speakers got smashed\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Cecil Rennie:</strong> \u201cI came to this country aged 12, from Jamaica \u2013 the journey made by the first British sound systems. I helped out on Duke Reid\u2019s system in Tooting before starting my own in 1970, building it up speaker by speaker. Every sound system in England was named after one in Jamaica in tribute, so I named mine after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/jul/16/1\" title=\"\">King Tubby</a>, my idol. I lived on the same street \u2013 Stansfield Road in Stockwell \u2013 as the young David Bowie, and when we played the system in our garage he used to hang out and listen. I got records before they were released and was the first person in the UK to get the artist to call the sound system name over the music, which I did with I-Roy. In them times we had DJs on the microphone \u2013 like early rapping.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"719254b8-797d-486a-a260-eb2f0937602a\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(January 30, 1959)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taking place in 1958, shortly after the race riots in London, Trinidadian human rights activist Claudia Jones put on an indoor \u2018Caribbean carnival\u2019 at St Pancras town hall.

There was a ruction and all my speaker boxes got smashed when the crowd started running. Nowadays I play reggae, soul and calypso, but I\u2019ve played Simply Red, the Rolling Stones and even the Beatles over a reggae beat. In the beginning, I invited my white schoolfriends down and it\u2019s still a multiracial club. A lot of the reason reggae has become popularised internationally is down to carnival and sound systems. Now I\u2019m bringing young guys through like Duke Reid did for me. I\u2019ll only stop doing it when I can\u2019t walk.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Gaz\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Blues: \u2018It was pretty wild in those days\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Gary Mayall:</strong> \u201cI went to my first carnival in 1976 and have only missed one since. My brother Jason and I started the Globe club on Talbot Road and in 1990 we started getting involved with carnival and put a sound system on the street outside. It was pretty wild in those days, but things grew and grew and we\u2019ve been on the same spot ever since. The sound system is a relative of our club <a href=\"https://www.gazrockin.com/gass-rockin-blues\" title=\"\">Gaz\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Blues</a> in Soho, the longest running one-nighter in London. At carnival we play strictly vinyl, classic and obscure reggae and ska and old R&amp;B, which takes people back to what the first Jamaicans in Britain danced to. You can feel the music in your stomach.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery year we have a theme. One year my brother was moving office and said he was too busy to do carnival. I said: \u2018But Jason, we\u2019re doing cowboys and Indians this year. I\u2019ve got two 26ft teepees, 50 cowboy hats and loads of toy bows and arrows. All we need is a fort.\u2019 His eyes rolled, but five minutes later he\u2019d made a model fort out of matchsticks and we were off. In 2016 a construction company built us a huge ship to do \u2018the Windrush generation\u2019. This year we\u2019ve got a huge scale model of the Houses of Parliament. Maybe we\u2019ll do a better job of running it than the politicians.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b585d4e01ced3f59186076658ffbcdfce9addec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b585d4e01ced3f59186076658ffbcdfce9addec/0_0_3728_5549/672.jpg\" alt=\"Women dancing at a sound system at Notting Hill carnival.\" width=\"672\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Metro Glory (Science of Sound): \u2018They said I was playing mad music\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Nigel Sterling:</strong> \u201cOne day my dad came back from Jamaica with <a href=\"https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr/product/u-roy-version-galore_2\" title=\"\">U-Roy\u2019s Version Galore</a> album, which I played until I wore it out. Hackney was full of sound systems then. There were 10 to 15 in the Kingsmead estate alone. I\u2019d get my Sunday school clothes grubbed up from listening to them. From a young age I told people: \u2018I\u2019m gonna have one of the biggest sound systems in England.\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cI chose physics, electronics art and woodwork at school, so I could design and construct it, and built my first speakers using wood left behind on building sites. Every sound system is different \u2013 you design what is in your head. I called it Trojan then.</p> \n<p>\u201cI first did carnival in 1989, just drove up and played under a garage on Westbourne Park Road. We try to entertain everybody and it\u2019s about positive music, food and dancing. I\u2019ve played every genre. I was the first reggae sound in my area to play house, garage and jungle. I got cussed and told I was playing \u2018mad music\u2019. Two years later, everyone was playing it.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Sir Lloyd: \u2018It\u2019s 2,000 watts and I want to double it\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Lloyd Roberts:</strong> \u201cIn 1976 I started Trinity Rockers sound with my classmates at Kennington boys\u2019 school. When they packed it in I went solo. My mum\u2019s friend suggested the name Sir Lloyd. Sometimes I played alongside Jazzie\u2019s Soul II Soul and Trevor Nelson\u2019s Madhatters sound. At one point my crew had 14 people and my sister was an MC, Sister Candy. In the 70s I played reggae, soul and calypso but in the 80s I started playing hip-hop tunes such as Grandmaster Flash\u2019s The Message and Gary Byrd\u2019s The Crown, which led to funky house, jungle and drum\u2019n\u2019bass. Now we play bashment and Afrobeats, too.</p> \n<p>\u201cI first played carnival in 85 or 86. It\u2019s been much more regulated since a man was stabbed to death in 87, but it\u2019s still carnival. We\u2019ve had people like Sean Paul, Lily Allen and Craig David DJing and singing. My sound system is currently 2,000 watts and I want to double it. Jamaican sound systems set the trend for sub-bass \u2013 some go up to 9,000 or more \u2013 it\u2019s crazy out there! \u2013 but we can hold our own. Pirate radio hurt sound systems culture for a while, but then we realised we could coexist \u2013 it\u2019s all about spreading the music.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/nottingh_ss_map/giv-3902rKw2hj109U0D/\" data-alt=\"Sound system map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/nottingh_ss_map/giv-3902rKw2hj109U0D/\">Sound system map</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Latin Rave Street Jam: \u2018People go: What kind of music is this?\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Sylvester Harrison:</strong> \u201cWe used to bunk off school to hear [Kiss FM founder] <a href=\"https://mi-soul.com/george-power-founder-of-kiss-fm-has-died/\" title=\"\">George Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/13/paul-trouble-anderson-obituary\" title=\"\">Paul \u2018Trouble\u2019 Anderson</a>\u2019s lunchtime club from 12-3 at Cracker\u2019s on Wardour Street \u2013 heavy funk and boogie jazz.

I\u2019m not a typical sound system person. My background is in theatre arts and pageants, but I brought that to carnival. We\u2019re one of the few sound systems that straddle disciplines, so we have a sound system, DJs, live acts and our own costumed band, the Bride. We go live from noon until 7pm and I treat the sound system as a seven-hour concert.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe play various types of gospel, which is incredibly powerful and can stretch to rap, grime, house and Afrobeats, celebrating carnival\u2019s roots in the Caribbean and before that Africa and the connection with the church. Our DJs have ranged from ex-BBC 1Xtra gospel presenter DJ Fitz to DJs Edu and Asante. This year we\u2019ll have a female DJ, <a href=\"http://www.djshunz.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Shunz</a>. Women are starting to DJ much more. We have an open-mic gospel-singing competition, which is so much fun that people can\u2019t wait to get the mic off each other.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople say that carnival and church don\u2019t mix but I think that Jesus would have been at carnival, getting the good news across to people. For two days the streets belong to the residents and the people, and I would hope that the residents bear with us for that one weekend in a year. There\u2019s nothing like carnival.

      "bodyText": "Rooted in Caribbean culture and introduced to the UK by the Windrush generation, sound systems \u2013 static or truck-bound collectives of MCs and DJs playing music through customised, bass-heavy speakers \u2013 have been integral to Notting Hill carnival since 1973. Organiser Leslie Palmer introduced them alongside live bands to appeal to a youthful audience, instantly creating the event\u2019s unique vibe. This year, 36 systems will operate simultaneously from Kensal Road right down to Westbourne Grove, playing an array of music stretching from reggae and ska through Latin and soca to house, drum\u2019n\u2019bass and grime. We spoke to a selection of sound system operators about their colourful beginnings, what they are playing this year, and why an event that began in 1959 is still unique and vital. King Tubby\u2019s: \u2018The first year my speakers got smashed\u2019 Cecil Rennie: \u201cI came to this country aged 12, from Jamaica \u2013 the journey made by the first British sound systems. I helped out on Duke Reid\u2019s system in Tooting before starting my own in 1970, building it up speaker by speaker. Every sound system in England was named after one in Jamaica in tribute, so I named mine after King Tubby, my idol. I lived on the same street \u2013 Stansfield Road in Stockwell \u2013 as the young David Bowie, and when we played the system in our garage he used to hang out and listen. I got records before they were released and was the first person in the UK to get the artist to call the sound system name over the music, which I did with I-Roy. In them times we had DJs on the microphone \u2013 like early rapping. \u201cI first played carnival in 1973 or 1974. There was a ruction and all my speaker boxes got smashed when the crowd started running. Nowadays I play reggae, soul and calypso, but I\u2019ve played Simply Red, the Rolling Stones and even the Beatles over a reggae beat. In the beginning, I invited my white schoolfriends down and it\u2019s still a multiracial club. A lot of the reason reggae has become popularised internationally is down to carnival and sound systems. Now I\u2019m bringing young guys through like Duke Reid did for me. I\u2019ll only stop doing it when I can\u2019t walk.\u201d Gaz\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Blues: \u2018It was pretty wild in those days\u2019 Gary Mayall: \u201cI went to my first carnival in 1976 and have only missed one since. My brother Jason and I started the Globe club on Talbot Road and in 1990 we started getting involved with carnival and put a sound system on the street outside. It was pretty wild in those days, but things grew and grew and we\u2019ve been on the same spot ever since. The sound system is a relative of our club Gaz\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Blues in Soho, the longest running one-nighter in London. At carnival we play strictly vinyl, classic and obscure reggae and ska and old R&amp;B, which takes people back to what the first Jamaicans in Britain danced to. You can feel the music in your stomach. \u201cEvery year we have a theme. One year my brother was moving office and said he was too busy to do carnival. I said: \u2018But Jason, we\u2019re doing cowboys and Indians this year. I\u2019ve got two 26ft teepees, 50 cowboy hats and loads of toy bows and arrows. All we need is a fort.\u2019 His eyes rolled, but five minutes later he\u2019d made a model fort out of matchsticks and we were off. In 2016 a construction company built us a huge ship to do \u2018the Windrush generation\u2019. This year we\u2019ve got a huge scale model of the Houses of Parliament. Maybe we\u2019ll do a better job of running it than the politicians.\u201d Metro Glory (Science of Sound): \u2018They said I was playing mad music\u2019 Nigel Sterling: \u201cOne day my dad came back from Jamaica with U-Roy\u2019s Version Galore album, which I played until I wore it out. Hackney was full of sound systems then. There were 10 to 15 in the Kingsmead estate alone. I\u2019d get my Sunday school clothes grubbed up from listening to them. From a young age I told people: \u2018I\u2019m gonna have one of the biggest sound systems in England.\u2019 \u201cI chose physics, electronics art and woodwork at school, so I could design and construct it, and built my first speakers using wood left behind on building sites. Every sound system is different \u2013 you design what is in your head. I called it Trojan then. \u201cI first did carnival in 1989, just drove up and played under a garage on Westbourne Park Road. We try to entertain everybody and it\u2019s about positive music, food and dancing. I\u2019ve played every genre. I was the first reggae sound in my area to play house, garage and jungle. I got cussed and told I was playing \u2018mad music\u2019. Two years later, everyone was playing it.\u201d Sir Lloyd: \u2018It\u2019s 2,000 watts and I want to double it\u2019 Lloyd Roberts: \u201cIn 1976 I started Trinity Rockers sound with my classmates at Kennington boys\u2019 school. When they packed it in I went solo. My mum\u2019s friend suggested the name Sir Lloyd. Sometimes I played alongside Jazzie\u2019s Soul II Soul and Trevor Nelson\u2019s Madhatters sound. At one point my crew had 14 people and my sister was an MC, Sister Candy. In the 70s I played reggae, soul and calypso but in the 80s I started playing hip-hop tunes such as Grandmaster Flash\u2019s The Message and Gary Byrd\u2019s The Crown, which led to funky house, jungle and drum\u2019n\u2019bass. Now we play bashment and Afrobeats, too. \u201cI first played carnival in 85 or 86. It\u2019s been much more regulated since a man was stabbed to death in 87, but it\u2019s still carnival. We\u2019ve had people like Sean Paul, Lily Allen and Craig David DJing and singing. My sound system is currently 2,000 watts and I want to double it. Jamaican sound systems set the trend for sub-bass \u2013 some go up to 9,000 or more \u2013 it\u2019s crazy out there! \u2013 but we can hold our own. Pirate radio hurt sound systems culture for a while, but then we realised we could coexist \u2013 it\u2019s all about spreading the music.\u201d Latin Rave Street Jam: \u2018People go: What kind of music is this?\u2019 Sylvester Harrison: \u201cWe used to bunk off school to hear [Kiss FM founder] George Power and Paul \u2018Trouble\u2019 Anderson\u2019s lunchtime club from 12-3 at Cracker\u2019s on Wardour Street \u2013 heavy funk and boogie jazz. My DJ mate Baz for Jazz introduced me to Gilles Peterson \u2013 we played jazz together at the Wag Club and I got further into Latin, which nobody was playing at carnival. One year I got a couple of speakers and just set up on Portobello Road, which you could do then, and the system grew from there. \u201cI must have done at least 25 carnivals now and it\u2019s such a calm, beautiful vibe. Some people go: \u2018What kind of music is this? I\u2019ve never heard anything like it before\u2019, which is brilliant. We\u2019ve had the London School of Samba play with us with drums and whistles. One year this old man came up and said: \u2018I\u2019ve lived in the carnival area for 40 years and never heard anyone play jazz. I heard you from streets away, followed the sound and you were playing Miles Davis. It made my day.\u2019\u201d Arts-A-Light: \u2018Jesus would have gone to carnival\u2019 Angela Essien: \u201cI started running the sound system 10 years ago. I\u2019m not a typical sound system person. My background is in theatre arts and pageants, but I brought that to carnival. We\u2019re one of the few sound systems that straddle disciplines, so we have a sound system, DJs, live acts and our own costumed band, the Bride. We go live from noon until 7pm and I treat the sound system as a seven-hour concert. \u201cWe play various types of gospel, which is incredibly powerful and can stretch to rap, grime, house and Afrobeats, celebrating carnival\u2019s roots in the Caribbean and before that Africa and the connection with the church. Our DJs have ranged from ex-BBC 1Xtra gospel presenter DJ Fitz to DJs Edu and Asante. This year we\u2019ll have a female DJ, Shunz. Women are starting to DJ much more. We have an open-mic gospel-singing competition, which is so much fun that people can\u2019t wait to get the mic off each other. \u201cPeople say that carnival and church don\u2019t mix but I think that Jesus would have been at carnival, getting the good news across to people. For two days the streets belong to the residents and the people, and I would hope that the residents bear with us for that one weekend in a year. There\u2019s nothing like carnival. On our mobile truck, we\u2019ve turned tracks like Graham Kendrick\u2019s Heaven Is in My Heart into soca, creating gospelly soca just for carnival. We attract anyone who wants a taste of the event and a family-friendly environment for their kids.\u201d Rough But Sweet: \u2018I\u2019ve never seen a cross word\u2019 Michael Lamond: \u201cI went to my first carnival in 1982, was instantly hooked and wanted to become part of it. I was a DJ for about five years and then I found someone who could build my first speakers and I started running the sound system with several others.

Take, for example, the case of Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/19/elton-john-defends-harry-and-meghan-over-use-of-private-jets\" title=\"\">use of private jets,</a> and what it says about their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/31/prince-harry-talking-population-royal-family-two-children\" title=\"\">environmental credentials</a>. Once we might have understood that the rich would say and do things in their own rich fashion, and it was worth it for those things to be done; now it seems wealth is used to discredit ethical arguments by the wealthy. Groups are disbarred from collective ambition because their privilege sets them outside the collective.</p> <p>If we carry on like this, there will be no one left to do anything worth doing; even having the time for activism puts you in the zone of privilege because the \u201ctruly oppressed\u201d don\u2019t have that luxury. And so the principle is established: the ultimate political statement is the personal life, and personal acts can fatally undermine political claims.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been here before. The personal became the political <a href=\"http://www.carolhanisch.org/CHwritings/PIP.html\" title=\"\">in a 1970 essay</a> by the US second-wave feminist Carol Hanisch. Her point was quite specific: she was responding to the argument that when women talked from personal experience \u2013 of abortion, domestic violence, unmeetable beauty standards, household drudgery, the whole suite of female oppression \u2013 it was \u201ctherapeutic\u201d rather than political. There was a view, at that time, on the left and also in areas of feminism, that women\u2019s consciousness-raising was fringe stuff, politically speaking. It wasn\u2019t worthless but, belonging in the realm of personal experience, it was up to individuals to resolve at that level. There was another, less judgmental, view that these problems were all rooted in women\u2019s social conditioning. At least that located oppression where it belonged, in society, but it still situated the solutions within the individual who ought, once her consciousness had been raised, to be able to slough off the conditioning that was oppressing her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f2fc482c6a5bc3dab1eda90d7dd25e9ba3f8b9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f2fc482c6a5bc3dab1eda90d7dd25e9ba3f8b9a/0_362_2333_1400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were criticised for their use of private jets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were criticised for their use of private jets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hanisch\u2019s counter-argument was basically a Marxist materialist one: if you want to understand how and why people are oppressed, you have to ask who benefits from their oppression. If you think it\u2019s trivial who did the washing up and had their professional prospects dimmed as a result, you have to ask who didn\u2019t do it. If you think women\u2019s reproductive rights are a personal matter, you have to ask who gains societally from the power imbalance created from their restriction.</p> <p>This analysis was exquisitely uncomfortable, because it left no respite: you couldn\u2019t logically be domestically subjugated while publicly fighting for the emancipation of all. In the 1970s, in that spirit, it was virtually de rigueur for feminists to pursue strategic squalor (a memory: my first stepmother\u2019s friends used to serve us squash out of used yoghurt pots, which themselves hadn\u2019t been washed, in protest against needless washing up. It was truly a terrible time to be the child of a feminist if you liked squash).</p> <p>The idea that \u201cthe personal is political\u201d has always made demands that were exceptionally hard to live by. Yet what it emphatically never meant is what it has become: an injunction that until you are living perfectly, according to the values you espouse, you are a hypocrite and an irrelevance. There\u2019s a logical impossibility at the heart of this new norm: to change society, you have to exist in it; yet to do so involves compromising with its imperfections, whereupon you supposedly become just a cog in its workings.</p> <p>This erects an impossible barrier to entry: if you\u2019re not Jesus (or perhaps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/petertatchell\" title=\"\">Peter Tatchell</a>), you\u2019re not bona fide. Hanisch\u2019s point, by contrast, was inclusive above all: if everything you experience is political then it is all part of the same struggle and the same solidarity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~mserra/AttachedFiles/PersonalPolitical.pdf\" title=\"\">Reflecting in 2006</a> on her original essay, Hanisch wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s necessary that theories take their knocks in the real world, like everything else,\u201d but that this one in particular had been turned on its head, deliberately misused. Some challenges were made in good faith. When Paula Rust, another second-wave feminist, wrote: \u201cOne\u2019s personal choices reveal or reflect one\u2019s personal politics; one should make personal choices that are consistent with one\u2019s personal politics; personal life and personal politics are indistinguishable,\u201d she was <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X2ETCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA329&amp;lpg=PA329&amp;dq=One%E2%80%99s+personal+choices+reveal+or+reflect+one%E2%80%99s+personal+politics;+one+should+make+personal+choices+that+are+consistent+with+one%E2%80%99s+personal+politics;+personal+life+and+personal+politics+are+indistinguishable&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nVE4ErED9D&amp;sig=ACfU3U0dWMqKUOLWSMRfm9l8txg7MFNQ4Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjI_uvs8JbkAhWEThUIHVkzA_UQ6AEwC3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=One%E2%80%99s%20personal%20choices%20reveal%20or%20reflect%20one%E2%80%99s%20personal%20politics%3B%20one%20should%20make%20personal%20choices%20that%20are%20consistent%20with%20one%E2%80%99s%20personal%20politics%3B%20personal%20life%20and%20personal%20politics%20are%20indistinguishable&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">pushing at the limits of the idea</a>. But that was in the context of sexuality within the movement \u2013 specifically, the extent to which one\u2019s sexual and political orientation could and should align (much of her work was centred on the political flashpoints between lesbian and bisexual women).</p> <p>Rust\u2019s sentiment has been shifted far away from its time and place. It\u2019s been re-appropriated in a cynical move to taint everyone, dampen any hope of change, poison every ambition. And this has been particularly corrosive to environmentalism, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/05/environmentally-friendly-green-living-ideas\" title=\"\">compromises that activists necessarily make</a> take up more discursive energy than the crisis itself. This undermining of green politics needs to be named for what it is and resisted. Feminism had no deadline, it was a struggle that could move fast or slow according to passion, agility, the alignment of the stars. Environmentalism is all deadline: if those who oppose action can procrastinate by fixating on imponderables \u2013 which of us is sufficiently without sin? \u2013 then their victory will be total.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/12/nigel-farage-brexit-party-prince-harry\">Nigel Farage attacking Prince Harry is like the angry man ranting on a bus | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The answer is not to strive for greater individual perfection, but to return to that first materialist analysis: who benefits from climate inaction?

Recently the cacophony has become deafening. Take, for example, the case of Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s use of private jets, and what it says about their environmental credentials. Once we might have understood that the rich would say and do things in their own rich fashion, and it was worth it for those things to be done; now it seems wealth is used to discredit ethical arguments by the wealthy. Groups are disbarred from collective ambition because their privilege sets them outside the collective. If we carry on like this, there will be no one left to do anything worth doing; even having the time for activism puts you in the zone of privilege because the \u201ctruly oppressed\u201d don\u2019t have that luxury. And so the principle is established: the ultimate political statement is the personal life, and personal acts can fatally undermine political claims. We\u2019ve been here before. The personal became the political in a 1970 essay by the US second-wave feminist Carol Hanisch. Her point was quite specific: she was responding to the argument that when women talked from personal experience \u2013 of abortion, domestic violence, unmeetable beauty standards, household drudgery, the whole suite of female oppression \u2013 it was \u201ctherapeutic\u201d rather than political. There was a view, at that time, on the left and also in areas of feminism, that women\u2019s consciousness-raising was fringe stuff, politically speaking. It wasn\u2019t worthless but, belonging in the realm of personal experience, it was up to individuals to resolve at that level. There was another, less judgmental, view that these problems were all rooted in women\u2019s social conditioning. At least that located oppression where it belonged, in society, but it still situated the solutions within the individual who ought, once her consciousness had been raised, to be able to slough off the conditioning that was oppressing her. Hanisch\u2019s counter-argument was basically a Marxist materialist one: if you want to understand how and why people are oppressed, you have to ask who benefits from their oppression. If you think it\u2019s trivial who did the washing up and had their professional prospects dimmed as a result, you have to ask who didn\u2019t do it. If you think women\u2019s reproductive rights are a personal matter, you have to ask who gains societally from the power imbalance created from their restriction. This analysis was exquisitely uncomfortable, because it left no respite: you couldn\u2019t logically be domestically subjugated while publicly fighting for the emancipation of all. In the 1970s, in that spirit, it was virtually de rigueur for feminists to pursue strategic squalor (a memory: my first stepmother\u2019s friends used to serve us squash out of used yoghurt pots, which themselves hadn\u2019t been washed, in protest against needless washing up. It was truly a terrible time to be the child of a feminist if you liked squash). The idea that \u201cthe personal is political\u201d has always made demands that were exceptionally hard to live by. Yet what it emphatically never meant is what it has become: an injunction that until you are living perfectly, according to the values you espouse, you are a hypocrite and an irrelevance. There\u2019s a logical impossibility at the heart of this new norm: to change society, you have to exist in it; yet to do so involves compromising with its imperfections, whereupon you supposedly become just a cog in its workings. This erects an impossible barrier to entry: if you\u2019re not Jesus (or perhaps Peter Tatchell), you\u2019re not bona fide. Hanisch\u2019s point, by contrast, was inclusive above all: if everything you experience is political then it is all part of the same struggle and the same solidarity. Reflecting in 2006 on her original essay, Hanisch wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s necessary that theories take their knocks in the real world, like everything else,\u201d but that this one in particular had been turned on its head, deliberately misused. Some challenges were made in good faith. When Paula Rust, another second-wave feminist, wrote: \u201cOne\u2019s personal choices reveal or reflect one\u2019s personal politics; one should make personal choices that are consistent with one\u2019s personal politics; personal life and personal politics are indistinguishable,\u201d she was pushing at the limits of the idea. But that was in the context of sexuality within the movement \u2013 specifically, the extent to which one\u2019s sexual and political orientation could and should align (much of her work was centred on the political flashpoints between lesbian and bisexual women). Rust\u2019s sentiment has been shifted far away from its time and place. It\u2019s been re-appropriated in a cynical move to taint everyone, dampen any hope of change, poison every ambition. And this has been particularly corrosive to environmentalism, where the compromises that activists necessarily make take up more discursive energy than the crisis itself. This undermining of green politics needs to be named for what it is and resisted. Feminism had no deadline, it was a struggle that could move fast or slow according to passion, agility, the alignment of the stars. Environmentalism is all deadline: if those who oppose action can procrastinate by fixating on imponderables \u2013 which of us is sufficiently without sin? \u2013 then their victory will be total. The answer is not to strive for greater individual perfection, but to return to that first materialist analysis: who benefits from climate inaction? Whose status is maintained by political inertia? Whose structures render personal efforts insufficient? Take the fight back to politics, where it belongs. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

This year rights for the World Cup have been bought by telecommunications giant Spark, who will livestream games on a special website, Spark Sport, for a one-off fee of NZ$80. But tens of thousands of New Zealanders in rural and remote areas say they will be unable to stream the tournament due to slow internet speeds, and are concerned they will miss out on the event.

A spokesperson for Spark said it had signed a deal with free-to-air TVNZ for the All Blacks pool games to play with a one-hour delay, and the semi-final and final \u2013 if Steve Hansen\u2019s side feature \u2013 to air live and free. \u201cThere is a small minority who may not be able to stream it \u2013 and that many of these people live rural areas and are passionate rugby fans,\u201d said a Spark spokesperson. \u201cThe Rugby World Cup is a highly anticipated event on every rugby fan\u2019s calendar. Ensuring pubs who want to show the Rugby World Cup at their premises can stay open for the matches will mean more rugby all round \u2013 which we see as a good thing for New Zealanders.\u201d But Connors said the new streaming arrangement had not been tested and Spark had a poor track record of delivering for rural Kiwis. \u201cCan Spark deliver? That\u2019s the big question at the moment. Everyone is concerned. They\u2019re striking a lot of problems. This is the first time they\u2019ve done it \u2013 that\u2019s a hell of a gamble.\u201d",

We see Swift progress from wide-eyed 13-year-old (\u201cI heart school!\u201d) to one of the world\u2019s biggest stars: the latter the source of considerable woe. There are complaints about fans outside her house, worries about her relationships failing due to \u201cthe nasty world that just wants to ruin things\u201d and about 2016, when her personal woes, including her mother\u2019s cancer diagnosis, were compounded by public spats with other artists \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/09/kanye-west-taylor-swift-instagram-politics-trump-democrats\">most notably Kanye West</a> \u2013 a succession of think-pieces bemoaning her awfulness and, most mind-boggling of all, her unsolicited adoption as a figurehead of the American alt-right after she declined to endorse a presidential candidate. \u201cThis summer,\u201d she writes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/09/taylor-swift-reputation-can-new-album-save-her-name\">from the thick of it</a>, \u201cis the apocalypse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bca38a892a42adcddc6b74dbdabd0c336587c550\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bca38a892a42adcddc6b74dbdabd0c336587c550/0_0_3900_3900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift: Lover album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of Lover</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The album that resulted from said apocalypse, 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/10/taylor-swift-reputation-review-superb-songcraft-meets-extreme-drama\">Reputation</a>, was a messy, uneven explosion of bitterness and cynicism amid the love songs, on which Swift\u2019s desire for public redress sometimes overwhelmed her songwriting smarts: you could understand why her mouth tended to purse itself into a cat\u2019s bum of disapproval, but by the time you got to This Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things, a dressing-down of a former friend now expelled from Swift\u2019s life of champagne-swilling luxury, it was hard not to wish she\u2019d give it a rest. Under these circumstances, you\u2019d be forgiven for heaving a weary sigh as Lover\u2019s opening track I Forgot That You Existed springs into life. We seem to be back exactly where we left off: another perfidious ex-pal getting it in the neck, to the accompaniment of jaunty piano and brittle-sounding laughter.</p> <p>It\u2019s a strange way to open Lover, because it\u2019s a misnomer: if Swift can\u2019t keep the lemon out of her gob entirely \u2013 You Need to Calm Down is a forgettable bit of how-dare-you, in which the actions of celeb-baiting internet trolls get mixed up with those of homophobes \u2013 the tone of Lover is noticeably different from its predecessor, the bitterness largely expunged in favour of besotted paeans to her British partner, actor Joe Alwyn. He gets hymned in every conceivable way, from the Mazzy Star-ish title track to London Boy, on which an artist once unironically labelled America\u2019s Sweetheart slips charmingly into the British vernacular \u2013 it\u2019s all \u201cdown the pub\u201d this and \u201chis best mate\u201d that and \u201cI fancy you\u201d the other.</p> <p>Indeed, it\u2019s tempting to say he\u2019s hymned a little too much. The big problem with Lover is that it\u2019s too long, the suspicion being that Swift is trying to reassert her commercial dominance by spread-betting. Reputation represented a relative sales wobble, shifting a mere 4.5m copies as opposed to 1989\u2019s 10m, and she\u2019s recently signed a new record deal, of which Lover is the first fruit. Fans who like her best in snarkily defensive mode can wallow in I Forgot That You Existed and You Need to Calm Down. Listeners who pine for the less-knowing Swift, her lyrical focus on romance, are thrown a bone in the widescreen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/st-vincent\">St Vincent</a>-assisted synth pop of Cruel Summer, which fixes her relationship with Alwyn in terms of sneaking in through garden gates and drunk tears in the back of a car. Those who think it all went wrong when she left Nashville and fixed her sights on pop can console themselves with Soon You\u2019ll Get Better, a gorgeous, hushed country ballad about her mother\u2019s illness, bedecked with banjo, fiddle and backing vocals by the Dixie Chicks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkk9gvTmCXY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dkk9gvTmCXY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkk9gvTmCXY\">Taylor Swift: You Need to Calm Down \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Those who want her to be a straightforward mainstream pop star, meanwhile, get the single Me!, which nearly hospitalises itself trying to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/26/taylor-swifts-me-is-a-musical-inspired-return-to-her-happily-uncool-brand\">a crowd-rousing anthem</a> built in the image of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/20/the-greatest-showman-review-pt-barnum-hugh-jackman\">The Greatest Showman</a> soundtrack. You can understand the pragmatic impulse to cover every base, but not even Taylor Swift, usually possessed of far higher quality control than her peers, can muster enough knockout tunes to fill 18 tracks. The bravura displays of songwriting \u2013 not least The Archer, a brilliant, echo-drenched exercise in mounting tension that teases, but never reaches, an explosive climax \u2013 are padded out with pretty lightweight stuff: Death By a Thousand Cuts, by-numbers pop elevated a little by a piano part that flutters delicately in the background; the new wave-y misfire Paper Rings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/22/taylor-swift-six-albums-scooter-braun\">Taylor Swift's great re-recording plot: icy revenge or a pointless setback?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, another section of her fanbase \u2013 those who keep loudly insisting that Swift fix her lyrical gaze on bigger issues \u2013 are certainly catered for. We\u2019re living through one of those weird moments in history when it\u2019s deemed that pop stars need to have Something to Say About the State of Things. Perhaps noting the ensuing acres of guff suggesting most of them they haven\u2019t got anything original or thought-provoking to say at all, Swift has thus far declined to join in, but here changes her mind. The feminist-flavoured The Man has an If I Were a Boy-esque lyrical conceit, snappy and exasperated in equal measure. Miss Americana &amp; the Heartbreak Prince, meanwhile, is one of the best things here, not a phrase regularly associated with pop\u2019s attempts to get to grips with the horrors of 2019. It takes a classic Swift lyrical trope \u2013 the Springsteen-y one in which two young sweethearts vow to leave their small town \u2013 and retools it to reflect the abandon-ship despair engendered by Trump\u2019s America. Audibly indebted to Lana Del Rey, it\u2019s infinitely smarter and subtler than anything her peers can manage when pushing the button marked \u201cwoke\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/23/taylor-swift-trump-thinks-his-presidency-autocracy\">Taylor Swift: Trump thinks his presidency is an autocracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That said, Lover\u2019s highlights come when Swift ignores the outside world, whether that\u2019s politics, public image or the desire to reassert her pop dominance. False God is beautiful and strangely subdued: an introverted small-hours love song on which a rambling sax solo weaves around Swift\u2019s voice. It\u2019s Nice to Have a Friend, meanwhile, sounds like nothing else Swift has made before, a brief sliver of a song set to samples of steel pan, tubular bells and a Canadian kids\u2019 choir. They hint at another album, buried amid Lover\u2019s landslide of styles and lyrical approaches, more subtle and low-key and experimental, but potentially more satisfying.</p> <p>As it is, Lover offers plenty of evidence that Swift is just a better songwriter than any of her competitors in the upper echelons of pop, but its something-for-everyone approach feels like consolidation, not progress, designed to keep Swift as one of the world\u2019s biggest stars without provoking the kind of backlash that led her to start evoking the end of days in her diary.</p>",

Miss Americana &amp; the Heartbreak Prince, meanwhile, is one of the best things here, not a phrase regularly associated with pop\u2019s attempts to get to grips with the horrors of 2019. It takes a classic Swift lyrical trope \u2013 the Springsteen-y one in which two young sweethearts vow to leave their small town \u2013 and retools it to reflect the abandon-ship despair engendered by Trump\u2019s America. Audibly indebted to Lana Del Rey, it\u2019s infinitely smarter and subtler than anything her peers can manage when pushing the button marked \u201cwoke\u201d. That said, Lover\u2019s highlights come when Swift ignores the outside world, whether that\u2019s politics, public image or the desire to reassert her pop dominance. False God is beautiful and strangely subdued: an introverted small-hours love song on which a rambling sax solo weaves around Swift\u2019s voice. It\u2019s Nice to Have a Friend, meanwhile, sounds like nothing else Swift has made before, a brief sliver of a song set to samples of steel pan, tubular bells and a Canadian kids\u2019 choir. They hint at another album, buried amid Lover\u2019s landslide of styles and lyrical approaches, more subtle and low-key and experimental, but potentially more satisfying. As it is, Lover offers plenty of evidence that Swift is just a better songwriter than any of her competitors in the upper echelons of pop, but its something-for-everyone approach feels like consolidation, not progress, designed to keep Swift as one of the world\u2019s biggest stars without provoking the kind of backlash that led her to start evoking the end of days in her diary.",

The slow-motion pursuit took place on Wednesday in the small town of Timaru on the east coast of the South Island.

      "bodyText": "The damage to 2GB\u2019s bottom line from Alan Jones\u2019s tirade about the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is serious. According to media tracking service Aircheck, the number of commercials across the station for the first three days this week was down 441 on the same period two weeks ago. Before Jones said Scott Morrison should \u201cshove a sock down her throat\u201d, 2GB had 2,228 ads over three days. This week the number had dropped to 1,787. On Jones\u2019s own breakfast program, from 5.30am to 9am, the ad tally dropped from 343 spots two weeks ago to 308 this week \u2013 that\u2019s 35 paid ads down. The figures show that when Jones said advertisers who chose to abandon him would be replaced by others, he was wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve got no comment about the advertisers, they can make their own judgment if they go,\u201d a defiant Jones told Nine News on Tuesday. \u201cThere will be others that take their place.\u201d A social media campaign, bolstered by Mad Fucking Witches, which has more than 51,000 members on Facebook, and activist group Sleeping Giants on Twitter, has led to more than 40 companies pulling their advertising spend from Jones and or the station. Consumers continue to target the advertisers who are still appearing on Jones by bombarding them with comments across social media. Jones cheerleaders rev up But Jones still has his defenders in the media, including former Sunrise commentator Prue MacSween and former Labor senator and Sky News contributor Graham Richardson. MacSween infamously appeared in a widely condemned Sunrise segment that discussed the stolen generations, where she suggested \u201cwe need to do it again, perhaps\u201d. More recently she called Nick Kyrgios a \u201cspoilt little Greek brat\u201d. Richo, for his part, wrote a defence of Jones for the Australian. He also took up the theme of Jones being the people\u2019s hero. It followed a similar vein to another pro-Jones column Richo wrote just a few months back, which read more like a love letter: \u201cHis days start at 3am and most nights find him speaking to an audience rapt in the rapid-fire delivery and the passionate nature of his well-chosen words.\u201d This week Richo wrote: \u201cJones does get things wrong but for the most part he champions the causes of people who have little or no clout in today\u2019s society.\u201d The piece was received with howls of derision. \u201cNo he doesn\u2019t,\u201d said ABC journalist Virginia Trioli. \u201cHe uses his privilege and power to make people with \u2018no clout\u2019 afraid, cynical and distrusting of democratic institutions such as governments, courts, schools and public servants. He\u2019s something akin to an anarchist, really.\u201d And former News Corp journalist turned critic Tony Koch said: \u201cRichardson talking crap. Alan Jones has made a career out of bullying people, particularly women and the powerless.\u201d Sponsorship stoush The widow of the late, great Age investigative reporter David Wilson, Jo Nicholls, says she was was hurt and disappointed after the Melbourne Press Club dumped her family trust in favour of a more lucrative sponsorship from the Commonwealth Bank. The club hosts the Quill awards for excellence in Victorian journalism across 29 categories including the young journalist of the year award, which Wilson\u2019s family has sponsored for eight years. Nicholls set up the Wilnic Family Trust after David died aged 58 in 2008 in recognition of Wilson\u2019s work with young journalists in the Age newsroom. The prize for the award was a trip to the annual Investigative Reporters and Editors conference in the US, as Wilson had been the first Australian reporter to attend the conference and bring back skills about computer-assisted reporting. Wilson was the co-author, with Lindsay Murdoch in 1984, of a series of reports known as The Age Tapes, which led to seven separate inquiries, including a royal commission. The Walkley-award winner was head of the paper\u2019s investigative unit, Insight, for 10 years. Nicholls was blindsided when she received an email from press club chief executive, Mark Baker, telling her the Commonwealth Bank wanted to sponsor the young journalist of the year award to the tune of more than $20,000 a year \u2013 but only if they had \u201cbranding rights\u201d. Baker offered her a different award \u2013 the student journalist \u2013 to sponsor, but she refused because Wilson was not a fan of journalism schools as they existed then. A recent offer from Nicholls to move the family\u2019s sponsorship to the investigative Quill award was rejected and negotiations broke down despite an intervention from club president Adele Ferguson. The irony of Ferguson winning a Gold Walkley for her exposure of the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s \u201cunconscionable banking practices\u201d is not lost on anyone. Baker told Weekly Beast the unfortunate dispute meant the award had no sponsor this year and the Commonwealth Bank decided to come on board as a premium sponsor instead of an award sponsor. \u201cWe tried tried sincerely to continue the relationship with Jo by offering her the sponsorship of the student journalism of the year award to honour the memory of David Wilson, who was a close friend and colleague of mine at the Age,\u201d Baker said. Snap verdict It didn\u2019t take Andrew Bolt long to be outraged by the decision of the Victorian court of appeal to dismiss George Pell\u2019s appeal. \u201cI am appalled\u201d, he wrote on his Herald Sun blog within minutes of the decision being handed down. Which almost certainly indicates he hadn\u2019t read the 300-page judgment. Bolt was soon popping up on Sky\u2019s breaking news coverage from outside the courthouse in Melbourne, where he told Kieran Gilbert he did not believe Pell was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. He was shocked and disappointed because he had hoped the court would \u201cstand against the mob and the media witch hunt\u201d to set Pell free. In his column the next day Bolt highlighted the clergy who had been wrongly convicted, and said he had lost all faith in the justice system. \u201cThey say it\u2019s an insult to victims to doubt an accusation, but Pell would not be the first priest who has been unfairly accused,\u201d Bolt said. Conservative commentator and men\u2019s rights campaigner Bettina Arndt produced a mock movie poster starring George Pell as the wronged hero: \u201ca [sic] exploration of modern day hysteria\u201d. Too good to be true There was a heart-warming yarn in Newsweek this week that got a lot of attention.

Hogg quit after protests in Hong Kong led to a plunge in the airline\u2019s share price and it came under pressure from Chinese authorities to rein in employees who were supporting the pro-democracy demonstrators. Later the magazine added a correction of sorts to the article. \u201cThis story has been updated to reflect that Taiwan News was the source of the story about Hogg\u2019s refusal, and to include the new Cathay Pacific CEO\u2019s comments.\u201d Not quite shipshape An intriguing correction on the ABC website disclosed that a radio report and an online article managed to scramble a news story by confusing the country of origin of a tanker that was detained in Gibraltar. \u201cOn 21 August, 2019 one radio news story and a related online story incorrectly stated that an Iranian tanker was detained in Gibraltar in retaliation for the seizure of a British ship. The British tanker was seized in retaliation for the seizure of the Iranian ship.\u201d Final question for McEvoy The founding executive producer of Q&amp;A, Peter McEvoy, is retiring ahead of a shake-up of the Monday night forum after the departure of host Tony Jones later this year. McEvoy, the winner of five Walkley awards, including the Gold Walkley, created the program 13 years ago and has steered it through 400 episodes and its endless controversies and run-ins with government, including when the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, banned his ministers from appearing on the show. Abbott said it was \u201cout of control\u201d and a \u201clefty lynch mob\u201d after former terrorism suspect Zaky Mallah asked Coalition MP Steve Ciobo a question. ABC managing director David Anderson said Q&amp;A was the most successful discussion-based national affairs program in ABC history. \u201cPeter has made an incredibly significant contribution to public broadcasting and national current affairs,\u201d he said. News director Gaven Morris told staff McEvoy\u2019s move \u201cmeans a period of significant change for Q&amp;A and an opportunity for us to take a fresh look at this important program\u201d. Sources say the refreshed show will be produced out of Melbourne and Sydney next year, possibly with two hosts sharing the duties. Q&amp;A has been dogged in recent years by the tag \u201cthe bad show\u201d by critics who say it is trivial, populist and gives a platform to people who are divisive and ill-informed.",

Most begin to make their way home. \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d protesters yell. Wong joins them, heading back to the MTR. He says he will miss these moments of unity. It\u2019s not clear what form the protests will take after September, when school begins for many of the young demonstrators. \u201cOf course we will remember what happened this summer,\u201d he says, but worries his fellow protesters could lose their passion. He refers to chief executive Carrie Lam, who also participated in social movements when she was a student. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid we could become the people we hated so much,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are trying to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. We will keep reminding ourselves why we stood on the streets this summer.\u201d * Name has been changed to protect the identity of the interviewee",

      "bodyText": "Rugby Australia is willing to bet the farm on the Wallabies winning the World Cup in Japan. The 31-man World Cup squad announced on Friday includes two players \u2013 utility back James O\u2019Connor and halfback Nic White \u2013 who were eligible under the so-called Giteau Law. Wallabies coach Michael Cheika devised the policy in 2015 to allow overseas-based players to be eligible to play for the Wallabies. He brought back Matt Giteau, for whom the law was named, and Drew Mitchell back from France for the World Cup that year. Previously, players had to play for Super Rugby clubs in Australia to be eligible to play for the Wallabies, but the Giteau Law created a whole new pool of offshore talent by relaxing the eligibility rules. Under it, overseas players who have played 60 Tests or commit to an Australian Super Rugby team for two years after the World Cup qualify for selection. O\u2019Connor (Sale Sharks) and White (Exeter) were specifically targeted for the Wallabies World Cup squad. Two players may not sound like a lot, but it is worth remembering that Cheika was involved in unsuccessful, last-minute negotiations to bring second-rower Will Skelton back from English club Saracens, while veteran hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau (Leicester) was also under serious consideration. Another World Cup squad member Matt Toomua became eligible by returning from England to play for the Melbourne Rebels this year, but he only played five Super Rugby games towards the end of the season. In the past Toomua would have to have started the Super Rugby season to be eligible, but that rule was also watered down somewhere along the line. So there could easily have been up to four or five overseas based players in the Wallabies\u2019 squad for the tournament in Japan. Cheika cannot be blamed for assembling the strongest squad possible, including players from home and abroad, to give the team its best chance of winning the World Cup, but Australian rugby faces potentially serious consequences, unintended or not, as a result of the loosening of the eligibility rules. There was a good reason overseas players were excluded from the Wallabies prior to the introduction of the Giteau Law \u2013 to protect Super Rugby. The number of players selected for the Wallabies under the Giteau Law is not really the main concern \u2013 it is more the growing number of players leaving Australia after the World Cup and that the Giteau Law is inadvertently contributing to the exodus that is the issue. The Giteau Law encourages players to leave Australia because they can make big bucks overseas and be comforted by the knowledge they can still play in the World Cup if they are required. There is almost a first XV of Test players departing Australia \u2013 Rory Arnold, Adam Coleman, Quade Cooper, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, Sekope Kepu, Samu Kerevi, Christian Lealiifano, Nick Phipps, David Pocock and Curtis Rona \u2013 which will have a negative impact on the standard of the nation\u2019s domestic teams. In some cases players will still be eligible to play for the Wallabies, but Coleman (29 Tests) and Kerevi (23 Tests) will be ineligible, and they are in the prime of their careers. That is a big concern. Coleman, 27, and Kerevi, 25, are young enough to play in the 2023 World Cup in France. This means they could play overseas for the next four years and sign to play with a Super Rugby team after 2023 to become eligible. Good for the Wallabies, not so good for Super Rugby. You could argue that in a World Cup year the only thing that matters is the winning the Webb Ellis Cup. Forget about Super Rugby. But that\u2019s the problem, too many people are forgetting about it. Former Wallabies centre Tim Horan has called for RA to abolish restrictions on overseas-based players altogether in World Cup years, but if that were to happen the bottom would fall out of Super Rugby. It may do anyway. In effect, the current eligibility rules are close to open slather. With the exception of Skelton, and possibly Japan-based back-rower Sean McMahon, Cheika has got all of the overseas players he wanted. It is a clear signal to players that they no longer need play in Super Rugby to be eligible for the Wallabies at the World Cup and will encourage more to go offshore, further weakening an already fragile Super Rugby scene. Sure, the domestic competition would benefit by players committing to Australian rugby for two years after the World Cup, but in many cases those players will be past their prime, coming home to collect a superannuation contract. Of course, the Wallabies are the most important team in Australian rugby and the World Cup is the ultimate objective. Success at the World Cup would have a positive effect on Super Rugby, but do we really need to destroy the village in order to save it? There is no doubt the Wallabies squad is stronger with O\u2019Connor, White and Toomua in it and may have been even more so with Skelton as well, but is it really that much stronger?

Duncan Lewis, director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, has also warned individuals sharing the officer\u2019s name on social media that they are probably committing a criminal offence. Lewis issued the statement a day after Guardian Australia revealed that Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s office had inadvertently published the name of an Asio officer during the routine online release of the premier\u2019s diaries. Publishing the names of Asio operatives is a crime potentially punishable by 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. \u201cThe protection of Asio officers\u2019 identities is a matter of great importance to the security of our operations and of course to the individual concerned,\u201d Lewis said on Friday. \u201cThe recent online publication of an Asio officer\u2019s name in the Queensland premier\u2019s diary documentation was an inadvertent and regrettable administrative error. \u201cOn behalf of Asio, I acknowledge and accept the apology from the Queensland government.\u201d Asio said it was working with the Queensland government to address the disclosure.

The diary was quickly removed and the premier\u2019s office apologised for what it said was an \u201cadministrative error\u201d. On Friday, the LNP opposition said it would refer the matter to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP).

Ryan\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment. It is not an offence to name the Asio director-general. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, told News Corp on Thursday night that the mistake appeared accidental, but was indicative of the \u201cchaos\u201d in the premier\u2019s office. \u201cThe wheels are falling off the Palaszczuk government, and this is just the latest disaster, but I fear not the last,\u201d Dutton said. The laws are designed to prevent intelligence officers from being targeted by foreign intelligence services or other actors. The intelligence community says that even the most innocuous personal details about operatives can undermine national security and give advantage to foreign powers. John Blaxland, an intelligence and security expert at the Australian National University, said the secrecy provisions were introduced after Asio officers were targeted by a vigilante group in the 1970s. \u201cSince then, the threat to Asio officers has grown and the need for secrecy of identity has, if anything, become all the more important,\u201d Blaxland said. \u201cAfter all, we expect Asio officers to help keep us safe by engaging with the types of characters for whom life is, at times, cheap.

      "bodyText": "Basketball fans in Melbourne were left fuming after paying hundreds of dollars for seats that offered shockingly poor views of Australia\u2019s clash with the US at Marvel Stadium on Thursday night. Many disgruntled fans among the 51,000-strong crowd at the Docklands arena have complained to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The game was played on a temporary court with a raised floor in the middle of the AFL-owned stadium that usually stages football matches. Fans seated on plastic chairs courtside were unimpressed, venting their rage on social media after paying hundreds of dollars for the seats. Some compared the event to the Bahamas\u2019 fraudulent luxury music festival Fyre. The Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe was scathing after paying $1,500 for his ticket. \u201cJoke\u2019s on me,\u201d he tweeted. The ACCC has confirmed it has received a couple of hundred complaints concerning misleading advertising of super star players and is expecting more about seating. Its chairman, Rod Sims, said his team has been investigating the matter for more than a week and event promoter Teg [Live] had issued some refunds. \u201cWe\u2019re now going to extend the investigation to see if people were misled about the seating,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe need to look at what people were told, when they were told it in relation to the players, how long those ads were running, how many people bought tickets while those ads were running \u2026 what were they told in relation to the seating.\u201d Sims could not say how long an investigation could take but said collecting evidence for potential court action could take several months. Teg [Live] could face hefty fines if it is convicted of breaching Australian consumer law. Last year federal parliament passed laws which lifted penalties from $1.1m to $10m, or three times the profit made or 10% of turnover. Comment has been sought from the Teg [Live], Basketball Australia and Marvel stadium. A basketball fan who paid $500 for a ticket said he wanted his money back and described the marketing as a \u201crort\u201d. \u201cWhen everyone was seated you could only see the players\u2019 heads,\u201d another fan posted on Twitter. Australia have not beaten the US in 55 years and that record rarely looked likely to change on Thursday as they fell 102-86 in the first of two matches against the US, despite the visitors missing a host of NBA stars. LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry were all missing and other big names, such as Anthony Davis and James Harden, were featured in advertising but did not play. Australia\u2019s biggest star, Ben Simmons, also pulled out after he signed a multimillion-dollar deal to stay with his NBA team, the Philadelphia 76ers. The evening was a disgrace, one spectator, Lee Turner, said. \u201cNot only did the stars all pull out, not only did TEG not reply to emails asking for a refund or answer the phone, the seats were pitiful and you couldn\u2019t even see the court.

Peters has become one of the viral stars of TikTok, an app that is only just expanding into the mainstream after years as an open secret among pop music-obsessed teenagers.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s downsides to social media,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can connect us to people really far away, and disconnect us to people really close. But never before have humans been able to amplify very simple messages. And TikTok is the simplest message of all. It has to be really, really boiled down.\u201d</p> <p>It helps too that Peters is genuinely funny, something that might surprise those who picture the church as lumbering and anachronistic. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of comedy in church,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was in the marines years ago, some of the greatest moments of comedy came in the greatest moments of seriousness. Church is like that. Humour is a way of reminding us that not everything stays the same. There is a shadow in the valley of death, but there\u2019s also moments where we\u2019re by the springs of living water.\u201d</p> <p>That humour is light and gentle, but oddly affecting. Take Peters\u2019 version of the bottle cap challenge. A meme that saw users film themselves kicking a cap off a soft drink bottle in increasingly outlandish ways, Peters\u2019 contribution involved glancing a thurible against the top of a bottle of port.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Priest tiktok\">  <iframe width=\"340\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6717917409379945733\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>On paper, his success might seem bizarre. After all, TikTok\u2019s audience is a youthful one, and your average teenager harbours a suspicion of middle-aged people that borders on the pathological. Certainly Peters does receive a degree of pushback, most of it in the form of crude jokes. But he credits the largely welcoming and supportive audience he has found on the app to his missionary experience.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an office,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going out to where people are \u2026 I try to do it speaking their language and being a listener. The videos I\u2019ve made for TikTok, I\u2019ve tried to use the language of the medium. Which is like going to any new culture. If you show respect and listen, you\u2019ll learn a few things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Priest on TikTok\">  <iframe width=\"340\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6718492518536711430\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>As with Vine, the now defunct video-sharing app, the key to popularity on TikTok is sincerity. Its trends are mundane for a reason: users are encouraged to film themselves how they really are, whether that be lip-syncing to pop in their room or messing around with soft drink bottles. The only crime you can commit on the app is being fake. As a result, although the content across TikTok is diverse \u2013 some of it is deeply bizarre, some is hilarious, some is vaguely horrifying \u2013 there\u2019s a zero tolerance policy in the way of artifice. Teens can sense a narc in their midst from a mile away.</p> <p>Perhaps this goes some ways to explaining Peters\u2019 success. Although most of Gen-Z would cross the road to avoid a friendly middle-aged person eager to talk to them about faith, they understand Peters is not trying to dupe them. </p> <p>\u201cAs churches, we lead with our vulnerability,\u201d Peters says. \u201cWe share our stories and our experiences and encourage others to as well.<strong> </strong>The symbol of our faith is a cross, which often has a figure of a man dying on it.\u201d He laughs a little. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t vulnerability, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

In another, he gently pokes fun at the people who\u2019ve suggested he just write a bestseller, rather than his dense but illuminating treatises on God and PTSD. The videos were designed to draw young Austinites to the church, but their popularity has been much wider. Peters has become one of the viral stars of TikTok, an app that is only just expanding into the mainstream after years as an open secret among pop music-obsessed teenagers. \u201cThere\u2019s downsides to social media,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can connect us to people really far away, and disconnect us to people really close. But never before have humans been able to amplify very simple messages. And TikTok is the simplest message of all. It has to be really, really boiled down.\u201d It helps too that Peters is genuinely funny, something that might surprise those who picture the church as lumbering and anachronistic. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of comedy in church,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was in the marines years ago, some of the greatest moments of comedy came in the greatest moments of seriousness. Church is like that. Humour is a way of reminding us that not everything stays the same. There is a shadow in the valley of death, but there\u2019s also moments where we\u2019re by the springs of living water.\u201d That humour is light and gentle, but oddly affecting. Take Peters\u2019 version of the bottle cap challenge. A meme that saw users film themselves kicking a cap off a soft drink bottle in increasingly outlandish ways, Peters\u2019 contribution involved glancing a thurible against the top of a bottle of port. On paper, his success might seem bizarre. After all, TikTok\u2019s audience is a youthful one, and your average teenager harbours a suspicion of middle-aged people that borders on the pathological. Certainly Peters does receive a degree of pushback, most of it in the form of crude jokes. But he credits the largely welcoming and supportive audience he has found on the app to his missionary experience. \u201cI don\u2019t have an office,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going out to where people are \u2026 I try to do it speaking their language and being a listener. The videos I\u2019ve made for TikTok, I\u2019ve tried to use the language of the medium. Which is like going to any new culture. If you show respect and listen, you\u2019ll learn a few things.\u201d As with Vine, the now defunct video-sharing app, the key to popularity on TikTok is sincerity. Its trends are mundane for a reason: users are encouraged to film themselves how they really are, whether that be lip-syncing to pop in their room or messing around with soft drink bottles. The only crime you can commit on the app is being fake. As a result, although the content across TikTok is diverse \u2013 some of it is deeply bizarre, some is hilarious, some is vaguely horrifying \u2013 there\u2019s a zero tolerance policy in the way of artifice. Teens can sense a narc in their midst from a mile away. Perhaps this goes some ways to explaining Peters\u2019 success. Although most of Gen-Z would cross the road to avoid a friendly middle-aged person eager to talk to them about faith, they understand Peters is not trying to dupe them. \u201cAs churches, we lead with our vulnerability,\u201d Peters says. \u201cWe share our stories and our experiences and encourage others to as well. The symbol of our faith is a cross, which often has a figure of a man dying on it.\u201d He laughs a little. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t vulnerability, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d",

The blogpost also uses the word \u201ckritarch\u201d to refer to judges, a reference to a system of governance involving rule by judges in ancient Israeli history and an apparent invocation of antisemitism. \u201cVDare\u2019s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control,\u201d Ashley Tabaddor, the union president, wrote in a letter to the EOIR about the incident, according to BuzzFeed News. \u201cPublication and dissemination of a white supremacist, anti-semitic website throughout the EOIR is antithetical to the goals and ideals of the Department of Justice.\u201d \u201cThe daily EOIR morning news briefings are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included,\u201d said Kathryn Mattingly, an assistant press secretary for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cThe Department of Justice condemns antisemitism in the strongest terms.\u201d Mattingly did not immediately respond to questions about the contractor, whether the DOJ will launch an investigation or whether anyone will be disciplined. VDare was founded by Peter Brimelow, a British immigrant to the US, and is named after Virginia Dare, who is supposed to be the first English child born in the Americas. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes it as an \u201can anti-immigration hate website\u201d. The newsletter was sent in a week in which Donald Trump twice accused Jewish Americans of \u201cdisloyalty\u201d if they vote for Democrats. \u201cI think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty,\u201d he said on Tuesday. Despite immediate criticism of the blatant antisemitism of the statement, which both invoked the bigoted trope of \u201cdual loyalty\u201d and assumed that Jewish Americans do and should vote solely based on US policy toward Israel, Trump repeated the comments on Wednesday. \u201cIf you vote for a Democrat, you\u2019re being disloyal to Jewish people and you\u2019re being very disloyal to Israel,\u201d he said. According to the Pew Research Center, 79% of Jewish voters supported Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm election. According to 2018 Election Day polling by J Street, a progressive Jewish American lobbying group, the top two voting issues for Jews in 2018 were healthcare and gun violence. Just 4% of American Jewish voters selected Israel as one of their top two voting issues. Update: On 23 August, the justice department announced that it will cease distributing the daily email and will not renew its contract with the company that provided it, TechMIS, according to the Washington Post. \u201cWe have determined that the sampling was over inclusive and contained non-news sources,\u201d Mattingly said of the newsletters in a statement to the Post. \u201cEOIR will no longer be distributing a daily news briefing to its staff. EOIR strongly condemns anti-Semitism and white nationalism. Those hateful beliefs do not reflect the views of EOIR employees and the Department of Justice.\u201d",

From Friday, about 100 solar panels at the trackside site will supply renewable electricity to power the signalling and lights on Network Rail\u2019s Wessex route. The 30kW pilot scheme could pave the way for a larger project capable of directly powering the trains that use this route from next year. The solar breakthrough comes as Network Rail plans to spend billions of pounds electrifying rail lines to avoid running trains on diesel. This could help reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and costs. Solar panels are already used to power the operations of train stations, including Blackfriars in central London. But the Aldershot project is the first time a solar array will bypass the electricity grid to plug directly into a railway\u2019s \u201ctraction\u201d system. Network Rail hopes to use the scheme, developed by the charity 10:10 Climate Action and Imperial College London, to solar-charge its rail lines across the country. Stuart Kistruck, a director for Network Rail\u2019s Wessex route, said: \u201cWe have ambitions to roll this technology out further across the network should this demonstrator project prove successful, so we can deliver a greener, better railway for our passengers and the wider public.\u201d The research team behind the project, called Riding Sunbeams, estimates that solar could power 20% of the Merseyrail network in Liverpool, as well as 15% of commuter routes in Kent, Sussex and Wessex. There is also scope for solar trams in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Nottingham, London and Manchester, according to the team. The researchers began work on the plans over two years ago to discover whether bypassing the electricity grid could make solar power a more efficient energy source for trains. Innovate UK awarded the project funding from the Department of Transport after it proved that connecting solar power directly to rail, tube and tram networks could help meet a significant share of their electricity needs. The falling cost of solar power technologies means these subsidy-free solar farms could supply electricity at a lower cost than the electricity supplied via the grid. The findings come as plans to electrify Britain\u2019s rail lines have faltered in recent years owing to concern about costs. Leo Murray, the director of Riding Sunbeams, said future projects across the UK could be community-owned, and pay back benefits to local community funds. By the end of 2020, Riding Sunbeams hopes to build and connect the world\u2019s first-ever full-scale community- and commuter-owned solar farm to UK railways.

HSBC condemned \u201cviolence of any kind\u201d and called for talks to resolve the dispute.</p> \n<p>They have good reason to be worried. The city, which enjoys special economic status out of Beijing\u2019s reach, was already showing the strains of the slowdown in China and the country\u2019s growing trade war with the US.

But the last few weeks, starting in July, things went absolutely crazy. I think a lot of foreigners, when they watch the news, they see a lot of clashes between police and protesters and \u2026 are just kind of put off by coming [to Hong Kong].\u201d</p> \n<p>She says it is difficult to plan because of the spontaneity of protests. \u201cThat really affected my business because as a guide I can\u2019t really tell my guests whether it\u2019s safe or not.\u201d</p> \n<p>The consultancy Capital Economics predicts a recession in the next quarter as visible signs of weakness emerge from the fog of protest.</p> \n<p>\u201cRetail sales are particularly badly affected and mainland tourism has fallen,\u201d says Capital\u2019s Julian Evans-Pritchard. \u201cFour per cent of Hong Kong\u2019s GDP is from tourism and 75% of tourists are from the mainland and they\u2019ve stopped going because of the way the protests are portrayed there. We see this continuing deep into [the third quarter] with a technical recession \u2013 the first since the global financial crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>The economy could bounce back, of course. But the wider question is whether corporations around the world, seeing the way that the Cathay Pacific boss, Rupert Hogg, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.pe.ca/business/reuters/cathay-pacific-shares-rise-23-percent-after-ceo-hogg-resigns-342596/\">summarily forced out of his job</a> after some of his staff came out in favour of the protesters, may find reasons to take their business and their headquarters to cities such as Singapore.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The bigger concern is more to do with Hong Kong\u2019s image as a stable business environment\"</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Julian Evans-Pritchard</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe bigger concern is more to do with Hong Kong\u2019s image as a stable business environment,\u201d says Evans-Pritchard. \u201cI think this perception has been permanently damaged by the protests. The 2014 umbrella movement was shrugged off. But this time it increasingly feels like a broader form of protest.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gary Ng, an Asia Pacific economist at Natixis, agrees that the ousting of Hogg as head of the Hong Kong-based airline, apparently after pressure from Beijing, sent a clear signal to businesses.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom an economic perspective, multinationals could re-evaluate Hong Kong\u2019s role as a regional business headquarters if domestic political and geopolitical risks continue to rise, which could include pressure from all stakeholders,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Kyle Bass, founder of the American hedge fund Hayman Capital Management, goes further: he believes US companies will cease capital investment in Hong Kong and that wealthy local families will stop buying property there.</p> \n<p>Predicting massive capital flight, he also says they would be \u201cfools\u201d not to change their Hong Kong dollars into greenbacks while the two currencies are still pegged.</p> \n<p>But he thinks the clouds over Hong Kong\u2019s economy are darker still. It is not just the denizens of global boardrooms and the city\u2019s elite that fear a loss of order. The much more powerful elite sitting in Beijing, which sees the protests as a direct challenge to its authority, is also rethinking its relations with its increasingly troublesome special administrative region. The Chinese troops massed across the border in Shenzhen suggest a day of reckoning awaits.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe pattern is set,\u201d says Bass, whose fund has a focus on world events. \u201cBeijing can\u2019t afford to back down and the forces massed in Shenzhen will come in. When that happens all bets are off. If you had family in Hong Kong you would be trying to get them out.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you look at geopolitics through history, when people lose faith in their leadership, when they lose faith in their police, there is no getting this back. The bottom line is that the leadership in Hong Kong has abandoned their constituency in favour of Beijing.\u201d</p>",

HSBC condemned \u201cviolence of any kind\u201d and called for talks to resolve the dispute. They have good reason to be worried. The city, which enjoys special economic status out of Beijing\u2019s reach, was already showing the strains of the slowdown in China and the country\u2019s growing trade war with the US. The three months to June were the weakest since 2009. Retail sales fell 6.7% in June and tourist numbers crashed by 13% in the same month. The city\u2019s spectacularly expensive property market, where average values are 21 times higher than the median income, has also been creaking. But the regular displays of defiance by hundreds of thousands of citizens against the widely despised city government and the knock-on impact of strikes in the aviation, transportation and healthcare sectors appear certain to push growth down further in the coming months. In Hong Kong\u2019s Wan Chai district, which has been at the centre of mass marches since June, small businesses say they have seen a drop of 30% to 40% in sales on protest weekends. Ashley Yue, whose Hong Kong Food Crawlers business takes tourists on food tours of the city, says there has been a 50% drop in private bookings since July. \u201cThere is definitely concern,\u201d she says. \u201cWithin the first month of the protest people weren\u2019t so concerned. But the last few weeks, starting in July, things went absolutely crazy. I think a lot of foreigners, when they watch the news, they see a lot of clashes between police and protesters and \u2026 are just kind of put off by coming [to Hong Kong].\u201d She says it is difficult to plan because of the spontaneity of protests. \u201cThat really affected my business because as a guide I can\u2019t really tell my guests whether it\u2019s safe or not.\u201d The consultancy Capital Economics predicts a recession in the next quarter as visible signs of weakness emerge from the fog of protest. \u201cRetail sales are particularly badly affected and mainland tourism has fallen,\u201d says Capital\u2019s Julian Evans-Pritchard. \u201cFour per cent of Hong Kong\u2019s GDP is from tourism and 75% of tourists are from the mainland and they\u2019ve stopped going because of the way the protests are portrayed there. We see this continuing deep into [the third quarter] with a technical recession \u2013 the first since the global financial crisis.\u201d The economy could bounce back, of course. But the wider question is whether corporations around the world, seeing the way that the Cathay Pacific boss, Rupert Hogg, was summarily forced out of his job after some of his staff came out in favour of the protesters, may find reasons to take their business and their headquarters to cities such as Singapore. \u201cThe bigger concern is more to do with Hong Kong\u2019s image as a stable business environment,\u201d says Evans-Pritchard. \u201cI think this perception has been permanently damaged by the protests. The 2014 umbrella movement was shrugged off. But this time it increasingly feels like a broader form of protest.\u201d Gary Ng, an Asia Pacific economist at Natixis, agrees that the ousting of Hogg as head of the Hong Kong-based airline, apparently after pressure from Beijing, sent a clear signal to businesses. \u201cFrom an economic perspective, multinationals could re-evaluate Hong Kong\u2019s role as a regional business headquarters if domestic political and geopolitical risks continue to rise, which could include pressure from all stakeholders,\u201d he says. Kyle Bass, founder of the American hedge fund Hayman Capital Management, goes further: he believes US companies will cease capital investment in Hong Kong and that wealthy local families will stop buying property there. Predicting massive capital flight, he also says they would be \u201cfools\u201d not to change their Hong Kong dollars into greenbacks while the two currencies are still pegged. But he thinks the clouds over Hong Kong\u2019s economy are darker still. It is not just the denizens of global boardrooms and the city\u2019s elite that fear a loss of order. The much more powerful elite sitting in Beijing, which sees the protests as a direct challenge to its authority, is also rethinking its relations with its increasingly troublesome special administrative region. The Chinese troops massed across the border in Shenzhen suggest a day of reckoning awaits. \u201cThe pattern is set,\u201d says Bass, whose fund has a focus on world events. \u201cBeijing can\u2019t afford to back down and the forces massed in Shenzhen will come in. When that happens all bets are off. If you had family in Hong Kong you would be trying to get them out. \u201cIf you look at geopolitics through history, when people lose faith in their leadership, when they lose faith in their police, there is no getting this back. The bottom line is that the leadership in Hong Kong has abandoned their constituency in favour of Beijing.\u201d",

The post refers to the New York Times as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/24/the-ugly-history-of-luegenpresse-a-nazi-slur-shouted-at-a-trump-rally/\">lugenpresse</a>\u201d, a German term meaning \u201clying press\u201d that was adopted by the Nazis to stigmatize Jews, communists, and critics of <strong>Adolf Hitler</strong>. In recent years the slur has regained popularity within the far right and white nationalists. The blog post also uses the word \u201ckritarch\u201d to refer to judges, a reference to a system of governance involving rule by judges in ancient Israeli history and an apparent invocation of anti-semitism.</p> <p>\u201cVDare\u2019s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control,\u201d Ashley Tabaddor, the union president, wrote in a letter to the EOIR about the incident, according to BuzzFeed News. \u201cPublication and dissemination of a white supremacist, anti-semitic website throughout the EOIR is antithetical to the goals and ideals of the Department of Justice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe daily EOIR morning news briefings are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included,\u201d a spokesman for the justice department told BuzzFeed News. </p> <p>VDare is a virulently anti-immigrant website that promotes white nationalism, white supremacy and anti-Semitism.

Former Republican congressman Joe Walsh said he is considering a primary challenge against Trump. Former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee said he might run as a Libertarian. The department of justice distributed a link to an antisemitic blog post on VDare, a white nationalist website, in an email sent to immigration court employees. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke endorsed the proposal by youth gun violence prevention activists March for our Lives to reexamine the supreme court\u2019s current interpretation of the second amendment. The day before the deadly attack against Latinos in El Paso, Texas governor Greg Abbott sent out an anti-immigrant fundraising letter calling on Republicans to \u201cDEFEND TEXAS NOW\u201d and \u201ctake matters into our own hands\u201d. Customs and Border Patrol agents are searching for a 3-year-old boy who is believed missing after attempting to cross the Rio Grande near the Eagle Pass border crossing in Texas. The child and his mother are believed to be part of a group of 12 migrants who were seen attempting to cross the river at 1:30am on 20 August. Members of the group reported that the pair were swept away by the current, CBP said. The body of a 28-year-old Honduran woman, believed to be the toddler\u2019s mother, was recovered yesterday. \u201cThis is heartbreaking tragedy that occurs too often,\u201d said Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L Ortiz in a statement. \u201cBorder Patrol agents are using all available resources in the search for the missing boy.\u201d The Eagle Pass border crossing is just a few miles from the site of the drowning of a father and his 23-old-month daughter in June. Their lifeless bodies, floating amid reeds, were captured in a devastating photograph that was published widely by media outlets hoping to draw attention to the unnecessary peril created by US policy on the southern border. Migrants have the right to request asylum under US law and international treaties. However, the Trump administration has drastically reduced the number of people it will allow to apply for asylum at border crossings, creating a massive backlog that has forced many migrants to remain in Mexico for month \u2013 or risk a treacherous river crossing. Former Congressman and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke told the Guardian on Thursday he supports a proposal by the March for our Lives, a group of youth gun violence prevention activists, to reexamine the supreme court\u2019s current interpretation of the second amendment right to bear arms. O\u2019Rourke was the first Democratic 2020 candidate to support March for Our Lives\u2019 ambitious new policy agenda for gun control reform. His campaign did not back away from the most controversial elements of the youth activists\u2019 plan, including their desire to revisit the supreme court\u2019s current interpretation of the second amendment, enshrined in the 2009 District of Columbia v Heller decision, which found that Americans have an individual right to own handguns in their homes for self defense. \u201cWhile Beto agrees with the court\u2019s holding that the second amendment allows for regulation, he does not agree with the entirety of the Heller decision,\u201d National Press Secretary Aleigha Cavalier said in a statement. \u201cOne piece of the Heller case Beto believes should be revisited is the court\u2019s decision to strike down DC\u2019s safe storage requirements.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s made similar arguments about \u201csafe storage requirements\u201d and the Heller decision during her 2016 presidential campaign. Asked explicitly if O\u2019Rourke \u201cbelieves the second amendment should be interpreted to guarantee Americans the right to own handguns in their home for self defense, or not,\u201d the campaign dodged giving any clear answer. \u201cBeto believes the second amendment allows for the reasonable regulation of firearms, and as president, will appoint judges that uphold that belief.\u201d Kathryn Mattingly, assistant press secretary for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, just provided the Guardian with the following statement in response to BuzzFeed News\u2019s startling report that the government agency distributed a link to a white nationalist website: \u201cThe daily EOIR morning news briefings are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included. The Department of Justice condemns Anti-Semitism in the strongest terms.\u201d Hello all, this is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco, picking up the live blog for the rest of the day. BuzzFeed News just published an astonishing report about the distribution of a link to a white nationalist website by the US Department of Justice. According to the report, the Executive Office for Immigration Review included a link to a blog post on the white nationalist website VDare in a morning news briefing that was emailed to immigration court employees earlier this week. The blog post is about an effort to dissolve the National Association of Immigration Judges, a union representing employees of the immigration courts. The post refers to the New York Times as \u201clugenpresse\u201d, a German term meaning \u201clying press\u201d that was adopted by the Nazis to stigmatize Jews, communists, and critics of Adolf Hitler. In recent years the slur has regained popularity within the far right and white nationalists. The blog post also uses the word \u201ckritarch\u201d to refer to judges, a reference to a system of governance involving rule by judges in ancient Israeli history and an apparent invocation of anti-semitism. \u201cVDare\u2019s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control,\u201d Ashley Tabaddor, the union president, wrote in a letter to the EOIR about the incident, according to BuzzFeed News. \u201cPublication and dissemination of a white supremacist, anti-semitic website throughout the EOIR is antithetical to the goals and ideals of the Department of Justice.\u201d \u201cThe daily EOIR morning news briefings are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included,\u201d a spokesman for the justice department told BuzzFeed News. VDare is a virulently anti-immigrant website that promotes white nationalism, white supremacy and anti-Semitism. It was founded by Peter Brimelow, a British immigrant to the US, and is named after Virginia Dare, who is supposed to be the first English child born in the Americas. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes it as an \u201can anti-immigration hate website\u201d. The justice department did not immediately respond to additional queries from the Guardian. I\u2019m signing off for the day and handing over the reigns to my talented colleague, Julia Wong. Thanks for sticking with us through what has proved to be a slow but steady news days. Here\u2019s a roundup of the biggest news of the day. One-term Republican congressman and radio show host Joe Walsh said he is \u201cstrongly\u201d considering a primary run against Trump. Meanwhile, former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee says he might run as a Libertarian. Jay Inslee ended his presidential bid and announced he would seek a third term as governor of Washington state. John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor who ended his campaign earlier this month, announced he would run for Senate. Former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders today became the latest senior Trump official to join Fox News. Her first appearance will be on Fox &amp; Friends on 6 September. The DNC rejected a proposal to host a presidential primary debate centered on climate change, disappointing activists and progressive who had pushed for one. US senator Chris Murphy has revived hopes of action on background check legislation in Congress. After speaking to the White House, he tweeted that the White House has \u201cnot walked away\u201d despite Trump\u2019s near-daily shifts on the issue. Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat who became a leading champion of gun control in the wake of the Newtown shooting, has revived hope of action on background checks after Trump appeared to walk back his support. Trump has shifted his opinion on expanding background checks on all firearms purchases, initially throwing his support behind such reforms after back-to-back mass shootings left 31 people dead in Texas and Ohio earlier this month. But this week, after reportedly being lobbied by the NRA and conservative lawmakers, Trump waffled. According to Murphy, the door is still open for action on background checks, which maintains broad support from the American public, including Republicans. We\u2019re standing by for Donald Trump to present the Medal of Freedom to Bob Cousy. Earlier on Thursday, Bernie Sanders visited Paradise, the California town devastated by a wildfire that left 86 people dead. The tour came after Sanders unveiled one of the most sweeping climate plans. After Trump reportedly joked about trading Greenland for Puerto Rico \u2013 residents of the US territory considered the deal. Mostly in jest, some Puerto Ricans called themselves \u201cCaribbean Vikings\u201d and posted memes about the swap. NBC News rounded up a few of the best reactions here. The Democratic National Committee has voted to reject a resolution to host a primary debate singularly focused on climate change, despite mounting calls for one from activists and candidates as the risks posed by global warming become a top priority for voters. At a party conference in San Francisco on Thursday, top DNC officials voted 17 to 8 against a resolution that would have dedicated one of the 12 Democratic debates entirely to the issue. \u201cClimate is such an intersectional issue. It allows us to talk about jobs, economics, racial disparities, healthcare, national security,\u201d said Tina Podlodowski, the chair of the Washington State Democrats and the author of the resolution calling for a climate debate. \u201cAnd then of course there\u2019s that little issue of the very survival of our species.\u201d Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to presidential candidate Joe Biden, argued against the measure, saying that the DNC would be falling into \u201cdangerous territory\u201d if it changed party rules to allow for the climate debate. Others cited concerns about opening the door for a flood of single-issue events. Mose candidates, including Biden, have said they are open to a debate centered on combatting climate change. The presidential candidate who fought hardest for the debate, Jay Inslee, suspended his campaign on Wednesday to run for governor. CNN will host a climate town hall before the third presidential debate next month, and MSNBC has partnered with a handful of organizations to host a multi-day forum with candidates on the subject. After the resolution failed to pass, activists with the youth-led Sunrise Movement disrupted the meeting and began to sing Which Side Are You On. Read more from the Guardian\u2019s Susie Cagle in San Francisco. Mark Hamill, best known for playing Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars trilogy, is no fan of the president. But Trump\u2019s claim that he is the \u201cchosen one\u201d as he defended a trade war with China was enough to shock a the best-trained Jedi in the galaxy. Overstock CEO Partick Byrne resigned from the online retailer on Thursday after his controversial comments about on his involvement with the \u201cdeep state\u201d following the disclosure of an affair with a woman accused of being a Russian agent. The company\u2019s shares, which had fallen in the wake of Byrne\u2019s comments, rose sharply amid news of his departure. In July I came forward to a small set of journalists regarding my involvement in certain government matters. Doing so was not my first choice, but I was reminded of the damage done to our nation for three years and felt my duty as a citizen precluded me from staying silent any longer. Though patriotic Americans are writing me in support, my presence may affect and complicate all manner of business relationships, from insurability to strategic discussions regarding our retail business. Thus, while I believe that I did what was necessary for the good of the country, for the good of the firm, I am in the sad position of having to sever ties with Overstock, both as CEO and board member, effective Thursday August 22,\u201d Byrne, who founded the company 20 years ago, wrote in a letter to shareholders. His tenure was thrown into uncertainty after he revealed that he had been romantically involved with Maria Butina, a Russian operative currently serving an 18-month prison sentence for trying to infiltrate American politics through her connections with the National Rifle Association. He disclosed their relationship in a press release titled \u201cOverstock.com CEO Comments on Deep State, Withholds Further Comment\u201d in which referred to federal agents as \u201cMen in Black\u201d and said he assisted in the \u201cClinton investigation\u201d and the \u201cRussia investigation\u201d. The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led organization behind the Green New Deal, has endorsed Massachusetts senator Ed Markey amid rumors that congressman Joe Kennedy III is considering mounting a primary bid for the seat. Earlier this year, Markey, 73, shored up his progressive credentials by linking arms with New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to introduce a Green New Deal in the Senate. At 38, Kennedy, grandson of Robert Kennedy, is the youngest member of the family\u2019s political dynasty. A primary between Markey and Kennedy could serve as a test for Democrats at a time when a new generation of young progressives are challenging the party\u2019s Old Guard. In this context, the endorsement from the Sunrise Movement sends a signal to voters that the senator can appeal to the party\u2019s activist base and that he is committed to the issues energizing the grassroots. The sprawling Democratic field has winnowed slightly with the departures of Inslee and Hickenlooper. But there are still 22 Democrats running \u2013 and less than half have met the fundraising and polling threshhold to qualify for the third debate in Houston next month. The urgent question now is who will be the next to go? Ten candidate will appear on stage in Houston, including Juli\u00e1n Castro who just qualified this week thanks to a new CNN poll showing him at 2% nationally. The other top tier candidates to make the cut \u2013 and are therefore less likely to drop out anytime soon \u2013 are: former vice president Joe Biden, senator Bernie Sanders, senator Elizabeth Warren, senator Kamala Harris, senator Cory Booker, mayor Pete Buttigieg, senator Amy Klobuchar, former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. To qualify, the Democratic candidates must receive at least 130,000 contributions from individual donors and earned 2% support in at least four acceptable polls. Billionaire Tom Steyer, the field\u2019s most recent entrant, is one poll away from making the debate stage while Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard needs two more polls. New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand is just shy of the contributions threshold and still needs three more polls and self-help guru Marianne Williamson has enough contributors but needs to raise her polling numbers. The cutoff date for the Houston debate \u2013 and a separate CNN town hall on climate change ahead of the debate \u2013 is 28 August. For candidates who have failed to break through and are struggling to raise money that might just be the end of the road. The possibilities include Gabbard, congressmen Seth Moulton and Tim Ryan, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet, New York mayor Bill de Blasio, Montana governor Steve Bullock. Former congressman John Delaney, who is self-funding his campaign, has not seen his numbers move, even after being given a relatively long time to make his case for a moderate healthcare plan during the last debate. Meanwhile, Williamson has had several break out moments on the debate stage to become an instant online meme, but it hasn\u2019t translated into hard support. There are also other considerations to take into account. Of the candidates who have dropped out, congressman Eric Swalwell, Hickenlooper and Inslee, all dropped out to turn their attention to home state races for House, Senate and the Governor\u2019s mansion, respectively. Would Bullock leave to run for senate in Montana as he\u2019s been encouraged to? Likewise, O\u2019Rourke is being urged to abandon his presidential ambitions and run for Senate in Texas. Let\u2019s cross the border for a second to talk about Canadian politics. Prime minister Justin Trudeau: young and charismatic with a tuft of brown hair envied by leaders the world over was celebrated as liberals best hope of regaining power in Canada when he ran for election in 2015. But after four years in power, \u201ccracks in his image have started to show,\u201d writes Ashifa Kassam. Some of the policies enacted by Trudeau\u2019s government have made his political identity seem hollow, even disingenuous. Compounding this has been the ongoing fallout from the most significant controversy of his tenure: Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog recently found that Trudeau broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law in the hopes of allowing a giant engineering and construction firm to avoid a corruption trial. The company is facing charges in connection with millions of dollars in bribes allegedly paid to officials in Libya, including members of the Gaddafi regime, between 2001 and 2011. Don\u2019t miss this commentary from Barbra Streisand, a former lover of [Trudeau\u2019s father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau], who once described him as a blend of \u201cMarlon Brando and Napoleon\u201d. In contrast, one critic had memorably dubbed Justin \u201cthe Paris Hilton of Canadian politics\u201d. Trump\u2019s offer to buy Greenland was mostly met with by the international community with derision and laughter \u2013 except, of course, in Greenland, where residents were perhaps unsurprisingly indignant. But not for the first time, his rhetoric has resonated with right-wing nationalist groups. In this case, it\u2019s the youth wing of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA). According to a report in Politico, the group, which supports a separate Flemish state, has offered to sell the country\u2019s French-speaking region of Wallonia to Trump for a whopping \u20ac1. \u201cDear President, one Euro and Wallonia is yours. Call us,\u201d the youth branch of N-VA wrote on Twitter, tagging Trump, who has yet to reply. The group emphasized that the offer was only a joke and that there was no serious political strategy behind the comment. \u201cWe had absolutely no political message with this and did not want to provoke anything,\u201d the N-VA\u2019s youth president, Lawrence Vancraeyenest, said, according to Politico. \u201cThis was a joke, responding to current events, from a youth perspective.\u201d Jay Inslee announced he will seek a third term as governor of Washington state, a day after ending his 2020 presidential campaign singularly focused on climate change. We have provided the nation a road map for innovation, economic growth, and progressive action. And we\u2019re not done yet,\u201d Inslee wrote in an email to donors. \u201cI want to continue to stand with you in opposing Donald Trump and rejecting his hurtful and divisive agenda, while strengthening and enhancing Washington state\u2019s role as a progressive beacon for the nation. Which is why I\u2019m announcing today my intention to run for a third term as Washington\u2019s governor. Inslee, 68, had struggled to gain traction in a congested primary field. He was unlikely to qualify for the next month\u2019s debate in Houston, Texas, which would have precluded him from participating in a CNN town hall on climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that I\u2019m not going to be carrying the ball,\u201d Inslee said on MSNBC\u2019s The Rachel Maddow Show. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the president, so I\u2019m withdrawing tonight from the race.\u201d Lincoln Chafee, the Republican US Senator turned Independent Rhode Island governor turned Democratic presidential candidate and a longtime proponent of the metric system, might try his luck running for president as a Libertarian in 2020. In an interview with the Daily Beast, Chafee said he was interested in running for president on a third-party ticket. \u201cI\u2019m very motivated as an anti-war American, and also by the deficit,\u201d Chafee, now a Libertarian living in Wyoming, told the news website \u201cThose are two big issues that, if the Libertarian convention next summer thinks that someone with a long record on those issues... if I fit that, then yes, I\u2019d be open to that.\u201d His decision would depend in part on whether Libertarian activists express enthusiasm for his candidacy.T \u201cI\u2019m new to the party and I\u2019m still meeting people through phone calls, email, and in person,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m at this stage learning what they might want.\u201d Read the full story here. And for even more background, I\u2019ve resurrected a write up from Chafee\u2019s 2016 campaign launch, which our reporter said came up a little short \u2013 even on a metric ruler. Trump\u2019s vision of a great Greenland Purchase was perhaps doomed from the start but that hasn\u2019t stopped Republicans from embracing the idea. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the campaign arm of House Republicans is offering donors who contribute more than $25 a limited edition t-shirt that depicts Greenland as a 51st US state. Read more from Politco on the fundraising appeal. Donald Trump has had several press secretaries since taking office in 2017. His first, Sean Spicer that he will be a competitor on the next season of ABC\u2019s Dancing with the Stars. Spicer was followed Anthony Scaramucci, whose latest feud with the president has lasted longer than his employment as White House press secretary. Which brings us to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump\u2019s longest-serving and most loyal press secretary. In perhaps the least surprising post-White House move, Sanders is joining Fox News as a contributor. She will make her debut appearance next month on the president\u2019s favorite show, Fox &amp; Friends. There she joins several former senior White House communications officials, including: Sanders will also join her father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who is a contributor on the network. The outstanding question: will she follow his footsteps and run for governor? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is imploring Democrats not to eliminate the filibuster \u2013 a procedural rule that allows the minority party to stall or block the chamber from voting on legislation or a nominee. \u201cIf future Democrats shortsightedly decide to reduce the Senate to majority rule, we\u2019ll have lost a key safeguard of American government,\u201d the Kentucky Republican writes in an op-ed published in the New York Times. \u201cAnd \u2014 stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one \u2014 they\u2019d regret it a lot sooner than they think.\u201d The op-ed serves as as rejoinder to one written by former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who urged Democrats abolish the filibuster. \u201cThe Senate is now a place where the most pressing issues facing our country are disregarded, along with the will of the American people overwhelmingly calling for action,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThe future of our country is sacrificed at the altar of the filibuster.\u201d Democratic activists have pushed the issue to the forefront of the presidential debate, urging the party\u2019s candidates to commit to eliminating the rule which looms as an obstacle to their ambitious policy proposals. In 2013, Reid deployed the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d and eliminated the filibuster for nominations to executive branch positions and lower-court judgeships in response to Republican obstruction of Barack Obama\u2019s appointees. In 2017, McConnell further limited the minority\u2019s power when he removed the filibuster for Supreme court nominees to undermine a Democratic blockade. The demise of the filibuster is a reflection of the course, partisan nature of this political moment. Obama\u2019s election inspired a conservative uprising against his presidency, with McConnell insisting then that the \u201csingle most important thing\u201d for Congressional Republicans was to ensure that he was a \u201cone-term\u201d president. Eight years later, Trump\u2019s victory has energized grassroots activists and liberals determined to see him removed from office. Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, which is pushing Democrats to adopt such reforms, said the op-ed was a sign McConnell is starting to fear the tactic. The economy is booming. There\u2019s no risk of a recession. Everything is FINE. FINE! Also from the White House: Trump is interested in a payroll tax cut to encourage economic growth in the event of a slowdown. Somewhere in between, Trump continues to insist that the \u201conly problem\u201d with the US economy is the Federal Reserve. For months, Trump has attacked Fed Chairman Jerome Powell \u2013 a man he picked to run the US central bank. Ahead of a speech by Powell in Jackson Hole on Friday, Trump compared the Fed chairman to a golfer who was unable to putt and said he had let the country down. On Thursday, he returned to the subject, though he has so far avoided attacked Powell directly. Bernie Sanders on Thursday proposed the most ambitious plan yet to avert \u201cclimate catastrophe\u201d ahead of a visit to Paradise, the California town destroyed by a wildfire last year. The plan calls for a 10-year, $16.3tn national mobilization and aims to eliminate US carbon emissions by 2050, a target laid out by scientists with the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sanders says the sprawling proposal, which he compares to Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal economic programs, would create millions of jobs and rally the world\u2019s leaders to join forces in the fight against climate change. The plan, he says, would be paid for by \u201cmaking he fossil fuel industry pay for their pollution, through litigation, fees, and taxes, and eliminating federal fossil fuel subsidies.\u201d Sanders\u2019 Green New Deal would also: Aim reach 100% renewable power for both electricity and transportation, the top two contributors to climate change in the US, by 2030 Complete decarbonization by 2050 Expand public ownership of power companies and make electricity \u201cvirtually free\u201d by 2035 A promises to \u201cend unemployment\u201d by creating 20m new jobs Declare climate change a national emergency Invest a $200bn into the Green Climate Fund for countries to slash pollution. Donald Trump\u2019s desire to buy Greenland escalated into an international confrontation this week after he abruptly canceled a trip to Denmark, claiming the country\u2019s prime minister had been \u201cnasty\u201d to him when she called the idea \u201cabsurd\u201d. Now a new backstory is emerging that might explain what piqued the president\u2019s interest in purchasing the icy island. Arkansas senator Tom Cotton said he spoke to the president about buying Greenland months ago and even raised it in a meeting with the Danish ambassador, according to Talk Business &amp; Politics, which hosted an event in Little Rock, where Cotton made his comments. \u201cObviously, the right decision for this country,\u201d Cotton told the group\u2019s CEO when asked about the spat. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, but I can reveal to you that several months ago, I met with the Danish ambassador and I proposed that they sell Greenland to us.\u201d \u201cI told the president you should buy it as well,\u201d Cotton continued, adding later that Trump \u201cheard that from me and from some other people as well.\u201d Cotton, a staunch conservative and a close ally of Trump, said touted such a deal as strategic on the part of the US. Greenland, an autonomous region owned by Denmark, possesses \u201cuntold\u201d economic potential and would be \u201cvital to our national security.\u201d \u201cAnyone who can\u2019t see that is blinded by Trump derangement,\u201d he said. Read a write up of the conversation here. And more on the row between Trump and Denmark. Bet you didn\u2019t see that one coming, did you? Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news. Lauren Gambino here, manning the blog for the day from our nation\u2019s capital. This morning begins with a shakeup to the 2020 race. Overnight, Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington who made climate change the focus of his presidential campaign, has dropped out of the race after failing to qualify for the third primary debate. The Associated Press is reporting Inslee is planning to seek a third term as governor. Joe Walsh, the one-term Illinois congressman and conservative radio show host, says he\u2019s \u201cstrongly, strongly considering\u201d mounting a primary bid against Trump. \u201cThe only way you primary Donald Trump and beat him is to expose him for the con man he is,\u201d Walsh said on CNN\u2019s New Day on Thursday. \u201cAnd if I did it ... that\u2019s what I\u2019d do \u2013 I\u2019d punch him every single day.\u201d Trump already faces a primary challenge, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, but his campaign has yet to generate enough enthusiasm to conceivably test the president\u2019s stranglehold on the Republican party. Meanwhile, John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor who suspended his presidential campaign last month, has announced that he will run for the Senate. Hickenlooper joins a congested primary despite saying things like: \u201cI\u2019m not cut out to be a senator.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always said Washington was a lousy place for a guy like me who wants to get things done \u2013 but this is no time to walk away from the table,\u201d Hickenlooper said in a video announcing his run for Senate to take on Republican incumbent Cory Gardner. What we\u2019re watching for today: Trump has a relatively light public schedule, aside from his daily intelligence briefing. At 4.30 pm, he is scheduled to present the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Celtics legend Bob Cousy, who was known for his public stance against racism and segregation in the 1950s.",

Using current tools, we will still have 11 million cases of malaria in Africa in 2050,\u201d said the review. \u201cIn these circumstances, it is impossible to either set a target date for malaria eradication, formulate a reliable operational plan for malaria eradication or to give it a price tag.\u201d Drug resistance in the malaria parasite has made it harder, but even without that, the bednets and the new vaccine are only 40% effective, said Alonso. \u201cSmallpox had a very safe, highly effective vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cSo does polio, which is close to eradication. \u201cWe will always fall short of eradication because our tools are imperfect,. They have allowed us to make huge progress over the last 15 years, but they are far from being a silver bullet in any shape or form. \u201cOur priority now should be to establish the foundation for a successful future eradication effort while guarding against the risk of failure that would lead to the waste of huge sums of money, frustrate all those involved, national governments and malaria experts alike, and cause a lack of confidence in the global health community\u2019s ability to ever rid the world of this disease,\u201d said the report. Progress has stalled in the last two years in efforts to meet the target of 90% reduction in cases by 2030, it says. It calls for a major investment of $34bn (\u00a328bn) to scale up current interventions over the next 11 years and strong political leadership to ensure affordable healthcare in affected countries. Better data on malaria transmission is also needed and better tools to control mosquitoes and protect and treat people in malarial regions. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 August 2019 to remove an incorrect date reference in relation to the support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.",
