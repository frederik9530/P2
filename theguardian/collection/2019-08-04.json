      "bodyText": "Parts of the pension industry are making a \u201cfat living\u201d from people\u2019s savings and should come under tougher scrutiny, MPs have said. In a damning Commons report, the work and pensions committee called for the government to take urgent action against pension funds that fail to disclose how much they charge savers, saying it is \u201cunconvinced\u201d that the industry will act voluntarily on providing transparent information about the costs and charges of investments. MPs have called for providers behind the charges to face the \u201cfull force of the law\u201d, accusing them of \u201cmisinforming, mischarging, overcharging\u201d on the savings of pensioners. Such charges are \u201ceroding the value of individuals\u2019 savings,\u201d they said. Using the example of one pension fund which first reported it had \u00a310m in management costs before being forced to revise the figure to \u00a392m, MPs have said that many schemes are not aware of their costs. The inquiry also found that of the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s staff of 3,700, the scams team consisted of around only 10 people. The report calls for the government to bring forward legislation obliging funds to disclose the cost of investment in a uniform template. Frank Field, the independent MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cRipping off pension savers could be eliminated.\u201d It said the government should also publish a timetable by the end of this year for the roll-out of a non-commercial pensions dashboard. Lady Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, compared the industry as it stands to \u201cshoppers going into a supermarket and seeing similar-looking products on the shelves, but the prices are hidden\u201d. \u201cDisplaying prices clearly for customers should be one of the most basic elements of a product sale, yet in pensions it seems to be an \u2018optional extra\u2019,\u201d she said. The committee said it is important for trustees and others managing pension schemes to demonstrate whether or not they are delivering value for money in a way which can be compared across the industry and is accessible to the scheme members. Calls to make the cost of pension investment more transparent come after the inquiry found \u201cworrying evidence\u201d that some trustees are making investment decisions without a clear understanding of the costs. A previous report on the British Steel pension scheme found that members were \u201cshamelessly bamboozled\u201d by advisers and unregulated introducers into signing up to ongoing adviser fees, unsuitable pension products and investments, characterised by high investment risk, high management charges and punitive exit fees. A Department of Work and Pensions spokesman said: \u201cWe have taken decisive action to limit charges and make the costs of saving into a pension more transparent. \u201cWe capped charges for millions of people saving through automatic enrolment at 0.75% and we legislated to ensure that all costs are set out to savers alongside their annual statements. \u201cWe\u2019re backing pension dashboards and expect the first models to be ready for testing later this year.\u201d",

Justifiably famous around the world, Sutton Hoo was nonetheless best known for treasures which were no longer there. The wooden ship and the body it contained had long since vanished into the acid soil, the riches it once contained were 100 miles away in London.

They can also walk new paths around the site, revealing the mounds of the royal burial grounds in context. The Trust hopes the revamp will help connect visitors more viscerally to the stories behind the lumps in Sutton Hoo\u2019s sandy earth.</p> <p>Later this year, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-41475041\">17-metre observation tower</a> will open, offering a view over the landscape in which an entire royal dynasty is believed to have been laid to rest. In the words of Hopwood, who led the four-year transformation project, \u201cwe wanted to put in some wows, some pops\u201d. The \u00a34m project has been aided by a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6be0cf2ef93e1ebd3fa573cec4e7fb4130f14a60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6be0cf2ef93e1ebd3fa573cec4e7fb4130f14a60/0_0_3312_4140/800.jpg\" alt=\"The planned observation tower that will open later this year.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The planned observation tower that will open later this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9Nissen Richards Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a challenge faced by many museums and heritage sites, where the focus is increasingly moving from individual exhibits to overall visitor experiences. At \u201cbucket-list\u201d sites like Sutton Hoo in particular \u2013 40% of whose visitors currently travel for more than two hours to see it \u2013 a few dusty exhibit cases and a fibreglass model of a figure clutching something shiny wouldn\u2019t quite cut it.</p> <p>\u201cPeople\u2019s expectations are changing all the time,\u201d says Ian Barnes, head of archaeology for the National Trust. \u201cWhat wowed people [in the past], now in the age of CGI films and computer games, people would look at and it wouldn\u2019t impress them at all.\u201d</p> <p>Capturing the interest of visitors need not be particularly technologically inventive \u2013 the stars of Sutton Hoo\u2019s exhibition hall remain the reconstructions of the great ship burial treasures, along with artefacts excavated from some of the site\u2019s other rich graves. But visitors do have to be engaged with a narrative, according to Hopwood. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work harder to give people a really emotional connection to the stories.\u201d</p> <p>At Sutton Hoo, that includes telling the remarkable stories not only of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nb0t0\">Raedwald</a>, the seventh-century king who is most widely believed to have been buried with the treasure, but of the discovery of his grave, when <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sutton-hoo/features/find-out-what-led-to-the-discovery\">Edith Pretty</a>, who owned the estate, decided in 1938 to engage a local amateur archaeologist to investigate the mounds in her field. Her former home, which overlooks the burial site, has been transformed by the Trust into an interactive space which juxtaposes the dramatic moments in the ship burial\u2019s discovery with the ominous global events that made its safe excavation so urgent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dcbdc1ae46fba4144b407aa8d57874d97831282\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dcbdc1ae46fba4144b407aa8d57874d97831282/0_131_6016_3608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the burial mounds and Tranmer House, the home of Edith Pretty who instigated the Sutton Hoo digs in 1939.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the burial mounds and Tranmer House, the home of Edith Pretty who instigated the Sutton Hoo digs in 1939.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Brooks/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And while the royal burial grounds of Sutton Hoo remain, in essence, a series of bumps in a grassy field, Hopwood hopes that approaching them via a new route, likely the path taken by the ship when it was hauled uphill from the nearby River Deben, will fire the imagination in a new way.</p> <p>\u201cIf people ask what I am doing here, I say: I\u2019m putting the tingle in the hairs on the back of people\u2019s necks when they come here as they stand before the site.

Visitors will see an enormous, full-size sculpture of the Anglo-Saxon ship \u2013 27 metres(89ft) long and 4 metres (13ft) high at its ends like the imprint of the ship\u2019s remains uncovered in 1939 \u2013 and dramatic new audiovisual displays, centred around reconstructions of the treasures and exhibits showing how they were made. They can also walk new paths around the site, revealing the mounds of the royal burial grounds in context. The Trust hopes the revamp will help connect visitors more viscerally to the stories behind the lumps in Sutton Hoo\u2019s sandy earth. Later this year, a 17-metre observation tower will open, offering a view over the landscape in which an entire royal dynasty is believed to have been laid to rest. In the words of Hopwood, who led the four-year transformation project, \u201cwe wanted to put in some wows, some pops\u201d. The \u00a34m project has been aided by a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. It is a challenge faced by many museums and heritage sites, where the focus is increasingly moving from individual exhibits to overall visitor experiences. At \u201cbucket-list\u201d sites like Sutton Hoo in particular \u2013 40% of whose visitors currently travel for more than two hours to see it \u2013 a few dusty exhibit cases and a fibreglass model of a figure clutching something shiny wouldn\u2019t quite cut it. \u201cPeople\u2019s expectations are changing all the time,\u201d says Ian Barnes, head of archaeology for the National Trust. \u201cWhat wowed people [in the past], now in the age of CGI films and computer games, people would look at and it wouldn\u2019t impress them at all.\u201d Capturing the interest of visitors need not be particularly technologically inventive \u2013 the stars of Sutton Hoo\u2019s exhibition hall remain the reconstructions of the great ship burial treasures, along with artefacts excavated from some of the site\u2019s other rich graves. But visitors do have to be engaged with a narrative, according to Hopwood. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work harder to give people a really emotional connection to the stories.\u201d At Sutton Hoo, that includes telling the remarkable stories not only of Raedwald, the seventh-century king who is most widely believed to have been buried with the treasure, but of the discovery of his grave, when Edith Pretty, who owned the estate, decided in 1938 to engage a local amateur archaeologist to investigate the mounds in her field. Her former home, which overlooks the burial site, has been transformed by the Trust into an interactive space which juxtaposes the dramatic moments in the ship burial\u2019s discovery with the ominous global events that made its safe excavation so urgent. And while the royal burial grounds of Sutton Hoo remain, in essence, a series of bumps in a grassy field, Hopwood hopes that approaching them via a new route, likely the path taken by the ship when it was hauled uphill from the nearby River Deben, will fire the imagination in a new way. \u201cIf people ask what I am doing here, I say: I\u2019m putting the tingle in the hairs on the back of people\u2019s necks when they come here as they stand before the site. It\u2019s putting a story to what you are seeing.\u201d Tranmer House, Edith Pretty\u2019s former home, and the Sutton Hoo Exhibition Hall open to visitors on Monday 5 August",

It is an act of such unfathomable cruelty, it seems futile to try. It would take an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/09/kenneth-cranham-on-joe-orton-playwright-the-charming-mischief-maker\">Ortonesque</a> farce to come close to that kind of darkness, or at least a subtle analysis of the incremental nature of evil, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/23/good-cp-taylor-manchester-review\">CP Taylor\u2019s Good</a>. But that hasn\u2019t put off playwright Jessica Ross from trying to make sense of it all.</p> \n<p>Maybe, she postulates, one of the nurses was a battered wife; maybe one was a neglected single mother; maybe one had suffered a family tragedy; and maybe one was a lesbian (because, as we know, lesbians are always murdering people).</p> \n<p>Well, yes, maybe they were all of those things, but as there are plenty of abused, neglected and traumatised women who haven\u2019t killed 200 people, it hardly explains anything. If these were mercy killings, we\u2019d need more information. \u201cThere\u2019s more than one way to show mercy,\u201d says one nurse at the end, as if there was some kind of moral ambiguity in which killing 200 people were OK. On this evidence, \u201cNo, there isn\u2019t,\u201d is the only answer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"78adf7a8-43b9-487c-bf2e-3087ad01787e\"

      "bodyText": "How to account for the four Austrian nurses who murdered up to 200 patients in the 1980s? It is an act of such unfathomable cruelty, it seems futile to try. It would take an Ortonesque farce to come close to that kind of darkness, or at least a subtle analysis of the incremental nature of evil, such as CP Taylor\u2019s Good. But that hasn\u2019t put off playwright Jessica Ross from trying to make sense of it all. Maybe, she postulates, one of the nurses was a battered wife; maybe one was a neglected single mother; maybe one had suffered a family tragedy; and maybe one was a lesbian (because, as we know, lesbians are always murdering people). Well, yes, maybe they were all of those things, but as there are plenty of abused, neglected and traumatised women who haven\u2019t killed 200 people, it hardly explains anything. If these were mercy killings, we\u2019d need more information. \u201cThere\u2019s more than one way to show mercy,\u201d says one nurse at the end, as if there was some kind of moral ambiguity in which killing 200 people were OK. On this evidence, \u201cNo, there isn\u2019t,\u201d is the only answer. The ethical argument aside, the dramatic novelty of killing people wears thin, so Ross falls back on what David Mamet calls the \u201cdeath-of-my-kitten\u201d speech, a retrospective soliloquy that delays the action before the denouement.

      "body": "<p>Low-income households in Britain are more vulnerable to recession than they were before the financial crisis, the Resolution Foundation has warned, amid the mounting risks of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> downturn.</p> <p>According to the thinktank, a decade of weak wage growth has left the poorest UK households and middle-income families less prepared for another downturn. It also warned the gradual dismantling of the benefits system under the policy of austerity imposed over the past decade by Conservative-led governments has left people without the same degree of support.</p> <p>The warning comes ahead of official growth figures for the second quarter, due this Friday, that are expected to show the British economy stalled or slid into contraction for the first time since 2012 during the three months to June.</p> <p>Two consecutive quarters of contraction are regarded as a recession. The last time the UK suffered a period of falling GDP was during the 2008 financial crisis, which caused the loss of more than 1m jobs as unemployment rose to its highest level since the 1990s.</p> <p>City economists polled by Reuters expect Friday\u2019s data to reveal zero growth in the second quarter. However, many economists believe GDP will have contracted, including the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Considered among Britain\u2019s leading thinktanks, NIESR warned that GDP may have fallen by 0.2%.</p> <p>The warning signals for the economy come after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> said last week that Britain has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/01/bank-of-england-warns-1-in-3-chance--brexit-recession-interest-rates\">one-in-three chance of plunging into recession</a> at the start of 2020, even if a no-deal Brexit can be avoided.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street said chronic uncertainty facing British businesses over the future EU trading relationship, as well as slowing international trade volumes due to the US-China trade war, was serving as a handbrake on the economy.</p> <p>Even if Boris Johnson manages to agree a new Brexit deal with Brussels, it said there was a 33% chance of a recession at the start of 2020. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has said there would be an even worse \u201cinstantaneous shock\u201d to growth. He warned that the pound would fall sharply, driving up inflation to further squeeze household spending power.</p> <p>Should Britain sink into another downturn, the Resolution Foundation warned that poor households would struggle most.</p> <p>James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWe know from previous downturns that it is lower income households that bear the brunt of economic downturns when it comes to their living standards.</p> <p>\u201cThe global slowdown and continued Brexit uncertainty are making recession preparedness even more urgent. In its response, the government should consider policies that limit and mitigate the effects of the recession, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.\u201d</p> <p>By analysing household spending patterns over the past decade, the thinktank found that poor families were forced to tighten their belts to a greater extent than the rich in the years that followed the 2008 crash.</p> <p>While the average fall in spending between 2009 and 2014 was \u00a320 per week, families in the lowest 25% income bracket in Britain focused on buying essentials and cut back over three times more, at \u00a361 a week.</p> <p>It also said low and middle-income families had yet to recover. Average salaries in Britain have failed to rise above the level recorded before the financial crisis after inflation is taken into account.</p> <p>Pay growth is on track to complete the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/13/uk-wages-squeeze-continue-until-2022-resolution-foundation-warns\">weakest decade since the final decade of the Napoleonic wars</a> in the 1810s. Wages fell by \u00a332 a week on average after inflation between 2008 and 2014.</p> <p>In its analysis, the Resolution Foundation said that a decade of weak wage growth had left poorer households with less scope to cut down on essentials, while a higher proportion than before the last crash had no savings upon which to draw.</p> <p>Despite some reductions in their debts, as many as 60% of lower income households have nothing to put aside, up by about a quarter since the financial crisis, it said.</p> <p>The value of benefits relative to average earnings has declined markedly since the financial crisis, and is on course to decline further. Jobseeker\u2019s allowance is set to reach its lowest value ever in 2019-20, at 14.5% of average weekly pay, a fall of 5 percentage points since 2009-10.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation said the government needed to take greater steps to prepare Britain for a recession.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the next recession hits \u2013 as it surely will \u2013 there is every chance that it is particularly damaging for those low-to-middle income households that are already close to the edge.</p> <p>\u201cThe policy response will matter, but so too will the action taken ahead of any future downturn,\u201d it warned.</p>",

The warning comes ahead of official growth figures for the second quarter, due this Friday, that are expected to show the British economy stalled or slid into contraction for the first time since 2012 during the three months to June. Two consecutive quarters of contraction are regarded as a recession. The last time the UK suffered a period of falling GDP was during the 2008 financial crisis, which caused the loss of more than 1m jobs as unemployment rose to its highest level since the 1990s. City economists polled by Reuters expect Friday\u2019s data to reveal zero growth in the second quarter. However, many economists believe GDP will have contracted, including the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Considered among Britain\u2019s leading thinktanks, NIESR warned that GDP may have fallen by 0.2%. The warning signals for the economy come after the Bank of England said last week that Britain has a one-in-three chance of plunging into recession at the start of 2020, even if a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. Threadneedle Street said chronic uncertainty facing British businesses over the future EU trading relationship, as well as slowing international trade volumes due to the US-China trade war, was serving as a handbrake on the economy. Even if Boris Johnson manages to agree a new Brexit deal with Brussels, it said there was a 33% chance of a recession at the start of 2020. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has said there would be an even worse \u201cinstantaneous shock\u201d to growth. He warned that the pound would fall sharply, driving up inflation to further squeeze household spending power. Should Britain sink into another downturn, the Resolution Foundation warned that poor households would struggle most. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWe know from previous downturns that it is lower income households that bear the brunt of economic downturns when it comes to their living standards. \u201cThe global slowdown and continued Brexit uncertainty are making recession preparedness even more urgent. In its response, the government should consider policies that limit and mitigate the effects of the recession, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.\u201d By analysing household spending patterns over the past decade, the thinktank found that poor families were forced to tighten their belts to a greater extent than the rich in the years that followed the 2008 crash. While the average fall in spending between 2009 and 2014 was \u00a320 per week, families in the lowest 25% income bracket in Britain focused on buying essentials and cut back over three times more, at \u00a361 a week. It also said low and middle-income families had yet to recover. Average salaries in Britain have failed to rise above the level recorded before the financial crisis after inflation is taken into account. Pay growth is on track to complete the weakest decade since the final decade of the Napoleonic wars in the 1810s. Wages fell by \u00a332 a week on average after inflation between 2008 and 2014. In its analysis, the Resolution Foundation said that a decade of weak wage growth had left poorer households with less scope to cut down on essentials, while a higher proportion than before the last crash had no savings upon which to draw. Despite some reductions in their debts, as many as 60% of lower income households have nothing to put aside, up by about a quarter since the financial crisis, it said. The value of benefits relative to average earnings has declined markedly since the financial crisis, and is on course to decline further. Jobseeker\u2019s allowance is set to reach its lowest value ever in 2019-20, at 14.5% of average weekly pay, a fall of 5 percentage points since 2009-10. The Resolution Foundation said the government needed to take greater steps to prepare Britain for a recession. \u201cWhen the next recession hits \u2013 as it surely will \u2013 there is every chance that it is particularly damaging for those low-to-middle income households that are already close to the edge. \u201cThe policy response will matter, but so too will the action taken ahead of any future downturn,\u201d it warned.",

      "bodyText": "The government of Zambia has defended its efforts to kick London-based copper miner Vedanta Resources out of the country, in an escalating row over tax and alleged underinvestment. The southern African nation\u2019s national mining vehicle, ZCCM, is seeking to have Vedanta subsidiary Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), its partner in the country\u2019s largest copper mine, placed into liquidation. Vedanta responded earlier this week by seeking to have the case referred to arbitration in South Africa. The Zambian government, including its president, Edgar Lungu, has accused KCM of underpayment of dividends and taxes, as well as underinvestment in the mine, a crucial plank in Zambia\u2019s copper-fuelled economy. It appointed a liquidator to run the company in May. \u201cWe need the dividends from that mine to invest in schools, to invest in hospitals,\u201d the Zambian information minister, Dora Siliya, said. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep talking like this over and over. We want a partner that we can work with so we can invest elsewhere. The time for mediation is over.\u201d \u201cThis is not nationalisation, it is not compulsory liquidation, it is following law.\u201d She added that local suppliers in Zambia\u2019s mining region, known as the Copperbelt, had been made to wait for payments, hurting the local economy. She said the liquidator trying to sell Vedanta\u2019s 80% stake in the mine had already had visits from Chinese, Turkish and Russian firms keen to buy it. A South African court has ruled that the sale process should be halted but the government has pressed on regardless. One source within the Zambian tax authorities said the company owed about $100m (\u00a382m) in VAT, customs duties and other taxes, even once refunds due to the company were taken into account. The source added that KCM, which has previously been criticised over pollution, has also withheld $10m (\u00a38.2m) in dividend payments. \u201cOn the balance of numbers they owe the government more than they are owed. They\u2019ve not been consistent in meeting their tax obligations. It\u2019s a worsening situation.\u201d Vedanta disputed this, saying that it was owed $164m (\u00a3139m) by the Zambian Revenue Authority and had not been informed about outstanding payments it was required to make. The Indian-owned company said it had \u201cfulfilled its commitments\u201d in Zambia and was concerned about the \u201capparent misuse of the legal process\u201d by ZCCM. It said it had paid $2.3bn (\u00a31.9bn) in wages, $1.2bn (\u00a31bn) in power bills and $700m (\u00a3576m) in taxes and royalties since 2006, as well as $72m (\u00a359m) in dividends. It admitted KCM had made local suppliers wait for payment but blamed this on the financial stresses caused by the tripling of power costs, tax increases, import restrictions on copper concentrate and the government\u2019s failure to pay VAT refunds. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2019.

In the letter sent on Monday, seen by the Guardian, he said: \u201cIt will not be lost on those that have suffered the consequences of the last nine years of austerity following the 2008 financial crisis that the newly appointed chancellor profited from the greed that contributed to it.\u201d Before his election as the Conservative MP for Bromsgrove in 2010, Javid had an 18-year career in the City, and latterly with Deutsche Bank in Asia.

Deutsche Bank has spent more than $18bn (\u00a315bn) on fines and to settle legal disputes in the past decade, according to Bloomberg. McDonnell said Javid was a senior office holder at the German bank around the time that a US Senate committee concluded it had inflicted \u201cmaterial damage to ordinary people and the wider global economy\u201d. He referred to a report by the financial magazine Euromoney, that said: \u201c[Javid] was responsible for structuring an emerging-market synthetic CDOs that incurred millions of dollars worth of losses for investors.\u201d According to the magazine, Javid worked at Deutsche Bank when it sold $500m (\u00a3411m) of collateralised loan obligations (CLOs) \u2013 similar to CDOs but using loans rather than bonds \u2013 to investors who later sued the German bank for losses of as much as $37m (\u00a330m).

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s largest retailer has joined the crackdown on glitter by switching to a plastic-free version for its Christmas range of trees, plants and flowers this year. With 142 days to go until Christmas, Tesco said shoppers would first notice the difference in its popular fresh trees that will go on sale towards the end of November. Most glitter is made from etched aluminium bonded to polyethylene terephthalate \u2013 a form of microplastic that can find its way into the oceans. As well as being an environmental scourge, the substance can pose a danger to people and animals. Tesco\u2019s plans to launch an eco-friendly, biodegradable glitter in its Christmas horticulture range follows a wider review, but there is no date yet for removing the conventional product from its own-brand cards, stationery and wrapping paper. Michelle Buck, Tesco\u2019s product development manager for horticulture, said: \u201cCustomers tell us they want us to use less plastic. This is one of the ways we\u2019re trying to help at Christmas.\u201d A petition launched earlier this year by the campaign group 38 Degrees \u2013 attracting support from more than 6,000 signatories \u2013 called on the then environment secretary Michael Gove to ban glitter as part of the government\u2019s wider crackdown on single-use plastics. It cited a study showing that up to a third of fish caught in the North Sea contained microplastic particles \u2013 including glitter. David Innes, of 38 Degrees, said: \u201cThe news that Tesco is removing glitter from flowers, plants and trees this Christmas is great but it\u2019s extremely disappointing that they are not going a step further by removing it from cards and wrapping paper. Glitter from these products will be around long after the sparkle of this coming Christmas has past. That\u2019s why so many people signed the petition calling for the government to ban plastic glitter.\u201d Supermarkets are acting amid wider moves in society, with the BBC TV show Strictly Come Dancing banning the use of traditional glitter last year and growing numbers of nursery schools and music festivals also axing it. In December last year, Waitrose pledged to ban glitter from all own-brand products by 2020. The supermarket chain said its own-label cards, wraps, crackers, tags, flowers and plants will either be glitter-free or use an environmentally friendly alternative. The discount chain Aldi is scrapping plastic glitter from this year\u2019s Halloween range \u2013 meaning no more sparkly fake pumpkins \u2013 as well as from this year\u2019s Christmas cards and wrapping paper. The move \u2013 in all 825 UK and 130 Ireland stores \u2013 is part of a pledge to remove non-biodegradable glitter from all products by the end of 2020, it said. Retailer Hobbycraft has also launched biodegradable alternatives, including a craft bio-glitter for children\u2019s use, and has recently pledged that its range will be free of plastic glitter by 2021, compared with an earlier target of 2023.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who is now the Lib Dem Treasury and business spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/13/chuka-umunna-joins-liberal-democrats-after-quitting-change-uk\">after defecting to the party</a>, said he had obtained figures from the government showing that just 66,000 of these traders had an EORI number.

      "bodyText": "The gunman who opened fire in Dayton, Ohio, killing nine people early Sunday, was armed with a high-powered rifle and a 100-round magazine before police shot him dead within 30 seconds of his beginning a rampage in the city\u2019s downtown area, the authorities said on Sunday evening. The Dayton police chief, Richard Biehl, told reporters that the shooting did not appear linked to a \u201cbias motive\u201d. The massacre took place within 13 hours of another mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, that claimed 20 lives, injured at least two dozen more, and is being investigated by the federal authorities as a hate crime. Law enforcement named the Dayton shooter as 24-year-old Connor Betts. Earlier in the day the police department named all nine of the victims, which included the shooter\u2019s 22-year-old younger sister, Megan Betts. The others were named as: 27-year-old Lois Oglesby, 38-year-old Saeed Saleh, 57-year-old Derrick Fudge, 30-year-old Logan Turner, 25-year-old Nicholas Cumer, 25-year-old Thomas McNichols, 36-year-old Beatrice Warren-Curtis, and 39-year-old Monica Brickhouse. Early reports suggest there may have been red flags in the gunman\u2019s history. Former high school classmates, speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said that Betts had been suspended from school over a \u201chit list\u201d found scrawled in a school bathroom. The suspension followed an earlier disciplinary action after Betts came to school with a list of female students he wanted to sexually assault, according to the two classmates. The accounts emerged after police said there was nothing in the 24-year-old\u2019s background that would have prevented him from purchasing the rifle with extended ammunition magazines. Biehl indicated the shooter had bought both the firearm and the high-capacity, drum-style magazine legally. Biehl said the shooter had fired \u201cdozens\u201d of rounds before he was shot outside a downtown bar in the Oregon district of the Ohio city. Had the six officers involved in the response not acted so quickly, said chief Biehl, there would have been further \u201ccatastrophic injury and loss of life\u201d due to the \u201clevel of weaponry\u201d possessed by the shooter. Roy Kanpari, a 24-year-old merchandise salesman who witnessed the shooting and posted images to social media, told the Guardian in a phone interview he saw the shooter approach the Ned Peppers bar from an alleyway to the side. He said the shooter wore a black bandana mask across his face and said: \u201cThe McRib is back\u201d before he opened fire. \u201cIt was definitely chaotic,\u201d Kanpari said. \u201cI felt like I needed to get out of there \u2026 I needed to get out of the line of fire.\u201d Authorities said that the shooter had arrived in the downtown area in the same vehicle as his sister and another male friend, but the shooter had split from his sister at some point during the evening, before the shooting began. The incident was still in the early stages of investigation and it was too early to assign a motive, according to chief Biehl. At an earlier briefing the Republican senator from Ohio, Rob Portman, deflected questions about gun control in the wake of the shooting, and focussed on praising law enforcement\u2019s response. \u201cThis courage was extraordinary, and saved lives \u2013 probably hundreds of lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m impressed with how this community comes together and responds.\u201d Speaking to CNN after the Sunday evening briefing, the Democratic senator and 2020 presidential election candidate Amy Klobuchar, a moderate from Minnesota, joined calls to convene an emergency session of the US Senate. She also called for a ban on sales of assault weapons. She accused Donald Trump of talking \u201ca good game for the cameras\u201d, after the president said on Sunday \u201cthings are being done\u201d but then, according to Klobuchar, \u201cfolding\u201d to groups like the National Rifle Association. Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a gun control act in February this year, which would create new background checks for gun transfers between unlicensed people. The Senate majority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell, has described the two mass shootings over the weekend as \u201chorrifying acts of violence\u201d but has indicated no sympathy for an emergency debate on the bill.",

      "body": "<p>The word immigrant stems from the Latin root, <em>migrare</em> \u2013 to change or to move from one place to another. Australia, where 28% of the population was born overseas, owes its transformation from a British colony to a cosmopolitan modern country to the presence of people from other places who\u2019ve arrived here to build new lives.</p> <p>The following stories represent five moments during the trajectory of the past five decades of Australian immigration \u2013 from the last wave of postwar European immigration to the focus on humanitarian arrivals in the 1980s to the present, a period during which aspiring Australians on temporary visas struggle to put down roots.

When I came to Australia in 1976, I couldn\u2019t speak English, so I worked in a factory. Then, I bought a guillotine and made my first frames for relatives and friends. In 1978 when I was 24, I started my framing business [Rococo Framing on Newtown\u2019s Enmore Road] with a partner. After a year, I took over the business. We supplied galleries and studios with ornate frames. In those days, everything was made by hand and it was tough. I was young and could work hard but made the big mistake of not studying proper English. I still don\u2019t like to communicate with emails. I prefer phone calls. But although I don\u2019t advertise or have a website, my customers come from everywhere.</p> <p>Forty years ago, there were no tables on the sidewalks in Australia. No one drank coffee, there were only milk bars. Back home, we said good morning. Here, we walk in the street, we don\u2019t talk. In some ways, life was easier there and the cost of living was lower. In Australia, we have good systems, but we pay for them. Athens was very modern, and you could get a shave at the hairdresser.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"498ba9d9b8bb3981f50f64ece8f393e2370da200\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/498ba9d9b8bb3981f50f64ece8f393e2370da200/0_0_4426_3319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"book and flag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Kalogeropoulos\u2019s copy of You speak Greek, you just don\u2019t know it, by Annie Stefanides, a book that highlights the many English language words that have roots in Greek.

But I remember when I moved to Australia people would leave an envelope outside the door for the milkman and no one would touch that money. It was a beautiful thing.</p> <p>When I moved here, people mostly came from Europe. I was one of the last generations of Greeks to arrive. Now people come from India and China so there are different challenges. When we first came here, it was racist, and we had a tough time. My sisters had bad experiences in the 60s, but things have changed a lot. I think that Australia should be open to any nationality. We make Australia, we are all Australian. But when I\u2019m in Australia, I miss Greece. There\u2019s nothing like home for anyone.</p> <h2><strong>Lan Vo, 1981, Ho Chi Minh City</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c900b44dc3e292c1aef3273d68e9a275adc083f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c900b44dc3e292c1aef3273d68e9a275adc083f8/0_0_4663_6218/750.jpg\" alt=\"Lan Vo who migrated to Australia in 1981 from Ho Chi Minh City.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lan Vo who migrated to Australia in 1981 from Ho Chi Minh City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel McLaughlin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I grew up in Vietnam and came to Australia on a boat with 47 people. I was on a boat for four days and [because I was pregnant] it was very scary. I was in Thailand for eight and a half months and then we flew to Sydney. We lived in Guilford, then in Auburn and I cooked for three men and looked after three boys for $20 each. Back then, rent was only $65 a week. I learned how to use a sewing machine and worked day and night. The government gave us blankets and a bed, and we were happy.</p> <p>After I bought my first house, I bought 12 machines, then 18 machines and after that I had machines [all around my] living room and my business grew and grew. I started my business in 1983 under my name, Lan Vo. Then I rented the factory, although my ex-husband said, \u201cif you rent a factory I\u2019ll leave you and go to America.\u201d So, I did everything by myself. I bought this business [Mimosa Fashions, a wholesaler and retailer of watches and custom jewellery] in 1987.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c8693abb05379a6f964d3f018b223af2e7a920d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c8693abb05379a6f964d3f018b223af2e7a920d/0_374_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Earrings and rings that accompanied Lan Vo on the long journey from Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Earrings and rings that accompanied Lan Vo on the long journey from Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel McLaughlin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First it was clothing that I designed myself, although I couldn\u2019t draw. When I started selling wedding dresses, I did well. Sometimes, I worked 23 hours and slept only one hour. But that is why I have money right now. I also had to send money back to my country, to my parents. Then, when my sister and brother came from Vietnam and Singapore, I [supported them].</p> <p>Thanks to God, I\u2019ve had a beautiful life. I go back to Vietnam every year, but I love Australia, it accepts me. I [had to] come here for my children. My country is hard, because it is new but [in Australia] it doesn\u2019t matter who you are. When we lived in Thailand, it was very difficult because I was pregnant and didn\u2019t have enough food. But it made me more determined. [In the future] I hope my son and daughter and my grandchildren do well. And right now, business is good \u2014 I have customers who\u2019ve come back to me for 32 years.</p> <h2><strong>Ai Ling Zhou, 1987, Shanghai</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c8f045ea3ed9b2b7f1a827e40508052e5c4013a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c8f045ea3ed9b2b7f1a827e40508052e5c4013a/0_0_4000_5334/750.jpg\" alt=\"Ai Ling Zhou, who migrated to Australia in 1987 from Shanghai. 14 June 2019\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ai Ling Zhou, who migrated to Australia in 1987 from Shanghai. 14 June 2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel McLaughlin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I left China, I had studied material science engineering and worked for two years. Graduates at the time were appointed [to jobs] by a university and [the state] would send us to workplaces. I felt politically oppressed and didn\u2019t see any hope. At the time, Australia was seen as a peaceful country. On the plane, I saw Sydney harbour. The sky was so blue, the clouds were so white, and the sun was so warm. A week later, I was walking down George Street and a white man in his late 30s tried to bump into me. I was so scared. But then a lady said: \u201cWalk with me.\u201d She walked me to a shop and I felt safe.</p> <p>Culture-wise, Australia was difficult. My degree in China was not recognised so I waitressed while I was studying English and that was depressing because I felt I was an engineer. Before the Tiananmen Square massacre, I was excited because I thought China would change. But after the massacre, it was devastating. [In 1989] Bob Hawke gave us a four-year temporary residency visa, along with 40,000 Chinese students and in 1993, Paul Keating allowed us to become permanent residents. We could work full-time without fear of being sent back to China.

I told him he could retire when he was 43.</p> <p>From the age of 17, I was sitting in the shop for 18 hours a day for seven years straight. Redfern between 2000 and 2003 was tough.

      "bodyText": "The word immigrant stems from the Latin root, migrare \u2013 to change or to move from one place to another. Australia, where 28% of the population was born overseas, owes its transformation from a British colony to a cosmopolitan modern country to the presence of people from other places who\u2019ve arrived here to build new lives. The following stories represent five moments during the trajectory of the past five decades of Australian immigration \u2013 from the last wave of postwar European immigration to the focus on humanitarian arrivals in the 1980s to the present, a period during which aspiring Australians on temporary visas struggle to put down roots. Each of the stories is accompanied by a photo of an object, something important that reminds them of their homeland. Nick Kalogeropoulos, 1976, Athens In Athens, I studied to be a computer programmer at night and worked as a framer during the day. When I came to Australia in 1976, I couldn\u2019t speak English, so I worked in a factory. Then, I bought a guillotine and made my first frames for relatives and friends. In 1978 when I was 24, I started my framing business [Rococo Framing on Newtown\u2019s Enmore Road] with a partner. After a year, I took over the business. We supplied galleries and studios with ornate frames. In those days, everything was made by hand and it was tough. I was young and could work hard but made the big mistake of not studying proper English. I still don\u2019t like to communicate with emails. I prefer phone calls. But although I don\u2019t advertise or have a website, my customers come from everywhere. Forty years ago, there were no tables on the sidewalks in Australia. No one drank coffee, there were only milk bars. Back home, we said good morning. Here, we walk in the street, we don\u2019t talk. In some ways, life was easier there and the cost of living was lower. In Australia, we have good systems, but we pay for them. Athens was very modern, and you could get a shave at the hairdresser. When I first visited a Greek barber in Australia and asked for a shave, he said, \u201cyou can forget that here\u201d. But I remember when I moved to Australia people would leave an envelope outside the door for the milkman and no one would touch that money. It was a beautiful thing. When I moved here, people mostly came from Europe. I was one of the last generations of Greeks to arrive. Now people come from India and China so there are different challenges. When we first came here, it was racist, and we had a tough time. My sisters had bad experiences in the 60s, but things have changed a lot. I think that Australia should be open to any nationality. We make Australia, we are all Australian. But when I\u2019m in Australia, I miss Greece. There\u2019s nothing like home for anyone. Lan Vo, 1981, Ho Chi Minh City I grew up in Vietnam and came to Australia on a boat with 47 people. I was on a boat for four days and [because I was pregnant] it was very scary. I was in Thailand for eight and a half months and then we flew to Sydney. We lived in Guilford, then in Auburn and I cooked for three men and looked after three boys for $20 each. Back then, rent was only $65 a week. I learned how to use a sewing machine and worked day and night. The government gave us blankets and a bed, and we were happy. After I bought my first house, I bought 12 machines, then 18 machines and after that I had machines [all around my] living room and my business grew and grew. I started my business in 1983 under my name, Lan Vo. Then I rented the factory, although my ex-husband said, \u201cif you rent a factory I\u2019ll leave you and go to America.\u201d So, I did everything by myself. I bought this business [Mimosa Fashions, a wholesaler and retailer of watches and custom jewellery] in 1987. First it was clothing that I designed myself, although I couldn\u2019t draw. When I started selling wedding dresses, I did well. Sometimes, I worked 23 hours and slept only one hour. But that is why I have money right now. I also had to send money back to my country, to my parents. Then, when my sister and brother came from Vietnam and Singapore, I [supported them]. Thanks to God, I\u2019ve had a beautiful life. I go back to Vietnam every year, but I love Australia, it accepts me. I [had to] come here for my children. My country is hard, because it is new but [in Australia] it doesn\u2019t matter who you are. When we lived in Thailand, it was very difficult because I was pregnant and didn\u2019t have enough food. But it made me more determined. [In the future] I hope my son and daughter and my grandchildren do well. And right now, business is good \u2014 I have customers who\u2019ve come back to me for 32 years. Ai Ling Zhou, 1987, Shanghai When I left China, I had studied material science engineering and worked for two years. Graduates at the time were appointed [to jobs] by a university and [the state] would send us to workplaces. I felt politically oppressed and didn\u2019t see any hope. At the time, Australia was seen as a peaceful country. On the plane, I saw Sydney harbour. The sky was so blue, the clouds were so white, and the sun was so warm. A week later, I was walking down George Street and a white man in his late 30s tried to bump into me. I was so scared. But then a lady said: \u201cWalk with me.\u201d She walked me to a shop and I felt safe. Culture-wise, Australia was difficult. My degree in China was not recognised so I waitressed while I was studying English and that was depressing because I felt I was an engineer. Before the Tiananmen Square massacre, I was excited because I thought China would change. But after the massacre, it was devastating. [In 1989] Bob Hawke gave us a four-year temporary residency visa, along with 40,000 Chinese students and in 1993, Paul Keating allowed us to become permanent residents. We could work full-time without fear of being sent back to China. It was an opportunity to start again. In 1994, I applied to Sydney University to complete postgraduate studies in economics, which changed my life. But the lecturer spoke so fast and [the field] required a lot of English. I grew up in China, a planned economy. I had no knowledge of market economies. Now, I enjoy it but at the time, I was overwhelmed. I think immigration has made it easier for Australia to adapt to the international market. But racism happens when people feel threatened. Chinese-Australian friends say that colleagues can be friendly but when a position comes along, they feel like they should have it rather than you. But I was telling my son recently that [part of my] primary school homework was to write a self-criticism report. The system required you to be devalued so you feel powerless. I\u2019m so happy that I can have my second life in Australia so my child doesn\u2019t have to go through what I went through.

      "body": "<p>Well, t\u2019is only right and proper that at this stage of proceedings we be left hanging. This was very much a holding episode, designed to let us draw breath after the shenanigans of last week. There\u2019s a lot brewing, but not quite coming to the boil \u2026 The prospect of a newly sane Sir Evil George bent on revenge against Ross. (You didn\u2019t really think he was going to give that up, did you?) The spectre of a wronged Tess who will do anything to get her own back on Demelza. The unresolved question of Valentine and who exactly is responsible for him. The unrequited love between Geoffrey Charles and Cecily. Plus Sam\u2019s romance with the cute, flaxen-haired one who once had a gammy leg. (Or was it scurvy?) But no one apart from Demelza really cares about that.</p> \n<p>The only moments of light relief were provided, as ever, by Horace the pug, who has started to purr like a cat for some unknown reason. If I were Horace the pug, I, too, would purr in Caroline\u2019s welcoming embrace. I enjoyed the glimpses of Sindy Doll\u2019s house which is, like Sindy Doll herself, impossibly beautiful and deserves its own Instagram account. It\u2019s worth giving a quick hat tip to Gabriella Wilde (as Caroline Enys, n\u00e9e Penvenen) who hasn\u2019t had as much to do in this series, and yet manages to convey so much in her facial expressions. Naturally, Dr Enys and his bride are still very much in love, as evidenced by them addressing each other in the third person. But things are becoming strained as she grows tired of his devotion to his work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99a2a570f5f330b0198bd21d255ca1d1e29d12c3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99a2a570f5f330b0198bd21d255ca1d1e29d12c3/0_247_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ned \u2026 a massive pain in the arse (as predicted).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ned \u2026 a massive pain in the arse (as predicted).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I thought from the start of this series that Ned was going to be a massive pain in the arse. And so it has come to pass. The business about the crown requiring Ross to make amends and become the James Bond of Nampara is finally rearing its head. And now there\u2019s a storyline about Kitty and a concealed pregnancy. (Would they have used the word \u201cmiscarriage\u201d in this era? Was it used in the original books? Never mind. Poldark is hardly the place to become exercised about historical inaccuracies.) In all the \u201cNed\u201d scenes, I find myself wishing they would just go back to France and do some more prison-breaking \u2013 or go on location to Honduras for an episode.</p> \n<p>Tensions rose between Ross and Demelza as she struggled to look upon the face of Valentine, a constant reminder \u2013 for Sir Evil George and Demelza \u2013 that Elizabeth and Ross loved each other probably more than anyone has ever loved anyone in the history of the world. (Discuss.) There was a reminder here that Ross indirectly caused Elizabeth\u2019s death by suggesting she had another child. Keen viewers will recall that there was a necessary confusion of dates with Valentine\u2019s birth, designed to reassure Sir Evil George that he was the child\u2019s father. Then, with the second pregnancy (which was definitely Sir Evil George\u2019s child), Elizabeth had to pretend she was prone to going into premature labour. This was how the evil tincture came into play. I\u2019m predicting that, at some point, it is going to come out that Dr Enys knew all about this (without sanctioning it). Let us not forget that Dr Enys is the man who knows too much.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a7da8320dd677d5461f08f01611df76bd8b507c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a7da8320dd677d5461f08f01611df76bd8b507c/0_84_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Valentine \u2026 a constant reminder.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valentine \u2026 a constant reminder.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And he knows so much that he is able to treat mental health conditions using techniques that will not be invented for many decades to come.

      "bodyText": "Well, t\u2019is only right and proper that at this stage of proceedings we be left hanging. This was very much a holding episode, designed to let us draw breath after the shenanigans of last week. There\u2019s a lot brewing, but not quite coming to the boil \u2026 The prospect of a newly sane Sir Evil George bent on revenge against Ross. (You didn\u2019t really think he was going to give that up, did you?) The spectre of a wronged Tess who will do anything to get her own back on Demelza. The unresolved question of Valentine and who exactly is responsible for him. The unrequited love between Geoffrey Charles and Cecily. Plus Sam\u2019s romance with the cute, flaxen-haired one who once had a gammy leg. (Or was it scurvy?) But no one apart from Demelza really cares about that. The only moments of light relief were provided, as ever, by Horace the pug, who has started to purr like a cat for some unknown reason. If I were Horace the pug, I, too, would purr in Caroline\u2019s welcoming embrace. I enjoyed the glimpses of Sindy Doll\u2019s house which is, like Sindy Doll herself, impossibly beautiful and deserves its own Instagram account. It\u2019s worth giving a quick hat tip to Gabriella Wilde (as Caroline Enys, n\u00e9e Penvenen) who hasn\u2019t had as much to do in this series, and yet manages to convey so much in her facial expressions. Naturally, Dr Enys and his bride are still very much in love, as evidenced by them addressing each other in the third person. But things are becoming strained as she grows tired of his devotion to his work. I thought from the start of this series that Ned was going to be a massive pain in the arse. And so it has come to pass. The business about the crown requiring Ross to make amends and become the James Bond of Nampara is finally rearing its head. And now there\u2019s a storyline about Kitty and a concealed pregnancy. (Would they have used the word \u201cmiscarriage\u201d in this era? Was it used in the original books? Never mind. Poldark is hardly the place to become exercised about historical inaccuracies.) In all the \u201cNed\u201d scenes, I find myself wishing they would just go back to France and do some more prison-breaking \u2013 or go on location to Honduras for an episode. Tensions rose between Ross and Demelza as she struggled to look upon the face of Valentine, a constant reminder \u2013 for Sir Evil George and Demelza \u2013 that Elizabeth and Ross loved each other probably more than anyone has ever loved anyone in the history of the world. (Discuss.) There was a reminder here that Ross indirectly caused Elizabeth\u2019s death by suggesting she had another child. Keen viewers will recall that there was a necessary confusion of dates with Valentine\u2019s birth, designed to reassure Sir Evil George that he was the child\u2019s father. Then, with the second pregnancy (which was definitely Sir Evil George\u2019s child), Elizabeth had to pretend she was prone to going into premature labour. This was how the evil tincture came into play. I\u2019m predicting that, at some point, it is going to come out that Dr Enys knew all about this (without sanctioning it). Let us not forget that Dr Enys is the man who knows too much. And he knows so much that he is able to treat mental health conditions using techniques that will not be invented for many decades to come. Off he went to the graveyard with Sir Evil George for some immersion therapy. Which appeared to work. \u201cThere is no fault in any of this. Loss. Yes. But no blame.\u201d Oh, Dr Enys, you are the well of compassion! \u201cAre you quite certain she died?\u201d The later scene where Dr Enys reminded Sir Evil George that not all parents are blessed with living children was heartbreaking. Meanwhile, Morwenna caught up with her child born of violation. It didn\u2019t seem like the best idea to be skulking in the bushes spying on him, but desperate times call for desperate measures. And here was Drake also spying on her. No good can come of that. And even less good can come of the Wheal Plenty rejects marching on Trenwith. I had a horrible sense of deja vu in these scenes. \u201cThere \u2019e is, the spineless worm. Let \u2019im come out and answer to us, if \u2019e dare.\u201d Heaven forbid anyone might think Poldark deserves to draw to a close as it\u2019s just repeating itself \u2026 I say that with tongue firmly in cheek as, of course, one of the great strengths of Poldark is its obsession with hubris: how blind we are to our own faults, how many times we repeat mistakes and how we foolishly repeat the same actions over and over while expecting different results.

Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor Hardly a supporting actor (although everyone must be considered a supporting actor to Ross Poldark in this business), but let us raise a sterilised bowl of leeches to the majestic Jack Farthing as Sir Evil George.

      "body": "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/the-handmaid-s-tale--episode-by-episode\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, series three</a>, on Channel 4 in the UK. Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series.</em></p> \n<p>Last week we speculated that perhaps June was bending herself to prove she couldn\u2019t snap. Well, as it turns out, she did snap, and it very nearly landed her on The Wall. But once more, she proves mysteriously immune to the punishments of Gilead, a thick layer of plot armour protecting her from the horrors the likes of Ofmatthew, Janine and Emily have suffered for similar, or lesser, \u2018crimes\u2019 against Gilead.</p> \n<p>Which isn\u2019t to say June isn\u2019t suffering. We\u2019ve seen her lose the will to live before, but we\u2019ve never seen her lose her sanity. This episode is as tractionless as her mind, scenes slipping around each other, time bleeding all over the place. Ofmatthew\u2019s stark white hospital room offers nothing for June\u2019s mind to cling on to, and the episode is a blank canvas for the splashes of colour that come in and out of June\u2019s orbit in vignettes: clusters of red handmaids and blue wives, parades of soft pink daughters, intrusions of green and black from Aunt Lydia and the doctors. The episode is essentially a series of encounters between June and whoever she can get her hands on, all designed to bring her through her dark months of the soul.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8eb060e12d8b8d572f043359614353186859a32\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8eb060e12d8b8d572f043359614353186859a32/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strangely lacking in tension ... June tries to kill Serena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Weirdly lacking in tension ... June tries to kill Serena.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Giraud/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She tries to kill Serena, in a scene weirdly lacking in tension considering how long this confrontation has been building up, and it\u2019s over almost before it starts. Serena\u2019s vitriol has again given way to sympathy, and she lets June get away with it. Far more impactful is June\u2019s conversation with Janine. Janine has always been the show\u2019s voice of insanity; as the only person capable of seeing good in Gilead, she must be crazy, right? But here it\u2019s June who\u2019s the mad one, and Janine \u2013 normally so easily manipulated in June\u2019s schemes \u2013 who stands up to June and refuses to let her kill Ofmatthew. \u201cYou\u2019re different,\u201d she tells June, pointing out her increasingly selfish behaviour. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s only when later speaking to the doctor that June realises the truth in Janine\u2019s words, and recognises her own death wish. Everything she\u2019s done since Frances was executed and Hannah was taken away has indirectly been to bring about her own death. The scene was a little heavy-handed, and June could have reached that realisation herself, rather than being told it by a convenient one-off character. But at this point, with only four episodes of the season left to go, anything that gets June back on track is, frankly, a relief. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has been treading water for the middle part of this season, and June\u2019s promise to Ofmatthew \u2013 or Natalie, as we should really call her \u2013 also acts as a promise to us that the show is ready to get back down to business.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, series three, on Channel 4 in the UK. Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series. Last week we speculated that perhaps June was bending herself to prove she couldn\u2019t snap. Well, as it turns out, she did snap, and it very nearly landed her on The Wall. But once more, she proves mysteriously immune to the punishments of Gilead, a thick layer of plot armour protecting her from the horrors the likes of Ofmatthew, Janine and Emily have suffered for similar, or lesser, \u2018crimes\u2019 against Gilead. Which isn\u2019t to say June isn\u2019t suffering. We\u2019ve seen her lose the will to live before, but we\u2019ve never seen her lose her sanity. This episode is as tractionless as her mind, scenes slipping around each other, time bleeding all over the place. Ofmatthew\u2019s stark white hospital room offers nothing for June\u2019s mind to cling on to, and the episode is a blank canvas for the splashes of colour that come in and out of June\u2019s orbit in vignettes: clusters of red handmaids and blue wives, parades of soft pink daughters, intrusions of green and black from Aunt Lydia and the doctors. The episode is essentially a series of encounters between June and whoever she can get her hands on, all designed to bring her through her dark months of the soul. She tries to kill Serena, in a scene weirdly lacking in tension considering how long this confrontation has been building up, and it\u2019s over almost before it starts. Serena\u2019s vitriol has again given way to sympathy, and she lets June get away with it. Far more impactful is June\u2019s conversation with Janine. Janine has always been the show\u2019s voice of insanity; as the only person capable of seeing good in Gilead, she must be crazy, right? But here it\u2019s June who\u2019s the mad one, and Janine \u2013 normally so easily manipulated in June\u2019s schemes \u2013 who stands up to June and refuses to let her kill Ofmatthew. \u201cYou\u2019re different,\u201d she tells June, pointing out her increasingly selfish behaviour. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d It\u2019s only when later speaking to the doctor that June realises the truth in Janine\u2019s words, and recognises her own death wish. Everything she\u2019s done since Frances was executed and Hannah was taken away has indirectly been to bring about her own death. The scene was a little heavy-handed, and June could have reached that realisation herself, rather than being told it by a convenient one-off character. But at this point, with only four episodes of the season left to go, anything that gets June back on track is, frankly, a relief. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has been treading water for the middle part of this season, and June\u2019s promise to Ofmatthew \u2013 or Natalie, as we should really call her \u2013 also acts as a promise to us that the show is ready to get back down to business. June is no longer selfishly focused on herself and her own family. Her goal is bigger now: she\u2019s going to get as many kids out as she can, because \u201cGilead should know how this feels. It\u2019s their turn to hurt.\u201d Praise be. The sound of music The episode opens with an unlikely blast of Belinda Carlisle\u2019s Heaven is a Place on Earth, which has ear-wormed its way into June\u2019s head and stays there throughout the episode, burrowing deeper and deeper into the cracks in her psyche. June is so convinced the beeps of Ofmatthew\u2019s monitors are playing the tune she even breaks the fourth wall to look us dead in the eye and tell us \u201cyou\u2019ll hear it\u201d. (Sorry, June, we didn\u2019t.) The song seems an odd choice until June sings a verse at Ofmatthew\u2019s deathbed, including the lyrics: \u2018And the world\u2019s alive with the sound of kids on the street outside.\u2019 Heaven, in her mind, is a place where children are free. Under his eye The pubescent girls undergoing fertility tests are a reminder that the upcoming generation of wives are victims just as much as the handmaids are. Their value will be defined by their fertility, and they will be sold off to husbands at an alarmingly young age. Wealth and power are no protection for women in Gilead \u2013 there is no protection. Janine\u2019s new eye patch makes her look like a \u201cspace pirate\u201d, as Aunt Lydia once again demonstrates her warped fondness for her \u2018girls\u2019. Janine\u2019s compassion is heartbreakingly wide-reaching. Yes, she is capable of seeing that Ofmatthew is \u201cone of us\u201d, and therefore as much a victim as she is, but she also loves Aunt Lydia. She\u2019s a puppy who keeps returning to the boot that kicked her. Madeline Brewer doesn\u2019t get nearly enough praise for her performance. Medicine is a \u2018miracle\u2019 only when convenient in Gilead. IVF is out of the question, but when a pregnant handmaid is left brain-damaged, suddenly God \u2018allows\u2019 doctors to perform miracles. Ah, the irrational justifications of fanaticism.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 5 August. Top stories Two mass shootings in the US have left at least 29 people dead, with Donald Trump facing strong criticism. Twenty people were killed in the majority Latino border city of El Paso, Texas, including a woman shot while trying to save her baby. Federal authorities are investigating a potential hate crime and local prosecutors have charged a 21-year-old white man with murder. Less than 13 hours later another mass shooting took place in the Dayton, Ohio, leaving nine dead there and bringing the total injured from both shootings to at least 52. Police were examining a hate-riddled message on the website 8chan, posted about 20 minutes before Saturday\u2019s Texas attack, in which the author expressed sympathy for a white nationalist massacre at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, and which stated: \u201cThis attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d By late Sunday morning, Trump had not addressed the nation in person. Leading Democrats criticised him, linking the anti-immigrant rhetoric that characterised both his 2016 campaign and his tenure as president to the potential hate crime. Providers running ParentsNext claimed more than $350,000 in extra payments last financial year to put welfare recipients through in-house training courses. The figures, revealed in a departmental response to the Senate, suggest all 22 ParentsNext providers with registered training arms went on to bill taxpayers for participants to undertake courses run by their own organisations. The $350m welfare-to-work program for disadvantaged parents faces fresh criticism. A woman with cancer has become the first person to end her life under voluntary assisted dying laws in Victoria. Kerry Robertson, 61, died at a nursing home in Bendigo on 15 July. She was the first person to be granted the permit, having visited her specialist the day legislation came into effect. Her daughters Jacqui Hicks and Nicole Robertson described her death as a \u201cbeautiful, positive experience\u201d. The sisters said it had reinforced their belief that anyone who was terminally ill and in intolerable pain deserved the choice of a voluntary assisted death. \u201cIt is the most compassionate, dignified and logical option for those suffering in the end stages of life,\u201d Nicole Robertson said. World Russia plans to tow its first floating nuclear power station to the Arctic this month in a milestone for the country\u2019s growing use of nuclear power in its northern expansion. But the station has raised safety concerns, with Greenpeace warning that it could become a \u201cfloating Chernobyl\u201d. A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a six-year-old boy was thrown from the 10th-floor viewing platform at London\u2019s Tate Modern. The child was taken to hospital by the air ambulance after being found on a fifth-floor roof and is in a critical condition. Iran claims it has seized a third foreign oil tanker in the Gulf in a further escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington and its regional allies, who continue to stare each other down over crippling economic sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. People across the Indian-administered side of Kashmir queued for hours outside petrol stations and cash machines on Sunday amid heightened security measures. A medical procedure that aims to allow women to delay the menopause for up to 20 years has been launched by IVF specialists in Britain. Doctors claim the operation could benefit thousands who experience serious health problems, such as heart conditions and bone-weakening osteoporosis, that are brought on by the menopause.

Here are the prominent cases prior to this August 2019 shooting:</p> <h2> <strong>April 2019</strong></h2> <p>1 killed in mass shooting targeting a synagogue in Poway, California, US.</p> <p>The alleged shooter, 19, from California, opened fire in a synagogue during Passover services, killing a 60-year-old woman and injuring three others. An<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/28/john-earnest-san-diego-shooting-suspect-posted-open-letter-online\"> \u201copen letter\u201d</a> posted on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/04/mass-shootings-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio-8chan-far-right-website\">8chan</a> extremist message board before the attack included white nationalist conspiracy rhetoric and said the shooter was inspired by the gunman who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christchurch-shooting\">opened fire on Muslims</a> at two mosques in New Zealand the month before.</p> <h2>March 2019</h2> <p>51 killed in mass shootings targeting two mosques in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christchurch-shooting\">Christchurch, New Zealand</a>.</p> <p>The alleged shooter, a 28-year-old white man from Australia, posted on 8chan before the attack, and then live-streamed himself shooting unarmed people in and around two Christchurch mosques. The manifesto posted before the shooting paid tribute to previous white nationalist attacks, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/anders-behring-breivik\">Anders Breivik</a>\u2019s 2011 bomb and shooting attack in Norway, as well as historic acts of violence against Muslims. </p> <h2>October 2018</h2> <p>11 killed in a mass shooting targeting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/27/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-antisemitism-conspiracy-theories\">Tree of Life synagogue</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US.</p> <p>The alleged shooter, a 46-year-old white man, reportedly shouted \u201cAll Jews must die!\u201d during the attack. After he was taken into custody, he told a law enforcement official that he believed Jews \u201cwere committing a genocide to his people\u201d, a central white nationalist conspiracy theory. The gunman, who is awaiting trial and has pleaded not guilty, apparently had an active profile on an extremist social media site, where he accused Jewish people of trying to bring \u201cevil\u201d Muslims into the US, and wrote that a refugee aid organisation \u201clikes to bring invaders in that kill our people\u201d. </p> <h2>October 2018</h2> <p>Man attempted to enter black church before allegedly killing two black people in a supermarket in Kentucky, US.</p> <p>A witness said that during the attack, the alleged shooter said: \u201cWhites don\u2019t kill whites.\u201d His two victims, Maurice Stallard, 69, and Vickie Lee Jones, 67, were both black. Shortly before the shooting he had attempted to enter a nearby, predominantly black church, which was locked. The suspect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/15/kroger-shooting-gregory-bush-charged\">was charged</a> with hate crimes.</p> <h2>August 2017</h2> <p>Heather Heyer was killed and dozens injured after a car ploughed into anti-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, US.</p> <p>After authorities shut down a violent white supremacist and neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, one of the men who had been photographed with a white supremacist group drove his car into a crowded street full of counter-protesters. Heather Heyer, 32, who was there protesting the far-right supporters, was killed. Dozens more were injured, many seriously. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/11/james-fields-charlottesville-trial-sentence-jury-recommends-life-heather-heyer\">The killer</a> had been obsessed with Hitler as a teenager, according to a former teacher. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/28/charlottesville-james-fields-life-sentence-heather-heyer-car-attack\">sentenced</a> to life in prison.</p> <h2>June 2017</h2> <p>A man called Makram Ali was killed and 12 people injured after a van <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/finsbury-park-van-attack\">ploughed into worshippers</a> outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, United Kingdom.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/02/finsbury-park-attack-darren-osborne-jailed\">The killer, </a>who has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/02/finsbury-park-attack-darren-osborne-jailed\">jailed for life</a>, shouted: \u201cI want to kill all Muslims \u2013 I did my bit,\u201d after the van attack, according to witnesses. He had been radicalised online and over Twitter, a judge concluded, and avidly consumed anti-Muslim propaganda from prominent rightwing figures.<br></p> <h2>May 2017</h2> <p>Two men stabbed to death after intervening in an anti-Muslim rant, Portland, Oregon, US.</p> <p>Two men were killed and one injured after they tried to intervene to protect young women on a public train who were being targeted with an anti-Muslim tirade. Their alleged killer shouted \u201cFree speech or die\u201d later in a courtroom, and \u201cDeath to Antifa! You call it terrorism, I call it patriotism!\u201d The suspect is <a href=\"https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2019/03/22/attorneys-for-alleged-max-stabber-jeremy-christian-ask-to-move-his-murder-trial-out-of-portland/\">awaiting</a> trial.</p> <h2>March 2017</h2> <p>Timothy Caughman stalked and killed by a white supremacist with a sword, New York, US.</p> <p>The alleged killer later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/23/james-jackson-racist-new-york-attack-black-man-plot\">pleaded guilty</a> and was sentenced to life behind bars.</p> <p>Caughman, a 66-year-old \u201ccan and bottle recycler\u201d, had lively social media accounts full of photographs with celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey. His killer, an American military veteran, said he targeted a random black man on the street in New York City as a \u201cpractice run\u201d for a bigger attack. <br></p> <h2>January 2017</h2> <p>Six people killed during evening prayers at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada.</p> <p>One of the victims, Azzeddine Soufiane, was killed as he attempted to tackle the gunman. Nineteen people were also injured in the shooting, which the convicted gunman said was prompted<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/canada-mosque-shooter-alexandre-bissonnette-trudeau-trump-refugees-travel-ban\"> by Justin Trudeau\u2019s tweet</a> that refugees were welcome in Canada, and that \u201cdiversity is strength\u201d. Those comments from the Canadian prime minster followed US president Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trumps-travel-ban\">travel ban</a> on people from several Muslim-majority countries. The shooter, who said he feared refugees would kill his family, had previously been known as an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/world/canada/quebec-mosque-attack-alexandre-bissonnette.html\">aggressive online troll</a> .<br></p> <h2>June 2016</h2> <p>Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jo-cox\">Jo Cox</a> shot and stabbed to death, UK.</p> <p>Cox was a supporter of Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">staying</a> in the European Union.

The man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/thomas-mair-found-guilty-of-jo-cox-murder\">convicted of killing her</a> was a white supremacist obsessed with the Nazis and apartheid-era South Africa.

      "bodyText": "In the past eight years, more than 175 people around the world have been killed in at least 16 high-profile attacks motivated, or apparently motivated, by white nationalist conspiracy theories, including the far-right racist belief that nonwhite immigrants and refugees are \u201cinvaders\u201d who pose an existential threat to the white race. The targets of deadly attacks have included Muslim worshippers at mosques in Canada, Britain and New Zealand; black Americans in church, including during Bible study at a historic black church in South Carolina; Jewish Americans in synagogues across the United States; and leftwing politicians and activists in the US, UK, Greece and Norway. Now, law enforcement officials in the United States are investigating two more mass shootings with potential links to white nationalist radicalization. An attack on Saturday at a Walmart superstore in El Paso, Texas, a majority-Hispanic city, which left 22 people dead and more than two dozen wounded, and a shooting the previous weekend at a garlic festival in Gilroy, California, packed with families with young children, which left three people dead and 15 wounded. Many of the white male perpetrators or suspects in these attacks have explicitly described immigrants and refugees as \u201cinvaders\u201d or an \u201cinvasion\u201d online, and have cited previous white nationalist killers as the inspiration for their attacks. Several of these deadly attacks have also been closely linked to mainstream political debates over refugees and immigration. Here are the prominent cases prior to this August 2019 shooting: April 2019 1 killed in mass shooting targeting a synagogue in Poway, California, US. The alleged shooter, 19, from California, opened fire in a synagogue during Passover services, killing a 60-year-old woman and injuring three others. An \u201copen letter\u201d posted on the 8chan extremist message board before the attack included white nationalist conspiracy rhetoric and said the shooter was inspired by the gunman who had opened fire on Muslims at two mosques in New Zealand the month before. March 2019 51 killed in mass shootings targeting two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The alleged shooter, a 28-year-old white man from Australia, posted on 8chan before the attack, and then live-streamed himself shooting unarmed people in and around two Christchurch mosques. The manifesto posted before the shooting paid tribute to previous white nationalist attacks, including Anders Breivik\u2019s 2011 bomb and shooting attack in Norway, as well as historic acts of violence against Muslims. October 2018 11 killed in a mass shooting targeting the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US. The alleged shooter, a 46-year-old white man, reportedly shouted \u201cAll Jews must die!\u201d during the attack. After he was taken into custody, he told a law enforcement official that he believed Jews \u201cwere committing a genocide to his people\u201d, a central white nationalist conspiracy theory. The gunman, who is awaiting trial and has pleaded not guilty, apparently had an active profile on an extremist social media site, where he accused Jewish people of trying to bring \u201cevil\u201d Muslims into the US, and wrote that a refugee aid organisation \u201clikes to bring invaders in that kill our people\u201d. October 2018 Man attempted to enter black church before allegedly killing two black people in a supermarket in Kentucky, US. A witness said that during the attack, the alleged shooter said: \u201cWhites don\u2019t kill whites.\u201d His two victims, Maurice Stallard, 69, and Vickie Lee Jones, 67, were both black. Shortly before the shooting he had attempted to enter a nearby, predominantly black church, which was locked. The suspect was charged with hate crimes. August 2017 Heather Heyer was killed and dozens injured after a car ploughed into anti-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, US. After authorities shut down a violent white supremacist and neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, one of the men who had been photographed with a white supremacist group drove his car into a crowded street full of counter-protesters. Heather Heyer, 32, who was there protesting the far-right supporters, was killed. Dozens more were injured, many seriously. The killer had been obsessed with Hitler as a teenager, according to a former teacher. He was sentenced to life in prison. June 2017 A man called Makram Ali was killed and 12 people injured after a van ploughed into worshippers outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, United Kingdom. The killer, who has been jailed for life, shouted: \u201cI want to kill all Muslims \u2013 I did my bit,\u201d after the van attack, according to witnesses. He had been radicalised online and over Twitter, a judge concluded, and avidly consumed anti-Muslim propaganda from prominent rightwing figures. May 2017 Two men stabbed to death after intervening in an anti-Muslim rant, Portland, Oregon, US. Two men were killed and one injured after they tried to intervene to protect young women on a public train who were being targeted with an anti-Muslim tirade. Their alleged killer shouted \u201cFree speech or die\u201d later in a courtroom, and \u201cDeath to Antifa! You call it terrorism, I call it patriotism!\u201d The suspect is awaiting trial. March 2017 Timothy Caughman stalked and killed by a white supremacist with a sword, New York, US. The alleged killer later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life behind bars. Caughman, a 66-year-old \u201ccan and bottle recycler\u201d, had lively social media accounts full of photographs with celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey. His killer, an American military veteran, said he targeted a random black man on the street in New York City as a \u201cpractice run\u201d for a bigger attack. January 2017 Six people killed during evening prayers at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada. One of the victims, Azzeddine Soufiane, was killed as he attempted to tackle the gunman. Nineteen people were also injured in the shooting, which the convicted gunman said was prompted by Justin Trudeau\u2019s tweet that refugees were welcome in Canada, and that \u201cdiversity is strength\u201d. Those comments from the Canadian prime minster followed US president Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries. The shooter, who said he feared refugees would kill his family, had previously been known as an aggressive online troll . June 2016 Labour MP Jo Cox shot and stabbed to death, UK. Cox was a supporter of Britain staying in the European Union. She was attacked a week before the EU referendum vote in 2016. The man convicted of killing her was a white supremacist obsessed with the Nazis and apartheid-era South Africa. He shouted: \u201cThis is for Britain,\u201d \u201cKeep Britain independent\u201d and \u201cBritain first\u201d as he killed her. October 2015 Three killed in attack on school in Trollh\u00e4ttan, Sweden. The attacker targeted a local high school with a high percentage of immigrant students. Police said students and teacherswith darker skinwere targeted. Three died, including 15-year-old Ahmed Hassan, who was born in Somalia and had recently moved to Sweden. June 2015 Nine people killed during Bible study at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, US. The nine victims included elderly longtime church members at the Mother Emanuel AME church, and Clementa Pinckney, a state senator. The shooter, a self-avowed white supremacist, said he wanted to start a race war, and that he was concerned about \u201cblack-on-white crime\u201d. He has been convicted of murder and hate crimes. April 2014 Three killed at Jewish centre and retirement home in Overland Park, Kansas, US. A former Ku Klux Klan leader shot and killed three people, one of them just 14 years old. He was later convicted of murder. He said he believed Jews were destroying the white race, and that diversity was a kind of genocide. None of his victims were Jewish, but he said he considered two of them to be accomplices to Jewish people. September 2013 Rapper and anti-fascist activist Pavlos Fyssas stabbed to death in Piraeus, Greece. A senior member of Greece\u2019s neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party was imprisoned after confessing to the killing. August 2012 Six worshippers killed in a shooting targeting a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The dead included the temple president, Satwant Singh Kaleka. The shooter, a \u201cfrustrated neo-Nazi\u201d who had played in white power bands, was a regular on racist websites, and died in the attack. He had previously talked to one colleague in the US military about a \u201cracial holy war that was coming\u201d and told another he was a \u201crace traitor\u201d for dating a Latina woman. July 2011 77 people killed in attacks on Ut\u00f8ya island and in Oslo, Norway. A bomb attack, followed by a shooting that targeted the island summer youth camp of Norway\u2019s Labor party. The shooter, who was convicted and is in prison, wanted to prevent an \u201cinvasion of Muslims\u201d and deliberately targeted politically active young people who he saw as \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d and proponents of multiculturalism. More than half of the dead were teenagers.",

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola said he expects Manchester United to be serious challengers for this season\u2019s Premier League title once they complete the signing of Harry Maguire. Guardiola was speaking after seeing his side edge past Liverpool in the Community Shield, winning on penalties after a 1-1 draw. It was an intense clash between the teams who vied for the title last season but Guardiola said he can see other sides, particularly United, joining the fight this term after they outbid City for the centre-back and are set to sign him from Leicester for \u00a385m, a world-record fee for a defender. \u201cMaguire is an excellent, top-class player,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe were interested but we could not afford him. United could afford him. He\u2019s strong in the air, good with the ball, he can drive with the ball and he\u2019s so fast. He has a lot of qualities, so congratulations to United.\u201d The City manager suggested that with United\u2019s defence bolstered by Maguire and the \u00a350m right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, City have a real fight on their hands as they aim for a third consecutive title. \u201cPeople say we are going to win [the title] again but I don\u2019t care,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will be like last season with only two challengers, I think there will be many more. There are five or six teams who are contenders, then after the competition will talk. For United, it doesn\u2019t matter what has happened in the last four or five years, they always start as contenders. They will go higher with the players they have bought. And Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham [will also challenge].\u201d Guardiola has no doubt Liverpool again pose a big threat to his team. The team traded blows in an entertaining Community Shield encounter, Raheem Sterling opening the scoring for City before Jo\u00ebl Matip equalised for Liverpool, who came close to winning in normal time before City prevailed 5-4 in the shootout. Claudio Bravo saved the Reds\u2019 second penalty, from Giorginio Wijnaldum, to pave the road to victory for the club that won the same showpiece last season before going on to lift the three main domestic trophies. \u201cYou have to give a lot of credit for this victory,\u201d he said. \u201cLiverpool are the champions of Europe and a top\u2011class team. The difference [last season] was one point ahead, now it\u2019s one penalty ahead. That is the difference.\u201d Describing the game as \u201ctremendously demanding\u201d, Guardiola admitted: \u201cLiverpool were better than us in the last 20 minutes \u2013 but we scored one penalty more.\u201d Confusion surrounded the absence of Riyad Mahrez from the City squad, with Guardiola suggesting the winger, who won the Africa Cup of Nations with Algeria on 18 July, initially declared himself available but was left out after treatment for a minor illness before returning to England on Friday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what he took for medicine and that is why for doping control there was a risk because the doctors didn\u2019t have it,\u201d Guardiola said.

      "bodyText": "Stef Smith wrote a fascinating dystopian drama in Human Animals which showed cities of the future plagued by animal infestation. If her latest play also depicts a world trembling on the brink of change, it is altogether more positive in that it suggests women are ready to cast off their competitive singularity to become a collective force. But, while the message is upbeat, it is one of those plays where patterned, poetic writing takes precedence over actual drama. Smith\u2019s two characters are female flight attendants. Often seen as stock farcical properties in plays like Boeing-Boeing, here they are long-term friends who offer soothing reassurance in the air but whose lives on the ground are unravelling. The domesticated Jane has a house \u2013 and possibly a marriage \u2013 threatened with subsidence, while the single Toni is in a relationship with an abusive boyfriend. They both, however, find consolation not just in each other but in the idea that women are rejecting male classification and raising themselves up out of the earth. The two characters echo each other\u2019s rhythms, engage in constant alliteration (\u201cthey stare at skylines that shine in the sun\u201d) and at times sound like feminised versions of Beckett\u2019s Didi and Gogo. But Waiting for Godot seems like a riot of incident compared to Smith\u2019s play in which events are more often described than happening before our eyes. Bryony Shanahan, incoming joint director of Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange, provides a physical momentum absent in the text and the two actors are skilful and well contrasted: Amanda Wright as Toni conveys a rootless insecurity while Louise Ludgate as Jane suggests someone entrapped by family life. But Smith\u2019s whole point, even if her play is dramatically undernourished, is that when they work in unison women make an unstoppable force. \u2022 At Traverse, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews",

      "bodyText": "Nine people have been killed in Ohio and at least 26 injured in the second mass shooting in the US in less than 24 hours. Police said the suspect opened fire in the Oregon district of the city of Dayton at 1am (6am BST) on Sunday, before being shot and killed by responding officers. At a news conference on Sunday afternoon the Dayton police deputy chief, Matt Carper, named the lone gunman as 24-year-old Connor Betts. Carper listed the names of the victims, which included the gunman\u2019s younger sister, 22-year-old Megan Betts. The victims ranged in age from 22 to 57 and all were killed in the same vicinity. Authorities were expected to provide further details on the shooting later on Sunday afternoon. The mayor of Dayton, Nan Whaley, said the gunman was wearing body armour. He used a 223-calibre rifle magazine and had additional high-capacity magazines with him. Whaley said the injured had been taken to a number of hospitals and that some had life-threatening wounds. She added uniformed officers were in the area when the suspect started shooting. \u201cIn less than one minute, Dayton first responders neutralised the shooter. While this is a terribly sad day for our city, I am amazed by the quick response of Dayton police. They saved literally hundreds of lives.\u201d She said: \u201cAs a mayor this is a day that we all dread happening and certainly what\u2019s very sad is \u2026 that so many of us have gone through it.\u201d Video from the scene near downtown Dayton showed a number of emergency vehicles on a street that had been cordoned off. The FBI was assisting with the investigation and a family assistance centre had been set up at the Dayton Convention Center. Carper called on those with information about the incident to contact police. The Oregon district is a historic neighbourhood near downtown Dayton, home to bars, restaurants and theatres. Carper said officers routinely patrolled the area, which was popular with visitors, and described it as \u201ca safe part of downtown\u201d. \u201cWe are very fortunate that the officers were in close proximity and that they reacted in the way that they did,\u201d Carper said at an earlier news conference. \u201cAs bad as this is, it could have been much, much worse as I think everyone will become aware of here as more information unfolds. So we\u2019re very appreciative of the officers who were on scene and the action that they took. \u201cThis is obviously a very difficult situation. They put themselves in harm\u2019s way. That\u2019s what they are here for \u2013 to protect the public \u2013 and that\u2019s what they did tonight.\u201d The official later read out the names of each victim, one by one. He listed: Lois Oglesby a 27-year-old woman, Saeed Saleh, a 38-year-old man, Derrick Fudge, a 57-year-old man, Logan Turner, a 30-year-old man, Nicholas Cumer, a 25-year-old man, Thomas McNichols, a 25-year-old man, Beatrice Warren-Curtis, a 36-year-old woman, and Monica Brickhouse, a 39-year-old woman, along side Megan Betts, the shooter\u2019s sister as those killed during the attack. The Ohio shooting came hours after a young man allegedly opened fire in a crowded shopping area in El Paso, Texas, leaving 20 dead and more than two dozen injured. Days before, on 28 July, a 19-year-old shot and killed three people, including two children, at the Gilroy garlic festival in northern California. The shooting in Ohio marked the 31st deadly mass shooting in America this year, defined as those where at least three people are killed by gun violence in a single episode. Mike DeWine, the Ohio governor, tweeted that he was heartbroken by the attack. He commended Dayton police and other first responders for \u201ctheir bravery and quick response to save lives and bring an end to this tragedy\u201d. \u201cI have ordered that flags in Ohio remain at half-mast in honour and memory of the victims who lost their lives this morning,\u201d he said. Nikita Papillon, 23, was across the street at Newcom\u2019s Tavern when the shooting started. She said she had seen a girl she had talked to earlier lying outside Ned Peppers Bar, near where the shooting took place. \u201cShe had told me she liked my outfit and thought I was cute, and I told her I liked her outfit and I thought she was cute,\u201d Papillon said. She had been to Ned Peppers the night before, describing it as the kind of place \u201cwhere you don\u2019t have to worry about someone shooting up the place\u201d. \u201cPeople my age, we don\u2019t think something like this is going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when it happens, words can\u2019t describe it.\u201d Tianycia Leonard, 28, was in the back, smoking, at Newcom\u2019s. She heard \u201cloud thumps\u201d that she initially thought was someone pounding on a dumpster. \u201cIt was so noisy, but then you could tell it was gunshots and there was a lot of rounds,\u201d Leonard said. Donald Trump was briefed on the shooting and praised law enforcement\u2019s speedy response in a tweet on Sunday. The Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Former Blue Peter presenter and wife of Black Mirror\u2019s creator, Konnie Huq, has said her family had to switch off their Amazon virtual assistant after their son accidentally called her husband, Charlie Brooker, by the name of the device, Alexa, instead of Daddy. Brooker\u2019s series explores the dystopian consequences and moral dilemmas of an increasingly tech-dependent society. From a simulated reality that allows people to live on after death to autonomous drone insects capable of instant murder, there is hardly a futuristic technological scenario that Brooker hasn\u2019t envisioned in his award-winning series. Speaking to the Sunday Times Magazine, Huq said: \u201cWe did have Alexa, but we switched her off. One day our son came in and said: \u2018Alexa \u2013 I mean Daddy,\u2019 and it was oh, my goodness!\u201d Brooker and Huq aren\u2019t the first parents to restrict the use of IoT (Internet of Things) devices in their household; opinions on how children should engage with the digital world have been divided for many years, with studies showing that children spend twice as long on smartphones as talking to parents alarming many. Fears that technology is replacing human interaction in young people\u2019s lives were recently fuelled by the Royal College of Psychiatrists\u2019 international congress, where addiction to the online game Fortnite was described as a real disorder. But some researchers are calling these fears misplaced, arguing that these are not facts so much as scaremongering. In July, a British teenager whose obsession with video games caused years of arguments with his family, won almost \u00a31m after finishing second in the popular Fortnite World Cup. The news came just three months after Prince Harry called for the game to be banned, calling it \u201cirresponsible\u201d and questioning whether it can benefit any household. The impact of technology on children\u2019s lives remains disputed but at least Brooker may have been provided with easy inspiration for Black Mirror\u2019s next season.",

Greater Manchester police said there was the potential for the situation at the reservoir to affect Marple, but stressed there were no plans to evacuate the town and said advice was being given out as a precaution. A further 55 homes in the Horwich End area of the town were cleared on Saturday evening, two days after 1,500 residents left. Derbyshire police allowed one person from each of the 400 properties evacuated on Thursday to return for a 15-minute visit on Saturday to pick up pets and other essentials. Barry Rudd, who is a volunteer for the Canal and River Trust, said it had been a tense night waiting to see whether the dam wall would give way flooding the area. Rudd, who has kept almost 4,000 local residents updated on the Whaley Bridge Facebook group, was one of the first on the scene when the dam wall was breached. He said: \u201cThere is a considerable amount of water that has been pumped out but they are expecting rain this evening so nobody can guess what is going to happen. There is still a 50% chance it might breach. \u201cIt was tense. My van is laden with gear because we didn\u2019t know what we would need if the dam burst and there was a rescue or clean-up operation. We are just waiting and waiting now.\u201d",

Not when you go to bed on Saturday night mourning the victims of a massacre in a Walmart in the border city of El Paso. Not when you wake on Sunday morning to learn of mass murder in the seemingly safe downtown streets of Dayton, Ohio. In his 2017 inaugural address, Donald Trump railed against \u201ccrime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives\u201d in the inner cities. Then Trump declared, in words that now echo with bitter irony, \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\u201d There is no way to know with absolute certainty how much of the current wave of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d is directly due to Trump\u2019s own words and his embrace of white nationalist themes.

      "bodyText": "So after four magical days at Woburn, a fantastic Women\u2019s British Open comes to a close. Hinako Shibuno lands a major at the very first time of asking. It bears repeating that she\u2019s never played on the LPGA Tour before, nor even out of Japan. She\u2019s a sensation. Commiserations to Lizette Salas, who came so close to a maiden major victory herself. Congratulations to Atthaya Thitikul, who won the Smyth Salver as low amateur ... and of course to the Smiling Cinderella, for a fairytale that will still be told many years from now. Thanks for reading! -18: Shibuno -17: Salas -16: JY Ko -15: Pressel -14: Buhai -12: Boutier -11: Ciganda -10: SH Park -9: N Korda, Lee6 It\u2019s worth noting that Shibuno didn\u2019t realise Woburn wasn\u2019t a links course until she turned up this week. She had assumed the Women\u2019s British Open, like its male counterpart, would take place at the seaside. In completely unrelated news, the man in the blue wig below, waving Nibbles the Comedy Duck in the air, is her manager. Shibuno talks to Sky through her interpreter. \u201cI\u2019m nervous even though I\u2019ve won. I still feel like I\u2019m going to vomit! I was nervous on the front nine, but on the back nine I was OK. I produced a lot of birdies. At the end I thought I was going to try but the tears didn\u2019t come out. Obviously contending at a tournament like this is nerve-wracking, but I also felt that I was going to enjoy this moment as well. There were many Japanese spectators out there, and I heard them speak Japanese, so I felt like I was playing in Japan! Thank you!\u201d \u201cWith a score of 270, the AIG Women\u2019s British Open champion is Hinako Shibuno!\u201d Huge cheers as the champion golfer takes to the stage, trotting across the green to claim her prize in much the same endearing manner she jogs off to pick up her divots. Then, clearly not fluent in English, nevertheless makes a great fist of carefully reading out a thank-you speech. It\u2019s beyond charming. She breaks down in giggles as she struggles to phonetically decode some nice words about the greenkeeping staff. Then she pauses dramatically after thanking the spectators. A final \u201cthank you!\u201d gets a huge laugh and the warmest round of applause. She is such an infectious character. A star is born! But this is all about Hinako Shibuno, who came to this tournament as an unknown, and walks away a star! She could have crumbled after carelessly four-putting the 3rd green. However she dug in and for the second day in a row, battled through a sticky patch before ripping up the back nine. She played it in 31 shots today. She played it in 30 yesterday and on Thursday. She\u2019s played the back nine in -18 this week! Which coincidentally is the total she finished with. Golf: a game of two halves, huh? -18: Shibuno -17: Salas -16: JY Ko -15: Pressel -14: Buhai -12: Boutier -11: Ciganda -10: SH Park -9: N Korda, Lee6 Par for Ashleigh Buhai, who ends the week with a decent 70. She ends in fifth spot at -14, and despite her crushing disappointment warmly embraces the new champion. Wild scenes on the 18th as the 20-year-old Japanese debutant cavorts in glee, smiling the widest smile. But spare a thought for poor Lizette Salas, who shot a carpe-diem 65 today, her final birdie effort lipping out from four feet. You can see the world crumbling in her eyes as she\u2019s informed of Shibuno\u2019s birdie. It will hurt for a long time. But hers was a brilliant performance too. Second spot, her best finish at a major, and if it wasn\u2019t for her, this final round wouldn\u2019t have been the hugely entertaining rollercoaster it was. Hopefully her day is still to come. HINAKO SHIBUNO WINS THE 2019 BRITISH OPEN! She rattles her putt straight at the hole. She\u2019s not going to die wondering! Had it not hit the cup, that might have gone quite a long way past. But her ball smacks into the hole, jumps up a little, and then dunks into the hole. She\u2019s won on her major-championship debut! On her LPGA Tour debut! On her first competitive outing outside Japan! This is a story for the ages! Smiling Cinderella will go to the ball! -18: Shibuno -17: Salas Hinako Shibuno strides up the fairway, basking in the applause, soaking up the love. She bows graciously in all directions. Meanwhile on the putting green, Lizette Salas keeps herself warmed up in a slightly agitated fashion. She must be in turmoil right now. Shibuno steps up, and ... Buhai also looks exceptionally dejected, but she arrows her second into 18 to 12 feet nevertheless. Then it\u2019s all down to Shibuno, who whips her approach straight at the flag, and smiles broadly, infectiously, as it travels towards the green. Her ball lands 15 feet shy of the hole. She\u2019ll have that for birdie, and the 2019 British Open championship! A disappointed Pressel lets her six-foot par putt slide by the right of the cup. That\u2019ll cost her a few pennies. A bogey. She shot 66-67 over the weekend, and after a long period in the doldrums, the 2007 ANA Inspiration winner is back competing at the top table. She\u2019s -15. Bogey for Park Sung-hyun too. She takes a ludicrous amount of time over a short par effort, to no benefit whatsoever. She ends with at 73, another no-show on a Sunday. She\u2019s -10. Park having taken so long over that putt, I wonder how nervous Shibuno is getting back down the fairway?! Salas fought hard to hold back the tears upon missing that putt. She knows how costly it could be. Especially as Shibuno has just creamed her drive down the last. Further up the hole, Pressel sent her second into 18, only to see it bound off the green and into the bunker back left. She can\u2019t hole out, and her race is run. What a tilt she took at the prize, though. ... and misses it! It lips out on the right, and it\u2019s just a par to finish. She smacks her lips in frustration, knowing that the miss could have cost her this tournament. A birdie would have put her one clear at the top; as it is, it\u2019s still a 65, and she\u2019s got a share. That\u2019s kept Morgan Pressel in with a shout. And Hinako Shibuno will have a chance to steal it at the last, because she\u2019s just very nearly birdied 17 from the fringe, her putt stopping just to the left of the cup. Par, and if she birdies 18 for the third time this week, she\u2019ll be the British Open champion! -17: Salas (F), Shibuno (17) -16: JY Ko (F), Pressel (17) -14: Buhai (17) And so up to the 18th green. Ko Jin-young is on in regulation. But she\u2019s a long way from the hole. She very nearly drains a 40-foot left-to-right curler over a ridge and into the cup. But it\u2019s one turn short. The ANA Inspiration and Evian champion signs for a blemish-free 66. It\u2019s not enough, though. No treble in the majors this year. Then Lizette Salas steps up to take her birdie putt ... Morgan Pressell keeps her hopes alive with a scarcely believable up-and-down from thick rough to the left of 17. She remains at -16. It won\u2019t be enough if Salas makes her birdie putt on 18, but right now, she\u2019s still in the mix. Hinako Shibuno very nearly bundles in her chip from the back of 16. It slips 18 inches past, and that\u2019s a par. She remains in a share of the lead at -17 with Lizette Salas. Ashleigh Buhai can\u2019t rake in her long par putt, and at -14 her chances are realistically gone. Especially because up on 18, Salas eases a world-class iron straight at the flag, her ball rolling softly towards the cup and stopping four feet shy. She\u2019ll have that for birdie, a 64, and sole ownership of the lead at the business end of this tournament! \u201cJesus, Morgan!\u201d That\u2019s Pressel\u2019s response to pulling her tee shot at 17 into the thick rough on the left. Buhai\u2019s internal monologue will no doubt be mining similar themes, as she gives up on her chip coming into 16. She reaches the green, but she\u2019ll have a long, long putt for par. Meanwhile Salas splits 18 with a splendid drive. The world number one Ko follows her down the track. Ko makes her par saver. That was an amazing scramble. Salas lags up from distance to save her par as well. Back on 16, Pressel knocks her second to six feet and makes birdie, simply refusing to go away. But a little bit of trouble afoot for Buhai, who might be dropping out of contention soon. She hits a tree down the right of 16 with her drive, then sends her second into rough on the other side of the hole. Shibuno - who stopped to munch some sweeties and share a laugh with a TV cameraman, giggling down the lens - fires her second over the flag and just off the back of the green. Not too far from the flag, it wouldn\u2019t be a difficult up and down in normal circumstances. These aren\u2019t normal circumstances. -17: Salas (17), Shibuno (15) -16: JY Ko (17), Pressel (16) -15: Buhai (15) Ko flips a sensational wedge out of the sand to six feet. Never mind the delicate skill, that took such nerve from there. Another monster drive by Shibuno, who batters her ball down the 16th. And up on 18, Charley Hull signs for a dismal 76 - she\u2019s -5 - while Carlota Ciganda again plays the hole in farcical style. Yesterday she sent a huge slice into the bushes down the right, tried to play a ball that was never coming out, and ran up a double bogey. Today she sends a massive hook into the trees on the left, then sends her second into the hospitality suites on the right! A free drop, and she gets up and down for a par of the most amusing lunacy. A 70 today, and at -11 it\u2019s another great showing in the majors. Salas finds the green at the par-three 17th, but she\u2019ll have a long two putts for par. Ko sends her tee shot into the sand on the right. She\u2019s shortsided on a downslope. That\u2019s going to be quite a poser. And if the pressure of scrambling par on the 71st hole of a major championship isn\u2019t enough already, Shibuno sends two big shots straight down the par-five 15th, wedges to six feet, and rolls in the birdie putt to join Salas at -17! Salas lines up her birdie putt expecting some right-to-left break. It doesn\u2019t move. But that\u2019s a par and she\u2019s one hole closer to home. Ko can\u2019t make her shorter birdie putt, prodding tentatively at her effort, which dribbles apologetically to the right. Meanwhile up on 18, a miserable end to a miserable day for Bronte Law. No bogeys for three days, then five on the outward nine this afternoon. A three-putt to close, and it\u2019s a 78 that will take a little while to get over. Still, remember: it\u2019s her rookie year on tour, and this experience, however painful, should stand her in good stead down the line. She ends the week at -3. -17: Salas (16) -16: JY Ko (16), Shibuno (14) -15: Pressel (15), Buhai (14) Salas and Ko send wonderfully controlled approaches into 16. Birdie attempts coming up. Back on 15, Pressel doesn\u2019t really put the foot on the gas, seemingly happy to make a conservative, no-risk par. In the circumstances, is that enough? Fuss-free pars for Shibuno and Buhai at the par-three 14th. Up on 15, Pressel launches a drive down the right of the track. And on 16, Salas and Ko crash gorgeous drives straight down the middle. Nobody\u2019s giving an inch! -17: Salas (15) -16: JY Ko (15), Shibuno (14) -15: Pressel (14), Buhai (13) -12: Boutier (F) A 71 in the end for Jeongeun Lee6. Having gone out in 32, she came back in 39. That miscalculation off the tee at the short par-four 12th killed her bid stone dead. She eds the week at -9. Meanwhile it\u2019s just par for Ko on 15 ... but Lizette Salas sets her birdie putt off on the perfect line and at the perfect pace, the ball curling right to left the second it reaches the cup! Birdie, and she\u2019s in the lead on her own again at -17! Ko Jin-young looks like she might be the one to blink first. She pulls her second at the par-five 15th into a bunker 80 yards from the green. On Sky, Jamie Spence suggests she\u2019ll do extremely well to simply find the putting surface from there. So of course she clips the long bunker shot to 20 feet. Quite the result. Salas will have a 20-foot birdie chance too, having played the hole in much less stressful a fashion. But Sung-hyun Park may be on edge. While Morgan Pressel was making birdie, she was three-putting. And taking her sweet time about it, too. Her group has been put on the clock as a result of the world number two\u2019s slow play. Hinako Shibuno joins the leaders by making her birdie putt! Nothing more than the second shot deserved. She walks off shining with happiness. She\u2019s threatening to tear up the back nine at Woburn yet again! Ashleigh Buhai has a tricky little downhill dribbler, but she guides in her birdie too. Just as well, because the sheer quality of that approach-cum-escape rendered a par simply unacceptable. And it doesn\u2019t stop, because Morgan Pressel rolls in a straight 20-footer for birdie on 14! This is becoming outrageously exciting. -16: JY Ko (14), Salas (14), Shibuno (13) -15: Pressel (14), Buhai (13) It\u2019s been 262 starts since Morgan Pressel last won a tournament. An 11-year-wait could come to an end today on the biggest stage. She curls in a 25-foot right-to-left birdie effort on 13 to move to -14. Coming up behind, the final pairing of Shibuno and Buhai pepper the flag. Buhai\u2019s second in particular, after a poor tee shot, is magical, a high draw around trees on the left to six feet. Just outstanding. Shibuno\u2019s elegant arrow to 12 feet looks positively bog-standard by comparison. Ko\u2019s birdie effort on 14 is never going in. A couple of feet past, but she calmly pars. The one Salas trickles down the green looks like dropping, though, before turning off to the left at the last. She throws her head back in despair. So close to taking the outright lead again! The winner is coming from this little group. But who will it be? We might need a sudden-death play-off to find out! -16: JY Ko (14), Salas (14) -15: Shibuno (12) -14: Buhai (12) -13: Pressel (12) -12: Boutier (F), SH Park (12) The standard of golf here is off the scale! Ko claps her tee shot at 14 to 12 feet, so Salas responds by sending hers to 10! Shibuno nearly makes her eagle putt, but the ball dies to the right at the last. A birdie will suffice, though, and her smile\u2019s back as she closes on the leaders; she\u2019s -15. And birdie for Buhai, who didn\u2019t go for the green but wedged her second to three feet and cleaned up from there. This is a magnificent tournament. Hinako Shibuno decides to go for it on 12. Straight for the pin, as well, leaving no margin for error. The Smiling Cinderella looks slightly concerned as her ball begins to descend as it crosses the water. Will it get over? Doesn\u2019t look like it. No. But hold on! Yes! Just. One foot shorter, and she was wet. But her ball reaches the other side, then creeps onto the edge of the green! She\u2019ll have a look at eagle from 20 feet or so! Meanwhile up on 13, Salas pars, but Ko makes her birdie. The major treble is on, as the ANA Inspiration and Evian champ hits the top at last! -16: JY Ko (13), Salas (13) -14: Shibuno (11) -13: Pressel (12), Buhai (11) -12: Boutier (F), SH Park (12) -9: N Korda (F), Masson (17), Nordqvist (16), Lee6 (16), Ciganda (14) Ko creams an iron from 180 yards straight at the flag on 13. That\u2019s such a beautifully controlled shot. She\u2019ll have a look at birdie, and a share of the lead, from six feet. Salas responds by sending a gentle draw around the tree in her way, and uses the slope of the green to gather her ball round to 20 feet. That\u2019s superb from there. Meanwhile back on 12, Park Sung-hyun moves into credit for the first time today, taking two careful putts for her birdie. The eagle effort was never going in, but that\u2019s got her moving in the right direction at last, with time running out. She\u2019s -12. Disappointing pars for Shibuno and Buhai on the par-five 11th. Shibuno had come up short with her third; Buhai will be more disappointed, having shoved a short birdie putt right. Park, stuck at -11, throws the dice at the risk-and-reward 12th, and is rewarded when she drives the green. She\u2019ll take a look at eagle from 30 feet or so. Meanwhile Salas sends her drive at 13 into the semi-rough on the left. Trees compromise her route straight to the flag on the left, but she can aim for the right-hand side of the green, hoping the camber helps her out. Her playing partner Ko\u2019s drive sails gracefully down the right-hand side of the fairway, the perfect place from which to attack the pin. Morgan Pressel makes her move! The 2007 ANA Inspiration creams her second shot into the par-five 11th, and curls the 15-foot eagle putt she\u2019s left with into the cup! Suddenly she\u2019s right in the mix. And it really is anybody\u2019s Open, because Ko sends her second at 12 to six feet and suddenly she\u2019s just one off the lead! -16: Salas (12) -15: Ko (12) -14: Shubuno (10) -13: Pressel (11), Buhai (10) A sublime round of 66 for Celine Boutier. She had a decent birdie chance at the last, having sent her second pin high to 20 feet, but she misread the break. Still, par, and she\u2019s the new clubhouse leader at -12. It\u2019s almost certainly not enough, unless the leading quartet have a collective breakdown, but it\u2019s a magnificent effort nonetheless, a second top-ten finish in the majors this season. And precious points for the Solheim Cup! -16: Salas (11) -14: Ko (11), Shibuno (10) -13: Buhai (10) -12: Boutier (F) What a shot by Ashleigh Buhai on 10! Her tee shot sails off to the left. She\u2019s got to go over trees if she\u2019s to reach the green. She whips her ball high into the air ... and lands it six feet from the flag! That\u2019s quite sensational from there! She makes a very deserved birdie. There was a bit of pressure on her putt, too, because her playing partner Hinako Shibuno rattled in a 25-footer for birdie of her own from the fringe at the back! Just as well that hit the hole, because it was really travelling. She\u2019s deserved a bit of luck with the flat stick today; she\u2019s had none. The smile\u2019s back. Meanwhile it\u2019s all happening, because up on 11, Lizette Salas whips a lovely third to 12 feet, and in goes the putt for her seventh birdie of the day! -16: Salas (11) -14: JY Ko (11), Shibuno (10) -13: Buhai (10) -12: Boutier (17) Celine Boutier threw away her best chance of a major this year at Charleston in the US Open. Leading going into the final round, she immediately double-bogeyed and never really recovered, the 25-year-old Parisian ending up in a tie for fifth. But she\u2019s giving it one last big heave. She\u2019s putting together a fantastic last round, with birdies at 2, 9, 11, 15, 16 and now 17 rocketing her up the standings to -12. A birdie up the last, and you just never know! -15: Salas (10) -14: JY Ko (10) -13: Shibuno (9) -12: Boutier (17), Buhai (9) Atthaya Thitikul, the 16-year-old Thai, wins the Smyth Salver for low amateur! She finishes in style as well, sending her second at 18 to 15 feet and rattling in the birdie putt. A 73 to end with. She\u2019s -4, six clear of 18-year-old Yuka Yasuda. The young Japanese amateur finished with 77 and ended up very respectably at +2. Congratulations to Atthaya! Jeongeun Lee6\u2019s problems intensify. She sends a hook into the woods down the left of 13, and she\u2019s been put on the clock as well. That really might be it for the US Open champ. Back on 9, Ashleigh Buhai can\u2019t get up and down from the bottom of a grassy bank, and she slips to -12. Par for Hinako Shibuno, who remains two back at -13. The US Open champion Jeongeun Lee6\u2019s race might be run. That careless tee shot on 12 leads to a double-bogey six. Not such a lucky number after all, sad to say. She\u2019s -10. No woman has won the US Open and British Open in the same year, and that record looks like surviving 2019. Especially as Lizette Salas has just arrowed her second straight at the 10th flag, rolling in the 12-foot birdie putt to pull two clear at the top! Albeit only for a few seconds, because her playing partner Ko Jin-young had sent her approach even closer, and she makes birdie as well. -15: Salas (10) -14: JY Ko (10) -13: Buhai (8), Shibuno (8) Park Sung-hyun has, unlike her very large and vocal following, been super-quiet today. But she rolls a 25-footer in for birdie at 9, and she turns in 36 strokes. She\u2019s back where she started the day, at -11, just three off the pace currently set by Lizette Salas. A couple more birdies and she\u2019s right in the thick of it. The short par-four 12th is a real risk-or-reward affair. Take the drivable green on, or lay up in front of the water that guards the dancefloor? Jeonguen Lee6 plays it safe with iron ... but really smacks it, and sends her ball scampering into the briny! A terrible mistake, and one that could compromise her charge. Meanwhile a three-putt bogey for Hinako Shibuno from the fringe at the back of the par-three 8th. Smiling Cinderella isn\u2019t living up to her name right now, but she was miserable when struggling on the front nine yesterday, too ... then came back in 30 shots. A lot of story yet to be told. \u201cThis tournament is phenomenal and has everything a fan could want,\u201d writes Lucy Wesson. \u201cThank you for the last three days and for coverage of this amazing finish!\u201d We aim to please, Lucy. You\u2019ll be back for the Solheim Cup, right? -14: Salas (9) -13: JY Ko (9), Buhai (8), Shibuno (8) Morgan Pressel tickles a treacherous downhill putt on 8 into the cup. A first birdie of the day for the 2007 ANA Inspiration champion. Up on 9, Lizette Salas sticks her second to four feet, and makes the putt for birdie and a share. Since the five-major era began in 2013, the USA have always had at least one major winner each calendar year. It\u2019s up to Pressel or Salas to keep that run going. -14: Salas (9), Shibuno (7) -13: JY Ko (9), Buhai (7) -12: Lee6 (11) -11: Pressel (8) Hinako Shibuno finds the green at the par-five 7th in two big lashes. She can really cream it. The long eagle putt stops three feet short, and that\u2019s a birdie that gives her the outright lead again! The damage of that four-putt has now been completely repaired. Buhai laid up, didn\u2019t wedge close, but nearly drained a long birdie putt. One turn short, and that\u2019s par. Meanwhile up on 18, Nelly Korda signs for a 69 and takes the clubhouse lead at -9. It can\u2019t be too long before she makes her major breakthrough. A fine run through the field that only ran out of steam on the back nine. The story of her week. A final round of 69 for the PGA champion Hannah Green. Having nearly missed the cut, she\u2019s done extremely well over the weekend to finish the week at -7. She shares the clubhouse lead with Lexi Thompson and Teresa Lu, the Thai ending her round in disappointing fashion: bogey, bogey. A 69, but it promised so much more. Salas isn\u2019t far away from stroking a 30-footer in for birdie from the back fringe of 8. A tap-in for par will suffice. She remains -13, as does Ko, who doesn\u2019t give her right-to-left birdie curler from 12 feet any chance. Back on 7, another birdie effort passes by for Park Sung-hyun. She remains at -10, just three off the lead. But there\u2019s no sense of her gaining any sort of forward momentum. She\u2019s been very flat today, just as she was in France last Sunday. Ko Jin-young is hoping to become only the seventh player in history to win three majors in the same calendar year. She\u2019d be keeping some fairly illustrious company: Babe Zaharias, Mickey Wright, Pat Bradley, Inbee Park, Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods are the only folk to have managed it before. She very nearly jumps into the outright lead, an inch or so away from stroking in a 30-foot eagle putt on 7. But a kick-in birdie gives her a share with Hinako Shibuno, who pars 6; Lizette Salas, who birdies 7; and Ashleigh Buhai, whose tee shot into 6 isn\u2019t much cop, but is followed up with a 40-foot rake for birdie. Good luck predicting the winner of this one. -13: Salas (7), JY Ko (7), Buhai (6), Shibuno (6) -12: Lee6 (9) -10: Pressel (6), SH Park (6) But at least Georgia Hall signs off with a birdie! She sends her second at 18 pin high to 15 feet, and rattles in the putt. A final round of 73 and she ends the defence of her title at -3. That\u2019s a fine performance by a player who came into this tournament out of form. And she\u2019ll always have Lytham. There\u2019ll be no English winner this year, though. Bronte Law has dropped yet another shot, this time at 8. She\u2019s clattered down the standings to -5. Meanwhile Charley Hull whistles her tee shot at 7 out of bounds, and runs up a double bogey that sends her down to -6. Hinako Shibuno has suffered three lip-outs already. But now on 6, a 15-foot birdie effort looks like missing by an inch on the left, only to be snaffled by the edge of the hole for birdie. Such spirit! She regains sole ownership of the lead at -13. This is such an exciting tournament. This is really cooking up now! At the Evian last week, Ko Jin-young started the final day four shots behind the leader. She began her round today four off the pace. Is she going to come through the field to win a second major in a week, and her third of the year? She sends her tee shot at 6 to eight feet, and strokes in a nerveless birdie putt. And with her playing partner Lizette Salas making an extremely careless and slightly nervous three-putt bogey, it\u2019s suddenly a five-way tie at the top! -12: Lee6 (8), JY Ko (6), Salas (6), Shibuno (4), Buhai (4) -10: SH Park (5), Pressel (5) No woman has ever won the US Open and the British Open in the same year. But records are there to be broken, and Jeongeun Lee6 has just drained a monster birdie effort across 8! The victor a couple of months ago at Charleston is now just a shot off the lead. -13: Salas (5) -12: Lee6 (8), Buhai (4), Shibuno (4) Marina Alex, who turned in 34 after early birdies at 2 and 3, continues to climb the leaderboard. Birdies at 11 and 12 have risen her to -9. She\u2019s alongside Nelly Korda, who slips back after bogey at 14. And news of Carlota Ciganda, who was going along so well before a farcical double-bogey on 18 yesterday evening. Bogeys today at 1 and 4, and she\u2019s slipped off the pace. She\u2019s -7, and major glory continues to elude the consistent Spaniard. Shibuno hasn\u2019t changed her gameplan in the wake of that four-putt double. She gives her 20-footer a good rattle. It lips out - her third of the round already - and rolls three feet past. No mistake this time, though, and she tucks away the par putt. But Buhai judges her right-to-left birdie putt from the fringe perfectly, and that\u2019s a much-needed shift in momentum for the 30-year-old South African. Meanwhile birdie for Ko Jin-young at 5. It\u2019s busy at the top. -13: Salas (5) -12: Shibuno (4), Buhai (4) -11: Lee6 (7), JY Ko (5) A fine iron into 4 by Ashleigh Buhai. Pin high, ten feet away. If she can get her putter warmed up again, she can kick-start her stalled campaign. Her playing partner, and fellow former leader, Hinako Shibuno sends her second straight at the pin, though she\u2019s a good 20 feet short. Meanwhile birdie for the US Open champ Jeongeun Lee6 at the par-five 7th, which she reached in two. She joins Buhai in third at -11. That was a mixture of carelessness and inexperience from Hinako Shibuno. She\u2019d benefited from a huge stroke of luck with her approach, shoved right and heading towards a bunker poking into the side of the green. But her ball skipped over the sand and came to rest on the dancefloor. She really went for the long birdie putt, which showed swashbuckling intent if nothing else. You know who else led from the front with swashbuckling intent? Jean van de Velde, that\u2019s who. Unlike the hapless Frenchman, Shibuno has plenty of time to repair the damage. And at least the Smiling Cinderella is still living up to her name as she walks away from the scene of the crime, so she\u2019s not allowing her head to drop yet. Shibuno\u2019s left herself a tricky downhill par putt. And it lips out on the right, the ball racing three feet past. She pulls the one coming back, and that\u2019s a horrific four-putt double bogey. Her first serious mistake of the week. And suddenly Lizette Salas leads the British Open! -13: Salas (4) -12: Shibuno (3) -11: Buhai (3) -10: Korda (13), Lee6 (6), JY Ko (4), SH Park (3), Pressel (3) One of the shots of the week on 4 by Lizette Salas. She lands her approach five feet from a flag tucked away on the right. And that\u2019s her third birdie in the first four holes! What a start. And there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll give her a share of the lead at -13, because on 3, Hinako Shibuno races a long birdie effort four feet past the hole. That\u2019s missable. Bounceback birdie for Nelly Korda at 12. She\u2019s met at -10 by Park Sung-hyun, heading the other way. The world number two\u2019s second into 3 snags on the bank to the left of the green. She faces a treacherous chip downhill towards the hole, and plays a clever flop into the thick rough, taking as much pace off the ball as possible before it springs onto the green. But it still rolls 20 feet past. As good as she could do, but she can\u2019t make the one coming back and that\u2019s a bogey. Is the super-popular South Korean suffering from final-round nerves yet again? She was all over the place at the Evian last Sunday. This is becoming an increasing problem for a player who has freely admitted to suffering from day-four jitters. Bronte Law\u2019s race looks run already. She\u2019s followed up that opening-hole bogey with two more in short order, at 3 and now 5. She clatters down the standings to -6. Easy to forget this is her rookie year. This experience will stand her in good stead. English hopes appear slim, then, with Charley Hull also going backwards after a bogey-birdie-bogey start. She\u2019s -8. Oh Su-hyun parred her way home after the aforementioned birdie blitz. A fine final-day 66 and she ends the week at -6. Lexi Thompson meanwhile sent a tramliner into the hole on 18 for a valedictory birdie, and the 2014 ANA Inspiration champion is the new clubhouse leader at -7. A fine end to a difficult week for Lexi. Shibuno lays up from the semi-rough on 2, then wedges to ten feet. It looks as though she\u2019s read her right-to-left slider perfectly, but it lips out. She yelps in bemusement but is soon smiling again as per usual. Buhai\u2019s approach meanwhile was superb, spun to six feet. But she can\u2019t make the short birdie effort. Where\u2019s the Buhai of the first two-and-a-half days? She needs to return quicksmart. -14: Shibuno (2) -12: Salas (3) -11: SH Park (2), Buhai (2) -10: Lee6 (5), JY Ko (3), Pressel (2) -9: N Korda (11), Nordqvist (5) Thanks John. That\u2019s me back just in time to see Morgan Pressel miss a six-foot birdie opportunity on 2. She remains at -10. She\u2019s joined there by Jeongeun Lee6, who follows birdie at 3 with another at 5. Park Sung-hyun has opened with a pair of pars, a long birdie effort on 2 stopping right on the lip. She stays at -11. But Nelly Korda\u2019s is stumbling on the back nine yet again. Trouble off the tee at 11, and the resulting bogey sends her back to -9. Charley Hull is having a wild start to her afternoon. She has had to lay up after whacking her tee shot on the third into the trees. Par is going to be problematic; the putt she has for a saver is fully 40 feet. It doesn\u2019t go in. Bogey it is. Behind her, Shibuno\u2019s drive on the second has taken her into some semi-rough. Work to do to make birdie on the par five. Buhai\u2019s shot is far better, and on the fairway. Anyway, that\u2019s me done. Scott Murray is back in the chair to guide Shibuno - or AN Other - home to the final major of the year. Ko, on the second, has a birdie to play for but drifts her shot to the left of the hole. That\u2019s two pars in a row. Buhai\u2019s chance of par looks distant as her lie at the bunker is dreadful; she has to lean over and play with her feet out of the sand. The shot is OK, but she has 20 feet or so to make par. Shibuno collects her par having failed to get the ball up the hill for her putt; the saver shot is hit with confidence. Salas, meanwhile, has made another birdie and is now two shots off the lead at -12. She has second place to herself as Buhai\u2019s putt falls short to go to -11. Nelly Korda\u2019s charge slows up with a par - rather than birdie - on the tenth. She has still made the jump from 18th to fifth. Shibuno\u2019s shot to the first is good, but the bounce of the green means she has a tough shot for birdie. Still, Buhai is in worse trouble, playing from the edge of one bunker to landing straight in the sand of another. Here comes Shibuno, with a Cheshire Cat smile, to the tee. Nobody is enjoying this weekend more than her. Ashleigh Buhai goes first, and how will she recover from losing that five-shot lead? She goes close to a bunker but ends up with a decent lie. Shibuno curtsies as she goes to address the ball, then collects herself, the smile withdrawn for a moment and her swing is true. It wasn\u2019t the longest drive of the day but it is well positioned and safe. Charley Hull\u2019s bunker shot at the second is OK, but leaves her with work to do to make a birdie, work to which she is more than equal. That\u2019s a great shot. Pressel and Park take to the first tee as the penultimate pairing to go. Morgan Pressel goes first, and she punches a bouncer that bounds down the fairway. Sung Hyun Park\u2019s power off the tee takes her way beyond her partner, and she has quite a loud support behind her. Salas starts her day with a birdie and with a confident ten-yard putt. Charley Hull\u2019s confidence, meanwhile, may have been sapped again. Her second shot to the first fails to make it over the bunker and she may well be plugged. Ko takes her second to the first, and it is something of a pull, nowhere near as good as Salas, her playing partner. Charley Hull throws off the disappointment on the first with a confident drive. Bronte Law collects a par on the second up ahead. Nelly Korda is four off the lead and if she continues like this will have presented a significant target to aim at for those following her in. Lizette Salas steps up to the oche for her first drive. The applause for that is deserved. A beauty. Here goes Ko Jin-young, who swipes her drive into the fairway without much of a backwards glance. The younger Korda is on the ninth and her shot from the fairway almost holes out. She collects a fourth birdie in a row, and it might have been an eagle, that\u2019s 31 for the front nine. Charley Hull\u2019s putt on the first is a miss, and a bogey it is, just like Bronte Law. A disappointing start for them both. Ciganda, having been within 12 feet of birdie, gets a bogey on the second. A third birdie in a row for Nelly Korda, this time at 8. She\u2019s -9 and smiling broadly. Speaking of which, Hinako Shibuno tees off in 25 minutes. Right now, she\u2019s on the driving range posing for selfies with fans, her range nameplate tucked under her arm. She\u2019s either helping officials tidy up, or snaffling a souvenir. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s extremely endearing. She\u2019s unquestionably got star quality. Speaking of unquestionable star quality, here comes John Brewin! He\u2019ll be your guide while I take a quick break before everything gets very real. See you soon. Law\u2019s chip back up isn\u2019t quite as explosive as she\u2019d like. A weak effort that stops 15 feet short. She can\u2019t make the putt and it\u2019s her first bogey of the week. She slips back to -8. Who knows, the end of that run might act as a release. The mind does strange things. Meanwhile par for her playing partner Jing Yan who remains at -8. Back on the tee, Woburn member Charley Hull and Carlota Ciganda crack their opening drives down the fairway without too much fuss. And a tap-in birdie for Nelly Korda on 7, after two big hits and an eagle putt from 15 feet left one turn short. She\u2019s -8. Bronte Law takes to the 1st tee. A huge reception for one of England\u2019s two big hopes. But the gallery soon falls silent as she pulls a nervy opening drive towards the trees on the left. She\u2019s lucky that her ball nestles in the semi-rough after clipping some branches. But she\u2019s got the best part of 200 yards still to go, and though her second shot is decent, she can\u2019t spin it to a stop on the green from the rough, and it bounds over the back and down a bank. She\u2019s not dropped a shot all week, a quite unbelievable run. Some work needs to be done here if that record\u2019s to be maintained. Nelly Korda is mooching along nicely. Birdies at 1 and now 6. She\u2019s -7, and making hay while the sun shines, because the closing holes been the problem for the big-hitting 21-year-old Floridian this week. Nine birdies this week on the first seven holes; on the last 11, just four plus six bogeys. The bizarro Shibuno. Oh Su-hyun is putting something pretty special together. Her run of four consecutive birdies ended with par on 14. But no matter! She\u2019s back on the horse again quickly enough, picking up her fifth stroke on the back nine at 15. She\u2019s -6, and tearing it up since the turn. The sort of behaviour that we should probably describe as Shibunoesque, the leader having played the back nine in 30 strokes not once but twice this week. Maria Torres pars the last, and she signs for a wonderful final round of 67. She ends the week at -5. Shame she\u2019s not able to put a British Open hole in one on her CV, having come so very close at 14 on Thursday. But it\u2019s been a good week for the first Puerto Rican on the LPGA Tour. Torres is the very early clubhouse leader. Two increasingly nervous teenage amateurs are fighting for the Smyth Salver. Yuka Yasuda, 18, makes back-to-back bogeys on 7 and 8. Then 16-year-old Atthaya Thitikul yips a short one on 2, before three-putting 3. Back-to-back bogeys for her as well. But make no mistake, these young women can play; the fact both are still under par for the week is testament to that. Yasuda is -2, Thitikul -3. Taiwan\u2019s Teresa Lu had a share of the 54-hole lead in this event back in 2015. But she fell away in the final round at Turnberry, collapsing to a 74, Inbee Park winning her only British Open instead. Round four is treating her much better today: birdies at 2, 4 and 5 have launched her up the standings to -7. About time for our first updated leaderboard of the day, I would say. -14: Shibuno -12: Buhai -11: SH Park -10: Pressel, JY Ko, Salas -9: Ciganda, Hull, Law -8: Yan, Lee6 -7: Lu (5), Alex (4), Nordqvist, Masson Four birdies in a row for Oh Su-hyun! The latest at 13. She rises to -5. Her antics will give the chasing pack succour, even if scoring across the board isn\u2019t quite as low as it\u2019s been for the first three days. Marina Alex nearly aced 8 on Friday, her 29th birthday. A birdie and a round of 70 wasn\u2019t a bad consolation prize, though. A low round today, and she might just improve on her best result in a major, a tie for ninth in this event at Birkdale back in 2014. She\u2019s made back-to-back birdies at 2 and 3, springing up the standings to -7. That\u2019s currently a tie for 12th, and there\u2019s a spring in her step. Another birdie for Oh Su-hyun, this time at 12. She\u2019s -4 for both her round and the tournament overall. A hot streak, but Maria Torres has just gone one better. Another birdie for the Puerto Rican at 15, and she\u2019s -5 for both her efforts today and the entire week. The leading amateur will lift the Smyth Salver, a prize donated by eponymous former Ladies Golf Union president Moira. (That\u2019s Moira Smyth, not Moira Salver. Or Moira Smyth-Salver.) Anyway, some pretty darn big names have won this thing in recent years: Michelle Wie, Amy Yang, Mel Reid, Anna Nordqvist, Danielle Kang, Lydia Ko and Georgia Hall. That\u2019s some roll call. Today\u2019s battle is between the only two amateurs to survive the cut, Yuka Yasuda of Japan and Atthaya Thitikul of Thailand. Yasuda started the day two shots back at -3, and having dropped a stroke at the opening hole, she\u2019s just rolled in a couple of fine birdie putts, at 5 and 6. She\u2019s -4, now just the one behind Thitikul, who has parred the 1st. The wind\u2019s beginning to swirl, setting the players one or two posers to solve. Though it\u2019s yet to become too much for Oh Su-hyun. The 23-year-old Korean-born Aussie finished in a tie for 15th last year at Lytham, and is threatening another decent result this year. Birdies at 7, 10 and now 11 have brought her up to -3. It all went wrong for the defending champion Georgia Hall on the 9th yesterday. She hooked her drive into a waist-high thicket, and a double-bogey was the almost inevitable consequence. Ever since then, with the knowledge that holding onto her title was now a pipe dream, her play\u2019s gone a bit flat. She signed for a 74, and it\u2019s three uneventful pars to start this morning. However, when the dust settles she\u2019ll look back on this week with pride. Her 2019 form has been distinctly average by her own standards, but she\u2019s managed to raise her game back to a level where a successful defence was a genuine possibility for the first two-and-a-half days. A week that will hopefully get her back on track. And hey, she\u2019ll always have Lytham. She\u2019s -4. Having said all that, there\u2019s evidence of some decent scoring out on the course right now. Maria Torres of Puerto Rico nearly made a hole-in-one on Thursday, inches away from slam-dunking a hybrid straight into the cup at 14. She\u2019s on her game again today: birdies at 2, 4, 5, 11 and now 12, and she\u2019s looking to finish strong at -4. China\u2019s Xiyu Lin meanwhile was out in 33. A shot just gone at 13, but she\u2019s going along nicely at -2. So ... taking advantage of calm early conditions, or a sign that we\u2019re in for more of the same? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. The weather\u2019s was the field\u2019s friend during the first three days. Sunny and still, perfect conditions for low scoring. Woburn\u2019s Marquess Course might play a little harder today, though, if the forecasts prove correct. The rain promised today hasn\u2019t materialised yet, but the wind is up a little. Nothing dramatic, but enough to give the players pause. If it continues to pick up, it could become quite a test. Shibuno\u2019s golfing hero is Lexi Thompson. The passport-misplacing shenanigans of Monday took their toll on Thompson, who was mortified that her mistake led to a chain of events that eventually cost 40 players their first practice round. And so the 2014 ANA Inspiration champion has never really featured this week. Rounds of 71, 70 and 73 mean she was one of the earlier starters today. But she\u2019s going along nicely. Birdies at 1 and now 5 whisk her up the leaderboard to -4. Marie Kondo is one of Japan\u2019s most famous exports, but the renowned lifestyle guru has nothing on her compatriot Hinako Shibuno. Kondo is all about doing those things that \u201cspark joy\u201d; well, the 20-year-old Shibuno sparks joy wherever she goes. Known back home as Smiling Cinderella in honour of her infectious good cheer, she\u2019s warmed Woburn this week with her constant crowd interaction, giving the punters thumbs up, posing for selfies with kids, handing out signed gloves. She runs around replacing divots. Oh, and the golf\u2019s not half bad either. Yesterday, after hitting a rough patch mid-round, she came back in 30 strokes. She drives straight and long, approaches with unerring accuracy, and makes her fair share of putts. And so, she leads the British Open by two. She\u2019s doing all this on her major-championship debut. It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s played competitively outside Japan! Perhaps she\u2019ll lift the trophy today. Perhaps this will be the day that finally overwhelms her. Or perhaps she\u2019ll simply be overtaken by a storming round from Ashleigh Buhai, who was leading by five at one point yesterday ... or the world number one Ko Jin-young ... or the world number two Park Sung-hyun ... or Lizette Salas, a woman whose putt has won a Solheim Cup ... or Carlota Ciganda, hoping to win Spain\u2019s first major ... or Morgan Pressel, hoping to win the USA\u2019s first major this year ... or Bronte Law, yet to make a bogey this week ... or Charley Hull, playing on her home course. Whatever happens, we won\u2019t be forgetting Hinako Shibuno, who has announced her talent to the world this week in style. It promises to be one heck of a fourth round. The joy-sparking begins here soon. It\u2019s on! This is what happened yesterday ... in Ewan Murray\u2019s report form, and in live Hole-by-Hole blog form. Here\u2019s the very top of the leaderboard ... -14: Shibuno -12: Buhai -11: SH Park -10: Pressel, JY Ko, Salas -9: Ciganda, Hull, Law And here are today\u2019s tee times ... 8.30 Felicity Johnson (Eng), Gerina Piller (US) 8.40 Annabel Dimmock (Eng), Mariajo Uribe (Col) 8.50 Charlotte Thomas (Eng), Jodi Ewart Shadoff (Eng) 9.00 Hur Mi-jung (Kor), Austin Ernst (US) 9.10 Linnea Strom (Swe), Sarah Schmelzel (US) 9.20 Sarah Kemp (Aus), Kim In-kyung (Kor) 9.30 Caroline Hedwall (Swe), Nicole Broch Larsen (Den) 9.40 Maria Torres (Pur), Lin Xiyu (Chn) 9.50 Momoko Ueda (Jpn), Cheyenne Knight (US) 10.05 Anne Van Dam (Ned), Azahara Munoz (Spa) 10.15 Su Oh (Aus), Jasmine Suwannapura (Tha) 10.25 Brittany Lang (US), Annie Park (US) 10.35 Angel Yin (US), Chun In Gee (Kor) 10.45 Brooke Henderson (Can), Megan Khang (US) 10.55 Lexi Thompson (US), Mirim Lee (Kor) 11.05 Yu Liu (Chn), Ayako Uehara (Jpn) 11.15 Karo Lampert (Ger), Minami Katsu (Jpn) 11.25 Pornanong Phatlum (Tha), Angela Stanford (US) 11.40 Danielle Kang (US), Olivia Cowan (Ger) 11.50 Ally Mcdonald (US), Yuka Yasuda -a- (Jpn) 12.00 Jessica Korda (US), Georgia Hall (Eng) 12.10 Kim Hyo-joo (Kor), Jenny Shin (Kor) 12.20 Teresa Lu (Tai), Hannah Green (Aus) 12.30 Nelly Korda (US), Marina Alex (US) 12.40 Minjee Lee (Aus), Jeongeun Lee (Kor) 12.50 Moriya Jutanugarn (Tha), Atthaya Thitikul -a- (Tha) 1.00 Kim Sei-young (Kor), Brittany Altomare (US) 1.15 Kristen Gillman (US), Celine Boutier (Fra) 1.25 Ariya Jutanugarn (Tha), Pavarisa Yoktuan (Tha) 1.35 Sakura Yokomine (Jpn), Caroline Masson (Ger) 1.45 Anna Nordqvist (Swe), Jeongeun Lee6 (Kor) 1.55 Jing Yan (Chn), Bronte Law (Eng) 2.05 Charley Hull (Eng), Carlota Ciganda (Spa) 2.15 Lizette Salas (US), Ko Jin-young (Kor) 2.25 Morgan Pressel (US), Park Sung-hyun (Kor) 2.35 Ashleigh Buhai (RSA), Hinako Shibuno (Jap)",

      "bodyText": "Protesters have taken to the streets of Hong Kong for another round of mass anti-government demonstrations as political unrest continues to roil the city. Ahead of a city-wide strike and simultaneous protests in seven districts, on Sunday night protesters evaded and frustrated the police by holding flashmob demonstrations. Groups of protesters scattered, switching locations at the last minute and disappearing before riot police were able to arrive en masse. Protesters deviated from a previously planned rally in Hong Kong\u2019s Western district, where police had prepared to defend China\u2019s liaison office, a target in previous unrest. Demonstrators moved east to Causeway Bay, a major shopping district where they occupied main roads and disrupted traffic. Police fired several rounds of teargas on protesters there but many had already moved to other locations. In a park in Wan Chai, protesters defaced a statue of a golden bauhinia flower, a gift from China when Hong Kong was returned to Chinese control in 1997. The monument was spraypainted with the words: \u201cHeaven will destroy the Communist party,\u201d and \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d. This is the ninth week of consecutive protests in Hong Kong, as the semi-autonomous city faces a political crisis that has deepened as authorities have tried to suppress it. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has disappeared from public view over the last two weeks. \u201cI came to support Hong Kong. We are showing our guts to the government,\u201d said Peter Tsang, 32, who attended the march in Tseung Kwan O. \u201cA lot of people have come and they are stepping up because Carrie Lam has not come out of hiding.\u201d In a statement released in the early hours of Monday, the Hong Kong government said \u201cthe deteriorating situation\u201d showed protests were \u201cspreading [and] pushing Hong Kong to the verge of a very dangerous situation.\u201d As the protests wear on, demonstrators have begun shifting strategies while authorities arrest more people and deploy harsher tactics against them. Police have arrested more than 60 people and charged 44 of them with rioting, a crime that could mean up to 10 years in prison. \u201cThe protesters are trying to use up the energy of the police,\u201d said Yan, 26, a protester in Causeway Bay. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to be arrested or hurt any more, so we didn\u2019t stay in set places.

Earlier in the day, after a peaceful rally in Tseung Kwan O in Hong Kong\u2019s New Territories, protesters broke the windows of a police station, using a makeshift catapult to launch objects at the building. The protests, which began over an extradition bill to send suspects to China, have turned into a broader political movement demanding accountability from the Hong Kong government, which ultimately answers to Beijing. The former British colony, which reverted to Chinese control in 1997, is meant to enjoy a \u201chigh degree\u201d of autonomy from the mainland as part of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework, but residents say their freedoms are slowly disappearing under China\u2019s influence. The police have been criticised for what some say have been overly harsh tactics towards protesters, many of them students or recent graduates. In July, dozens of masked men dressed in white beat commuters with iron and wooden rods, shocking Hongkongers and eroding trust in the police, who did not stop the attack. Anger at the police and the Hong Kong government has spread from the protesters to the general public, as thousands of residents have joined weekend rallies and protests. Sunday\u2019s protests marked the fourth day in a row of mass demonstrations.

On Monday the Greens will unveil plans to introduce legislation for a two-year trial, including a mobile pill-testing facility to attend music festivals and a fixed-site laboratory that could test drugs all through the year. The legislation will be known as \u201cDaniel\u2019s Bill\u201d after Daniel Buccianti, who died of a drug overdose at the Rainbow Serpent festival in 2012. His mother, Adriana Buccianti, now a drug reform campaigner, said pill-testing was not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d but would protect young people like her son. \u201cWhen a person dies of a drug overdose that has a lot of stigma attached to it,\u201d she said. \u201cI [don\u2019t] want parents to go through that \u2026 It\u2019s clear that whatever it is that we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working.\u201d Despite strong support from the Australian Medical Association for a trial, and the Victorian government\u2019s controversial decision to establish a medically supervised drug-injecting room trial, the premier has steadfastly opposed the idea. He dismissed comparisons to the injecting room in March, adding that the idea behind pill-testing was \u201cwrong and potentially dangerous because it misleads people\u201d. Buccianti told Guardian Australia: \u201cI would really like Mr Andrews to just put himself in my position for just 10 seconds and see what it feels like. \u201cHaving the person that you love most in your life never coming back, never having a Christmas, never having a birthday. \u201cHe needs to look at the greater good.

The trial would be reviewed after one year, with the possibility of it being extended to a four-year pilot. The data collected would allow the chief health officer to issue a health alert to warn members about a lethal batch of drugs, the policy states.

Clara has sold bureaucrats and ministers on a vision so large it\u2019s almost eye-watering: a high-speed rail network between Melbourne and Sydney that would open the way for not one but eight new cities, each between 200,0000 and 600,000 people, to be constructed along its route.</p> <p>They would rise from the paddocks over the next 50 years, taking the pressure off Sydney and Melbourne as workers moved to the regions, but still with access to highly paid jobs just an hour away by rail.</p> <p>Some of the new centres would be planned for the outskirts of existing regional towns, helping to revive their economies.</p> <p>\u201cThe policy on population has failed because we have failed to overcome the tyranny of distance,\u201d Cleary says. \u201cBetween now and 2061 we are going to grow the population by 15 million.

And all to be achieved by the private sector, with only minimal government involvement.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time,\u201d Cleary says.</p> <p>But can Clara deliver on the vision?</p> <h2>Too good to be true?</h2> <p>The $8m given to Clara is for a business case for the first stage, a line between Melbourne and Shepparton, and two new cities at Nagambie and Shepparton. Clara\u2019s plan, which at this stage does not specify a technology, says it can cut the travel time between Melbourne and Shepparton from three hours to just 32 minutes. </p> <p>Too good to be true?</p> <p>An investigation by the Guardian has revealed that Clara has no office \u2013 its principal place of business, according to Asic records, is the office of its law firm, DLA Piper in Melbourne. It has just $422,000 in paid-up capital and so far has no major shareholders or directors with expertise in infrastructure projects, property development, construction or financing.</p> <p>Asic searches show a web of companies behind Clara, but the ultimate controlling shareholders are Cleary, his wife, Erin Cleary, and his assistant, Alexandra Johnson, who acts as Clara\u2019s contact point.</p> <p>Cleary says there is a separate consortium agreement and \u201cthere are a number of firms that are funding us while we pass those milestones\u201d of developing the business plan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1440a3e920919f04ceded486410bd417d26be98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1440a3e920919f04ceded486410bd417d26be98/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An irrigation channel on Trevor Hosie\u2019s farm near Tallygaroopna\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An irrigation channel on Trevor Hosie\u2019s farm near Tallygaroopna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He names the computer giant Cisco; the Japanese industrial company Hitachi; the urban planners Roberts Day and Clarke Hopkins Clarke; the consultant PWC; and DLA Piper.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 16 firms who have signed up to the Clara consortium,\u201d Cleary says. \u201cThey are part of Clara to deliver a strategic vision. Our financing is coming from large-scale institutional money down the track. We have to go through those milestones.\u201d</p> <p>He says a number of companies are providing in-kind support. DLA Piper acknowledged that the firm was doing work for Clara, but expressed surprise that it was listed as the consortium\u2019s principal place of business.</p> <p>Cleary also says he has secured some of the crucial land around the sites of the first two new cities. \u201cWe have some land in our control around those locations. It\u2019s around those areas, about 10km from Shepparton.\u201d</p> <p>But Clara has also had some setbacks. When it launched in 2016, its advisory board included several high-profile former politicians including the former Victorian premier Steve Bracks, the former NSW premier Barry O\u2019Farrell and the former federal trade minister Andrew Robb. Only Robb remains.</p> <p>Robb describes himself as an enthusiastic supporter. \u201cI think there will be a level of surprise about the comprehensive nature of the business plan,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be all taxpayer dollars. Governments are increasingly using value creation as a source of funding. Hong Kong hasn\u2019t spent any taxpayer funds on its underground. Instead it identifies where it will build stations and buys up the land, then builds the retail centres and apartments.\u201d</p> <p>The Melbourne wealth management company Newhaven was also involved, but its principal, Jay Grant, who served as the consortium\u2019s managing director, pulled out. So did some of the Americans Clara had approached, including a former US transport secretary, Ray LaHood.</p> <h2>\u2018He had our hopes right up\u2019</h2> <p>The Guardian has also learned that many of the options Clara signed with landowners along the proposed route for the high-speed train have lapsed, leaving a bitter taste for farmers who were swept away by Cleary\u2019s promises of cities rising from the paddocks.</p> <p>Rather than put the line though the centre of Shepparton, a move likely to lead to objections, Cleary\u2019s plan involves finding the greenest of greenfield sites. He began securing land around the eight sites for proposed new cities in 2016. One is at Tallygaroopna, population 579, just north of Shepparton.</p> <p>The farmers who signed up with Cleary in 2017 thought they were on the cusp of a gold rush that would change their lives. But two years on Cleary has not been seen for months, and the options agreements have lapsed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"27a1aaec8aa14de8d41acc0e50e55748c8a810e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27a1aaec8aa14de8d41acc0e50e55748c8a810e5/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmer Trevor Hosie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor Hosie was offered compensation for some of the land on his farm near Tallygaroopna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trevor Hosie, who has 120 hectares with \u201ca few sheep and cattle and a bit of irrigation\u201d says it was October or November when he last saw Cleary.</p> <p>Cleary and his offsider, Alex Johnson, brought teams of engineers and investors to visit the site, but last year the visits stopped, and no one in Tallygaroopna has seen Cleary for about eight months.</p> <p>\u201cI signed an agreement but it was all their way,\u201d Hosie says. \u201cThere was a three-month option, then another one, but then it ran out in October last year.\u201d He had been promised nearly $3m for his farm.</p> <p>Greig Buckland, a dairy farmer, is particularly aggrieved. \u201cWe signed up to it in 2016,\u201d Buckland says, having first spent money on lawyers. </p> <p>\u201cHe told me he\u2019d let me know when it was going public and he did call me the day before it was in the media. He was on TV saying they would be turning the first sod in 2018. But 12 months went by and nothing. I could have sold the dairy farm in that 12 months.\u201d</p> <p>He add: \u201cHe had our hopes right up there. I have tried ringing him many times but got nowhere.\u201d</p> <p>Other farmers, including Neville Moss of Glenara Angus Stud, were sceptical. Moss says he told Cleary: \u201cI\u2019ll sign when you hand over the money to one of the others.\u201d He is still waiting.</p> <p>Around Nagambie it\u2019s a similar story. Philip Deane, 65, signed up to sell his land, 8km north-east of the town. He went to the launch at RMIT and was excited by the vision outlined by Cleary and his associates, but especially by the $20m Cleary was offering for his farm.</p> <p>But the option has now lapsed, along with Deane\u2019s dreams of a comfortable retirement. His son, Wesley, has come back to run the farm.</p> <p>Cleary insists he still has options on land earmarked for the eight cities.</p> <h2>\u2018We have not gone and assessed that\u2019</h2> <p>Cleary\u2019s background seems to have passed the Department of Infrastructure by when it funded him.</p> <p>Around the southern highlands, memories of Cleary\u2019s plan for developing dairy farms, his own included, are still raw. Several families lost money.</p> <p>Asic records show that the agricultural finance company CNH Capital filed to place him in bankruptcy in May 2010. Cleary sought to discharge the bankruptcy a year later but failed to provide written information about his property and income. He was discharged from bankruptcy in June 2013.</p> <p>In an excruciating session of Senate estimates last year the deputy secretary of the then Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities, Luke Yeaman, and the head of rail policy, Andrew Hyles, were forced to admit they were not aware of Cleary\u2019s bankruptcy or that Clara had just $422,700 in capitalisation.</p> <p>\u201cWe fundamentally assess the proposed project that was put in front of us by the company on the basis of the criteria that were in front of us,\u201d Yeaman said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go through a detailed assessment of the company\u2019s history,\u201d he said under questioning from the Labor senator Murray Watt.</p> <p>Watt then played his ace. \u201cWas the department aware that Mr Cleary is a longtime member of the National party, and that at one time he was even a vice-chairman of the New South Wales Nationals?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5af29fab031b988af0e557abf77021ac1e66ae20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5af29fab031b988af0e557abf77021ac1e66ae20/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmer Trevor Hosie on his farm near Tallygaroopna, Victoria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor Hosie on his Tallygaroopna farm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hyles said there were a range of partners with the company and that these were \u201cinternational firms\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re supporting Clara with their own in-kind contributions towards the work of building up this business case,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said he was aware of Clara securing land options. \u201cWe have not gone and assessed that ourselves at this stage,\u201d Hyles said.</p> <p>Who the responsible minister was when Clara was chosen as frontrunner to build the most important infrastructure project of this century is less easy to say.</p> <p>Responsibility for fast rail is shared between the minister for infrastructure and transport and the minister responsible for cities \u2013 and the people occupying both jobs have changed regularly.</p> <p>Angus Taylor, who hails from Goulburn, has been an advocate for the Sydney-to-Melbourne fast rail, as it would go through his electorate.

      "bodyText": "The federal government gave $8m of $20m earmarked to progress high-speed rail to a consortium led by a man who has no expertise in major infrastructure projects, who had been a bankrupt and who was once a National party candidate. The Consolidated Land and Rail Australia consortium, better known by its acronym Clara, is headed by Nick Cleary, a would-be property developer from the southern highlands of New South Wales. Cleary is a man with big dreams. Clara has sold bureaucrats and ministers on a vision so large it\u2019s almost eye-watering: a high-speed rail network between Melbourne and Sydney that would open the way for not one but eight new cities, each between 200,0000 and 600,000 people, to be constructed along its route. They would rise from the paddocks over the next 50 years, taking the pressure off Sydney and Melbourne as workers moved to the regions, but still with access to highly paid jobs just an hour away by rail. Some of the new centres would be planned for the outskirts of existing regional towns, helping to revive their economies. \u201cThe policy on population has failed because we have failed to overcome the tyranny of distance,\u201d Cleary says. \u201cBetween now and 2061 we are going to grow the population by 15 million. Our plan is to build cities at scale connected by high-speed rail.\u201d Proponents say the \u201cvalue uplift\u201d of turning rural land into city and suburban blocks \u2013 generating billions for Clara \u2013 would more than cover the cost of the rail line, well north of $100bn, plus the estimated $5.5bn of infrastructure such as roads, water, waste services, schools and hospitals needed in each new city. It\u2019s a vision to transform the settlement patterns of Australia entrenched for more than 200 years. And all to be achieved by the private sector, with only minimal government involvement. \u201cHow do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time,\u201d Cleary says. But can Clara deliver on the vision? Too good to be true? The $8m given to Clara is for a business case for the first stage, a line between Melbourne and Shepparton, and two new cities at Nagambie and Shepparton. Clara\u2019s plan, which at this stage does not specify a technology, says it can cut the travel time between Melbourne and Shepparton from three hours to just 32 minutes. Too good to be true? An investigation by the Guardian has revealed that Clara has no office \u2013 its principal place of business, according to Asic records, is the office of its law firm, DLA Piper in Melbourne. It has just $422,000 in paid-up capital and so far has no major shareholders or directors with expertise in infrastructure projects, property development, construction or financing. Asic searches show a web of companies behind Clara, but the ultimate controlling shareholders are Cleary, his wife, Erin Cleary, and his assistant, Alexandra Johnson, who acts as Clara\u2019s contact point. Cleary says there is a separate consortium agreement and \u201cthere are a number of firms that are funding us while we pass those milestones\u201d of developing the business plan. He names the computer giant Cisco; the Japanese industrial company Hitachi; the urban planners Roberts Day and Clarke Hopkins Clarke; the consultant PWC; and DLA Piper. \u201cThere are 16 firms who have signed up to the Clara consortium,\u201d Cleary says. \u201cThey are part of Clara to deliver a strategic vision. Our financing is coming from large-scale institutional money down the track. We have to go through those milestones.\u201d He says a number of companies are providing in-kind support. DLA Piper acknowledged that the firm was doing work for Clara, but expressed surprise that it was listed as the consortium\u2019s principal place of business. Cleary also says he has secured some of the crucial land around the sites of the first two new cities. \u201cWe have some land in our control around those locations. It\u2019s around those areas, about 10km from Shepparton.\u201d But Clara has also had some setbacks. When it launched in 2016, its advisory board included several high-profile former politicians including the former Victorian premier Steve Bracks, the former NSW premier Barry O\u2019Farrell and the former federal trade minister Andrew Robb. Only Robb remains. Robb describes himself as an enthusiastic supporter. \u201cI think there will be a level of surprise about the comprehensive nature of the business plan,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be all taxpayer dollars. Governments are increasingly using value creation as a source of funding. Hong Kong hasn\u2019t spent any taxpayer funds on its underground. Instead it identifies where it will build stations and buys up the land, then builds the retail centres and apartments.\u201d The Melbourne wealth management company Newhaven was also involved, but its principal, Jay Grant, who served as the consortium\u2019s managing director, pulled out. So did some of the Americans Clara had approached, including a former US transport secretary, Ray LaHood. \u2018He had our hopes right up\u2019 The Guardian has also learned that many of the options Clara signed with landowners along the proposed route for the high-speed train have lapsed, leaving a bitter taste for farmers who were swept away by Cleary\u2019s promises of cities rising from the paddocks. Rather than put the line though the centre of Shepparton, a move likely to lead to objections, Cleary\u2019s plan involves finding the greenest of greenfield sites. He began securing land around the eight sites for proposed new cities in 2016. One is at Tallygaroopna, population 579, just north of Shepparton. The farmers who signed up with Cleary in 2017 thought they were on the cusp of a gold rush that would change their lives. But two years on Cleary has not been seen for months, and the options agreements have lapsed. Trevor Hosie, who has 120 hectares with \u201ca few sheep and cattle and a bit of irrigation\u201d says it was October or November when he last saw Cleary. Cleary and his offsider, Alex Johnson, brought teams of engineers and investors to visit the site, but last year the visits stopped, and no one in Tallygaroopna has seen Cleary for about eight months. \u201cI signed an agreement but it was all their way,\u201d Hosie says. \u201cThere was a three-month option, then another one, but then it ran out in October last year.\u201d He had been promised nearly $3m for his farm. Greig Buckland, a dairy farmer, is particularly aggrieved. \u201cWe signed up to it in 2016,\u201d Buckland says, having first spent money on lawyers. \u201cHe told me he\u2019d let me know when it was going public and he did call me the day before it was in the media. He was on TV saying they would be turning the first sod in 2018. But 12 months went by and nothing. I could have sold the dairy farm in that 12 months.\u201d He add: \u201cHe had our hopes right up there. I have tried ringing him many times but got nowhere.\u201d Other farmers, including Neville Moss of Glenara Angus Stud, were sceptical. Moss says he told Cleary: \u201cI\u2019ll sign when you hand over the money to one of the others.\u201d He is still waiting. Around Nagambie it\u2019s a similar story. Philip Deane, 65, signed up to sell his land, 8km north-east of the town. He went to the launch at RMIT and was excited by the vision outlined by Cleary and his associates, but especially by the $20m Cleary was offering for his farm. But the option has now lapsed, along with Deane\u2019s dreams of a comfortable retirement. His son, Wesley, has come back to run the farm. Cleary insists he still has options on land earmarked for the eight cities. \u2018We have not gone and assessed that\u2019 Cleary\u2019s background seems to have passed the Department of Infrastructure by when it funded him. Around the southern highlands, memories of Cleary\u2019s plan for developing dairy farms, his own included, are still raw. Several families lost money. Asic records show that the agricultural finance company CNH Capital filed to place him in bankruptcy in May 2010. Cleary sought to discharge the bankruptcy a year later but failed to provide written information about his property and income. He was discharged from bankruptcy in June 2013. In an excruciating session of Senate estimates last year the deputy secretary of the then Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities, Luke Yeaman, and the head of rail policy, Andrew Hyles, were forced to admit they were not aware of Cleary\u2019s bankruptcy or that Clara had just $422,700 in capitalisation. \u201cWe fundamentally assess the proposed project that was put in front of us by the company on the basis of the criteria that were in front of us,\u201d Yeaman said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go through a detailed assessment of the company\u2019s history,\u201d he said under questioning from the Labor senator Murray Watt. Watt then played his ace. \u201cWas the department aware that Mr Cleary is a longtime member of the National party, and that at one time he was even a vice-chairman of the New South Wales Nationals?\u201d Hyles said there were a range of partners with the company and that these were \u201cinternational firms\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re supporting Clara with their own in-kind contributions towards the work of building up this business case,\u201d he said. He said he was aware of Clara securing land options. \u201cWe have not gone and assessed that ourselves at this stage,\u201d Hyles said. Who the responsible minister was when Clara was chosen as frontrunner to build the most important infrastructure project of this century is less easy to say. Responsibility for fast rail is shared between the minister for infrastructure and transport and the minister responsible for cities \u2013 and the people occupying both jobs have changed regularly. Angus Taylor, who hails from Goulburn, has been an advocate for the Sydney-to-Melbourne fast rail, as it would go through his electorate. He was minister for cities at the time of the first call for submissions, which yielded 26 proposals, and he was still the minister during the process to whittle it down to a field of 13 which went on to stage two. The transport minister was Darren Chester, a National. But soon after the stage two bids were submitted in late November 2017, both portfolios changed. Barnaby Joyce became transport minister and Paul Fletcher became cities minister on 20 December. By February 2018 Joyce was dealing with more personal crises: revelations of his affair with his staffer Vikki Campion had come to light, costing him his marriage, the deputy prime minister\u2019s job and his portfolio. Campion by this time was working in the office of the Victorian Nationals MP Damien Drum, whose seat covers Shepparton and Tallygaroopna. By the time the winners were announced on 9 March 2018, the new Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, was transport minister, while Fletcher remained cities minister. \u201cThe whole assessment was considered by cabinet,\u201d Hyles told estimates. He said the three selected after stage two were top of the list the department recommended. Will bold plan impress government? Clara and the other two successful groups that shared the $20m are due to hand their business cases to the government imminently. The other two projects are more conventional and involve state governments and the private sector. They are an upgrade to the line between Sydney and Newcastle, proposed by the NSW government, and a proposal for faster rail between Brisbane and Nambour proposed by North Coast Connect, a consortium involving the property developer Stockland, the engineering firm SMEC and urban planners Urbis. The Queensland government is giving in-kind support. Whether Clara will again impress the bureaucrats with its bold plan remains to be seen. Theoretically, the value uplift model does not depend on government funding. But government support, both state and federal, would be essential to realise a 50-year plan crossing state boundaries. The government has left itself an exit strategy with Clara. \u201cThe Australian Government funding contribution to the Clara proposal is up to $8,000,000,\u201d its fact sheets on high-speed rail say. \u201cHowever, it should be noted that financial support for the development of a business case does not indicate Australian Government support for delivery of a project.\u201d The question is: would such a move set high-speed rail back another decade or more? \u2022 Next: How faster rail could change our cities Know more? anne.davies@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The former high court judge Michael Kirby believes it was a fluke that the world has avoided further nuclear weapons disasters since the second world war and has urged Australia to sign up to a weapon ban treaty. Kirby will launch a report in Sydney this week from the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which calls for Australia to get on board. Ican, which was founded in Melbourne, won the 2017 Nobel peace prize for leading the campaign for a global ban on nuclear weapons that resulted in a United Nations treaty being adopted in July 2017. Kirby seized on the 74th anniversaries this week of the US detonating two nuclear bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \u201cThat the world has survived seven decades since Hiroshima is more by good luck than effective management and there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so in an environment of proliferating nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. He acknowledged the nuclear weapons ban treaty was not perfect but \u201cdoing nothing is a far greater weakness\u201d. \u201cFailing to address the challenges of nuclear weapons to humanity, the safety of the planet and the biosphere, highlights the global community\u2019s failure to respond appropriately and effectively to the existential peril of nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. The nine nuclear powers, including the US, oppose the weapons ban treaty, arguing it could undermine nuclear deterrence. More than 120 countries voted for the UN treaty and so far 70 have formally signed up and 24 have ratified the agreement. The treaty comes into force once 50 countries have ratified, which is expected in 2020. Australia is not on the list. The federal government argues the ban treaty would not eliminate a single nuclear weapon. While Australia doesn\u2019t have any nuclear weapons, it relies on \u201cumbrella protection\u201d under the US alliance. Ican co-founder Dr Tilman Ruff said it is possible for Australia to keep its security pact with the US but sign the nuclear weapons treaty. He pointed out 11 of 17 of the US\u2019s regional allies have voted for the treaty\u2019s adoption and three have signed up, including New Zealand. \u201cFor none of those has there been any disruption or fuss with their ongoing military cooperation with the US,\u201d Ruff said. Ruff said if Australia was to sign up it would have to reconsider any nuclear weapons link to operations at joint facilities such as the satellite surveillance base Pine Gap in central Australia. The report suggests the relay ground station at Pine Gap\u2019s western compound would have to be closed or the US would have to separate out defensive functions from nuclear war-fighting. \u201cIt\u2019s one of multiple redundant channels,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that function of Pine Gap could easily be removed. Clearly this would need to be a negotiation, it would likely involve processes that would take a couple of years but we think that it\u2019s eminently doable,\u201d he said. The federal Labor conference last December adopted as party policy a binding resolution to sign and ratify the UN treaty to outlaw nuclear weapons. Anthony Albanese, who prosecuted that case at the conference, has as party leader reaffirmed his commitment. \u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of nuclear disarmament. It is something that I\u2019ve supported my entire political life,\u201d Albanese told the ABC Insiders program on Sunday. \u201cWe want to be a part of bringing the world with us. The fact is that over a period of time, issues like landmines and chemical weapons and other weapons have been outlawed, but nuclear weapons, the most catastrophic and damaging that can exist, still remain.\u201d In government ranks only Liberal MP Warren Entsch and Nationals MP Ken O\u2019Dowd have publicly backed Australia joining the weapon ban treaty. Meanwhile, Australian foreign affairs minister Marise Payne and defence minister Linda Reynolds met with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defence secretary Mark Esper in Sydney on Sunday for annual talks. Epser flagged on Saturday he supported placing ground-launched, intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific region in the short term. Asked if northern Australia could be a potential site, he declined to speculate, saying the US deployed systems globally with friends and allies with consent and respect for sovereignty. \u201cWe make decisions based on mutual benefit to each of the countries,\u201d he said. The US scrapped a nuclear arms pact with Russia on Friday. Both countries have pointed fingers at each other for violating the 1988 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty.",

The law as it relates to the front foot allows for only part of the foot to be behind the popping crease and the correct side of middle stump but no such allowance for the back foot on the return crease.

The next ball <strong>he carves through the covers for four!</strong> Loose from Broad, tight from Smith, perfectly controlled and he <strong>raises twin centuries in the match! His first match for a year and a half!<br></strong></p> <p>Who is this man? Is he a man? How is this possible? It shouldn\u2019t be. It can\u2019t be. But it is. He is calmer than in the first innings, but raises his bat and his arms in a long salute to the dressing room and the Australian fans down at the grandstand end of the ground. Then he waves to the Hollies Stand, and they all join in a chorus of some derisory song or other. It doesn\u2019t matter. There has only been one winner in that battle this match. Steven Smith, 144 and then 103 not out. Australia in control. He adds a single to cover before the over ends.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e34fc82179e9b8ade502feaefe612f9f34e5f0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e34fc82179e9b8ade502feaefe612f9f34e5f0a/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smith celebrates his century.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smith celebrates his century.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-04T12:54:09.073Z\">at 1.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d46d28f8f08c7e177d445c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-04T12:45:05.937Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>61st over: Australia 232-4 (Smith 99, Wade 15)</strong> Woakes to start to Smith.

Wade and the tail. No respite. But England also have no Anderson, and for one reason or another this session, no Woakes. Joe Denly has bowled seven overs, Moeen and Stokes a pile, after Broad used up all his petrol tickets in a fine early spell.

This contest is beautifully poised with Australia resuming their second innings leading by 34 runs with seven wickets in hand. </p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RicFinlay/status/1157844756912730113\">WinViz suggests</a> England have a 67% chance of victory, Australia just 23%, but I wonder if that takes into account the necessary Steve Smith loading. The Australian superstar will once again be at the crease when play resumes and England\u2019s bowlers seem bereft of ideas for how to prevent him remaining there indefinitely. </p> <p>With the pitch offering diminishing returns for the seamers and the Dukes ball failing to swing there will be enormous pressure on the shoulders of Moeen Ali to spin England to the brink of victory this morning. Should Australia bat on much beyond lunch the nerves around Edgbaston will be jangling loudly. A target in excess of 150 will be tricky to chase against an Australian attack containing Nathan Lyon on a surface offering plenty to the off-spinner.</p> <p>The opening couple of hours today look set to shape the remainder of the series. It\u2019s going to be gripping.</p> </div>   </div>",

Try Hoi An sports bar or Dirty Fingers in Da Nang. I live here - never struggled to find places. Thanks Tim.\u201d Only on the OBO. Join us tomorrow for the final act of a fascinating, fluctuating, infuriating contest. How special was that, Ian Ward asks Steve Smith. \u201cYeah, incredibly special,\u201d Smith replies. \u201cI was a little bit nervous, don\u2019t normally get nervous. I\u2019ve never scored two hundreds in a game in any form of cricket... The spine was tingling a bit. It did overcome me a bit [getting to the first hundred]. I love Test cricket and I love playing against England, it feels like Christmas every morning.\u201d 7th over: England 13-0 (Burns 7, Roy 6) Roy tucks Pattinson to square leg for a couple, then plays and misses as he gropes outside the off stump, but he survives and so does the new, suddenly authoritative Burns. Well played those openers, but the day belongs firmly to Australia, to the superhuman Steve Smith, and his excellent sidekick Matthew Wade. There have been 376 runs today, and if there are a few more than that tomorrow, England will have pulled off a miracle. Mid-7th over: England 11-0 (Burns 7, Roy 4) A second successive beauty as Pattinson starts the final over by angling one into Roy and jagging it away. Too good. 6th over: England 11-0 (Burns 7, Roy 4) Lyon continues to Roy, now with four men round the bat, and suddenly bowls a big booming outswinger. That\u2019s the new ball for you. Roy then shovels into the covers for a single. Lyon finds a much better ball for Burns, pitching near off and turning viciously, and Burns isn\u2019t quite good enough to edge it. 5th over: England 10-0 (Burns 7, Roy 3) Paine decides it\u2019s time to turn up the heat and replaces Siddle with Pattinson. Burns, tuned up by Siddle, keeps him out without difficulty. \u201cWell played Rory Burns,\u201d says Shane Warne. On Cric Viz, the bad news for the home fans is that England\u2019s chance of a win is 1 per cent; the good news is that the draw is favourite, on 53, with Australia on 46. 4th over: England 10-0 (Burns 7, Roy 3) Lyon is warming to the task. Roy stabs down on one that keeps low, then connects with fresh air as he shapes to cut. A better version of the same shot brings him two, before a dicey prod outside off yields an inside edge. Interesting times. 3rd over: England 8-0 (Burns 7, Roy 1) Burns, facing Siddle, punches another two past mid-on as he continues to ooze the confidence of the first-time centurion. Paine has three men saving one, which seems about three too many. 2nd over: England 6-0 (Burns 5, Roy 1) Yes, it\u2019s Lyon, and his first ball turns sharply. Roy watches it go past his off stump, then clips the second, which is similar but straighter, into the leg side. Burns, faced with four men round the bat, works to leg too, for a busy three, and Roy blocks the last three balls, reasonably solidly. These two old friends don\u2019t seem fazed by the size of the task. 1st over: England 2-0 (Burns 2, Roy 0) Rory Burns, eyeing his chance to bat on all five days of a Test, gets England going with a push into the covers. That was nice and firm, like a good parent, to paraphrase a line from the Pajama Men. And it\u2019s going to be Peter Siddle, perhaps because the other two seamers have just been batting. And Lyon from the other end? Something for the interval, from Mac Millings. \u201cFor all those England supporters - and especially my old pal of 30 years, Andy McDonald, who\u2019s at Edgbaston today for his first day of Test cricket in a very long time - please allow me to present my all-time Hope and Despair XI: Despair Haynes, Nick Knightmare, Dream Jones, Rohan Yes We Kanhai, Ian \u2018Beliefy\u2019 Botham, Irfantasy Pathan, Peter Impossiddle, Anguish Sodhi, Abandon Shai Hope, Moeen All Ye, Bishoo Devendra Here.\u201d One last swing for six from Pattinson, a wave from Tim Paine, and a clear imprint of Aussie boot on English face. England need 398 to win, and they will have to get through the first six or seven overs tonight, under the lights. There may be trouble ahead. Mid-112th over: Australia 479-7 (Pattinson 40, Cummins 25) A few more slogs off Denly, and it looks as if the declaration is imminent. Meanwhile, Eva Maaten has a theory. \u201cI suspect Steve Smith is waiting for Tim Paine to declare and Tim Paine is waiting for the signal from Steve Smith. This could go on for a while.\u201d 111st over: Australia 470-7 (Pattinson 40, Cummins 16) Maybe Paine is trying to hand Pattinson a first Test fifty. If so, it won\u2019t take long: Patto smites another six, stepping away to give Broad the sort of treatment he used to hand out himself. \u201cLoving the Guardian coverage,\u201d says Tom Willoughby. Thanks. \u201cEngland\u2019s one saving grace here is that Paine is being way over-conservative with the declaration... Am crossing my fingers that the rain materialises in some substance tomorrow and Burns\u2019s good run continues!\u201d Personally, I\u2019d place more faith in the Brummie weather than in a man who played and missed 40 times in the first innings. 110th over: Australia 460-7 (Pattinson 32, Cummins 15) Denly goes for a few ones and twos, and the Australians send out gloves and a drink \u2013 ie, a message. On the balcony, where someone is padded up, they seem in no hurry. \u201cEngland bowling collapses are different from our batting collapses,\u201d argues PS. \u201cThey reverse the order: we bat badly and then rally. We bowl well and then give it away by not having the killer instinct.\u201d 109th over: Australia 454-7 (Pattinson 31, Cummins 10) Cummins upper-cuts Broad and Burns gets another quarter-chance as he dashes in from third man. But this is academic now. Australia are 364 ahead and the only question is why they haven\u2019t declared already. Is Paine worried about what Jason Roy might do, in his second Test? 108th over: Australia 452-7 (Pattinson 29, Cummins 9) Joe Denly comes on and almost bags Pattinson as Rory Burns at midwicket makes a great effort to hold onto a near-impossible diving catch. \u201cGood chance, this, for Denly to get that first Test wicket,\u201d says Mike Atherton. Spoken like a fellow part-time leggie, with two wickets in his 115-Test career. 107th over: Australia 445-7 (Pattinson 28, Cummins 8) Pattinson, who is a handy slugger, helps himself to another six off Broad. The ball lands in somebody\u2019s beer. Joe Root sniffs it, warily, and succeeds in getting it changed \u2013 and using up a couple more minutes. 106th over: Australia 437-7 (Pattinson 21, Cummins 7) And now Pattinson slog-sweeps Moeen for six, prompting a moon ball, which is not Moeen\u2019s first of the day. \u201cPhil Sawyer is right,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI think we will eventually look back on the period from 14 July to 2 August 2019 as a golden period in English cricket history.\u201d 105th over: Australia 430-7 (Pattinson 15, Cummins 7) A decent first over back from Broad, but in this innings, unlike the first two, he\u2019s been the Broad of the past year, rather than his pomp. And that\u2019s drinks, with Australia still well on top. \u201cThis surprising (but not entirely unexpected) bowling collapse from England needs a radical rethink,\u201d says Harry Lang. \u201cFailing that, what\u2019s the Bat Signal for Archer? Is it too late to beam Wood into New Street? Is there a standby Harrier Jump Jet with Plunkett on board? Something! Anything?\u201d Cummins wafts at a short one from Broad, Bairstow half-appeals, Broad doesn\u2019t bother, Wilson says no, Root can\u2019t review \u2013 but it was, in fact, out. 104th over: Australia 426-7 (Pattinson 14, Cummins 4) Pattinson sweeps Moeen for four. The lead is now 336, which means England\u2019s only hope of winning is to try and get there in 50 overs. 103rd over: Australia 421-7 (Pattinson 10, Cummins 3) Normal service is resumed as Pattinson glides Stokes for four. Stokes responds by trotting off the field. \u201cRemember when we used to win the World Cup?\u201d says Phil Sawyer. \u201cThose were the days.\u201d 102nd over: Australia 415-7 (Pattinson 5, Cummins 2) Stranger things keep on happening. Moeen has bowled a maiden, to Cummins. \u201cEngland\u2019s only hope in this match is rain,\u201d says Gareth Edwards. \u201cWe need changes for the second Test. Out with Anderson, Moeen and Bairstow. In with Curran, Archer and Rashid.\u201d Agreed, one of England\u2019s mistakes here was not picking six bowlers. But I\u2019d have Leach right now, not Rashid. 101st over: Australia 415-7 (Pattinson 5, Cummins 2) Cummins fends at Stokes and offers a catch to short leg, where Jos Buttler... ducks. Either he misread it, or he\u2019s just not used to fieldng there, or both. In other news, Liverpool v Man City is going to penalties. Permission to join Rob Smyth here. 99th over: Australia 411-7 (Pattinson 2, Cummins 1) So Mo\u2019s figures are looking better in the final column, but still ugly in the middle two: 26-0-118-2. It\u2019s a collapse! Moeen bowls what Shane Warne calls \u201cthe perfect off-break\u201d \u2013 flighted, turning \u2013 and it squeezes through Paine\u2019s defences. The only trouble is, Nathan Lyon can bowl those all day long. 99th over: Australia 407-6 (Paine 33, Pattinson 0) I take it all back. Stokes now has two maidens in a row, as well as that wicket, and has bounced back strongly from his nadir of 15 minutes ago. \u201cI wonder,\u201d says Luke in Walsall, \u201cif Adil Rashid is even still watching?\u201d Ha. I suspect he wasn\u2019t considered fit for a five-day game, but it would have been worth having him in the squad just to cheer up his mate Moeen, who is right out of sorts. Matthew Wade, who only makes baby hundreds, picks out the man at deep square with unerring accuracy. And that\u2019s the end of the most fluent century in this match, a triumph not just for Wade, but for the Australian selectors. 98th over: Australia 407-5 (Wade 110, Paine 33) England are now struggling so badly that they\u2019re making Tim Paine look like a Test cricketer. As Moeen replaces Root, Paine reverse-sweeps for four, then laps for two. Missing, and England are out of reviews. Playing no stroke to Moeen, but it looks marginal. 97th over: Australia 400-5 (Wade 109, Paine 27) Stokes is still on too. Digging deep into his reserves of bloodymindedness, he tries bombing Paine, who does some swaying after gloving one, up in the air, but short of a lonely slip. That is at least a maiden, which is just what Matt Fordham ordered. \u201cIf Root doesn\u2019t want to be captain,\u201d sighs Felix Wood, \u201ccan he just say so, rather than desperately showing everyone that he\u2019s not up to the task?\u201d 96th over: Australia 400-5 (Wade 109, Paine 27) The landmarks are now arriving at the rate of two an over. Wade goes to his Test best as Australia cruise to 400. And Root is still on, presumably on the basis that everyone else is carrying an injury. \u201cSorry to repeat myself,\u201d says Matt Fordham, \u201cbut still wondering why England don\u2019t try and dry up the runs. Nothing to be gained by taking wickets now, so keeping Australia batting as long as possible is the only priority. Whilst performing some kind of rain dance.\u201d 95th over: Australia 393-5 (Wade 104, Paine 25) Stokes bounces Wade, who swats him serenely for four. So often he gets the breakthrough, but Stokes has been poor in this spell, conceding 26 off three overs. The lead is 300 now, and England\u2019s chances of winning are about the same as those of an orderly Brexit. \u201cIt occurs to me,\u201d says Brian Withington, \u201cthat Australia\u2019s jauntily unbecoming second-innings run rate has really done the damage to England\u2019s prospects. If they had been scoring at England\u2019s more sedate \u2018Test match appropriate\u2019 rate then we might now still be daring to dream (with our bosom chum despair to come later, of course).\u201d Wasn\u2019t it only a few days ago that we were despairing of England\u2019s inability to score at a Test-match rate? 94th over: Australia 386-5 (Wade 100, Paine 22) These two have even eased past the fifty partnership \u2013 55 off only 8.5 overs. Root needs to take himself off now. Wade, facing Root, pulls out the reverse sweep again, gets it past short third man and reaches the fourth hundred of the match, the first by a batsman who is not wildly unorthodox, and the first that has felt effortless. 93rd over: Australia 379-5 (Wade 95, Paine 21) The runs continue to flow off Stokes, whose latest long hop is flayed by Wade for four. \u201cHey Timmy,\u201d says Sarah Helsham. \u201cReading from Hoi An, Vietnam.\u201d Nice. \u201cLoving the commentary, can\u2019t watch, no cricket in Vietnam. Aussie girl with her English boyfriend - first 2 days were unbearable for me, but haven\u2019t we turned a corner. And now Shaun is very quiet. Steve Smith you absolute legend!!!!!! PS it\u2019s my birthday.\u201d Many happy returns, but maybe you and Shaun need to have a non-gloating pact. 92nd over: Australia 372-5 (Wade 88, Paine 20) Order is restored by Root, who has now bowled ten overs. The trouble is, it\u2019s a vote of no confidence in Moeen. \u201cMay I make a pitch,\u201d asks a very polite Damian Clarke, \u201cto better Mr Ali\u2019s most Guardian email of the day? [90th over] I\u2019m wondering what Phoebe Waller-Bridge thinks of Joe Root\u2019s on-field decisions.\u201d 91st over: Australia 370-5 (Wade 87, Paine 19) It wasn\u2019t about a change of ends: the nearly new ball is now being shared by Root and Ben Stokes, captain and vice-captain. Paine \u2013 nominal captain, actually more of a vice-captain \u2013 treats him with contempt, upper-cutting for six and straight-pushing the next ball for four. Paine\u2019s in a hurry because showers are forecast for this evening. \u201cWhy am I having difficulty,\u201d asks Ron Mallon, \u201cin seeing England at 200 for 4 at this time tomorrow?\u201d 90th over: Australia 359-5 (Wade 87, Paine 9) Joe Root, perhaps smarting from Patrick\u2019s appraisal (88th over), springs a surprise by giving the sixth over with the new ball to... himself. Maybe just a way of switching ends for Broad and Woakes. The Australians are watchful, except in their running: another half-chance goes begging as Jason Roy misses with a shy from midwicket. \u201cConcerning Smith\u2019s \u2018issue\u2019 of falling in the 140s (over 85),\u201d says Jason Ali, \u201cperhaps his problem is that his brain functions with a Base 15 number system. His current innings of 142 equates to 97; his previous one of 144 converts to 99.\u201d Jason, the prize for the most Guardian email of the day is yours. And here\u2019s Guy Hornsby. \u201cI wonder how long the misplaced hope will last when England bat?\u201d he muses. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been here before, of course, &amp; miracles do happen, but if Burns can\u2019t follow Smith, where do the bat-all-day-heroics reside? My hopes-dashed timestamp is currently set to 12:45pm, when Root\u2019s out.\u201d At least you\u2019re not going for tonight. 89th over: Australia 356-5 (Wade 86, Paine 7) Broad tries to get Paine the same way he did in the first innings, suckered into a pull, but this time Paine keeps it down, takes a single, and there\u2019s an exchange of knowing smiles. Last ball, Broad strays down leg and Wade cashes in with a glance for four. And that\u2019s tea, with Australia 266 ahead and laughing all the way to the scones. On Twitter, there\u2019s a good line from Rory Dollard. \u201cThe top banter now,\u201d he reckons, \u201cwould be Steve Smith waving in Paine for the declaration.\u201d 88th over: Australia 349-5 (Wade 81, Paine 5) Woakes is getting movement, as usual, and the only runs are two off Wade\u2019s inside edge \u2013 until Woakes tries a slower ball, Wade picks it and pushes it back, easy as you like, for four. \u201cI\u2019ve feared for England ever since they could not knock over Australia\u2019s last two wickets.\u201d says Patrick Phillips. \u201cThen, and again now, we see no sign of captaincy. Just chuntering on. Why not move the field about, have the bowlers try something different. Appear busy &amp; keep the batsmen thinking. All the captain seems to do is change the bowlers and sit and wait. When two batsmen are in, that can be a long wait. Even get the bowlers to bowl defensively. England needed Australian still to be batting tomorrow if not all out. Now England will be in this evening and could be all out before lunch tomorrow.\u201d Interesting. To my eye, Root has tried quite a lot of things in this match \u2013 six bowlers, funky fields, plan B, C and D. But I\u2019d agree that Root isn\u2019t a natural captain. 87th over: Australia 343-5 (Wade 75, Paine 5) Wade\u2019s not bothered about losing Smith: he just plays another of those crunching cover drives, off Broad this time. \u201cAm I sick? Drunk? High?\u201d wonders Damian Clarke. \u201cI\u2019ve just heard Geoff Boycott\u2019s theory on Australia getting all out soon, and leaving England a tantalising target to encourage going for it. And I find myself agreeing... with Boycott! Blimey.\u201d 86th over: Australia 337-5 (Wade 70, Paine 5) So Chris Woakes lands the big one, but let\u2019s give Stuart Broad some credit too, for changing the mood. Tim Paine comes out and is immediately purposeful, stroking a couple of twos and running straight down the pitch, for which he is quite rightly ticked off. Mate, it\u2019s doing enough already. Smith chases a wide one and Bairstow takes a fine tumbling catch. It\u2019s the end of a fabulous innings \u2013 and now England know where Smith\u2019s Achilles heel lies: in the nervous 140s. 85th over: Australia 330-4 (Smith 142, Wade 69) England desperately need a game-changer and Broad gets them part of the way there. The non-LBW rouses the crowd, who had been silenced by the Smith masterclass. Way too high. That\u2019s another howler from Joel Wilson. Here is the new ball, and Broad gets Wade LBW, but it\u2019s high... 84th over: Australia 329-4 (Smith 141, Wade 69) Smith tickles Root fine for four, as you would too, if you were finding life absurdly easy out there. Time for the new ball, surely. 83rd over: Australia 322-4 (Smith 135, Wade 68) Moeen drops short and Wade mullahs him over midwicket. Jack Leach, this could be your chance to get on that Lord\u2019s honour board. \u201cSome things for Ed Smith and James Taylor to do after the Test,\u201d says Dave Seare. \u201c1 Go to Holland and study the defensive capabilities of windmills vis-a-vis playing the moving ball early doors. This will provide data for troubling Steve Smith. 2 Teach the team how to blag one of those extra new balls around 60 overs in. 3 Don\u2019t get drunk the night before the Lord\u2019s Test and pick a ten-man team.\u201d Harsh, but entertaining. 82nd over: Australia 315-4 (Smith 133, Wade 63) It\u2019s miserable being the fielding captain in a situation like this, but you do have to observe the basics. Wade calls for a tight second, Joe Denly fires in an exemplary throw, and Smith would be out if Joe Root had got behind the stumps. It never rains... 81st over: Australia 312-4 (Smith 132, Wade 61) Decent from Moeen again, but he still has figures of 23-0-98-1 on a surface that\u2019s turning big. England are missing Jack Leach. 80th over: Australia 309-4 (Smith 131, Wade 59) Root bamboozles Wade again, drawing the edge, but Sod\u2019s Law sees to it that the nick goes wide of Stokes at slip and all the way to the boundary. \u201cViewed from the jaundiced perspective of a despairing English fan,\u201d says Brian Withington, promisingly, \u201cSteve Smith is taking on the appearance of one of JK Rowling\u2019s dementors with his uncanny ability to suck all the joy and hope from our minds. And we are completely stuck without our patronus in chief, Jimmy Anderson, riding to the rescue.\u201d That\u2019s the spirit. 79th over: Australia 305-4 (Smith 131, Wade 55) Moeen comes close to emulating Root, but five dots are accompanied by a straight thud from Smith for two. 78th over: Australia 303-4 (Smith 129, Wade 55) It\u2019s off spin from both ends at the moment, and the greater threat is coming from Joe Root. He rips a classic off-break (or leg-break to the left-hander) past Wade\u2019s prod, and even manages a maiden. A moral victory. 77th over: Australia 303-4 (Smith 129, Wade 55) Moeen\u2019s bowling, so strong since his recall, is now going the way of his batting. He\u2019s reached the point where it\u2019s a minor triumph when an over goes for only three. 76th over: Australia 300-4 (Smith 128, Wade 53) Smith has been so dominant that it\u2019s easy to miss the part played by his accomplices. The award for Best Supporting Actor was going to Travis Head, but now Matthew Wade has matched him for runs, and added some swagger. He reaches a very fine/bloody frustrating fifty with a reverse sweep off Joe Root. And the Australians cruise to 300. Thanks Geoff, and good on you for not gloating. Cricket\u2019s eternal question, so often unanswerable, is a piece of cake right now. Who\u2019s winning? Steve Smith. 75th over: Australia 293-4 (Smith 127, Wade 47) Smith knocks a single to backward square to take that lead to a round 200. Wade has a couple of streaky shots against Moeen, one turning past the outside edge, one taking the edge onto the ground for one. Mo stays around the wicket to Smith, who is hit on the pad as the ball straightens down the line, and Bairstow wants the review. In fact the ball did more than straighten, says HawkEye, it turned so far it was missing leg stump entirely. Smith remains! Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair. Drinks. And stumps for me. Thanks for all your emails, sorry that I couldn\u2019t get to most of them. It\u2019s peak hour on the Ashes OBO. Tim de Lisle will be your driver for the rest of the day. Treat him with courtesy, and tip big. Cheerio. 74th over: Australia 289-4 (Smith 124, Wade 46) No fear for Wade punching against Denly\u2019s turn out of the rough through cover. He does it twice in the over, once for three and once for four. The lead is 199! 73rd over: Australia 281-4 (Smith 124, Wade 39) Some internal counter in Smith\u2019s head has clicked over to \u201ctime to go\u201d. He pushes outside off stump at Moeen, deflecting the ball past slip on the bounce. I think there was a measure of purpose to that. Then he skips down and batters the ball over midwicket for four more! Huge gap out there and Smith took it. 11 from the over. England have no solution. Stokes? Someone has to dig deep. 72nd over: Australia 270-4 (Smith 115, Wade 37) The runs flowing. The lead goes to 180 as Wade reverses again, from outside off against Denly, for four through third man. England are seeing this Test slip away. 71st over: Australia 265-4 (Smith 115, Wade 32) The famed Edgbaston double-spin attack. Moeen to partner Denly. Four singles from the over. \u201cI think you landed on the correct explanation (58th over) for the goodness of Stokes\u2019 delivery to dismiss Head,\u201d writes Timothy. \u201cAs you say, the Laws state: \u201821.5.1 the bowler\u2019s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to his/her stated mode of delivery\u2019, and the ICC playing regulations for Tests say the same. \u201cThe no-ball law has been about where the feet land, not where they are when the ball is delivered - hence the \u2018dragging\u2019 that used to go on under the old back-foot law; and hence DRS replays always look at the landing of the feet before moving on to the business end of the pitch. That\u2019s good practical sense, because an umpire can\u2019t carry on looking at a bowler\u2019s feet for too long.\u201d 70th over: Australia 261-4 (Smith 113, Wade 30) Now Smith is pulling out the reverse-sweep. Denly goes for three singles from the over, one of them more dramatic than the others. 69th over: Australia 258-4 (Smith 111, Wade 29) Wade is doing exactly what he was brought in to do: get the game moving from No.6. Another boundary as he works Woakes away through fine leg. The bowlers can\u2019t settle because they know he\u2019s looking to score fast. Interesting thought from Geoff Wignall on Stokes and Head: \u201cI\u2019d say it was a no-ball, Geoff. The law as it relates to the front foot allows for only part of the foot to be behind the popping crease and the correct side of middle stump but no such allowance for the back foot on the return crease. Presumably as the legal part of the front foot can be in the air, so can the illegal part of the back foot, prior to landing in an illegal position.\u201d 68th over: Australia 253-4 (Smith 110, Wade 25) You can\u2019t imagine that any England plan had Joe Denly bowling this much. He replaced Broad after that brief foray, and bowls a short ball for Smith to pull a single, then has Wade reverse-sweeping over the keeper for two runs. Fun stuff. 67th over: Australia 250-4 (Smith 109, Wade 23) Both batsmen are being much more careful against Woakes than Broad. They recognise his danger, with the ball... not exactly talking, but muttering in its sleep. A couple of singles, then Woakes angles one in past Wade\u2019s bat and gives it the big ones with an appeal, but that looked like an inside edge. 66th over: Australia 248-4 (Smith 108, Wade 22) A single early against Broad for Wade, and Smith is not going to be so circumspect. He drives, hard, all bottom-hand whip, straight of mid-on for four. Then tries for another behind point, but finds the field on this occasion. 65th over: Australia 243-4 (Smith 104, Wade 21) Happy to take it easy is Wade against Woakes. Leaves the first half of the over alone. Defends a couple on the stumps. Only when Woakes drops short does he play, pulling crisply for a single to the sweeper. 64th over: Australia 242-4 (Smith 104, Wade 20) Lovely, Steve Smith is getting out the party-trick leaves now. The one where he comes over the ball and then whips around in a semi-circle as if to make sure it hasn\u2019t changed its mind and started sneaking up behind him. Maiden. 63rd over: Australia 242-4 (Smith 104, Wade 20) Matt Wade, stocky short left-hander, is trying to balance defence and attack. Doing it well so far. Leaves and blocks most of Woakes\u2019 over, but identifies the width he wants to go after, carving it square for four. 62nd over: Australia 238-4 (Smith 104, Wade 16) Broad with the ball from the City End. Can he take Ashes wicket 102? Not with a ball nine feet outside off stump, that Smith glances at like he might a smear of street ordure on his shoe. The next ball he carves through the covers for four! Loose from Broad, tight from Smith, perfectly controlled and he raises twin centuries in the match! His first match for a year and a half! Who is this man? Is he a man? How is this possible? It shouldn\u2019t be. It can\u2019t be. But it is. He is calmer than in the first innings, but raises his bat and his arms in a long salute to the dressing room and the Australian fans down at the grandstand end of the ground. Then he waves to the Hollies Stand, and they all join in a chorus of some derisory song or other. It doesn\u2019t matter. There has only been one winner in that battle this match. Steven Smith, 144 and then 103 not out. Australia in control. He adds a single to cover before the over ends. 61st over: Australia 232-4 (Smith 99, Wade 15) Woakes to start to Smith. On the pads, glanced fine for a single. Smith on to 99... Wade on strike now. Woakes full and seems to get a tiny bit of shape into the pads. Blocked. Again with some shape just outside off. A hint of it. Blocked away. Two slips, gully set deep for a full-blooded shot. Short cover and regulation cover. A heap of seam movement from a wide ball takes it almost to first slip for the left-hander. Mid-off, mid-on, midwicket, long leg. Wade leaves a ball angled across him. Hands clap, encouragements are shouted. On the pads. Wade covers up. The lead is 142. Here we go after lunch. Chris Woakes has the ball after not bowling at all in the first session. I have as many questions as you do. Thanks to those of you who\u2019ve sent this in. Sequel to my book. We said it at the start of the day. If England got Smith early, they had the match. If Smith batted a couple of hours, they probably wouldn\u2019t. And here we are, with the maestro set to return after a sanger with yet another century within his grasp, and the lead growing. Even if they got bowled out in a massive collapse Australia would have enough to make the chase uncomfortable. If they can push on anywhere past 200, it will start tilting towards the impossible. England desperately need a lift. Wickets, fast. Smith before he can settle after the break. Wade and the tail. No respite. But England also have no Anderson, and for one reason or another this session, no Woakes. Joe Denly has bowled seven overs, Moeen and Stokes a pile, after Broad used up all his petrol tickets in a fine early spell. Yet all England have to show for it is the eventual wicket of Head after a half-century. Match on the line now. I\u2019ll be back once I\u2019ve freshly supplied the temple that is my body. 60th over: Australia 231-4 (Smith 98, Wade 15) One over to lunch, with Moeen bowling and Smith on 97. He\u2019d like the hundred but he\u2019s not a nervous enough character to worry about doing anything out of the ordinary to get there. He drives once straight to cover, once to the bowler, and in the end settles for a single from the last ball to keep the strike. Unbeaten on 98 as he walks off! Huge applause for Australia\u2019s comeback kid. 59th over: Australia 230-4 (Smith 97, Wade 15) He\u2019s in touch, Wade! Got a beauty in the first innings on 1, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him today. Crisply flicks Stokes through midwicket for four, then blots out of the over so that Smith can have strike. \u201cAm I missing something? I\u2019ve dug back through the OBO and I can\u2019t see a thing. Why on earth has Chris of house Woakes not bowled this morning? Niggle? I\u2019m confused, please send help.\u201d Sam, apparently Woakes spoke to Phil Tufnell this morning and said he was fine, but there are also rumours of an injury. I\u2019ve asked the ECB and they say nothing to their knowledge, but we\u2019ll follow up during lunch. 58th over: Australia 226-4 (Smith 97, Wade 11) Another cover-drive banged away from Denly for four, then Wade denies Smith the strike with a late single. Ok, I think I\u2019ve cracked it. The very outside of the front of Stokes\u2019 shoe lands within the return crease, then the rest of the shoe lands over it. So if you count the first contact as \u201clands\u201d, then it hasn\u2019t broken the return crease (yet). So, not a no ball. Maybe? I don\u2019t know. Who\u2019d be an umpire? 57th over: Australia 221-4 (Smith 97, Wade 6) Another no-ball from Stokes, another brace for Smith. I\u2019m watching a million replays of Stokes\u2019 foot from the last over, bear with me. \u201cThanks to Gaurish Chawla for that thought-provoking email in the 45th over,\u201d writes Timothy Sanders. \u201cI can only plead for understanding that so many English folk can\u2019t get their heads around the way the world is, and are desperately seeking a reference point to make sense of things. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve been eating with a fork their whole lives and someone\u2019s given them a bowl of soup; or they\u2019re Ian Bell trying to pick Shane Warne\u2019s slider.\u201d 56th over: Australia 218-4 (Smith 95, Wade 6) Another single flicked by Smith from Denly. Matthew Wade gets off the mark with a cover-driven four! Australia growing in confidence. He nearly drags onto his stumps off his arm with a sweep shot, before nailing another sweep for two between the fielders in the deep behind square. The third umpire is Chris Gaffaney. Was he going by the old back-foot Law, where the foot could cut the line? The current Laws and the ICC conditions are very clear that the back foot cannot touch the return crease. Stokes was halfway over it. 55th over: Australia 211-4 (Smith 94, Wade 0) Smith facing stokes, and that is an absolute beauty of a shot. Sees some width, leans onto his back foot, opens the blade and punches through cover for four! Imperious. Degree of difficulty, off the charts. Demeanour, casual. Then a single to move within one big hit of twin centuries in this match. The lead: 122. Now, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but on that replay Stokes bowled a back-foot no-ball to get Head out. His back foot cut the return crease in half, around the wicket to the left-hander. The third umpire looked at the front foot, but hasn\u2019t noticed the back foot. Am I barking up the wrong tree? 54th over: Australia 206-4 (Smith 89, Wade 0) Smith is happy to spare Wade facing a leg-spinner out of the left-hander\u2019s rough to start his day. Blocks out five balls of the over before dancing to the sixth and driving a run through midwicket. 53rd over: Australia 205-4 (Smith 88) Just a Smith single from the over before Head is chopped off by the last ball. England missed several tricks. Head looked hopeless against the full straight ball, but they kept bowling short outside off to him and he profited before his eventual undoing. Matthew Wade is in next. Finally, the weight of numbers tells! Head plays that cut shot one too many times and Stokes gets his man. Thick top edge through to the keeper. Head has gambled and fallen, but Head has made an absolutely vital half century to take Australia to 115 in front! 52nd over: Australia 204-3 (Smith 87, Head 51) Denly carries on, and oh dear. Loses that good length he\u2019s been working on, not once but twice bowling full tosses. Not once but twice, Smith flicks them for four. Denly starts landing balls in the rough and turning them large into Smith\u2019s pads. Smith is happy to block from the crease, before skipping down to flick a single to keep the strike. Peter Salmon splashes into my emails. \u201cSounds an obvious thing, but a friend pointed out to me recently that the thing about Smith is he either defends, leaves, or hits the ball into a gap. He never hits to a fielder. Move a fielder, he changes where he hits it. I\u2019ve become obsessed watching for it, and it\u2019s 99% true. I think that might be what is unique about him when we are trying to find what sets him apart. Doesn\u2019t help anyone get him out of course.\u201d 51st over: Australia 195-3 (Smith 78, Head 51) Smith keeps Smithing, all day long. Walks across his stumps, nudges a single to leg. Rinse, repeat. Head keeps Heading, all day long. Close to off stump, trying to scythe with an angled bat. Straight to point once again. It looks so dicey. Then he finally nails one, further behind point for four! Why must he bat in such terrifying style? Still, as Homer said, \u201cIt means he gets results, you stupid chief!\u201d No, the other Homer. 50th over: Australia 190-3 (Smith 77, Head 47) Oh, now a missed stumping! Denly is bowling well, folks. He gets a ball to land in the rough and skid straight on past Head\u2019s bat, and Head\u2019s foot is dragged out of the crease trying to cover the line! But the ball is so zippy it cannons back off Bairstow\u2019s pads rather than nestling into his gloves. Oof. Head gets off strike with a sweep. Smith steps across and nudges past short leg. The Australian lead is 100! 49th over: Australia 187-3 (Smith 75, Head 46) Another run for Australia as Stokes oversteps. Wides, beamers, England\u2019s bowlers have been ragged this morning. And ragged with a short wide ball that Smith doesn\u2019t even have to cut, he just holds his bat almost in its backlift and opens the face to guide the shot through gully for four. Just the one slip for Smith now, with a backward point, cover point, mid-off, mid-on, midwicket, deep square leg, backward square leg, and long leg. Smith gets width again and punches another boundary between the two points. Stokes loses his rag completely and bowls short a mile down leg. Gets away with it. That\u2019s one way to avoid being smacked through the posh side. He bowls there again, not so short though, and it nearly works! Smith is nearly caught! He flicks it off his hip, and I think it was Jason Roy at backward square, diving away to his right, but the ball flies fine of him and down to the deep for one run. Phew. Ten from the over, nearly the wicket. 48th over: Australia 177-3 (Smith 67, Head 46) Denly draws a false shot now! Smith moves back to the ball, trying to work it to the leg side, ends up squeezing it through his own legs and away behind square. The crowd gets very excited as Denly bowls to Head, who clobbers a sweep shot straight into the short leg catcher. Also speaking of TMS, Jim Maxwell has been getting a lot of love as he tours around for the Ashes at 69 years of age. Click through for an interesting Adam Collins bit about Jim\u2019s first shot in England, at the 1983 World Cup. Speaking of Test Match Special, notwithstanding Gaurish\u2019s email, I suppose this is the time of day when I ask someone to give me the overseas listening link so that I can give you the overseas listening link. It\u2019s the circle of links. \u201cMorning Geoff,\u201d chirps Grif. \u201cWhen can we play our \u2018open the box of banana balls\u2019 card? Is it now? I hope it\u2019s now.\u201d Banana balls? Sounds like an especially unpleasant ailment in the tropical theatres of World War II. 47th over: Australia 176-3 (Smith 66, Head 46) Stokes loses control completely, that was the reverse Harmison. Miles outside leg stump, and he\u2019s lucky that Bairstow is nimble enough to collect the ball. It\u2019s called wide, which is quite a feat in a Test match. Another ball too close to leg stump is glanced by Head for a couple, and that raises the century stand! Huge for Australia, the lead is now 86. And the pitch still looks decent to bat on now that they\u2019ve settled in. That\u2019s drinks. 46th over: Australia 173-3 (Smith 66, Head 44) Joe Denly on for some leggies. And they\u2019re decent! Lands them nicely aside from a short one that he gets away with. Three singles and a bye. 45th over: Australia 169-3 (Smith 64, Head 43) A change for Broad at last, with Ben Stokes coming on. Mostly full and at the stumps, though there\u2019s one wide trash ball that Head pelts straight to the field. Interesting email from Gaurish Chawla. \u201cThank you for your lovely live blog, that I read with great interest and that unfolds like a great piece of non fiction memoir with cricket itself playing the protagonist. Often this is more enjoyable than the TV coverage of gambling companies interspersed with some cricket. \u201cI do time to time listen to the BBC radio commentary as well and am very much annoyed at the colonial references that keep being thrown around. Yesterday an email was read out that spoke about \u201csending someone back to the colonies\u201d. As a man hailing from an ex-colony (now freed, even if still within the clutches of neocolonial structures), I am disturbed at the way my country of birth is spoken about. \u201cDuring the World Cup, there was a lot of asking why people of subcontinental origin raised in Britain still support subcontinental sides. For me, it\u2019s the unexamined structural colonialism of cricket discourse. In my local pub the punters kept shouting \u2018Come on Geoffrey! Do it for the Mother Country,\u2019 whenever Jofra Archer was on screen, and I have rarely felt so upset and angry while watching cricket. Would they say the same for Jo Konta or Ben Stokes?\u201d 44th over: Australia 169-3 (Smith 64, Head 43) That\u2019s better from Head! He picks up that Moeen has overpitched, gets down the track in a flash to make it a proper full toss, and drives it straight down the ground for four! Not overhitting, along the carpet and controlled. Then as Moeen dials back the length, Head does get a ball to cut for a single. 43rd over: Australia 163-3 (Smith 63, Head 38) Still playing those cut shots at balls too close to his body, Travis Head. Another dicey miss against Broad as it beats the top edge. A brace through cover is the only scoring shot from the over. \u201cThe bowling so far has shown we miss Jimmy not just for his wickets, but his ability to build pressure\u201d writes Chris Davis. \u201cWe\u2019ve not bowled badly this morning but there are too many balls that release the pressure.\u201d 42nd over: Australia 161-3 (Smith 63, Head 36) The milking continues, and Smith goes up past his Test match average with 63. First he forces Moeen away through the off side, then drags him down to fine leg, then pushes a run to point. 41st over: Australia 155-3 (Smith 58, Head 35) Broad suddenly loses his line. Down leg side to Head, who plays a simple glance away for four. Then fuller on the same line, and Head goes through midwicket for another! See what I mean? He\u2019s suddenly up to 35. Here\u2019s Brian Withington. \u201cMuch discussion on Sky this morning about how on earth you get Steve Smith out, and some brief allusion to the Bradman dilemma that faced DR Jardine and co back in the day. Looking at the CricViz analysis of Smith\u2019s average by zone (sadly not available for The Don in 1932/3) it seems quite clear that the rule about fielders behind square on the leg side needs to revert to its 1932 laissez faire condition. And Jofra Archer cast as the Harold Larwood for our times? Can\u2019t wait for the telegrams/tweets from Canberra to Downing Street...\u201d On my understanding of our twinned politics, PM Morrison will telegram \u201cHow good is Straya!\u201d and PM Johnson will be taking to hospital after rolling up the paper slip and jamming it into his ear. 40th over: Australia 147-3 (Smith 58, Head 27) Moeen Ali to Travis Head, who is trying to be proactive and shift his weight in the crease, even when blocking or leaving. He still can\u2019t help playing one Travis Head shot though, leaning back and trying to carve a ball that was too close and too fast, missing it entirely. Head always looks like he\u2019s about to get out, but more often than not he has a stack of runs to his name by the time that happens. Don\u2019t blink. Gets a single from the last ball. 39th over: Australia 146-3 (Smith 58, Head 26) Smith just keeps doing what Smith does: stepping across, nullifying the line of the ball, blocking it back, finding a single. But Broad is good enough, once in this over, to land it a fraction wider, get a fraction of movement, and beat the edge! Smith may not get out very often, but when he does get out he nicks off to slip like everyone else. 38th over: Australia 144-3 (Smith 57, Head 25) Travis Head is starting to settle, and they play Moeen in one-day middle-overs mould. Single, singles, four of them in total. Milk and bilk. Robert Grey emails in, bravely. \u201cI was in the Hollies yesterday and have now just landed in Stockholm (bringing the hangover with me). I fear the missing strike bowler in our attack is a fatal flaw in this Test. Let\u2019s just please build some genuine pressure against Smith. How about posting the hives, tic-tic-boom to wrap this email up nicely?\u201d Rob, the hives are what I have after watching Rory Burns bat. 37th over: Australia 140-3 (Smith 55, Head 23) Broad is bowling really well to Smith, full around off stump, forcing defensive shots but with just a length just short enough to move the ball after pitching. Smith waits on a couple, and then, wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles, plays a false shot! What was trying to do there? He whipped his wrists through a relatively full ball, and I think he may have been trying to get that to the leg side? Instead it took a leading edge and went airborne through cover, into the gap between cover and mid-off! We can\u2019t examine the shot more closely because the TV is content to show 83 replays of England players with their hands on their heads. Great content. The lead is 50. Whoah, Jimmy Jimmy has instead become Woe Jimmy Jimmy. No surprises here, but he officially won\u2019t bowl again in this match. 36th over: Australia 136-3 (Smith 51, Head 23) Right, Smith might have solved the Broad strike problem for now. Gets a single from Moeen fourth ball. The off-spinner then shreds one out of the left-hander\u2019s rough to beat Head\u2019s outside edge, then keep low through Bairstow\u2019s legs for four byes. Nothing to see here, spinners. Nothing to see. Australia lead by 46 and Lyon might defend that, at this rate. Kim Thonger emails in \u201cIn all the talk about finding a way to get Smith out, we\u2019re forgetting the thorn in our side that is Peter Siddle. I\u2019ve got a shiny 50p piece on him getting the Aussies up to a 200+ lead even if we bag Smith for not much early on.\u201d 35th over: Australia 131-3 (Smith 50, Head 23) Broad to Smith, and he just wheels the bat around like hands on a clock face and effortless eases the ball behind point for his 50th run. His hundred in the first innings drew him level: 24 tons and 24 fifties. Now he\u2019s on to 25 fifties, but could invert that if he converts it. Stats, hey? The problem with that single is that it brings Head back on strike to Broad, which is a Bad Idea officially for Australia. Head responds to the doubters by playing a horrendous diagonal heave at a ball outside off, all bottom hand. That\u2019s exactly how to play good seam bowling on an English deck, lad. 34th over: Australia 130-3 (Smith 49, Head 23) Moeen recovers from his carnival sideshow of a first over and lands quite nicely on the spot for his second. Spins one off a thick inside edge from Smith away into the leg side. England need Mo to do a job today. 33rd over: Australia 129-3 (Smith 48, Head 23) Thanks JP! Geoff Lemon here, taking over as play gets underway. Good morning all. Adjust your email and Twitter settings accordingly if you wouldn\u2019t mind. Tim Paine could probably repurpose some Churchill today: \u201cNever have so many relied so heavily on so few,\u201d or thereabouts. By which I mean to say, never have I felt that an Ashes Test has relied so entirely on one player. If England get Smith this morning, they win. If they don\u2019t for two or three hours, they lose. Stuart Broad \u2013 big, bad, and better than his Dad \u2013 starts his day against Travis Head, left-handed and flighty. Sears the ball in from around the wicket and there\u2019s a huge shout! That was hitting leg stump, surely! Umpire says no. Computer says maybe. Clipping leg. I was giving it. I\u2019m still giving it. England didn\u2019t review. It wouldn\u2019t have been out, but phew. Close. Another shout next ball! This one missing leg properly. But Head can\u2019t get bat on it when Broad bowls full and straight. So Broad bowls short and wide instead. There is a galaxy within; you will never understand his mysteries. 32nd over: Australia 129-3 (Smith 48, Head 23) My oh my oh my... Moeen Ali begins proceedings and his first ball is a rancid grubber that pitches and scuttles no more than ankle high towards Smith who is alert enough to nurdle a single. After Head calmly rotates strike Ali then sends down a wild lobbed grenade that beats Smith at head height for an awful no-ball. Smith tried to swat it away but failed to connect. An eventful start to the day. The players are out in the middle and day four is underway! Australian TV is broadcasting a pre-recorded interview with Travis Head and the man who will start play in partnership with Steve Smith has said Australia are targeting a lead of 250-plus. The strategy is to see off the opening hour or so and then cash-in once the ball has softened. Are we remiss for not considering Joe Denly\u2019s leg-spin as a serious factor in the outcome of this match? After all, he was selected in touring parties for his ability to operate as an auxiliary member of the attack on decks such as these. How do you solve a problem like Steve Smith? Mark Taylor, on Australian TV, says bowl a fourth to fifth stump line and remain patient. Easier said than done of course. Abhijato Sensarma has emailed in to ask if I would pick Bancroft for the next Test. Short answer: yes. If the Australian brains trust think he\u2019s the right man for the opening Test then it would be harsh to hook him after just two knocks. Clearly he can\u2019t continue to score poorly but the solidity of his place also depends on the form of Marcus Harris, the only other opener among the tour party. Morning Stuie. Hard not to think Smith is key to all of this. If he fails to last an hour you can see England racing away with things. If he\u2019s entrenched after lunch the balance of power swings. Should Australia set a chase of 200 I\u2019d put them favourites. Anything under 150 it\u2019s England\u2019s to lose. Small margins. Leg-side long-hops. Simples... Leanne Indaimo wins the prize for the first email of the day. \u201cI noted with interest that yesterday one of the bloggers commented that he liked to think if he grew up in a non cricketing country that he would be a cricket fan,\u201d she emails. \u201cI am writing to say that this is possible. My son was born in England and since he was five grew up in Italy, a cricket desert. I can say that thanks to the brainwashing of his Aussie parents he is a huge fan of the game. Obsessive even. Despite his English birthplace he is of course a dinky die true blue Aussie supporter. He is now living back in England about to experience his first Ashes series on enemy soil. He has no idea what he is in for!!\u201d. Lovely stuff. Perhaps your son could now throw his allegiance behind Janjua Cricket Club Brescia in the new European Cricket League? The Australian spin on things is provided by Geoff Lemon and yesterday he was as interested in the behaviour of Steve Smith in the field as he was at the crease. The interesting thing about this is that Smith has not finished his punishment. His year-long ban from playing has ended, but not the second year\u2019s ban from holding leadership positions in any Australia team. So it was equally interesting to see him in the slip cordon as Australia tried to take the last few English first-innings wickets, directing traffic in the field as smoothly as he ever did while captain. Today\u2019s global TMS link. For overseas listeners only. If you\u2019re in the UK, grab their coverage in the usual BBC places. Here it is, with thanks to Peter Haining for sending it through. In Anderson\u2019s absence Stuart Broad has led the attack manfully. Barney Ronay has reminds us how the often maligned paceman raises his game to match the stakes. Broad has loved these contests. Unlike Anderson, whose numbers take a dive against the Aussies, Broad\u2019s game rises to meet England\u2019s most consistently cussed opponents, particularly in the English summer. Jimmy Anderson update: The sight of a limping Anderson hobbling the winning run late on Monday evening would be something to behold. Mo, Mo, Mooooo, how d\u2019you like it? How d\u2019you like it? Nobody seems to have any idea how to dislodge the most fidgety and idiosyncratic of batsmen but Chris Woakes is a man with a plan, possibly, as Ali Martin reports. Much has been made of the hostility from English crowds towards Australia\u2019s players in this series but Tim Adams has sketched a much more promising scene from the Edgbaston outer where pantomime villain Smith is winning over the home support. The stages of Smith\u2019s 144 runs were like a fast-forward primer in theories of the tribal language of crowds. Smith\u2019s first 50 runs were greeted with solid animosity from the home crowd; his vivid century was first booed and then almost immediately applauded, often by the same people. Detractors had wavered and then become converts. By the time the Australian\u2019s innings closed, as the evening sun was on the ground, most of the English crowd were quite happy to give him the rich ovation his brilliance and fortitude deserved. If you want to remind yourself of the state of play then tuck into Vic Marks\u2019 report from stumps on day three. Yet again Steve Smith is the obstacle driving the English to distraction. While he is still at the crease nothing can be guaranteed. In front of another packed house here England made some solid progress: a first-innings lead of 90 and three early scalps when Australia batted again. But Smith, who reminded us on the first day how he can transform an innings, remained. Weather: There\u2019s already more than enough tension in this contest but if you wanted some more, how about the prospect of some inclement weather this afternoon? It\u2019s currently fine and cool in the West Midlands but there is the strong risk of a rain-related interruption or two after lunch. In case you hadn\u2019t realised already, I should point out I am not Geoff Lemon. He will be with you before play begins but for the time being please forward any email correspondence to jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com or tweets to @JPHowcroft. Good morning everybody and welcome to day four of the first Ashes Test from Edgbaston. This contest is beautifully poised with Australia resuming their second innings leading by 34 runs with seven wickets in hand. WinViz suggests England have a 67% chance of victory, Australia just 23%, but I wonder if that takes into account the necessary Steve Smith loading. The Australian superstar will once again be at the crease when play resumes and England\u2019s bowlers seem bereft of ideas for how to prevent him remaining there indefinitely. With the pitch offering diminishing returns for the seamers and the Dukes ball failing to swing there will be enormous pressure on the shoulders of Moeen Ali to spin England to the brink of victory this morning. Should Australia bat on much beyond lunch the nerves around Edgbaston will be jangling loudly. A target in excess of 150 will be tricky to chase against an Australian attack containing Nathan Lyon on a surface offering plenty to the off-spinner. The opening couple of hours today look set to shape the remainder of the series. It\u2019s going to be gripping.",

A thorn in Liverpool\u2019s side throughout but fluffed a one on one. 7 Leroy San\u00e9 Bright start but went off after 10 minutes with ankle injury following a clash with Alexander-Arnold. 6 Subs Jesus for San\u00e9 10 \u2013 Brazilian\u2019s pace caused trouble for Liverpool\u2019s defenders when he came on. 7; G\u00fcndogan for D Silva, 60; Foden for De Bruyne 89",

      "body": "<p>Two menaces have stalked America throughout its history. One is gun violence. The other is white supremacy. In El Paso, Texas, on Saturday they collided.</p> \n<p>A 21-year-old gunman with a hatred of Hispanic immigrants killed 20<em><strong> </strong></em>people in a shopping mall in the eighth deadliest mass shooting in American history. The suspect is believed to have posted online an anti-immigrant screed that praised the killing of 51 people in Christchurch mosques in New Zealand in March.</p> \n<p>Less than 13 hours later, nine people were killed in Dayton, Ohio, in a second mass shooting.</p> \n<p>The chilling reality of domestic terrorism \u2013 which now results in far more deaths than foreign terrorism \u2013 was acknowledged by political analysts, Democratic candidates for president and George P Bush, nephew of former president George W Bush.</p> \n<p>But there was no televised appearance from President Donald Trump, who attempted to wash his hands of the hate crime in a few tweets. His acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, toured TV studios on Sunday expressing righteous indignation. \u201cI blame the people who pull the trigger,\u201d Mulvaney told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. \u201cGoodness gracious, is someone really blaming the president? People are sick, until we address why people think this way.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is a need for caution when drawing a direct line between politicians and heinous acts: the Columbine high school massacre happened under President Bill Clinton, the Orlando nightclub shooting under Barack Obama. But the lone gunman theory is often a way of refusing to grapple with underlying motives. For those who live with violence and its consequences in their communities every day, context matters.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/03/el-paso-shooting-21-year-old-suspect-in-custody-as-officials-investigate-possible-hate\">El Paso shooting: 21-year-old suspect 'posted anti-immigrant manifesto'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Trump has spent the past month stoking racial resentments, tweeting that four US congresswomen of colour should \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries, holding a rally where the crowd chanted \u201csend her back!\u201d and deriding the majority African American district that contains part of Baltimore as \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"651e9ce3-2129-4ca5-a84f-43560c5a8573\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BEwXCLzqEWw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Inflammatory words matter in a country that has more guns than people. Tragically, shootings have become as American as apple pie. Dayton was the 22nd mass killing in America this year, according to an AP/USA Today/Northeastern University mass murder database, which tracks all attacks involving four or more people killed. America has by far the highest gun ownership rate in the world.</p> \n<p>Time and again Congress refuses to act. Not even the shooting that killed 20 students and six teachers at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 led to meaningful reforms, even though a sympathetic president, Barack Obama, was in the White House.</p> \n<p>Then came Trump. The National Rifle Association (NRA) was a key part of his coalition, spending $30m to help him beat Hillary Clinton. He has resisted basic measures such as signing background checks for gun sales into law. A promise to defend the second amendment, the right to bear arms, always rouses one of the biggest cheers at his campaign ralles. Trump wildly exaggerates Democrats\u2019 plans for gun control.</p> \n<p>In addition, Trump has fomented a toxic discourse around immigration and race. He questioned Obama\u2019s birthplace, launched his election campaign with talk of Mexican \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d and drew moral equivalence between white supremacists and anti-fascist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.

      "bodyText": "Two menaces have stalked America throughout its history. One is gun violence. The other is white supremacy. In El Paso, Texas, on Saturday they collided. A 21-year-old gunman with a hatred of Hispanic immigrants killed 20 people in a shopping mall in the eighth deadliest mass shooting in American history. The suspect is believed to have posted online an anti-immigrant screed that praised the killing of 51 people in Christchurch mosques in New Zealand in March. Less than 13 hours later, nine people were killed in Dayton, Ohio, in a second mass shooting. The chilling reality of domestic terrorism \u2013 which now results in far more deaths than foreign terrorism \u2013 was acknowledged by political analysts, Democratic candidates for president and George P Bush, nephew of former president George W Bush. But there was no televised appearance from President Donald Trump, who attempted to wash his hands of the hate crime in a few tweets. His acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, toured TV studios on Sunday expressing righteous indignation. \u201cI blame the people who pull the trigger,\u201d Mulvaney told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. \u201cGoodness gracious, is someone really blaming the president? People are sick, until we address why people think this way.\u201d There is a need for caution when drawing a direct line between politicians and heinous acts: the Columbine high school massacre happened under President Bill Clinton, the Orlando nightclub shooting under Barack Obama. But the lone gunman theory is often a way of refusing to grapple with underlying motives. For those who live with violence and its consequences in their communities every day, context matters. Trump has spent the past month stoking racial resentments, tweeting that four US congresswomen of colour should \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries, holding a rally where the crowd chanted \u201csend her back!\u201d and deriding the majority African American district that contains part of Baltimore as \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d. Inflammatory words matter in a country that has more guns than people. Tragically, shootings have become as American as apple pie. Dayton was the 22nd mass killing in America this year, according to an AP/USA Today/Northeastern University mass murder database, which tracks all attacks involving four or more people killed. America has by far the highest gun ownership rate in the world. Time and again Congress refuses to act. Not even the shooting that killed 20 students and six teachers at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 led to meaningful reforms, even though a sympathetic president, Barack Obama, was in the White House. Then came Trump. The National Rifle Association (NRA) was a key part of his coalition, spending $30m to help him beat Hillary Clinton. He has resisted basic measures such as signing background checks for gun sales into law. A promise to defend the second amendment, the right to bear arms, always rouses one of the biggest cheers at his campaign ralles. Trump wildly exaggerates Democrats\u2019 plans for gun control. In addition, Trump has fomented a toxic discourse around immigration and race. He questioned Obama\u2019s birthplace, launched his election campaign with talk of Mexican \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d and drew moral equivalence between white supremacists and anti-fascist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. He has used the word \u201cinvasion\u201d numerous times when tweeting about the US-Mexico border; the gunman in El Paso, in a \u201cmanifesto\u201d being linked to him, complained of a \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas\u201d. White nationalist terrorism is now a real danger, yet it receives a fraction of the attention of Islamist extremism. The FBI director, Christopher Wray, testified last month that the bureau has recorded about 100 arrests of domestic terrorism suspects in the past nine months; many were linked to white supremacist violence. Trump\u2019s critics say he is fanning the flames of bigotry. Presidential candidate Cory Booker told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cI want to say with more moral clarity that Donald Trump is responsible for this. He is responsible because he is stoking fears and hatred and bigotry. He is responsible because he is failing to condemn white supremacy, and seeing it as it is. Trump believes the rhetoric worked for him in 2016, not with a majority of Americans (he lost the popular vote), but with the white-majority states that were crucial to his victory in the electoral college. The past month \u2013 where has doubled down on race baiting and launched unprecedented racist attacks on Democrat politicians of color \u2013 strongly implies he will try the same approach in 2020 but perhaps go even further.

Therefore, is this a season to fear for Leeds fans? Was last season a one-shot deal denied by the arch-enemy in Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County? Leeds were a delight for much of last season, not only in terms of the football they played, but also in their sheer unpredictability, oscillating between lengthy runs of victories and then runs of losses. In truth, and despite the many advocates he has in football\u2019s literati, it was never quite the same once Christmas came and the tiredness began to settle in, as is likely to happen for any group of players put through multiple training sessions while their contemporaries get to rest up in their cinema rooms at home. <br><br>There is a school of thought that Bielsa is someone whose ideas are best carried out by others - Guardiola and Pochettino come readily to mind - in the fashion of the Byrds and Jimi Hendrix covering Bob Dylan songs and making them palatable, hit records. Thing is that Dylan wasn\u2019t too bad on his own, either, and neither is Bielsa a bad manager. But, like his Bobness these days, you never quite know what you are going to get other than something enigmatic, sometimes difficult and only sometimes rewarding. <br><br>(Apologies to Bristol City, a good team who went close themselves last season and can do so again, but that has been the Bielsa effect on the Championship; he has to be talked about. And it probably won\u2019t last much longer so let\u2019s talk about him while we can.)<br><br>The kick-off is at 4.30pm UK time, which clashes, somewhat oddly, with the second half of the Charidee Shield. Who comes up with these schedules? </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-04T14:31:54.265Z\">at 3.31pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the report from Ben Fisher. Classic of the genre from the City social media team. Patrick Bamford speaks. It\u2019s nice when you are a striker to start with a goal. In terms of pressure it\u2019s on he team as a goal. We have to come back stronger and show what what we can do. Pablo Hernandez speaks: We knew we had a hard start today, we were very good in possession. We lost the chance to go to the Premier League. Today we showed we can do the same work and we deserved to win. We knew it was a difficult game. We scored in the first half and this gave us confidence. We scored three goals and it\u2019s important to get all three goals. That\u2019s it. Leeds, as they did last season, have started like a train. Can they go one better than last season? Their inventiveness and energy meant they swarmed all over City, and the skill of Hernandez meant that was converted into three points. City looked what they are, a team that has lost a couple of their better players in the summer. 90+4 min: This one is done, but still City push on. The season is too young for there to be conservation of effort. 90+3 min: City push on, the cause not yet abandoned but time is ticking on. Bielsa is off his bucket and issuing a withering rebuke to Leif Davis for some infringement of the code or other. Casilla, again, comes for a ball he might not have done. He just about gets there, and takes out teammate Liam Cooper in the process. 90+1 min: Helder Costa gets his first chance to run at the City defence but the ball gets stuck under his feet. 90 min: Five minutes added on. 89 min: Bamford, chasing down a fine pass from Phillips, wins a corner and respite for Leeds. That is easily cleared by Hunt, and then City can launch an attack. Two goals in whatever is left looks beyond them. 88 min: Up comes Casilla to claim a corner, and he does well to catch it. Matty Taylor is booked for clattering him. The Spaniard will happily take his time in recovering from that. 86 min: Final Leeds sub: Leif Davis comes on for Jack Harrison. 85 min: A member of the Leeds bench has been shown a yellow card. Seems something was said that did not meet the referee\u2019s approval. 84 min: Leeds clear hurriedly as Patterson tries to find space to shoot. Lee Johnson\u2019s team have shown what might have been possible during this flurry. A pity about the previous 75 minutes. 83 min: Yet another chance for City: Weimann loops a header over. Casilla was in no man\u2019s land and will have been happy to see that fly over. 81 min: And City win a free-kick in a highly dangerous position. Patterson hammers his attempt wide of the goal. That was a waste but the momentum is with the team losing 3-1. 80 min: And a final City change: On comes Matty Taylor for a tired Diedhiou. This may yet be an uncomfortable last ten minutes. City are having a go here, too late. It has been a chastening afternoon but here\u2019s Weimann, cutting in from the right, past a half-hearted Hernandez tackle, and then he beats Casilla at the near post. Game on? 77 min: Bristol City have their first effort for a while as Diedhiou tries to bundle the ball home. He is stopped in his tracks. Been a thankless afternoon for the striker. 75 min: Here comes Helder Costa, the loan signing from Wolves, who was a rather surprising departure from Molineux. He comes on for Klich. Hernandez moves infield. 73 min: \u201cWe\u2019re top of the league,\u201d sing the Leeds fans. And they are right. Dallas charges on down the right, his shot is deflected into the path of Harrison, coming from the opposite flank, who has time and space to pass the ball into the net. 69 min: Bristol City free-kick. The new wall rules lead to some chaotic scenes as two walls form. Brownhill takes and hits the side-netting, while Casilla crashed into the post. These rules: New rules designed to stop interference with defensive . The new rules, which came into effect on 1 June, state that players from the attacking team are no longer allowed to stand within one metre of the defensive wall. 68 min: Looks like City\u2019s changes have effected a change from Bielsa. Of course they have. Is he playing that 3-3-1-3 yet? 66 min: Bielsa sits meditatively on his bucket. This is going well for him. But probably not well enough for him. 64 min: Double City change: O\u2019Dowda and Palmer are off and Eliasson and Paterson are on. 63 min: Leeds go close to a third. Harrison burns down the left, sets up Klich, whose shot comes to Hernandez. A toiling City defence gets the ball away. 61 min: Casilla comes forward to play the ball out, as his manager likes, but his touch is hardly that of an Ederson and is launched somewhere into the Bristol skyline. 60 min: O\u2019Dowda, who was culpable in the second goal when being beaten by Hernandez, tries to get City back into the game but Leeds break again, and Forshaw fires in a shot on goal that goes wide. 58 min: That would appear to be that. Leeds have been so dangerous when Hernandez gets on the ball. Bamford, on whom there is a great burden, with Roofe heading to Anderlecht, has got his goal. Here come Leeds again through Jack Harrison. Phillips plays it out to Hernandez, and the magician digs out a cross from the byline. Bamford charges on to it to score with a bullet header. 54 min: Kalas, back in the action, clears the danger when Harrison launches the ball out to the left. Ah, a third booking, and a delayed one. Hernandez is booked for trying to pull back Kasey Palmer in that move that White put an end to. And...a fourth, when Palmer leaves his mark with a tackle and is carded. 52 min: Hernandez on the wing, then Dallas try to force the issue. But Pack steps out to clear the danger. Then Palmer sends the ball to Weimann, whose cross to Diedhiou was dangerous but Ben White, the debutant, cleared the danger. He\u2019s had an impressive game so far. 50 min: Up go Bamford and Kalas for the ball, and the recent signing from Chelsea - Kalas, that is - goes down with what looks like a head injury. Kalas leaves the field looking dazed but not too dazed to continue. 49 min: Second booking of the game. Adam Forshaw has made one foul too many and totting up means he gets a yellow. 47 min: First booking of the game, and it\u2019s City\u2019s Pack for pulling Klich back. Klich might have got more as he lashed out with a boot after the foul. 46 min: Right, we are back. It looks as if that fracas at half-time has calmed down, as Bielsa and Lee Johnson smile and shake hands. There was another game on today, and here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report. It ends with a Bielsa flashpoint as he starts rollicking Kasey Palmer for lashing the ball at Stuart Dallas when the whistle blows. All par for the course, and Bielsa ought to be happy with that half. His has been the better team, and Hernandez has been by far the best player. What a goal that was. 45+2 min: Two minutes have been added on. Bamford wins a free-kick as a pack of defenders hack at him. That gets the Leeds fans singing for him, so well done to him. They could have been singing even louder as Hernandez fashions another chance for Forshaw, but Bristol City get it clear. 45 min: Klich goes down under a heavy tackle from Pack. It was a fair tackle, though, even if Bielsa is again up on his feet to complain. 43 min: Groans from the home fans when Leeds are able to release the pressure after a Pack error and almost score. Hernandez plays in Forshaw, whose shot, whipped with his right foot, goes wide. It gets Bielsa off his bucket. 41 min: Leeds play the ball with calm, perhaps trying to take the sting out of this game until half-time. But then O\u2019Dowda gets to the sideline, and his cross is missed by Casilla, and then Brownhill gets a shot in which Casilla does well to save. He redeemed himself with that. 38 min: Bristol City go in chase of that equaliser, and they are stepping up their efforts. Weimann has a shot blocked as Lee Johnson calls for more from the sideline. 36 min: Hernandez almost escapes again as Dasilva lets him go clear. Leeds\u2019 magician runs out of space, though. For a team who have set up defensively, City do have a habit of sitting off their opponents. 35 min: O\u2019Dowda makes a skidding run, head down, on the left flank, leaving Dallas for dead but his cross is not wonderful. Then, Kalas storms forward and he finds himself at the byline. Casilla cuts off the ball\u2019s angle. Better from City. 33 min: Leeds continue to push on, with first Harrison and then Klich stopped by last-gasp tackles. The torpor of the early moments is gone. 31 min: That tactic of whacking it up long almost worked. Weimann\u2019s cross just evades the striker. A reminder that Leeds are fallible at the back. 29 min: Leeds are pushing on for a second already and City must ride out this storm. They are paying for a gameplan which seems to centre around hitting it long to Diedhiou and hoping something comes of it. \u201cMarching On Together,\u201d sing the Yorkshire contingent. 28 min: Had it been coming? Leeds had been the better team, but without looking like creating a true chance. But as soon as Hernandez got time on the ball, with Kalas guilty of allowing him such space, a goal became a fait accompli. Hernandez is given room to turn and spin, and shoot into the top left-hand corner. City stepped off him and paid the pice. 24 min: Leeds with a striker would be dangerous, with respect to Patrick Bamford, the divine bouffant. If their season is to go awry, a lack of goals and teeth up front is what will cost them. 23 min: Forshaw gets a snap shot in, and Taylor Moore gets in the way. Leeds knocking on the door with far more vigour than their opponent at the moment. 21 min: The Leeds and Bristol City fans are engaging in banter, on a subject not to be discussed freely in these pages. When Stuart Dallas blams a ball way out of play when attempting a \u2018diag\u2019, Bielsa\u2019s disgust is barely hidden. 19 min: Casilla goes on safari after a Dasilva ball is aimed at a speeding Weimann. It turns out to be the correct decision and Leeds eventually clear their lines. Weimann again gets caught out at the other end and is lucky that Barry Douglas could land nothing more than a corner, which is badly overhit by Phillips. 17 min: Leeds getting some joy down the right-hand side of the City defence. There seems to be a miscommunication between Hunt and Weimann. 15 min: The ball was chipped through by Jay Dasilva, but there were no takers. Neither side have created a chance as yet....but here\u2019s a half-chance for Bamford. Douglas gives a napping Weimann the slip but the ball doesn\u2019t make it to Bamford. Then, comes a real chance. A City mix-up presents Bamford with a sighter on goal. Bamford flashes his shot wide. 13 min: Diedhiou is the target for a lofted ball, and he is muscled out of it. Not an easy afternoon as a lone frontman for him. 11 min: Ironic cheers as a free-kick goes Leeds\u2019 way after a foul on Bamford. Why? Don\u2019t ask me. 10 min: Bielsa in consultation with one of his assistants, who may actually be the translator from before. Leeds have gone flat already. Tired after pre-season? 8 min: City stepping this up a bit, after that circumspect start. Bielsa is sat on his bucket, and chunnering away to himself. 6 min: Josh Brownhill and Kasey Palmer force a free-kick from a retreating Leeds defence. Who will take? Palmer takes the call, and hits it straight at Casilla. 5 min: Only one debutant for Leeds in Ben White at the back, filling the not inconsiderable shoes of Pontus Jansson. Leeds are doing most of the passing, with City happy to sit back. 3 min: The Leeds fans are in full voice. Their squad may be thin, and getting thinner, but at this time of the season hope springs if not eternally, then initially...Patrick Bamford chases the ball down and Bristol keeper Bentley has to hack away. 1 min: Early attack from Leeds but it comes to naught. Kasey Palmer steps out to clear the danger. And away we go....with Leeds taking the kick-off... Ok, here come the teams and here comes the season for Bristol City and Leeds United. This, by the way is Leeds\u2019 centenary season. Look up the story of Leeds City to find out why the club was not formed until 1919. Marcelo Bielsa speaks, via a translator. [On why he stayed]The proposal of the club, the quality of what we can do. The first thing is to try again and get the things we deserve. And at the same time I believe in the goal of this club: to get a promotion [On losing players]These are four players we have to lose get the financial fair play, we decided to have a squad with 18 payers. We have difficulties because Kemar Roofe, who we wanted to be part of the 18, will probably leave. Here\u2019s a reminder of yesterday\u2019s action from the EFL. It didn\u2019t disappoint. The Bristol City manager, Lee Johnson, speaks. It\u2019s a good test for both sides; Leeds are a fantastic side and a big club. [On players leaving] Unless you are a top-six club you are at the mercy of that. It is fantastic that players are getting the opportunity to go from Bristol City to the Premier League. We are in a good position, we have a good owner. We get to use the money. I look forward to bringing in some other payers soon. Talking of Ben, here\u2019s his Championship preview and what he had to say about today\u2019s teams. Several clubs will fancy their chances of breaking into the top six but Bristol City are among the best equipped. They have made several eye-catching additions, with Jay Dasilva and Tomas Kalas arriving permanently from Chelsea, joining a vibrant team determined to improve after knocking on the door last season. Leeds United, too, possess ample bite, despite Marcelo Bielsa sanctioning the departure of Pontus Jansson. As Leeds flailed in April, the Argentinian stated his squad would struggle to reproduce the performances that propelled them from 13th to third but Bielsa was doing himself a disservice. Bielsa has tickled a small squad \u2013 Helder Costa, Jack Harrison and Ben White have arrived on loan \u2013 but after a brutal pre-season, including a trip to Sydney, triple and even quadruple sessions, they are down to bare bones after injuries to Luke Ayling and Kemar Roofe and will start with one fit senior striker, Patrick Bamford. If Bielsa were not in situ, Leeds\u2019s hand would be considerably weaker. Bit of Bristol City news from our Ben Fisher. Those teams in analogue fashion: Bristol City: Bentley, Hunt, Kalas, Moore, Dasilva, Pack, Brownhill, O\u2019Dowda, Weimann, Palmer, Diedhiou Subs: Wollacott, Baker, Taylor, Szomidcs, Eliasson, Paterson, Rowe Leeds: Casilla, Dallas, Cooper, White, Douglas, Phillips, Klich, Forshaw, Hernandez, Harrison, Bamford Subs: Miazek, Davis, Alioski, Gotts, Bogusz, Clarke, Costa Is there a manager more prone to secondseasonitis than Marcelo Bielsa? He hasn\u2019t actually stayed with any club for more than two years, though he had far lengthier spells with the Chilean and Argentinian national teams. Therefore, is this a season to fear for Leeds fans? Was last season a one-shot deal denied by the arch-enemy in Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County?

And it probably won\u2019t last much longer so let\u2019s talk about him while we can.) The kick-off is at 4.30pm UK time, which clashes, somewhat oddly, with the second half of the Charidee Shield.

Last Friday, the kingdom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/saudi-women-can-now-travel-without-a-male-guardian-reports-say\" title=\"\">announced</a> that it is allowing women to apply for passports, to travel without permission and to have more control over family matters \u2013 registering a marriage, divorce or child\u2019s birth, and being issued official family documents. These changes to the guardianship system should be genuinely transformative. But celebration can only be partial when women\u2019s rights remain so tightly constricted and the activists who have fought hard for such changes are paying so high a price.</p> <p>Women will still need permission from a male relative to marry or divorce, or to leave prison or domestic violence refuges. The system needs not reform but <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/endmaleguardianship\" title=\"\">abolition</a>. Other laws still hold women back.

      "bodyText": "The jubilation of women in Saudi Arabia was real \u2013 and understandable. Last Friday, the kingdom announced that it is allowing women to apply for passports, to travel without permission and to have more control over family matters \u2013 registering a marriage, divorce or child\u2019s birth, and being issued official family documents. These changes to the guardianship system should be genuinely transformative. But celebration can only be partial when women\u2019s rights remain so tightly constricted and the activists who have fought hard for such changes are paying so high a price. Women will still need permission from a male relative to marry or divorce, or to leave prison or domestic violence refuges. The system needs not reform but abolition. Other laws still hold women back. And as Ms Saffaa, an Australia-based Saudi artist and activist, warned: \u201cWhen women become equal to men, Saudi Arabia is still going to remain an authoritarian dictatorship that violates countless human rights.\u201d These guardianship changes, like the lifting of the ban on women\u2019s driving last year, form part of the crown prince\u2019s promise to modernise the kingdom. Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan calls for a rise in women\u2019s participation in the workplace, from 22% to 30%; the new laws also bar discrimination in the workplace. But more pertinent is surely that Riyadh wants to change the conversation and persuade the rest of the world (and especially potential investors) to see dynamic, progressive leadership \u2013 rather than the autocratic regime that led the charge into the pointless and terrible war in Yemen, is responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and is still holding around a dozen courageous female campaigners, including Lujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sadah. Other activists have been banned from travel, or are now in exile. It was no doubt keen too to end the embarrassment of Saudi women pleading for asylum after fleeing abroad, saying they had no other way to escape abuse. It is not a coincidence that the female activists were detained shortly before the driving ban was lifted. Their seizure \u2013 and the torture some are believed to have experienced in custody \u2013 sent a clear message to Saudi women and men too: liberties are not to be demanded as a right, but are to be received gratefully when those in charge decide to hand them out. Canada, one of the few countries to press for the women\u2019s release, got little backing when the kingdom lashed out in retaliation. The silence is shaming, as is the complicity of the UK and others in other regards: a UN special rapporteur recently called for a moratorium on the sale of surveillance tools used to target dissidents and activists. The crown prince deserves no gratitude for these changes. The credit goes to the Saudi women who are still suffering for their battle. Everything possible should be done to free them.",

Nevertheless, the anger being expressed suggests that the bargain president Vladimir Putin allowed Sobyanin to make with Russia\u2019s capital is beginning to disintegrate, just as Putin\u2019s popularity across Russia is sliding. The aggressive line the authorities have taken could be counterproductive, but concessions may start a spiral effect that will chip away at the Kremlin\u2019s grip on power.</p> <p>Leading the protests are associates of campaigner Alexei Navalny, whose team of investigators shine a light on rampant corruption among Russia\u2019s elite. Their well-documented and slickly produced videos contain allegations that are hard for the Kremlin to brush off. Punishments for Navalny\u2019s activities in recent years have included a ban on appearing on state television, repeated court cases, the jailing of his brother for several years, an attack with green paint that almost made him blind in one eye, and a refusal to allow him on to the ballot paper for the 2018 presidential election. He was jailed for 30 days last month to keep him away from this round of protests, and last week suffered what his lawyers claim could have been a poisoning attempt in jail.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Many of those protesting are young people who are doing reasonably well financially, but want  Russia to become a different kind of country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A group of Navanly\u2019s associates are emerging from his shadow and proving equally problematic. Lyubov Sobol, a 31-year-old lawyer who has worked with Navalny since 2011, planned to stand as an independent in the Moscow elections and collected the thousands of voter signatures required, only to be told, like others, that an \u201cexpert committee\u201d had found many of the signatures to be fake, and her candidacy invalid.

Videos of her berating electoral officials about their corruption have gone viral.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, they understand that if they let even one independent into the Moscow city parliament, it will become a completely different place,\u201d she told the<em> Observer </em>last week. \u201cThere is no discussion about any important issues there at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Sobol is three weeks into a hunger strike over not being allowed to stand, and was speaking from a camp bed at the independent candidates\u2019 campaign headquarters. Her voice still had its steely resolve, but she spoke at a fraction of her usual volume, and complained of a spinning head and kidney pain. She is determined to continue her protest, however.</p> <p>When she began her hunger strike, even many of her supporters thought it was a strange battle to pick, but the protest is now about more than a mere local parliament vote, and Sobol has become one of its key figures. On Saturday, she gathered her strength to set out for the protest, but was detained before it even started. \u201cWho are you scared of? Are you scared of your own citizens, of a woman on her 20th day of hunger strike?\u201d she shouted as riot police bundled her into a waiting van.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d1f2775454b27d44067a0116f0e68cf2a1a4c8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d1f2775454b27d44067a0116f0e68cf2a1a4c8a/0_155_4621_2774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Putin in 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Five years ago, Putin boosted his approval ratings with the annexation of Crimea. There is no such option today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikhail Metzel/Tass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The political mood now is reminiscent of the last major protest season to hit the country, in late 2011 and 2012, when the illusion that Russia could be heading for liberalisation under Dmitry Medvedev was dispelled by Putin\u2019s announcing his return to the Kremlin. Then, Putin\u2019s sliding ratings were boosted by a new conservative ideology, and later by the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Demonstrators were painted as an anti-patriotic \u201cfifth column\u201d opposing the pro-Putin, patriotic majority.</p> <p>Alongside the stick came the carrot of a new Moscow: landscaped parks, pedestrianised streets and a food and drink scene that wowed football fans who came for the World Cup last year. For many in the capital, everyday life really did become more pleasant. But if 2018 was the summer of football-themed street parties, international fraternity and pride in the new Moscow, 2019 is shaping up to be the summer of police crackdowns.</p> <p>\u201cThe period of Crimea euphoria is over; the five years when the population was mobilised have come to an end,\u201d said Lev Gudkov, director of Levada-Center, Russia\u2019s only independent polling agency. The majority of Russians still see the west as an enemy, he said, but far fewer are willing to make personal sacrifices for the sake of the confrontation.</p> <p>Real incomes across Russia have dropped by more than 10% over the past five years, and an unpopular pension reform last year led to a 20% drop in Putin\u2019s approval rating. Many of the 64% who still support the president do so for lack of viable alternatives, and it is hard to imagine a \u201csecond Crimea\u201d that could provide Putin with a new boost. In the provinces, discontent is fuelled by economic hardship and a lack of prospects, but in the absence of an organised opposition network, protests that do erupt are usually over local issues such as waste disposal or city planning, rather than linked to concrete political demands.</p> <p>The Moscow phenomenon is different. Demonstrations this summer have been noticeably more youth-led than those in 2012. Many of those protesting are young people who are doing reasonably well financially, but want a different kind of country.</p> <p>\u201cI have been to a lot of protests and this time I really noticed the generation factor,\u201d said Yevgenia Albats, a veteran journalist who edits <em>New Times</em> magazine. \u201cThere were few people there my age; they were all young, and they\u2019re not scared.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-03T15:55:57/embed.html\" data-alt=\"russia graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-03T15:55:57/embed.html\">russia graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Young people in Putin\u2019s Russia have it better, relative to their elders, than their peers in western Europe, Gudkov said. While the richest segment of most western societies is the pre-pension age group, in Russia, 35-year-olds have the most cash. They have been better able to take advantage of opportunities for career growth and financial enrichment than their Soviet-schooled parents. For many years, a sense of pride in a resurgent Russia, steady economic growth and improvements in everyday life kept this young urban people satisfied.</p> <p>Now, many are tired of the anti-western rhetoric and keen for change. They are also wary of the arbitrary rules of Russian life \u2013 the way the tentacles of the state can appear amid the new Moscow of bike lanes and artisan eateries and seize victims without warning.</p> <p>The sizable protests earlier this year over the detention of journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/11/russian-officials-ivan-golunov-investigative-journalist\" title=\"\">Ivan Golunov</a> on obviously fabricated drugs charges were a sign of broader irritation at what might once have been a niche issue troubling only rights activists and fellow journalists. In that case, the authorities stepped back and freed Golunov, and they have also made concessions in a number of other recent cases of single-issue protests. This is harder to do in the case of the Moscow elections, however, as it would be seen as a sign of weakness and could threaten the Kremlin\u2019s monopoly on political life. On the other hand, cracking down hard could prove counterproductive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd7c087ce530825c214b73eda0f638fe4f9d3684\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd7c087ce530825c214b73eda0f638fe4f9d3684/0_1_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opposition politician Lyubov Sobol with helpers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opposition politician Lyubov Sobol is on a hunger strike to protest over her exclusion from the elections.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatyana Makeyeva/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of panic and they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Sobol. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a good solution.\u201d</p> <p>The protesters, on the whole, have remained peaceful. The most violent act of last week\u2019s protest came when a man threw a bin in the vague direction of riot police. The authorities, on the other hand, have gone in hard. People were dragged kicking and screaming into police vans; some were hit with batons, and one man suffered a fractured leg. He said he\u2019d been out jogging and had not even been involved in the protest when police pushed him to the ground.</p> <p>That was only a taste of what might come if things get more tense, or if the protesters themselves start to get violent: there were no water cannon, rubber bullets or even tear gas. Still, authorities have warned Muscovites that peaceful protest could have serious, long-term consequences.</p> <p>Sobyanin, in an interview with the television channel owned by his Moscow administration last week, thanked police for carrying out their \u201cduty\u201d and accused the protesters of engaging in \u201cpre-planned and well-prepared mass unrest\u201d. The opposition leaders had, he claimed falsely, called on protesters to storm the mayoralty, and it was only the fine work of the police that had stopped such an eventuality from occurring. This suggested that the authorities could be preparing for a real crackdown.</p> <p>Every day last week, in a sign that authorities are desperate to squeeze the oxygen out of the protests and warn people that taking part carries a real danger of jail, there was a new move against various pillars of the opposition. On Thursday, independent television station TV Rain, which has been live-streaming the protests, said it had received notice of a sudden tax inspection. The following day, there were reports that Navalny\u2019s anti-corruption foundation could be investigated for money-laundering.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Now that Putin has cleared the field of any real opposition, his mantra that a change in government will lead to chaos and unrest is probably a self-fulfilling prophecy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nine people were arrested for \u201cmass unrest\u201d, which can carry 15-year jail terms. It has been hinted that police will round up draft-dodgers among men arrested at the protests. With full control of the levers of state, Putin can create an upside-down world where anti-corruption investigators are investigated for corruption and those beaten up by police are accused of provoking violence.</p> <p>Already, the protests may have put an end to the widespread idea that Sobyanin wanted to present himself as a potential national political figure and possibly even a compromise solution to the fraught dilemma of who will take over from Putin when his latest presidential term runs out in 2024. By giving into the demands of protesters, Sobyanin would lose ground to people around Putin with security services backgrounds who favour a crackdown.</p> <p>\u201cThey are afraid to be considered traitors, because every offer to compromise with protesters is seen as potential capitulation,\u201d said political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. \u201cTheir importance was that they kept the people politically loyal, or at least passive, by creating a glittering new Moscow. If they are not succeeding in this, what is the need for them?\u201d</p> <p>The debate about what comes next is vexing not just for the authorities, but also for the protest leaders. It is now clear that the official response is likely to be repression and potentially lengthy jail sentences, even for peaceful protesters. In calling people to attend \u201cunsanctioned\u201d protests, are organisers pursuing the only means of effecting real change, or irresponsibly raising the stakes?</p> <p>Nobody is in any doubt that a real uprising along the lines of Ukraine\u2019s 2014 Maidan revolution would be aggressively put down. Now that Putin has cleared the field of any real opposition, his mantra that a change in government will lead to chaos and unrest is probably a self-fulfilling prophecy. And while Navalny is a charismatic politician with broad potential appeal, he has low approval nationally. Many of those at the Moscow protests don\u2019t support him, but are merely irritated by the cynicism of Putin\u2019s Kremlin.</p> <p>If, in the medium term, Putin does lose his grip on power, the threat is more likely to come from inside the Kremlin than from the streets. Sobol spoke of \u201ca wonderful Russia of the future\u201d \u2013 where courts and press are free and corruption is minimised \u2013 but it is hard to imagine this coming about without serious violence and state collapse. \u201cI have no illusions, but anything can happen,\u201d said Sobol, her voice weak but determined. \u201cThings will change sooner or later. We\u2019re doing everything to make sure it happens soon. If we\u2019re not going to leave and we\u2019re going to live here, we have to fight for our rights.\u201d</p>",

The political mood now is reminiscent of the last major protest season to hit the country, in late 2011 and 2012, when the illusion that Russia could be heading for liberalisation under Dmitry Medvedev was dispelled by Putin\u2019s announcing his return to the Kremlin. Then, Putin\u2019s sliding ratings were boosted by a new conservative ideology, and later by the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Demonstrators were painted as an anti-patriotic \u201cfifth column\u201d opposing the pro-Putin, patriotic majority. Alongside the stick came the carrot of a new Moscow: landscaped parks, pedestrianised streets and a food and drink scene that wowed football fans who came for the World Cup last year. For many in the capital, everyday life really did become more pleasant. But if 2018 was the summer of football-themed street parties, international fraternity and pride in the new Moscow, 2019 is shaping up to be the summer of police crackdowns. \u201cThe period of Crimea euphoria is over; the five years when the population was mobilised have come to an end,\u201d said Lev Gudkov, director of Levada-Center, Russia\u2019s only independent polling agency. The majority of Russians still see the west as an enemy, he said, but far fewer are willing to make personal sacrifices for the sake of the confrontation. Real incomes across Russia have dropped by more than 10% over the past five years, and an unpopular pension reform last year led to a 20% drop in Putin\u2019s approval rating. Many of the 64% who still support the president do so for lack of viable alternatives, and it is hard to imagine a \u201csecond Crimea\u201d that could provide Putin with a new boost. In the provinces, discontent is fuelled by economic hardship and a lack of prospects, but in the absence of an organised opposition network, protests that do erupt are usually over local issues such as waste disposal or city planning, rather than linked to concrete political demands. The Moscow phenomenon is different. Demonstrations this summer have been noticeably more youth-led than those in 2012. Many of those protesting are young people who are doing reasonably well financially, but want a different kind of country. \u201cI have been to a lot of protests and this time I really noticed the generation factor,\u201d said Yevgenia Albats, a veteran journalist who edits New Times magazine. \u201cThere were few people there my age; they were all young, and they\u2019re not scared.\u201d Young people in Putin\u2019s Russia have it better, relative to their elders, than their peers in western Europe, Gudkov said. While the richest segment of most western societies is the pre-pension age group, in Russia, 35-year-olds have the most cash. They have been better able to take advantage of opportunities for career growth and financial enrichment than their Soviet-schooled parents. For many years, a sense of pride in a resurgent Russia, steady economic growth and improvements in everyday life kept this young urban people satisfied. Now, many are tired of the anti-western rhetoric and keen for change. They are also wary of the arbitrary rules of Russian life \u2013 the way the tentacles of the state can appear amid the new Moscow of bike lanes and artisan eateries and seize victims without warning. The sizable protests earlier this year over the detention of journalist Ivan Golunov on obviously fabricated drugs charges were a sign of broader irritation at what might once have been a niche issue troubling only rights activists and fellow journalists. In that case, the authorities stepped back and freed Golunov, and they have also made concessions in a number of other recent cases of single-issue protests. This is harder to do in the case of the Moscow elections, however, as it would be seen as a sign of weakness and could threaten the Kremlin\u2019s monopoly on political life. On the other hand, cracking down hard could prove counterproductive. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of panic and they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Sobol. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a good solution.\u201d The protesters, on the whole, have remained peaceful. The most violent act of last week\u2019s protest came when a man threw a bin in the vague direction of riot police. The authorities, on the other hand, have gone in hard. People were dragged kicking and screaming into police vans; some were hit with batons, and one man suffered a fractured leg. He said he\u2019d been out jogging and had not even been involved in the protest when police pushed him to the ground. That was only a taste of what might come if things get more tense, or if the protesters themselves start to get violent: there were no water cannon, rubber bullets or even tear gas. Still, authorities have warned Muscovites that peaceful protest could have serious, long-term consequences. Sobyanin, in an interview with the television channel owned by his Moscow administration last week, thanked police for carrying out their \u201cduty\u201d and accused the protesters of engaging in \u201cpre-planned and well-prepared mass unrest\u201d. The opposition leaders had, he claimed falsely, called on protesters to storm the mayoralty, and it was only the fine work of the police that had stopped such an eventuality from occurring. This suggested that the authorities could be preparing for a real crackdown. Every day last week, in a sign that authorities are desperate to squeeze the oxygen out of the protests and warn people that taking part carries a real danger of jail, there was a new move against various pillars of the opposition. On Thursday, independent television station TV Rain, which has been live-streaming the protests, said it had received notice of a sudden tax inspection. The following day, there were reports that Navalny\u2019s anti-corruption foundation could be investigated for money-laundering. Nine people were arrested for \u201cmass unrest\u201d, which can carry 15-year jail terms. It has been hinted that police will round up draft-dodgers among men arrested at the protests. With full control of the levers of state, Putin can create an upside-down world where anti-corruption investigators are investigated for corruption and those beaten up by police are accused of provoking violence. Already, the protests may have put an end to the widespread idea that Sobyanin wanted to present himself as a potential national political figure and possibly even a compromise solution to the fraught dilemma of who will take over from Putin when his latest presidential term runs out in 2024. By giving into the demands of protesters, Sobyanin would lose ground to people around Putin with security services backgrounds who favour a crackdown. \u201cThey are afraid to be considered traitors, because every offer to compromise with protesters is seen as potential capitulation,\u201d said political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. \u201cTheir importance was that they kept the people politically loyal, or at least passive, by creating a glittering new Moscow. If they are not succeeding in this, what is the need for them?\u201d The debate about what comes next is vexing not just for the authorities, but also for the protest leaders. It is now clear that the official response is likely to be repression and potentially lengthy jail sentences, even for peaceful protesters. In calling people to attend \u201cunsanctioned\u201d protests, are organisers pursuing the only means of effecting real change, or irresponsibly raising the stakes? Nobody is in any doubt that a real uprising along the lines of Ukraine\u2019s 2014 Maidan revolution would be aggressively put down. Now that Putin has cleared the field of any real opposition, his mantra that a change in government will lead to chaos and unrest is probably a self-fulfilling prophecy. And while Navalny is a charismatic politician with broad potential appeal, he has low approval nationally. Many of those at the Moscow protests don\u2019t support him, but are merely irritated by the cynicism of Putin\u2019s Kremlin. If, in the medium term, Putin does lose his grip on power, the threat is more likely to come from inside the Kremlin than from the streets. Sobol spoke of \u201ca wonderful Russia of the future\u201d \u2013 where courts and press are free and corruption is minimised \u2013 but it is hard to imagine this coming about without serious violence and state collapse. \u201cI have no illusions, but anything can happen,\u201d said Sobol, her voice weak but determined. \u201cThings will change sooner or later. We\u2019re doing everything to make sure it happens soon. If we\u2019re not going to leave and we\u2019re going to live here, we have to fight for our rights.\u201d",

At the end of July the Spanish comedian known as El Monaguillo (the altar boy; real name Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez Mel\u00e9ndez) conducted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elmonaguillo/status/1154385657499987968\" title=\"\">his own poll</a>. \u201cReally important survey,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGazpacho with cucumber or without cucumber?\u201d</p> <p>Of the 3,809 people who replied, 63% were in favour of adding cucumber to the cold Andaluc\u00edan soup. Others felt differently \u2013 some vehemently so.</p> <p>\u201cCucumber in gazpacho is gastronomic terrorism!\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.grupodanigarcia.com/en/group-and-chef/\" title=\"\">Dani Garc\u00eda</a>, a chef who runs a three-Michelin-star restaurant and who, like his friend El Monaguillo, is from Andaluc\u00eda.</p> <p>When another Twitter user had the temerity to remind Garc\u00eda that he was famous for his recipe for cherry gazpacho, the chef replied: \u201cAre you really comparing the elegance of a cherry to the aggressiveness of a cucumber?\u201d</p> <p>The issue has prompted long and thoughtful pieces in the Spanish press, and churned up another familiar culinary controversy.</p> <p>Charo Barrios, president of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Just-For-Fun/Academia-del-Gazpacho-Andaluz-472019799805378/\" title=\"\">Academy of Andaluc\u00edan Gazpacho</a>, insists people can put whatever vegetables they like into the soup, and says cucumber is not the only disputed ingredient. \u201cCucumber\u2019s definitely an option, but there are other debates as well, like whether you add bread,\u201d she says. \u201cBread gives the soup a different texture and means you\u2019re adding carbohydrates. And then there\u2019s the debate over adding water. It depends on the quality of the tomatoes, but if they\u2019re not great, it could end up too watery. I think it\u2019s more about bread than cucumber, but we think you can add whatever you want, from other vegetables to fruit.\u201d</p> <p>Barrios keeps thing simple and proudly Andaluc\u00edan. \u201cI make it with a tiny bit of garlic, onion, half a cucumber, one or two green peppers, tomatoes, good salt, sherry vinegar and good extra virgin olive oil.\u201d</p> <p>Garc\u00eda told the <em>Observer</em> that while his tweets were tongue in cheek, he could not abide the disruptive feistiness of cucumber in gazpacho. His epiphany came in the late 1990s, when he elevated the humble soup into a dish for the high-end restaurant where he was working.</p> <p>\u201cThe first one I made that was a little out of the ordinary was a cherry gazpacho \u2013 even though it was based on a traditional recipe, for raspberry gazpacho,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I made it, I couldn\u2019t find a way to balance the cucumber because it\u2019s one of those ingredients that I call invasive. No matter how much you try to balance it out, it\u2019s a taste that just keeps on punching through. I wanted it to be tomato and cherry on people\u2019s palates, not cucumber. So in 1998, I just went, \u2018That\u2019s it \u2013 bye bye cucumber!\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>When most people thought of gazpacho, he added, they thought of a simple tomato soup with cucumber, peppers, garlic, olive oil, vinegar and bread. \u201cBut, historically, a gazpacho can be many things: a white gazpacho [with garlic and almonds] is <em>ajo blanco</em>, a green one is made with green tomatoes and an orange one is made with bitter oranges. There are as many gazpacho recipes as there are people: it\u2019s all about how you make it at home.\u201d</p> <p>Fernando Huidobro, president of the <a href=\"https://academiaandaluzadegastronomia.com/\" title=\"\">Andaluc\u00edan Academy of Gastronomy and Tourism</a>, laughed off the idea of people getting hung up on a single ingredient. \u201cThe oldest, most original recipes for gazpacho are fairly anarchic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a way for country people to feed themselves: \u2018What can I eat easily to get me through my work? I\u2019ve got water, I\u2019ve got oil, I\u2019ve got garlic and I\u2019ve got vinegar.

      "bodyText": "Wounds Jamie Oliver inflicted three years ago when he added chorizo to rice and called it paella remain raw, while hopes of an end to the war over whether onions belong in a tortilla de patatas seem as forlorn as ever. But as Spain endures a particularly sweltering summer, the debate has turned to the country\u2019s best-known antidote to the heat and, specifically, the question of whether cucumber has any place in a deliciously cooling bowl of gazpacho. The row began, not unpredictably, on Twitter. At the end of July the Spanish comedian known as El Monaguillo (the altar boy; real name Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez Mel\u00e9ndez) conducted his own poll. \u201cReally important survey,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGazpacho with cucumber or without cucumber?\u201d Of the 3,809 people who replied, 63% were in favour of adding cucumber to the cold Andaluc\u00edan soup. Others felt differently \u2013 some vehemently so. \u201cCucumber in gazpacho is gastronomic terrorism!\u201d said Dani Garc\u00eda, a chef who runs a three-Michelin-star restaurant and who, like his friend El Monaguillo, is from Andaluc\u00eda. When another Twitter user had the temerity to remind Garc\u00eda that he was famous for his recipe for cherry gazpacho, the chef replied: \u201cAre you really comparing the elegance of a cherry to the aggressiveness of a cucumber?\u201d The issue has prompted long and thoughtful pieces in the Spanish press, and churned up another familiar culinary controversy. Charo Barrios, president of the Academy of Andaluc\u00edan Gazpacho, insists people can put whatever vegetables they like into the soup, and says cucumber is not the only disputed ingredient. \u201cCucumber\u2019s definitely an option, but there are other debates as well, like whether you add bread,\u201d she says. \u201cBread gives the soup a different texture and means you\u2019re adding carbohydrates. And then there\u2019s the debate over adding water. It depends on the quality of the tomatoes, but if they\u2019re not great, it could end up too watery. I think it\u2019s more about bread than cucumber, but we think you can add whatever you want, from other vegetables to fruit.\u201d Barrios keeps thing simple and proudly Andaluc\u00edan. \u201cI make it with a tiny bit of garlic, onion, half a cucumber, one or two green peppers, tomatoes, good salt, sherry vinegar and good extra virgin olive oil.\u201d Garc\u00eda told the Observer that while his tweets were tongue in cheek, he could not abide the disruptive feistiness of cucumber in gazpacho. His epiphany came in the late 1990s, when he elevated the humble soup into a dish for the high-end restaurant where he was working. \u201cThe first one I made that was a little out of the ordinary was a cherry gazpacho \u2013 even though it was based on a traditional recipe, for raspberry gazpacho,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I made it, I couldn\u2019t find a way to balance the cucumber because it\u2019s one of those ingredients that I call invasive. No matter how much you try to balance it out, it\u2019s a taste that just keeps on punching through. I wanted it to be tomato and cherry on people\u2019s palates, not cucumber. So in 1998, I just went, \u2018That\u2019s it \u2013 bye bye cucumber!\u2019.\u201d When most people thought of gazpacho, he added, they thought of a simple tomato soup with cucumber, peppers, garlic, olive oil, vinegar and bread. \u201cBut, historically, a gazpacho can be many things: a white gazpacho [with garlic and almonds] is ajo blanco, a green one is made with green tomatoes and an orange one is made with bitter oranges. There are as many gazpacho recipes as there are people: it\u2019s all about how you make it at home.\u201d Fernando Huidobro, president of the Andaluc\u00edan Academy of Gastronomy and Tourism, laughed off the idea of people getting hung up on a single ingredient. \u201cThe oldest, most original recipes for gazpacho are fairly anarchic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a way for country people to feed themselves: \u2018What can I eat easily to get me through my work? I\u2019ve got water, I\u2019ve got oil, I\u2019ve got garlic and I\u2019ve got vinegar. If I\u2019ve got bread, I\u2019ll put bread in\u2019.\u201d It was only later, when people started adding tomato, that the more \u201cofficial\u201d recipe was born, said Huidobro, adding that the soup had traditionally been made cold, with oranges in the absence of tomatoes, or hot if people were lucky enough to have some partridge. \u201cEach family can add cucumber if they want, just like you can put in onion \u2013 which is an atrocity as far as the purists are concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think Dani\u2019s right: cucumber is invasive and tends to take over. It\u2019s a family matter at the end of the day. It\u2019s a basic thing that was originally made with whatever you had to hand \u2013 that\u2019s what made it unique.

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism.

      "bodyText": "People across the Indian-administered side of Kashmir queued for hours outside petrol stations and cash machines on Sunday following a heightening of security measures that has prompted fears of unrest. Thousands of tourists and Hindu pilgrims have been evacuated since Friday, after the Indian government cancelled the annual Amarnath Yatra, a 45-day pilgrimage to a Himalayan cave shrine. Officials said they had received intelligence suggesting an attack on pilgrimage routes, which 300,000 people have set out on since July. Kashmir residents were told not to panic, though curfews and evacuations continued to be imposed on hospitals and educational institutions over the weekend. On Sunday evening mobile internet was cut across Kashmir valley. Kashmir is claimed by India and Pakistan in full and ruled in part by both. An insurgency on the Indian-administered side has been ongoing for three decades, and tens of thousands of people have been killed. The deployment of 10,000 extra troops last week prompted speculation that Delhi is preparing to remove Kashmir\u2019s special status, which prevents people from outside of the state from buying land in the Muslim-majority territory. The ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has repeatedly pledged to scrap such rules, but doing so would almost certainly trigger unrest and escalate tensions with Pakistan.

No way of knowing if this is true but if it is then I\u2019ll see all of you on the other side of whatever is in store. Allah save us,\u201d he said on Twitter. It was unclear why Abdullah and others would be targetted by Indian authorities for detention. In Srinagar, the largest city in Indian-administered Kashmir, preparations for Eid, which is one week away, have been abandoned by many. \u201cThey want us to die of this anxiety,\u201d said one man waiting at a petrol station on Saturday night.

      "body": "<p>Do you remember when the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was supposedly so remote that it was scarcely worth discussing in advance of the referendum? \u201cThe day after we vote to leave,\u201d Michael Gove said in April 2016, \u201cwe hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want.\u201d</p> <p>As Theresa May began her negotiations with the European Union, no deal next became a theoretical possibility that had to be \u201ckept on the table\u201d as part of the poker game. As Boris Johnson told the Commons in July 2017: \u201cThere is no plan for no deal, because we\u2019re going to get a great deal.\u201d</p> <p>Then, during the Conservative leadership contest, Johnson declared that the chances of leaving the EU without an agreement were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-chances-of-no-deal-brexit-are-a-million-to-one-against\" title=\"\">a million to one against</a>\u201d \u2013 Bullingdonese for \u201cquite likely, I suppose, but I do wish you\u2019d stop asking\u201d.</p> <p>Now, at last, we have entered a quite different strategic and doctrinal zone, in which no deal is presented not only as an outcome that is endurable, but \u2013 for many Brexiteers \u2013 positively desirable. They contemplate the prospect of a \u201cclean\u201d exit not with a sense of impending collective failure, but the millenarian zeal of a religious cult on the verge, at last, of reaching the hill upon which they will build a new Jerusalem (while feasting on chlorinated chicken sandwiches).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To squeeze in an election before Brexit day would require a vote of no confidence as soon as the Commons returned</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Johnson\u2019s pledge that the UK will leave on 31 October, \u201cno ifs or buts\u201d, there is at least a bracing clarity. We know, finally, what we are dealing with: a prime minister, aided by the reassembled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/what-vote-leave-leaders-really-said-about-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">Vote Leave campaign</a> masquerading as a government, who will do absolutely anything to achieve this primary and defining objective.</p> <p>What might his methods include? I do not believe that the prime minister and his team are as enthusiastic as some suggest about an early autumn election. That said, Johnson is throwing cash about like a politician preparing for electoral battle \u2013 witness the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-drops-2bn-nhs-cash-bomb-to-woo-women-voters-s58jv9z6x\" title=\"\">\u00a32bn boost</a> for the NHS he announced in the Sunday Times. And the Friday meetings in Downing Street chaired by his de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, clearly have a focus and ferocity consistent with preparations to go to the country.</p> <p>He is reportedly confident that he can neutralise Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, and it is certainly true that the need for a separate provisional wing of the pro-leave movement is now much less obvious than it was under May. </p> <p>But Johnson and his team also know that Labour, frozen in aspic under Jeremy Corbyn, may now have reached its moment of maximum vulnerability. Cummings is said to believe that the Liberal Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/brecon-radnorshire-byelection-lib-dems-jane-dodds-win-cuts-johnson-commons-majority-to-one\" title=\"\">resurgent</a> and unambiguously pro-remain, will eat disproportionately into Labour\u2019s vote, to the net benefit of the Tories. On Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, James Cleverly, the Tory chairman, conspicuously declined to rule out a general election.</p> <p>Let us say, in any case, that the choice is not in No 10\u2019s hands. When parliament returns on 3 September, the government will certainly face a vote of no confidence if it is still on course for a no-deal Brexit. After last week\u2019s byelection in Brecon and Radnorshire, Johnson\u2019s majority \u2013 which, never forget, depends upon the tetchy support of the Democratic Unionists \u2013 has been sliced to one.</p> <p>Bear with me on the technicalities: under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a vote of no confidence in the government would trigger a two-week scramble to form a new administration. If that quest failed \u2013 as it would \u2013 an election would be triggered. The Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 requires 25 working days between the dissolution of parliament and polling day. To squeeze in an election before Brexit day would require a vote of no confidence as soon as the Commons returned; the pre-emptive cancellation of the party conferences; a fortnight of pointless attempts to form an alternative government ending on, say, 17 September; and a snap election held after the minimum five-week campaign on Thursday, 24 October.

      "bodyText": "Do you remember when the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was supposedly so remote that it was scarcely worth discussing in advance of the referendum? \u201cThe day after we vote to leave,\u201d Michael Gove said in April 2016, \u201cwe hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want.\u201d As Theresa May began her negotiations with the European Union, no deal next became a theoretical possibility that had to be \u201ckept on the table\u201d as part of the poker game. As Boris Johnson told the Commons in July 2017: \u201cThere is no plan for no deal, because we\u2019re going to get a great deal.\u201d Then, during the Conservative leadership contest, Johnson declared that the chances of leaving the EU without an agreement were \u201ca million to one against\u201d \u2013 Bullingdonese for \u201cquite likely, I suppose, but I do wish you\u2019d stop asking\u201d. Now, at last, we have entered a quite different strategic and doctrinal zone, in which no deal is presented not only as an outcome that is endurable, but \u2013 for many Brexiteers \u2013 positively desirable. They contemplate the prospect of a \u201cclean\u201d exit not with a sense of impending collective failure, but the millenarian zeal of a religious cult on the verge, at last, of reaching the hill upon which they will build a new Jerusalem (while feasting on chlorinated chicken sandwiches). In Johnson\u2019s pledge that the UK will leave on 31 October, \u201cno ifs or buts\u201d, there is at least a bracing clarity. We know, finally, what we are dealing with: a prime minister, aided by the reassembled Vote Leave campaign masquerading as a government, who will do absolutely anything to achieve this primary and defining objective. What might his methods include? I do not believe that the prime minister and his team are as enthusiastic as some suggest about an early autumn election. That said, Johnson is throwing cash about like a politician preparing for electoral battle \u2013 witness the \u00a32bn boost for the NHS he announced in the Sunday Times. And the Friday meetings in Downing Street chaired by his de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, clearly have a focus and ferocity consistent with preparations to go to the country. He is reportedly confident that he can neutralise Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, and it is certainly true that the need for a separate provisional wing of the pro-leave movement is now much less obvious than it was under May. But Johnson and his team also know that Labour, frozen in aspic under Jeremy Corbyn, may now have reached its moment of maximum vulnerability. Cummings is said to believe that the Liberal Democrats, resurgent and unambiguously pro-remain, will eat disproportionately into Labour\u2019s vote, to the net benefit of the Tories. On Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, James Cleverly, the Tory chairman, conspicuously declined to rule out a general election. Let us say, in any case, that the choice is not in No 10\u2019s hands. When parliament returns on 3 September, the government will certainly face a vote of no confidence if it is still on course for a no-deal Brexit. After last week\u2019s byelection in Brecon and Radnorshire, Johnson\u2019s majority \u2013 which, never forget, depends upon the tetchy support of the Democratic Unionists \u2013 has been sliced to one. Bear with me on the technicalities: under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a vote of no confidence in the government would trigger a two-week scramble to form a new administration. If that quest failed \u2013 as it would \u2013 an election would be triggered. The Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 requires 25 working days between the dissolution of parliament and polling day. To squeeze in an election before Brexit day would require a vote of no confidence as soon as the Commons returned; the pre-emptive cancellation of the party conferences; a fortnight of pointless attempts to form an alternative government ending on, say, 17 September; and a snap election held after the minimum five-week campaign on Thursday, 24 October. Johnson wins, and Britain leaves a week later. How likely is it that this precise sequence will fall into place? How often does politics observe such neat patterns? It is more likely, indeed, that 31 October could fall in the middle of an election campaign \u2013 or even (since it is a Thursday) on polling day itself. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, believes there is no legal impediment to the UK leaving Europe even as rosette-bearing politicians crisscross the nation in battle buses. Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, reportedly dissents from this opinion, on the grounds that convention precludes ministers from taking any \u201cmajor policy decisions\u201d in the prelude to an election.

In this role, he presided over extensive purges of suspected enemies within and outside the ruling party, resulting in the execution of more than 300,000 Cambodians between 1975 and 1979, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/khmer-rouge\" title=\"\">Khmer Rouge</a> regime of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/pol-pot\" title=\"\">Pol Pot</a> controlled what was then known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cambodia\" title=\"\">Democratic Kampuchea</a>.</p> <p>During his years in power, Chea earned a reputation for dogmatism and ruthlessness. He put into practice the reckless, utopian policies of the party, which included emptying the cities, closing schools and monasteries, abolishing private property and empowering the poorest of the poor. These policies, set in motion at breakneck speed, were enormously costly in human terms: in addition to those executed by the state, almost one and a half million Cambodians are estimated to have died during those years, of starvation, overwork and misdiagnosed diseases.</p> <p>Nuon Chea was a pseudonym for Lau Kim Korn, also known as Longreth Raodi, who was born to a prosperous Sino-Khmer family in Battambang, Cambodia. In 1941, after Thailand annexed the province, Chea moved to Bangkok, where he completed his schooling, spent some time as a Buddhist monk and enrolled briefly at Thammasat University.</p> <p>When Battambang returned to French colonial control in 1946, Chea remained in Bangkok, working as a clerk in a government department. He moved in radical circles and joined the Thai Communist party before leaving Thailand in 1950 when an anti-communist regime came to power there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6be8c1b349a0d2774944e6ed8b5fe6b30185a4c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6be8c1b349a0d2774944e6ed8b5fe6b30185a4c1/159_286_1853_1112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Pol Pot, Noun Chea, Ieng Sary and Son Sen in Phnom Penh, 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and Son Sen in Phnom Penh, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heng Sinith/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Battambang, Chea joined his cousin Sieu Heng in the Indochina Communist party.

From 1 October, our disciplinary code will make specific provision for sexual misconduct and the standard of proof in all cases, including those involving sexual misconduct, will be changed from \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d to the \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d. It does not follow, of course, that all complaints will necessarily lead to disciplinary proceedings being instigated, since this depends on sufficient evidence of sexual misconduct in any given case.</p> <p>Complaints of sexual misconduct arising before 1 October will continue to be dealt with under the existing rules, and all complaints of sexual misconduct will continue to be investigated for evidence of harassment. In practice, a substantial proportion of cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct will fall within the definition of harassment.

      "bodyText": "Contrary to the impression given by your coverage of the interpretation of the definition of harassment in disciplinary cases (Cambridge sexual misconduct rule change branded \u2018unlawful\u2019, theguardian.com, 31 July), the University of Cambridge will continue to investigate complaints of sexual misconduct for evidence of harassment. From 1 October, our disciplinary code will make specific provision for sexual misconduct and the standard of proof in all cases, including those involving sexual misconduct, will be changed from \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d to the \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d. It does not follow, of course, that all complaints will necessarily lead to disciplinary proceedings being instigated, since this depends on sufficient evidence of sexual misconduct in any given case. Complaints of sexual misconduct arising before 1 October will continue to be dealt with under the existing rules, and all complaints of sexual misconduct will continue to be investigated for evidence of harassment. In practice, a substantial proportion of cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct will fall within the definition of harassment. If a finding of harassment is made the disciplinary committee has the full range of sanctions available to it. The university has been at the forefront of efforts within higher education to ensure that students feel protected and supported against all forms of harassment. We believe it is essential that students continue to come forward to report to us what has happened to them so they can get specialist support and advice on their options, whether that is an internal or external investigation.

Although I don\u2019t expect that to happen this year, they won\u2019t want to fall too far behind City, who will probably win at least eight of their first 10 games.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-04T15:15:22.921Z\">at 4.15pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d46f5588f084f687f35075e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-04T15:10:33.552Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>48 min </strong>Sterling hits the post, although the flag had gone up anyway. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2180382106955c606e1da55db35e303e40da1eb7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2180382106955c606e1da55db35e303e40da1eb7/0_0_3500_2300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sterling shoots and hits the post.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sterling shoots and hits the post.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-04T15:19:46.407Z\">at 4.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d46f5038f084f687f35075c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-04T15:09:48.704Z\">4.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>48 min </strong>\u201cAs a person who has directly witnessed the hatred which comprises an intense sporting rivalry (i.e. India v Pakistan in cricket) like you demand English football needs more of, let me tell you that while it makes for riveting encounters and atmospheres, the vile comments, physical fights and detestable actions from both sides behind the scenes is never worth it just for spectacle,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma.</p> \n  <p>I wouldn\u2019t disagree with that at all \u2013 I was talking solely about the on-field scenes, not what happens behind them.

The Premier League is the richest and most popular league in the world. But there\u2019s one thing money can\u2019t buy: hate. English football has not had a classic rivalry since Arsenal and Manchester United\u2019s mutual enmity fizzled out in 2005. And although we\u2019re unlikely to see a decade-long feud like that again, there is a real chance that, for the next few years, Liverpool and Manchester City could provide the kind of rivalry that elevates sport to the highest possible level.</p> \n  <p>The signs are good. They are the champions of Europe and England respectively, and arguably the two best teams in the world. They have already taken part in an extraordinary title race, not to mention an immense, intense Champions League quarter-final, and are likely to form their own mini-league again this season. Today they meet in the Community Shield, the match all journalists are contractually obliged to describe as the curtain-raiser for a new season. And although the game means nothing, it might tell us something about the relationship between the sides.</p> \n  <p>When their rivalry was at its peak, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq9wBI77O04#t=4m46s\">Arsenal and United usually turned this match into a pre-season unfriendly</a>. Football has changed since Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira compared testosterone levels, and the burgeoning rivalry between City and Liverpool has been defined as much as anything by mutual respect. But things might be about to get a little saltier. </p> \n  <p>There was some needle in City\u2019s vital league win at the Etihad in January, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-spending-jurgen-klopp\">there have been a few words in the build-up to this game</a>. Anfield will not want for atmosphere when City visit in November. And if it all kicks off today, we\u2019ll know something special is brewing.</p> \n  <p><strong>Kick off </strong>is at 3pm. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-04T12:43:45.963Z\">at 1.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola bigs up Manchester United ... Jonathan Wilson\u2019s match analysis: Here\u2019s Ed Aarons\u2019 player ratings: So there we are: the annual curtain has been traditionally raised, and Liverpool and Man City are still pretty good. I\u2019ve not a clue how we\u2019ve got here but we\u2019re here, so join us next weekend when the fun and frolics begin in earnest. Ta-ra. Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report... Aguero joins him, and the tickertape descends, somewhat apologetically. The players bounce about a bit and do all the usual. Claudio Bravo looks happy after proving the old truism that dodgy keepers save penalties. Leroy Sane is there too, while David Silva prepares to lift the trophy. Here come City to collect the famous old frisbee. Ilkay Gundogan leads them up, and Kyle Walker is in absolute floods of tears. Steve McManaman wonders why Liverpool haven\u2019t strengthened their attack, because their front three have played long seasons and can\u2019t be expected to stay fit. Up go Liverpool to get their losers\u2019 medals, in front of roughly 28 people. Robin van Persie is impressed with how Liverpool fought back following City\u2019s strong first half. Rio Ferdinand is concerned about how Liverpool\u2019s back four, one of the fastest in the league, played offside with such a high line. He reckons they should be chasing back. He\u2019s not sure that it\u2019ll be a two-horse race for the league, though, because there are other good teams about. \u201cFor me growing up the Community Shield was a big one,\u201d says Kyle Walker. He really does; you and David Moyes baith, old mate. Kevin de Bruyne, who has the bumfluffiest beard ever, says it was a really tough game and the openness tells you that the teams aren\u2019t ready to go yet. Liverpool will be pretty happy with that. You\u2019d have expected City to be a little ahead of them given the respective pre-seasons, but both look ready to go. Jesus scores! Liverpool 4-5 Manchester City Jesus places the ball to his left, and though Alisson went the right way he couldn\u2019t get there. Salah scores! Liverpool 4-4 Manchester City Salah scores, curling it high to his left. But City are at match point, and Gabriel Jesus is walking forward. Zinchenko scores! Liverpool 3-4 Manchester City Alisson got hands on it, diving to his left, but it went through him and into the net. Oxlade-Chamberlain scores! Liverpool 3-3 Manchester City Excellent stuff, hammered high to his left. Bravo went the wrong way. Foden scores! Liverpool 2-3 Manchester City A confident penalty, whipped to his right as Alisson dives the wrong way. Lallana scores! Liverpool 2-2 Manchester City A good penalty, dragged carefully towards the bottom-left corner. Bernardo Silva scores! Liverpool 1-2 Manchester City Another good penalty, hammered into the bottom-right corner. Bravo saves from Wijnaldum! Liverpool 1-1 Manchester City A poor penalty, too close to Bravo, who dived to his right and punched it away. Gundogan scores! Liverpool 1-1 Manchester City He\u2019s scored a penalty on this ground in a Champions League final, so the pressure of the Community Shield was never likely to get to him. Shaqiri scores! Liverpool 1-0 Manchester City Good penalty, whacked to his right. Liverpool will take the first penalty, Xherdan Shaqiri to be precise. That was a cracking game, far more competitive than most Community Shields. City were the better team in the first half, but Liverpool ran them ragged in the second half and fully deserved Joel Matip\u2019s equaliser. Penalties it is. 90+4 min Bravo makes another good save, this time at his near post from Shaqiri. Liverpool have battered City in the second half. 90+3 min: Walker clears off the line from Salah! That was a brilliant, acrobatic piece of defending, a scissor-kick to clear off his own line after Salah headed the ball gently towards goal. His first shot was blocked by Stones, slidingin front of Bravo. The ball came back to Salah, who headed past Bravo towards the empty net. But Walker put on the afterburners to get back and clear spectacularly. 90+2 min Sterling makes a good run round the outside of the Liverpool defence, but his deflected cross is cleared by Gomez in the six-yard box. 90 min There will be four minutes of added time. 88 min Phil Foden comes on for City to replace Kevin De Bruyne. 87 min: Bravo makes a fine save from Salah! Rodri was robbed 20 yards from his own goal by a combination of Lallana and Oxlade-Chamberlain. The ball ran through to Salah, whose first-time shot on the turn was superbly blocked at close range by the outrushing Bravo. 87 min Salah shoots straight at Bravo from 20 yards. He should have played Keita in that time. There\u2019s an argument that Salah, for richer and poorer, is the most selfish player in world football at the moment. 85 min Salah cuts infield and has a pop from 20 yards. It hits Zinchenko and loops onto the roof of the net. Liverpool have been so good int he second half, because they were a mess in the first. This team, like all Jurgen Klopp\u2019s I suppose, are a great advert for the human spirit. 83 min Bravo makes an important save from Keita. Lallana picked him out nicely on the edge of the box, and Keita sidefooted a first-time shot that was palmed away by Bravo as he dived to his left. Keita might have done better, on reflection. 80 min If this match ends in a draw it will go straight to penalties. 79 min A triple change for Liverpool: Shaqiri, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lallana replace Firmino, Henderson and Origi. A deserved equaliser for Liverpool! Henderson\u2019s free-kick from a narrow position on the right skimmed off the head of somebody in the middle and came to Van Dijk beyond the far post. He lobbed it calmly back into the six-yard box, where Matip beat Bravo with a precise downward header. 75 min This is much more like the 2018-19 Liverpool. In fact I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw Manchester City have so little of the ball in a 20- or 30-minute period. 73 min De Bruyne screws a low shot from the left of the box that is comfortbaly held by the diving Alisson. 71 min The last man Otamendi makes a vital, lunging tackle on Salah, who tried to nutmeg him on the edge of the box. Salah has looked so sharp, even if his decision-making hasn\u2019t always been the best. 70 min \u201cYour Manchester City bias is embarrassing,\u201d says Carl Colley. \u201cFrom your profile picture you\u2019re clearly too fat and old to be on work experience... are you related to the editor? I\u2019m sure Mummy &amp; Daddy can get you another job when this one goes tits up.\u201d They\u2019re dead, but I appreciate the career encouragement. 69 min \u201cMaybe the Guardian liveblogs need some real, bubbling, needly hate, too,\u201d says Matt Dony, \u201cin order to bring the best out of all of us. You absolute third-rate hack.\u201d 67 min A double bowling change for Liverpool: Joel Matip and Naby Keita replace Trent Alexander-Arnold and Fabinho. 65 min Liverpool have pegged City back in the last 10 minutes. The game feels like it\u2019s about to boil over, with lots of niggly tackles and shoves off the ball. It\u2019s not exactly Chelsea v Leeds in the 1970 FA Cup final, but by the standards of modern football it\u2019s quite lively. 61 min Sterling misses a great chance to make it 2-0. He was put through on goal by Walker, with all the time in the world to decide what to do. Too much time. He couldn\u2019t decide whether to shoot or give the goal to Walker; in the end he did neither and ran the ball straight into the loving arms of Alisson. 61 min Ilkay Gundogan replaces David Silva. There was a VAR check a moment ago after a clash between Alexander-Arnold and Bernardo Silva, but there was nothing much in it and Martin Atkinson was not encouraged to take another look. 60 min \u201cSo Peter Oh thought City were OK when we were rubbish,\u201d says Paul Ruffley. \u201cBless.\u201d 58 min: Salah hits the post! That was a fine effort. He wriggled away from a couple of City players on the edge of the area and drove a low, left-footed shot through the legs of David Silva. Bravo was slightly unsighted and the ball rebounded off the outside of the post. 57 min: Van Dijk hits the underside of the bar! Alexander-Arnold\u2019s scruffy corner from the left bounced past everyone at the near post and was hooked towards goal by Van Dijk. It beat Bravo, rebounded off the underside of the bar and bounced down onto the line. Van Dijk thought it was in; goal-line technology confirmed it was not. 51 min Liverpool look really rusty. That doesn\u2019t matter one iota today, but it will if they get off to a slow start in the Premier League. One thing Liverpool have never done since 1990 is have back-to-back title challenges. In fact, the last two times they almost won the league, they started the next season so poorly that they were out of the title race by October. Although I don\u2019t expect that to happen this year, they won\u2019t want to fall too far behind City, who will probably win at least eight of their first 10 games. 48 min Sterling hits the post, although the flag had gone up anyway. 48 min \u201cAs a person who has directly witnessed the hatred which comprises an intense sporting rivalry (i.e. India v Pakistan in cricket) like you demand English football needs more of, let me tell you that while it makes for riveting encounters and atmospheres, the vile comments, physical fights and detestable actions from both sides behind the scenes is never worth it just for spectacle,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. I wouldn\u2019t disagree with that at all \u2013 I was talking solely about the on-field scenes, not what happens behind them. Rivalries, often fuelled by hate (not just my word but the one used by those involved), have produced some of the most compelling sport we\u2019ve ever seen. That\u2019s an immutable truth of competitive sport. 47 min Good play from City. The superb Sterling robs Alexander-Arnold and zips down the left before crossing into the area. Jesus touches/miscontrolls it into the path of David Silva, who thrashes a half-volley over the bar from 15 yards. 46 min Peep peep! \u201cRe: City\u2019s oh-so-stylish, sponsorless kit,\u201d begins Peter Oh. \u201cIf you ask me, the last time City were a palatable club was when their shirt featured the name of a fraternally named office supply manufacturer. I once owned one of their typewriters.\u201d Oh, Brother. Or perhaps I should say: Brother, Oh? Peep peep! City lead through Raheem Sterling\u2019s early goal, which was both well-worked and scruffy. They have been much the better team in general play - but Liverpool have created three good chances of their own, all falling to Mo Salah. Pep Guardiola walks off with the air of a man who\u2019s just put the winning lottery ticket on a spin cycle. Not sure what\u2019s up with him but he looks pretty despondent. See you in 10 minutes for the second half! 45 min \u201cYou state in the preamble that English football needs hate,\u201d says Stevie Robertson. \u201cReally? I get you want rivalry but \u2018hate\u2019? You\u2019re better than that.\u201d I\u2019m really not. I know what you mean - but, put simply, the best football I\u2019ve seen was the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United from 1996-2005, and that was overflowing with hatred. And as well as giving the games a competitive edge that made them unmissable, that hatred drove both teams to play football of rare brilliance. It\u2019s a win-win, at least for me. Three things make great sport: intensity, quality and drama. And a bit of mutual loathing is usually good for all three. 43 min This is getting a bit niggly. Bernardo Silva shoves Origi over by the corner flag and is penalised. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s deep free-kick is headed back across goal and claimed comfortably by Bravo. 42 min Guardiola is booked for his protests. I didn\u2019t know you could book managers. Even by his standards, Pep seems a little taut at the moment. A 10-point lead by November might calm him down. 40 min David Silva receives treatment after kicking the underside of Gomez\u2019s foot. Pep Guardiola is fuming and takes it out on the fourth official. I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s talking about, in truth - they both went for a high ball and Gomez got there just before Silva. 39 min A lovely through ball from Stones finds De Bruyne, who is just offside. 36 min A bit of a quiet period in the game. The only new boy, Rodri, has looked comfortable without doing anything eye-catching. That\u2019s not really his game. 33 min De Bruyne is booked for a naughty trip on Origi. 32 min This has been a very open, enjoyable game. All it\u2019s missing is a bit of unnecessary needle. 29 min Salah completes a hat-trick of missed chances, flicking over the bar with the outside of his left foot after a poor header from Zinchenko. He could have played it square to Firmino, but I wouldn\u2019t be too critical: he suffers from a rare medical conditions which means he loses all peripheral vision every time he enters the penalty area. 27 min This is a better spell for Liverpool, who are enjoying some leisurely possession for the first time in the game. \u201cMan City are on their way to turning into a ruthless championship-winning machine, if they already aren\u2019t there,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cI just can\u2019t see them losing even on days they\u2019re \u2018decent\u2019, because simple decency for them exists on another plane compared to the rest out there. Going by their quality and their performances, are they the best team in the world at the moment?\u201d Depends which team you mean. I think Domestic City are the best in the world; European City are not. 25 min \u201cSo, not content with having the most stylish team and manager in the league, City also now have the most stylish kit in the Premier,\u201d says Michael Jenkins. \u201cThey really don\u2019t want to leave even crumbs for the rest, do they?\u201d Well\u2026 22 min Salah and Firmino have looked really lively. Liverpool\u2019s problem is in midfield, where they are being outplayed. 20 min \u201cPersonally I think Liverpool punched well over their weight last year,\u201d says Andrew Lingard. \u201cI reckon City will run away with it this year.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t shock me. City are almost nailed on to get at least 90 points; the imponderable is whether Liverpool can indeed go again. 17 min Good save from Alisson! Gabriel Jesus played a nice through ball to De Bruyne, who was trying to get the ball out of his feet when Robertson made a good challenge from the side. The ball ran along the area to Sterling, whose first-time shot towards the near post was beaten away by the sprawling Alisson. 15 min This is great fun. Salah scorches away from Zinchenko on the right, cuts into the box and whips a shot that hits the outside of the near post. Bravo had it covered but it was a blistering run from Salah. 14 min City look much sharper than Liverpool at the moment. Given Liverpool\u2019s lamentable pre-season form, I think we have to ask an uncomfortable question: has Jurgen Klopp taken this side as far as he can? 13 min Gabriel Jesus replaces Leroy Sane. Liverpool\u2019s defenders were half asleep for that goal, while Alisson will also be a bit annoyed that Sterling\u2019s shot wriggled past him. Raheem Sterling puts City ahead. It came from a neat free-kick by City. The ball was played short to Walker, who curled it over the top to find Zinchenko on the left of the area. He headed it back across goal, David Silva helped it on at the near post and Sterling sidefooted a volley through Alisson from six yards. 11 min \u201cWhat happened to Man City\u2019s shirt sponsors?\u201d says Manoj Narayan. \u201cIs their lack of advertising on the shirt a temporary arrangement or will we see it for the whole year?\u201d It\u2019$ a one-off. Looks great, though. 10 min Sane is struggling here. He landed awkwardly after being fouled by Alexander-Arnold, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to continue. That will be a relief to Alexander-Arnold, who was starting to get a bit of a chasing. 8 min Salah misses an excellent chance, sidefooting wide from 10 yards after more smart work from Firmino. Salah took it first time, which is why he dragged it past the near post. 6 min Lovely play from Firmino. He flies through the air to control the ball at neck height before moving it back onto his left foot and swishing a shot from the edge of the area that is patted down by Bravo. 4 min A half-chance for City. Sterling nicks the ball off Gomez, 30 yards from goal, and plays in Sane on the left side of the box. He gallops past Alexander-Arnold before crashing the ball into the side netting from a tight angle. 3 min Rodri has had a couple of early touches, simple one-touch passes that Spanish holding midfielders play so well. 1 min John Stones, who was last seen having a stinker for England in Portugal, is pressed in his own six-yard box by Origi and Firmino, but calmly passes the ball between them to find Kevin De Bruyne. Takes moxie, that. 1 min Peep peep! Liverpool raise the curtain, kicking from right to left. They are in red; City are wearing their very smart 125th-anniversary kit. After the usual performance of the national anthem, booed as always by the Liverpool fans, the players shake hands and take their positions. \u201cSo, Claudio Bravo in goal,\u201d says Robert Hisnay. \u201cAnd Phil Foden on the bench. Thoughts?\u201d Ederson was never going to start, and David Silva is ahead of Foden, no? It\u2019s an important season for Foden, though. He needs more than three Premier League starts. There\u2019s plenty of other live sport going on, if you\u2019re into all that It\u2019s not exactly the Audi Cup, to be fair Some pre-match reading Liverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Origi. Substitutes: Mignolet, Lovren, Keita, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Shaqiri, Matip. Manchester City (4-1-2-3) Bravo; Walker, Stones, Otamendi, Zinchenko; Rodri; De Bruyne, D Silva; B Silva, Sterling, Sane. Substitutes: Ederson, Gundogan, Jesus, Aguero, Angelino, Foden, E Garcia. Hello. The Premier League is the richest and most popular league in the world. But there\u2019s one thing money can\u2019t buy: hate. English football has not had a classic rivalry since Arsenal and Manchester United\u2019s mutual enmity fizzled out in 2005. And although we\u2019re unlikely to see a decade-long feud like that again, there is a real chance that, for the next few years, Liverpool and Manchester City could provide the kind of rivalry that elevates sport to the highest possible level. The signs are good. They are the champions of Europe and England respectively, and arguably the two best teams in the world. They have already taken part in an extraordinary title race, not to mention an immense, intense Champions League quarter-final, and are likely to form their own mini-league again this season. Today they meet in the Community Shield, the match all journalists are contractually obliged to describe as the curtain-raiser for a new season. And although the game means nothing, it might tell us something about the relationship between the sides. When their rivalry was at its peak, Arsenal and United usually turned this match into a pre-season unfriendly. Football has changed since Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira compared testosterone levels, and the burgeoning rivalry between City and Liverpool has been defined as much as anything by mutual respect. But things might be about to get a little saltier. There was some needle in City\u2019s vital league win at the Etihad in January, and there have been a few words in the build-up to this game. Anfield will not want for atmosphere when City visit in November. And if it all kicks off today, we\u2019ll know something special is brewing. Kick off is at 3pm.",

      "bodyText": "A mass shooting at a Walmart in the Texas border city of El Paso that has left 21 people dead and 26 injured is being investigated as a possible hate crime, Texas officials said. A 21-year-old white man is in custody after the mass shooting, one of the deadliest incidents in Texas history, El Paso\u2019s police chief said. Local news outlets reported the name of the suspected shooter, but his name has not yet been officially released by law enforcement. He was named by the Associated Press and other media as Patrick Crusius, citing law enforcement sources. A local TV station published what it said was a picture of the suspect from CCTV footage. There was \u201clittle to minimum force\u201d used when law enforcement took the suspect into custody, an El Paso police spokesman, Robert Gomez, said at an earlier press conference. \u201cNo law enforcement personnel fired their weapon.\u201d \u201cIt happened without incident so I can assume that the person dropped his weapons,\u201d Gomez added. Law enforcement officials are investigating \u201ca manifesto from this individual\u201d that suggests the incident may be a hate crime, the police chief, Greg Allen, said. He added that law enforcement still needed to \u201cvalidate for certain\u201d that the document under investigation was from the arrested suspect. The chief did not immediately offer more details on the document under investigation. Investigators are \u201creasonably confident\u201d that the Walmart shooting suspect posted the document on 8chan, an extremist online message board that often features racist content, senior law enforcement officials told NBC News. If the manifesto is authentic, it would make it the third mass shooting announced in advance on 8chan in less than five months. In response to the document, 8chan commenters speculated whether the shooting would produce an impressive body count, mocked the shooter, and wrote \u201cHello FBI\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s it. This website is getting shutdown,\u201d one 8chan commenter wrote. Since mid-morning, commenters on 8chan had been circulating a document posted to the site that referenced Texas and a planned shooting attack motivated by white nationalist ideology. The 8chan document under investigation by Texas law enforcement described a gun attack that was intended to be \u201ca response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas\u201d. Its author described a hatred of race-mixing, and suggested that the United States should be separated into different territories for different races. His opinions on immigration predated Donald Trump\u2019s run for president, the author wrote. El Paso is in western Texas, right on the border with Mexico. The diverse city has around 680,000 residents, and its population is around 80% Latino. More than 23,000 pedestrians cross from its Mexican twin city, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, across the border to El Paso to work every day. The document includes an expression of support for the Christchurch gunman, whose attack on peaceful worshippers in New Zealand left 51 people dead in March. The alleged Christchurch gunman also described immigrants of color as an \u201cinvasion\u201d. Trump has continued to refer to migrants at the United States\u2019 southern border as an \u201cinvasion\u201d, including in the immediate wake of the Christchurch shooting. El Paso has been at the center of the crisis over the Trump administration\u2019s punitive treatment of migrants and refugees from Central America.

After that shooting, media reports highlighted an Instagram post from an account with the same name as the alleged shooter, which referenced a late-19th century white supremacist text and described mixed-race people in derogatory terms. Suspects in two previous white supremacist shootings, the Christchurch shooting, and an April shooting targeting synagogue in Poway, California, that left one person dead and three injured, both posted documents on 8chan before the attacks. Posts linked to the suspect in a November mass shooting attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which left 11 Jewish worshippers dead, also referred to immigrants and refugees as \u201cinvaders\u201d. Those posts were made on Gab, a different extremist social network. Early reports suggested the gun used in the shooting was a rifle, but police could not immediately confirm the make or model of the weapon, police officials said. The police chief said only one weapon had been identified. An image of the word \u201cTrump\u201d spelled out in guns, circulating on Sunday as the work of the shooter, was in fact initially created in January 2017, and posted on the \u201cWeakend Gunnit\u201d subreddit, where gun fans share memes and softcore porn. Since then it has regularly shown up in other corners of the rightwing web, including the main Trump subreddits and several popular Twitter accounts.

      "body": "<p>The victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales is to call for increased support for domestic abuse victims after a woman went into hiding when her violent ex-partner was released from prison early.</p> <p>Dame Vera Baird will meet Abigail Blake on Monday to discuss her case and ways to improve experiences for other victims. </p> <p>Blake sustained a broken back and neck and was left permanently disabled after Sebastian Swamy attacked her at their home in July 2017. He removed her mobile phone so she could not call 999, and she was rescued by neighbours as she lay unconscious outside the property with a severed spinal cord, five broken ribs and a punctured lung.</p> <p>Six months after he was sentenced to three years and four months in prison, Swamy was granted early release. Blake, 42, a mother of two, said her case raised serious concerns about the way the justice system supports domestic violence victims.</p> <p>Baird, the victims\u2019 commissioner, has said victims need more support to feel safe. </p> <p>\u201cWe all have a duty to ensure they feel safe and supported when they make the often painful decision to report the crimes being committed against them,\u201d Baird said. \u201cThis means having appropriate public protection arrangements to keep them safe and give them peace of mind. And it is important the criminal justice system recognises the suffering of victims and their children by handing down appropriate sentences for convicted perpetrators.\u201d</p> <p>Swamy, a telecoms executive, was initially charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent but admitted a lesser charge of grievous bodily harm (GBH), saying he had been drinking heavily on the night of the attack.</p> <p>Blake, from Knutsford in Cheshire, only met CPS lawyers on the day Swamy was sentenced in January this year. She received no legal advice and was urged by the police to accept his plea bargain to avoid the trauma of a trial. She believed Swamy would spend a minimum of 20 months of a three-year sentence in prison.</p> <p>However, the time Swamy had spent on bail wearing an electronic tag was taken into account as part of his custodial sentence and he was granted early release.</p> <p>Swamy was given a travel warrant and was allowed to make his way from Wrexham prison to his family home in Berkshire without a police escort, prompting Blake to go into hiding for 24 hours with her infant son. </p> <p>Swamy is now once again wearing a tag and is under a home detention curfew. He was also handed an indefinite restraining order and any breach of this would result in a recall to prison.</p> <p>Before his release, Blake was not consulted about the licensing arrangement, as is usual practice.</p> <p>She said: \u201cHe left me for dead and now he is out. This is a daily hell, and will be for years. Forever looking over my back, laying in bed paralysed hearing sounds. Scared to death for the children and I. This is not living, this is existing, all while for Sebastian it\u2019s the start of a new life having had zero punishment [as a result of] his abysmal sentencing.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to know who is responsible for not providing me with the correct information regarding [the sentence]. Why wasn\u2019t I consequently given the option to take it to trial? I had endured more than a lifetime\u2019s trauma, no trial could have made it worse. I wanted to at least the opportunity to fight for what he deserved. However, due to the inadequate information I received, I wasn\u2019t even able to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Newlove, a former victims\u2019 commissioner, said the case had highlighted flaws in the justice system.</p> <p>\u201cTime and time again, after speaking to many victims and survivors of this horrendous [domestic] abuse, the one thing that they constantly told me was that no one communicated with them,\u201d said Newlove, the patron of Resolve, a national antisocial behaviour and community safety organisation.</p> <p>\u201cAs we see in this case, did the CPS really expect Abigail to fully understand the implications around the sentence? And knowing that the victim has no legal rights, yet again the victim\u2019s voice has been silenced.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "The victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales is to call for increased support for domestic abuse victims after a woman went into hiding when her violent ex-partner was released from prison early. Dame Vera Baird will meet Abigail Blake on Monday to discuss her case and ways to improve experiences for other victims. Blake sustained a broken back and neck and was left permanently disabled after Sebastian Swamy attacked her at their home in July 2017. He removed her mobile phone so she could not call 999, and she was rescued by neighbours as she lay unconscious outside the property with a severed spinal cord, five broken ribs and a punctured lung. Six months after he was sentenced to three years and four months in prison, Swamy was granted early release. Blake, 42, a mother of two, said her case raised serious concerns about the way the justice system supports domestic violence victims. Baird, the victims\u2019 commissioner, has said victims need more support to feel safe. \u201cWe all have a duty to ensure they feel safe and supported when they make the often painful decision to report the crimes being committed against them,\u201d Baird said. \u201cThis means having appropriate public protection arrangements to keep them safe and give them peace of mind. And it is important the criminal justice system recognises the suffering of victims and their children by handing down appropriate sentences for convicted perpetrators.\u201d Swamy, a telecoms executive, was initially charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent but admitted a lesser charge of grievous bodily harm (GBH), saying he had been drinking heavily on the night of the attack. Blake, from Knutsford in Cheshire, only met CPS lawyers on the day Swamy was sentenced in January this year. She received no legal advice and was urged by the police to accept his plea bargain to avoid the trauma of a trial. She believed Swamy would spend a minimum of 20 months of a three-year sentence in prison. However, the time Swamy had spent on bail wearing an electronic tag was taken into account as part of his custodial sentence and he was granted early release. Swamy was given a travel warrant and was allowed to make his way from Wrexham prison to his family home in Berkshire without a police escort, prompting Blake to go into hiding for 24 hours with her infant son. Swamy is now once again wearing a tag and is under a home detention curfew. He was also handed an indefinite restraining order and any breach of this would result in a recall to prison. Before his release, Blake was not consulted about the licensing arrangement, as is usual practice. She said: \u201cHe left me for dead and now he is out. This is a daily hell, and will be for years. Forever looking over my back, laying in bed paralysed hearing sounds. Scared to death for the children and I. This is not living, this is existing, all while for Sebastian it\u2019s the start of a new life having had zero punishment [as a result of] his abysmal sentencing. \u201cI would like to know who is responsible for not providing me with the correct information regarding [the sentence]. Why wasn\u2019t I consequently given the option to take it to trial? I had endured more than a lifetime\u2019s trauma, no trial could have made it worse. I wanted to at least the opportunity to fight for what he deserved. However, due to the inadequate information I received, I wasn\u2019t even able to do that.\u201d Helen Newlove, a former victims\u2019 commissioner, said the case had highlighted flaws in the justice system. \u201cTime and time again, after speaking to many victims and survivors of this horrendous [domestic] abuse, the one thing that they constantly told me was that no one communicated with them,\u201d said Newlove, the patron of Resolve, a national antisocial behaviour and community safety organisation. \u201cAs we see in this case, did the CPS really expect Abigail to fully understand the implications around the sentence? And knowing that the victim has no legal rights, yet again the victim\u2019s voice has been silenced.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The new Conservative chair, James Cleverly, has been strongly criticised after apparently reneging on a promise given for an independent inquiry focusing on Islamophobia in the party. Boris Johnson backed the proposal along with the four other candidates still in the race when it was raised by Sajid Javid during the BBC Tory leadership debate in June. In an interview on Sunday, Cleverly said there would be an independent inquiry but he did not explicitly confirm that it would be be specific to Islamophobia rather than a general inquiry into racism. Subsequently, a party source told the Guardian that the party was considering options for \u201can investigation into all types of prejudice and discrimination\u201d, rather than the Islamophobia-specific one that the Muslim Council of Britain has been calling for. A spokesman for the MCB said the party needed to clarify exactly what was being proposed, and it would be a travesty if Johnson did not honour the promise given during the BBC debate. \u201cThere are over 100 incidents of Islamophobia that we have identified yourselves in the past year alone,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe Conservative party\u2019s approach to Islamophobia has thus far been one of denial and obfuscation.

The MCB has been calling for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party for more than a year, claiming that multiple incidents show that party officials are not doing enough to reprimand or remove those who express Islamophobic views. A YouGov poll this year suggesting that 54% of Conservative party members think Islam is \u201cgenerally a threat to the British way of life\u201d has also been cited as evidence that Islamophobia is entrenched in the party. Asked about this finding, Cleverly told Sky that the Tories did not share their membership data with YouGov and that therefore there was some doubt as to whether those surveyed for the poll were all party members. He said the party took a \u201crobust line\u201d with people who said inappropriate things.",

And you will be poorer by the end of the year if a no-deal EU exit comes to pass. If you have savings in sterling, then you\u2019re in even more trouble. </p> \n<p>In the post-truth world we have been living in for the past three years, there\u2019s one thing that cannot be blagged away, cannot be accused of bias, cannot be propped up by a gust of groundless optimism \u2013 the British pound. It is quite literally a sovereign, bowing to no ideology or political pressure. As elegantly and neutrally as a force of nature, it rises and falls as it divines the direction of the country\u2019s economy. That direction, according to the pound\u2019s nosedive over the past few weeks, is downwards.</p> \n<p>You might not yet have noticed what economists call \u201cthe pass-through effect\u201d, the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/30/like-sterling-talk-of-no-deal-brexit-could-cost-boris-johnson-dear\" title=\"\">changes in the exchange rate</a> on domestic prices for traded and non-traded goods. But it is here. We are all experiencing it now, in some way. It\u2019s not just holidaymakers, many of whom are shocked that they are getting fewer euros than pounds at airport exchange bureaux or ATMs (in the past week, even dollars were informally trading at parity, a significant milestone in the pound\u2019s depreciation).</p> \n<p>Many holidaymakers will probably be well off enough to cope with the downturn. But it\u2019s affecting those who can\u2019t afford foreign travel, too. Because it hits everyone\u2019s food basket, clothes shopping, energy bills. Bank of England <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/report/2018/eu-withdrawal-scenarios-and-monetary-and-financial-stability.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=B5F6EDCDF90DCC10286FC0BC599D94CAB8735DFB\" title=\"\">estimates</a> are that a 5% depreciation eventually adds almost 1% to the price of consumer goods. Many people distrust the Bank\u2019s forecasts. The institution made some erroneous assumptions when predicting a dramatic post-referendum slowdown. But Project Fear wasn\u2019t entirely wrong. The rise in inflation after the 2016 vote has already cost the average household <a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit11.pdf\" title=\"\">\u00a3404 a year</a>. In just the past few days, as the prospects of no deal have increased, the pound <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/01/pound-sinks-to-fresh-low-against-dollar-amid-no-deal-brexit-fears-sterling\" title=\"\">slipped again</a> against the dollar.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/04/boris-johnson-armageddon-clock-what-is-it-counting-down-to\">Boris Johnson\u2019s Armageddon Clock: what is it really counting down to? | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We don\u2019t quite register these changes because they don\u2019t hit us in a dramatic way. Like the apocryphal story of frogs in gradually heating water, boiled alive because they don\u2019t register the temperature rise, we also may not realise what is happening until it\u2019s too late. And even then we may not understand why, particularly if Brexiteer misinformation distracts us from the real cause. A gradual decline in living standards can have many fathers, and a hard-right government will almost certainly point the finger at immigrants, the EU, or simply those who \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/04/how-does-the-rest-of-the-world-currently-view-the-uk-brexit-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">talk Britain down</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>We also fail to fully absorb the danger of a depreciation because of an entrenched conventional wisdom that, despite the chaos of the past three years, the Tories are a safe pair of hands on the economy. During the party\u2019s leadership campaign, Nick Macpherson, a former permanent secretary to the Treasury, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickmacpherson2/status/1151099302414114816\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> that Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson seem \u201cdetermined to debauch\u201d the pound. There is a whole other article to be written comparing how differently the media, civil service and the public would react if the economic headlines of recent years had been written under a Jeremy Corbyn, or indeed any Labour, government.</p> \n<p>Can you imagine a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/26/boris-johnson-given-cold-shoulder-by-fed-up-cabinet-colleagues\" title=\"\">fuck business</a>\u201d Labour prime minister? A sudden unbudgeted splurge of billions of pounds to distract voters from the needless economic shock they\u2019re about to face? The current sterling depreciation would almost certainly have been called a \u201crun on the pound\u201d by now. Ironically, the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, claimed a Corbyn government would cause \u201ca crash in the value of the pound, causing a shockwave of inflation\u201d.</p> \n<p>Back in the real world, the pound is already being treated like a volatile emerging markets currency. Last week Edinburgh festival artists refused to be paid in sterling, demanding euros and dollars. The \u201cdebauching\u201d of the pound is fully under way.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"505b1c3b-ee22-4e7b-9b23-fda0d0a3b5c0\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>How much will I get for my money on holiday?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The immediate impact of a weakened pound is on holidaymakers heading to Spain and other destinations in the EU, but a collapse in the currency also has much wider implications for household finances.</p>\n    <p>At some UK airports, the pound has already been seen at worth less than a euro, and the same as a dollar.

In July&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling\">Sterling</a>&nbsp;had its worst month since October 2016 as it lost 4.3%. But it could get a whole lot worse.

Those price tags on clothes in euros, sterling and other currencies? It won\u2019t be long before they are adjusted again, with the price in sterling inevitably having to rise. There is a lag effect here \u2013 so the rise won\u2019t be immediate, but it will flow through eventually.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Will interest rates go up to \u2018save the pound\u2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Historically, a sterling crisis usually prompted a rise in interest rates to encourage foreign speculators to hold the pound. But we\u2019re now in very different territory. With the US and European central banks inclined to cut rates, there\u2019s virtually a zero chance of a rate rise by the Bank of England.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Are there any winners?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yes, tourists are the winners \u2013 just not British ones.

The Bank of England\u2019s forecasts are always wrong; the EU will blink at one minute to midnight; a weak pound is good for British exports. The same hubris that assumed Britain could just unhitch from the EU and make up for it through trade elsewhere underpins this outdated view of an export-boosting pound. The world has changed: very few economies, and certainly not Britain\u2019s, are pure exporters any more.</p> \n<p>Exports are made up of imports. Made up of parts, intellectual property, raw materials, labour \u2013 all becoming more expensive because of the falling pound. Depreciation will not only fail to render British exports more competitive, it will make them more expensive. History bears this out. Neither the depreciation following the 2008 financial crash, nor that after the 2016 referendum, significantly boosted the country\u2019s exports.</p> \n<p>There is no way out of the inevitable impoverishment of average British wage earners \u2013 who cannot demand their wages be paid in a different currency, or hedge by opening a foreign currency account \u2013 if a sterling fall continues. One might grumble that the constraining effects of globalisation mean there is less flexibility for a successfully integrated economy to write its own rules. But this goes to the heart of the Brexit question \u2013 there is simply no way to unglobalise the whole world so that a single country can \u201ctake back control\u201d. Not without making life harder for those least able to cope with it, especially after almost a decade of austerity.</p> \n<p>As we transition into a parallel universe of a Johnson government running purely on the fumes of propaganda, watch the pound. It will be your lie detector test.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 August 2019.

It is quite literally a sovereign, bowing to no ideology or political pressure. As elegantly and neutrally as a force of nature, it rises and falls as it divines the direction of the country\u2019s economy. That direction, according to the pound\u2019s nosedive over the past few weeks, is downwards. You might not yet have noticed what economists call \u201cthe pass-through effect\u201d, the impact of changes in the exchange rate on domestic prices for traded and non-traded goods. But it is here. We are all experiencing it now, in some way. It\u2019s not just holidaymakers, many of whom are shocked that they are getting fewer euros than pounds at airport exchange bureaux or ATMs (in the past week, even dollars were informally trading at parity, a significant milestone in the pound\u2019s depreciation). Many holidaymakers will probably be well off enough to cope with the downturn. But it\u2019s affecting those who can\u2019t afford foreign travel, too. Because it hits everyone\u2019s food basket, clothes shopping, energy bills. Bank of England estimates are that a 5% depreciation eventually adds almost 1% to the price of consumer goods. Many people distrust the Bank\u2019s forecasts. The institution made some erroneous assumptions when predicting a dramatic post-referendum slowdown. But Project Fear wasn\u2019t entirely wrong. The rise in inflation after the 2016 vote has already cost the average household \u00a3404 a year. In just the past few days, as the prospects of no deal have increased, the pound slipped again against the dollar. We don\u2019t quite register these changes because they don\u2019t hit us in a dramatic way. Like the apocryphal story of frogs in gradually heating water, boiled alive because they don\u2019t register the temperature rise, we also may not realise what is happening until it\u2019s too late. And even then we may not understand why, particularly if Brexiteer misinformation distracts us from the real cause. A gradual decline in living standards can have many fathers, and a hard-right government will almost certainly point the finger at immigrants, the EU, or simply those who \u201ctalk Britain down\u201d. We also fail to fully absorb the danger of a depreciation because of an entrenched conventional wisdom that, despite the chaos of the past three years, the Tories are a safe pair of hands on the economy. During the party\u2019s leadership campaign, Nick Macpherson, a former permanent secretary to the Treasury, tweeted that Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson seem \u201cdetermined to debauch\u201d the pound. There is a whole other article to be written comparing how differently the media, civil service and the public would react if the economic headlines of recent years had been written under a Jeremy Corbyn, or indeed any Labour, government. Can you imagine a \u201cfuck business\u201d Labour prime minister? A sudden unbudgeted splurge of billions of pounds to distract voters from the needless economic shock they\u2019re about to face? The current sterling depreciation would almost certainly have been called a \u201crun on the pound\u201d by now. Ironically, the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, claimed a Corbyn government would cause \u201ca crash in the value of the pound, causing a shockwave of inflation\u201d. Back in the real world, the pound is already being treated like a volatile emerging markets currency. Last week Edinburgh festival artists refused to be paid in sterling, demanding euros and dollars. The \u201cdebauching\u201d of the pound is fully under way. There is now a pretty predictable list of responses to bad Brexit news. The Bank of England\u2019s forecasts are always wrong; the EU will blink at one minute to midnight; a weak pound is good for British exports. The same hubris that assumed Britain could just unhitch from the EU and make up for it through trade elsewhere underpins this outdated view of an export-boosting pound. The world has changed: very few economies, and certainly not Britain\u2019s, are pure exporters any more. Exports are made up of imports. Made up of parts, intellectual property, raw materials, labour \u2013 all becoming more expensive because of the falling pound. Depreciation will not only fail to render British exports more competitive, it will make them more expensive. History bears this out. Neither the depreciation following the 2008 financial crash, nor that after the 2016 referendum, significantly boosted the country\u2019s exports. There is no way out of the inevitable impoverishment of average British wage earners \u2013 who cannot demand their wages be paid in a different currency, or hedge by opening a foreign currency account \u2013 if a sterling fall continues. One might grumble that the constraining effects of globalisation mean there is less flexibility for a successfully integrated economy to write its own rules. But this goes to the heart of the Brexit question \u2013 there is simply no way to unglobalise the whole world so that a single country can \u201ctake back control\u201d. Not without making life harder for those least able to cope with it, especially after almost a decade of austerity. As we transition into a parallel universe of a Johnson government running purely on the fumes of propaganda, watch the pound. It will be your lie detector test. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 8 August 2019.

It\u2019s not the same if you hold an object under the sun as when you hold it in the shade.\u201d</p> <p>He sought to demonstrate this through artworks ranging from paintings and sculpture to light installations and architectural interventions, all characterised by their geometric abstraction and a vivid repetitive palette. In 1974 Cruz-Diez painted red, orange, green and black stripes across the walls and floor of the main terminal at <a href=\"http://www.cruz-diez.com/biography/photographies/xp/1970-1979/carlos-cruz-diez-in-front-of-his-muro-de-color-aditivo/\" title=\"\">Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport</a> in Caracas, a pattern he returned to in 2014 for a commission to decorate a boat, <a href=\"https://www.biennial.com/collaborations/carlos-cruz-diez\" title=\"\">the Dazzle Ship</a>, in the manner of camouflage in Liverpool\u2019s dockyard as part of the city\u2019s biennial.

The intensity of the fluorescent bulbs changed the appearance of anything brought into these environments.

This was a natural progression from <a href=\"http://www.cruz-diez.com/work/physichromie/\" title=\"\">the Physichromie series</a> that Cruz-Diez had started six years earlier. Here, the artist attached strips of wood painted in alternative colours at right-angles to the surface of a support. The dominant palette of wall-based work changed depending on the position of the viewer. Traditional painting, the artist wrote, merely represents \u201ca memory\u201d, whereas he hoped that with his work \u201cwhat you see \u2026 is in the present\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Caracas, Carlos was the son of Carlos Cruz Lander and Mariana Diez de Cruz. His father, a chemist and amateur poet, encouraged his son\u2019s interest in art. The younger Carlos enrolled at the city\u2019s School of Fine Arts in 1940.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company today - we\u2019ll be back when the fun resumes four weeks today, after the summer holiday. So there we go \u2013 another great race, and another great race which further cements Lewis Hamilton\u2019s status as champion-elect. It\u2019s going to be six driver championships for the stormer from Stevenage, and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do about it. But he\u2019ll know already that next season might be different, because Max Verstappen is coming. F1\u2019s next great rivalry is surely upon us, and doesn\u2019t the sport need it! Here\u2019s Giles Richards\u2019 race report... And our driver standings... Hamilton 250 Bottas 188 Verstappen 181 Vettel 156 Leclerc 132 Gasly 63 Sainz 58 Raikkonen 31 Phew. That was another absolute jazzer of a race. Let\u2019s have some full results... Hamilton Verstappen Vettel Leclerc Sainz Gasly Raikkonen Bottas Norris Albon Perez Hulkenberg Magnussen Ricciardo Kvyat Russell Stroll Giovinazzi Kubica \u201cI feel really grateful for the day,\u201d says Hamilton, and for the team for continuing to believe in me and for continuing to push the limits and to take a risk, a chance on me - we\u2019ve been together seven years and it always feels like a new win.\u201d \u201cCongrats to Lewis for the win, he was pushing us very hard,\u201d says Verstappen. \u201cWe treid the one stop so of course they had the opportunity to try the two and it worked.\u201d \u201cThey rolled the dice,\u201d Verstappen is told, and his team praise his drive today. I wonder if he\u2019s wondering why they weren\u2019t thinking about how Mercedes would play things. \u201cOnly you can make that happen ... brilliant drive,\u201d Hamilton\u2019s team tells him. \u201cJames, sorry I doubted your strategy,\u201d he respoods. \u201cThat feels so good guys, I hope you\u2019re feeling it too. An absolutely brilliant drive from the champ, and a fine intervention by his team! Verstappen is second, Vettel third, Leclerc fourth, Sainz fifth and Gasly sixth. Lap 69/70 Verstappen charges in pursuit of the fastest lap, while Hamilton is going to be champion again. Still, even before this season is done, we can be excited for next season because something is very definitely happening with the yungun. Lap 68/70 He\u2019s been closing for quite some time and now Vettel nails his Ferrari team-mate! He passes Leclerc and provided he stays on the track has snided him of a podium finish! Lap 68/70 Verstappen says he can\u2019t finish on these tyres and comes in. He must be so disappointed, but he\u2019ll learn from it. Lap 67/70 Verstappen led for 67 laps, but it\u2019s not going to matter! His should\u2019ve seen Mercedes\u2019 strategy coming, pre-empted it, and now he\u2019d be done! But they didn\u2019t. Lap 67/70 Hamilton is so close now, and Verstappen has nothing to help him beyond his own positioning on the track. And as they come down the straight, HAMILTON TAKES HIM OUT! VERSTAPPEN CANNOT RESPOND, AND THIS RACE IS DONE! Lap 66/70 Hamilton is guzzling this gap now! 1.026s the gap, almost within DRS range, and Verstappen must be bricking it! Lap 65/70 Verstappen needs to steal himself because it\u2019s nearly time! Can he hold off Hamilton on the straights by taking up the best positions? 2.788s the gap, and this is brilliant stuff! Lap 64/70 5.486s the gap; \u201cTyres are dead\u201d, Verstappen tells his team, and Hamilton is going to do this isn\u2019t he?! Lap 63/70 Hamilton can\u2019t quite see Verstappen, but he\u2019s not far off. He\u2019s getting nervous - you can tell by the way he\u2019s asking his team about his bakes, who\u2019re telling him to forget them. Lap 62/70 Here comes Hamilton, the gap now below nine seconds, and striking distance is expected in six laps! That\u2019ll give him two goes at taking Verstappen out, and given the speed difference between them, you\u2019d think he\u2019ll pull it off! What a great call that pit was! Lap 61/70 Hamilton gets the gap below 11s for the first time and this is our full leaderboard: Verstappen Hamilton Leclerc Vettel Sainz Gasly Raikkonen Norris Bottas Perez Lap 60/70 Hamilton is tearing into Verstappen now, his team telling him that, by the end, the Red Bull will be down to zero rubber. 11.296s the gap, and this is getting extremely lively. Lap 59/70 Vettel is charing after Leclerc, looking to nab third, while Hamilton cuts the lead to 12.560s. Lap 58/70 Hamilton sets a new fastest lap and brings the gap down to 14.433s. My sense is that it\u2019ll be just enough for Verstappen because a second a lap won\u2019t do it, but perhaps the Red Bull tyres will knacker enough so bigger chunks can be cut off. Lap 57/70 Verstappen leads by 15.506s and is on at his team to describe the gap. He\u2019s so conscious of how important this is, but needs to maintain the equilibrium that\u2019s got him this far. Lap 56/70 Horner says Verstappen has managed the race well and now has clear road to \u201cstretch his legs\u201d. Lap 55/70 Perhaps Verstappen has seen away the worst now; he\u2019s driving better than he did through the middle part of the race and Christian Horner is looking forward to watching the denouement. He thinks Mercedes rolled the dice because they couldn\u2019t catch his man, and wasn\u2019t tempted to bring Verstappen in because he\u2019d have come out behind. Lap 54/70 Verstappen humps through a decent lap and has now cleared the track of the back markers who were giving him a fair bit of nause. Lap 53/70 The gap\u2019s down to 16.018s at Verstappen prepares to lap Vettel, in fourth; Ferrari have had better weekends. Lap 52/70 Hamilton sets the fastest lap of the race so far as Grosjean is retired. That gap between 1 and 2 is reducing all the time, down to 17.057, and we\u2019re going to see how Verstappen responds to pressure! Lap 51/70 The lead is now 18.269 and Hamilton is lapping more than a second faster. This is going to be tight! Lap 50/70 Hamilton isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s made the right move, challenging the call made by his team, while Verstappen is challenging his team too. I\u2019d say Hamilton\u2019s strategy looks good, because he wasn\u2019t catching up and this new effort gives him a chance. Lap 49/70 Hamilton pits! He comes out on fresh tyres, comes out ahead of Leclerc, and have Mercedes stolen a march on Red Bull there? He might just have the pace to close the gap, now at 20.269s, and Verstappen stays out a lap longer; if he goes in now, he\u2019ll come out behind, so perhaps he\u2019s just going to hang on! Lap 48/70 Our leaderboard: Verstappen Hamilton Leclerc Vettel Sainz Gasly Raikkonen Norris Lap 47/70 Hamilton has a pace advantage down the straight, but can\u2019t get close enough to attack. His car is quicker, but not by enough. Lap 46/70 Hamilton comes again, cutting the gap to 1.026, but doesn\u2019t look to quite have the pace. What we\u2019re watching here is what we might just be watching for the next five years, because these look a class above the rest. This could be a seriously special rivalry. Lap 45/70 1.042s the lead as we hear about braking issues for Hamilton; maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s narrowing the gap, on account of using them less. Lap 44/70 Bottas is now up to ninth, behind Norris. He\u2019ll need to make up 11s to get that sixth place he\u2019s after. Lap 43/70 This has been another really fun race, and there\u2019s plenty of time left too. We should be good for at least a couple more fights between the front two. Lap 42/70 Verstappen\u2019s lead is up to 1.8s and he\u2019s told by his team that \u201che\u2019s seen the best of his tyres\u201d. Lap 41/70 Hamilton\u2019s told to keep the pressure on and tells his team that he can\u2019t. Verstappen is flustered, but will have taken so much confidence from that last duel. Lap 40/70 Hamilton needs to take a breath here because his tyres will need cleaning - he made a phenomenal effort to inch ahead and Verstappen is absolutely hating the back markers, but showed great resilience hanging in there. Lap 39/70 Hamilton passes Ricciardo and attacks, but Verstappen shuts the door! Hamilton goes again but Verstappen holds it down; Hamilton tries to take a short cut off the track, this is wild, but can\u2019t bring it home, losing time as the lead moves back to 1.279s! Brilliant stuff! Lap 38/70 Hamilton\u2019s tyres are no longer fresh but Ricciardo\u2019s presence mithers Verstappen and the lead is down to 0.31! Lap 37/70 If the front two finish as they currently are the gap in the overall standings will be 53 points. That\u2019s a lot of work for Verstappen to do, but what we\u2019re seeing is just as relevant to next year: Verstappen is coming! Lap 36/70 Hamilton attacks with Verstappen slightly blocked, but he can\u2019t bring it home! He goes too wide and loses some time, the lead now 1.029s. Lap 35/70 This is excellent from Hamilton, who\u2019s on one. The gap is down to 0.698s, and he\u2019s trying to get it done here and now! Lap 34/70 Hamilton wants to push while his tyres are fresh and he cheppies that gap down to 1.170s. Lap 33/70 Bottas does Ricciardo and is up to 11th as Norris diddleds Magnussen to take ninth from him. Lap 32/70 Why didn\u2019t Hamilton come in first, to give himself a lead to hang onto when Verstappen followed him? Lap 31/70 In comes Hamilton! He comes out four seconds letter, which is pretty slow, and the gap is now 5.859s - that\u2019s a lot of work to do, though his tyres are six laps younger. Lap 30/70 Hamilton\u2019s left front brake is now under control. Here\u2019s out list: Hamilton Verstappen Vettel Leclerc Sainz Raikkonen Hulkenberg Gasly Magnussen Ricciardo Norris Bottas Lap 29/70 Current projections suggest that Hamilton will come out three seconds behind Verstappen, a second more than previously. He also has smoke knocking about his car... Lap 28/70 In comes Leclerc as Verstappen cuts a little bit off Hamilton\u2019s lead, and he maintains fourth place. Verstappen just holds, waiting to see when Hamilton stops. Lap 27/70 Hamilton stays out another lap and leads by 18.560s; will he still be in front when he comes out after his pit? Lap 26/70 In goes Verstappen! And out in 2.6s! It\u2019s quick but not that quick, and will he comes out ahead of Leclerc in third? Yes he will! Lap 25/70 The Ferraris are strong on the straight and both overtaking opportunities come at the end of one, so perhaps the leaders are waiting for them to come in before going in themselves. Lap 24/70 Hamilton takes four tenths out of Verstappen, the gap now 1.064. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta say, I\u2019m losing grip,\u201d Verstappen tells his team. \u201cAnd we have understood, Max,\u201d comes back the perfunctory reply. Both cars lap Perez, in 14th, but Hamilton does it quicker. Lap 23/70 No, Hamilton does not pit! Perhaps they\u2019re keeping him out another lap - well they are - but why isn\u2019t quite clear. Well it is, because he\u2019d have come out behind Vettel and in fifth, but what isn\u2019t clear is why it was on the agenda to begin ith. Lap 22/70 1.3s the gap, and it\u2019s looking good for Hamilton ... as he comes in! Lap 21/70 If Verstappen needs to put to change tyres and Hamilton has grip and time, he might just work out a lead that will last him through his own pit. Verstapen won\u2019t want to go in and come out outside both Ferraris, which sit third and fourth. Lap 20/70 And still! This is working out extremely poorly for Bottas, who needs a path through the field, while Hamilton cuts the gap on Verstappen to 1.283s! Verstappen is starting to lose grip, both actually and metaphorically! Lap 19/70 Ricciardo and Bottas fight for 14th and 15th spot... Lap 18/70 Hamilton schleps half a second off Verstappen, the lead now 1.715s as Kviyat does a brilliant job attacking Albon in 12th; they duel for three corners before Kviyat storms through! Lap 17/70 So our leaderboard reads: Verstappen Hamilton Leclerc Vettel Sainz Norris Raikkonen Gasly Grosjean Hulkonen Perez Albon Lap 16/70 Bottas takes out Russell to make 16th place, and will fancy himself to do something still. He\u2019s got no chance of passing Vettel, who\u2019s currently in fourth, but he might well haul himself up to fifth, 20-odd seconds the difference between those two places. Lap 15/70 Christian Horner was relieved to see Verstappen get away in front, and now he hopes he\u2019ll hang into the lead. More news as I get it. Lap 14/70 Hamilton trails Verstappen by 2.306 now, and I reckon he needs to go in first so that when Verstappen pits, he\u2019ll have a lead to defend. Lap 13/70 Verstappen is driving his Red Bull really smartly here, maintaining his lead without hammering his car into the ground. Lap 12/70 Verstappen and Hamilton streak away, but it\u2019s pretty tight everywhere else, with 20 seconds separating Sainz in fifth from Giovinazzi in 18th. Lap 11/70 In 16th place, Ricciardo is gliding pleasantly, passing Stroll. Next in his sight: Kevin Magnussen. Lap 10/70 Bottas is lapping faster than anyone at the moment, and his team reckon he can get sixth place. Meanwhile, Hamilton closes the gap a little, to 2.128s. Lap 9/70 I wonder what Hamilton\u2019s strategy is here. Does he look to go in before Verstappen, or after? Turns out he\u2019s asking his team how he can close the gap, and is told that he\u2019s losing time at turns 5 and 13. Lap 8/70 Already, this looks like a two-horse race. Verstappen and Hamilton are way faster than the rest, but there is, of course, plenty of scope for stuff to go wrong. Leclerc is really struggling here, losing pace all the time, but he\u2019s still two seconds ahead of Vettel, after home come Sainz, Norris, Raikkonen and Gasly. Lap 7/70 Meanwhile, Hamilton stretches clear of Leclerc, nearly 5.5s ahead of him now. Verstappen still leads, by 2.364. Lap 6/70 Bottas pits and comes back on 49.202s off the lead; that was not great work from his team. Lap 5/70 We see that Leclerc hit Bottas rather than the other way around but Bottas stays out for at least another lap. Most drivers will be planning a one-stop strategy, so it\u2019s not the end of the world for him, but gives him enormous work to do to if he\u2019s to hang onto second place in the overall standings; currently, he leads Verstappen by 22 points. Lap 4/70 Verstappen leads Hamilton by 2.237s and Leclerc is 5.356s off the front. Lap 3/70 Bottas will pit for a new front wing - that\u2019ll take him all the way to the back of the field. So our leaderboard reads: Verstappen Hamilton Leclerc Vettel Bottas Sainz Lap 2/70 Gosh, that start went badly for Bottas, whose car is in all sorts of nick. He collided with Leclerc, locked twice, and now he\u2019s fifth, because Vettel has passed him too! Lap 1/70 And off we go, Verstappen bousting clear, and Hamilton goes too, alongside Bottas! They\u2019re three abreast before Verstappen pulls away, then Hamilton and Bottas fight, allowing him further ahead, then Hamilton goes second as Bottas damages his front wing and Leclerc takes him out too! A bit of cloud cover has taken 4 degrees off the track temperature as the cars line up. The formation lap is go! The tyres are being desleeping-bagged... Right then, here we go! The drivers are carred. Bottas is semi-fighting to keep his seat for next term. He\u2019ll probably find out before the next race at Spa, so could use a decent showing here before the summer break. Lance Stroll reckons it\u2019ll be a challenging race given his starting position and the difficulties in overtaking on this track. He\u2019s hoping others have problems. Carlos Sainz doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll rain; thanks, Carlos! Here\u2019s the grid... It\u2019s not Hendrix at Woodstock. Max Verstappen is relaxed, and says that everything is warm. It\u2019s just about anthem time. Anthony Mackie is in the house. \u201cDo you like racing?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a man of few words.\u201d It was cooling down on the track, but the sun\u2019s back out now and Martin Brundle is hot and bothered. I\u2019m not certain a pink shirt was wise. And if you fancy catching up from yesterday... Max Verstappen is phenomenally chill. His cap is problematic, but he thinks he and his team can resolve their starting issues. If he\u2019s ahead going into the first turn, he\u2019ll be in phenomenal shape to stay there. Pole is a much bigger advantage this week than last; overtaking is not easy in Hungary, though the track should quicken up as the race intensifies. Hungaroring might just be the greatest track name. Like the Central African Republic, it does what it says on the tin. Tell you what, today\u2019s little jaunt will have to go some to get near last week\u2019s effort at Hockenheim. But thanks to Hockenheim, our season is revitalised and suddenly anything looks possible. Max Verstappen is an absolute freak of nature, in his fifth season as an F1 driver at the age of 21. And he might just be on the cusp of realising his phenomenal talent, following last week\u2019s win at Hockenheim with pole for today\u2019s race; it might be just too late for a run at this year\u2019s drivers\u2019 championship, but another win will put the rest on notice. Behind Verstappen on the grid, Valtteri Bottas will still fancy his chances of catching Lewis Hamilton, who leads him the overall standings by 39 points. Hamilton has looked in decent shape this weekend, but was left chastising his car for its inability to get him round at requisite pace - though he\u2019s hopeful it\u2019ll be where it needs to be for the race. Start: 2.10pm BST, 3.10pm local time.",

      "body": "<p>I was in my early 20s studying in Paris when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/12/leonard-bernstein-composer-conductor-inspiration-genius-proms\">Leonard Bernstein</a> came to the city to conduct. Whenever Lenny was in Paris, he would come to pay his respects to Nadia Boulanger, the venerable teacher with whom I was studying. She put on a dinner party in his honour and I was one of only two of her students to be invited. I remember being overwhelmed by the concert the night before, when Bernstein conducted Berlioz\u2019s Carnaval Romain, Schumann\u2019s Second Symphony and Shostakovich\u2019s Fifth. He found a way to turn the Orchestre National de France into a world-class thoroughbred, and he opened my ears to Schumann\u2019s often maligned orchestral world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He turned to me and said: \u201cLet\u2019s get outta here!\u201d I had no idea what he had in mind, but we slid out of the room and hailed a taxi.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lenny arrived late at Nadia\u2019s dinner party, perhaps a little the worse for wear. He gave her a bear hug, then lifted her up off the floor and spun her around the room in a mad waltz. My 80-year-old teacher took it all with good grace. She was clearly very fond of Lenny and susceptible to his charisma and extraordinary energy, as were all of us who met him. He seemed restless and easily bored. I watched him picking up student manuscripts lying on the table and muttering rather too audibly: \u201cOh my God, this is the dregs of Faur\u00e9!\u201d</p> <p>At one point during the meal, he turned to me and said: \u201cLet\u2019s get outta here!\u201d I had no idea what he had in mind, but we slid out of the room and hailed a taxi. For the next two hours, we zigzagged around Paris. He was the most engaging, congenial company. He asked me about my way into music. I mentioned that I had met the famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/29/fairouz-diva-middle-east\">Lebanese singer Fairuz</a> in Beirut during a gap year, and that I ended up playing my violinin the tiny band that accompanied her, cross-legged on a carpet on those evenings when she sang at the Casino. Lenny was one of the most wide-ranging eclectic musicians you could ever wish to meet, but it never occurred to me that he would also have known her iconic songs. Yet he did \u2013 and we sang all the ones we could recall at the tops of our voices in the back of the cab as we sped through the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70f78682e7fd6a33afd70093f508ce9d598093fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70f78682e7fd6a33afd70093f508ce9d598093fc/0_47_2924_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leonard Bernstein conducting Boston Symphony in 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leonard Bernstein conducting Boston Symphony in 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was dying to ask him about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/18/how-we-made-west-side-story-stephen-sondheim-chita-rivera-musicals\">West Side Story</a>.

Texas\u2019s governor, Greg Abbott, said 20 people had been killed, and more than two dozen more were injured. The death toll later rose to 21. Mexico\u2019s president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said three Mexicans were among the dead and six were among the wounded. Abbott said it was \u201cone of the deadliest days in Texas history\u201d. Hours later, on Sunday morning, police said nine people had been killed in a separate mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio. The suspect in the El Paso case, a 21-year-old white male from Allen, a suburb of Dallas more than 600 miles away, was taken into custody after surrendering to officers. The El Paso police chief, Greg Allen, said a \u201cmanifesto\u201d was being investigated in connection with the suspect, and the shooting was being investigated as a potential hate crime. \u201cRight now we have a manifesto from this individual, that indicates to some degree, it has a nexus to potential hate crime,\u201d Allen said at an evening press conference on Saturday evening, adding that he would not name the suspect. The alleged gunman was named by the Associated Press and other media as Patrick Crusius, citing law enforcement sources. Allen said the suspect had driven the nine-hour journey to El Paso. El Paso is in western Texas, right on the border with Mexico. The diverse city has around 680,000 residents, and its population is 80% Latino. Its Mexican twin city Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, sits directly across the large barrier that divides their downtown areas. More than 23,000 pedestrians cross from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to El Paso to work every day. Police started receiving reports of a shooting at 10.39 am local time on Saturday, police said. Soon after, the police department tweeted that officers were responding to an active shooting scene and that people were advised to stay away from the area around Cielo Vista Mall, located south of El Paso international airport. The Walmart store, which is part of the mall complex, was busy with families shopping for the new school year. An El Paso police spokesperson, Robert Gomez, estimated there were up to 3000 customers and 100 staff in the store. Initial reports suggested that the weapon used was a rifle, Gomez said. At a late-night briefing near the Walmart parking lot, he told a crowd of reporters gathered in the rain that the bodies of the victims were still inside the store, and that it was possible the number of fatalities could increase. Police confirmed that the shooting was confined to the Walmart and did not take place in other parts of the mall. Gomez said the suspect complied with officers\u2019 demands when he was apprehended. Gomez declined to name the suspect, and said he had not yet been charged. He said it was also unclear whether police had formally interviewed him yet. Jazmin Salas and her mother, Miranda Salas, who had been doing back-to-school shopping together described having to hide together inside a nearby store, before being escorted outside by law enforcement. \u201cIt was very triggering,\u201d Jazmin Salas told KTSM news. The teenager said she felt like she could not trust anyone. \u201cThere are crazy people everywhere.\u201d Cellphone footage broadcast by KTSM showed a man lying flat on the ground, with the sound of at least 10 gunshots in the background. A Walmart employee described hearing gunshots and trying to get as many people as she could out of the store, and seeing customers and employees tumbling over each other in their rush to escape. One of her co-workers was shot in the hand, the employee said. Another woman interviewed described seeing at least two or three bodies lying on the ground. A man who had been at a store in the mall nearby told KTSM that he had heard gunshots and taken out his own gun as he ran towards the parking lot. He said police had briefly questioned him, thinking he was the shooter. A family reunification center had been set up at a nearby middle school center, police said. A University Medical Center of El Paso official told the Associated Press that one of 12 people who were rushed to the hospital after the attack had died. Ryan Mielke, a hospital spokesman, said all of the victims suffered traumatic injuries. He declined to provide additional details about the victims. Mielke said two children, ages two and nine, were stabilized at the medical center before being transferred to the neighboring El Paso children\u2019s hospital. Del Sol Medical Center said it was treating 11 other patients. The Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who previously represented El Paso in Congress, said some responsibility fell at the feet of President Donald Trump, who has been criticised for his racist rhethoric and has been accused of fanning the flames of hatred. \u201cYes \u2026 he is a racist, and he stokes racism in this country \u2026 and it leads to violence,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, after leaving the campaign trail to return to his home town. Trump tweeted to \u201ccondemn today\u2019s hateful act\u201d calling it an \u201cact of cowardice\u201d. Fellow 2020 Democratic candidate and former San Antonio mayor, Juli\u00e1n Castro, said: \u201cMy heart is with the people of El Paso today as they cope with a devastating mass shooting \u2026 This attack is a tragic reminder of our government\u2019s failure to do its most basic duty: to protect American lives. We need gun reform now.\u201d The shooting in El Paso comes less than a week after a shooting at a garlic festival in Gilroy, California, left three people dead and 15 injured. Law enforcement authorities said a 19-year-old who had previously lived in town cut his way through a fence to get inside the festival, then opened fire with a military-style rifle. Two Walmart employees were killed in a shooting at a Walmart in Mississippi last week. Every day, 100 people are killed with firearms in the US, and hundreds more injured, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. Other Democratic presidential candidates expressed outrage on Saturday that mass shootings have becoming chillingly common nationwide and blamed the National Rifle Association and its congressional allies. \u201cIt\u2019s not just today, it has happened several times this week. It\u2019s happened here in Las Vegas where some lunatic killed 50 some odd people,\u201d the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said as he and 18 other White House hopefuls were in Nevada to address the nation\u2019s largest public employees union. \u201cAll over the world, people are looking at the United States and wondering what is going on? What is the mental health situation in America, where time after time, after time, after time, we\u2019re seeing indescribable horror.\u201d Agencies contributed to this report",

The time and costs will go up massively if it proceeds to open selection \u2013 that means new leaflets, a website, more phone banks.\u201d</p> <p>The frustration applies to MPs in both safe and marginal seats, but many also said they felt the party was losing ground attacking the Conservatives because MPs\u2019 headspace was elsewhere. \u201cI have almost 2,000 members who I could take to campaign elsewhere, but we are locked down in the constituency \u2013 during the most rightwing government of my lifetime,\u201d one MP said.</p> <p>Another in a hyper-marginal seat said they knew that any loss of a trigger ballot would be relentlessly used by a Tory opponent. \u201cIf I get triggered, then voters in my constituency are effectively being told that my own members may not have confidence in me \u2013 and all while an election is looming,\u201d the MP said.</p> <p>MPs said they were prepared to throw every effort for the next few months into holding their seats. \u201cI don\u2019t do things by halves, if I\u2019m triggered I will be knocking on the door of every single member,\u201d one MP said. \u201cThere is no way I would leave it up to chance.\u201d</p> <p>Within the party\u2019s HQ, there is a lack of sympathy for MPs, especially for those who have only recently begun to desperately engage with members. One source close to Labour\u2019s governing national executive committee said: \u201cThe MPs who will be in trouble are ones who have not engaged sufficiently with their members. Some unlucky ones might get triggered but then they should comfortably win their selections,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>\u201cMember engagement is very important, local councillors have to do it constantly, and it\u2019s something MPs should be doing all the time regardless.\u201d</p> <p>Momentum, the leftwing grassroots group that has passionately advocated the democratic importance of open selections, has launched a nationwide campaign to encourage members to begin deselection processes for Labour MPs, arguing it can open the door for more diverse, younger, working-class MPs.</p> <p>The grassroots group said it would support rank-and-file members across the country to begin the process of challenging their sitting MP under Labour\u2019s trigger ballot system.</p> <p>Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/07/momentum-laura-parker-hard-left-tactics-trots-plotters\">Laura Parker</a>, has argued the only chance Labour will have to defeat the Conservatives is with \u201ca new generation of young, BAME, working-class leaders who will take on the political establishment and provide a genuine alternative\u201d.</p> <p>However, the group\u2019s mass campaign on the issue has also sparked some member mix-ups. \u201cSome members are demanding them in seats where they don\u2019t even have Labour MPs and have to be reminded that first they need to help elect a Labour MP and then they can worry about deselecting them,\u201d one party source said.</p> <p>Should a number of MPs be deselected, party whips are said to be nervous about whether those disgruntled MPs would even stay in the party. A handful of MPs have said they would consider defecting to the Lib Dems or standing as independents.</p> <p>\u201cI might even be tempted to cause an early byelection and I think I could take a fair few members with me,\u201d one MP said. \u201cBut I would never jump before I was pushed \u2013 for now I have to try and win this.\u201d</p>",

Labour MPs have always been subject to a trigger ballot, but rule changes agreed in September last year make it easier for an open selection to take place. If an MP fails to get endorsements from at least two-thirds of the local member branches and two-thirds of local affiliates, such as trade unions, then a full eight- to 12-week selection process will take place \u2013 with candidates allowed to run against the sitting MP. MPs named by their colleagues as likely to be in significant difficulty include areas where leftwing membership is strong, such as London constituencies held by Vicky Foxcroft and Helen Hayes, seats in Merseyside held by Louise Ellman and Maria and Angela Eagle, as well as places with large numbers of new members, such as Thangam Debbonaire\u2019s seat in Bristol West and Peter Kyle\u2019s seat in Hove. \u201cThangam has a real problem, particularly given that it\u2019s a massive local party which is very difficult for her to get to know everyone in there,\u201d one MP said. Other local factors could make a difference. Sources pointed to Birmingham Hall Green, held by Roger Godsiff, the MP who has angered many members by defending parents\u2019 rights to take their children out of LGBT-inclusive lessons. Many MPs have been quietly getting organised. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has run private sessions on surviving the deselection process, with training offered to about 160 MPs who are part of his \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d Future Britain group, set up after the departure of seven Labour MPs in February. \u201cI do expect to be triggered so I\u2019ve been doing a huge amount of work to compensate,\u201d one Midlands MP said. \u201cI suspect I could win a selection battle, but it\u2019s money and time which could go on fighting to keep this a Labour seat when the Tories are targeting it hard.\u201d Many MPs said they had compiled detailed lists of members they believed could be counted on to back them. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good idea of the members I think can help me win, people I\u2019ve persuaded to stay in the party, members who I\u2019ve convinced to join, those who have contacted me about stopping antisemitism or campaigning on Brexit,\u201d one MP said. Another said they were spending time and money on \u201ccalls, text messages, emails, social events all over the constituency\u201d and said colleagues were fundraising to cover their costs. \u201cThis is only to try and avoid losing the trigger. The time and costs will go up massively if it proceeds to open selection \u2013 that means new leaflets, a website, more phone banks.\u201d The frustration applies to MPs in both safe and marginal seats, but many also said they felt the party was losing ground attacking the Conservatives because MPs\u2019 headspace was elsewhere. \u201cI have almost 2,000 members who I could take to campaign elsewhere, but we are locked down in the constituency \u2013 during the most rightwing government of my lifetime,\u201d one MP said. Another in a hyper-marginal seat said they knew that any loss of a trigger ballot would be relentlessly used by a Tory opponent. \u201cIf I get triggered, then voters in my constituency are effectively being told that my own members may not have confidence in me \u2013 and all while an election is looming,\u201d the MP said. MPs said they were prepared to throw every effort for the next few months into holding their seats. \u201cI don\u2019t do things by halves, if I\u2019m triggered I will be knocking on the door of every single member,\u201d one MP said. \u201cThere is no way I would leave it up to chance.\u201d Within the party\u2019s HQ, there is a lack of sympathy for MPs, especially for those who have only recently begun to desperately engage with members. One source close to Labour\u2019s governing national executive committee said: \u201cThe MPs who will be in trouble are ones who have not engaged sufficiently with their members. Some unlucky ones might get triggered but then they should comfortably win their selections,\u201d the source said. \u201cMember engagement is very important, local councillors have to do it constantly, and it\u2019s something MPs should be doing all the time regardless.\u201d Momentum, the leftwing grassroots group that has passionately advocated the democratic importance of open selections, has launched a nationwide campaign to encourage members to begin deselection processes for Labour MPs, arguing it can open the door for more diverse, younger, working-class MPs. The grassroots group said it would support rank-and-file members across the country to begin the process of challenging their sitting MP under Labour\u2019s trigger ballot system. Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, Laura Parker, has argued the only chance Labour will have to defeat the Conservatives is with \u201ca new generation of young, BAME, working-class leaders who will take on the political establishment and provide a genuine alternative\u201d. However, the group\u2019s mass campaign on the issue has also sparked some member mix-ups. \u201cSome members are demanding them in seats where they don\u2019t even have Labour MPs and have to be reminded that first they need to help elect a Labour MP and then they can worry about deselecting them,\u201d one party source said. Should a number of MPs be deselected, party whips are said to be nervous about whether those disgruntled MPs would even stay in the party. A handful of MPs have said they would consider defecting to the Lib Dems or standing as independents. \u201cI might even be tempted to cause an early byelection and I think I could take a fair few members with me,\u201d one MP said. \u201cBut I would never jump before I was pushed \u2013 for now I have to try and win this.\u201d",

In effect it is seeking planning permission for a large-floorplate office that could be occupied by anyone. \u201cThe council is not opposed to the expansion of Tileyard studios to provide more space for micro and small creative businesses.\u201d Students on the course say it has enabled them to enter all aspects of the music industry. Sophia Mina will release her latest single Ain\u2019t Got Time on 10 August, partly due to her participation on the training programme. \u201cThe course bridges the gap between artists and singers and the industry. If they had their own space they could make the courses longer, bring in more trainees, expand the range of areas of the music industry they could teach. The course isn\u2019t just about how to write melodies and lyrics. It includes things like modelling classes which help performers pose confidently on stage. They could do a whole lot more with their own base,\u201d Mina said. Charlie Raphael-Campbell, the lead singer of an indie band, said the course gave her \u00a3100 in recording credits that she and her group used to record songs. \u201cIt would be nice to bring stability to the course, to give the project its own home, because when you do it you go all over the place to get trained up on different aspects of music production,\u201d she said. Their battle is backed by Sigala, who wrote the 2015 number one hit Easy Love and kickstarted his musical career at Tileyard. The DJ, who has also written and produced for Paloma Faith and Ella Eyre, said: \u201cTileyard really believed in me when I was on benefits and struggling to break into the music industry \u2026 It is absolutely unbelievable that the council would want to block Tileyard\u2019s future, which will stop young people getting into the music industry.\u201d At The Vinyl Cafe, facing on to studios where Oasis\u2019s Noel Gallagher will be recording later this year, Wizdom stressed his programme was unique in training young people in every aspect of the music industry. \u201cThis course is not The X Factor! We show that there are no quick fixes into the music business. It\u2019s about skills plus attitude plus experience that we can offer. All we are looking for is a place where we can permanently anchor down,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Thunderstorms are threatening to bring more unwanted rainfall to a Derbyshire town where a damaged dam is thought to be at risk of collapse. Whaley Bridge remained eerily quiet on Sunday morning as residents anxiously waited, with forecasters predicting days of heavy rain. Meanwhile, those who were evacuated from their homes were told on Sunday they would no longer be able to return to collect vital items. More than 1,500 residents were initially told by emergency services they would be allowed to briefly return home on Sunday to collect any necessary items, pets and medication they had left behind. But the weather forecast forced police to reverse the decision amid heightened safety concerns over the damaged dam at Toddbrook reservoir. After a command team meeting on Sunday morning, Derbyshire police said its decision was taken due to emergency service workers prioritising the \u201cpreservation of life\u201d. The force added: \u201cWhile there was an urgent need over the past 24 hours to allow residents back into the area, our first duty is to protect the lives of the public and emergency services.\u201d Hazel Thompson, who grew up in the town, said residents were waiting to see what would happen with the weather. \u201cWe have been told that they have now stopped dropping the aggregate and they are just working hard to lower the water levels even more,\u201d Thompson said. She added: \u201cSome roads have now been completely closed off and if residents leave their homes they are no longer being allowed to go back in.\u201d Gavin Tomlinson, Derbyshire\u2019s deputy chief fire officer, said teams at Whaley Bridge had made good progress overnight. \u201cWe now know we have taken around 35% of the contents of reservoir out now and we are aiming to get it down about 25% where we think it is at a safe level,\u201d he said. \u201cSo throughout the night what we have done is concentrated our efforts on making sure all the pumps run to full capacity. \u201cThat means as the water level drops \u2013 the reservoir doesn\u2019t have straight sides, it comes in [with sloping sides] \u2013 so we have to keep relocating the pumps further and further in.\u201d Just over six miles away in the town of Marple, on the outskirts of Stockport, the army has been deployed amid fears the River Goyt could overflow. Water from the Toddbrook reservoir is being released into local waterways, which is leading to an increased risk of flooding in nearby areas. Greater Manchester police said there was the potential for the situation at the reservoir to affect Marple, but stressed there were no plans to evacuate the town and said advice was being given out as a precaution. The Canal and River Trust estimated on Saturday that 105,000 cubic metres (23m gallons) of water had been pumped out in 12 hours with water levels being reduced by 1.3 metres since Thursday, but the condition of the structure remained critical. An RAF Chinook helicopter put 400 tonnes of sandbags on the affected part of the dam on Friday and added a further 70 on Saturday. Daniel Greenhalgh, a regional director at the trust, which owns the reservoir and dam, said: \u201cWe are not out of the woods yet. The last estimate was that residents could be out of their homes for seven days yet.\u201d The trust has defended the maintenance and safety of the 188-year-old structure.

Despite treatment, the cancer metastasised to her bones, lungs and brain. In March it spread to her liver and, as the side-effects of chemotherapy were no longer manageable, she decided to stop all treatment.</p> <p>\u201cMum has always been been brave \u2013 a real \u2018feel the fear then do it anyway\u2019 mentality to life \u2013 it\u2019s the legacy she leaves with us,\u201d Nicole Robertson said. \u201cThat was the greatest part, knowing we did everything we could to make her happy in life and comfortable in death.\u201d</p> <p>The assisted dying process had taken 26 days to complete and went smoothly, the daughters said.</p> <p>Hicks said her mother had been \u201cready to go\u201d: \u201cHer body was failing her and she was in incredible pain. She\u2019d been in pain for a long time.</p> <p>\u201cPalliative care did their job as well as they could. But it had been a long battle. She was tired, the pain was intolerable and there was no quality of life left for her.</p> <p>\u201cWe were there with her; her favourite music was playing in the background and she was surrounded by love. She left this world with courage and grace, knowing how much she is loved.\u201d</p> <p>The sisters said their mother\u2019s death had reinforced their belief that anyone who was terminally ill and in intolerable pain deserved the choice of a voluntary assisted death. \u201cIt is the most compassionate, dignified and logical option for those suffering in the end stages of life,\u201d Nicole said.</p> <p>The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the first use of the state\u2019s Voluntary Assisted Dying Act was \u201can historic moment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Victorian parliament legalised voluntary assisted dying so that Victorians with an insufferable, terminal and incurable illness can have a genuine and compassionate choice at the end of their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cToday we honour her memory and her bravery and we offer our sincere condolences to those who loved her.\u201d</p> <p>The Voluntary Assisted Dying Act passed parliament in 2017 after a conscience vote supported by the premier, Daniel Andrews, and the majority of his cabinet.</p> <p>Patients are required to meet strict criteria to be eligible, including having a terminal illness with no more than six months left to live, or 12 months if the patient has a degenerative neurological condition.</p> <p>To be approved, patients must have two doctors sign off on their application and make three requests.</p> <p>Andrew Denton, the director of Go Gentle Australia, said Robertson\u2019s story demonstrated how well the law had been designed. \u201cThe eligibility criteria were met, the safeguards were worked through and Kerry Robertson and her family were offered the compassionate death Kerry wanted,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cImportantly, too, access to the process was not an issue, even though the family was from regional Victoria. It is a testament to the dedication and compassion of everyone involved.\u201d</p> <p>The government expects up to 150 people a year will use the scheme. Similar laws are being considered in Western Australia and Queensland.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A Victorian woman has become the first person to end her life under the state\u2019s new voluntary assisted dying laws. Kerry Robertson, 61, died at a nursing home in Bendigo on 15 July after almost a decade of living with cancer. Her daughters, Jacqui Hicks and Nicole Robertson, told the advocacy group Go Gentle Australia her death had been \u201cbeautiful and peaceful\u201d. \u201cIt was a beautiful, positive experience,\u201d the two women said. \u201cIt was the empowered death that she wanted.\u201d Robertson was the first person to be granted a permit to end her life under the law, having visited her specialist the day legislation came into effect on 19 June. Robertson was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. Despite treatment, the cancer metastasised to her bones, lungs and brain. In March it spread to her liver and, as the side-effects of chemotherapy were no longer manageable, she decided to stop all treatment. \u201cMum has always been been brave \u2013 a real \u2018feel the fear then do it anyway\u2019 mentality to life \u2013 it\u2019s the legacy she leaves with us,\u201d Nicole Robertson said. \u201cThat was the greatest part, knowing we did everything we could to make her happy in life and comfortable in death.\u201d The assisted dying process had taken 26 days to complete and went smoothly, the daughters said. Hicks said her mother had been \u201cready to go\u201d: \u201cHer body was failing her and she was in incredible pain. She\u2019d been in pain for a long time. \u201cPalliative care did their job as well as they could. But it had been a long battle. She was tired, the pain was intolerable and there was no quality of life left for her. \u201cWe were there with her; her favourite music was playing in the background and she was surrounded by love. She left this world with courage and grace, knowing how much she is loved.\u201d The sisters said their mother\u2019s death had reinforced their belief that anyone who was terminally ill and in intolerable pain deserved the choice of a voluntary assisted death. \u201cIt is the most compassionate, dignified and logical option for those suffering in the end stages of life,\u201d Nicole said. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the first use of the state\u2019s Voluntary Assisted Dying Act was \u201can historic moment\u201d. \u201cThe Victorian parliament legalised voluntary assisted dying so that Victorians with an insufferable, terminal and incurable illness can have a genuine and compassionate choice at the end of their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cToday we honour her memory and her bravery and we offer our sincere condolences to those who loved her.\u201d The Voluntary Assisted Dying Act passed parliament in 2017 after a conscience vote supported by the premier, Daniel Andrews, and the majority of his cabinet. Patients are required to meet strict criteria to be eligible, including having a terminal illness with no more than six months left to live, or 12 months if the patient has a degenerative neurological condition. To be approved, patients must have two doctors sign off on their application and make three requests. Andrew Denton, the director of Go Gentle Australia, said Robertson\u2019s story demonstrated how well the law had been designed. \u201cThe eligibility criteria were met, the safeguards were worked through and Kerry Robertson and her family were offered the compassionate death Kerry wanted,\u201d he said. \u201cImportantly, too, access to the process was not an issue, even though the family was from regional Victoria. It is a testament to the dedication and compassion of everyone involved.\u201d The government expects up to 150 people a year will use the scheme. Similar laws are being considered in Western Australia and Queensland.",

While plans have existed for generations and the US deployed a small nuclear reactor onboard a barge in the Panama Canal Zone in the 1960s and 70s, they have never been mass-produced. Rosatom, Russia\u2019s state nuclear energy company, hopes to change that and sell customised floating nuclear power stations to countries around the world. Rosatom said it has signed a project development agreement to explore the possibility of building a floating nuclear power plant for Sudan, among others.</p> <p>In Rosatom\u2019s business plan, the Akademik Lomonosov<em> </em>is part of the sales pitch. The platform, recently painted a brilliant white and stamped with the energy agency\u2019s logo, is an expensive pilot project with some extravagant flourishes, including a gym, pool and bar (with no alcohol) for crew members. Security is tight and visiting reporters were shadowed by private security guards while onboard.</p> <p>The Akademik Lomonosov, which took more than a decade to build, carries two KLT-40S nuclear reactors, similar to those used on Russia\u2019s nuclear icebreakers. The reactors use low-enriched uranium and are capable of producing a combined 70MW of electricity, which Rosatom estimates as enough for 100,000 homes. Rosatom also claims the platform is \u201cvirtually unsinkable\u201d and able to withstand collisions with icebergs and the impact of a seven-metre wave.</p> <p>Greenpeace has described the project as a \u201cnuclear Titanic\u201d and \u201cChernobyl on ice\u201d, at a time when popular attention to the threat of nuclear accidents has been stoked by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/07/chernobyl-review-chaos-reigns-in-confusing-nuclear-disaster-epic\">popular HBO mini</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/07/chernobyl-review-chaos-reigns-in-confusing-nuclear-disaster-epic\">series Chernobyl</a>, dramatising the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/16/chernobyl-was-even-worse-than-tv-series-kim-willsher\">nuclear disaster of 1986</a>. Neighbouring countries including Norway have successfully lobbied Rosatom not to load nuclear fuel on to the platform until after it is towed away from their borders.</p> <p>Rosatom officials visibly bristled at the comparisons to previous nuclear accidents, arguing Chernobyl used far larger reactors of a different type and the nuclear technology onboard the Akademik Lomonosov had already been employed on Russia\u2019s fleet of nuclear icebreakers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/16/chernobyl-was-even-worse-than-tv-series-kim-willsher\">The truth about Chernobyl?

There should always be scepticism [of new technology]. But they\u2019re going overboard. If they say there is a possibility of an accident with the reactor then they have to present evidence.\u201d</p> <p>In case of an accident and a reactor shutdown, Irminku said, the ice-cold water beneath the reactor could be used as coolant until help arrived.</p> <p>The Bellona Foundation, which covers environmental issues in the Arctic region, theorised in a 2011 report that waves from a tsunami could throw the nuclear power plant away from its water source on shore, leading to a \u201cnuclear accident with grave consequences\u201d.</p> <p>Rosatom says dangers from waves are mitigated by a dock constructed around the power station, and if thrown inland, the reactors\u2019 emergency systems can cool them without an electricity supply for 24 hours.</p> <p>Dmitry Alekseyenko, a deputy head of construction and operation of the platform, said: \u201cWe studied the experience of Fukushima closely. [What happens] if the platform is hit by a tsunami? Or thrown onshore? According to our tests, a tsunami caused by a nine-point [earthquake] will not dislocate it from its base.\u201d</p> <p>Anna Kireeva of Bellona said the organisation had closely followed the development of the Akademik Lomonosov. Russian experts may safely be able to operate a floating nuclear power plant, she said, but plans to license out the technology raised much larger concerns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed7b3715113ecd604a491dc34c68b57d90396869\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed7b3715113ecd604a491dc34c68b57d90396869/0_119_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Akademik Lomonosov is towed out of St Petersburg, Russia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Akademik Lomonosov is towed out of St Petersburg bound for Murmansk in April 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolai Gontar/Greenpeace/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur real concern is the reason why they\u2019re making this floating plant \u2013 they want to sell this technology to countries like Sudan,\u201d she said in a telephone interview.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really concerned that such nuclear technologies can be used in countries where levels of nuclear radiation safety, regulation and standards of safety are not on such a high level as in Russia. What will they do with spent nuclear fuel? How will they react in case of emergencies?\u201d</p> <p>The other question is whether floating power plants are economically viable. While Rosatom executives have touted interest in the platforms, potential buyers have yet to put any money on the table. Some critics have called the project frivolous.</p> <p>Nilsen described it as a \u201cPR project\u201d, citing the lack of additional orders and the ready availability of liquefied natural gas in the Arctic region as an alternative to nuclear power.</p> <p>\u201cIf this had been a very good way of providing electricity to the north coast of Siberia then we would have seen more of them under construction \u2026 I think this is going to be a one-of-a-kind project,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rosatom officials declined to say how much the Akademik Lomonosov<em> </em>cost, although they did say they expected prices to fall as further plants were built. In 2016, an official connected to the project said the floating nuclear power station cost an estimated 21.5bn roubles (\u00a3274m), and the necessary infrastructure would cost an additional 7bn roubles.</p> <p>After years of reported cost overruns and delays, Alekseyenko called the plant\u2019s completion a \u201cmilestone\u201d for Rosatom and Russia\u2019s shipbuilding industry. \u201cAn order this big hasn\u2019t been completed for a long time,\u201d he said.</p>",

Russia claims the project will provide clean energy to the remote region and allow authorities to retire an ageing nuclear plant and a coal-burning power station. But the Akademik Lomonosov has raised safety concerns among environmental groups, including accusations from Greenpeace that it could be a \u201cfloating Chernobyl\u201d, and doubts about whether floating nuclear power stations meant to provide power to remote regions are economically viable. The Northern Sea Route \u2013 shipping lanes opened by melting ice sheets in the Arctic \u2013 presents new trade routes between China and Europe that Russia hopes to make navigable year-round. The prospect of lucrative trade routes, as well as the region\u2019s military importance, has led to a proliferation of nuclear-powered icebreakers, submarines and other high-tech nuclear technologies in the Arctic region. Thomas Nilsen, the editor of the Barents Observer newspaper, based in the Norwegian town of Kirkenes, has estimated that by 2035, the Russian Arctic \u201cwill by far be the most nuclearised waters on the planet\u201d. Floating nuclear power stations may play a role. While plans have existed for generations and the US deployed a small nuclear reactor onboard a barge in the Panama Canal Zone in the 1960s and 70s, they have never been mass-produced. Rosatom, Russia\u2019s state nuclear energy company, hopes to change that and sell customised floating nuclear power stations to countries around the world. Rosatom said it has signed a project development agreement to explore the possibility of building a floating nuclear power plant for Sudan, among others. In Rosatom\u2019s business plan, the Akademik Lomonosov is part of the sales pitch. The platform, recently painted a brilliant white and stamped with the energy agency\u2019s logo, is an expensive pilot project with some extravagant flourishes, including a gym, pool and bar (with no alcohol) for crew members. Security is tight and visiting reporters were shadowed by private security guards while onboard. The Akademik Lomonosov, which took more than a decade to build, carries two KLT-40S nuclear reactors, similar to those used on Russia\u2019s nuclear icebreakers. The reactors use low-enriched uranium and are capable of producing a combined 70MW of electricity, which Rosatom estimates as enough for 100,000 homes. Rosatom also claims the platform is \u201cvirtually unsinkable\u201d and able to withstand collisions with icebergs and the impact of a seven-metre wave. Greenpeace has described the project as a \u201cnuclear Titanic\u201d and \u201cChernobyl on ice\u201d, at a time when popular attention to the threat of nuclear accidents has been stoked by the popular HBO miniseries Chernobyl, dramatising the nuclear disaster of 1986. Neighbouring countries including Norway have successfully lobbied Rosatom not to load nuclear fuel on to the platform until after it is towed away from their borders. Rosatom officials visibly bristled at the comparisons to previous nuclear accidents, arguing Chernobyl used far larger reactors of a different type and the nuclear technology onboard the Akademik Lomonosov had already been employed on Russia\u2019s fleet of nuclear icebreakers. Irminku said: \u201cThis and a \u2018Chernobyl on ice\u2019 is just night and day \u2013 we\u2019re talking about totally different systems. There should always be scepticism [of new technology]. But they\u2019re going overboard. If they say there is a possibility of an accident with the reactor then they have to present evidence.\u201d In case of an accident and a reactor shutdown, Irminku said, the ice-cold water beneath the reactor could be used as coolant until help arrived. The Bellona Foundation, which covers environmental issues in the Arctic region, theorised in a 2011 report that waves from a tsunami could throw the nuclear power plant away from its water source on shore, leading to a \u201cnuclear accident with grave consequences\u201d. Rosatom says dangers from waves are mitigated by a dock constructed around the power station, and if thrown inland, the reactors\u2019 emergency systems can cool them without an electricity supply for 24 hours. Dmitry Alekseyenko, a deputy head of construction and operation of the platform, said: \u201cWe studied the experience of Fukushima closely. [What happens] if the platform is hit by a tsunami? Or thrown onshore? According to our tests, a tsunami caused by a nine-point [earthquake] will not dislocate it from its base.\u201d Anna Kireeva of Bellona said the organisation had closely followed the development of the Akademik Lomonosov. Russian experts may safely be able to operate a floating nuclear power plant, she said, but plans to license out the technology raised much larger concerns. \u201cOur real concern is the reason why they\u2019re making this floating plant \u2013 they want to sell this technology to countries like Sudan,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cI\u2019m really concerned that such nuclear technologies can be used in countries where levels of nuclear radiation safety, regulation and standards of safety are not on such a high level as in Russia. What will they do with spent nuclear fuel? How will they react in case of emergencies?\u201d The other question is whether floating power plants are economically viable. While Rosatom executives have touted interest in the platforms, potential buyers have yet to put any money on the table. Some critics have called the project frivolous. Nilsen described it as a \u201cPR project\u201d, citing the lack of additional orders and the ready availability of liquefied natural gas in the Arctic region as an alternative to nuclear power. \u201cIf this had been a very good way of providing electricity to the north coast of Siberia then we would have seen more of them under construction \u2026 I think this is going to be a one-of-a-kind project,\u201d he said. Rosatom officials declined to say how much the Akademik Lomonosov cost, although they did say they expected prices to fall as further plants were built. In 2016, an official connected to the project said the floating nuclear power station cost an estimated 21.5bn roubles (\u00a3274m), and the necessary infrastructure would cost an additional 7bn roubles. After years of reported cost overruns and delays, Alekseyenko called the plant\u2019s completion a \u201cmilestone\u201d for Rosatom and Russia\u2019s shipbuilding industry. \u201cAn order this big hasn\u2019t been completed for a long time,\u201d he said.",

The Muslim ethnic group has been persecuted for generations, most recently from 2017, when 800,000 picked up whatever they could carry to flee to Bangladesh. But little has been written from the point of view of a Rohingya growing up in Myanmar \u2013 the daily humiliations, the struggle for survival, the fear, the stories whispered through generations to ensure they are not lost. Habiburahman, known as Habib, was born in a village in the west of the country around 1979 \u2013 he is not quite sure of the year. He has written his life story, and through that, the story of his people.</p> <p>We meet in his publishers\u2019 bland office in Melbourne, Australia. He is dressed in a neat blue shirt and dark trousers, and his black hair is slicked back. He laughs readily and his phone buzzes with messages.</p> <p>Habib arrived in Australia by boat in 2009 and, although he is a recognised refugee and has a temporary visa, his status remains unresolved. He is still stateless. He has no passport. \u201cI have nowhere to go,\u201d he says, with a laugh that has little humour in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a18a62ca854941b588d6ab569c23b991633f21db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a18a62ca854941b588d6ab569c23b991633f21db/218_172_3958_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Rohingyan refugee boy pleads for aid at the Balukali refugee camp in Bangladesh in 2017.

He explains that the book began with Ansel writing him questions, to which he would provide long answers about his life. It was first published in 2018 in French and is now being released in English.</p> <p>Habib says he wanted to write his story because \u201cmy generation, my grandfather, great-grandfather \u2013 we have been oppressed for a long time and this has never been reported. Our history is [becoming] lost. The land where we lived in the past is now replaced with government buildings, new projects; everything has gone. The new generation of Burmese, they don\u2019t know anything about Rohingya.\u201d He called the book First, They Erased Our Name.</p> <p>Habib\u2019s own life has been one of erasure and running. In 1982, when he was a small child, the military dictator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/06/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Ne Win</a> introduced a law that said that in order to be a citizen, you had to be a member of specific ethnic groups \u2013 but the more than one million Rohingya were not among them. From then on, Habib writes, \u201cthe word Rohingya is prohibited. It no longer exists. I am three years old and am effectively erased from existence.\u201d Burma became isolated and desperately poor. The Rohingya were declared to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. It was a \u201csecret identity\u201d talked about only at home. Clandestine language lessons were organised for children.</p> <p>The book is written in simple language and tells the story without embellishment. There is no need for flourishes; it is relentless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9ff47110d8654594506f930a1845cc5770409396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff47110d8654594506f930a1845cc5770409396/0_0_2238_2998/746.jpg\" alt=\"Myanmar\u2019s General Ne Win ...introduced a law denying the Rohingya citizenship.

He grew up in a world where Rohingya must get permission before leaving their village and official approval before marrying. Many are denied access to education or healthcare \u2013 Habib had to falsify documents to pretend he was not Rohingya in order to study at college. They are constantly harassed in a country where, he writes, \u201ctormenting the Rohingya has become a national sport\u201d.</p> <p>For Habib and his family, life outside the home meant keeping their heads down, trying not to be noticed. Members of the army trashed his father\u2019s small goods and herbal medicine shop, and dragged him and his wife off for questioning. His parents returned the next day, beaten and terrified.</p> <p>Bribery, in order to stay out of trouble, was routine. Villagers were required to offer up family members to work for nothing for the army. Then soldiers told the family their home was being requisitioned and would be destroyed to make way for military toilets. It became impossible to live in their village, so in the mid-1990s the family fled to Sittwe, deep in Rakhine state, the ancestral home of the Rohingya, where they face intense persecution.</p> <p>Habib tried to have a life. He dreamed of becoming a lawyer and became involved in a political group while studying in Yangon, secretly distributing pamphlets identifying the riches of Myanmar plundered by the military. The group was raided. Habib and others were tortured.<strong> </strong> He writes that he was held for days and beaten, his interrogators demanding to know whether his papers were fake, and he was really Rohingya. A teacher helped organise bribes for the guards and Habib escaped to Thailand, eventually ending up in Malaysia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7df7dfca2a818b24358d39020e9e83bbfbeecc2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7df7dfca2a818b24358d39020e9e83bbfbeecc2d/0_71_4134_2642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rohingya children at a displacement camp in Sittwe, in western Myanmar, 2016.

The country is not a signatory to the UN\u2019s refugee convention, and Habib and hundreds of thousands of others were illegal immigrants, tolerated because they were needed on worksites, but regularly rounded up and detained. Eventually he was put in contact with the UN\u2019s refugee agency, which identified him as a refugee. Life was exhausting and precarious, and he began to talk to the media about the harassment of refugees with nowhere to go. \u201cI am tired of being on edge, day after day, a ball of stress in my stomach,\u201d he writes, \u201cin a world where a single lapse of concentration could turn my life upside down \u2026 Because I am my mother\u2019s and my father\u2019s son and I miss my family. Because I am a man like any other.\u201d</p> <p>Habib ran again, ending up on a boat from Indonesia to Australia in 2009. He was safe, but his ordeal was not over. He spent 32 months in immigration detention centres around the country. Frustrated by delays, he and others staged a <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2011/06/24/a-letter-from-the-roof-of-darwins-northern-immigration-detention-centre/\" title=\"\">rooftop protest and hunger strike</a> in Darwin. He was convicted of damaging commonwealth property, a decision quashed on appeal. But in a country with harsh policies toward refugees who arrive by boat, that incident has meant he is still waiting for a permanent protection visa a decade after he arrived.</p> <p>He has little contact with his family. His mother, brother and sister live a precarious life on the Myanmar-China border. A sister lives in a Bangladesh refugee camp, and another is a refugee in Norway. One sister followed him to Australia.

      "bodyText": "\u201cA tyrant leant over my cradle and traced a destiny for me that will be hard to avoid: I will either be a fugitive or I won\u2019t exist at all.\u201d \u2013 From First, They Erased Our Name: A Rohingya Speaks, by Habiburahman. There has been much written about the Rohingya people of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. The Muslim ethnic group has been persecuted for generations, most recently from 2017, when 800,000 picked up whatever they could carry to flee to Bangladesh. But little has been written from the point of view of a Rohingya growing up in Myanmar \u2013 the daily humiliations, the struggle for survival, the fear, the stories whispered through generations to ensure they are not lost. Habiburahman, known as Habib, was born in a village in the west of the country around 1979 \u2013 he is not quite sure of the year. He has written his life story, and through that, the story of his people. We meet in his publishers\u2019 bland office in Melbourne, Australia. He is dressed in a neat blue shirt and dark trousers, and his black hair is slicked back. He laughs readily and his phone buzzes with messages. Habib arrived in Australia by boat in 2009 and, although he is a recognised refugee and has a temporary visa, his status remains unresolved. He is still stateless. He has no passport. \u201cI have nowhere to go,\u201d he says, with a laugh that has little humour in it. We speak in English and Habib wrote the book in English with the help of a French journalist, Sophie Ansel, who has reported extensively on the Rohingya. He explains that the book began with Ansel writing him questions, to which he would provide long answers about his life. It was first published in 2018 in French and is now being released in English. Habib says he wanted to write his story because \u201cmy generation, my grandfather, great-grandfather \u2013 we have been oppressed for a long time and this has never been reported. Our history is [becoming] lost. The land where we lived in the past is now replaced with government buildings, new projects; everything has gone. The new generation of Burmese, they don\u2019t know anything about Rohingya.\u201d He called the book First, They Erased Our Name. Habib\u2019s own life has been one of erasure and running. In 1982, when he was a small child, the military dictator Ne Win introduced a law that said that in order to be a citizen, you had to be a member of specific ethnic groups \u2013 but the more than one million Rohingya were not among them. From then on, Habib writes, \u201cthe word Rohingya is prohibited. It no longer exists. I am three years old and am effectively erased from existence.\u201d Burma became isolated and desperately poor. The Rohingya were declared to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. It was a \u201csecret identity\u201d talked about only at home. Clandestine language lessons were organised for children. The book is written in simple language and tells the story without embellishment. There is no need for flourishes; it is relentless. Habib was regularly called \u201ckalar\u201d, a derogatory term referring to dark skin. He grew up in a world where Rohingya must get permission before leaving their village and official approval before marrying. Many are denied access to education or healthcare \u2013 Habib had to falsify documents to pretend he was not Rohingya in order to study at college. They are constantly harassed in a country where, he writes, \u201ctormenting the Rohingya has become a national sport\u201d. For Habib and his family, life outside the home meant keeping their heads down, trying not to be noticed. Members of the army trashed his father\u2019s small goods and herbal medicine shop, and dragged him and his wife off for questioning. His parents returned the next day, beaten and terrified. Bribery, in order to stay out of trouble, was routine. Villagers were required to offer up family members to work for nothing for the army. Then soldiers told the family their home was being requisitioned and would be destroyed to make way for military toilets. It became impossible to live in their village, so in the mid-1990s the family fled to Sittwe, deep in Rakhine state, the ancestral home of the Rohingya, where they face intense persecution. Habib tried to have a life. He dreamed of becoming a lawyer and became involved in a political group while studying in Yangon, secretly distributing pamphlets identifying the riches of Myanmar plundered by the military. The group was raided. Habib and others were tortured. He writes that he was held for days and beaten, his interrogators demanding to know whether his papers were fake, and he was really Rohingya. A teacher helped organise bribes for the guards and Habib escaped to Thailand, eventually ending up in Malaysia. His nine years in Malaysia brought a new world of purgatory. The country is not a signatory to the UN\u2019s refugee convention, and Habib and hundreds of thousands of others were illegal immigrants, tolerated because they were needed on worksites, but regularly rounded up and detained. Eventually he was put in contact with the UN\u2019s refugee agency, which identified him as a refugee. Life was exhausting and precarious, and he began to talk to the media about the harassment of refugees with nowhere to go. \u201cI am tired of being on edge, day after day, a ball of stress in my stomach,\u201d he writes, \u201cin a world where a single lapse of concentration could turn my life upside down \u2026 Because I am my mother\u2019s and my father\u2019s son and I miss my family. Because I am a man like any other.\u201d Habib ran again, ending up on a boat from Indonesia to Australia in 2009. He was safe, but his ordeal was not over. He spent 32 months in immigration detention centres around the country. Frustrated by delays, he and others staged a rooftop protest and hunger strike in Darwin. He was convicted of damaging commonwealth property, a decision quashed on appeal. But in a country with harsh policies toward refugees who arrive by boat, that incident has meant he is still waiting for a permanent protection visa a decade after he arrived. He has little contact with his family. His mother, brother and sister live a precarious life on the Myanmar-China border. A sister lives in a Bangladesh refugee camp, and another is a refugee in Norway. One sister followed him to Australia. He says most of his family has rejected him for leaving Myanmar because, as the eldest son, he was unable to help them or send them money. He has received no counselling. \u201cCulturally, and I personally, we don\u2019t like digging up the old wound, scratching back the scar and talking about the past,\u201d he says. He manages a broad smile. \u201cWhenever I feel it is very hard, I used to take sleeping pills when I was in detention, but outside, instead of sleeping pills, I take beer.\u201d His daily life involves working for community organisations helping the around 3,000 Rohingya living in Australia, and earning his living in welding and construction. Once a supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader at one time considered the great democratic hope of Myanmar, he is disillusioned by her failure to recognise and prevent the persecution of the Rohingya. After decades held under house arrest, she became state counsellor in 2016, and has been criticised for refusing to accept that the powerful military has committed massacres or undertaken ethnic cleansing. After the 2017 military clampdown on the Rohingya, which saw the burning of villages and the killing of thousands of people, the UN described the attack as ethnic cleansing with \u201cgenocidal intent\u201d. Those who fled are reluctant to return without guarantees of safety and human rights. The estimated 400,000 Rohingya who remain in Myanmar are, according to a UN investigator, living in conditions akin to concentration camps and ghettos. \u201cShe\u2019s just really taken a step for majority representation,\u201d he says of Aung San Suu Kyi. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care about minorities. Not only that, she is defending the military. She is saying, \u2018this is not happening, what they [Rohingya] are saying is fake\u2019 and she is blocking the international community coming to Burma.\u201d He recognises international efforts and the work of NGOs, but says developed nations are reluctant to use their power. \u201cThe international community\u2019s power has to be backed by the UN, and UN power has to be backed by developed nations, and developed nations have their own interests as to where they will interfere and not interfere. This is why they are not finding solutions to solve the crisis of Rohingya.\u201d Habib thinks about these big issues all the time and is in contact with groups around the world. In Melbourne, his life is nomadic still. During the week, he works on projects in Geelong, a city to the south-west of Melbourne. On the weekends, he moves in with friends 35km away in Dandenong, where many migrants and refugees live and where local Rohingya organisations are based. We meet for the second time in a modest blond-brick house, its living room decorated by spectacular arrangements of paper flowers. Shy children arrive to say hello.

Some tour guides provide customers in their groups with paint to spray their own slogans. \u201cThe Lennon wall is local but it\u2019s a symptom of a broader problem concerning the whole centre of Prague,\u201d the mayor of Prague 1, Pavel \u010ci\u017einsk\u00fd, said. The move by the Prague 1 municipality, which is responsible for the Czech capital\u2019s historic tourist district, is ironic. It was the placing of surveillance cameras on the same spot by the then communist regime of Czechoslovakia in the 1970s to scrutinise the neighbouring French embassy that inspired critics to start daubing opposition slogans on the wall. It was nicknamed after John Lennon following his death in 1980. The council decided to act after a criminal complaint from the wall\u2019s owner, the Sovereign Order of Malta, a Christian charitable order based in an adjacent property. The order alleged that the once-sedate setting in the historic old town\u2019s Mal\u00e1 Strana district was being destroyed by crowds of frequently drunk international tourists. The Sovereign Order of Malta will first convert the wall into an open-air gallery, with international artists recruited to restore its original tradition honouring Lennon and V\u00e1clav Havel, the former dissident who led the 1989 Velvet Revolution that toppled communism. New rules will prohibit daily spraying of the wall by members of the public and instead permit it only on agreed days. It is part of a wider offensive to regulate a tourist trade often based on organised pub crawls that local officials fear is transforming the ambience of the ancient city while driving natives out. Prague had a problem with \u201ctoo many tourists visiting the same few places and iconic buildings, and is accompanied by some businessmen or companies operating in breach of the local laws and causing noise at night or disrespectful behaviour towards Prague\u201d, said \u010ci\u017einsk\u00fd. A council investigation of one \u201chistoric tour\u201d found that customers paying 600 Czech koruna (\u00a321.50) were allowed to consume unlimited amounts of beer before finishing at the Lennon wall, where they were given stencils and paint to spray slogans. They were also offered free pies in exchange for leaving five-star reviews on TripAdvisor, the investigation found. Residents and gallery owners in the area have complained that their properties are being damaged by spray paint and that the peace and quiet has been shattered by rowdy night-time behaviour. \u201cWe invested a lot of money and resources to makes this a place of peace and relaxation,\u201d said Marek Vaculcik, the owner of Artis\u00e8me, an art gallery based behind the wall. \u201cInstead, people have come and started to behave very badly, often drunk. They are leaving a lot of trash and spraying the trees. We don\u2019t even want to clean the trees because it damages them.\u201d The wall has long been one of Prague\u2019s leading cultural attractions, with its anti-communist origins recently inspiring imitations in Hong Kong during pro-democracy protests there. But its former spirit of peaceful protest has been violated by recent sprayings that have included a depiction of male genitalia, as well as abusive messages attacking Brexit, Donald Trump and the police \u2013 the latter shortly after officers swooped on an organised tour and imposed fines for the illegal public drinking of alcohol. The tour company paid the fines and offered customers a free repeat tour as \u201ccompensation\u201d. \u010ci\u017einsk\u00fd insisted that deploying cameras in the area was justified, adding that such surveillance was commonplace in central Prague. \u201cThe romanticism of the 1980s protests are one thing, [but] the local people are already fed up,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say that the use of cameras aiming at the Lennon wall will be some breakthrough \u2013 no. It is already normal.\u201d The decision follows a separate initiative by locals to combat another problem blamed on tourists \u2013 the supposedly romantic attaching of padlocks known as \u201clovelocks\u201d to bridges and street lamps nearby. About 700kg of metal has been removed with high-powered cutters in recent months, erasing a problem that officials called \u201ca plague\u201d and which they said inflicted structural damage.",

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019re John Robins, there\u2019s always something to be anxious about. In his new show, Hot Shame, it\u2019s dating, and damp. In its predecessor, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/15/john-robins-review-edinburgh-festival-sara-pascoe\">a relationship breakup</a>. Even when that show won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/26/edinburgh-fringe-comedy-award-shared-hannah-gadsby-john-robins\">the Edinburgh comedy award in 2017</a>, Robins had cause to fret, as his triumph was overshadowed by ex-girlfriend Sara Pascoe performing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/05/sara-pascoe-lads-lads-lads-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh\">her own set on the</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/05/sara-pascoe-lads-lads-lads-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh\"> subject</a>, and by co-winner Hannah Gadsby, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/19/hannah-gadsby-review-nanette\">whose show Nanette</a> became a global phenomenon.</p> <p>What Robins\u2019 fall-guy shtick mustn\u2019t obscure, though, is that he is a top dog at standup. Hot Shame is the title of a book he displays stage right, mordant readings from which punctuate the hour. Each story details a mortifying incident in our host\u2019s life \u2013 like the time he cancelled a gig because he was addicted to online golf, or when, aged 15, he mistook flirting for saying the word \u201cknickers\u201d over and over.</p> <p>The show\u2019s first half relates a grownup version of that experience, as Robins meets a woman in a New York bar. They discuss Time\u2019s Up and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jun/05/aziz-ansaris-show-addresses-metoo-and-reveals-his-flawed-humanity\">Aziz Ansari</a> \u2013 after which, Robins feels powerless to make any further moves. It\u2019s a lovely routine about an awkward \u201cmillennium man\u201d in the age of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a>, as Robins labours to demonstrate both his sympathy with the cause (\u201cI have veered on the cool side of honest\u201d) and his sexual confidence.</p> <p>It works because we know his highly strung character so well: Robins has only to pitch himself into the scenario and let appalling foot-in-mouth comedy take its course. His second set piece isn\u2019t quite as inevitable, but reaps even bigger laughs, as he buys a humidifier to help his \u201ccrispy towels\u201d dry. In a manner recalling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/12/comedy.edinburghfestival\">Rhod Gilbert\u2019s great routine about tog ratings</a>, he then embarks on a neurotic odyssey into online review sites and emasculating encounters with tradesmen, ending with Robins threatening in a text message to a rising damp consultant to kill himself.</p> <p>It is a masterclass in tempo, tone and character, as apoplexy ebbs to stunned disbelief, before terminating in Robins\u2019 wordless horror at how badly he\u2019s failed at home improvement. Another winning show from a man who can\u2019t stop losing for our entertainment.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/john-robins-hot-shame\">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 25 August. <a href=\"https://www.johnrobins.com/\">Then touring</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2019+tone/reviews\">Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re John Robins, there\u2019s always something to be anxious about. In his new show, Hot Shame, it\u2019s dating, and damp. In its predecessor, it was a relationship breakup. Even when that show won the Edinburgh comedy award in 2017, Robins had cause to fret, as his triumph was overshadowed by ex-girlfriend Sara Pascoe performing her own set on the subject, and by co-winner Hannah Gadsby, whose show Nanette became a global phenomenon. What Robins\u2019 fall-guy shtick mustn\u2019t obscure, though, is that he is a top dog at standup. Hot Shame is the title of a book he displays stage right, mordant readings from which punctuate the hour. Each story details a mortifying incident in our host\u2019s life \u2013 like the time he cancelled a gig because he was addicted to online golf, or when, aged 15, he mistook flirting for saying the word \u201cknickers\u201d over and over. The show\u2019s first half relates a grownup version of that experience, as Robins meets a woman in a New York bar. They discuss Time\u2019s Up and Aziz Ansari \u2013 after which, Robins feels powerless to make any further moves. It\u2019s a lovely routine about an awkward \u201cmillennium man\u201d in the age of #MeToo, as Robins labours to demonstrate both his sympathy with the cause (\u201cI have veered on the cool side of honest\u201d) and his sexual confidence. It works because we know his highly strung character so well: Robins has only to pitch himself into the scenario and let appalling foot-in-mouth comedy take its course. His second set piece isn\u2019t quite as inevitable, but reaps even bigger laughs, as he buys a humidifier to help his \u201ccrispy towels\u201d dry. In a manner recalling Rhod Gilbert\u2019s great routine about tog ratings, he then embarks on a neurotic odyssey into online review sites and emasculating encounters with tradesmen, ending with Robins threatening in a text message to a rising damp consultant to kill himself. It is a masterclass in tempo, tone and character, as apoplexy ebbs to stunned disbelief, before terminating in Robins\u2019 wordless horror at how badly he\u2019s failed at home improvement. Another winning show from a man who can\u2019t stop losing for our entertainment. \u2022 At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August. Then touring. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews",

She was six at the time. \u201cI remember I was in one school programme where I finished all my history course material a month early,\u201d she says. \u201cSo Mama got me a supplementary curriculum and started back with Mesopotamian history.

They encouraged autonomous learning. \u201cThat is why, I think, I\u2019ve always loved learning.

She has been conducting interviews all day, and now her head is bowed a little. Her mother and her publicist sit off to the side, checking their phones, benevolently ignoring our conversation, except when Shahidi looks to her mother to confirm a fact or ask an opinion. Shahidi is sick \u2013 \u201cAllergies,\u201d she croaks apologetically \u2013 but within moments of a coughing fit she\u2019s turned back to face me, no trace of discomfort on her face, spine straight, eyes sparkling, articulate, elegant responses flowing like she was born to do this \u2013 which in a way she was.</p> <p>Shahidi is 19 and has been in entertainment for as long as she can remember. Her tight-knit family are all show-business-adjacent in some way or another. Her mother, Keri Salter Shahidi, was a commercial model. Her father, Iranian-American Afshin Shahidi is a photographer (one of his primary subjects was Prince).

I walked out and said, like, \u2018I honestly don\u2019t even need to book this,\u2019 the audition was just a really good time.\u201d <em>Black-ish</em> turned out to be a commercial and critical hit, a broad and big-hearted family show that also addressed complex issues about race and class in America. Shahidi\u2019s Zoey, blas\u00e9 and deadpan, pretty and popular, made a perfect foil to the show\u2019s more serious themes.</p> <p>In 2017, she starred in a spin-off show, <em>Grown-ish</em>, which charted Zoey\u2019s transition to college life and gave Shahidi the room to tell new stories about black women in America. It was a transition she describes as \u201cso much fun\u201d, one that allowed her to grow \u201cin terms of being able to tell it from a young woman\u2019s perspective \u2013 a young woman of colour.\u201d</p> <p>Shahidi is pleasant and engaging for all of our conversation, if a little modulated in the way you might expect of someone who has probably had a publicist for more of her life than she hasn\u2019t.</p> <p>But she visibly comes to life when discussion of her work segues into the political. She has become as well regarded for her activism as her acting, attracting awestruck plaudits from Oprah \u2013 who says she is hoping she lives long enough to see Shahidi become president \u2013 and sitting on panels about the future of feminism with Michelle Obama.</p> <p><em><strong>An organisation she </strong></em>co-founded, <a href=\"https://www.eighteenx18.com/\" title=\"\">Eighteen x 18</a>, is apolitical \u2013 it encourages youth-voter engagement in general and is not party-specific \u2013 but Shahidi\u2019s own views are unapologetically leftist. She donated to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/colin-kaepernick\" title=\"\">Colin </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/colin-kaepernick\" title=\"\">Kaepernick\u2019s</a> fund. She is a vocal supporter of <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a>. She takes the time, unlike many tokenistic liberals, to cite and highlight the work of those marginalised communities she learns from. She has appeared on panels promoting prison abolition. She was also one of the people who came out to support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/29/jussie-smollett-saga-chicago-criminal-justice-system\" title=\"\">Jussie Smollett</a>, the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/23/jussie-smollett-brothers-sue-attorney-staged-hate-latest\" title=\"\">Empire</a></em> actor who alleged he was beaten in a homophobic and racist attack, though she may well regret having done so now that he is thought to have faked the attack in a bizarre publicity stunt. Even if being vaguely progressive is now the celebrity norm, by Hollywood standards Shahidi is practically a radical.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dfc531b657c241f3e323d1b0bb2d2ad582fed37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dfc531b657c241f3e323d1b0bb2d2ad582fed37/0_10_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twin stars: Yara Shahidi with Charles Melton in The Sun Is Also a Star.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twin stars: Yara Shahidi with Charles Melton in The Sun Is Also a Star.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t so long ago that celebrities who wore their politics proudly, who tried to incorporate them into their entertainment career, were near-universally dismissed as mortifying. Even when they were doing something unimpeachable \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/07/wyclef-jean-sean-penn\" title=\"\"> Sean Penn providing water aid to Haiti</a>, say \u2013 there still seemed something, well, icky about it. At the Oscars in 2003, the documentarian Michael Moore was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/25/oscars2003.film\" title=\"\">booed</a> with alarming vitriol when he accepted his award with a speech criticising the Republican presidency. Nowadays, to not criticise Trump at least indirectly is starting to look remiss.</p> <p>There are, of course, plenty of celebrities whose political engagement is still bone-chillingly embarrassing. But there is also a generation of entertainers who seem to have no relationship to that clunky public announcement-style politics of old. People such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amandla-stenberg\" title=\"\">Amandla Stenberg</a>, the non-binary actor who starred in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/08/the-hate-u-give-review-amandla-sternberg-shines-in-tough-teen-movie-with-radical-bent\" title=\"\">The Hate U Give</a></em>.

They feel a million miles away from Leo DiCaprio, famous for dating young women and vlogging lectures about climate change from his private island.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Political conversations were already happening in my home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Shahidi\u2019s Iranian-American family home, she explains, always instilled these kind of humanitarian, community-minded values, so it didn\u2019t come as a shock to her when she was being asked about politics in the international press as a young teenager. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though I wasn\u2019t political before I was on my first panel,\u201d she says. \u201cThese conversations were already happening in my home.\u201d About fame she says, \u201cThe thing I\u2019ve appreciated the most is, in any other context, a 13-year-old would not have been asked about the political state of America, and been taken seriously.\u201d</p> <p>For someone like Shahidi, it would be much easier to be intentionally bland, popping up the odd <a href=\"https://tenor.com/search/happy-pride-gifs\" title=\"\">Happy Pride</a> tweet and celebrating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2016/apr/11/how-blackgirlmagic-became-a-rallying-cry-for-women-of-colour\" title=\"\">#BlackGirlMagic</a> every now and again. In a broader sense, there is something powerful about black entertainers refusing to be content with simply cashing a cheque and implicitly accepting a racist system that pays them but punishes their peers. They are refusing the expectation that if you are a beautiful woman, you should just stay quiet and smile; if you are a black entertainer, you should be grateful just to be let into the room. And they are aware of the long history of their predecessors who made similar refusals and were harshly punished for it.</p> <p>\u201cI come from a lineage of entertainers who put their careers on the line to speak about politics,\u201d Shahidi says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the only reason I can have this space. I wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/harry-belafonte\" title=\"\">Harry Belafontes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/26/eartha-kitt-obituary\" title=\"\">Eartha Kitts</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sidney-poitier\" title=\"\">Sidney Poitiers</a> and many others who jeopardised their careers and combined their art with their activism. I feel an immense privilege to be able to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>She was politicised, she says, when she began reading Baldwin and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/19/zora-neale-hurston-study-of-last-survivor-of-us-slave-trade-to-be-published\" title=\"\">Zora </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/19/zora-neale-hurston-study-of-last-survivor-of-us-slave-trade-to-be-published\" title=\"\">Neale Hurston</a> while a student in her Catholic high school, two writers who became the guiding lights of her self-education. Then she became, in the nicest of ways, a huge nerd. When I ask what young adult fiction she read when she was younger she has to eventually concede that she was too busy reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/kurtvonnegut\" title=\"\">Vonnegut</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/aldoushuxley\" title=\"\">Huxley</a>. I ask what her habits are, and she tells me that she isn\u2019t great at taking care of herself.</p> <p>Her mother pipes up immediately. \u201cYou\u2019ll call to tell me about a book while you should be sleeping! You will sacrifice food and sleep to read a book on anything in the socio-political realm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I called you then I was laughing so hard,\u201d Shahidi replies, \u201cbecause I caught myself making such loud verbal noises when something I was reading hit home. I was sitting there shouting: \u2018Oh, yes. Oh!\u2019 by myself.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout our conversation, Shahidi glances towards her mother, catching her eye when she says something self-deprecating, trying (successfully) to make her smile. Shahidi describes her mother as her best friend.</p> <p>She tells me she loves listening to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/?t=1564050905764\" title=\"\">NPR</a> podcasts, because they \u201ccontextualise very large existential questions\u201d. When do you listen to those, I ask. While you\u2019re exercising? She laughs \u2013 really laughs, for the first time \u2013 and looks back towards her mother who is shaking her head with wry disapproval.</p> <p>\u201cNo. My goal is that next time you talk to me, that is what I do while I\u2019m listening to a podcast, sweating. Because I don\u2019t do any right now.\u201d</p> <p>Pictures on her Instagram of her getting her makeup done while trying to devour more theory back up the impression of a woman devoted to knowledge, as, more to the point, does her 2018 admission to Harvard. Michelle Obama wrote her letter of recommendation. Harvard is the one subject a publicist asked me not to bring up during our conversation. Hollywood is one thing, but you can understand why she doesn\u2019t want fellow students at America\u2019s most prestigious university giving her side-eye for special treatment, no matter how genuinely earned her entrance was.</p> <p><em><strong>I ask how it feels </strong></em>when she is described as the voice of a generation, as she regularly is in profiles. \u201cI read that and think it\u2019s physically not possible,\u201d she responds, looking away. \u201cI am beyond proud of being a part of a generation that no one person could be the face of. I\u2019m grateful to be one of many voices.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am beyond proud of being a part of a generation that no one person could be the face of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What does she think about the politics of her new film, which deals with immigration so intimately within its romance narrative? \u201cThere\u2019s no trivialising of the deportation. There\u2019s a deep humanising of that experience, and I think the love story helps with that humanising. Being from a family defined by immigration myself, even though I can\u2019t claim the particulars of Natasha\u2019s story, I did my best to portray the gravity that I know is real \u2013 not only because of my own family story, but because of the stories of my friends.\u201d</p> <p>She talks a little about the movie and how important it was to her that her character didn\u2019t change herself for love. \u201cThe most disheartening movie I\u2019ve ever seen was <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/grease\" title=\"\">Grease</a></em>,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbecause I had always seen that one scene where she was in the latex body suit and assumed it was the middle of the movie. You know? And that she got to be herself eventually. Then I watched the whole thing and was like, really? She gets a makeover and comes out smoking and gets the guy and that\u2019s where it ends?\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s proud of pursuing her interests and not allowing acting to overtake them, so what has she got still on her list? Is there anything she hasn\u2019t turned her hand to yet? Writing, it seems to me, would be a natural diversion for someone as curious as her, and she confirms that she\u2019s got a laptop full of poetry which has been temporarily stalled because of water damage. She\u2019s cultivating an interest in music production, and says she\u2019s never happier than when listening to a song. She\u2019s inspired by her musician friends who are \u201ckilling the game\u201d and wants to know how exactly they do it.</p> <p>But at the moment, she\u2019s exactly where she wants to be. Her perfect day is one at the beach with her family, and music, and a Korean barbecue at the end.</p> <p>\u201cI think we as a family walked into this career knowing that Hollywood is just a place. It\u2019s not going anywhere. My parents have always said that acting is something we do, but not who we are.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Sun Is Also a Star is in cinemas nationwide from 9 August</em></p>",

Both her younger brothers model and act. Shahidi\u2019s big break came in 2013, when she was cast as Zoey, the teenage daughter of the Johnson family, in the ABC sitcom Black-ish. \u201cI was 13 when I auditioned,\u201d she says, \u201cand I remember having, like, the best time during that audition. I walked out and said, like, \u2018I honestly don\u2019t even need to book this,\u2019 the audition was just a really good time.\u201d Black-ish turned out to be a commercial and critical hit, a broad and big-hearted family show that also addressed complex issues about race and class in America. Shahidi\u2019s Zoey, blas\u00e9 and deadpan, pretty and popular, made a perfect foil to the show\u2019s more serious themes. In 2017, she starred in a spin-off show, Grown-ish, which charted Zoey\u2019s transition to college life and gave Shahidi the room to tell new stories about black women in America. It was a transition she describes as \u201cso much fun\u201d, one that allowed her to grow \u201cin terms of being able to tell it from a young woman\u2019s perspective \u2013 a young woman of colour.\u201d Shahidi is pleasant and engaging for all of our conversation, if a little modulated in the way you might expect of someone who has probably had a publicist for more of her life than she hasn\u2019t. But she visibly comes to life when discussion of her work segues into the political. She has become as well regarded for her activism as her acting, attracting awestruck plaudits from Oprah \u2013 who says she is hoping she lives long enough to see Shahidi become president \u2013 and sitting on panels about the future of feminism with Michelle Obama. An organisation she co-founded, Eighteen x 18, is apolitical \u2013 it encourages youth-voter engagement in general and is not party-specific \u2013 but Shahidi\u2019s own views are unapologetically leftist. She donated to Colin Kaepernick\u2019s fund. She is a vocal supporter of Black Lives Matter. She takes the time, unlike many tokenistic liberals, to cite and highlight the work of those marginalised communities she learns from. She has appeared on panels promoting prison abolition. She was also one of the people who came out to support Jussie Smollett, the Empire actor who alleged he was beaten in a homophobic and racist attack, though she may well regret having done so now that he is thought to have faked the attack in a bizarre publicity stunt. Even if being vaguely progressive is now the celebrity norm, by Hollywood standards Shahidi is practically a radical. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that celebrities who wore their politics proudly, who tried to incorporate them into their entertainment career, were near-universally dismissed as mortifying. Even when they were doing something unimpeachable \u2013 Sean Penn providing water aid to Haiti, say \u2013 there still seemed something, well, icky about it. At the Oscars in 2003, the documentarian Michael Moore was booed with alarming vitriol when he accepted his award with a speech criticising the Republican presidency. Nowadays, to not criticise Trump at least indirectly is starting to look remiss. There are, of course, plenty of celebrities whose political engagement is still bone-chillingly embarrassing. But there is also a generation of entertainers who seem to have no relationship to that clunky public announcement-style politics of old. People such as Amandla Stenberg, the non-binary actor who starred in The Hate U Give. Or Donald Glover, or Willow Smith, or Indya Moore, the transgender star of Pose, whose values don\u2019t seem separate from what they do or say in their careers and personal lives. They feel a million miles away from Leo DiCaprio, famous for dating young women and vlogging lectures about climate change from his private island. Shahidi\u2019s Iranian-American family home, she explains, always instilled these kind of humanitarian, community-minded values, so it didn\u2019t come as a shock to her when she was being asked about politics in the international press as a young teenager. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though I wasn\u2019t political before I was on my first panel,\u201d she says. \u201cThese conversations were already happening in my home.\u201d About fame she says, \u201cThe thing I\u2019ve appreciated the most is, in any other context, a 13-year-old would not have been asked about the political state of America, and been taken seriously.\u201d For someone like Shahidi, it would be much easier to be intentionally bland, popping up the odd Happy Pride tweet and celebrating #BlackGirlMagic every now and again. In a broader sense, there is something powerful about black entertainers refusing to be content with simply cashing a cheque and implicitly accepting a racist system that pays them but punishes their peers. They are refusing the expectation that if you are a beautiful woman, you should just stay quiet and smile; if you are a black entertainer, you should be grateful just to be let into the room. And they are aware of the long history of their predecessors who made similar refusals and were harshly punished for it. \u201cI come from a lineage of entertainers who put their careers on the line to speak about politics,\u201d Shahidi says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the only reason I can have this space. I wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for the Harry Belafontes and Eartha Kitts, the Sidney Poitiers and many others who jeopardised their careers and combined their art with their activism. I feel an immense privilege to be able to do the same.\u201d She was politicised, she says, when she began reading Baldwin and Zora Neale Hurston while a student in her Catholic high school, two writers who became the guiding lights of her self-education. Then she became, in the nicest of ways, a huge nerd. When I ask what young adult fiction she read when she was younger she has to eventually concede that she was too busy reading Vonnegut and Huxley. I ask what her habits are, and she tells me that she isn\u2019t great at taking care of herself. Her mother pipes up immediately. \u201cYou\u2019ll call to tell me about a book while you should be sleeping! You will sacrifice food and sleep to read a book on anything in the socio-political realm.\u201d \u201cWhen I called you then I was laughing so hard,\u201d Shahidi replies, \u201cbecause I caught myself making such loud verbal noises when something I was reading hit home. I was sitting there shouting: \u2018Oh, yes. Oh!\u2019 by myself.\u201d Throughout our conversation, Shahidi glances towards her mother, catching her eye when she says something self-deprecating, trying (successfully) to make her smile. Shahidi describes her mother as her best friend. She tells me she loves listening to NPR podcasts, because they \u201ccontextualise very large existential questions\u201d. When do you listen to those, I ask. While you\u2019re exercising? She laughs \u2013 really laughs, for the first time \u2013 and looks back towards her mother who is shaking her head with wry disapproval. \u201cNo. My goal is that next time you talk to me, that is what I do while I\u2019m listening to a podcast, sweating. Because I don\u2019t do any right now.\u201d Pictures on her Instagram of her getting her makeup done while trying to devour more theory back up the impression of a woman devoted to knowledge, as, more to the point, does her 2018 admission to Harvard. Michelle Obama wrote her letter of recommendation. Harvard is the one subject a publicist asked me not to bring up during our conversation. Hollywood is one thing, but you can understand why she doesn\u2019t want fellow students at America\u2019s most prestigious university giving her side-eye for special treatment, no matter how genuinely earned her entrance was. I ask how it feels when she is described as the voice of a generation, as she regularly is in profiles. \u201cI read that and think it\u2019s physically not possible,\u201d she responds, looking away. \u201cI am beyond proud of being a part of a generation that no one person could be the face of. I\u2019m grateful to be one of many voices.\u201d What does she think about the politics of her new film, which deals with immigration so intimately within its romance narrative? \u201cThere\u2019s no trivialising of the deportation. There\u2019s a deep humanising of that experience, and I think the love story helps with that humanising. Being from a family defined by immigration myself, even though I can\u2019t claim the particulars of Natasha\u2019s story, I did my best to portray the gravity that I know is real \u2013 not only because of my own family story, but because of the stories of my friends.\u201d She talks a little about the movie and how important it was to her that her character didn\u2019t change herself for love. \u201cThe most disheartening movie I\u2019ve ever seen was Grease,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbecause I had always seen that one scene where she was in the latex body suit and assumed it was the middle of the movie. You know? And that she got to be herself eventually. Then I watched the whole thing and was like, really? She gets a makeover and comes out smoking and gets the guy and that\u2019s where it ends?\u201d She\u2019s proud of pursuing her interests and not allowing acting to overtake them, so what has she got still on her list? Is there anything she hasn\u2019t turned her hand to yet? Writing, it seems to me, would be a natural diversion for someone as curious as her, and she confirms that she\u2019s got a laptop full of poetry which has been temporarily stalled because of water damage. She\u2019s cultivating an interest in music production, and says she\u2019s never happier than when listening to a song. She\u2019s inspired by her musician friends who are \u201ckilling the game\u201d and wants to know how exactly they do it. But at the moment, she\u2019s exactly where she wants to be. Her perfect day is one at the beach with her family, and music, and a Korean barbecue at the end. \u201cI think we as a family walked into this career knowing that Hollywood is just a place. It\u2019s not going anywhere. My parents have always said that acting is something we do, but not who we are.\u201d The Sun Is Also a Star is in cinemas nationwide from 9 August",

      "bodyText": "Two cars are hurtling towards each other down a narrow country lane. Both have the option to pull over but neither driver wants to give way first. What happens next? This is the sort of scenario that lies at the heart of game theory, the use of models to show how rational decision-makers interact with each other. Game theory is big in economics and, in the current circumstances, that\u2019s hardly surprising because two key political issues lend themselves to game theory analysis. The first is the US-China trade war, with the two cars heading towards each other down the country road being driven by Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. The vehicles have already ignored plenty of passing places along the way and a head-on crash is a distinct possibility. Both drivers are aware of the risks but neither wants to lose face in the game of chicken. Trump has made getting concessions out of China a totemic issue for his political base; Xi is another self-styled strongman already facing an internal threat to his authority from the protests in Hong Kong. Last week, trade talks between officials from Washington and Beijing were held in Shanghai. This was seen as a hopeful sign \u2013 an indication that the leaders of the world\u2019s two biggest economies were fully aware of the dangers of protectionism. But Trump\u2019s way of playing the game is to keep his opponent guessing. So he chose this moment to announce something unexpected: plans for a 10% tariff on $300bn of Chinese imports into the US, which \u2013 if actually implemented on 1 September \u2013 will mean virtually nothing China sells to the US will be exempt from duties. Trump says he wants a deal with Xi and that is true. But he wants a deal that involves Xi slipping into the passing place while he zooms past. His strategy for getting what he wants involves putting his foot on the accelerator rather than on the brake. The White House is assuming that this is a rerun of the Cuban missile crisis \u2013 another classic example of game theory \u2013 in which John F Kennedy\u2019s threat to push the nuclear button forced Nikita Khrushchev to back down. Xi, meanwhile, has continued to trundle down the road at a steady pace. He thinks Trump will be wary of spooking the stock market and of making American consumers pay more for their smartphones and laptops. After four decades of rapid economic growth, Beijing reckons it is in a much stronger position today than the Soviet Union was in October 1962. In the real world, head-on collisions happen relatively rarely. More often, both drivers slam on their brakes at the last minute and after waving their fists at each other grudgingly work out a way to pass. But accidents do happen. And when they do they cause lots of damage. The \u201cgame\u201d between the US and China has been between two well-matched opponents. Up until now, the \u201cgame\u201d between the UK and the EU over Brexit has been much more one-sided. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, operated from the outset on the assumption that for all her tough talk, Theresa May would always be the first to blink. And in the negotiations that culminated in the draft withdrawal agreement last autumn, he was proved absolutely right. The dynamics of the game, though, have changed since the start of the year when it first became clear that the inclusion of the Northern Ireland backstop in the withdrawal agreement meant May could not get her deal through parliament. May\u2019s failure to actualise the result of the referendum led to the rise of the Brexit party, which came first in the elections for the European parliament. Conservatives \u2013 aware that the party is facing an existential crisis \u2013 dumped May and replaced her with someone they thought could see off the threat posed by Nigel Farage. Boris Johnson has arrived in Downing Street and has reshaped the cabinet so that it is run by Brexit true believers rather than those who backed remain in the referendum.

      "bodyText": "Millions of homes in the UK could be in line for a reduction of \u00a380 on their energy bills this winter under plans from the industry regulator to lower the energy price cap. This week, Ofgem is widely expected to announce a lower cap on energy bills for 11m homes using standard variable energy tariffs, which could cut the average annual bill by 6%. The regulator\u2019s tighter cap on energy bills would take effect from October and remain in place through the winter months, to bring bills in line with lower gas market prices. However, energy companies have warned the welcome news for households could be a death blow for smaller energy startups. Eleven small energy companies have gone bust in recent years, many of which offered unsustainably low energy deals in order to lure customers away from incumbent players. The lower price threshold for energy deals could put extra pressure on the small challengers ahead of the annual deadline for energy company payments. In the past, failed energy upstarts have left a total of \u00a3170m-worth of renewable energy subsidies unpaid, after collecting them through energy bills, which the regulator clawed back through extra charges for established energy companies. Energy bosses are understood to be frustrated because they feel forced to bail out the companies that are reducing their market share. Ofgem has recently raised the financial requirements for companies to be granted an energy supply licence to crack down on the number of unsustainable suppliers competing to supply an essential home service. But British Gas and SSE, the two largest suppliers in the market, are also calling for the energy price cap to be scrapped. The cap was brought in by the Conservative government after the Labour party made freezing rising energy bills one of its 2015 election pledges, to protect consumers against \u201crip-off\u201d energy tariffs. Iain Conn, the outgoing boss of British Gas\u2019s parent company, Centrica, said Boris Johnson\u2019s government should consider scrapping the cap. SSE has said it plans to use a new government consultation on the energy market to call for an overhaul of the energy price cap. It said Ofgem should continue to intervene in the market to protect vulnerable energy customers who may find it difficult to shop around for a better deal. Otherwise, the regulator should abandon a mandatory cap on energy deals in favour of a benchmark guide price. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow business and energy secretary, said there was a danger that Johnson would \u201chike up energy bills for millions of people\u201d by scrapping the cap. \u201cThe next Labour government will retain and strengthen the energy price cap to keep bills down for the British people, bring the grid into public ownership to end the rip-off and launch a green industrial revolution to create jobs and cleaner energy,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Every aspect of the pineapple lily <em>Eucomis sp </em>is just so unbelievably exotic. They hail from sunny southern Africa, throw up dazzling, jungly blooms that look like something straight out of a kid\u2019s story book and some can produce massive rosettes of leaves that tower over you. Yet if you have a sunny spot with well-drained soil, they are some of the easiest and most affordable garden plants to grow, even on our chilly North Atlantic islands.</p> <p>Like something from the understorey of a <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/henri-rousseau-surprised\" title=\"\">Rousseau painting</a> that has come to life, <em>Eucomis bicolor</em> creates big, fat flower spikes about 30cm high, consisting of dozens of cream and lime green star-shaped blooms, each petal of which is delicately painted bright burgundy. Wide, strappy leaves are matched with a top-knot of leafy growth above the flower spike, making the whole plant look like a florist\u2019s recreation of a pineapple.</p> <p>This species is generally said to withstand temperatures as low as -10C, making it one of the hardiest of all eucomis, but when well mulched I have seen it take lows of -15C during really cold winters. All you have to do is spread a layer of leaf mould or bark about 10cm thick over the soil surface in autumn, which creates an insulating blanket to keep the worst of the frost from getting at the dormant bulb beneath.</p> <p>To give you an indication of how resilient this plant is, I had some in a wide, shallow patio pot at the bottom of my garden that kept coming back in full flower for six years without any care whatsoever. No watering, no fertiliser, nothing. I was so surprised when I noticed how well it was doing despite total neglect, I decided to leave it to see how long this could continue. (Terrible plant parent, I know.) To my surprise, it only gave up the ghost when the level of compost in the pot eventually degraded to the point at which it exposed the bulb. I can\u2019t think of any plant that looks as good that could survive such abuse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b109f16520aded3e1f6e1be2e712dc981080b46c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b109f16520aded3e1f6e1be2e712dc981080b46c/0_0_2140_3000/713.jpg\" alt=\"In the pink: flower spikes of Eucomis comosa.\" width=\"713\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the pink: flower spikes of Eucomis comosa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imladris/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you want something bigger and even bolder, yet with similar cold tolerance, try <em>Eucomis comosa</em>, which sends up slender leaves and flower spikes almost a metre tall. The straight species has white blooms, but \u2018Sparkling burgundy\u2019 is so shockingly purple both in flower and in leaf it looks almost lit from within.

      "bodyText": "Every aspect of the pineapple lily Eucomis sp is just so unbelievably exotic. They hail from sunny southern Africa, throw up dazzling, jungly blooms that look like something straight out of a kid\u2019s story book and some can produce massive rosettes of leaves that tower over you. Yet if you have a sunny spot with well-drained soil, they are some of the easiest and most affordable garden plants to grow, even on our chilly North Atlantic islands. Like something from the understorey of a Rousseau painting that has come to life, Eucomis bicolor creates big, fat flower spikes about 30cm high, consisting of dozens of cream and lime green star-shaped blooms, each petal of which is delicately painted bright burgundy. Wide, strappy leaves are matched with a top-knot of leafy growth above the flower spike, making the whole plant look like a florist\u2019s recreation of a pineapple. This species is generally said to withstand temperatures as low as -10C, making it one of the hardiest of all eucomis, but when well mulched I have seen it take lows of -15C during really cold winters. All you have to do is spread a layer of leaf mould or bark about 10cm thick over the soil surface in autumn, which creates an insulating blanket to keep the worst of the frost from getting at the dormant bulb beneath. To give you an indication of how resilient this plant is, I had some in a wide, shallow patio pot at the bottom of my garden that kept coming back in full flower for six years without any care whatsoever. No watering, no fertiliser, nothing. I was so surprised when I noticed how well it was doing despite total neglect, I decided to leave it to see how long this could continue. (Terrible plant parent, I know.) To my surprise, it only gave up the ghost when the level of compost in the pot eventually degraded to the point at which it exposed the bulb. I can\u2019t think of any plant that looks as good that could survive such abuse. If you want something bigger and even bolder, yet with similar cold tolerance, try Eucomis comosa, which sends up slender leaves and flower spikes almost a metre tall. The straight species has white blooms, but \u2018Sparkling burgundy\u2019 is so shockingly purple both in flower and in leaf it looks almost lit from within. Like all eucomis, these will do best and be most winter-tolerant on free-draining sites that prevent their bulbs from sitting in soggy, wet soil. This makes them perfect for pot culture, in raised beds or on sunnier, drier sites. However, even in heavy clay soils in dappled shade, I have grown them successfully if the bulbs are planted at least 15cm deep with a generous layer of gravel mixed into the soil in the planting hole. Want them even bigger?

In an ideal universe, the Democrats would be assembling a broad-based never-Trump alliance ranging from actual socialists to principled libertarians like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/04/politics/justin-amash-leaving-gop/index.html\">Justin Amash</a>. The closest analogue would be the anti-fascist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/popular-front-European-coalition\">Popular Front</a> coalitions on the left that governed France and Spain in the mid-1930s.</p> <p>But to <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/one-paragraph-tells-us-how-wrong-pentagon-was-about-invasion-iraq-57002\">paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld</a>: \u201cYou go to war against Trump with the candidates you have, not the candidates you might want.\u201d</p> <p>To win the 2020 Democratic nomination, candidates have to (warning: shocking insight ahead) appeal to Democratic voters. And in the midst of a climate crisis and Gilded Age-style economic inequality, it should not be surprising that Democratic voters aspire to more than just a president who promises not to type racist tweets or to coo over Kim Jong-un.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In an ideal universe, the Democrats would be assembling a broad-based never-Trump alliance ranging from actual socialists to principled libertarians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So how self-destructive are the Democrats being as they launch the usual bidding wars to woo activist voters six months before the opening-gun Iowa caucuses?</p> <p>Forgive me for not rending my garments in horror over Democratic rhetoric.</p> <p>It seems unlikely that there are many potential anti-Trump voters (with the exception of a few right-of-center columnists) who turned on the CNN debates and decided that a mendacious, Vladimir Putin-loving, would-be autocrat in the White House is better than the 2020 Democrats.</p> <p>Under the traditional model for American presidential politics, winning candidates veer left (or right for the Republicans) in the primaries and then scamper back towards the center for the general election. So the real question is whether the leading Democrats have already staked out positions that would prevent the eventual nominee from modulating his or her tone in the fall of 2020.</p> <p>This is where it gets tricky.</p> <p>The most seemingly radical proposition offered so far is the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 2% <a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/ultra-millionaire-tax/\">wealth tax</a> on fortunes more than $50m that her campaign projects will raise $2.75tn over 10 years. While this proposal may scare the residents of Park Avenue penthouses and Silicon Valley mega-mansions, it polls surprisingly well with general election voters. An <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2617\">April national survey</a> by Quinnipiac University found that 60% of the voters (including a startling 32% of Republicans) approve of such a levy on the super-rich.</p> <p>The appeals of both Warren and the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders are rooted in their authenticity as dedicated battlers against economic injustice. If they suddenly began to preach about the virtues of patience and incremental steps, they would be derided as typical politicians willing to swap principle for power.</p> <p>Campaign statements are also not binding legal documents. Already, the California senator Kamala Harris has abandoned her reflexive support for the elimination of private insurance under the rubric of Medicare for All. Her new position, unveiled right before the Detroit debate, features \u201ca 10-year phase-in period\u201d. It is now so complicated that the <a href=\"https://kamalaharris.org/healthcare/\">health</a><a href=\"https://kamalaharris.org/healthcare/\">care section</a> on her website begins by complaining: \u201cOne of the problems with our politics is that it often demands 60-second soundbites.\u201d</p> <p>Does that healthcare adjustment make Harris a flip-flopper?</p> <p>That was the dread accusation that the Republicans brandished <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/memorable-campaign-ads/16/\">against John Kerry</a> in 2004. But it is hard to worry about that label in 2019 since objective truth no longer exists in the Trumpian political universe. Regardless of what the Democrats say in the debates, Trump will viciously portray his opponent as a socialistic America-hater in love with open borders and rat-infested inner cities.</p> <p>After covering the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign, I better understand the value of inspiration and the danger of consultant-driven caution. Remember, it was just <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/flashback-bidens-2012-endorsement-of-same-sex-marriage-471856195543\">seven years ago</a> when Joe Biden got ahead of Barack Obama by endorsing gay marriage. Should the Democrats really have stuck with the seemingly safe 2012 moderate position of backing civil unions?</p> <p>Fifteen months before the 2020 election, it is nearly impossible to know the best way of wresting power from Donald Trump. But it is safe to predict that the race will not be decided by a few intemperate debate answers in the summer of 2019.</p>",

Every Democratic debate prompts a wailing wall of pundits and prognosticators lamenting how the party has lurched too far left to defeat Donald Trump. The debate formats accentuate the problem, with TV moderators stoking controversy with their questions and rigid time constraints (CNN in Detroit limited responses to 15 and 30 seconds) making every candidate sound shrill. Trailing candidates, desperate to qualify for the next debates, also have incentives to launch ideological attacks in hopes of creating a viral moment. Yet the editorial page odes to dynamic moderation have some validity. In an ideal universe, the Democrats would be assembling a broad-based never-Trump alliance ranging from actual socialists to principled libertarians like Justin Amash. The closest analogue would be the anti-fascist Popular Front coalitions on the left that governed France and Spain in the mid-1930s. But to paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld: \u201cYou go to war against Trump with the candidates you have, not the candidates you might want.\u201d To win the 2020 Democratic nomination, candidates have to (warning: shocking insight ahead) appeal to Democratic voters. And in the midst of a climate crisis and Gilded Age-style economic inequality, it should not be surprising that Democratic voters aspire to more than just a president who promises not to type racist tweets or to coo over Kim Jong-un. So how self-destructive are the Democrats being as they launch the usual bidding wars to woo activist voters six months before the opening-gun Iowa caucuses? Forgive me for not rending my garments in horror over Democratic rhetoric. It seems unlikely that there are many potential anti-Trump voters (with the exception of a few right-of-center columnists) who turned on the CNN debates and decided that a mendacious, Vladimir Putin-loving, would-be autocrat in the White House is better than the 2020 Democrats. Under the traditional model for American presidential politics, winning candidates veer left (or right for the Republicans) in the primaries and then scamper back towards the center for the general election. So the real question is whether the leading Democrats have already staked out positions that would prevent the eventual nominee from modulating his or her tone in the fall of 2020. This is where it gets tricky. The most seemingly radical proposition offered so far is the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 2% wealth tax on fortunes more than $50m that her campaign projects will raise $2.75tn over 10 years. While this proposal may scare the residents of Park Avenue penthouses and Silicon Valley mega-mansions, it polls surprisingly well with general election voters. An April national survey by Quinnipiac University found that 60% of the voters (including a startling 32% of Republicans) approve of such a levy on the super-rich. The appeals of both Warren and the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders are rooted in their authenticity as dedicated battlers against economic injustice. If they suddenly began to preach about the virtues of patience and incremental steps, they would be derided as typical politicians willing to swap principle for power. Campaign statements are also not binding legal documents. Already, the California senator Kamala Harris has abandoned her reflexive support for the elimination of private insurance under the rubric of Medicare for All. Her new position, unveiled right before the Detroit debate, features \u201ca 10-year phase-in period\u201d. It is now so complicated that the healthcare section on her website begins by complaining: \u201cOne of the problems with our politics is that it often demands 60-second soundbites.\u201d Does that healthcare adjustment make Harris a flip-flopper? That was the dread accusation that the Republicans brandished against John Kerry in 2004. But it is hard to worry about that label in 2019 since objective truth no longer exists in the Trumpian political universe. Regardless of what the Democrats say in the debates, Trump will viciously portray his opponent as a socialistic America-hater in love with open borders and rat-infested inner cities. After covering the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign, I better understand the value of inspiration and the danger of consultant-driven caution. Remember, it was just seven years ago when Joe Biden got ahead of Barack Obama by endorsing gay marriage. Should the Democrats really have stuck with the seemingly safe 2012 moderate position of backing civil unions? Fifteen months before the 2020 election, it is nearly impossible to know the best way of wresting power from Donald Trump. But it is safe to predict that the race will not be decided by a few intemperate debate answers in the summer of 2019.",

Academics at the University of Warwick measured the effect of the industry\u2019s responsible gambling slogan: \u201cWhen the fun stops, stop\u201d and found it did not show any significant effect on gambling behaviour. They also pointed to the fact that the word fun is printed in much larger font than any other word in the message, which is meant to promote more responsible gambling. Researchers from the university\u2019s psychology department asked 506 people, who said they were fans of Premier League football and also had experience of sports betting, to place small wagers after viewing adverts, some of which contained the warning label and some of which did not.

As police investigated the possibility that the gun rampage in the Texas city was a hate crime aimed at Latino immigrants, O\u2019Rourke accused the president of being a \u201cracist\u201d who was trying to make Americans \u201cafraid\u201d of migrants. There was a link between Trump\u2019s hostile comments about Muslims, migrants and people of colour to a rise in hate crimes, O\u2019Rourke told CNN after cutting short campaigning in Nevada to return to El Paso, his hometown and a city he represented for six years in Congress. Asked if the shooting was Trump\u2019s fault for inflaming hatred, he said \u201cyes\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a rise in hate crimes every single one of the last three years during an administration where you have a president who has called Mexicans rapists and criminals, though Mexican immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than people born in this country. \u201cHe has tried to make us afraid of them \u2026 attempting to ban all Muslims from this country.

He is stoking racism in this country ... and it fundamentally changes the character of the country and leads to violence.\u201d El Paso police chief Greg Allen said on Saturday night that authorities were examining a manifesto from the suspect and said \u201cthere is a potential nexus to a hate crime\u201d. But officials declined to elaborate and said the investigation was continuing. But a four-page statement posted on 8chan, an online message board often used by extremists, and believed to have been authored by the suspect, called the Walmart attack \u201ca response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas\u201d. O\u2019Rourke, who said he was proud of the way El Pasoans were \u201cstanding up\u201d for the victims of the shooting, also said more effort must be made to bring about reform of the country\u2019s gun laws. \u201cWe must make sure that we change our laws so we make it harder for this to happen again.

We can beat the gun manufacturers.\u201d Shortly after the shooting and before its death toll was widely reported, White House officials said Trump had been briefed while spending the weekend at his New Jersey golf club. He conveyed his initial reaction on Twitter, writing that the shooting was \u201cterrible\u201d and that he was in close consultation with state officials. Later Saturday night, Trump tweeted condolences. \u201cToday\u2019s shooting in El Paso, Texas was not only tragic, it was an act of cowardice. I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn today\u2019s hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people. Melania and I send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the great people of Texas.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>What more can we ask of Jacob Rees-Mogg? I mean, bravo. His list of language rules was absolutely classic. In the soap opera of the news, he\u2019s becoming as reliable a performer as the much-missed Silvio Berlusconi, who must surely be overdue a saucy Christmas special return. Maybe involving some of the newer characters. Perhaps Silvio starts stalking Meghan Markle and is discovered in a hedge in Windsor Great Park, binoculars held steadily in his non-masturbating hand.</p> <p>I\u2019m just throwing ideas out there \u2013 it\u2019s fan fiction really \u2013 because it\u2019s been such a tempestuous patch for the soap opera of the news. What with Brexit and Trump and Boris, some people are saying that the soap opera of the news has jumped the shark. After all, it\u2019s not a cliffhanger if the character <em>always</em> falls off the cliff. It\u2019s no good if <em>every</em> new episode begins with plummeting and screaming and smashing and more screaming. As the literalist didn\u2019t complain at the public hanging, where\u2019s the suspense?</p> <p>A lot of people are really fed up of the soap opera of the news. And that\u2019s before we get to those who claim that the soap opera of the news is actually a reflection of real events, which I personally think is an unhelpful way of viewing anything over which you have no effective control. Start thinking something like that actually matters and you\u2019re consigning yourself to misery and rage. Hence football hooliganism.</p> <p>So fair play to Jacob Rees-Mogg for calming us down with a bit of what we came for: the stereotypically stuffy, old-fashioned MP issuing a list of stuffy, old-fashioned rules about how his staff should write. This is exactly the sort of thing we all love or hate Jacob Rees-Mogg for, and if you\u2019re one of the tiny minority who are indifferent to Jacob Rees-Mogg (and, if so, well done you because that is a masterclass in creative contrarianism), then there\u2019s still a chance you care how English is written.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He must realise that his Edwardian vision is threatened by the mercilessness of the rightwing position</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before I slag off his stupid rules, let me start with a word in their defence: if they are rules exclusively for how letters written in Rees-Mogg\u2019s name are to be composed, then that\u2019s OK, I suppose. If he\u2019s signing them, then he\u2019s got a right to insist on whatever he wants. He could have little hearts instead of dots on the \u2018i\u2019s, and an emoticon of a face being sick instead of \u201cYours faithfully\u201d if that\u2019s how he wants to come across. And anyway, maybe it\u2019s part of some long-running bet \u2013 a sort of reverse of that kids\u2019 TV game Bogies \u2013 whereby, if he can get to 2025 without ever writing the words \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cgot\u201d, Vladimir Putin will give him a billion pounds. He can\u2019t risk a slovenly aide queering a sweet deal like that.</p> <p>But, if it\u2019s not that, his rules puzzle me. Rees-Mogg seems quite keen on Britain, doesn\u2019t he? Some would say that the application of his political vision is ruining Britain; it could also be argued that the Britain he likes is a dated and rose-tinted image, or just the Britain of the rich and posh; nevertheless I\u2019d be surprised if he doesn\u2019t, at the very least, sincerely think he likes Britain.</p> <p>Assuming so, he must be proud of the English language. It is the country\u2019s most unarguably successful export \u2013 the most widely spoken language in history, an unequalled vector for communication and art. And yet his approach to it is the antithesis of the spirit that has made it great. In the English language, there are no rules that supersede usage. If the majority of speakers and writers start using \u201chopefully\u201d to mean \u201cit is to be hoped\u201d, rather than \u201cin a hopeful way\u201d, then that becomes the word\u2019s primary definition. The speakers have spoken and the rest is linguistic history.</p> <p>Rees-Mogg\u2019s discomfort with his tongue\u2019s bottom-up usage flexibility is laid bare in his restrictive stipulations. He doesn\u2019t want \u201chopefully\u201d to be used at all. On some level, he obviously accepts that its meaning has changed but, for the crime of undergoing that change, the word is excised entirely.</p> <p>This is strange in light of his belief in free-market economics. The human consequences of unfettered corporate greed, of millions of people unsheltered by the state from economic misfortune and powerful financial interests, are arguably almost as bad as a full-blown grocer\u2019s apostrophe pandemic, yet in the former arena, he thinks it unwise to intervene. The livelihoods of people in depressed areas must trust to luck, but in order to ensure the use of imperial rather than metric units in departmental memos, he is willing to exercise ministerial power.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit crazy. On the one hand, the tender concern for the trappings of the old days \u2013 the clothes, the accent, the patterns of speech, the nanny, the fervent religiosity \u2013 and, on the other, heartless libertarianism and opportunistic populism. Even if he doesn\u2019t see the NHS, a tradition of trade unionism or centuries of immigration as aspects of the nation that he wants to conserve, he must realise that his Edwardian vision of Britain is also threatened by the mercilessness of the rightwing position.</p> <p>Without union with Scotland and a stable climate, there is no recognisable United Kingdom and there will be no more cricket on village greens. This is the future he toys with when he pushes for a no-deal Brexit or meets the likes of Steve Bannon. His Christian faith compels him to oppose abortion, but not to advocate a society that redistributes its wealth to protect the vulnerable. Surely his commitment to the sanctity of human life shouldn\u2019t be restricted to the foetal stage?</p> <p>This vision of conservatism is all over the place. Calling it cruel makes it sound too organised. It\u2019s inconsistent and muddle-headed, seemingly based on little more than a childlike attraction to the aesthetics of poshness, like wearing a bow-tie to eat trifle. In formulating his entire political stance, he has failed to observe the only one of his rules with which I wholeheartedly agree: \u201cCHECK your work.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "What more can we ask of Jacob Rees-Mogg? I mean, bravo. His list of language rules was absolutely classic. In the soap opera of the news, he\u2019s becoming as reliable a performer as the much-missed Silvio Berlusconi, who must surely be overdue a saucy Christmas special return. Maybe involving some of the newer characters. Perhaps Silvio starts stalking Meghan Markle and is discovered in a hedge in Windsor Great Park, binoculars held steadily in his non-masturbating hand. I\u2019m just throwing ideas out there \u2013 it\u2019s fan fiction really \u2013 because it\u2019s been such a tempestuous patch for the soap opera of the news. What with Brexit and Trump and Boris, some people are saying that the soap opera of the news has jumped the shark. After all, it\u2019s not a cliffhanger if the character always falls off the cliff. It\u2019s no good if every new episode begins with plummeting and screaming and smashing and more screaming. As the literalist didn\u2019t complain at the public hanging, where\u2019s the suspense? A lot of people are really fed up of the soap opera of the news. And that\u2019s before we get to those who claim that the soap opera of the news is actually a reflection of real events, which I personally think is an unhelpful way of viewing anything over which you have no effective control. Start thinking something like that actually matters and you\u2019re consigning yourself to misery and rage. Hence football hooliganism. So fair play to Jacob Rees-Mogg for calming us down with a bit of what we came for: the stereotypically stuffy, old-fashioned MP issuing a list of stuffy, old-fashioned rules about how his staff should write. This is exactly the sort of thing we all love or hate Jacob Rees-Mogg for, and if you\u2019re one of the tiny minority who are indifferent to Jacob Rees-Mogg (and, if so, well done you because that is a masterclass in creative contrarianism), then there\u2019s still a chance you care how English is written. Before I slag off his stupid rules, let me start with a word in their defence: if they are rules exclusively for how letters written in Rees-Mogg\u2019s name are to be composed, then that\u2019s OK, I suppose. If he\u2019s signing them, then he\u2019s got a right to insist on whatever he wants. He could have little hearts instead of dots on the \u2018i\u2019s, and an emoticon of a face being sick instead of \u201cYours faithfully\u201d if that\u2019s how he wants to come across. And anyway, maybe it\u2019s part of some long-running bet \u2013 a sort of reverse of that kids\u2019 TV game Bogies \u2013 whereby, if he can get to 2025 without ever writing the words \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cgot\u201d, Vladimir Putin will give him a billion pounds. He can\u2019t risk a slovenly aide queering a sweet deal like that. But, if it\u2019s not that, his rules puzzle me. Rees-Mogg seems quite keen on Britain, doesn\u2019t he? Some would say that the application of his political vision is ruining Britain; it could also be argued that the Britain he likes is a dated and rose-tinted image, or just the Britain of the rich and posh; nevertheless I\u2019d be surprised if he doesn\u2019t, at the very least, sincerely think he likes Britain. Assuming so, he must be proud of the English language. It is the country\u2019s most unarguably successful export \u2013 the most widely spoken language in history, an unequalled vector for communication and art. And yet his approach to it is the antithesis of the spirit that has made it great. In the English language, there are no rules that supersede usage. If the majority of speakers and writers start using \u201chopefully\u201d to mean \u201cit is to be hoped\u201d, rather than \u201cin a hopeful way\u201d, then that becomes the word\u2019s primary definition. The speakers have spoken and the rest is linguistic history. Rees-Mogg\u2019s discomfort with his tongue\u2019s bottom-up usage flexibility is laid bare in his restrictive stipulations. He doesn\u2019t want \u201chopefully\u201d to be used at all. On some level, he obviously accepts that its meaning has changed but, for the crime of undergoing that change, the word is excised entirely. This is strange in light of his belief in free-market economics. The human consequences of unfettered corporate greed, of millions of people unsheltered by the state from economic misfortune and powerful financial interests, are arguably almost as bad as a full-blown grocer\u2019s apostrophe pandemic, yet in the former arena, he thinks it unwise to intervene. The livelihoods of people in depressed areas must trust to luck, but in order to ensure the use of imperial rather than metric units in departmental memos, he is willing to exercise ministerial power. It\u2019s a bit crazy. On the one hand, the tender concern for the trappings of the old days \u2013 the clothes, the accent, the patterns of speech, the nanny, the fervent religiosity \u2013 and, on the other, heartless libertarianism and opportunistic populism. Even if he doesn\u2019t see the NHS, a tradition of trade unionism or centuries of immigration as aspects of the nation that he wants to conserve, he must realise that his Edwardian vision of Britain is also threatened by the mercilessness of the rightwing position. Without union with Scotland and a stable climate, there is no recognisable United Kingdom and there will be no more cricket on village greens. This is the future he toys with when he pushes for a no-deal Brexit or meets the likes of Steve Bannon. His Christian faith compels him to oppose abortion, but not to advocate a society that redistributes its wealth to protect the vulnerable. Surely his commitment to the sanctity of human life shouldn\u2019t be restricted to the foetal stage? This vision of conservatism is all over the place. Calling it cruel makes it sound too organised. It\u2019s inconsistent and muddle-headed, seemingly based on little more than a childlike attraction to the aesthetics of poshness, like wearing a bow-tie to eat trifle. In formulating his entire political stance, he has failed to observe the only one of his rules with which I wholeheartedly agree: \u201cCHECK your work.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The day before I meet Aisling Bea at her home in London, she gets in touch to ask my biscuit preferences and I reply, with a journalistic sigh, knowing this is destined to be a puff piece. Except, when I arrive, she serves me tea with a milk chocolate digestive (not on my list, obviously) because, \u201cPrincess,\u201d my list was ridiculous, and I will get what I\u2019m given. The disappointment is a relief, because it releases me from the shackles of love and allows the scathing hatchet job to follow. Buckle up!</p> <p>Though <em>This Way Up</em>, the tender, funny sitcom Bea has written and stars in is yet to air, you will already recognise her from the telly. As a regular panellist on game shows and a standup on <em>Live at the Apollo</em>, and an actor in dramas including <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-fall\" title=\"\">The Fall</a></em>, she has been elegantly circling fame since she moved to London from Kildare, and enrolled in drama school. It was the kind of drama school where they learned \u201chistorical dance\u201d, and had to spend an hour pretending to be mud \u2013 it turned out to be great training for a comedian.</p> <p>After a role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/07/funny-messy-real-sharon-horgan-most-watchable-woman-on-tv-catastrophe-divorce-rob-delaney\" title=\"\">Sharon Horgan</a>\u2019s sitcom <em>Dead Boss</em> she tried standup, and in 2013 was nominated for best newcomer at Edinburgh, with stories about her family, Ireland, feminism and death. If she got bad reviews, she\u2019d remember her mother Helen\u2019s advice. Helen had been a jockey in Kildare who told her that when she won everyone would compliment the horse, but if she lost, they\u2019d say it was her fault.</p> <p>Bea was raised by women, eight aunts, one nun \u2013 her father died when she was three. Ten years later her mother told her he\u2019d taken his own life. She had waited for two reasons: the first, she didn\u2019t think her daughters were ready to hear the truth, and the second, suicide was only decriminalised two years after her husband\u2019s death. There was a time in Irish history when if you attempted suicide, you were punished by hanging. Bea suddenly hated him. She vowed never to talk about him again. So it wasn\u2019t until 2017, aged 33, her career bubbling to life, that many of her friends learned the details of his death.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/aisling-bea-my-fathers-death-has-given-me-a-love-of-men-of-their-vulnerability-and-tenderness\" title=\"\">She wrote about </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/aisling-bea-my-fathers-death-has-given-me-a-love-of-men-of-their-vulnerability-and-tenderness\" title=\"\">it for the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/aisling-bea-my-fathers-death-has-given-me-a-love-of-men-of-their-vulnerability-and-tenderness\" title=\"\">Guardian</a></em>, partly because she wanted, \u201cto put a beginning, middle and end on my experience,\u201d partly because she didn\u2019t want it thrown at her in an interview later and partly to reach out to people who were suffering. She was not prepared for the reaction, but we\u2019ll come to that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffe47c3ecafc6854480ee671cadc864b517c2ec2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffe47c3ecafc6854480ee671cadc864b517c2ec2/0_374_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sofa so good: in her new comedy This Way Up, in which she plays a foreign-language teacher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sofa so good: in her new comedy This Way Up, in which she plays a foreign-language teacher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Lawrence/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>\u201cEat your biscuit,\u201d</strong></em> she says, firmly. We are drinking green tea in her living room, where a piano and trophy shelf compete for space, and through the glass doors her \u201clady garden\u201d is alive with bees and jasmine. She has been working too much, she feels a little mad. After writing, then filming six episodes of her show, she moved to Rome to shoot a romantic comedy, but worked on edits in the evenings \u2013 this is a rare afternoon, when she can sit on her own sofa, under no pressure to make strangers laugh.</p> <p>In <em>This Way Up</em>, Bea (who took that stage name in memory of her dad, Brian) plays Aine, a foreign-language school worker who\u2019s recovering from a \u201cteeny little nervous breakdown\u201d, with her sister, played by Horgan. \u201cWhen I started writing the characters, I\u2019d think, what\u2019s their loneliness? Is it being the only person in an environment that does a certain job, or is it the relationship they\u2019re not happy in? Is it being an immigrant?\u201d Loneliness is something she thinks about a lot.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with being alone. I\u2019ve never really been alone. I have an amazing family, amazing friends, I\u2019ve been in amazing relationships\u2026\u201d In recent years, she has been snapped on red carpets with boyfriends including Michael Sheen and Andrew Garfield. \u201cBut loneliness,\u201d she says, \u201cfor me comes from being your own worst enemy. In not being able to trust your head sometimes, and what it\u2019s going to do next. That\u2019s a wound and a gift.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s not afraid of an audience booing. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of myself. What if I am not on my side that day?\u201d That\u2019s why she has a pint before a performance. \u201cIt\u2019s not for confidence, it\u2019s to stop getting in your own way. To forget you\u2019re on stage before the <em>other</em> you realises you\u2019re there. To me, that is a really lonely feeling. Because it\u2019s just you and yourself in that little battle.\u201d </p> <p>Peppered throughout our conversation are references to books about the brain and the body, which perform, in 2019, as self-help guides for people, like Bea, who are constantly striving and constantly questioning. \u201cThe biggest constant in terms of my friends is to do with the plastic-ness of their brains \u2013 who\u2019s working on themselves and who will admit that they\u2019re idiots sometimes? We\u2019re all having these mini-breakdowns, some realisations and then some expansions.\u201d</p> <p>One such expansion has been her increased activism. Bea was a supporter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/26/irish-abortion-referendum-result-count-begins-live\" title=\"\">the change to Ireland\u2019s abortion laws</a>: she and Horgan dressed in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/21/the-handmaids-tale-recap-season-three-episode-seven-the-fight-is-on\" title=\"\">Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a></em> bonnets urging people to vote, and wrote a comic essay published in a collection titled <em>Repeal the 8th</em>, which explains the mystery of women. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c5248ae2f69d6d51cf2e7a31c68a6a8c80f4d6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c5248ae2f69d6d51cf2e7a31c68a6a8c80f4d6d/0_97_6398_3838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019re all having these mini-breakdowns, some realisations and then some expansions\u2019: with This Way Up co-star Sharon Horgan (right) and producer Clelia Mountford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re all having these mini-breakdowns, some realisations and then some expansions\u2019: with This Way Up co-star Sharon Horgan (right) and producer Clelia Mountford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of Bea\u2019s gifts is to slide politics in when you\u2019re not watching, like vegetables, chopped up very small. Her standup is broad and jolly, with outbreaks of jokes about women\u2019s safety. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/weemissbea/\" title=\"\">Her Instagram</a> looks glamorous, but includes credits for ethical fashion and charity-shop tips. She is a regular on the <em><a href=\"https://guiltyfeminist.com/\" title=\"\">Guilty Feminist</a></em> podcast. And, while it looks as though she\u2019s gamely chuckling on panel shows, she is also taking notes.</p> <p>\u201cThere are only a few regulars who are female. And still, no one has ever come to us and asked our advice on how to make them easier for women. Which I find interesting, not being asked: \u2018What makes this space dangerous for you?\u2019 It\u2019s the little moments.\u201d The time spent in the makeup chair, or if there\u2019s another woman onstage and if so, where she\u2019s sitting, and how many women were in the writers room, and panellists not interrupting those who speak softly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s another comedian allowing you to make the punchline, not assuming you\u2019re setting up a joke for them. But it\u2019s like, if someone doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re fit enough to be on the pitch and you\u2019re going for the goal. They run on and go, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got one for the team.\u2019 But you knew you could score. It\u2019s not just about visibility. Diversity is being invited to the party, and inclusion is feeling you belong.\u201d</p> <p>She talks very fast and with great precision, about her belief in quotas, in listening, in admitting when we get things wrong, and then she stops, slumping slightly. \u201cBut, nobody wants to walk around being angry any more. I don\u2019t want to have to talk about this. I\u2019m bored talking about it. This is probably the least funny I can be, talking about gender and comedy. I can\u2019t be as joyful. It gets in the way. It\u2019s exhausting. And it doesn\u2019t allow me to do the thing I\u2019m supposed to be doing. You just want to go into your game, you don\u2019t want to worry about walking home.\u201d</p> <p>She sips her tea. \u201cThere are two schools of thought. One is survival of the fittest: if you\u2019re good enough, you will get there. But, you are being good enough within someone else\u2019s realm. And the fact of the matter is, if you create a shouty environment that\u2019s all about competitiveness, you are rooting out a different type of person. So on panel shows people who aren\u2019t as loud don\u2019t get to speak.\u201d In March, she stood down as a team captain on <em><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/8-out-of-10-cats\" title=\"\">8 Out of 10 Cats</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"195c8b67c3045a6437b95c2c28854d802a385269\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/195c8b67c3045a6437b95c2c28854d802a385269/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018On panel shows people who aren\u2019t as loud don\u2019t get to speak\u2019: with Richard Ayoade on 8 Out of 10 Cats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018On panel shows people who aren\u2019t as loud don\u2019t get to speak\u2019: with Richard Ayoade on 8 Out of 10 Cats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Endemol Shine/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>When Bea was </strong></em><em><strong>10</strong></em> and she learned the truth about her dad, her story was set. \u201cThe narrative was, I\u2019m not supposed to talk about this.\u201d It continued throughout her life. \u201cIf I do, people will know I\u2019m sad and they won\u2019t find me funny any more. I\u2019ll be the person known for that thing. And I\u2019ll upset my family. And I am the way I am because there\u2019s no men in my family. And I have got to where I am in spite of childhood tragedy. But actually, none of that is true.\u201d</p> <p>There were many myths, she realised recently. One was the idea that, not only had her father abandoned them, but, as he didn\u2019t name Bea in his suicide note, he had forgotten her. Then, 20 years later, a parcel arrived. A box of his things, including the photos he had been looking at when he died \u2013 they were nearly all of her. In her <em>Guardian</em> article she wrote a letter to him, which ended: \u201cI am your daughter and I am really fucking funny, just like you. But, unlike you, I\u2019m going to stop being it for five minutes and write our story in the hope it may help someone who didn\u2019t get to have a box turn up, or who may not feel \u2018in their right mind\u2019 right now and needs a reminder to find hope.\u201d When the piece came out, it felt like she had finally buried him.</p> <p>Then the letters started coming \u2013 from people who had felt suicidal and from people whose loved ones had killed themselves, and from her dad\u2019s friends, who had disappeared after his death.</p> <p>\u201cI went over to meet them, to help them talk about their mental-health issues. And I\u2019ve still got a comedy career, I think. And I don\u2019t think people find me any less funny because of it. And I realise, I\u2019m so bolstered and helped by the men in my life. All the messages, on so many platforms, can be a bit of a punch to the tummy sometimes. But the variety of types of people who write in, like I\u2019m a radio show, absolutely built up my empathy muscle. And it\u2019s allowed me to stop thinking I was the only one with that story\u2026\u201d She is trying very quietly not to cry. \u201cOh, I hate getting all upset. And this is why I wrote the article because I just get wobbly talking about it. Right\u2026\u201d She takes a dramatic breath. \u201cThe true narrative is there are a million different stories, and maybe the one you think is real is not the real story.\u201d</p> <p>Once, she went to see a psychic and was upset when the woman couldn\u2019t get in touch with her dad. \u201cI\u2019m like,\u201d she snickers, \u2018Are you even a real psychic?\u2019 But the psychic replied, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s just that your dad\u2019s death doesn\u2019t define you.\u2019 \u201cWhat if,\u201d Bea thought, then, \u201cI was able to let that go?\u201d Would she still be able to write? She pauses. \u201cThese are all realisations I\u2019m having now I\u2019m in my \u2018white lady expanding\u2019 stage.\u201d She offers me another bad biscuit, which I eat.</p> <p>There is a Whatsapp group that consists of, among others, Lena Dunham, Richard Curtis, and Aisling Bea, where the sole topic of conversation is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\" title=\"\">Love Island</a></em>. \u201cIT IS A COMPLICATED THING AS A FEMINIST AND PERSON WITH A BRAIN AND I KNOW IT IS TRICKERY, BUT IT IS ALSO ANTHROPOLOGY AND TALES AS OLD AS TIME,\u201d she emails me later, caps lock on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Money isn\u2019t going to fill us up, so what\u2019s the thing? Each other. And we can feel it on a big level at the moment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Telly is important to her, in part because of what it reveals about what we need. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised shows like <em>Queer Eye</em> and <em>Marie Kondo</em> are capturing people,\u201d she says, tucking her feet up on to the sofa, \u201cbecause it\u2019s about communal ideas of help, as well as getting rid of your old shoes. Money isn\u2019t going to fill us up so what\u2019s the thing? Each other. And that sounds cutesy-cutesy, but we can feel it on a big level at the moment. If we\u2019re relying on fucking Boris Johnson to fix things for us, that won\u2019t happen in our lifetime. And it\u2019s awful. It\u2019s fucking awful that <a href=\"https://helprefugees.org/\" title=\"\">Help Refugees</a> has to go over to Calais with a lot of fucking comedians. That people have to take it upon themselves to leave food outside Waitrose to help their fellow man because the government isn\u2019t doing anything about it. But the cavalry are not coming.\u201d</p> <p>When she left drama school (after an earlier degree in French and philosophy) she expected to be playing Medea within a week. \u201cBut as Sharon Horgan always says, waiting around for great female parts doesn\u2019t work. So you have to write them. This idea of the giant parental system looking after us just isn\u2019t happening.

      "bodyText": "The day before I meet Aisling Bea at her home in London, she gets in touch to ask my biscuit preferences and I reply, with a journalistic sigh, knowing this is destined to be a puff piece. Except, when I arrive, she serves me tea with a milk chocolate digestive (not on my list, obviously) because, \u201cPrincess,\u201d my list was ridiculous, and I will get what I\u2019m given. The disappointment is a relief, because it releases me from the shackles of love and allows the scathing hatchet job to follow. Buckle up! Though This Way Up, the tender, funny sitcom Bea has written and stars in is yet to air, you will already recognise her from the telly. As a regular panellist on game shows and a standup on Live at the Apollo, and an actor in dramas including The Fall, she has been elegantly circling fame since she moved to London from Kildare, and enrolled in drama school. It was the kind of drama school where they learned \u201chistorical dance\u201d, and had to spend an hour pretending to be mud \u2013 it turned out to be great training for a comedian. After a role in Sharon Horgan\u2019s sitcom Dead Boss she tried standup, and in 2013 was nominated for best newcomer at Edinburgh, with stories about her family, Ireland, feminism and death. If she got bad reviews, she\u2019d remember her mother Helen\u2019s advice. Helen had been a jockey in Kildare who told her that when she won everyone would compliment the horse, but if she lost, they\u2019d say it was her fault. Bea was raised by women, eight aunts, one nun \u2013 her father died when she was three. Ten years later her mother told her he\u2019d taken his own life. She had waited for two reasons: the first, she didn\u2019t think her daughters were ready to hear the truth, and the second, suicide was only decriminalised two years after her husband\u2019s death. There was a time in Irish history when if you attempted suicide, you were punished by hanging. Bea suddenly hated him. She vowed never to talk about him again. So it wasn\u2019t until 2017, aged 33, her career bubbling to life, that many of her friends learned the details of his death. She wrote about it for the Guardian, partly because she wanted, \u201cto put a beginning, middle and end on my experience,\u201d partly because she didn\u2019t want it thrown at her in an interview later and partly to reach out to people who were suffering. She was not prepared for the reaction, but we\u2019ll come to that. \u201cEat your biscuit,\u201d she says, firmly. We are drinking green tea in her living room, where a piano and trophy shelf compete for space, and through the glass doors her \u201clady garden\u201d is alive with bees and jasmine. She has been working too much, she feels a little mad. After writing, then filming six episodes of her show, she moved to Rome to shoot a romantic comedy, but worked on edits in the evenings \u2013 this is a rare afternoon, when she can sit on her own sofa, under no pressure to make strangers laugh. In This Way Up, Bea (who took that stage name in memory of her dad, Brian) plays Aine, a foreign-language school worker who\u2019s recovering from a \u201cteeny little nervous breakdown\u201d, with her sister, played by Horgan. \u201cWhen I started writing the characters, I\u2019d think, what\u2019s their loneliness? Is it being the only person in an environment that does a certain job, or is it the relationship they\u2019re not happy in? Is it being an immigrant?\u201d Loneliness is something she thinks about a lot. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with being alone. I\u2019ve never really been alone. I have an amazing family, amazing friends, I\u2019ve been in amazing relationships\u2026\u201d In recent years, she has been snapped on red carpets with boyfriends including Michael Sheen and Andrew Garfield. \u201cBut loneliness,\u201d she says, \u201cfor me comes from being your own worst enemy. In not being able to trust your head sometimes, and what it\u2019s going to do next. That\u2019s a wound and a gift.\u201d She\u2019s not afraid of an audience booing. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of myself. What if I am not on my side that day?\u201d That\u2019s why she has a pint before a performance. \u201cIt\u2019s not for confidence, it\u2019s to stop getting in your own way. To forget you\u2019re on stage before the other you realises you\u2019re there. To me, that is a really lonely feeling. Because it\u2019s just you and yourself in that little battle.\u201d Peppered throughout our conversation are references to books about the brain and the body, which perform, in 2019, as self-help guides for people, like Bea, who are constantly striving and constantly questioning. \u201cThe biggest constant in terms of my friends is to do with the plastic-ness of their brains \u2013 who\u2019s working on themselves and who will admit that they\u2019re idiots sometimes? We\u2019re all having these mini-breakdowns, some realisations and then some expansions.\u201d One such expansion has been her increased activism. Bea was a supporter of the change to Ireland\u2019s abortion laws: she and Horgan dressed in Handmaid\u2019s Tale bonnets urging people to vote, and wrote a comic essay published in a collection titled Repeal the 8th, which explains the mystery of women. One of Bea\u2019s gifts is to slide politics in when you\u2019re not watching, like vegetables, chopped up very small. Her standup is broad and jolly, with outbreaks of jokes about women\u2019s safety. Her Instagram looks glamorous, but includes credits for ethical fashion and charity-shop tips. She is a regular on the Guilty Feminist podcast. And, while it looks as though she\u2019s gamely chuckling on panel shows, she is also taking notes. \u201cThere are only a few regulars who are female. And still, no one has ever come to us and asked our advice on how to make them easier for women. Which I find interesting, not being asked: \u2018What makes this space dangerous for you?\u2019 It\u2019s the little moments.\u201d The time spent in the makeup chair, or if there\u2019s another woman onstage and if so, where she\u2019s sitting, and how many women were in the writers room, and panellists not interrupting those who speak softly. \u201cIt\u2019s another comedian allowing you to make the punchline, not assuming you\u2019re setting up a joke for them. But it\u2019s like, if someone doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re fit enough to be on the pitch and you\u2019re going for the goal. They run on and go, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got one for the team.\u2019 But you knew you could score. It\u2019s not just about visibility. Diversity is being invited to the party, and inclusion is feeling you belong.\u201d She talks very fast and with great precision, about her belief in quotas, in listening, in admitting when we get things wrong, and then she stops, slumping slightly. \u201cBut, nobody wants to walk around being angry any more. I don\u2019t want to have to talk about this. I\u2019m bored talking about it. This is probably the least funny I can be, talking about gender and comedy. I can\u2019t be as joyful. It gets in the way. It\u2019s exhausting. And it doesn\u2019t allow me to do the thing I\u2019m supposed to be doing. You just want to go into your game, you don\u2019t want to worry about walking home.\u201d She sips her tea. \u201cThere are two schools of thought. One is survival of the fittest: if you\u2019re good enough, you will get there. But, you are being good enough within someone else\u2019s realm. And the fact of the matter is, if you create a shouty environment that\u2019s all about competitiveness, you are rooting out a different type of person. So on panel shows people who aren\u2019t as loud don\u2019t get to speak.\u201d In March, she stood down as a team captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats. When Bea was 10 and she learned the truth about her dad, her story was set. \u201cThe narrative was, I\u2019m not supposed to talk about this.\u201d It continued throughout her life. \u201cIf I do, people will know I\u2019m sad and they won\u2019t find me funny any more. I\u2019ll be the person known for that thing. And I\u2019ll upset my family. And I am the way I am because there\u2019s no men in my family. And I have got to where I am in spite of childhood tragedy. But actually, none of that is true.\u201d There were many myths, she realised recently. One was the idea that, not only had her father abandoned them, but, as he didn\u2019t name Bea in his suicide note, he had forgotten her. Then, 20 years later, a parcel arrived. A box of his things, including the photos he had been looking at when he died \u2013 they were nearly all of her. In her Guardian article she wrote a letter to him, which ended: \u201cI am your daughter and I am really fucking funny, just like you. But, unlike you, I\u2019m going to stop being it for five minutes and write our story in the hope it may help someone who didn\u2019t get to have a box turn up, or who may not feel \u2018in their right mind\u2019 right now and needs a reminder to find hope.\u201d When the piece came out, it felt like she had finally buried him. Then the letters started coming \u2013 from people who had felt suicidal and from people whose loved ones had killed themselves, and from her dad\u2019s friends, who had disappeared after his death. \u201cI went over to meet them, to help them talk about their mental-health issues. And I\u2019ve still got a comedy career, I think. And I don\u2019t think people find me any less funny because of it. And I realise, I\u2019m so bolstered and helped by the men in my life. All the messages, on so many platforms, can be a bit of a punch to the tummy sometimes. But the variety of types of people who write in, like I\u2019m a radio show, absolutely built up my empathy muscle. And it\u2019s allowed me to stop thinking I was the only one with that story\u2026\u201d She is trying very quietly not to cry. \u201cOh, I hate getting all upset. And this is why I wrote the article because I just get wobbly talking about it. Right\u2026\u201d She takes a dramatic breath. \u201cThe true narrative is there are a million different stories, and maybe the one you think is real is not the real story.\u201d Once, she went to see a psychic and was upset when the woman couldn\u2019t get in touch with her dad. \u201cI\u2019m like,\u201d she snickers, \u2018Are you even a real psychic?\u2019 But the psychic replied, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s just that your dad\u2019s death doesn\u2019t define you.\u2019 \u201cWhat if,\u201d Bea thought, then, \u201cI was able to let that go?\u201d Would she still be able to write? She pauses. \u201cThese are all realisations I\u2019m having now I\u2019m in my \u2018white lady expanding\u2019 stage.\u201d She offers me another bad biscuit, which I eat. There is a Whatsapp group that consists of, among others, Lena Dunham, Richard Curtis, and Aisling Bea, where the sole topic of conversation is Love Island. \u201cIT IS A COMPLICATED THING AS A FEMINIST AND PERSON WITH A BRAIN AND I KNOW IT IS TRICKERY, BUT IT IS ALSO ANTHROPOLOGY AND TALES AS OLD AS TIME,\u201d she emails me later, caps lock on. Telly is important to her, in part because of what it reveals about what we need. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised shows like Queer Eye and Marie Kondo are capturing people,\u201d she says, tucking her feet up on to the sofa, \u201cbecause it\u2019s about communal ideas of help, as well as getting rid of your old shoes. Money isn\u2019t going to fill us up so what\u2019s the thing? Each other. And that sounds cutesy-cutesy, but we can feel it on a big level at the moment. If we\u2019re relying on fucking Boris Johnson to fix things for us, that won\u2019t happen in our lifetime. And it\u2019s awful. It\u2019s fucking awful that Help Refugees has to go over to Calais with a lot of fucking comedians. That people have to take it upon themselves to leave food outside Waitrose to help their fellow man because the government isn\u2019t doing anything about it. But the cavalry are not coming.\u201d When she left drama school (after an earlier degree in French and philosophy) she expected to be playing Medea within a week. \u201cBut as Sharon Horgan always says, waiting around for great female parts doesn\u2019t work. So you have to write them. This idea of the giant parental system looking after us just isn\u2019t happening. So in the interim, we\u2019ve got to step up.\u201d I must have narrowed my eyes, preparing to unleash a gob of cynicism, because she leans in: \u201cDemanding more at a small level means that the bigger people start realising there\u2019s a business in that. And we send the message back up the supply chain. Yeah, petitions don\u2019t work when it\u2019s seven of us. But they might work when there are 200,000 of us. That little girl did that.\u201d She\u2019s talking about Greta Thunberg, of course. \u201cWith Repeal there were sweatshirts, with Greta Thunberg there were pigtails!\u201d With Bea, it\u2019s humour. Apart from the earlier biscuit terrorism, it is very difficult to find a single crack to poke criticism into. I continue to try, because journalism. The appeal of Bea and, with This Way Up, the thing that will no doubt propel her from Dave stalwart to artist (much in the way Catastrophe took Horgan\u2019s subversive voice mainstream) is the way she combines her jollity with that forensic exploration of melancholy.

I\u2019ve never seen anything like it on the stage before. The set, the performances, the actors \u2013 it was electrifying.</p> <h2>2.

      "bodyText": "Poet and playwright Inua Ellams was born in Nigeria in 1984 and moved to London with his family as a child. In 2009 his debut play, The 14th Tale, won a Fringe First at the Edinburgh festival. His latest play, The Half God of Rainfall, set between south-west Nigeria and Mount Olympus, opened earlier this year. In 2018, Ellams was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. After two sell-out runs at the National Theatre in London and a world tour, his hit 2017 play, Barber Shop Chronicles, is at the Roundhouse, London, until 24 August. 1. Play Equus at Trafalgar Studios, London I saw this the other week and it was phenomenal. It was written in the 1970s by Peter Shaffer and tells the story of a young man who attacks six horses. I read into it a deep comment about performances of masculinity and the pressures for men to perform sexually and the failings of that. It was a beautiful adaptation: the dancers morph into horses. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it on the stage before. The set, the performances, the actors \u2013 it was electrifying. 2. YouTube Chillhop Music Normally when I write I need dead silence \u2013 anything else crashes in my head. But I\u2019ve been immersing myself in this: they play laid-back hip-hop instrumentals and I just have it looping in the background. It\u2019s almost meditative. It\u2019s mellow, with lots of samples: the drums aren\u2019t too hard, the beat isn\u2019t too hard. It\u2019s sort of like taking a nice jog: when you get into the rhythm of running, it helps you process things. This does that to my mental space: it structures my thoughts, it gives me a safe tapestry to think on top of. 3. Album Dave - Psychodrama I was late to discovering Dave, but this album is magnificent and understated. For a rapper \u2013 who are bastions of black masculinity \u2013 to structure an album around interviews with his therapist was so exposing, honest and true. Dave\u2019s an incredible lyricist and thinker, and the album shines in his brilliance. The fact that his song Black became a Radio 1 hit shows England is now willing to have conversations with itself about racism and the legacy of colonisation, which we weren\u2019t able to have three, five years ago. British citizens are braver than the politicians think we are. 4. Script seven methods of killing kylie jenner I saw the play, but I think people should buy the script and read it like you would a short story. I\u2019ve never seen a script look like this, ever. The book is divided into TL, which stands for timeline, and IRL \u2013 in real life. Half of the play happens on Twitter, and in the script they have the memes printed out and it looks like a Twitter thread. It\u2019s one of the bravest things I\u2019ve ever seen. It was written by Jasmine Lee-Jones and it\u2019s a work of art: subversive, funny, illustrative, powerful and witty as hell. 5. TV Years and Years Oh God, it was perfect: a blend of science fiction, fantasy and political awareness. All the characters were complex as hell and flawed and incredible. I saw a lot of Afrofuturist ground \u2013 writers such as Octavia Butler and Nnedi Okorafor \u2013 covered in the depiction of the girl who was trying to become half AI.

We put that out within 72 hours, under the headline: \u201cBrexit: are we facing the reversal of globalisation?\u201d That edition sold almost 200,000 copies \u2013 even more than our report on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win.</p> <p>Not many Chinese people care about the technical or legal details of the Brexit deal, but the saga has made an impression. The reputation of British democracy has suffered. If you ask someone on the streets of Beijing what they think of Brexit, they might say: \u201cDemocracy only leads to confusion.\u201d I know that\u2019s not true, but it is difficult to change their impression.</p> <p>For the past two or three decades, the US and Britain have been cultural symbols in Chinese people\u2019s eyes: the US powerful, rich, enviable; the UK exquisite, elegant. Public intellectuals, especially liberals, talk about the British style of constitutionalism, comparing it to our Soviet-style totalitarian regime. Students know more about Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher than JFK or Bill Clinton. That is real \u201csoft power\u201d.</p> <p>But now this image has collapsed. In the Brexit farce, there is no Churchill or Thatcher, only a dozen mediocre politicians, none of whom want to take responsibility or unite the nation. This has encouraged the nationalists in China, especially the young generation born after 1989. With the \u201chelp\u201d of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/29/the-great-firewall-of-china-xi-jinpings-internet-shutdown\" title=\"\">great </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/29/the-great-firewall-of-china-xi-jinpings-internet-shutdown\" title=\"\">fire</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/29/the-great-firewall-of-china-xi-jinpings-internet-shutdown\" title=\"\">wall</a>, they knew little about the inner crisis of their own country. But they see that China now has more aircraft carriers, more missiles and more hi-tech fighters, while the UK is trapped in the wallows of Brexit. There is an inner voice in their hearts: \u201cNow we are strong. They are weak. We have nothing to learn from them.\u201d That\u2019s the danger.</p> <p>Today, no one really cares about Boris Johnson, but since he was the one who called for Brexit at the beginning, Chinese people will be interested to see how he can turn his commitment into reality.<br><strong>As told to Lily Kuo</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a6c1d091610dc7040b3d84d4e6be39eb3b757bab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6c1d091610dc7040b3d84d4e6be39eb3b757bab/0_0_1000_927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvie Kauffmann\" width=\"1000\" height=\"927\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>France: \u2018Once, we used to hold up British parliamentary life as the Rolls-Royce of liberal democracy\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Sylvie Kauffmann, editorial director and contributor, Le Monde</em></p> <p>First, I should say that we French Europeans are grateful to our British friends for making sure one word has exited our vocabulary: Frexit.</p> <p>For Brexit has made Frexit impossible. Four years ago, Marine Le Pen could still float the Frexit temptation and lead some of her supporters to believe that leaving the EU would somehow solve France\u2019s problems.</p> <p>By the time she launched her campaign for the 2017 presidential election, the Brexit referendum had already had one effect: the Front National leader no longer dared push her Frexit argument any more, confining herself instead to attacking the euro and advocating a return to the old franc. Even this proved a bad idea.</p> <p>In the last TV debate between the two rounds of the election, Emmanuel Macron crushed Le Pen by proving how incoherent her idea of a French paradise outside the eurozone actually was. It took a year for her to recover, and two years for her party \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/marine-le-pen-rebrands-front-national-in-push-for-support\" title=\"\">now renamed National Rally</a> \u2013 to produce a programme admitting that leaving the euro was \u201cnot a priority any more\u201d.</p> <p>But for us, this has been the only silver lining of the Brexit saga. Watching the long descent of Westminster into something resembling hell has been an exhausting experience. Theresa May\u2019s very British resilience was impressive, but we ended up pitying her. Nigel Farage\u2019s type was all too familiar to us: we well understood just how dangerous he was. Some of us once found Boris Johnson funny; we long ago stopped laughing. John Bercow\u2019s ties and desperate calls for order made a good show, but on the whole, this was a cast with too many villains and too few heroes.</p> <p>Once, we used to hold up British parliamentary life as an example, and watch prime minister\u2019s questions in the House of Commons with envy: for us, accustomed to semi-monarchical presidents of the Republic, this was the very Rolls-Royce of liberal democracy. Now that Rolls-Royce looks more like a dodgem.</p> <p>We have come to dread seeing old British friends, now so obsessed with Brexit that it is all but impossible to talk of anything else. We wondered how it was possible for such brilliant public servants and such a legendary diplomatic service to be unable to come up with better plans and bring them to the negotiating table.</p> <p>And we could not understand how a former empire could dream of becoming \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d. All our myths, in short, have been destroyed. Instead of taking back control, the Brits seemed to be losing their minds.</p> <p>Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/who-are-the-gilets-jaunes-and-what-do-they-want\" title=\"\">France had its own crisis</a>: the <em>gilets jaunes</em>. It was violent, ugly, destabilising. Maybe Brexit was Britain\u2019s <em>gilets jaunes</em> moment? The UK version of a widespread crisis of representative democracy? Less violent \u2013 but, in the end, more destructive.</p> <p>Watching this final episode, of the election of a prime minister by 0.2% of the population, many of us came to this conclusion: this is a British crisis, not a European one. And you will never solve it without leaving, one way or another. So please, go now. Check the freezing temperature outside, fix your problem. And then come back. The door will stay open, because we do want you back.

Quoting witty lines in Latin won\u2019t change that\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Khu\u00ea Pham, </em><em>staff writer, Zeit magazine</em></p> <p>It has been difficult to write with the eye of a neutral observer about an event, Brexit, that can feel like a personal affront. After Berlin, London was my second home town, a place where I had gone to university and lived for four years. Yet the vote to leave made me realise that perhaps there was a side to Britain I had overlooked.</p> <p>I learned a lot since then \u2013 not just about Britain, but also our blindspots as reporters. I saw parallels to Brexit not just in Donald Trump\u2019s election victory later that year, but also in the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alternative-fur-deutschland-afd\" title=\"\">Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland</a> at the 2017 elections in Germany. All three raise questions of social inequality that we have failed to address until now. The problem is that we are still looking for ways to resolve them. People are more disillusioned about politics than ever, and yet we are nowhere nearer to cleaning up the mess.</p> <p>For our readers at <em>Die Zeit</em>, Boris Johnson is by far the most intriguing character in the Brexit drama. He makes them come out in a rash \u2013 it\u2019s as if they are allergic to him. They feel he has been disdainful towards Europeans, treating Europe as a big joke. That view will stick around even as prime minister \u2013 quoting witty lines in Latin won\u2019t change that.</p> <p>I wrote a profile of him during the referendum campaign, and the impression I had then was of someone who doesn\u2019t actually have a very strong opinion on Europe at all, and who isn\u2019t really interested in the detail part of politics, which requires hard work. His stint as foreign secretary only confirmed that, so I am really surprised how many British commentators now endorse him as a prime minister.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s soft power has already started to diminish. Caught up in Brexit, the UK government doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth to play a role in European politics any more. I think the German public has started to lose interest in the latest details of the negotiations \u2013 they used to think of Britain as being very cool, now it\u2019s seen as a big mess.</p> <p>I am not very hopeful about good relations between Britain and Germany in the near future. Merkel is on her way out and there\u2019s no strong candidate to succeed her. The danger is that in a year\u2019s time both Britain and Germany could be in a volatile state, both with leaders who need to prove to the electorate that they can be tough in negotiations. I fear the UK will come to miss Merkel as a pillar of stability.<br><strong>As told to Philip Oltermann</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"849d662ee6d0a5e8ee1c815ce64ade33786d0b88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/849d662ee6d0a5e8ee1c815ce64ade33786d0b88/0_0_770_775/497.jpg\" alt=\"Nobuyuki Suzuki of Tokyo Shimbum\" width=\"497\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Japan: \u2018The Japanese have always seen Britain as a gentle, stable country, but that has changed\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Nobuyuki Suzuki, media and entertainment news editor, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper</em></p> <p>I\u2019m very concerned about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. This is unprecedented. I\u2019m afraid that Japanese companies will continue to rethink their investments in Britain, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/11/no-deal-brexit-could-cost-japanese-auto-makers-in-uk-1bn-a-year\" title=\"\">Nissan and Honda have already done</a>.</p> <p>Japanese companies invested in Britain because it was a member of the EU. But agreeing a Japan-UK free trade deal after Brexit would take a very long time, and during that period it would be difficult for Japanese firms to continue operating in Britain.</p> <p>With or without a deal, leaving the EU is a bad idea and I hope, somehow, that Brexit won\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think David Cameron ever thought that Britain would vote to leave, but voters were influenced by fake news claims about membership of the EU and what leaving would mean. They were persuaded that Brexit would be easy.</p> <p>I feel very sorry for British voters. A lot of people who voted to leave saw themselves as victims of globalisation. If I was a British factory worker and I had lost my job, I would have been tempted to support leaving the EU. The gap between rich and poor was growing. Immigration was also an issue. People looked around and thought: \u201cI want to go back to the way Britain was.\u201d I don\u2019t think voters were given enough information about what the issues were before the referendum, and there should have been much more discussion of the risks and benefits of leaving.</p> <p>The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is considering calling for a referendum on revising Japan\u2019s postwar constitution (to legally recognise the self-defence forces, Japan\u2019s de facto military). If Brexit has taught us anything, it is that the media have to do more to ensure that the public has a proper grasp of both sides of the argument.</p> <p>We run a lot of Brexit stories in the <em>Tokyo Shimbun</em>. It\u2019s one of the hottest foreign news stories around. The tone of our coverage is almost always downbeat and we talk a lot about how chaotic British politics has become.</p> <p>The Japanese have always seen Britain as a gentle, stable country, but that has changed, first because of Brexit and now because of the rise of Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Johnson doesn\u2019t fit the stereotype of an English gentleman. He reminds a lot of people in Japan of Donald Trump, both physically and in terms of his political style.</p> <p>Johnson looks a little wild, and he speaks his mind. We don\u2019t have politicians like that in Japan. What he says about politics doesn\u2019t really matter to the Japanese\u2026 instead we are intrigued by the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak or behave like a conventional politician.<br><strong>As told to Justin McCurry</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a3b28cda164ac03d7b701bbd1a73dca60320dd68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3b28cda164ac03d7b701bbd1a73dca60320dd68/0_100_898_858/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mihir Sharma\" width=\"500\" height=\"478\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>India: \u2018If Britain wants a deal with India, it will have to relax immigration.

I was surprised but not shocked at the result. The Westminster system, which we share, is meant to conceal the real \u201cwill of the people\u201d. It\u2019s a bad idea to combine that with referendums. You might discover what people actually want, which is usually something politicians, and reality, can\u2019t deliver.</p> <p>The result, observing the saga unfold from afar, is high comedy: a political class that is trapped by its own promises and lies into delivering the undeliverable and which is now losing all credibility as a consequence. It\u2019s been strange to watch the incredible arrogance on display in England (not Britain), which reveals itself in this belief that they will somehow be a desirable location or partner for other countries once they leave Europe. </p> <p>Such a giant and inexplicable act of self-harm would be sad if it happened to a country less sure of itself, but when it happens to England, it is amusing as well.</p> <p>Britain confuses its standing with that of London. London is a great global city. Britain is a small European country with ideas above its station. People will continue to shop in London. Companies will locate less in Britain. The Indian government will pay less attention to the British prime minister and more to Brussels and Berlin.</p> <p>It seems to me that too many people in London seem to believe, deep down, that Brexit won\u2019t happen.

For one, I see it as a warning of the danger in allowing a single issue to take over all politics, all economic planning, and in fact all conversation. Brexit has dumbed Britain down.</p> <p>For another, politicians need to realise that in democracies like Britain or India, people are always angry: whether at austerity, or decreasing living standards, or immigration, or religious diversity. Anger just needs a target. The Brexit referendum gave them one: the EU. The country that invented the Westminster system, intended to control popular anger, seems to have forgotten how to run a democracy.</p> <p>India, like others, has noticed for the first time that Europe exists independently of Britain. India thought of Europe as Britain\u2019s backyard. Brexit means we will now develop independent relationships with European countries. Britain, and London, will become less important.</p> <p>If Brexiters think that negotiating a trade agreement with India is going to be easy, they are in for a nasty shock. There is a far stronger belief in Britain than in India in the power of nostalgia and a \u201cshared history\u201d. It won\u2019t impact trade negotiations at all. If Britain wants a deal, it will have to concede India\u2019s demand for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/24/ease-migration-rules-for-indians-to-win-post-brexit-deals-say-mps\" title=\"\">easier work visas for professionals and students</a>. It will have to relax immigration. This is as non-negotiable for New Delhi as it is for Brussels. I\u2019m sure Brexiters will be fine with that!</p> <p>Britain\u2019s reputation for common sense and pragmatism has been severely damaged by Brexit.

There\u2019s some interest in the political spectacle, but the importance of Great Britain in the consciousness of South Africa has waned. Yet there\u2019s a gleefulness in watching the British realise the ineptitude of their own politicians. I guess we suffered when they were colonial rulers, and Boris Johnson [encapsulates] everything you might lampoon about Britain and its idea of itself.</p> <p>In South Africa we have problems with our own politicians, and it is almost consoling to see that we are not alone. Britain is trying to figure itself out in 2019 and is suddenly realising that it\u2019s not that important any more. </p> <p>Britain has come to think of itself in very noble terms, and to do that it has had to fundamentally erase its dealings with the colonies. Its history has been written that way. I am a fourth-generation South African of Indian descent, so my own history is riddled with Britain\u2019s colonialism, and all that is glossed over.</p> <p>Of course we were surprised by the referendum result, but when you zoom out a bit it all makes sense.

We get that the drama is related. No one thought Britain would vote to leave the EU, until it did. No one thought Trump would win the presidency, until he did.</p> <p>What happened in the UK in June 2016 later looked like the harbinger of America\u2019s political upheaval. Or maybe it felt more soothing that way. Here, America may not have wanted to be first.</p> <p>If the comparisons between Trump and Brexit seemed straightforward \u2013 the rise of populism and rightwing nationalism; the distrust of institutions and the \u201celite\u201d \u2013 it became clear the events connected in deeper, murkier ways. Misinformation became a feature of both the referendum and the presidential campaign: the UK had the Brexit bus, the US had (well, still has) Trump\u2019s twitter feed. Fake news was amplified on social media, including by Russian trolls. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carolecadwalladr\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica</a> appeared as a villain in both. So, somehow, did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/22/video-reveals-steve-bannon-links-to-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Steve Bannon</a>.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s ascension to prime minister feels a bit like we still don\u2019t get it, that all the forces that made Trump and Brexit possible have only hardened in the three years since. Johnson, Americans know, is the guy that sold Brexit, and Brexit really has not gone well. But his party, at least, is buying into his vision, even doubling down on it. It puts a knot in our stomach about 2020.</p> <p>Johnson isn\u2019t exactly \u201cBritain\u2019s Trump\u201d. Their commonalities are mostly superficial: born in New York, both have populist appeal despite a privileged upbringing; both court controversy and are owners of questionable hairstyles. But Johnson appears more savvy, more shrewd, more deliberate. He\u2019s Trump, if Trump were in on the joke.</p> <p>The end result might be the same for both nations: leaders who cater to the voters who buy into their rhetoric, leaving everyone else to condemn their lies. Two men who should be cast off as ridiculous were they not so capable of tapping into anger, resentment, racism.</p> <p>Johnson and Trump will meet as heads of state at the G7 later this month, and the next, weirder stage of the special relationship will begin. It could be short-lived. Trump\u2019s presidency has strained democratic alliances, and amplified some uncomfortable bonds, from Jair Bolsonaro to Mohammad bin Salman. But the US under Trump doesn\u2019t look as desperate for friends as the UK does in its breakup with the EU. The Brexiters seem to think that the US will be a better substitute for the EU. But Trump can\u2019t be trusted, particularly not on trade, where his one organising principle is that everyone\u2019s out to take advantage of the US. And even if Trump gets along with Johnson now, he might be looking over his shoulder for someone better, or, really, just Nigel Farage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5f82a61e7da5b34c3b67b26ab8bd00528be16bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f82a61e7da5b34c3b67b26ab8bd00528be16bb4/0_0_800_723/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fernanda Mena, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Brazil: \u2018The UK appears fixated on its own problems \u2013 it is losing relevance quite quickly\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Fernanda Mena, columnist, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo</em></p> <p>Many of my peers, upper-middle-class Paulistas, are anglophiles, people who appreciate Britain as the homeland of ideas of liberalism, free markets and multiculturalism \u2013 all reinforced by the soft power of British pop culture. We have always seen London as one of the capitals of the world \u2013 very cosmopolitan and full of youth culture.</p> <p>And as Brazilians we know that Brits in general are better educated than us. So it was quite shocking to see people being driven by lies to vote for Brexit \u2013 and betraying all those principles of multiculturalism, liberalism and free markets.</p> <p>I was incredulous when I heard the result, but looking back at the time I spent studying in London, there were one or two things that could have given me a sign of what was to come.

      "bodyText": "China: \u2018The Brexit farce has encouraged the nationalists in China, especially the young generation\u2019 Liu Ye, editor of international affairs at Sanlian Life Week magazine in Beijing I remember the day of the referendum. It was very hot in Beijing that morning and I had gone to a meeting with my publishing agent. I kept checking the BBC app on my phone for news. Finally, after leaving the meeting, while waiting for a taxi, my phone buzzed \u2013 the UK had chosen to leave. Suddenly I was reminded of an old Yugoslav film, Walter Defends Sarajevo, which was very popular in China in the 1970s. There is a famous line that many Chinese people will remember: \u201cThe air is shaking, as if the sky is going to burn. The storm is coming.\u201d Within a few hours, I published an article titled \u201cThe storm is coming\u201d. It was read by more than 100,000 people in just one hour. Later, I persuaded my editor to do a cover story on Brexit. We put that out within 72 hours, under the headline: \u201cBrexit: are we facing the reversal of globalisation?\u201d That edition sold almost 200,000 copies \u2013 even more than our report on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win. Not many Chinese people care about the technical or legal details of the Brexit deal, but the saga has made an impression. The reputation of British democracy has suffered. If you ask someone on the streets of Beijing what they think of Brexit, they might say: \u201cDemocracy only leads to confusion.\u201d I know that\u2019s not true, but it is difficult to change their impression. For the past two or three decades, the US and Britain have been cultural symbols in Chinese people\u2019s eyes: the US powerful, rich, enviable; the UK exquisite, elegant. Public intellectuals, especially liberals, talk about the British style of constitutionalism, comparing it to our Soviet-style totalitarian regime. Students know more about Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher than JFK or Bill Clinton. That is real \u201csoft power\u201d. But now this image has collapsed. In the Brexit farce, there is no Churchill or Thatcher, only a dozen mediocre politicians, none of whom want to take responsibility or unite the nation. This has encouraged the nationalists in China, especially the young generation born after 1989. With the \u201chelp\u201d of the great firewall, they knew little about the inner crisis of their own country. But they see that China now has more aircraft carriers, more missiles and more hi-tech fighters, while the UK is trapped in the wallows of Brexit. There is an inner voice in their hearts: \u201cNow we are strong. They are weak. We have nothing to learn from them.\u201d That\u2019s the danger. Today, no one really cares about Boris Johnson, but since he was the one who called for Brexit at the beginning, Chinese people will be interested to see how he can turn his commitment into reality. As told to Lily Kuo France: \u2018Once, we used to hold up British parliamentary life as the Rolls-Royce of liberal democracy\u2019 Sylvie Kauffmann, editorial director and contributor, Le Monde First, I should say that we French Europeans are grateful to our British friends for making sure one word has exited our vocabulary: Frexit. For Brexit has made Frexit impossible. Four years ago, Marine Le Pen could still float the Frexit temptation and lead some of her supporters to believe that leaving the EU would somehow solve France\u2019s problems. By the time she launched her campaign for the 2017 presidential election, the Brexit referendum had already had one effect: the Front National leader no longer dared push her Frexit argument any more, confining herself instead to attacking the euro and advocating a return to the old franc. Even this proved a bad idea. In the last TV debate between the two rounds of the election, Emmanuel Macron crushed Le Pen by proving how incoherent her idea of a French paradise outside the eurozone actually was. It took a year for her to recover, and two years for her party \u2013 now renamed National Rally \u2013 to produce a programme admitting that leaving the euro was \u201cnot a priority any more\u201d. But for us, this has been the only silver lining of the Brexit saga. Watching the long descent of Westminster into something resembling hell has been an exhausting experience. Theresa May\u2019s very British resilience was impressive, but we ended up pitying her. Nigel Farage\u2019s type was all too familiar to us: we well understood just how dangerous he was. Some of us once found Boris Johnson funny; we long ago stopped laughing. John Bercow\u2019s ties and desperate calls for order made a good show, but on the whole, this was a cast with too many villains and too few heroes. Once, we used to hold up British parliamentary life as an example, and watch prime minister\u2019s questions in the House of Commons with envy: for us, accustomed to semi-monarchical presidents of the Republic, this was the very Rolls-Royce of liberal democracy. Now that Rolls-Royce looks more like a dodgem. We have come to dread seeing old British friends, now so obsessed with Brexit that it is all but impossible to talk of anything else. We wondered how it was possible for such brilliant public servants and such a legendary diplomatic service to be unable to come up with better plans and bring them to the negotiating table. And we could not understand how a former empire could dream of becoming \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d. All our myths, in short, have been destroyed. Instead of taking back control, the Brits seemed to be losing their minds. Then France had its own crisis: the gilets jaunes. It was violent, ugly, destabilising. Maybe Brexit was Britain\u2019s gilets jaunes moment? The UK version of a widespread crisis of representative democracy? Less violent \u2013 but, in the end, more destructive. Watching this final episode, of the election of a prime minister by 0.2% of the population, many of us came to this conclusion: this is a British crisis, not a European one. And you will never solve it without leaving, one way or another. So please, go now. Check the freezing temperature outside, fix your problem. And then come back. The door will stay open, because we do want you back. Just calmed down a bit. As told to Jon Henley Germany: \u2018Johnson is seen as treating Europe as a big joke. Quoting witty lines in Latin won\u2019t change that\u2019 Khu\u00ea Pham, staff writer, Zeit magazine It has been difficult to write with the eye of a neutral observer about an event, Brexit, that can feel like a personal affront. After Berlin, London was my second home town, a place where I had gone to university and lived for four years. Yet the vote to leave made me realise that perhaps there was a side to Britain I had overlooked. I learned a lot since then \u2013 not just about Britain, but also our blindspots as reporters. I saw parallels to Brexit not just in Donald Trump\u2019s election victory later that year, but also in the rise of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland at the 2017 elections in Germany. All three raise questions of social inequality that we have failed to address until now. The problem is that we are still looking for ways to resolve them. People are more disillusioned about politics than ever, and yet we are nowhere nearer to cleaning up the mess. For our readers at Die Zeit, Boris Johnson is by far the most intriguing character in the Brexit drama. He makes them come out in a rash \u2013 it\u2019s as if they are allergic to him. They feel he has been disdainful towards Europeans, treating Europe as a big joke. That view will stick around even as prime minister \u2013 quoting witty lines in Latin won\u2019t change that. I wrote a profile of him during the referendum campaign, and the impression I had then was of someone who doesn\u2019t actually have a very strong opinion on Europe at all, and who isn\u2019t really interested in the detail part of politics, which requires hard work. His stint as foreign secretary only confirmed that, so I am really surprised how many British commentators now endorse him as a prime minister. Britain\u2019s soft power has already started to diminish. Caught up in Brexit, the UK government doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth to play a role in European politics any more. I think the German public has started to lose interest in the latest details of the negotiations \u2013 they used to think of Britain as being very cool, now it\u2019s seen as a big mess. I am not very hopeful about good relations between Britain and Germany in the near future. Merkel is on her way out and there\u2019s no strong candidate to succeed her. The danger is that in a year\u2019s time both Britain and Germany could be in a volatile state, both with leaders who need to prove to the electorate that they can be tough in negotiations. I fear the UK will come to miss Merkel as a pillar of stability. As told to Philip Oltermann Japan: \u2018The Japanese have always seen Britain as a gentle, stable country, but that has changed\u2019 Nobuyuki Suzuki, media and entertainment news editor, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper I\u2019m very concerned about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. This is unprecedented. I\u2019m afraid that Japanese companies will continue to rethink their investments in Britain, as Nissan and Honda have already done. Japanese companies invested in Britain because it was a member of the EU. But agreeing a Japan-UK free trade deal after Brexit would take a very long time, and during that period it would be difficult for Japanese firms to continue operating in Britain. With or without a deal, leaving the EU is a bad idea and I hope, somehow, that Brexit won\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think David Cameron ever thought that Britain would vote to leave, but voters were influenced by fake news claims about membership of the EU and what leaving would mean. They were persuaded that Brexit would be easy. I feel very sorry for British voters. A lot of people who voted to leave saw themselves as victims of globalisation. If I was a British factory worker and I had lost my job, I would have been tempted to support leaving the EU. The gap between rich and poor was growing. Immigration was also an issue. People looked around and thought: \u201cI want to go back to the way Britain was.\u201d I don\u2019t think voters were given enough information about what the issues were before the referendum, and there should have been much more discussion of the risks and benefits of leaving. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is considering calling for a referendum on revising Japan\u2019s postwar constitution (to legally recognise the self-defence forces, Japan\u2019s de facto military). If Brexit has taught us anything, it is that the media have to do more to ensure that the public has a proper grasp of both sides of the argument. We run a lot of Brexit stories in the Tokyo Shimbun. It\u2019s one of the hottest foreign news stories around. The tone of our coverage is almost always downbeat and we talk a lot about how chaotic British politics has become. The Japanese have always seen Britain as a gentle, stable country, but that has changed, first because of Brexit and now because of the rise of Boris Johnson. Johnson doesn\u2019t fit the stereotype of an English gentleman. He reminds a lot of people in Japan of Donald Trump, both physically and in terms of his political style. Johnson looks a little wild, and he speaks his mind. We don\u2019t have politicians like that in Japan. What he says about politics doesn\u2019t really matter to the Japanese\u2026 instead we are intrigued by the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak or behave like a conventional politician. As told to Justin McCurry India: \u2018If Britain wants a deal with India, it will have to relax immigration. This is non-negotiable\u2019 Mihir Sharma, author, Bloomberg columnist, and senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi I visit the UK regularly and was there during the referendum. I was surprised but not shocked at the result. The Westminster system, which we share, is meant to conceal the real \u201cwill of the people\u201d. It\u2019s a bad idea to combine that with referendums. You might discover what people actually want, which is usually something politicians, and reality, can\u2019t deliver. The result, observing the saga unfold from afar, is high comedy: a political class that is trapped by its own promises and lies into delivering the undeliverable and which is now losing all credibility as a consequence. It\u2019s been strange to watch the incredible arrogance on display in England (not Britain), which reveals itself in this belief that they will somehow be a desirable location or partner for other countries once they leave Europe. Such a giant and inexplicable act of self-harm would be sad if it happened to a country less sure of itself, but when it happens to England, it is amusing as well. Britain confuses its standing with that of London. London is a great global city. Britain is a small European country with ideas above its station. People will continue to shop in London. Companies will locate less in Britain. The Indian government will pay less attention to the British prime minister and more to Brussels and Berlin. It seems to me that too many people in London seem to believe, deep down, that Brexit won\u2019t happen. They don\u2019t seem to realise they are now strangers in their own country. As a political analyst, I have learned quite a few things from Brexit. For one, I see it as a warning of the danger in allowing a single issue to take over all politics, all economic planning, and in fact all conversation. Brexit has dumbed Britain down. For another, politicians need to realise that in democracies like Britain or India, people are always angry: whether at austerity, or decreasing living standards, or immigration, or religious diversity. Anger just needs a target. The Brexit referendum gave them one: the EU. The country that invented the Westminster system, intended to control popular anger, seems to have forgotten how to run a democracy. India, like others, has noticed for the first time that Europe exists independently of Britain. India thought of Europe as Britain\u2019s backyard. Brexit means we will now develop independent relationships with European countries. Britain, and London, will become less important. If Brexiters think that negotiating a trade agreement with India is going to be easy, they are in for a nasty shock. There is a far stronger belief in Britain than in India in the power of nostalgia and a \u201cshared history\u201d. It won\u2019t impact trade negotiations at all. If Britain wants a deal, it will have to concede India\u2019s demand for easier work visas for professionals and students. It will have to relax immigration. This is as non-negotiable for New Delhi as it is for Brussels. I\u2019m sure Brexiters will be fine with that! Britain\u2019s reputation for common sense and pragmatism has been severely damaged by Brexit. I doubt it will survive a Boris Johnson premiership. As told to Amrit Dhillon South Africa: \u2018There\u2019s a gleefulness in watching the British realise the ineptitude of their own politicians\u2019 Khadija Patel, editor-in-chief, the Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper, Johannesburg People find Brexit inexplicable and are getting bored by it. There\u2019s some interest in the political spectacle, but the importance of Great Britain in the consciousness of South Africa has waned. Yet there\u2019s a gleefulness in watching the British realise the ineptitude of their own politicians. I guess we suffered when they were colonial rulers, and Boris Johnson [encapsulates] everything you might lampoon about Britain and its idea of itself. In South Africa we have problems with our own politicians, and it is almost consoling to see that we are not alone. Britain is trying to figure itself out in 2019 and is suddenly realising that it\u2019s not that important any more. Britain has come to think of itself in very noble terms, and to do that it has had to fundamentally erase its dealings with the colonies. Its history has been written that way. I am a fourth-generation South African of Indian descent, so my own history is riddled with Britain\u2019s colonialism, and all that is glossed over. Of course we were surprised by the referendum result, but when you zoom out a bit it all makes sense. We have seen similar shocks elsewhere \u2013 Trump, Modi in India, Bolsonaro in Brazil and so on. The global trend towards populism is scary. It fundamentally undermines democracy. I\u2019m going to be interested in how Boris Johnson deals with Africa\u2026 I don\u2019t think that [South African president] Cyril Ramaphosa or [foreign minister] Naledi Pandor are going to respond very well to him as a serious interlocutor with proposals about strengthening ties between our two countries. Britain will never hold that soft power again, no way. As told to Jason Burke Russia: \u2018Our leaders see Boris Johnson as temporary \u2013 a clown. They\u2019ll wait for the new leader\u2019 Alexey Venediktov, editor-in-chief, Echo of Moscow radio station The economic leadership of Russia is not happy [about Brexit]. They think turbulence is not in our interest because Russia has a fairly weak economy at the moment. It changes the rules now, while we are weak. They\u2019re concerned about the future. But the political leadership see a united front of western countries against them, and they see any weakening \u2013 the separatist movement in Catalonia, the rise of Salvini in Italy, the growth of the far right in the Netherlands and Germany, the exit of the UK from the EU \u2013 as a positive, because it makes our opponents look at themselves, not at us. I don\u2019t see a possibility [for relations to improve]. The bilateral relationship isn\u2019t determined by whether or not the UK is in the EU. Our relations of late have largely been determined by the Skripal case, and the British leadership is now seen as the most actively hostile European government to Russia. [Of greater importance to diplomacy is] Vladimir Putin\u2019s personal relationship with a leader, as we saw with George W Bush. Despite political differences, they had [a rapport] that helped smooth over many of the problems between Russia and the US. Unfortunately, the view of Boris Johnson in the leadership is quite negative. They don\u2019t think he is serious. They think he\u2019s a clown. And second, they think he has little support in his party and his country. So he\u2019s temporary\u2026 we\u2019ll wait for the new leader. As told to Andrew Roth The United States: \u2018Trump\u2019s US doesn\u2019t look as desperate for friends as the UK does in its split from the EU\u2019 Jen Kirby, foreign and national security reporter, Vox Brexit, and the rise of Boris Johnson, is a drama Americans know they\u2019re supposed to pay attention to, if only we weren\u2019t so consumed by our own. We get that the drama is related. No one thought Britain would vote to leave the EU, until it did. No one thought Trump would win the presidency, until he did. What happened in the UK in June 2016 later looked like the harbinger of America\u2019s political upheaval. Or maybe it felt more soothing that way. Here, America may not have wanted to be first. If the comparisons between Trump and Brexit seemed straightforward \u2013 the rise of populism and rightwing nationalism; the distrust of institutions and the \u201celite\u201d \u2013 it became clear the events connected in deeper, murkier ways. Misinformation became a feature of both the referendum and the presidential campaign: the UK had the Brexit bus, the US had (well, still has) Trump\u2019s twitter feed. Fake news was amplified on social media, including by Russian trolls. Cambridge Analytica appeared as a villain in both. So, somehow, did Steve Bannon. Johnson\u2019s ascension to prime minister feels a bit like we still don\u2019t get it, that all the forces that made Trump and Brexit possible have only hardened in the three years since. Johnson, Americans know, is the guy that sold Brexit, and Brexit really has not gone well. But his party, at least, is buying into his vision, even doubling down on it. It puts a knot in our stomach about 2020. Johnson isn\u2019t exactly \u201cBritain\u2019s Trump\u201d. Their commonalities are mostly superficial: born in New York, both have populist appeal despite a privileged upbringing; both court controversy and are owners of questionable hairstyles. But Johnson appears more savvy, more shrewd, more deliberate. He\u2019s Trump, if Trump were in on the joke. The end result might be the same for both nations: leaders who cater to the voters who buy into their rhetoric, leaving everyone else to condemn their lies. Two men who should be cast off as ridiculous were they not so capable of tapping into anger, resentment, racism. Johnson and Trump will meet as heads of state at the G7 later this month, and the next, weirder stage of the special relationship will begin. It could be short-lived. Trump\u2019s presidency has strained democratic alliances, and amplified some uncomfortable bonds, from Jair Bolsonaro to Mohammad bin Salman. But the US under Trump doesn\u2019t look as desperate for friends as the UK does in its breakup with the EU. The Brexiters seem to think that the US will be a better substitute for the EU. But Trump can\u2019t be trusted, particularly not on trade, where his one organising principle is that everyone\u2019s out to take advantage of the US. And even if Trump gets along with Johnson now, he might be looking over his shoulder for someone better, or, really, just Nigel Farage. Brazil: \u2018The UK appears fixated on its own problems \u2013 it is losing relevance quite quickly\u2019 Fernanda Mena, columnist, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo Many of my peers, upper-middle-class Paulistas, are anglophiles, people who appreciate Britain as the homeland of ideas of liberalism, free markets and multiculturalism \u2013 all reinforced by the soft power of British pop culture. We have always seen London as one of the capitals of the world \u2013 very cosmopolitan and full of youth culture. And as Brazilians we know that Brits in general are better educated than us. So it was quite shocking to see people being driven by lies to vote for Brexit \u2013 and betraying all those principles of multiculturalism, liberalism and free markets. I was incredulous when I heard the result, but looking back at the time I spent studying in London, there were one or two things that could have given me a sign of what was to come. For example, the scandal that broke in 2009 about Primark paying very low wages to Manchester textile workers \u2013 we never thought of the British working-class as being as exploited as workers in eastern Asia. And of course this has to do with globalisation. A link between Brexit and Brazil is the use of social media to target uncertain and vulnerable voters with fake news. It happened here in Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s election \u2013 and maybe it is not a coincidence that Bolsonaro is close to Steve Bannon, who was key in Trump\u2019s election. It looked mad that Britain wanted to leave the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. In June, Brazil, as part of the Mercosur economic area, signed a major trade deal with the EU, so I think the relationship we have with the UK will be much weaker. My impression with Brexit is that a lot of companies will leave the UK. The UK is still the fifth-largest economy but for how much longer? It appears so self-centred, fixated on its own problems that it is currently out of the global debate \u2013 it is losing relevance quite quickly. As told to Ian Tucker",

      "body": "<p>As usual we\u2019re running late. Our three children help rush us down to the bus stop. They\u2019re 24, 22 and 17, but it\u2019s hard to remember that they\u2019re not-kids-any-more. They bundle us on to the bus along with our suitcases and then wave and smile as if sending us off on some epic journey (we\u2019re only flying to Rome). We wave back and then sit down next to a young French mother who has been watching the scene unfold. She laughs enviously and then says: \u201cIt is <em>unimaginable</em>!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s unimaginable for us, too. For the first time in 24 years we are going on holiday without our children. We\u2019ve spent the past decades building sandcastles, eating ice-cream and going on slo-mo treks on dozy ponies. They\u2019ve been among the happiest and best holidays you could imagine, but it\u2019s time for us to learn to be grown-ups again. And a ground-breaking trip like this shouldn\u2019t be undertaken alone, so we round up our oldest friends, the ones we <em>used</em> to go on holiday with. Would they like to come on a child-free break? YES! Would they like some time to think about that?

      "bodyText": "As usual we\u2019re running late. Our three children help rush us down to the bus stop. They\u2019re 24, 22 and 17, but it\u2019s hard to remember that they\u2019re not-kids-any-more. They bundle us on to the bus along with our suitcases and then wave and smile as if sending us off on some epic journey (we\u2019re only flying to Rome). We wave back and then sit down next to a young French mother who has been watching the scene unfold. She laughs enviously and then says: \u201cIt is unimaginable!\u201d It\u2019s unimaginable for us, too. For the first time in 24 years we are going on holiday without our children. We\u2019ve spent the past decades building sandcastles, eating ice-cream and going on slo-mo treks on dozy ponies. They\u2019ve been among the happiest and best holidays you could imagine, but it\u2019s time for us to learn to be grown-ups again. And a ground-breaking trip like this shouldn\u2019t be undertaken alone, so we round up our oldest friends, the ones we used to go on holiday with. Would they like to come on a child-free break? YES! Would they like some time to think about that? NO! We decide on Italy; in particular, an Umbrian villa called Casa dei Falchi in the wooded hills above Citt\u00e0 di Castello.

      "bodyText": "With just the Lions vs Bulldogs contest the only fixture remaining in play I think it\u2019s about time I took my leave for the afternoon. Don\u2019t forget to join the Ashes liveblog which will be underway in an hour or so to kick off what promises to be a thrilling day of Test cricket. As always, thank you for your company. I\u2019ll see you again here soon. The Eels secure the two points with a workmanlike performance away to the Dragons. Despite the win Parramatta remain sixth on the ladder but now with a four point buffer to the chasing pack in the race for the finals. Eight wins out of eight in Melbourne for the Eagles and they\u2019re going to be hard to stop in their quest for both the minor premiership and the flag. It was a strong all-round team performance, topped by Liam Ryan\u2019s four goal haul. Despite the defeat it was another encouraging performance from David Teague\u2019s Blues but Carlton were powerless to withstand the second quarter barrage that decided the contest. AFL: HT: Brisbane 7.7 (49) v Western Bulldogs 2.8 (20) - The Lions remain on course for the four points at home to the Bulldogs with a handy 29-point lead at half-time. Mitch Robinson has the Gabba crowd in the palm of his hand. He\u2019s kicked a couple in an all-action display topped by a bulldozing contested mark and goal right on the siren. AFL: 3QT: Carlton 8.6 (54) v West Coast 14.7 (91) - The Eagles have extended their advantage over a willing Carlton at Marvel Stadium and look destined to be one of three sides sharing 56 points on the top of the ladder by the day\u2019s end. Liam Ryan has four goals for the 2018 champions as they reassert their premiership credentials. AFL: QT: Brisbane 4.3 (27) v Western Bulldogs 0.5 (5) - The Lions bandwagon rolls on apace with Brisbane ripping through the Bulldogs in the opening quarter at the Gabba. If they see the job through they will end the round just percentage away from the top of the ladder. AFL: Underway in the final AFL contest of the round, and the Lions are off to a fast start against the Bulldogs. NRL: HT: Dragons 0-10 Eels - Tries to Maika Sivo and Dylan Brown have given the Eels a handy lead at half-time away to the Dragons. What a finish in Adelaide! The Magpies claimed the last three bonus points but it still wasn\u2019t enough to overhaul the four-point deficit from the opening quarter and they have to settle for a draw against the Thunderbirds. The result eases Adelaide away from the Firebirds on the foot of the ladder but hampers Collingwood\u2019s chances of catching the Giants in the race for the finals with just three rounds remaining. Super Netball: 3QT: Thunderbirds 34-32 Magpies - A second bonus point for the Magpies away to the Thunderbirds and they are not giving up this contest without a fight. With the Giants prevailing earlier in the day this has become a must-win fixture for Collingwood and after a slow start they are growing into their work nicely. It\u2019s a pretty even stats sheet aside from the penalty count with the visitors conceding a whopping 49 compared to their hosts\u2019 35. AFL: HT: Carlton 6.3 (39) v West Coast 9.5 (59) - This is a super game of footy between two in-form teams at Marvel Stadium, and at the main break the Eagles have forced their way into the lead. In the second quarter they pummelled the scoreboard in a run that included seven goals from ten entires inside-50. Liam Ryan typified that attacking quality, kicking a major after holding onto one of the marks of the season, running into traffic following the flight of the ball. NRL: The final fixture of the afternoon in the NRL is underway with the Eels looking to advance their standing among the finals contenders. Super Netball: HT: Thunderbirds 24-21 Magpies - The Magpies pinched the second bonus point of the game but the Thunderbirds retain a three point lead at half-time. The visitors levelled briefly but are shooting at just 72% accuracy, a figure that is hampering their efforts to chase down the Giants in the race for the finals. A comprehensive demolition job at the SCG with the Roosters carving the Titans open at will to fly up to second on the ladder. Latrell Mitchell bagged 26 points, Brett Morris nabbed a hat-trick, and James Tedesco powered forward for 280 metres gained. Not a bad day for Cooper Cronk to celebrate a career century of tries. AFL: QT: Carlton 4.1 (25) v West Coast 2.5 (17) - Carlton\u2019s renaissance under David Teague continues apace with an impressive opening quarter against the powerful Eagles. Nic Newman kicked a couple and Sam Walsh already has 12 disposals to his name as the young Blues took it to their more fancied opponents. A handy percentage-boosting day out for Collingwood at the MCG. Will Hoskin-Elliott kicked four, Adam Treloar commandeered 35 possessions, and Brodie Grundy did pretty much everything in a very nice 69 point victory. The Pies will feature in September but they\u2019re going to need a series of unlikely results to go their way if they\u2019re any chance of a late dash into the top four. The Suns remain rooted to the foot of the ladder and deserving of little further commentary. Super Netball: QT: Thunderbirds 15-11 Magpies - The hosts have secured the opening bonus point of the match at Priceline Stadium in a scrappy opening quarter. Both sides were shooting at just 79% accuracy but with the Thunderbirds dominating possession they hit the first break in front. Shamera Sterling starred for Adelaide with three gains. NRL: 60 mins: Roosters 46-0 Titans - In a season of low points the Titans are plumbing new depths at the SCG. The Roosters are on their way back up to second on the ladder and with a healthy points difference boost to boot. Super Netball: And we\u2019re underway in the second Super Netball contest of the afternoon with the fifth-placed Magpies keen to keep the pressure on the Giants in the race for the finals. They have ventured to Adelaide to battle the second-from-bottom Thunderbirds. AFL: We\u2019re underway in the second AFL contest of the day with the Eagles facing the awkward proposition of a rejuvenated Carlton at Marvel Stadium. An away win will move West Coast level on points with Geelong on top of the ladder. AFL: 3QT: Collingwood 16.8 (104) v Gold Coast 6.3 (39) - If Nathan Buckley needed a run out to help boost his side\u2019s confidence this is the fixture he would have dreamed of. The Pies are embarrassing the Suns at the MCG. The Firebirds put up one heck of a fight in Canberra but they remain last on the Super Netball ladder and winless for the season. The Giants recovered from their early scare to prevail in a bruising encounter, securing two bonus points along the way to help shore up fourth place with just three rounds remaining. Jo Harten was named as the player of the match with 34 goals from 40 shots. Drugs in Sport: While Shayna Jack is making headlines, what is it actually like to be suspended from professional sport for a doping infraction? Cyclist Ben HIll opens up in a powerful firsthand account. I returned to my parents\u2019 place in rural New South Wales and sank into depression. I sat on the couch for months. There was this big hole in my life, and nothing could fill it. Cycling was my dream \u2013 my career had been heading in the right direction \u2013 and suddenly it felt over. I felt abandoned by the cycling community. Cycling Australia didn\u2019t offer any support; they made an example of me. NRL: HT: Roosters 28-0 Titans - This was always likely to be a one-sided affair, and so it is proving at the SCG. Super Netball: 3QT: Giants 49-41 Firebirds - That strong early burst by the Firebirds now seems an age away. After wrestling control late in the second quarter the Giants tore clear in the third, establishing what should be a match-winning margin. Tennis: Nick Kygrios has been at his swaggering brilliant best this week in Washington DC, and with the help of the crowd and no shortage of trick shots he\u2019s through to the final of the 500-point Citi Open. It\u2019s been far from a vintage season for the Australian but he\u2019s now just one match away from his second title. AFL: HT: Collingwood 10.6 (66) v Gold Coast 5.2 (32) - The Suns kept the Pies honest early on in this contest but it was one-way traffic in the second quarter with Collingwood bolting to a substantial lead. Jamie Elliott and Travis Varcoe both have braces while Treloar is up to 21 possessions. NRL: 10 mins: Roosters 12-0 Titans - And the Roosters have already crossed twice! This could be a long old day for Gold Coast. NRL: The first NRL fixture of the day is underway with the Titans making their first appearance at the SCG to take on the Roosters. Football: Some sad news to report from this weekend with the death of Damien Lovelock, one of the most interesting and idiosyncratic figures in Australian sport and Australian sport broadcasting. Andrew Stafford sums up a life well lived. Above all, he was a fabulous raconteur. Lovelock was a big man with a big voice and a hell of a lot of stories. Silence wasn\u2019t in his vocabulary. Even in his yoga sessions, he peppered his students with anecdotes that had them trying to maintain poses in between contortions of laughter. This combination of physical mastery and people skills saw him hired as an instructor by, among others, the New South Wales State of Origin rugby league team. Super Netball: HT: Giants 28-29 Firebirds - The Firebirds haven\u2019t celebrated a win all season but they remain ahead of the finals-chasing Giants this afternoon - but only just. In a physical contest with plenty of incident the hosts fought back late in the second quarter to snatch the bonus point on offer and reduce the deficit to a solitary goal. Despite her grisly injury Gretel Tippett is 14 from 14 for the visitors. Football: Thomas Deng is emerging as a leading figure for Australian football on and off the field, as Lucas Radbourne reports. It\u2019s our time. The right time for someone to speak out and be a voice for Africans in Melbourne. We need to show ourselves more. AFL: QT: Collingwood 4.4 (28) v Gold Coast 3.2 (20) - The Suns kicked the opening couple of goals at the MCG but the Pies responded to sneak into the lead in the shadow of quarter time. Adam Treloar already has a goal and 12 disposals to his name. Super Netball: QT: Giants 13-15 Firebirds - It was a funny opening quarter in Canberra and it ends with the underdogs ahead by a couple of goals. The Giants turned in an error-strewn performance and deservedly went behind early, and despite a late rally they failed to secure the bonus point. The major talking point was the facial injury sustained by Gretel Tippett but she\u2019s been patched up and is back on the bench for the Firebirds. Cricket: Before we forget about the Ashes (for now) I thought this little nugget was worth sharing, from the stat master Ric Finlay. I wonder if WinViz includes a dedicated Steve Smith weighting? If not, they look questionable numbers considering the state of the pitch and the form of Australia\u2019s number four. Super Netball: Oof! Trouble early for the Firebirds and Gretel Tippett. The star forward doesn\u2019t look good clutching her face on the bench. That could be a nasty break. Cricket: Finally, for now, some reaction from the protagonists, and Chris Woakes\u2019 head-scratching over the impossible job of troubling Steve Smith. The pace has gone out of it, so you almost have to build pressure, maybe attack at the other end and hold the other. But Steve doesn\u2019t make many mistakes. We\u2019ll look at a few plans overnight and see what we can come up with. Cricket: The England perspective is provided by Barney Ronay and his salute to Stuart Broad. Broad has loved these contests. Unlike Anderson, whose numbers take a dive against the Aussies, Broad\u2019s game rises to meet England\u2019s most consistently cussed opponents, particularly in the English summer. Cricket: Steve Smith was also the focus of Geoff Lemon\u2019s attention, and his eye was trained on more than the former skipper\u2019s batting. The interesting thing about this is that Smith has not finished his punishment. His year-long ban from playing has ended, but not the second year\u2019s ban from holding leadership positions in any Australia team. So it was equally interesting to see him in the slip cordon as Australia tried to take the last few English first-innings wickets, directing traffic in the field as smoothly as he ever did while captain. Cricket: Before we become consumed with all the live action we should probably take stock of the overnight Ashes action. The opening Test at Edgbaston remains beautifully poised, thanks in the main to the amazing Steve Smith. Here\u2019s how Vic Marks saw things. Yet again Steve Smith is the obstacle driving the English to distraction. While he is still at the crease nothing can be guaranteed. In front of another packed house here England made some solid progress: a first-innings lead of 90 and three early scalps when Australia batted again. But Smith, who reminded us on the first day how he can transform an innings, remained. Hello everybody and welcome to another busy Sunday sportwatching. As the various races for the finals intensify we\u2019re across the AFL, NRL and Super Netball before our attention turns to what\u2019s happening on the other side of the world and the engrossing start to the Ashes. The first action of note is underway around 1pm with the Giants continuing their push for the Super Netball playoffs against the bottom-placed Firebirds. There\u2019s a second helping of Super Netball later on when the Magpies will bid to keep their finals hopes alive against the Thunderbirds. That begins at 3pm. In the AFL Collingwood will be confident of snapping their two match losing streak at home to Gold Coast from 1.10pm before West Coast travel to an in-form Carlton at 3.20pm. The round concludes at 4.40pm with Brisbane hosting the Bulldogs in a fixture that could see the Lions move joint-top on the ladder. The NRL is open for business at 2pm with the Roosters licking their lips at a percentage-boosting opportunity against the Titans. At 4.05pm the Eels can improve their finals equation against the Dragons. If you want to join in the fun you can shoot me an email or a tweet, while comments should be open for you to gossip below the line.",

That said, the Spurs game will be a Premier League bow for eight of our likely XI, so talk of the top 10 is surely too bullish. 14th will do \u2013 safe by Easter.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal If you can\u2019t be optimistic in pre-season it\u2019s time to hang up your hundred quid replica kit. That said, while recent spending has lifted the mood, there\u2019s been scant evidence of any fix to our defensive inadequacies. In the absence of Unai imposing a definitive brand of football, I\u2019m still fearful that the upshot will be the same as it ever was. Key men/weak links Despite the Kroenkes relaxing their grip on the purse strings to sign P\u00e9p\u00e9, we\u2019re still lacking proven talent elsewhere, leaving us praying that the bevy of talented youngsters \u2013 Willock, Nelson, Smith Rowe, Medley, Nketiah, Saka, John-Jules, Burton \u2013 will fulfil their promise. We need to sign Kieran Tierney would be a result, but it\u2019s the heart of our defence which requires most urgent attention. Mustafi getting the bird from our home crowd before this campaign has even started says it all. Headline maker Sadly it looks like the Mesut \u00d6zil saga is set to run and run. VAR: good or bad? To stop it becoming a constant distraction its use has to be strictly limited to resolving just \u201cclear and obvious\u201d errors. Nothing more. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: Third. Top four: 1. Liverpool; 2. Man City; 3. Arsenal; 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Brighton; 19. Aston Villa; 20. Sheffield United. First manager sacked: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. \u2022 Bernard Azulay GoonersDiary.co.uk @GoonerN5 Aston Villa We chose \u201cLove don\u2019t live here anymore\u201d as the song to accompany Villa\u2019s demise three years ago. Suddenly \u201cLove is all around\u201d. Season ticket sales are through the roof, the homegrown manager and captain have been deified and we\u2019ve splashed the cash. It\u2019s impossible not to be excited. Grealish is a top-six player, nobody will outrun McGinn and Mings is ballast. That said, the Spurs game will be a Premier League bow for eight of our likely XI, so talk of the top 10 is surely too bullish. 14th will do \u2013 safe by Easter. We certainly won\u2019t \u201cdo a Fulham\u201d \u2013 but even if we do, the Championship is bloody marvellous anyway. Key men/weak links Grealish won\u2019t get kicked so much in the Premier League. Every Villa fan would love Jota to star given where he came from, but McGinn has hints of Souness (nails), Dalglish (vision, big arse) and Macari (good terrace song) and may really impress. We need to sign Wesley could go either way, so probably some striking cover. Headline maker The tabloids would love it if Terry slipped up but he\u2019s been nothing but a positive since he joined. Wesley is a bit of a non-conformist apparently so that might be fun, and Jack will always be one who enjoys his and our success \u2026 and why not? Footballers are too boring these days. VAR: good or bad? It\u2019s a joke. Human error is a (sometimes delicious) part of the game. I also like to get back to the pub within three hours of the kick-off. The pluses of \u201cmore right decisions\u201d are far outweighed by the downsides of breaks in play and general \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d periods. And how can you go nuts with the spectre of VAR looming over every goal? Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 14th. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Brighton; 19. Newcastle; 20. Norwich. First manager sacked: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. \u2022 Jonathan Pritchard Observer reader Bournemouth There\u2019s more apprehension than usual. With the club funding a new training complex, the money for players has been a bit more restricted this summer. Mid-table would be a good season. Key men/weak links Wilson, Fraser and Brooks will be the players most talked about \u2013 the latter when he\u2019s back from injury. It\u2019ll be Fraser\u2019s last season due to his contract running down. A few youngsters to watch: Lloyd Kelly at left-back and Sam Surridge up front, plus keepers Mark Travers and Aaron Ramsdale, if they aren\u2019t loaned out. As for weaknesses: I\u2019m still not convinced about Solanke, Begovic or Ibe. We need to sign A top keeper, perhaps Jack Butland, and another midfield option \u2013 Liverpool\u2019s Harry Wilson would be ideal. But I\u2019m pleased to have signed Philip Billing from Huddersfield \u2013 we\u2019ve always lacked height. Headline maker You can pick any of our current back four, or keeper, to make a few talked-about blunders. VAR: good or bad? Bad. Who wants every goal double and triple checked before it\u2019s given? Fans want to celebrate, not wait and hope. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 12th. Top four: 1. Liverpool; 2. Man City; 3. Tottenham; 4. Arsenal. Bottom three: 18. Sheffield United; 19. Aston Villa; 20. Brighton. First manager sacked: Steve Bruce. \u2022 Peter Bell afcbchimes.blogspot.co.uk @cherrychimes Brighton It\u2019s a case of fingers crossed. Much lies on the shoulders of Graham Potter after the heart-wrenchingly sad sacking of Chris Hughton. Potter will have to work his magic on what he inherited \u2013 who knows if he can do that? A lot of players need to step up (yes, you, Locadia, Jahanbakhsh, Andone) but maybe Potter is the man to lift them. Tony Bloom obviously thinks so, and that\u2019s good enough for me. Key men/weak links A lot will be expected of our new \u00a315m winger Leandro Trossard, especially after the (welcome) exit of hotheaded Anthony Knockaert. Elsewhere, young Aaron Connolly could break through, and if Dunk goes, new signing Adam Webster will need to settle in fast. No weak links \u2013 although\u2026 We need to sign A striker. Or are we going to be relying on Glenn Murray again? He\u2019s 36 in September. Headline maker Hopefully Potter as the division\u2019s most inspired managerial appointment. Our exciting, attacking play will be a joy to watch and give even Pep Guardiola food for thought, right? VAR: good or bad? It made Manchester City\u2019s Champions League defeat by Spurs enormously entertaining for neutrals. But as the system is still based on an opinion, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s conclusive enough for all the fuss it causes. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 10th. Top four: 1. Liverpool; 2. Man City; 3. Arsenal; 4. Tottenham. Bottom three: 18. Crystal Palace; 19. Norwich; 20. Aston Villa. First manager sacked: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. \u2022 Steph Fincham Observer reader Burnley I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to trouble the top six but there are any number of reasons to be optimistic \u2013 more so given the second half of last season when not many teams bettered our points return. Key men/weak links Hopefully we\u2019ll be defensively organised and so, as always, the attention turns towards the front. We will be needing Barnes, Wood, Rodriguez and Vydra to get those goals. Also watch out for Dwight McNeil, who broke through last season. Central midfielder Josh Benson has looked good in pre-season, too \u2013 there are high hopes for him. We\u2019ve got cover for most positions now, and we\u2019ve reached the point where we can just about put out two different teams. As always, it\u2019s the unit that\u2019s the strength at Burnley and I don\u2019t see that changing. We need to sign The centre of midfield could do with strengthening, particularly given Steven Defour\u2019s continuing injury problems. When he\u2019s available he makes so much difference, but we can\u2019t rely on his fitness. We need to add a quality, mobile operator to the squad. Headline maker Barnes is supposed to be the dressing room clown, but, as always, Sean Dyche will dominate our news. VAR: good or bad? Ask me in a year. I have real concerns: I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019ll be beneficial. It\u2019s hard to see how it won\u2019t generate its own controversy. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 12th. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. Arsenal. Bottom three: 18. Brighton; 19. Norwich; 20. Sheffield United. First manager sacked: Daniel Farke. \u2022 Tony Scholes UpTheClarets.com @UTCdotcom Chelsea I\u2019m pretty optimistic \u2013 probably more so than I should be given the transfer ban. We have an inexperienced manager \u2013 but that manager is Frank Lampard, and that\u2019s what makes me optimistic. A man who understands today\u2019s players, understands the club\u2019s hierarchy and who played under some of the best managers in the world. Key men/weak links All eyes on Pulisic, given that he\u2019s meant to be Hazard\u2019s replacement. No pressure then \u2026 Players often need at least a season to get used to the speed and physicality of the Premier League, so I\u2019m not going to expect too much this season. We need to sign The damn ban means we\u2019re stuck with the issues we\u2019ve had for a few years: up front, at left- and right-back, and at centre-back, too. Headline maker I can see Jody Morris being to Lampard what Rui Faria was to Mourinho \u2013 not that Mourinho couldn\u2019t get into trouble on his own. I think Jody may initiate a Chelsea Fight Club. But, of course, I can\u2019t say anymore, because the first rule of Fight Club is\u2026 VAR: good or bad? I can just about put up with technology to confirm whether the ball has crossed the line. Everything else \u2013 no \u2013 just no. I want to howl at a referee error, scream at the injustice of it all, become apoplectic with rage at a missed red card tackle; I want to laugh my ass off when we score an offside goal against Spurs, grin like a lunatic when the wrong Manchester United player gets sent off, and guffaw when the ref overlooks a Liverpool stonewall penalty (as if\u2026). The point is our game is passionate not despite the flaws but because of the flaws. VAR is nonsense. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 3rd. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Tottenham; 3. Chelsea; 4. Liverpool. Bottom three: 18. Newcastle; 19. Brighton; 20. Aston Villa. First manager sacked: Steve Bruce. \u2022 Trizia Fiorellino ChelseaSupportersGroup.net Crystal Palace We\u2019ve sold our second-best player, and have, so far, only signed a third-choice keeper. Oh, and made Jordan Ayew\u2019s move from Swansea permanent. Add to that the pressure on wages, the noise surrounding the American part-owners looking to sell their stake, and daily speculation on Zaha, and Palace fans are a little nervous right now. Key men/weak links We simply must keep Zaha. The return of Sakho and Tomkins to fitness will be welcome, and Max Meyer has had a strong pre-season. Lack of numbers mean we may have to use youngsters such as Sam Woods and Luke Dreher on the bench. We need to sign Our striking options \u2013 yet again \u2013 look weak. We still need a quality forward but I doubt we have the funds. And the lack of right- and left-backs is a real concern. Headline maker The ownership of the club will take up some column inches. VAR: good or bad? Palace will undoubtedly win a lot more penalties this season \u2013 Luka Milivojevic will surely be top scorer. But the fear is the potential lack of joy after scoring, with the threat of a VAR appeal lurking in the background ready to cancel it out. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 14th. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Brighton; 19. Newcastle; 20. Norwich. First manager sacked: Steve Bruce. \u2022 Chris Waters PalaceTrust.org.uk @Clapham_Grand Everton Realistically, the fight is to break into a regular European spot \u2013 but above all else, Evertonians want silverware: 24 years without it is far too long, so the cups have to be a priority for Marco Silva. Recovering from the disastrous Koeman/Allardyce eras, Brands and Silva have their work cut out to reduce the squad while improving quality \u2013 but signing Digne, Gomes, Gbamin, Bernard and Delph suggests they are achieving that. Key men/weak links Besides those new arrivals, Richarlison is key. Without a proven scorer \u2013 the mythical Everton No 9 \u2013 he\u2019ll be under great pressure to improve on his 13 goals last year.

But it takes its cue from another tragedy, more distant in time and place. On 4 October 1992, a cargo plane <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/04/1\" title=\"\">crashed</a> into two high-rise blocks of flats in the Bijlmer, a working-class district of Amsterdam, killing more than 40 people. Four years later, on a warm day in early May, the residents of Goldie\u2019s titular block of council flats find their worlds shattered by a similar aviation disaster.</p> <p>Among them are Malachi, a broken-hearted student who is struggling to raise his streetwise kid brother, Tristan; Mary, the salty Filipino nurse with a secret life she keeps from her family; Pamela, a teenage athlete whose father has become her jailer; and vulnerable Elvis, who loves his new home, with its laminated instructions and the fridge filled by his carer. Their perspectives \u2013 each distinct and believable, even if some feel more authentic than others \u2013 define alternating chapters as the sirens rise and fall.</p> <p>\u201cGetting out of the building should have been the hardest thing we had to do,\u201d one survivor says to another. \u201cBut sometimes it feels like that was only the start.\u201d Accordingly, the novel is barely halfway through when a crane arrives to remove the plane\u2019s carcass, and its final scene takes place on the crash\u2019s fifth anniversary. In the intervening pages, race, politics, urban community and mental health all feed into the struggles faced by survivors. Ultimately, though, theirs is a story of love at its most tenacious, a story of love and resilience.</p> <p>Goldie, a primary school teacher who won the 2017 Costa short story award and has been mentored by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/27/white-privilege-is-used-by-women-against-black-men-as-a-tool-of-oppression\" title=\"\">Courttia Newland</a>corr as part of a scheme for emerging authors of colour, is a warm, confident writer with the lightest of touches. Her ear for dialogue is acute and her pacing near-faultless. She can be funny, too. Tristan notes, after hearing some sixth form girls describe his brother as \u201cdark and brooding\u201d: \u201cThat apparently doesn\u2019t just mean he\u2019s black and grumpy.\u201d</p> <p>All the indications are that <em>Nightingale Point</em> was begun long before Grenfell. In an author\u2019s note, Goldie refers to the tragedy directly, declaring her novel a tribute to those whose fight to rebuild their lives continues. To her considerable credit, she\u2019s managed to create a world that does this in such a way as to make the book relevant without seeming opportunistic.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Nightingale Point </em>by Luan Goldie is published by HQ (\u00a312.99).

Four years later, on a warm day in early May, the residents of Goldie\u2019s titular block of council flats find their worlds shattered by a similar aviation disaster. Among them are Malachi, a broken-hearted student who is struggling to raise his streetwise kid brother, Tristan; Mary, the salty Filipino nurse with a secret life she keeps from her family; Pamela, a teenage athlete whose father has become her jailer; and vulnerable Elvis, who loves his new home, with its laminated instructions and the fridge filled by his carer. Their perspectives \u2013 each distinct and believable, even if some feel more authentic than others \u2013 define alternating chapters as the sirens rise and fall. \u201cGetting out of the building should have been the hardest thing we had to do,\u201d one survivor says to another. \u201cBut sometimes it feels like that was only the start.\u201d Accordingly, the novel is barely halfway through when a crane arrives to remove the plane\u2019s carcass, and its final scene takes place on the crash\u2019s fifth anniversary. In the intervening pages, race, politics, urban community and mental health all feed into the struggles faced by survivors. Ultimately, though, theirs is a story of love at its most tenacious, a story of love and resilience. Goldie, a primary school teacher who won the 2017 Costa short story award and has been mentored by Courttia Newlandcorr as part of a scheme for emerging authors of colour, is a warm, confident writer with the lightest of touches. Her ear for dialogue is acute and her pacing near-faultless. She can be funny, too. Tristan notes, after hearing some sixth form girls describe his brother as \u201cdark and brooding\u201d: \u201cThat apparently doesn\u2019t just mean he\u2019s black and grumpy.\u201d All the indications are that Nightingale Point was begun long before Grenfell. In an author\u2019s note, Goldie refers to the tragedy directly, declaring her novel a tribute to those whose fight to rebuild their lives continues. To her considerable credit, she\u2019s managed to create a world that does this in such a way as to make the book relevant without seeming opportunistic. \u2022 Nightingale Point by Luan Goldie is published by HQ (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<p>Paul Wilks runs a Budgens supermarket in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Like most retail owners, he\u2019d had problems with shoplifting \u2013 largely carried out by a relatively small number of repeat offenders. Then a year or so ago, exasperated, he installed something called <a href=\"https://www.facewatch.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Facewatch</a>. It\u2019s a facial-recognition system that watches people coming into the store; it has a database of \u201csubjects of interest\u201d (SOIs), and if it recognises one, it sends a discreet alert to the store manager. \u201cIf someone triggers the alert,\u201d says Paul, \u201cthey\u2019re approached by a member of management, and asked to leave, and most of the time they duly do.\u201d</p> <p>Facial recognition, in one form or another, is in the news most weeks at the moment. Recently, a novelty phone app, FaceApp, which takes your photo and ages it to show what you\u2019ll look like in a few decades, caused a public freakout when people realised it was a Russian company and decided it was using their faces for surveillance. (It appears to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/18/faceapp-privacy-data-russians\" title=\"\">doing nothing especially </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/18/faceapp-privacy-data-russians\" title=\"\">objectionable</a>.) More seriously, the city authority in San Francisco have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/14/san-francisco-facial-recognition-police-ban\" title=\"\">banned the use</a> of facial-recognition technologies by the police and other government agencies; and the House of Commons science and technology committee has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49030595\" title=\"\">called for British police</a> to stop using it as well, until regulation is in place, though the then home secretary (now chancellor) Sajid Javid, said he was in favour of trials continuing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The algorithm assesses faces by gradients of light and\u00a0dark, allowing it\u00a0to detect\u00a0points on\u00a0the face and build\u00a0an\u00a0image</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is a growing demand for the technology in shops, with dozens of companies selling retail facial-recognition software \u2013 perhaps because, in recent years, it has become pointless to report shoplifting to the police. Budgets for policing in England have been cut in real terms <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43699623\" title=\"\">by about 20%</a> since 2010, and a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45512468\" title=\"\">change in the law</a> in 2014, whereby shoplifting of goods below a value of \u00a3200 was made a summary offence (ie less serious, not to be tried by a jury), meant police directed time and resources away from shoplifting. The number of people being arrested and charged has fallen dramatically, with less than 10% of shoplifting now reported. The British Retail Consortium trade group <a href=\"https://realbusiness.co.uk/price-tag-700m-put-uks-rising-retail-crime/\" title=\"\">estimates that \u00a3700</a><a href=\"https://realbusiness.co.uk/price-tag-700m-put-uks-rising-retail-crime/\" title=\"\">m</a> is lost annually to theft. Retailers are looking for other methods. The rapid improvement in AI technologies, and the dramatic fall in cost, mean that it is now viable as one of those other methods.</p> <p>\u201cThe systems are getting better year on year,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.gre.ac.uk/people/rep/faculty-of-education-and-health/josh-davis\" title=\"\">Josh Davis</a>, a psychologist at the University of Greenwich who works on facial recognition in humans and AIs.

In the wild \u2013 with the camera looking down, often poorly lit and lower-definition \u2013 it\u2019s far less effective, says Prof Maja Pantic, an AI researcher at Imperial College London. \u201cIt\u2019s far from the 99.9% you get with mugshots,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is good, and moving relatively fast forward.\u201d</p> <p>Each algorithm is different, but fundamentally, they work the same way. They are given large numbers of images of people and are told which ones are the same people; they then analyse those images to pick out the features that identify them. Those features are not things like \u201csize of ear\u201d or \u201clength of nose\u201d, says Pantic, but something like textures: the algorithm assesses faces by gradients of light and dark, which allow it to detect points on the face and build a 3D image. \u201cIf you grow a beard or gain a lot of weight,\u201d she says, \u201cvery often a passport control machine cannot recognise you, because a large part of the texture is different.\u201d</p> <p>But while the algorithms are understood at this quite high level, the specific things that they use to identify people are not and cannot be known in detail. It\u2019s a black box: the training data goes into the algorithm, sloshes around a bit, and produces very effective systems, but the exact way it works is not clear to the developer. \u201cWe don\u2019t have theoretical proofs of anything,\u201d says Pantic. The problem is that there is so much data: you could go into the system and disentangle what it was doing if it had looked at a few tens of photos, perhaps, or a few hundred, but when it has looked at millions, each containing large amounts of data itself, it becomes impossible. \u201cThe transparency is not there,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you\u2019ve committed a\u00a0crime, you need to go through\u00a0the criminal\u00a0justice system.\u00a0We\u2019re entering the\u00a0sphere of pre-crime</p> <footer> <cite>Silkie Carlo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, neither she nor Davis is unduly worried about the rise of facial recognition. \u201cI don\u2019t really see what the big issue is,\u201d Pantic says. Police prosecutions at the moment often rely on eyewitnesses, \u201cwho say \u2018sure, that\u2019s him, that\u2019s her\u2019, but it\u2019s not\u201d: at least facial recognition, she says, can be more accurate. She is concerned about other invasions of privacy, of intrusions by the government into our phones, but, she says, facial recognition represents a \u201cfairly limited cost of privacy\u201d given the gains it can provide, and given how much privacy we\u2019ve already given up by having our phones on us all the time. \u201cThe GPS knows exactly where you are, what you\u2019re eating, when you go to the office, whether you stayed out,\u201d she says. \u201cThe faces are the cherry on top of the pie, and we talk about the cherry and forget about the pie.\u201d</p> <p>As with all algorithmic assessment, there is reasonable concern about bias. No algorithm is better than its dataset, and \u2013 simply put \u2013 there are more pictures of white people on the internet than there are of black people. \u201cWe have less data on dark-skinned people,\u201d says Pantic. \u201cLarge databases of Caucasian people, not so large on Chinese and Indian, desperately bad on people of African descent.\u201d Davis says there is an additional problem, that darker skin reflects less light, providing less information for the algorithms to work with.

Nick Fisher, Facewatch\u2019s CEO, showed me a demo version; he walked through a door and a wall-mounted camera in front of him took a photo of his face; immediately, an alert came up on his phone (he\u2019s in the system as an SOI, so he can demonstrate it). I did the same thing, and it recognised me as a face, but no alert was sent and, he said, the face data was immediately deleted, because I was not an SOI.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caf19b33c7361d9862eca717b9dfb62098833607\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caf19b33c7361d9862eca717b9dfb62098833607/0_169_5418_3250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"protesters agains amazon wearing jeff bezos masks in seattle in october 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in Seattle demonstrating against Amazon\u2019s Rekognition technology, October 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Facewatch are keen to say that they\u2019re not a technology company themselves \u2013 they\u2019re a data management company.

The difference, they say, is that it is not relying on untrained humans to spot those troublemakers, but a much more accurate system.</p> <p>The problem is that, at the moment, there is very little regulation \u2013 other than GDPR \u2013 governing what you can and can\u2019t do with a facial-recognition system. Facewatch say, loudly and often, that they want regulation, so they know what they are legally allowed to do. On the other hand, Carlo and Big Brother Watch, along with other civil liberties groups, want an urgent moratorium and a detailed democratic debate about the extent to which we are happy with technologies like these in our lives. \u201cOur politicians don\u2019t seem to be aware that we\u2019re living through a seismic technological revolution,\u201d she says. \u201cJumping straight to legislation and \u2018safeguards\u2019 is to short-circuit what needs to be a much bigger exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Either way, it needs to happen fast.

      "bodyText": "Paul Wilks runs a Budgens supermarket in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Like most retail owners, he\u2019d had problems with shoplifting \u2013 largely carried out by a relatively small number of repeat offenders. Then a year or so ago, exasperated, he installed something called Facewatch. It\u2019s a facial-recognition system that watches people coming into the store; it has a database of \u201csubjects of interest\u201d (SOIs), and if it recognises one, it sends a discreet alert to the store manager. \u201cIf someone triggers the alert,\u201d says Paul, \u201cthey\u2019re approached by a member of management, and asked to leave, and most of the time they duly do.\u201d Facial recognition, in one form or another, is in the news most weeks at the moment. Recently, a novelty phone app, FaceApp, which takes your photo and ages it to show what you\u2019ll look like in a few decades, caused a public freakout when people realised it was a Russian company and decided it was using their faces for surveillance. (It appears to have been doing nothing especially objectionable.) More seriously, the city authority in San Francisco have banned the use of facial-recognition technologies by the police and other government agencies; and the House of Commons science and technology committee has called for British police to stop using it as well, until regulation is in place, though the then home secretary (now chancellor) Sajid Javid, said he was in favour of trials continuing. There is a growing demand for the technology in shops, with dozens of companies selling retail facial-recognition software \u2013 perhaps because, in recent years, it has become pointless to report shoplifting to the police. Budgets for policing in England have been cut in real terms by about 20% since 2010, and a change in the law in 2014, whereby shoplifting of goods below a value of \u00a3200 was made a summary offence (ie less serious, not to be tried by a jury), meant police directed time and resources away from shoplifting. The number of people being arrested and charged has fallen dramatically, with less than 10% of shoplifting now reported. The British Retail Consortium trade group estimates that \u00a3700m is lost annually to theft. Retailers are looking for other methods. The rapid improvement in AI technologies, and the dramatic fall in cost, mean that it is now viable as one of those other methods. \u201cThe systems are getting better year on year,\u201d says Josh Davis, a psychologist at the University of Greenwich who works on facial recognition in humans and AIs. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology assesses the state of facial recognition every year, he says, and the ability of the best algorithms to match a new image to a face in a database improved 20-fold between 2014 and 2018. And analogously with Moore\u2019s law, about computer processing power doubling every year \u2013 the cost falls annually as well. In ideal environments such as airport check-ins, where the face is straight on and well lit and the camera is high-quality, AI face recognition is now better than human, and has been since at least 2014. In the wild \u2013 with the camera looking down, often poorly lit and lower-definition \u2013 it\u2019s far less effective, says Prof Maja Pantic, an AI researcher at Imperial College London. \u201cIt\u2019s far from the 99.9% you get with mugshots,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is good, and moving relatively fast forward.\u201d Each algorithm is different, but fundamentally, they work the same way. They are given large numbers of images of people and are told which ones are the same people; they then analyse those images to pick out the features that identify them. Those features are not things like \u201csize of ear\u201d or \u201clength of nose\u201d, says Pantic, but something like textures: the algorithm assesses faces by gradients of light and dark, which allow it to detect points on the face and build a 3D image. \u201cIf you grow a beard or gain a lot of weight,\u201d she says, \u201cvery often a passport control machine cannot recognise you, because a large part of the texture is different.\u201d But while the algorithms are understood at this quite high level, the specific things that they use to identify people are not and cannot be known in detail. It\u2019s a black box: the training data goes into the algorithm, sloshes around a bit, and produces very effective systems, but the exact way it works is not clear to the developer. \u201cWe don\u2019t have theoretical proofs of anything,\u201d says Pantic. The problem is that there is so much data: you could go into the system and disentangle what it was doing if it had looked at a few tens of photos, perhaps, or a few hundred, but when it has looked at millions, each containing large amounts of data itself, it becomes impossible. \u201cThe transparency is not there,\u201d she says. Still, neither she nor Davis is unduly worried about the rise of facial recognition. \u201cI don\u2019t really see what the big issue is,\u201d Pantic says. Police prosecutions at the moment often rely on eyewitnesses, \u201cwho say \u2018sure, that\u2019s him, that\u2019s her\u2019, but it\u2019s not\u201d: at least facial recognition, she says, can be more accurate. She is concerned about other invasions of privacy, of intrusions by the government into our phones, but, she says, facial recognition represents a \u201cfairly limited cost of privacy\u201d given the gains it can provide, and given how much privacy we\u2019ve already given up by having our phones on us all the time. \u201cThe GPS knows exactly where you are, what you\u2019re eating, when you go to the office, whether you stayed out,\u201d she says. \u201cThe faces are the cherry on top of the pie, and we talk about the cherry and forget about the pie.\u201d As with all algorithmic assessment, there is reasonable concern about bias. No algorithm is better than its dataset, and \u2013 simply put \u2013 there are more pictures of white people on the internet than there are of black people. \u201cWe have less data on dark-skinned people,\u201d says Pantic. \u201cLarge databases of Caucasian people, not so large on Chinese and Indian, desperately bad on people of African descent.\u201d Davis says there is an additional problem, that darker skin reflects less light, providing less information for the algorithms to work with. For these two reasons algorithms are more likely to correctly identify white people than black people. \u201cThat\u2019s problematic for stop and search,\u201d says Davis. Silkie Carlo, the director of the not-for-profit civil liberties organisation Big Brother Watch, describes one situation where an 14-year-old black schoolboy was \u201cswooped by four officers, put up against a wall, fingerprinted, phone taken, before police realised the face recognition had got the wrong guy\u201d. That said, the Facewatch facial-recognition system is, at least on white men under the highly controlled conditions of their office, unnervingly good. Nick Fisher, Facewatch\u2019s CEO, showed me a demo version; he walked through a door and a wall-mounted camera in front of him took a photo of his face; immediately, an alert came up on his phone (he\u2019s in the system as an SOI, so he can demonstrate it). I did the same thing, and it recognised me as a face, but no alert was sent and, he said, the face data was immediately deleted, because I was not an SOI. Facewatch are keen to say that they\u2019re not a technology company themselves \u2013 they\u2019re a data management company. They provide management of the watch lists in what they say is compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If someone is seen shoplifting on camera or by a staff member, their image can be stored as an SOI; if they are then seen in that shop again, the shop manager will get an alert. GDPR allows these watch lists to be shared in a \u201cproportionate\u201d way; so if you\u2019re caught on camera like this once, it can be shared with other local Facewatch users. In London, says Fisher, that would be an eight-mile radius. If you\u2019re seen stealing repeatedly in many different cities, it could proportionately be shared nationwide; if you\u2019re never seen stealing again, your face is taken off the database after two years. Carlo is not reassured: she says that it involves placing a lot of trust in retail companies and their security staff to use this technology fairly. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about police but security staff who aren\u2019t held to the same professional standards. They get stuff wrong all the time. What if they have an altercation [with a customer] or a grievance?\u201d The SOI database system, she says, subverts our justice system. \u201cHow do you know if you\u2019re on the watch list? You\u2019re not guilty of anything, in the legal sense. If there\u2019s proof that you\u2019ve committed a crime, you need to go through the criminal justice system; otherwise we\u2019re in a system of private policing. We\u2019re entering the sphere of pre-crime.\u201d Fisher and Facewatch, though, argue that it is not so unlike the age-old practice of shops and bars having pictures up in the staff room of regular troublemakers. The difference, they say, is that it is not relying on untrained humans to spot those troublemakers, but a much more accurate system.

I turned to the web for some answers, and Google turned up trumps: much to my horror, my symptoms matched some of those for the tick-borne bacterial infection Lyme disease.</p> <p>My GP was doubtful (we lived in London and I had not noticed any ticks on me) but agreed to a blood test. It came back positive so the rest of my family was tested. My husband and daughter also had it but, ironically, my son \u2013 on whom I had spotted a tick \u2013 did not.

When I got it, I was shocked to find how easily it could be transmitted, how unreliable testing for it was, and how awful the consequences were for those who didn\u2019t get the right diagnosis in time.</p> <p>My symptoms ruined our Christmas holiday and the antibiotics affected my daughter\u2019s health during school exams. But we were fortunate. I subsequently learned that of two others who contracted Lyme in the New Forest, one \u2013 a child \u2013 was affected neurologically.</p> <p>Given that the hosts for the New Forest ticks were deer, suffice to say, I no longer felt like crying at the film <em>Bambi</em> and \u2013 unpopular opinion alert \u2013 I began hoping people would view the deer in Richmond Park not through misty eyes but through sights on a rifle. (I was not alone.

The International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society states: \u201cA patient\u2019s residence does not necessarily reflect his or her Lyme disease risk. People travel, pets travel and ticks travel. \u201cMigratory birds carry ticks over great distances,\u201d it adds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt devastated by the illness, so to be told it was in my head because the test was negative was awful</p> <footer> <cite>Claire Enders</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You can\u2019t become immune to Lyme \u2013 a lesson that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/10/interview-claire-enders-analyis\" title=\"\">leading media analyst Claire Enders</a> learned first-hand.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago, a few weeks after a family trip to the New Forest, I started to feel constantly nauseous and tired. A small red patch appeared on my ankle. I turned to the web for some answers, and Google turned up trumps: much to my horror, my symptoms matched some of those for the tick-borne bacterial infection Lyme disease. My GP was doubtful (we lived in London and I had not noticed any ticks on me) but agreed to a blood test. It came back positive so the rest of my family was tested. My husband and daughter also had it but, ironically, my son \u2013 on whom I had spotted a tick \u2013 did not. Lyme is like malaria in that you might get bitten by a mosquito but only some of them carry the disease. Warnings issued last week that Lyme is on the rise \u2013 and that the number of cases may be three times higher than estimated \u2013 are no surprise to me. When I got it, I was shocked to find how easily it could be transmitted, how unreliable testing for it was, and how awful the consequences were for those who didn\u2019t get the right diagnosis in time. My symptoms ruined our Christmas holiday and the antibiotics affected my daughter\u2019s health during school exams. But we were fortunate. I subsequently learned that of two others who contracted Lyme in the New Forest, one \u2013 a child \u2013 was affected neurologically. Given that the hosts for the New Forest ticks were deer, suffice to say, I no longer felt like crying at the film Bambi and \u2013 unpopular opinion alert \u2013 I began hoping people would view the deer in Richmond Park not through misty eyes but through sights on a rifle. (I was not alone. A letter to the Times last week asked: \u201cIf deer are deemed to be a significant threat to human health, and an increase in the cull is thought to be a reasonable solution, then why are we even hesitating?\u201d) But my research revealed deer to be only part of the problem: the unpalatable truth is that ticks are carried by other animals, including cats, dogs and birds. The International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society states: \u201cA patient\u2019s residence does not necessarily reflect his or her Lyme disease risk. People travel, pets travel and ticks travel. \u201cMigratory birds carry ticks over great distances,\u201d it adds. You can\u2019t become immune to Lyme \u2013 a lesson that leading media analyst Claire Enders learned first-hand. She has had Lyme twice, with the second bout going undiagnosed for a year as her test results gave a false negative. An eloquent businesswoman from a medical Nobel prize-winning US family, she became such an authority on the illness that when she told Jeremy Hunt the NHS website\u2019s Lyme guidance was inadequate, the then health secretary had it updated. Yet she had to work hard to convince her doctors she had it again: \u201cI was asked if I had a \u2018Daily Mail illness\u2019. It was demeaning. I felt devastated by the illness, so to be told it was in my head because the test was negative was awful.\u201d Enders was unable to walk and suffered nerve damage, but is thankfully better after an 18-month cycle of antibiotics and hydrotherapy. Language is important in raising awareness. She describes it as a \u201cclimate-change illness\u201d and says Lyme should be compared with tropical diseases, not flu: \u201cIt\u2019s a neural illness.\u201d Specialists say milder winters have increased the tick population, as fewer are being killed off by freezing weather. Enders points out, \u201cthis country is covered with woods and crawling with deer. People forget that birds get ticks, so do cats, dogs and other animals\u201d. She highlights how the US has dealt with the increase of Lyme \u2013 opening up special clinics where antibiotics are given out. UK doctors are more reluctant to prescribe antibiotics due to increased resistance, but Enders argues that, for her and most others, they are the only cure. Around 70% of her US family has had Lyme, and their estate is now sprayed to kill ticks after employees died from the disease. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has identified areas of the UK particularly at risk of the disease. They include the New Forest and Scottish Highlands where businessman Kenny Young got Lyme from ticks in the bracken. He was initially very tired but thought nothing of it until a rash appeared a few weeks later. \u201cLuckily, I knew enough about Lyme to figure it out,\u201d he said. \u201cMy doctor was in London and had never come across Lyme before.

The expensive issue the government needs to confront is the ticks themselves and the bacteria they pass on; more research is needed into this mysterious and complex illness.

      "bodyText": "In the late 1990s, when Frankie Dettori was already well-established as the biggest name in racing, he happened to be sitting at the next table to mine at the Lesters, an annual awards when, for one night only, Britain\u2019s jockeys let their hair down and party. Dinner was served, a waiter appeared to offer him a selection of vegetables and for several seconds Dettori cast a melancholic gaze at a tray of buttered new potatoes with a look that said much about the denial in a jockey\u2019s life. Fame, fortune and Classic winners are fine but for a moment he looked ready to give it all up for a plate of spuds. He certainly did not look like someone who would still be riding big-race winners at 48, and an extended career seemed more implausible still when he was banned from the saddle for six months in December 2012, having tested positive for cocaine after a ride in France. By then Dettori had already lost the retainer with Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s Godolphin operation that had guaranteed a steady supply of champions to ride for 20 years. He could look forward only to grubbing around in racing\u2019s undergrowth when he returned to action \u2013 if he returned to action at all. Seven years later Dettori is not only back at the pinnacle of his profession but quite possibly in the middle of the best season of his entire career. The glory years with Godolphin were good but at his current rate of progress never as good as this. In 2001 Dettori rode 16 Group One or Grade One winners. This season he has already bagged 11, with the biggest prizes of the campaign still to come. All sports offer up examples of champions and legends who competed well into their 30s or even their 40s. Stanley Matthews and WG Grace were still playing in their 50s. And no round-up of sporting veterans would be complete without a mention for Gordie Howe, who played ice hockey in the NHL across five different decades and was the originator of the \u201cGordie Howe Hat-Trick\u201d: a goal, an assist and a fight, all in the same game. Superstars, all of them. But how many sporting greats were at their very best, or even close, in their final years? And how many had a season in the twilight of their careers that not only matched but bettered anything that had gone before? Roger Federer remains a marvel, able to reach and almost win a Wimbledon men\u2019s final at 37, but he is never going to improve on his 2006 season, when he reached all four grand slam finals and won three. Dettori, though, is six Group One winners away from the best season of his life, 32 years after riding his first winner in June 1987.

De Bruyne\u2019s return is massive boost: he\u2019s an absolutely ridiculous footballer. At times, it can genuinely look as if he\u2019s playing a different sport to everyone else. And Foden is just too good not to get more game time this season. Keep an eye out, too, for Eric Garc\u00eda given our troubles at centre-half \u2013 which is the one gaping hole in an otherwise incredibly well-assembled squad. Letting a man of Kompany\u2019s stature leave without signing a replacement is baffling, especially given Laporte\u2019s injury. I appreciate there are few high quality options (Maguire was crazily overpriced) but it does feel we\u2019re taking a big unnecessary risk by going into the season with only three senior centre-halves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/04/football-transfer-window-2019-every-summer-deal-from-europe-top-five-leagues\">Transfer window 2019 \u2013 every summer deal from Europe's top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>We need to sign </strong>Alderweireld would have been ideal.

Pre-season has shown us he has a clear strategy of how he wants United to play, at least, with a high press creating space for the forwards. But I still can\u2019t see us coming higher than sixth again.</p> <p><strong>Key men/weak links </strong>We\u2019ve finally found a replacement for Gary Neville in Wan-Bissaka, who looks like he\u2019ll make an instant impact.

And our little Argentinian Emi Buendia is electric. Also look out for young Max Aarons, Jamal Lewis, Ben Godfrey and Todd Cantwell.

How can you not, given everything we\u2019ve seen from this manager and team in the last three years? We\u2019ll continue playing our front-foot football \u2013 get ready to hear the phrase \u201coverlapping centre-backs\u201d every time we\u2019re on TV \u2013 and being aggressive in trying to win games rather than hanging on for a point. We\u2019ve also added several pacey, skilful attackers in this window.</p> <p><strong>Key men/weak links </strong>Jack O\u2019Connell\u2019s defensive brilliance and marauding runs from centre-back will be vital; David McGoldrick\u2019s skill and movement helps to knit everything together, and as for Billy Sharp \u2026 he just scores goals.

Couple that with the continuity provided by a manager entering his sixth year and a talented squad largely intact and injury-free, Spurs are in a good place \u2013 especially if Eriksen stays. It would be a disappointment if we\u2019re not challenging for silverware again.</p> <p><strong>Key men/weak links </strong>Home-grown Harrys. While the myth that Spurs are dependent on Kane has been well and truly debunked, there\u2019s no doubt his all-round play, goals and leadership are central to our identity. And the underrated Duracell bunny-like Winks is the heartbeat of the side at its best. Also watch out for progress from Oliver Skipp, Troy Parrott and Japhet Tanganga. Weak links? Both full-back positions. On the right Juan Foyth could be given an extended run, ahead of the (erratic) Serge Aurier and Kyle Walker-Peters after Keiran Trippier\u2019s departure. Ben Davies is reliable on the left but Spurs need a more dynamic option with Danny Rose\u2019s tenure uncertain. And we may have seen the best of Wanyama.</p> <p><strong>We need to sign </strong>Fulham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon would bolster the left-hand side of defence and Giovanni Lo Celso of Real Betis is another likely incomer.</p> <p><strong>Headline maker </strong>After Lloris\u2019s out-of-character <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/12/hugo-lloris-drink-drive-twice-limit\">drink-drive incident</a> last season, expect the unexpected.

We have a splendid, likeable team with plenty of options, a smart, down to earth coach and an extraordinarily well-run club. Slipping into the bottom half at the death last season was aggravating, but as a result we\u2019re not bundled in with Wolves, Leicester and Everton in accounts of \u201cthe chasing pack\u201d. Which might be no bad thing, coming up on the blind side. Because we <em>are </em>in that chasing pack.</p> <p><strong>Key men/weak links </strong>Testimony to the club\u2019s success is the ability to identify and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 attract Isma\u00efla Sarr after a two-year pursuit, and Tom Dele-Bashiru\u2019s decision to turn down a new deal at Man City to join us on a six-year contract (henceforth a \u201creverse Sancho\u201d).

Add those two to Anderson, Lanzini, Rice, Antonio and a fit-again Yarmolenko and we should be a real attacking force.

It\u2019ll also be exciting to see Anderson combine with Fornals. Rice will be the key defensive midfielder and Diop will be vital in defence.

Young playwright Ben Johnson could make a breakthough at full back, with the left-back slot a bit of a problem: Masuaku and Cresswell are OK going forward, but have struggled defensively.

      "bodyText": "Manchester City As long as Pep is manager I\u2019ll stay wildly optimistic. I\u2019m confident we can win the league for the third season in a row and cement this team\u2019s reputation as the best of the Premier League era. Key men/weak links De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva were the standout players from our last two title-winning seasons. De Bruyne\u2019s return is massive boost: he\u2019s an absolutely ridiculous footballer. At times, it can genuinely look as if he\u2019s playing a different sport to everyone else. And Foden is just too good not to get more game time this season. Keep an eye out, too, for Eric Garc\u00eda given our troubles at centre-half \u2013 which is the one gaping hole in an otherwise incredibly well-assembled squad. Letting a man of Kompany\u2019s stature leave without signing a replacement is baffling, especially given Laporte\u2019s injury. I appreciate there are few high quality options (Maguire was crazily overpriced) but it does feel we\u2019re taking a big unnecessary risk by going into the season with only three senior centre-halves. We need to sign Alderweireld would have been ideal. And if we allow San\u00e9 to leave without signing a replacement, suddenly we\u2019re short in two positions. Headline maker Benjamin Mendy, particularly now he\u2019s back on social media. Hopefully, he\u2019ll be back out on the pitch soon, too. Though, given journalists\u2019 interest in our ownership and Abu Dhabi, there\u2019s every chance they could garner the most headlines. VAR: good or bad? Referees clearly need help but the system is far from perfect. At least, from a selfish point of view, City (and Sterling in particular) should win a lot more penalties. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 1st. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Sheffield Utd; 19. Burnley; 20. Crystal Palace. First manager sacked: Roy Hodgson. \u2022 Lloyd Scragg ninetythreetwenty.com @lloyd_scragg Manchester United The slump at the end of last season was pretty embarrassing. Ole said then there were players who had played their last game for the club but he can\u2019t shift them due to their inflated salaries. The result is a bloated mess of a squad. Pre-season has shown us he has a clear strategy of how he wants United to play, at least, with a high press creating space for the forwards. But I still can\u2019t see us coming higher than sixth again. Key men/weak links We\u2019ve finally found a replacement for Gary Neville in Wan-Bissaka, who looks like he\u2019ll make an instant impact. And, especially if Lukaku isn\u2019t replaced by a new signing, Mason Greenwood could break through. He\u2019s such a natural talent. We need to sign So much still needs to happen. In an ideal world I\u2019d swap Pogba for Verratti from PSG, Lukaku for Dybala, and, after finally landing Maguire, if we can add Maddison from Leicester too then job\u2019s a good \u2019un! Headline maker Unless he goes, the Pogba circus will roll on. VAR: good or bad? I\u2019m against it. There\u2019s enough interference already. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 6th. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Brighton; 19. Norwich; 20. Sheffield United. First manager sacked: Steve Bruce. \u2022 Shaun O\u2019Donnell Observer reader Newcastle We were actually optimistic after the final whistle of last season, when we\u2019d just beaten Fulham 4-0 and Rafa was in the dugout. But with the best manager we\u2019ve had in years gone, along with leading scorers Rond\u00f3n and P\u00e9rez (and seemingly any hope of a takeover) we\u2019re set for another relegation battle. This time, though, it will be with a \u201chead coach\u201d who seems better suited to the Championship. Key men/weak links There\u2019s a lot of pressure on record signings Joelinton and Almir\u00f3n to score and it\u2019s essential that defenders Sch\u00e4r and Lejeune give us a solid platform. Bruce\u2019s appointment also represents a second chance for Jonjo Shelvey. It\u2019ll be a big season, too, for rising star Sean Longstaff (and perhaps his brother Matty) so long as Ashley doesn\u2019t decide to cash in\u2026 We need to sign A minimum of two proven scorers, plus cover at full-back. Headline maker There\u2019s only one candidate. The next classless Ashley gaff and resultant eruption of fan hostility is always just round the corner. VAR: good or bad? Relegations and livelihoods can hinge on a refereeing error, so it\u2019s not before time. Though it\u2019ll be a shame if it disrupts the flow. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 16th. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Brighton; 19. Southampton; 20. Aston Villa. First manager sacked: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. \u2022 David and Richard Holmes Observer readers Norwich We\u2019re optimistic. Most outside Norfolk have us down as absolute certs for relegation but if we can use our momentum and adapt our pleasing-on-the-eye style for the brutalities of the top flight, we\u2019ll do OK. We still feel like unwelcome guests at a swish party, though. Key men/weak links Pukki ripped up the Championship and we\u2019re obviously hoping that will continue. And our little Argentinian Emi Buendia is electric. Also look out for young Max Aarons, Jamal Lewis, Ben Godfrey and Todd Cantwell. As for weak links: our style of play, both full-backs pushing on, can leave our defence exposed and will need adapting. We\u2019re not what you\u2019d called water-tight and so, while I wouldn\u2019t single out any individuals as weak links, as a defensive unit we\u2019re vulnerable at times. We need to sign Our budget is the division\u2019s smallest, so we\u2019ve had to be creative. We\u2019re still after a defensive midfielder, though. Headline maker It\u2019s too obvious to say Delia but she and her husband have been known to blurt. Wouldn\u2019t be without them, though. And Daniel Farke, all charm and charisma, can deliver a great one-liner. VAR: good or bad? I like the principle but there are definite refinements needed. It was horribly overused at the women\u2019s World Cup. \u201cClear and obvious\u201d has to be the overriding theme, and it needs to assist the referee rather than make the decisions for them. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 15th. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. Man United. Bottom three: 18. Newcastle; 19. Sheffield United; 20. Brighton. First manager sacked: Steve Bruce. \u2022 Gary Gowers norwichcity.myfootballwriter.com @gary_gowers Sheffield United We\u2019ll be everyone\u2019s pick to go back down, but I\u2019m confident and looking forward to the challenge. How can you not, given everything we\u2019ve seen from this manager and team in the last three years? We\u2019ll continue playing our front-foot football \u2013 get ready to hear the phrase \u201coverlapping centre-backs\u201d every time we\u2019re on TV \u2013 and being aggressive in trying to win games rather than hanging on for a point. We\u2019ve also added several pacey, skilful attackers in this window. Key men/weak links Jack O\u2019Connell\u2019s defensive brilliance and marauding runs from centre-back will be vital; David McGoldrick\u2019s skill and movement helps to knit everything together, and as for Billy Sharp \u2026 he just scores goals. New signings Callum Robinson and Oli McBurnie also look like they\u2019ll have a big impact. We need to sign With McBurnie\u2019s arrival we\u2019re well set in attack. Add in a defensive midfielder and someone with the athleticism and skill to challenge Chris Basham at centre-back and that\u2019s the perfect window. Headline maker Chris Wilder\u2019s brutal honesty might shock a few neutrals. VAR: good or bad? The women\u2019s World Cup was worrying, to say the least. I don\u2019t like matches being altered because someone\u2019s big toe was offside or a defender\u2019s arm was in the way of an 80mph shot from three yards away. Are we just making football worse rather than better? Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 16th (safe with a game to spare). Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Brighton; 19. Norwich; 20. Newcastle. First manager sacked: Steve Bruce. Ben Meakin uptheblades.com @bladespod Southampton I\u2019m relatively confident we won\u2019t be in as much danger as last season. We have a manager everyone (except perhaps Charlie Austin) believes in and we\u2019re looking pretty sharp. There are still a few concerns defensively but it\u2019s going to take a while to undo the last three years\u2019 poor recruitment decisions. Key men/weak links Che Adams looks a good fit up front; our full-backs will provide width; and Nathan Redmond will look to maintain last season\u2019s Player of the Year form. It could be a big season for Jake Vokins, too. We need to sign An imposing holding midfielder to give our creaking defence more protection. Oriol Romeu has done a decent job there but he\u2019s still not a patch on Victor Wanyama or Morgan Schneiderlin. When we were good we won games in midfield and we haven\u2019t been doing that for a while now. Headline maker Austin and Mario Lemina could cause a few issues. There\u2019s a training ground bust-up waiting to happen there. VAR: good or bad? I\u2019m an unashamed VAR fan and think it will go some way to redressing the unconscious bias in referees\u2019 decisions when they\u2019re dealing with smaller clubs. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 12th, at least double figures above the bottom three. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Newcastle; 19. Brighton; 20. Sheffield United. First manager sacked: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. Steve Grant Total Saints Podcast @SteveGrant1983 Tottenham With the stadium finally done, a proper pre-season and the novelty of a signing or two, this feels like a new chapter. Couple that with the continuity provided by a manager entering his sixth year and a talented squad largely intact and injury-free, Spurs are in a good place \u2013 especially if Eriksen stays. It would be a disappointment if we\u2019re not challenging for silverware again. Key men/weak links Home-grown Harrys. While the myth that Spurs are dependent on Kane has been well and truly debunked, there\u2019s no doubt his all-round play, goals and leadership are central to our identity. And the underrated Duracell bunny-like Winks is the heartbeat of the side at its best. Also watch out for progress from Oliver Skipp, Troy Parrott and Japhet Tanganga. Weak links? Both full-back positions. On the right Juan Foyth could be given an extended run, ahead of the (erratic) Serge Aurier and Kyle Walker-Peters after Keiran Trippier\u2019s departure. Ben Davies is reliable on the left but Spurs need a more dynamic option with Danny Rose\u2019s tenure uncertain. And we may have seen the best of Wanyama. We need to sign Fulham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon would bolster the left-hand side of defence and Giovanni Lo Celso of Real Betis is another likely incomer. Headline maker After Lloris\u2019s out-of-character drink-drive incident last season, expect the unexpected. Meanwhile, Daniel Levy\u2019s refusal to pay over the odds for players continues to annoy elements of the fan base, when inflated ticket prices should be of more concern. VAR: good or bad? Spurs were involved in what was possibly VAR\u2019s nadir, an FA Cup tie at a snowy Wembley against Rochdale in February 2018 that, as Pochettino said, was \u201ca bit of an embarrassment\u201d. Thankfully things have improved since then, and so long as it evolves in a common sense fashion, it\u2019s a good thing. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 1st (The manager\u2019s watchword is \u201cbelieve\u201d after all). Top four: 1. Tottenham; 2. Man City; 3. Liverpool; 4. Man United. Bottom three: 18. Newcastle; 19. Brighton; 20. Sheffield Utd. First manager sacked: Roy Hodgson. \u2022 Richard Barnes @barnesrichard Watford We\u2019ll do just fine. We have a splendid, likeable team with plenty of options, a smart, down to earth coach and an extraordinarily well-run club. Slipping into the bottom half at the death last season was aggravating, but as a result we\u2019re not bundled in with Wolves, Leicester and Everton in accounts of \u201cthe chasing pack\u201d. Which might be no bad thing, coming up on the blind side. Because we are in that chasing pack. Key men/weak links Testimony to the club\u2019s success is the ability to identify and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 attract Isma\u00efla Sarr after a two-year pursuit, and Tom Dele-Bashiru\u2019s decision to turn down a new deal at Man City to join us on a six-year contract (henceforth a \u201creverse Sancho\u201d). Troy Deeney remains key as a leader and figurehead but we increasingly have strong cover across the pitch and a small army of promising kids pushing for inclusion, albeit from some geographical distance. We need to sign I\u2019d be happy as we are. Headline maker Troy, always. VAR: good or bad? A grotesque short-sightedness borne of an easily manipulated tendency for everyone to think that the world is somehow biased against them and it\u2019s all someone else\u2019s fault. A convenient panacea, a magic bullet presented with the consequence that multiple babies get thrown out with bath water. And VAR will be dreadful, too. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: Top half. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. One of seven. Bottom three: 18. Newcastle; 19. Sheffield United; 20. Brighton. First manager sacked: Marco Silva. \u2022 Matt Rowson BHappy.wordpress.com @mattrowson West Ham Unusually, most Irons fans are feeling cautiously optimistic. Pellegrini has made a couple of statement signings in \u00a324m Fornals \u2013 the sort of playmaker fans should love \u2013 and \u00a345m striker Haller. Add those two to Anderson, Lanzini, Rice, Antonio and a fit-again Yarmolenko and we should be a real attacking force. Several stale squad players have been shifted and even Jack Wilshere is currently fit. So we can hope to improve on last season\u2019s 10th. Key men/weak links Much will depend on how Haller settles. It\u2019ll also be exciting to see Anderson combine with Fornals. Rice will be the key defensive midfielder and Diop will be vital in defence. The biggest problem will be fitting so many attacking midfielders into the team. Young playwright Ben Johnson could make a breakthough at full back, with the left-back slot a bit of a problem: Masuaku and Cresswell are OK going forward, but have struggled defensively. Fabianski had a great season last time, but his form covered-up a lot of frailties in front of him. We need to sign A couple of squad full-backs and a centre-back would be useful. And an understudy for Rice. Headline maker David Sullivan will inevitably say something indiscreet, and Michail Antonio is bound to do a silly celebration. VAR: good or bad? Generally good, but, as there\u2019s a worldwide conspiracy against West Ham, VAR will inevitably rob us in a vital cup semi-final/Europa League clincher/relegation decider. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: 8th. Top four: 1. Liverpool; 2. Man City; 3. Chelsea; 4. Arsenal. Bottom three: 18. Brighton; 19. Norwich; 20. Sheffield United. First manager sacked: Graham Potter. \u2022 Pete May Author of Goodbye to Boleyn hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk Wolves It\u2019s going to be difficult to repeat last season\u2019s seventh-place finish, given the (hopefully) busy schedule Europe may bring \u2013 but with Nuno in charge, anything\u2019s possible. If we can keep our relatively small squad fresh we will be in and around that position again. Key men/weak links He struggled in the first half of the season but with a slight change in position Diogo Jota showed what every Wolves fan knew he was capable of. He\u2019s a match-winner and defenders must hate facing him. Jo\u00e3o Moutinho\u2019s experience will be key again, while youngsters Morgan Gibbs-White and R\u00faben Vinagre should benefit from our increased fixture list. We need to sign A creative spark who can help us break down teams who set up to defend deep. We\u2019ve been linked with Dani Olmo - the type of name that fits in with our recruitment approach. Headline maker Expect more questions about our links with agent Jorge Mendes. VAR: good or bad? The official line is that VAR should impose minimum disruption. It\u2019ll take some getting used to but, if that\u2019s how it works, I think it\u2019ll be beneficial to the game overall. Predictions\u2026 We will finish: Top 10. Top four: 1. Man City; 2. Liverpool; 3. Tottenham; 4. Arsenal. Bottom three: 18. Crystal Palace; 19. Newcastle; 20. Sheffield United.

      "body": "<p>It sometimes seems like the world is not quite designed for children. Even the pavements of Hackney, one of the more child-friendly parts of God\u2019s green earth, are beset by pram-height pratfalls. I speak not merely of the snarling traffic and caustic fumes, but the scaffolds jutting out at satanic angles, as if designed by devious opticians hoping to drum up business by scarring the eyes of passing infants.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A pub landlord in Bristol drew criticism for suggesting children remained stationary and silent in his establishment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet a growingly vocal number of people appear to find their lives impeded by all the tiny, screaming dictators littering their public spaces. Earlier this month a pub landlord in Bristol drew <a href=\"https://www.heart.co.uk/lifestyle/parenting/outrage-pub-landlord-ban-children/\" title=\"\">criticism</a> for suggesting children remained stationary and silent in his establishment. (How would this be enforced, gags? Straitjackets?) In response, an <em>Irish Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/children-have-poisoned-the-restaurant-experience-1.3954115\" title=\"\">article</a> last week claimed children had \u2018poisoned the restaurant experience\u2019 and advocated, albeit tongue-in-cheek, a total ban. This drew bitter rebukes from parents and non-parents alike. But, in the real world, most parents I know are happy for child-free spaces to exist, not least because on those rare moments they can grab dinner or a drink without their kids in tow, they would probably choose those spaces in a heartbeat.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve internalised some sort of anti-child prejudice. I understand that I have every right to look after my son in public and his potential for alarming volume shouldn\u2019t bar me from eating with him. It\u2019s just that, when he starts performing that wonderful magic trick where lungs the size of tea bags generate the sound of an industrial angle grinder, I think other people have a right to not find it immensely charming. I mean, I certainly don\u2019t, and I love the little guy.</p> <p>If there is a spectrum of tolerance for screaming, I just happen to be on its lower end. Before my son arrived, I was told my attitude to crying babies would change, and I\u2019d suddenly have a fresh new wellspring of understanding. To some extent, this is true. In trapped spaces, planes, buses, air raid bunkers and the like, I possess a compassion that did not previously exist, because I\u2019ve been there, too. But, even then, my reptile brain would still prefer to be listening to nails on a blackboard. </p> <p>In any case, I can\u2019t help but find the whole debate a little disingenuous, since parents are acutely aware of the discomfort that loud or free-roaming kids can create, especially when their beloved turns a public space into their own personal primal scream therapy cell. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s a middle ground somewhere between acknowledging that fact and stapling them to their chairs with gags on their mouths. Save a space for us somewhere. Unruly infants shouldn\u2019t rule the world, but they are still part of it.</p> <p><em>Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "It sometimes seems like the world is not quite designed for children. Even the pavements of Hackney, one of the more child-friendly parts of God\u2019s green earth, are beset by pram-height pratfalls. I speak not merely of the snarling traffic and caustic fumes, but the scaffolds jutting out at satanic angles, as if designed by devious opticians hoping to drum up business by scarring the eyes of passing infants. Yet a growingly vocal number of people appear to find their lives impeded by all the tiny, screaming dictators littering their public spaces. Earlier this month a pub landlord in Bristol drew criticism for suggesting children remained stationary and silent in his establishment. (How would this be enforced, gags? Straitjackets?) In response, an Irish Times article last week claimed children had \u2018poisoned the restaurant experience\u2019 and advocated, albeit tongue-in-cheek, a total ban. This drew bitter rebukes from parents and non-parents alike. But, in the real world, most parents I know are happy for child-free spaces to exist, not least because on those rare moments they can grab dinner or a drink without their kids in tow, they would probably choose those spaces in a heartbeat. It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve internalised some sort of anti-child prejudice. I understand that I have every right to look after my son in public and his potential for alarming volume shouldn\u2019t bar me from eating with him. It\u2019s just that, when he starts performing that wonderful magic trick where lungs the size of tea bags generate the sound of an industrial angle grinder, I think other people have a right to not find it immensely charming. I mean, I certainly don\u2019t, and I love the little guy. If there is a spectrum of tolerance for screaming, I just happen to be on its lower end. Before my son arrived, I was told my attitude to crying babies would change, and I\u2019d suddenly have a fresh new wellspring of understanding. To some extent, this is true. In trapped spaces, planes, buses, air raid bunkers and the like, I possess a compassion that did not previously exist, because I\u2019ve been there, too. But, even then, my reptile brain would still prefer to be listening to nails on a blackboard. In any case, I can\u2019t help but find the whole debate a little disingenuous, since parents are acutely aware of the discomfort that loud or free-roaming kids can create, especially when their beloved turns a public space into their own personal primal scream therapy cell. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s a middle ground somewhere between acknowledging that fact and stapling them to their chairs with gags on their mouths. Save a space for us somewhere. Unruly infants shouldn\u2019t rule the world, but they are still part of it. Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

Rafi (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is a struggling street photographer at Mumbai\u2019s Gateway of India monument whose grandmother Dadi (an extremely lively Farrukh Jaffar) is refusing to take her medicine until he find himself a bride. At the Gateway, Rafi snaps a photograph of a shy accounting student called Miloni (Sanya Malhotra), and then sends it to Dadi to shut her up; naturally, Dadi travels to Mumbai to see for herself. A chaste romance blossoms between Rafi and Miloni once he tracks her down, but Malhotra\u2019s performance is too understated to convince that she is more than a blank slate for him to project his fantasies on to.",

A pitiless study of a trophy girlfriend joining the \u201cfamily\u201d of her drug kingpin boyfriend at his villa on the Turkish Riviera, <em>Holiday</em> makes the worlds of Michael Haneke look cuddly and inviting, the work of Ulrich Seidl seem positively jolly. Captured by a cautious camera that maintains a dispassionate distance, Ekl\u00f6f\u2019s characters are observed in the same way that a nature documentary studies the jostling for status in a particularly savage group of pack animals. Violence \u2013 sexual, physical and psychological \u2013 is a fact of life in this ecosystem.</p> <p>It\u2019s the film\u2019s unflinching approach to its steely core of violence and power-play, in particular a harrowing, nearly unwatchable rape scene, which makes it such gruelling viewing at times. In a director\u2019s statement, Ekl\u00f6f, who co-wrote the film with actress and screenwriter Johanne Algren, said: \u201cI always aim to be ruthless in telling a story... to not look away from the rawest, most vulnerable parts.\u201d I have watched <em>Holiday</em> three times now, and while I admired it more with each viewing, it doesn\u2019t get any easier.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is Sascha complicit in her own commodification? She\u2019s canny enough to be tallying a continual cost-benefit analysis</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the role of Sascha, Victoria Carmen Sonne aims for honesty in the performance over engendering empathy. She\u2019s a difficult character to warm to: shallow, venal, watchful, Sascha is mindful of her precarious status as the \u201cnew girl\u201d of gangster Michael (Lai Yde). We get the sense that there have been many before her. She drifts on the periphery of his circle of hangers-on: the dumb muscle, the crowing yes men and the brash blond molls. The only time she becomes fully engaged and animated is when she locks eyes with herself in the mirror, trying out come-hither pouts on her reflection.</p> <p>Her boyfriend is a capricious ruler over a fiefdom of clowns and jesters; his moods dictate the atmosphere in the villa. Woe betide anyone who misreads them. Sascha quickly learns to sense the warning signs. But hers is a world in which everything has a price tag. And Sascha\u2019s self-worth is measured in male appreciation. When Michael withdraws his attention, she drapes herself hopefully over his turned back, then temporarily transfers her focus and basks in a flirtation with Thomas (Thijs R\u00f6mer), a Dutch man with a boat in the nearby harbour. Michael, however, is the kind of boy who would rather break his toys than share them.</p> <p>There\u2019s no question that Michael views Sascha as one of his many possessions, an object that can be replaced if it no longer pleases. A detail that is almost as chilling as the sexual attack that follows is the way he carefully removes his expensive watch beforehand. Priorities. What\u2019s more complicated is the question of how Sascha sees herself. Is she complicit in her own commodification? Certainly she\u2019s canny enough to be tallying a continual cost-benefit analysis; the unwitting Thomas is her escape route if the price of her lifestyle gets too high.</p> <p>One of the strongest elements of a film that represents a fiercely uncompromising directorial vision throughout is Ekl\u00f6f\u2019s choice of locations. The airport arrivals hall, the interior of Michael\u2019s holiday pad, the brash resort clubs: all have the veneer of glossy luxury that evokes the kind of boutique where the ultra-wealthy flex their money.</p> <p>Particularly effective is the film\u2019s main backdrop: the hollow-eyed villa, painted the ominous white of a sun-bleached skull. It\u2019s open plan, the better to let the sounds out of frame bleed through the space. In one scene, Sascha sits with the gangsters\u2019 semi-feral kids watching cartoons, barely registering the howls from the basement where Musse, a low-level thug, takes punishment for a transgression. Later, Musse, his teeth bared in a craven grin of appeasement, offers gifts to buy himself back into favour. Head bowed, he proffers a bottle of Turkish brandy to a man whose knuckles are still scabbed from beating him.</p> <p>There\u2019s a sickly inevitability in the build of violent tension. But what\u2019s more unexpected is how, having chosen her path in the most savage way imaginable, Sascha\u2019s status within the gang subtly shifts. She has clawed herself a slice of power and found it every bit as addictive as Michael\u2019s drugs. Meanwhile, Ekl\u00f6f establishes herself as a ferocious talent. I await her next film with as much trepidation as anticipation.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo2oqWNE4gQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lo2oqWNE4gQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo2oqWNE4gQ\">Watch a trailer for Holiday.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

In a director\u2019s statement, Ekl\u00f6f, who co-wrote the film with actress and screenwriter Johanne Algren, said: \u201cI always aim to be ruthless in telling a story... to not look away from the rawest, most vulnerable parts.\u201d I have watched Holiday three times now, and while I admired it more with each viewing, it doesn\u2019t get any easier. In the role of Sascha, Victoria Carmen Sonne aims for honesty in the performance over engendering empathy. She\u2019s a difficult character to warm to: shallow, venal, watchful, Sascha is mindful of her precarious status as the \u201cnew girl\u201d of gangster Michael (Lai Yde). We get the sense that there have been many before her. She drifts on the periphery of his circle of hangers-on: the dumb muscle, the crowing yes men and the brash blond molls. The only time she becomes fully engaged and animated is when she locks eyes with herself in the mirror, trying out come-hither pouts on her reflection. Her boyfriend is a capricious ruler over a fiefdom of clowns and jesters; his moods dictate the atmosphere in the villa. Woe betide anyone who misreads them. Sascha quickly learns to sense the warning signs. But hers is a world in which everything has a price tag. And Sascha\u2019s self-worth is measured in male appreciation. When Michael withdraws his attention, she drapes herself hopefully over his turned back, then temporarily transfers her focus and basks in a flirtation with Thomas (Thijs R\u00f6mer), a Dutch man with a boat in the nearby harbour. Michael, however, is the kind of boy who would rather break his toys than share them. There\u2019s no question that Michael views Sascha as one of his many possessions, an object that can be replaced if it no longer pleases. A detail that is almost as chilling as the sexual attack that follows is the way he carefully removes his expensive watch beforehand. Priorities. What\u2019s more complicated is the question of how Sascha sees herself. Is she complicit in her own commodification? Certainly she\u2019s canny enough to be tallying a continual cost-benefit analysis; the unwitting Thomas is her escape route if the price of her lifestyle gets too high. One of the strongest elements of a film that represents a fiercely uncompromising directorial vision throughout is Ekl\u00f6f\u2019s choice of locations. The airport arrivals hall, the interior of Michael\u2019s holiday pad, the brash resort clubs: all have the veneer of glossy luxury that evokes the kind of boutique where the ultra-wealthy flex their money. Particularly effective is the film\u2019s main backdrop: the hollow-eyed villa, painted the ominous white of a sun-bleached skull. It\u2019s open plan, the better to let the sounds out of frame bleed through the space. In one scene, Sascha sits with the gangsters\u2019 semi-feral kids watching cartoons, barely registering the howls from the basement where Musse, a low-level thug, takes punishment for a transgression. Later, Musse, his teeth bared in a craven grin of appeasement, offers gifts to buy himself back into favour. Head bowed, he proffers a bottle of Turkish brandy to a man whose knuckles are still scabbed from beating him. There\u2019s a sickly inevitability in the build of violent tension. But what\u2019s more unexpected is how, having chosen her path in the most savage way imaginable, Sascha\u2019s status within the gang subtly shifts. She has clawed herself a slice of power and found it every bit as addictive as Michael\u2019s drugs. Meanwhile, Ekl\u00f6f establishes herself as a ferocious talent. I await her next film with as much trepidation as anticipation.",

Dad was a travelling furniture salesman in the 1980s, a job that served him well in the years before globalisation hobbled the Canadian manufacturing sector.

There wasn\u2019t much on it \u2013 synthetic upholstery swatches, a mug of pens, a lamp, a phone, an ashtray. And yet every day Dad spent hours there, making notes, smoking Craven \u201cA\u201ds, drinking coffee and yakking affably to small-town retailers about shipments of sectional sofas and dinette sets. This is what I find so amazing. That my father \u2013 like most other professionals of his generation and generations before him \u2013 was able to earn a salary and support our family with little more than a phone and a stack of papers.

There will be records, of course (stored in the intangibly limitless archive of the cloud), but the actual lived experience of what it was like to think and feel and be human before the emergence of big data will be gone. When that happens, what will be lost?</p> <p><em><strong>Earlier this year</strong></em> I travelled to Wilmslow, a suburb of greater Manchester, to interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/15/elizabeth-denham-data-protection-information-commissioner-facebook-cambridge-analytica\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Denham</a>, the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner and arguably the most empowered data regulator on the planet. Our discussion was wide-ranging, but among the ICO\u2019s projects she was most enthusiastic about was the <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/ico-and-stakeholder-consultations/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/\" title=\"\">Age Appropriate Design</a> Code, or Kids\u2019 Code for short, currently in public consultation. An extrapolation of last year\u2019s Data Protection Act, the new code was devised over several months by a tech child welfare dream team composed of the filmmaker Baroness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/beeban-kidron\" title=\"\">Beeban Kidron</a>, children\u2019s commissioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/mar/29/anne-longfield-childrens-champion-or-not\" title=\"\">Anne Longfield</a> and then minister for digital and creative industries Margot James.</p> <p>The code, which is expected to be laid before parliament this autumn, would completely revolutionise the digital landscape for British children.

Another name for us, coined by the Vancouver writer Michael Harris in his book <em>The End of Absence</em>, is \u201cdigital immigrants,\u201d which he defines as those who have lived both \u201cwith and without the crowded connectivity of online life.\u201d</p> <p>Denham\u2019s Kids\u2019 Code is an audacious act \u2013 a radical new set of rules that would reimagine the internet as a garden of creativity and knowledge for children, rather than the chaotic circus of unregulated content and dubious corporate interests that characterise its current state. The optimism and daring ambition of her project suggests a question I didn\u2019t think to ask until I was already on the train back from Wilmslow: is it possible to regain innocence lost?</p> <p><em><strong>For weeks after</strong></em> meeting Denham, I found myself haunted by the notion of digital immigration and what it means for my generation. I\u2019d always assumed that not being connected as a child had been a handicap \u2013 surely it explained why I\u2019m hopeless at figuring out the smart TV remote or programming the digital thermostat. Like most kids I spent idle summer days drifting around our garden spying faces in the clouds, but my childhood (like most kids in the 80s) was also awash in cultural drek. I had way more weekly screen time than my own kids, most of it spent zoning out on bad sitcom reruns and mind-numbing hours playing Pac-Man on our Commodore 64 so our mum \u2013 a housewife with no domestic help \u2013 could get the next meal on the table. Surely bingeing on the brilliance of Pixar films and the architectural complexities of Minecraft today is a superior way for a child to spend a rainy afternoon?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89e9e4f4b25cb3363eefb2b3322e93d183c9e68c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89e9e4f4b25cb3363eefb2b3322e93d183c9e68c/48_38_1368_2152/636.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of a heap of digital symbols with the back of a figure of a woman standing and looking up to the blue sky\" width=\"636\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dividing line: \u2018digital immigrants\u2019 have lived both \u2018with and without online life\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nathalie Lees</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I began to investigate what it was that marked my generation out \u2013 what was the \u201cinnocence\u201d lost, if any? I was surprised then to discover many of the neuroscientists, cyber-psychologists and tech ethicists who spend their lives pondering the cultural and moral ramifications of the digital revolution have come to believe that there is something special in my generation, and the recollection of our shared analogue past.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that digital immigrants are smarter or more talented than the digital natives that came after us. Our uniqueness, it seems, lies in the fact that we are the last of a dying breed and as such, living, breathing receptacles of a soon-to-be lost plane of human experience: empty yawning hours and days of nothing much at all.</p> <p><em><strong>\u201cWhich would you</strong></em> rather be, extremely poor with loads of friends or super rich with no friends at all?\u201d This hypothetical question was put to me recently out of nowhere by my 11-year-old stepson. For me the answer was easy. \u201cPoor with friends,\u201d I said. \u201cIn the long run, loneliness would be worse than poverty.\u201d</p> <p>My stepson disagreed. \u201cDefo rich with no friends. I\u2019d just stay in my mansion and play Fortnite and watch YouTube and hang out with people online.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s a popular kid and part of a close-knit group of boys who\u2019ve been friends since starting school. When offered a choice of whether they\u2019d like to watch a movie together or spend two hours playing Fortnite and interfacing remotely on headsets, the lads didn\u2019t miss a beat in choosing the latter. This is because, for digital natives like my stepson and his mates, socialising online is the same as \u2013 at times even preferable to \u2013 socialising in person.</p> <p>For his 11th birthday he got his first smart phone and it was as if we\u2019d handed him the keys to a magic portal to an idealised parallel universe. I suppose in a way we had. Just as puberty begins to set in, we\u2019d given him a comfort innocents like me and my husband had never known as alienated adolescents: the feeling of being with friends all the time. The absence of aloneness.</p> <p><em><strong>For years, scientific</strong></em> debate has raged over whether or not sustained internet use has a deleterious effect on human brain function \u2013 particularly on the developing brains of children. The never-ending \u201cscreentime debate\u201d has, historically, been heavy on conjecture and light on hard data. But this spring the results of a sweeping international <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20617\" title=\"\">study</a> were published in <em>World Psychiatry</em>, a respected international journal, which may have tipped the balance in favour of digital sceptics. An international team of researchers working with large sample groups in two separate methodologies (MRI brain imaging and behavioural observation), consistently found compelling evidence that prolonged internet use produces both \u201cacute and sustained alterations in specific areas of cognition,\u201d which may reflect long-term changes in the brain, affecting attention span, memory and social interactions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was in those lost hours that we really got to know ourselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr Joseph Firth, the Manchester-born neuroscientist who led the study told me that while the human brain does seem to interpret online socialising and connection in much the same way as the in-person variety (great news for friendless super-rich shut-ins), other cognitive functions are shown to be weakened. For instance, he said, the brain adapts fairly quickly to treating the internet as a kind of outsourced memory bank, which results over time in the reduction of our own \u201ctransactive memory function,\u201d ie the mental sorting processes the brain performs in order to locate and grasp a fact or mental image.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem with the internet,\u201d Firth explained, \u201cis that our brains seem to quickly figure out it\u2019s there \u2013 and outsource.\u201d This would be fine if we could rely on the internet for information the same way we rely on, say, the British Library. But what happens when we subconsciously outsource a complex cognitive function to an unreliable online world manipulated by capitalist interests and agents of distortion? \u201cWhat happens to children born in a world where transactive memory is no longer as widely exercised as a cognitive function?\u201d he asked.</p> <p><em><strong>James Williams,</strong></em> a former Google strategist-turned Oxford-trained philosopher and digital ethicist is convinced the loss of solitude we are now experiencing is more than just an end of innocence. His book, <em>Stand </em><em>Out of our Light</em>, outlines the moral danger of the current \u201cattention economy\u201d in which capitalist interests vie constantly to distract us for their own enrichment. Williams told me that unless we find better ways to regulate and interact with the pernicious distractions of big tech, we risk compromising our personal and collective goals and values, even imperilling our own free will.</p> <p>\u201cIf what we attend to is, in a very real sense, what we are, then what\u2019s at stake in the battle for our attention is nothing less than our ability to determine and pursue the kinds of lives we want to live, both individually and societally,\u201d he said. As someone who, like me, grew up in a world without the internet, Williams worries that we will continue to \u201cconflate entertainment with leisure, resulting in fewer and fewer opportunities for reflection and introspection.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e40046676d1e1b6ada5888c8ce8e3372271d41b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e40046676d1e1b6ada5888c8ce8e3372271d41b1/84_47_1355_2189/619.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of a woman in a sailing boat riding a steep wave of digital symbols\" width=\"619\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riding the wave: \u2018no amount of legislating can give us back the absence of before\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nathalie Lees</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By resigning ourselves to the frenetic distractions of the attention economy, digital natives like my children and yours risk losing touch with the experience of what it is to be truly alone with their thoughts. Yes, their entertainment is more sophisticated than what we grew up with (what sane person would trade the bounty of Netflix for terrestrial <em>Friends</em> reruns?), but it\u2019s those empty, restless, vaguely melancholic hours, spent staring at clouds and lounging in trees, they\u2019ll miss. Not that they\u2019ll long for what they don\u2019t know. But we will, the innocents, aka the ones who recall the emptiness and boredom. For it\u2019s in those lost hours that we unwittingly got to know ourselves; our imaginations, unbridled, were free to play and laze and wander. And while it was dull and uneventful at times it\u2019s also true that all of humanity\u2019s wonders \u2013 including the internet itself \u2013 have arisen from this one simple source: a person, a thought, a daydream.</p> <p>It\u2019s precisely this \u201closs of lack\u201d Vancouver Michael Harris explores in <em>The End of Absence</em>. His experiments with regaining solitude remind me of my father\u2019s desk: go for a long walk without your phone, he recommends. Spend an afternoon writing in longhand. Read 150 pages in one sitting. Simple in theory, but strangely terrifying in practice.</p> <p>Like Williams, Harris told me he doesn\u2019t consider himself anti-technology so much as a critical observer of its effects. He points out that all human inventions, even those we consider banal or beneficial, such as cars or books, hijack our brains and disrupt our consciousness. What we risk losing to the emergence of big data is the richness of our interior lives.</p> <p>\u201cThe experience of empty space allows for the growth of imagination and independent thought, the ability to form ideas without being swayed by mass opinion or bot armies,\u201d he said. Moreover, virtual connection impedes our ability to connect and empathise. \u201cWhen you are inundated with mediated social connectivity it\u2019s increasingly difficult to devote your attention to the people you are actually with.\u201d</p> <p>More than anything, Harris worries that in future only the privileged few will be able to afford to take regular \u201cdigital detoxes\u201d from the exhausting demands of the attention economy. As we talk, I think of my seven-year-old who, for the first time this summer, will fly with me to Ottawa then take a six-hour bus to the wilds of Northern Ontario where he will spend seven nights sleeping in a tent, canoeing and eating freeze-dried food cooked over a camp fire with 30 other kids. He won\u2019t have electricity and plumbing, let alone the internet. I won\u2019t disclose the fees except to say it isn\u2019t cheap to abandon a kid in the woods these days.</p> <p><em><strong>The ICO\u2019s Age</strong></em> Appropriate Design Code will be laid before parliament this autumn. If properly implemented and enforced, it may well make the internet a much safer, secure place for generations of British children to come. While it will, in theory, mean a vast improvement, even Denham\u2019s reimagined internet won\u2019t entirely reclaim our pre-digital innocence. No amount of legislating can give us back the absence of before. Which isn\u2019t to say innocence, or some version of it, can\u2019t be regained, through careful daily practice. Like the act of disconnecting our kids and sending them out to play in the garden. Or of sitting, just for an hour, at my father\u2019s empty desk.</p> <h2>Let\u2019s go digital</h2> <p>Key developments that changed the way we communicate.

For weeks after meeting Denham, I found myself haunted by the notion of digital immigration and what it means for my generation. I\u2019d always assumed that not being connected as a child had been a handicap \u2013 surely it explained why I\u2019m hopeless at figuring out the smart TV remote or programming the digital thermostat. Like most kids I spent idle summer days drifting around our garden spying faces in the clouds, but my childhood (like most kids in the 80s) was also awash in cultural drek. I had way more weekly screen time than my own kids, most of it spent zoning out on bad sitcom reruns and mind-numbing hours playing Pac-Man on our Commodore 64 so our mum \u2013 a housewife with no domestic help \u2013 could get the next meal on the table. Surely bingeing on the brilliance of Pixar films and the architectural complexities of Minecraft today is a superior way for a child to spend a rainy afternoon? I began to investigate what it was that marked my generation out \u2013 what was the \u201cinnocence\u201d lost, if any? I was surprised then to discover many of the neuroscientists, cyber-psychologists and tech ethicists who spend their lives pondering the cultural and moral ramifications of the digital revolution have come to believe that there is something special in my generation, and the recollection of our shared analogue past. It\u2019s not that digital immigrants are smarter or more talented than the digital natives that came after us. Our uniqueness, it seems, lies in the fact that we are the last of a dying breed and as such, living, breathing receptacles of a soon-to-be lost plane of human experience: empty yawning hours and days of nothing much at all. \u201cWhich would you rather be, extremely poor with loads of friends or super rich with no friends at all?\u201d This hypothetical question was put to me recently out of nowhere by my 11-year-old stepson. For me the answer was easy. \u201cPoor with friends,\u201d I said. \u201cIn the long run, loneliness would be worse than poverty.\u201d My stepson disagreed. \u201cDefo rich with no friends. I\u2019d just stay in my mansion and play Fortnite and watch YouTube and hang out with people online.\u201d He\u2019s a popular kid and part of a close-knit group of boys who\u2019ve been friends since starting school. When offered a choice of whether they\u2019d like to watch a movie together or spend two hours playing Fortnite and interfacing remotely on headsets, the lads didn\u2019t miss a beat in choosing the latter. This is because, for digital natives like my stepson and his mates, socialising online is the same as \u2013 at times even preferable to \u2013 socialising in person. For his 11th birthday he got his first smart phone and it was as if we\u2019d handed him the keys to a magic portal to an idealised parallel universe. I suppose in a way we had. Just as puberty begins to set in, we\u2019d given him a comfort innocents like me and my husband had never known as alienated adolescents: the feeling of being with friends all the time. The absence of aloneness. For years, scientific debate has raged over whether or not sustained internet use has a deleterious effect on human brain function \u2013 particularly on the developing brains of children. The never-ending \u201cscreentime debate\u201d has, historically, been heavy on conjecture and light on hard data. But this spring the results of a sweeping international study were published in World Psychiatry, a respected international journal, which may have tipped the balance in favour of digital sceptics. An international team of researchers working with large sample groups in two separate methodologies (MRI brain imaging and behavioural observation), consistently found compelling evidence that prolonged internet use produces both \u201cacute and sustained alterations in specific areas of cognition,\u201d which may reflect long-term changes in the brain, affecting attention span, memory and social interactions. Dr Joseph Firth, the Manchester-born neuroscientist who led the study told me that while the human brain does seem to interpret online socialising and connection in much the same way as the in-person variety (great news for friendless super-rich shut-ins), other cognitive functions are shown to be weakened. For instance, he said, the brain adapts fairly quickly to treating the internet as a kind of outsourced memory bank, which results over time in the reduction of our own \u201ctransactive memory function,\u201d ie the mental sorting processes the brain performs in order to locate and grasp a fact or mental image. \u201cThe problem with the internet,\u201d Firth explained, \u201cis that our brains seem to quickly figure out it\u2019s there \u2013 and outsource.\u201d This would be fine if we could rely on the internet for information the same way we rely on, say, the British Library. But what happens when we subconsciously outsource a complex cognitive function to an unreliable online world manipulated by capitalist interests and agents of distortion? \u201cWhat happens to children born in a world where transactive memory is no longer as widely exercised as a cognitive function?\u201d he asked. James Williams, a former Google strategist-turned Oxford-trained philosopher and digital ethicist is convinced the loss of solitude we are now experiencing is more than just an end of innocence. His book, Stand Out of our Light, outlines the moral danger of the current \u201cattention economy\u201d in which capitalist interests vie constantly to distract us for their own enrichment. Williams told me that unless we find better ways to regulate and interact with the pernicious distractions of big tech, we risk compromising our personal and collective goals and values, even imperilling our own free will. \u201cIf what we attend to is, in a very real sense, what we are, then what\u2019s at stake in the battle for our attention is nothing less than our ability to determine and pursue the kinds of lives we want to live, both individually and societally,\u201d he said. As someone who, like me, grew up in a world without the internet, Williams worries that we will continue to \u201cconflate entertainment with leisure, resulting in fewer and fewer opportunities for reflection and introspection.\u201d By resigning ourselves to the frenetic distractions of the attention economy, digital natives like my children and yours risk losing touch with the experience of what it is to be truly alone with their thoughts. Yes, their entertainment is more sophisticated than what we grew up with (what sane person would trade the bounty of Netflix for terrestrial Friends reruns?), but it\u2019s those empty, restless, vaguely melancholic hours, spent staring at clouds and lounging in trees, they\u2019ll miss. Not that they\u2019ll long for what they don\u2019t know. But we will, the innocents, aka the ones who recall the emptiness and boredom. For it\u2019s in those lost hours that we unwittingly got to know ourselves; our imaginations, unbridled, were free to play and laze and wander. And while it was dull and uneventful at times it\u2019s also true that all of humanity\u2019s wonders \u2013 including the internet itself \u2013 have arisen from this one simple source: a person, a thought, a daydream. It\u2019s precisely this \u201closs of lack\u201d Vancouver Michael Harris explores in The End of Absence. His experiments with regaining solitude remind me of my father\u2019s desk: go for a long walk without your phone, he recommends. Spend an afternoon writing in longhand. Read 150 pages in one sitting. Simple in theory, but strangely terrifying in practice. Like Williams, Harris told me he doesn\u2019t consider himself anti-technology so much as a critical observer of its effects. He points out that all human inventions, even those we consider banal or beneficial, such as cars or books, hijack our brains and disrupt our consciousness. What we risk losing to the emergence of big data is the richness of our interior lives. \u201cThe experience of empty space allows for the growth of imagination and independent thought, the ability to form ideas without being swayed by mass opinion or bot armies,\u201d he said. Moreover, virtual connection impedes our ability to connect and empathise. \u201cWhen you are inundated with mediated social connectivity it\u2019s increasingly difficult to devote your attention to the people you are actually with.\u201d More than anything, Harris worries that in future only the privileged few will be able to afford to take regular \u201cdigital detoxes\u201d from the exhausting demands of the attention economy. As we talk, I think of my seven-year-old who, for the first time this summer, will fly with me to Ottawa then take a six-hour bus to the wilds of Northern Ontario where he will spend seven nights sleeping in a tent, canoeing and eating freeze-dried food cooked over a camp fire with 30 other kids. He won\u2019t have electricity and plumbing, let alone the internet. I won\u2019t disclose the fees except to say it isn\u2019t cheap to abandon a kid in the woods these days. The ICO\u2019s Age Appropriate Design Code will be laid before parliament this autumn. If properly implemented and enforced, it may well make the internet a much safer, secure place for generations of British children to come. While it will, in theory, mean a vast improvement, even Denham\u2019s reimagined internet won\u2019t entirely reclaim our pre-digital innocence. No amount of legislating can give us back the absence of before. Which isn\u2019t to say innocence, or some version of it, can\u2019t be regained, through careful daily practice. Like the act of disconnecting our kids and sending them out to play in the garden. Or of sitting, just for an hour, at my father\u2019s empty desk. Let\u2019s go digital Key developments that changed the way we communicate. By Hayley Myers 1971: Email Ray Tomlinson was responsible for electronic mail as we know it, choosing the @ sign to connect the username with its destination. Today, it\u2019s estimated there are 3.9 billion email users. 1992: Phone texting British engineer Neil Papworth sent the first SMS \u2013 \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 \u2013 from his computer to the mobile phone of Vodafone\u2019s Richard Jarvis. Handsets didn\u2019t include keyboards then, so Jarvis was unable to reply. 1997: Chat rooms Talking to friends (and strangers) in chat rooms dominated the late 1990s. The rise of other internet technologies saw their popularity plummet in the following decade, taking the ubiquitous a/s/l abbreviation with it. 2004: Social media Whether a place of meaningful connection, a worrying echo chamber or both, Myspace and its successors created an era where likes, influencers and filters reign supreme \u2013 despite recent concerns over privacy and data breaches. 2005: YouTube YouTube\u2019s first ever video, \u2018Me At The Zoo\u2019, was uploaded by the channel\u2019s founder Jawed Karim. It\u2019s since been viewed 73m times, paving the way for cultural moments, such as \u2018Charlie Bit My Finger\u2019, skateboarding bulldogs and Justin Bieber.",

Given Johnson\u2019s predilection for delegation, his choice of cadres to steer the housing and built environment briefs connotes an intention, of sorts, even as Brexit continues to derail politics as usual. Following the Night of the Blond Knives, Robert Jenrick was installed as secretary of state for housing, local government and communities. The first cabinet minister to be born in the 1980s, it has been mirthlessly suggested that he is the ideal man for the job since he owns three homes. Like his predecessors, he is not short of platitudes. \u201cI\u2019m going to strain every sinew and try to pull every lever that\u2019s available to me to help communities build the homes they need,\u201d he told <em>Inside Housing</em>.</p> <p>Esther McVey was also appointed to be the ninth housing minister since 2010.

Seen as an in extremis response to the housing crisis, the outcome is, more often than not, cramped and substandard dwellings that compromise the mental and physical health of occupants. Britain already has some of the smallest domestic space standards in Europe.</p> <p>The day after the changing of the Tory guard, the RIBA released the shortlist for the inaugural <a href=\"https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/knowledge-landing-page/first-neave-brown-award-for-housing-shortlist-announced\" title=\"\">Neave Brown a</a><a href=\"https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/knowledge-landing-page/first-neave-brown-award-for-housing-shortlist-announced\" title=\"\">ward for housing</a>, a long overdue recognition of the importance of decent, dignified dwelling design. A project for mass housing has not won the Stirling prize since 2008, as its \u201cbest in show\u201d mentality tends to favour more architecturally adventurous submissions. Now housing has its own dedicated award, named after the late American-born British architect Neave Brown (1929-2018), whose work for Camden council represented the apogee of modernist design, delivered by well-resourced borough architects\u2019 departments before the public sector was ruthlessly dismantled through Thatcherite right-to-buy policies.</p> <p>Despite the new award\u2019s admirable ambitions, it has thrown up a rather lacklustre shortlist. With their carefully calibrated mixture of tenures, cross-subsidy arrangements and muted palettes of brick, the four schemes \u2013 two in London, one in Cambridge and one in Norwich \u2013 seem virtually indistinguishable from one another, reflecting the distance travelled since Brown\u2019s swashbuckling days. From helping to drive and implement a progressive social agenda for housing, architects now find themselves increasingly marginalised and this is reflected in a more cautious, middle-brow design approach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7f8b57da6d03cf651ed692d5f6eca69b3c114b8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f8b57da6d03cf651ed692d5f6eca69b3c114b8c/0_0_8256_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goldsmith Street social housing in Norwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goldsmith Street social housing in Norwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Crocker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the quartet, the most exemplary is <a href=\"https://www.architecture.com/awards-and-competitions-landing-page/awards/riba-regional-awards/riba-east-award-winners/2019/goldsmith-street\" title=\"\">Goldsmith Street</a>, a development of 100 houses in Norwich, built by the city council, offering secure tenures at fixed rents. Designed by Mikhail Riches and Cathy Hawley, it is that rare thing \u2013 actual social housing \u2013 in a modern reincarnation of Victorian terraces. Unlike their 19th-century predecessors, however, the houses are ultra-parsimonious in their use of energy. Annual heating bills should be around \u00a3150.</p> <p>With the lifting of the borrowing cap on local authorities, announced last year, there are fitful signs of movement in the moribund public housing sector that has hitherto had to rely on Faustian pacts with private developers to deliver a proportion of \u201caffordable\u201d dwellings. This has led to the obscene spectacle of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/25/poor-doors-developers-segregate-rich-from-poor-london-housing-blocks\" title=\"\">poor doors</a>\u201d for different occupant constituencies. Housing charity Shelter estimates that lifting the borrowing cap could increase new social housing provision to 27,500 dwellings annually, from just 5,000 built in 2017. Yet more is still desperately needed. In 2018, there were 1.11m households on local authority waiting lists.</p> <p>This year marks the centenary of the Addison Act, which made housing a national responsibility. Subsidised by government grants, local authorities were given the task of developing new housing and rented accommodation where it was needed by working people. It represents the birth of the public sector housing movement and the expression of social ideas through architecture in a rich concerto of nation building. During the interwar period, local councils built 1.1m homes in total, an unthinkable prospect today.</p> <p>After 40 years of catastrophic inaction, there is an urgent need for a reframing of priorities across the board, in funding, procurement, design and delivery. This constitutes a challenge that any prime minister should be eager to address, but it seems clear that Boris Johnson\u2019s attention will, as usual, be elsewhere.

Like his predecessors, he is not short of platitudes. \u201cI\u2019m going to strain every sinew and try to pull every lever that\u2019s available to me to help communities build the homes they need,\u201d he told Inside Housing. Esther McVey was also appointed to be the ninth housing minister since 2010. Her glibly insensitive assertions about food banks and the impact of universal credit delays, coupled with a dimwitted Tory leadership campaign, suggests she is another career mediocrity who will tug ineffectually at the Gordian knot of housing and then sink without trace. From the sidelines, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) extended a tentative welcome to the latest ministerial team, while calling for action on the government\u2019s changes to permitted development rights, which enable redundant office blocks to be cannibalised for housing. Seen as an in extremis response to the housing crisis, the outcome is, more often than not, cramped and substandard dwellings that compromise the mental and physical health of occupants. Britain already has some of the smallest domestic space standards in Europe. The day after the changing of the Tory guard, the RIBA released the shortlist for the inaugural Neave Brown award for housing, a long overdue recognition of the importance of decent, dignified dwelling design. A project for mass housing has not won the Stirling prize since 2008, as its \u201cbest in show\u201d mentality tends to favour more architecturally adventurous submissions. Now housing has its own dedicated award, named after the late American-born British architect Neave Brown (1929-2018), whose work for Camden council represented the apogee of modernist design, delivered by well-resourced borough architects\u2019 departments before the public sector was ruthlessly dismantled through Thatcherite right-to-buy policies. Despite the new award\u2019s admirable ambitions, it has thrown up a rather lacklustre shortlist. With their carefully calibrated mixture of tenures, cross-subsidy arrangements and muted palettes of brick, the four schemes \u2013 two in London, one in Cambridge and one in Norwich \u2013 seem virtually indistinguishable from one another, reflecting the distance travelled since Brown\u2019s swashbuckling days. From helping to drive and implement a progressive social agenda for housing, architects now find themselves increasingly marginalised and this is reflected in a more cautious, middle-brow design approach. Of the quartet, the most exemplary is Goldsmith Street, a development of 100 houses in Norwich, built by the city council, offering secure tenures at fixed rents. Designed by Mikhail Riches and Cathy Hawley, it is that rare thing \u2013 actual social housing \u2013 in a modern reincarnation of Victorian terraces. Unlike their 19th-century predecessors, however, the houses are ultra-parsimonious in their use of energy. Annual heating bills should be around \u00a3150. With the lifting of the borrowing cap on local authorities, announced last year, there are fitful signs of movement in the moribund public housing sector that has hitherto had to rely on Faustian pacts with private developers to deliver a proportion of \u201caffordable\u201d dwellings. This has led to the obscene spectacle of \u201cpoor doors\u201d for different occupant constituencies. Housing charity Shelter estimates that lifting the borrowing cap could increase new social housing provision to 27,500 dwellings annually, from just 5,000 built in 2017. Yet more is still desperately needed. In 2018, there were 1.11m households on local authority waiting lists. This year marks the centenary of the Addison Act, which made housing a national responsibility. Subsidised by government grants, local authorities were given the task of developing new housing and rented accommodation where it was needed by working people. It represents the birth of the public sector housing movement and the expression of social ideas through architecture in a rich concerto of nation building. During the interwar period, local councils built 1.1m homes in total, an unthinkable prospect today. After 40 years of catastrophic inaction, there is an urgent need for a reframing of priorities across the board, in funding, procurement, design and delivery. This constitutes a challenge that any prime minister should be eager to address, but it seems clear that Boris Johnson\u2019s attention will, as usual, be elsewhere. Reader, if you seek his monument\u2026 The winner of the Neave Brown award for housing will be announced at the RIBA Stirling prize ceremony on 8 October at the Roundhouse, London",

      "body": "<p>Lucy Prebble operates an \u201celephant in the room\u201d method when it comes to writing plays: she tries to take on the biggest overlooked ideas that shape our world.</p> <p>\u201cIn theatre there is always a lot of very tasteful, refined work,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be dismissive of that. But it doesn\u2019t feel very representative of life at the moment, which feels to me quite ugly and lacking taste and unrefined. Rambunctious.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged on a sofa in the back offices of the Old Vic theatre, Prebble, 38, is quick to find a self-deprecating angle to things. In a summer dress and with an open smile she does not look like a firestarter, but don\u2019t be fooled. Her new play, which I have only read, but which comes to vivid life on the page, is a dramatisation of the murder by poisoning of the former KGB whistleblower and British citizen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\" title=\"\">Alexander Litvinenko</a> in London in 2006. It is loosely a spy drama, but it is not John le Carr\u00e9. \u201cIt is,\u201d Prebble suggests, \u201chopefully quite crude, a bit crass. There is this British idea of espionage having elegant cufflinks, but that is perhaps not the brutal reality.\u201d The Russian agents who murdered Litvinenko by putting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/polonium-210-poison-alexander-litvinenko\" title=\"\">p</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/polonium-210-poison-alexander-litvinenko\" title=\"\">olonium-2</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/polonium-210-poison-alexander-litvinenko\" title=\"\">10</a> into his teapot were blundering stooges, not elite operatives.</p> <p>The play is based on the book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/very-expensive-poison-luke-harding-review-litvinenko-murder\" title=\"\">A Very Expensive Poison</a>,</em> by the <em>Guardian\u2019s</em> Luke Harding, which followed the belated 2016 inquiry into Litvinenko\u2019s murder. Harding could not be more enthused about the way that Prebble has brought to life the \u201cawful mixture of playfulness and ghoulishness\u201d at the heart of the story. \u201cThe terrible death of Alexander Litvinenko is like something out of John Webster,\u201d he said to me, speaking about the play. \u201cBut at the same time there is something comically absurd about these two moronic assassins wandering around London with this powerful poison \u2013 they don\u2019t know quite what it is \u2013 strewing radiation all around the place, trying to pick up women, going for rides in cycle rickshaws. What Lucy captures really well is this clash of incompetence and malevolence.\u201d</p> <p>Some of that tone, and the comic, expressive way she articulates it, will be familiar to audiences of Prebble\u2019s breakthrough play, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/sep/23/enron-review\" title=\"\">Enron</a></em>, which skewered the hubris and banality of boardroom greed, while also offering a nuanced song-and-dance primer on the forces that collapsed the world\u2019s economy.</p> <p>She says she tries to wait for stories to announce themselves to her. \u201cI am not the sort of writer who wants to have plays on all the time, exploring aspects of me. I think it is a big ask to get people to come out spending money and sit in these seats. I think I won\u2019t bother people unless it feels quite important. And this to me felt quite important.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87afa949d86d2a891032e5577ba44b8a967f303b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87afa949d86d2a891032e5577ba44b8a967f303b/0_306_5656_3394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MyAnna Buring and Tom Brooke in rehearsal for A Very Expensive Poison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MyAnna Buring and Tom Brooke in rehearsal for A Very Expensive Poison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Importance, for Prebble, is about portents. She was sent Harding\u2019s book to read at the beginning of 2017. The Salisbury poisonings hadn\u2019t happened yet, but Trump had just come to power. Her excitement about writing the play boiled down to the sense that \u201cthere was something in the present that I felt was explained by this story\u201d.</p> <p>When she interrogated that feeling, it was to do with the way that the surreal had crept up to become commonplace in our lives. The absurdist criminality of the poisoning of Litvinenko felt like a harbinger of all that we have been experiencing for the past five years, in a way; reality being knocked out of shape by forces beyond our control. \u201cIt\u2019s about sudden shifts in the boundaries of what is normal,\u201d Prebble says. \u201cWe all thought Trump definitely won\u2019t get in. Or Brexit definitely won\u2019t happen, and then each time the reality shifts you have to adjust.\u201d From there it is not far to the idea of \u201cnothing is true and everything is possible\u201d.</p> <p>Theatre seemed the perfect place to explore the unsettling spectacle of politics. Though Prebble has been widely acclaimed as one of the significant dramatists of her generation, she doesn\u2019t think of herself as a woman of the theatre, necessarily. Her first loves were video games and books rather than plays or films. When she was taken along to theatre as a girl \u2013 she grew up in Haslemere in Surrey, the youngest daughter of an IT consultancy director \u2013 she says she always felt a bit embarrassed for the performers, asking us to make believe. But at a time when real life has become harder to trust she has grown to understand the power \u2013 and dramatic irony \u2013 of having real people sit in a darkened room and collectively suspend disbelief.</p> <p>The Litvinenko case, in which such shadowy figures as Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Putin become rival puppeteers, was a perfect vehicle to expose the distortions of the truth. Even so, the more Prebble read about it, the more that cerebral scaffolding contrasted with the human tragedy at the heart of it. Much of her drama is focused on the emergency room of Barnet and Chase Farm hospital in north London, where Marina and Alexander (Sasha) Litvinenko found themselves trying to explain to British police detectives what might have happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0ebf261fed94e283d78cd80b0fb23c06c8d4aae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0ebf261fed94e283d78cd80b0fb23c06c8d4aae/180_181_3000_2287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marina Litvinenko in 2016, holding the results of the inquiry into the death of her husband Alexander.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"762\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marina Litvinenko in 2016, holding the results of the inquiry into the death of her husband, Alexander.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prebble met Marina Litvinenko many times to discuss the story with her. The first time \u2013 after she had been introduced by Harding \u2013 was with trepidation: \u201cpartly because I didn\u2019t want to feel sort of beholden to her as a writer,\u201d she says. \u201cBut also because she had been through this terrible tragedy, and obviously I didn\u2019t want to misrepresent the truth emotionally.\u201d</p> <p>Prebble need not have worried. Marina Litvinenko proved not only an enthusiast for the project \u201cbut really playful, very twinkly, quite dry\u201d. Prebble told her how a stage play \u2013 particularly <em>her </em>stage play \u2013 would be different from a book, in that it would be going feet first into emotional areas. Litvinenko understood that. \u201cShe told me two things that I valued hugely,\u201d Prebble says. \u201cThe first was: please don\u2019t forget the cost to our lives of what happened. And the second thing was: please don\u2019t forget that this is a love story.\u201d</p> <p>The day after I interviewed Prebble last week, I spoke to Marina Litvinenko on the phone about the play. She explained how at the beginning of the rehearsal process she had been in to meet the cast and give as much detail about the people as she could. \u201cNot only about my character and Sasha\u2019s character, but about the meetings in Russia and the politics.\u201d She liked how enthusiastic the cast were \u201cto try to understand more and more about what happened\u201d \u2013 reflecting her own personal mission for the past 13 years.</p> <p>Litvinenko has long got used to the surreal, but it was a different level of strangeness to be briefing actors pretending to be her and her late husband. She squared this with herself by understanding that \u201cthis is not only a story of what happened to us, it is a really important story in understanding what is happening now in Russia, and in Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Given that it is a play about the difficulties of getting to the truth, there is an extra premium on veracity. Prebble dismantles all the ironies of the obstacles that Marina Litvinenko faced \u2013 whether they came from the Kremlin with its familiar blizzard of denial and diversion \u2013 or the official rebuttals of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/10/litvinenko-inquest-british-secret-courts\" title=\"\">Chris Grayling</a>, who refused her legal aid, or Theresa May. There is a dogged triumph to the eventual conclusion of the inquiry report into Litvinenko\u2019s death in which Sir Robert Owen stated plainly: \u201cI am sure that Mr [Andrei] Lugovoi and Mr [Dmitry] Kovtun placed the polonium-210 in the teapot at the Millennium hotel on 1 November 2016.\u201d The more often you hear that line in Prebble\u2019s play the more you are reminded of George Orwell\u2019s observation that \u201cIn times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act\u201d. Marina Litvinenko continues courageously to pursue the extradition of her husband\u2019s alleged murderers, but she is sanguine about the likelihood of success. \u201cEven if they are brought to justice in 20 years or 30,\u201d she says, \u201cI am still satisfied that they are being punished every day that they wake up and know that they are murderers.\u201d</p> <p>Does she think that Prebble\u2019s play can advance her demands for justice?</p> <p>She says that the current Russian regime is \u201cwithout shame\u201d, though she believes the current protests in Moscow indicate that change will come. She worries more, she says, about \u201chow many times the British government are going to make the same mistakes. In 2000 when Blair believed he was in a good relationship with Putin it finished in a bad one in 2006. David Cameron thought he could build a new relationship and it didn\u2019t happen. Let us see what happens with the new prime minster\u2026\u201d</p> <p>We both laugh.</p> <p>\u201cActually,\u201d she says, \u201cI would like Boris Johnson to watch this play. That would be a good start for him.\u201d</p> <p>Prebble says that a primary concern in the writing was to bring the intimacy of the Litvinenkos\u2019 marriage to the stage. They bicker and banter affectionately in the hospital as they try to get the story straight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9310e9fdd6b3690799576283b9e56be7ca935234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9310e9fdd6b3690799576283b9e56be7ca935234/0_268_3872_2324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Litvinenko on his hospital bed after being poisoned in London in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander Litvinenko on his hospital bed after being poisoned in London in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natasja Weitsz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mystified medical and police response in the play is a reminder of how hard it was to find a context for the poisoning at the time. \u201cIf we had placed Putin at all in 2006,\u201d Prebble says, \u201cit was as someone we could probably do business with. Obviously now looking back, the poisoning seems like an experiment in pushing boundaries. If the Blair government and the Cameron government had reacted more strongly, then perhaps we would not be where we are.\u201d</p> <p>Harding agrees. But even when he wrote his book in 2016 he was convinced that the Kremlin \u201cwould never order this kind of thing again, because the fallout was so disastrous\u201d. But then the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/26/skripal-poisonings-bungled-assassination-kremlin-putin-salisbury\" title=\"\">Skripal poisoning</a> happened in Salisbury, almost a copycat crime.</p> <p>Does he believe they did so to prove that they could do so?</p> <p>\u201cI think Skripal was a huge V-sign to the British establishment,\u201d Harding says. \u201cIt said: you are weak, a declining power in the world; you will be friendless after Brexit and we can do this kind of thing on your territory any time we like. And what\u2019s more we can joke about it afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>One of the things that concentrated Prebble\u2019s mind in shaping the tone of her play was those disturbing Russian TV interviews with the perpetrators of the Salisbury attack, speaking about their interest in visiting the city to view the cathedral\u2019s famous spire. \u201cIt is the satire that Putin has always used,\u201d she says. \u201cThis idea of you know I\u2019m lying, but we are bonded together in this smirking joke.\u201d</p> <p>We talk about how that principle has been exported \u2013 with examples that include Donald Trump\u2019s more bizarre Twitter delusions to Boris Johnson\u2019s fantasies about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-reveals-he-makes-models-of-buses-to-relax\" title=\"\">making buses out of wine crates</a>. The thread is that the joke is on those who would seek conventional truth; the punchline is that truth does not matter, when you have power.</p> <p>Prebble\u2019s play seeks to undermine that relationship. She puts Putin centre stage, initially as a kind of David Brent figure. \u201cHe is shorter than you think,\u201d reads her first stage direction about the president.</p> <p>\u201cI thought quite hard about whether or not to include him,\u201d she says. \u201cNot out of fear or anything, but because the mythologising is something he clearly enjoys.\u201d</p> <p>We live in a world, I say, increasingly dominated by authoritarian men whose greatest fears are being laughed at or ignored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"334614e94578a721776df1d5048d3834888213ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/334614e94578a721776df1d5048d3834888213ca/0_194_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel West as Jeffrey Skilling in the original production of Enron at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samuel West as Jeffrey Skilling in the original production of Enron at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Cooper / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat the play is about in some sense,\u201d she says, \u201cis how we manage male humiliation. All women know the dangers of being around a man who has been humiliated \u2013 it is an emotion that can shift quickly into anger and aggression. If that happens en masse, whether it is Russia after the cold war, or parts of Britain or the midwest after the collapse of manufacturing, it creates great potential for anger, and for the political forces that can exploit that.\u201d</p> <p>I last spoke to Prebble about some of those issues in an interview a decade ago, when her play <em>Enron</em> was in rehearsal at Islington. Looking back, she sees that symbolic corporate collapse and the banking crisis that it foreshadowed as the starting gun for our current polarised politics, particularly the populist determination to blame mass migration for austerity rather than the black hole created by millionaire money managers.</p> <p><em>Enron </em>began as a great success story for her. Rupert Goold\u2019s production gained five-star critical acclaim and transferred for a sell-out season in the West End that made it seem a nailed-on hit for Broadway. In fact, however, after lukewarm previews and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/theater/reviews/28enron.html\" title=\"\">hostile reviews</a>, the major New York production closed after only 10 days. That must have come as a shock?</p> <p>\u201cShock implies I was expecting it to go well,\u201d she says, with a quick laugh. \u201cAnd as my family would tell you, I don\u2019t approach life like that. I wish I did. But it wasn\u2019t just a critical mauling over there; audiences didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p> <p>She is not completely sure why. It would be too easy, she insists, to say that the Americans didn\u2019t want a clever young British woman exposing and ridiculing the corruption of Wall Street. \u201c<em>Hamilton</em> is the perfect American show,\u201d she says. \u201cThe struggle and the optimism and the triumph. It\u2019s brilliant. But I have a bleaker sensibility. For some people my plays can feel like being hit over the head with information all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Prebble wrote another play, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/18/the-effect-lucy-prebble-review\" title=\"\">The Effect</a></em>, based on the clinical trial for a new anti-depressant, which among other things questioned whether emotion manipulated by chemicals was for real. After that there has been a seven-year gap until the Litvinenko play. Why was that?</p> <p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d Prebble says. \u201cThe truth is I had a really rough few years personally. I think I had a bit of a breakdown, looking back. I only use that word because that is exactly what it felt like.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t want to go into the specifics (\u201cit\u2019s not just my story\u201d) except to say \u201cI had a lot of loss in my life in a very short period\u201d. The result was that she became somewhat paralysed creatively. \u201cI thought depression was about smashing things up, or staying in bed all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut for me it was this kind of impossibility of making even the smallest decisions. It felt like there was no centre from which I was acting. I lost a lot of confidence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1617e89abd1287fca218005bb9cc605dede00ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1617e89abd1287fca218005bb9cc605dede00ac/0_168_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Prebble and Billie Piper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I love Lucy as a person\u2019: Prebble with her friend Billie Piper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Wooller/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She found it harder and harder to write. She did a pilot for an HBO series starring Sarah Silverman, \u201csomeone I really admire and love\u201d. HBO dropped it. \u201cEveryone was looking to me to be the American idea of the showrunner,\u201d she says, \u201cand I was at my least confident at that point.\u201d</p> <p>What was the HBO story about?</p> <p>\u201cIt was a show about a woman who works in the computer-games industry and falls in love with a guy and moves to London to be with him. And finds herself being a stepmother to his kids and hating it. It was supposed to be funny but it came out bleak.\u201d</p> <p>As a result of that Prebble \u201chad that bad feeling that I\u2019d had a great opportunity and squandered it and felt the shame of that.\u201d There were other ideas that she tried to write but which didn\u2019t get a good reaction and were immediately abandoned.</p> <p>A few things helped her through that period, she says. One was friendship. She talks very warmly about her closeness to Billie Piper, the actress with whom she first worked on the ITV adaptation of <em>The Secret Diary of a Call Girl</em> \u2013 a difficult TV baptism for both of them. Piper also later starred in <em>The Effect</em>.</p> <p>Speaking later about her friendship with Prebble, Piper agrees with the playwright\u2019s suggestion that they are mutual muses as well as mates. \u201cAs much as I love Lucy as a person and care about her emotionally I am also really interested in her,\u201d Piper told me. \u201cShe fascinates me as a woman.\u201d</p> <p>Some of that fascination comes from watching Prebble work. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Piper says. \u201cLucy starts with really big themes. With <em>The Effect</em> it was about a drug trial and whether love was real or a placebo itself. A really big bold intellectual idea, but then she finds the human story in it.\u201d</p> <p>For a time, when Prebble was struggling, the pair of them \u201cwere constantly on the phone handling each other\u2019s emotional stuff.\u201d Piper had been on at her friend for years to work together again on TV \u201cbut the experience was so traumatic the first time around that it has taken this long to get back on board\u201d. The pair have been working on something for about three years that is finally going into production in the autumn.</p> <p>What is the story?</p> <p>\u201cIt is about two women in their 30s and how different that looks to being a woman in your 20s,\u201d Piper says. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been through our fair share of crisis and we want to see if we can speak a bit for our generation. Or at least that\u2019s the plan\u2026. \u201d</p> <p>It took Prebble a while to get herself back to the point where she was sure she had something to say. As well as friendships there were a couple of professional experiences that helped her to regain her writer\u2019s voice. The first was accepting an offer to work on a video game called, appropriately enough, <em>Destiny</em>, out in Seattle. Prebble went over to help them with their storytelling. She found the experience of playing a bit part to animators and designers \u201cvery comforting; also there was a child version of myself who was in love with video games\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8370c1e813f1bfbceaeae03c9648395d155e20ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8370c1e813f1bfbceaeae03c9648395d155e20ce/0_280_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prebble enjoyed her work on the HBO show Succession, which is soon to begin a second season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prebble enjoyed her work on the HBO show Succession, which is soon to begin a second season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second thing that helped to restore her confidence was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/02/succession-review-brilliant-dissection-mega-rich-family-jesse-armstrong\" title=\"\">HBO series </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/02/succession-review-brilliant-dissection-mega-rich-family-jesse-armstrong\" title=\"\">Succession</a></em>. Jesse Armstrong\u2019s compulsive dynastic drama, which chronicles the comic machinations of a billionaire media family (with echoes of the Murdochs and the Redstones) evolved into a box-set <em>King Lear</em>.</p> <p>Prebble was initially approached to work on it by her American agent. \u201cThey said \u2018do you want to be a writer in the room?\u2019\u201d she recalls \u2013 no longer the lead. \u201cSo I went in at a little bit of a low ebb \u2013 but it was just the most life-changing, brilliant environment. That self-protective thing that can be common in theatre \u2013 \u2018don\u2019t mess with my words!\u2019 \u2013 wasn\u2019t there. All these brilliant comic writers would say, \u2018I\u2019ve written this but it\u2019s a bit shit, can you help?\u2019 I\u2019d never had that before but it was like coming home.\u201d</p> <p>Armstrong, the show\u2019s British creator, concurs: \u201cLucy is a dream collaborator. In a writing room you need to invest in the new idea totally, but then be prepared to disregard it brutally. She has a mixture of worldly omnivorous intelligence mixed with come-on-let\u2019s fix-this-enthusiasm. Also, funny.\u201d</p> <p>Prebble suggests she emerged from the team experience of writing the first series \u201calmost as if I had been rebuilt\u201d. Season two of <em>Succession</em> airs on 12 August; she has just finished work on the final episode.</p> <p>Prebble found another strand of conviction on social media. She has long been a caustic Twitterer. \u201cI withdrew to social media for a while,\u201d she says. \u201cAs someone very invested in games and tech as a kid, I felt like I was reminding myself of what sort of stuff I would say if I could say anything.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/10/gaming-column-lucy-prebble\">I swapped my world for a virtual one \u2013 and I loved what I found</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She has, she says, tried to bring all of that spirit to her play. Without wanting to sound too grand, she suggests that it feels like a political moment to stand up and be counted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look back later in life and think: \u2018what was I doing then?\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>At the end of her play, she turns that challenge back to her audience. Much of the artifice that drives the play dissolves and the Marina Litvinenko character engages directly with the theatregoers.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a time when my absolute nightmare would have been some actor coming up and talking to me in the audience,\u201d Prebble says. \u201cAs I\u2019ve got older, and I\u2019ve been through lots of life experiences and done therapy I realise that those kinds of fears are not healthy. Not allowing yourself to take part and be vulnerable isn\u2019t good for you.\u201d</p> <p>You mean people should think about being actors as well as spectators in our current politics?</p> <p>\u201cExactly. So at the end of this \u2013 and it sounds wanky obviously \u2013 I wanted to make the point that we are all a bit responsible for the society we have created. \u2018Oh dearism\u2019 \u2013 that refrain that everything is bad and none of it is our fault \u2013 that is exactly what those in power want.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs, talks about some of the anxieties of dramatising those concerns with 25 actors. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d she says, returning to the rehearsal room in her head, \u201cThis is a risky, clumsy motherfucker, this play. If it goes down in flames, it goes down in flames. But,\u201d she says, \u201cI really think it is the right thing for now.\u201d</p> <p><em>A Very Expensive Poison runs at the <a href=\"https://www.oldvictheatre.com/availability/a-very-expensive-poison\" title=\"\">Old Vic</a>, London SE1, from 20 August until 5 October.

      "bodyText": "Lucy Prebble operates an \u201celephant in the room\u201d method when it comes to writing plays: she tries to take on the biggest overlooked ideas that shape our world. \u201cIn theatre there is always a lot of very tasteful, refined work,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be dismissive of that. But it doesn\u2019t feel very representative of life at the moment, which feels to me quite ugly and lacking taste and unrefined. Rambunctious.\u201d Sitting cross-legged on a sofa in the back offices of the Old Vic theatre, Prebble, 38, is quick to find a self-deprecating angle to things. In a summer dress and with an open smile she does not look like a firestarter, but don\u2019t be fooled. Her new play, which I have only read, but which comes to vivid life on the page, is a dramatisation of the murder by poisoning of the former KGB whistleblower and British citizen Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. It is loosely a spy drama, but it is not John le Carr\u00e9. \u201cIt is,\u201d Prebble suggests, \u201chopefully quite crude, a bit crass. There is this British idea of espionage having elegant cufflinks, but that is perhaps not the brutal reality.\u201d The Russian agents who murdered Litvinenko by putting polonium-210 into his teapot were blundering stooges, not elite operatives. The play is based on the book A Very Expensive Poison, by the Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding, which followed the belated 2016 inquiry into Litvinenko\u2019s murder. Harding could not be more enthused about the way that Prebble has brought to life the \u201cawful mixture of playfulness and ghoulishness\u201d at the heart of the story. \u201cThe terrible death of Alexander Litvinenko is like something out of John Webster,\u201d he said to me, speaking about the play. \u201cBut at the same time there is something comically absurd about these two moronic assassins wandering around London with this powerful poison \u2013 they don\u2019t know quite what it is \u2013 strewing radiation all around the place, trying to pick up women, going for rides in cycle rickshaws. What Lucy captures really well is this clash of incompetence and malevolence.\u201d Some of that tone, and the comic, expressive way she articulates it, will be familiar to audiences of Prebble\u2019s breakthrough play, Enron, which skewered the hubris and banality of boardroom greed, while also offering a nuanced song-and-dance primer on the forces that collapsed the world\u2019s economy. She says she tries to wait for stories to announce themselves to her. \u201cI am not the sort of writer who wants to have plays on all the time, exploring aspects of me. I think it is a big ask to get people to come out spending money and sit in these seats. I think I won\u2019t bother people unless it feels quite important. And this to me felt quite important.\u201d Importance, for Prebble, is about portents. She was sent Harding\u2019s book to read at the beginning of 2017. The Salisbury poisonings hadn\u2019t happened yet, but Trump had just come to power. Her excitement about writing the play boiled down to the sense that \u201cthere was something in the present that I felt was explained by this story\u201d. When she interrogated that feeling, it was to do with the way that the surreal had crept up to become commonplace in our lives. The absurdist criminality of the poisoning of Litvinenko felt like a harbinger of all that we have been experiencing for the past five years, in a way; reality being knocked out of shape by forces beyond our control. \u201cIt\u2019s about sudden shifts in the boundaries of what is normal,\u201d Prebble says. \u201cWe all thought Trump definitely won\u2019t get in. Or Brexit definitely won\u2019t happen, and then each time the reality shifts you have to adjust.\u201d From there it is not far to the idea of \u201cnothing is true and everything is possible\u201d. Theatre seemed the perfect place to explore the unsettling spectacle of politics. Though Prebble has been widely acclaimed as one of the significant dramatists of her generation, she doesn\u2019t think of herself as a woman of the theatre, necessarily. Her first loves were video games and books rather than plays or films. When she was taken along to theatre as a girl \u2013 she grew up in Haslemere in Surrey, the youngest daughter of an IT consultancy director \u2013 she says she always felt a bit embarrassed for the performers, asking us to make believe. But at a time when real life has become harder to trust she has grown to understand the power \u2013 and dramatic irony \u2013 of having real people sit in a darkened room and collectively suspend disbelief. The Litvinenko case, in which such shadowy figures as Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Putin become rival puppeteers, was a perfect vehicle to expose the distortions of the truth. Even so, the more Prebble read about it, the more that cerebral scaffolding contrasted with the human tragedy at the heart of it. Much of her drama is focused on the emergency room of Barnet and Chase Farm hospital in north London, where Marina and Alexander (Sasha) Litvinenko found themselves trying to explain to British police detectives what might have happened. Prebble met Marina Litvinenko many times to discuss the story with her. The first time \u2013 after she had been introduced by Harding \u2013 was with trepidation: \u201cpartly because I didn\u2019t want to feel sort of beholden to her as a writer,\u201d she says. \u201cBut also because she had been through this terrible tragedy, and obviously I didn\u2019t want to misrepresent the truth emotionally.\u201d Prebble need not have worried. Marina Litvinenko proved not only an enthusiast for the project \u201cbut really playful, very twinkly, quite dry\u201d. Prebble told her how a stage play \u2013 particularly her stage play \u2013 would be different from a book, in that it would be going feet first into emotional areas. Litvinenko understood that. \u201cShe told me two things that I valued hugely,\u201d Prebble says. \u201cThe first was: please don\u2019t forget the cost to our lives of what happened. And the second thing was: please don\u2019t forget that this is a love story.\u201d The day after I interviewed Prebble last week, I spoke to Marina Litvinenko on the phone about the play. She explained how at the beginning of the rehearsal process she had been in to meet the cast and give as much detail about the people as she could. \u201cNot only about my character and Sasha\u2019s character, but about the meetings in Russia and the politics.\u201d She liked how enthusiastic the cast were \u201cto try to understand more and more about what happened\u201d \u2013 reflecting her own personal mission for the past 13 years. Litvinenko has long got used to the surreal, but it was a different level of strangeness to be briefing actors pretending to be her and her late husband. She squared this with herself by understanding that \u201cthis is not only a story of what happened to us, it is a really important story in understanding what is happening now in Russia, and in Britain\u201d. Given that it is a play about the difficulties of getting to the truth, there is an extra premium on veracity. Prebble dismantles all the ironies of the obstacles that Marina Litvinenko faced \u2013 whether they came from the Kremlin with its familiar blizzard of denial and diversion \u2013 or the official rebuttals of Chris Grayling, who refused her legal aid, or Theresa May. There is a dogged triumph to the eventual conclusion of the inquiry report into Litvinenko\u2019s death in which Sir Robert Owen stated plainly: \u201cI am sure that Mr [Andrei] Lugovoi and Mr [Dmitry] Kovtun placed the polonium-210 in the teapot at the Millennium hotel on 1 November 2016.\u201d The more often you hear that line in Prebble\u2019s play the more you are reminded of George Orwell\u2019s observation that \u201cIn times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act\u201d. Marina Litvinenko continues courageously to pursue the extradition of her husband\u2019s alleged murderers, but she is sanguine about the likelihood of success. \u201cEven if they are brought to justice in 20 years or 30,\u201d she says, \u201cI am still satisfied that they are being punished every day that they wake up and know that they are murderers.\u201d Does she think that Prebble\u2019s play can advance her demands for justice? She says that the current Russian regime is \u201cwithout shame\u201d, though she believes the current protests in Moscow indicate that change will come. She worries more, she says, about \u201chow many times the British government are going to make the same mistakes. In 2000 when Blair believed he was in a good relationship with Putin it finished in a bad one in 2006. David Cameron thought he could build a new relationship and it didn\u2019t happen. Let us see what happens with the new prime minster\u2026\u201d We both laugh. \u201cActually,\u201d she says, \u201cI would like Boris Johnson to watch this play. That would be a good start for him.\u201d Prebble says that a primary concern in the writing was to bring the intimacy of the Litvinenkos\u2019 marriage to the stage. They bicker and banter affectionately in the hospital as they try to get the story straight. The mystified medical and police response in the play is a reminder of how hard it was to find a context for the poisoning at the time. \u201cIf we had placed Putin at all in 2006,\u201d Prebble says, \u201cit was as someone we could probably do business with. Obviously now looking back, the poisoning seems like an experiment in pushing boundaries. If the Blair government and the Cameron government had reacted more strongly, then perhaps we would not be where we are.\u201d Harding agrees. But even when he wrote his book in 2016 he was convinced that the Kremlin \u201cwould never order this kind of thing again, because the fallout was so disastrous\u201d. But then the Skripal poisoning happened in Salisbury, almost a copycat crime. Does he believe they did so to prove that they could do so? \u201cI think Skripal was a huge V-sign to the British establishment,\u201d Harding says. \u201cIt said: you are weak, a declining power in the world; you will be friendless after Brexit and we can do this kind of thing on your territory any time we like. And what\u2019s more we can joke about it afterwards.\u201d One of the things that concentrated Prebble\u2019s mind in shaping the tone of her play was those disturbing Russian TV interviews with the perpetrators of the Salisbury attack, speaking about their interest in visiting the city to view the cathedral\u2019s famous spire. \u201cIt is the satire that Putin has always used,\u201d she says. \u201cThis idea of you know I\u2019m lying, but we are bonded together in this smirking joke.\u201d We talk about how that principle has been exported \u2013 with examples that include Donald Trump\u2019s more bizarre Twitter delusions to Boris Johnson\u2019s fantasies about making buses out of wine crates. The thread is that the joke is on those who would seek conventional truth; the punchline is that truth does not matter, when you have power. Prebble\u2019s play seeks to undermine that relationship. She puts Putin centre stage, initially as a kind of David Brent figure. \u201cHe is shorter than you think,\u201d reads her first stage direction about the president. \u201cI thought quite hard about whether or not to include him,\u201d she says. \u201cNot out of fear or anything, but because the mythologising is something he clearly enjoys.\u201d We live in a world, I say, increasingly dominated by authoritarian men whose greatest fears are being laughed at or ignored. \u201cWhat the play is about in some sense,\u201d she says, \u201cis how we manage male humiliation. All women know the dangers of being around a man who has been humiliated \u2013 it is an emotion that can shift quickly into anger and aggression. If that happens en masse, whether it is Russia after the cold war, or parts of Britain or the midwest after the collapse of manufacturing, it creates great potential for anger, and for the political forces that can exploit that.\u201d I last spoke to Prebble about some of those issues in an interview a decade ago, when her play Enron was in rehearsal at Islington. Looking back, she sees that symbolic corporate collapse and the banking crisis that it foreshadowed as the starting gun for our current polarised politics, particularly the populist determination to blame mass migration for austerity rather than the black hole created by millionaire money managers. Enron began as a great success story for her. Rupert Goold\u2019s production gained five-star critical acclaim and transferred for a sell-out season in the West End that made it seem a nailed-on hit for Broadway. In fact, however, after lukewarm previews and hostile reviews, the major New York production closed after only 10 days. That must have come as a shock? \u201cShock implies I was expecting it to go well,\u201d she says, with a quick laugh. \u201cAnd as my family would tell you, I don\u2019t approach life like that. I wish I did. But it wasn\u2019t just a critical mauling over there; audiences didn\u2019t like it.\u201d She is not completely sure why. It would be too easy, she insists, to say that the Americans didn\u2019t want a clever young British woman exposing and ridiculing the corruption of Wall Street. \u201cHamilton is the perfect American show,\u201d she says. \u201cThe struggle and the optimism and the triumph. It\u2019s brilliant. But I have a bleaker sensibility. For some people my plays can feel like being hit over the head with information all the time.\u201d Prebble wrote another play, The Effect, based on the clinical trial for a new anti-depressant, which among other things questioned whether emotion manipulated by chemicals was for real. After that there has been a seven-year gap until the Litvinenko play. Why was that? \u201cHonestly?\u201d Prebble says. \u201cThe truth is I had a really rough few years personally. I think I had a bit of a breakdown, looking back. I only use that word because that is exactly what it felt like.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to go into the specifics (\u201cit\u2019s not just my story\u201d) except to say \u201cI had a lot of loss in my life in a very short period\u201d. The result was that she became somewhat paralysed creatively. \u201cI thought depression was about smashing things up, or staying in bed all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut for me it was this kind of impossibility of making even the smallest decisions. It felt like there was no centre from which I was acting. I lost a lot of confidence.\u201d She found it harder and harder to write. She did a pilot for an HBO series starring Sarah Silverman, \u201csomeone I really admire and love\u201d. HBO dropped it. \u201cEveryone was looking to me to be the American idea of the showrunner,\u201d she says, \u201cand I was at my least confident at that point.\u201d What was the HBO story about? \u201cIt was a show about a woman who works in the computer-games industry and falls in love with a guy and moves to London to be with him. And finds herself being a stepmother to his kids and hating it. It was supposed to be funny but it came out bleak.\u201d As a result of that Prebble \u201chad that bad feeling that I\u2019d had a great opportunity and squandered it and felt the shame of that.\u201d There were other ideas that she tried to write but which didn\u2019t get a good reaction and were immediately abandoned. A few things helped her through that period, she says. One was friendship. She talks very warmly about her closeness to Billie Piper, the actress with whom she first worked on the ITV adaptation of The Secret Diary of a Call Girl \u2013 a difficult TV baptism for both of them. Piper also later starred in The Effect. Speaking later about her friendship with Prebble, Piper agrees with the playwright\u2019s suggestion that they are mutual muses as well as mates. \u201cAs much as I love Lucy as a person and care about her emotionally I am also really interested in her,\u201d Piper told me. \u201cShe fascinates me as a woman.\u201d Some of that fascination comes from watching Prebble work. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Piper says. \u201cLucy starts with really big themes. With The Effect it was about a drug trial and whether love was real or a placebo itself. A really big bold intellectual idea, but then she finds the human story in it.\u201d For a time, when Prebble was struggling, the pair of them \u201cwere constantly on the phone handling each other\u2019s emotional stuff.\u201d Piper had been on at her friend for years to work together again on TV \u201cbut the experience was so traumatic the first time around that it has taken this long to get back on board\u201d. The pair have been working on something for about three years that is finally going into production in the autumn. What is the story? \u201cIt is about two women in their 30s and how different that looks to being a woman in your 20s,\u201d Piper says. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been through our fair share of crisis and we want to see if we can speak a bit for our generation. Or at least that\u2019s the plan\u2026. \u201d It took Prebble a while to get herself back to the point where she was sure she had something to say. As well as friendships there were a couple of professional experiences that helped her to regain her writer\u2019s voice. The first was accepting an offer to work on a video game called, appropriately enough, Destiny, out in Seattle. Prebble went over to help them with their storytelling. She found the experience of playing a bit part to animators and designers \u201cvery comforting; also there was a child version of myself who was in love with video games\u201d. The second thing that helped to restore her confidence was the HBO series Succession. Jesse Armstrong\u2019s compulsive dynastic drama, which chronicles the comic machinations of a billionaire media family (with echoes of the Murdochs and the Redstones) evolved into a box-set King Lear. Prebble was initially approached to work on it by her American agent. \u201cThey said \u2018do you want to be a writer in the room?\u2019\u201d she recalls \u2013 no longer the lead. \u201cSo I went in at a little bit of a low ebb \u2013 but it was just the most life-changing, brilliant environment. That self-protective thing that can be common in theatre \u2013 \u2018don\u2019t mess with my words!\u2019 \u2013 wasn\u2019t there. All these brilliant comic writers would say, \u2018I\u2019ve written this but it\u2019s a bit shit, can you help?\u2019 I\u2019d never had that before but it was like coming home.\u201d Armstrong, the show\u2019s British creator, concurs: \u201cLucy is a dream collaborator. In a writing room you need to invest in the new idea totally, but then be prepared to disregard it brutally. She has a mixture of worldly omnivorous intelligence mixed with come-on-let\u2019s fix-this-enthusiasm. Also, funny.\u201d Prebble suggests she emerged from the team experience of writing the first series \u201calmost as if I had been rebuilt\u201d. Season two of Succession airs on 12 August; she has just finished work on the final episode. Prebble found another strand of conviction on social media. She has long been a caustic Twitterer. \u201cI withdrew to social media for a while,\u201d she says. \u201cAs someone very invested in games and tech as a kid, I felt like I was reminding myself of what sort of stuff I would say if I could say anything.\u201d She has, she says, tried to bring all of that spirit to her play. Without wanting to sound too grand, she suggests that it feels like a political moment to stand up and be counted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look back later in life and think: \u2018what was I doing then?\u2019\u201d she says. At the end of her play, she turns that challenge back to her audience. Much of the artifice that drives the play dissolves and the Marina Litvinenko character engages directly with the theatregoers. \u201cThere was a time when my absolute nightmare would have been some actor coming up and talking to me in the audience,\u201d Prebble says. \u201cAs I\u2019ve got older, and I\u2019ve been through lots of life experiences and done therapy I realise that those kinds of fears are not healthy. Not allowing yourself to take part and be vulnerable isn\u2019t good for you.\u201d You mean people should think about being actors as well as spectators in our current politics? \u201cExactly. So at the end of this \u2013 and it sounds wanky obviously \u2013 I wanted to make the point that we are all a bit responsible for the society we have created. \u2018Oh dearism\u2019 \u2013 that refrain that everything is bad and none of it is our fault \u2013 that is exactly what those in power want.\u201d She laughs, talks about some of the anxieties of dramatising those concerns with 25 actors. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d she says, returning to the rehearsal room in her head, \u201cThis is a risky, clumsy motherfucker, this play. If it goes down in flames, it goes down in flames. But,\u201d she says, \u201cI really think it is the right thing for now.\u201d A Very Expensive Poison runs at the Old Vic, London SE1, from 20 August until 5 October. Lucy Prebble, Marina Litvinenko and Luke Harding will discuss the poisoning at a Guardian Live event at Kings Place, London on 2 September. Book tickets at membership.theguardian.com",

The girls\u2019 parents, devout Catholics, argued that surgery was \u201cnot God\u2019s will\u201d. The surgery went ahead; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/05/sarahboseley\" title=\"\">Mary died, Jodie survived</a>.</p> <p>At an ethics committee meeting to discuss Marieme and Ndeye, Brierley raised the question of whether it would be right to go to court if the twins\u2019 father and the clinical team came to different conclusions.

Great Ormond Street had been very honest and very clear with me all the way. We came [to the hospital] as patients, but now we are more than that. I consider [the team] as family. I have never felt under pressure to agree to an operation. I have never been disrespected.\u201d</p> <p>Brierley described Ndiaye as an \u201cincredibly dignified, thoughtful, eloquent man and a wonderful father. You see those girls cherished, and they know they are cherished. It\u2019s an impossible situation for everyone involved, but he will live with his decision for the rest of his life.\u201d</p> <p>Ndiaye has been sustained by his faith as a Sufi Muslim. The Qur\u2019an tells him to be strong, honourable, dignified and patient in the face of hardship, he said. His wife has returned to Dakar and he has lost his job as a project manager in tourism and events. After granting him discretionary leave to stay in the UK, the Home Office moved Ndiaye and the girls to Cardiff. \u201cI have put everything on standby.

An <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/brexit-countdown-clock-delivered-to-downing-street/\" title=\"\">Armageddon Clock</a> has been installed at Conservative campaign headquarters counting down the time to Brexit by day, hour, minute and second. Another digital timepiece is to be installed in the prime minister\u2019s office.</p> <p>This is one of several theatrical props intended to supercharge the atmosphere. As if the stakes were not already vertiginous, they are being raised further as a conscious act of government policy. After a rummage down the back of the Treasury\u2019s sofa, Sajid Javid declares that he has found <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/sajid-javid-unveils-extra-2bn-to-turbo-charge-no-deal-brexit-preparations/\" title=\"\">another \u00a32bn</a> to add to the \u00a34bn-plus already committed to contingency planning for a crash-out Brexit. It is very doubtful whether that extra money can be sensibly deployed in the short time left before the end of October. To the government, announcing the money was the most important thing, making it one of the most expensive press releases in the history of political propagandising. We are told that Michael Gove is chairing daily meetings of the XS committee, the \u201cwar cabinet\u201d, to supposedly \u201cturbocharge\u201d preparations for no deal. And more than \u00a3100m will be consumed by one of the country\u2019s \u201cbiggest ever public information campaigns\u201d to warn everyone what they have to do to prepare for the worst.</p> <p>Who is all this Armageddon theatre designed for? Which audiences are expected to be influenced by making a drama of the crisis? The ramping up of fears that we are careering towards a no-deal Brexit has certainly made an impression on currency markets, where the pound has been sold down to its lowest level since the immediate aftermath of the shock of the referendum result in 2016. Companies are becoming more terrified that the menace of no-deal Brexit is a real one. The trade body representing car manufacturers warns that there is an <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy-autos/uk-new-car-sales-slump-ahead-of-brexit-existential-threat-idUKKCN1P10AX\" title=\"\">\u201cexistential threat\u201d</a> to the health of our largest goods industry, which accounts for the employment of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/07/31/brexit-fears-drive-collapse-car-industry-investment/\" title=\"\">a million people</a>. The National Farmers\u2019 Union forecasts the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-boris-johnson-sheep-wales-farming-no-deal-eu-mark-drakeford-a-a9027136.html\" title=\"\">mass slaughter</a> of cattle. Some on the Johnson team purport to be pleased that sterling is plunging, industry is quaking, farmers are frightened and nerves are shredding. They claim it as vindication of a strategy designed to convince everyone that a no-deal Brexit is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/19/what-a-no-deal-brexit-could-mean-for-the-uk-in-five-charts\" title=\"\">a serious prospect</a>, not just an expensive bluff so transparent that the EU will see through it.</p> <p>European leaders don\u2019t need an Armageddon Clock to tell them that we could be under 90 days away from a calamity Brexit. Mr Johnson is refusing to open negotiations \u2013 he has yet to even deign to meet them \u2013 until the EU concedes that the withdrawal agreement is dead. The EU is relentless in its insistence that they can\u2019t be reopened. Neither side is budging. I expect you\u2019d like to hear that this is posturing for public consumption while private backchannels have been quietly opened between Number 10 and European capitals to begin a conversation about finding a way forward that avoids disaster. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you that consolation. I\u2019m told by those who should know that the prime minister\u2019s envoys to the EU are simply repeating in private what he is megaphoning in public: there will be a crash-out Brexit if Europe does not blink.</p> <p>As he points the country at the cliff edge and depresses the accelerator, does prime minister Johnson have any idea where this will end? It is a mistake to think that he does. No one knows what he is really up to, including himself. In one breath, he tells us that this is<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/boris-johnson-donald-trump-brexit\" title=\"\"> \u201cdo or die\u201d</a>; in another, he sets the odds on a no-deal Brexit at <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/brexit/9605440/boris-johnson-no-deal-brexit-real-prospect-war-cabinet/\" title=\"\">\u201ca million to one\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65298b29e1e5c37a1cb53d3dee2bc59823633089\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65298b29e1e5c37a1cb53d3dee2bc59823633089/2021_226_1957_1174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage at Lord\u2019s in June\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage at Lord\u2019s in June: \u2018He declares that he does not trust the prime minister.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has to know that there is a strong possibility that it will mean an autumn general election. The least credible message from Number 10 is that it is not contemplating this outcome. The Vote Leave band has been reunited in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office ready to reprise the tunes that took it to a narrow win in 2016. We now have a government dominated by the frontmen of the Leave campaign and populated with its strategists. They gained their reputations not for their achievements at governing, but for their abilities at campaigning. What they did in the referendum they will seek to repeat at the election that may very soon be upon us. They will try to remobilise and reunite the coalition of voters that delivered them victory three years ago. That coalition fractured during Mrs May\u2019s prolonged and futile effort to find a Brexit deal that could secure the approval of parliament. If enough of it can be glued back together and marshalled behind the Tories, this offers what is probably their only plausible path to victory.</p> <p>Our recent Opinium poll did not locate a majority in the country for any one Brexit outcome. It did find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/27/boris-bounce-lifts-tories-at-expense-of-brexit-party-poll-shows\" title=\"\">45% of respondents</a> agreeing with the proposition that, if the withdrawal agreement can\u2019t be renegotiated, Britain should \u201cgo ahead with Brexit on 31 October even if it means leaving with no deal\u201d. And 45% is enough to win a parliamentary majority in the British system, especially if the opposition is fragmented and the alternative candidate for the premiership is extremely unpopular.</p> <p>Mrs May tried a more tepid version of this strategy at the outset of her \u201cI will deliver Brexit\u201d election in 2017. This backfired for many reasons. She was a campaigner so hopeless that she could not sell water to a man dying of thirst. Labour\u2019s face-both-ways position worked then, as fudging does not now, and Jeremy Corbyn successfully encouraged voters to think about issues other than Brexit. The few Tory gains made from Labour in Leave territories <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40209958\" title=\"\">such as Mansfield</a> weren\u2019t enough to compensate for the losses suffered by the Tories in strongly Remainer constituencies <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000549\" title=\"\">such as Battersea</a>. Those who think that Mr Johnson can succeed where she failed do so on the basis that opinion around Brexit has become more intensely polarised, that he is an infinitely superior retail politician to Mrs May, his campaign team is much sharper and Mr Corbyn\u2019s reputation has so decayed that he cannot repeat his expectations-surprising performance in 2017.</p> <p>This Tory strategy for winning an election makes some very big and risky assumptions. One is that the gains harvested by the Conservatives at the expense of Labour among Leave-supporting voters will outweigh Tory losses in Remain-supporting constituencies. Nearly every top Lib Dem target is a Conservative seat, while Scottish Nationalists are hoping to scalp <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40192707\" title=\"\">Tory MPs north of the border</a>. The other perilous assumption is that Nigel Farage\u2019s party will fade away or fold up. The leader of the Brexit party is enjoying being the object of renewed attention and displays no signs of wanting to retire again. He declares that <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/video/farage-ive-got-concerns-about-boris-11732916\" title=\"\">he does not trust the prime minister</a> and he has a bitter history of mutual loathing with Number 10\u2019s chief strategist, <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/nigel-farage-on-dominic-cummings-1-6192005\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a>.</p> <p>One lesson from the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-49200636\" title=\"\">Brecon &amp; Radnorshire</a> byelection is that the Brexit party doesn\u2019t have to do all that well \u2013 it polled barely a double-digit share on Thursday \u2013 to hurt the Tories. If the Conservatives could have added the Brexit party vote and that of Ukip to their tally, they would have held the seat with just over half the vote, rather than narrowly lose it to the Lib Dems. They\u2019d hope to put a harder squeeze on the Brexit party in a general election, but couldn\u2019t be absolutely confident. All the hazards of this strategy will be multiplied many times over if an election takes place after 31 October. In one scenario, we would still be in the EU, breaking the Tory leader\u2019s \u201cabsolute commitment\u201d to his party that Britain will be out \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d and hugely boosting the Faragists.</p> <p>In the alternative scenario, Britain has tumbled out of the EU without an agreement.

      "bodyText": "Those familiar with 24, the jeopardy TV series in which Kiefer Sutherland as Agent Jack Bauer is tasked with saving the world by any means necessary, will have had flashbacks. An Armageddon Clock has been installed at Conservative campaign headquarters counting down the time to Brexit by day, hour, minute and second. Another digital timepiece is to be installed in the prime minister\u2019s office. This is one of several theatrical props intended to supercharge the atmosphere. As if the stakes were not already vertiginous, they are being raised further as a conscious act of government policy. After a rummage down the back of the Treasury\u2019s sofa, Sajid Javid declares that he has found another \u00a32bn to add to the \u00a34bn-plus already committed to contingency planning for a crash-out Brexit. It is very doubtful whether that extra money can be sensibly deployed in the short time left before the end of October. To the government, announcing the money was the most important thing, making it one of the most expensive press releases in the history of political propagandising. We are told that Michael Gove is chairing daily meetings of the XS committee, the \u201cwar cabinet\u201d, to supposedly \u201cturbocharge\u201d preparations for no deal. And more than \u00a3100m will be consumed by one of the country\u2019s \u201cbiggest ever public information campaigns\u201d to warn everyone what they have to do to prepare for the worst. Who is all this Armageddon theatre designed for? Which audiences are expected to be influenced by making a drama of the crisis? The ramping up of fears that we are careering towards a no-deal Brexit has certainly made an impression on currency markets, where the pound has been sold down to its lowest level since the immediate aftermath of the shock of the referendum result in 2016. Companies are becoming more terrified that the menace of no-deal Brexit is a real one. The trade body representing car manufacturers warns that there is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the health of our largest goods industry, which accounts for the employment of a million people. The National Farmers\u2019 Union forecasts the mass slaughter of cattle. Some on the Johnson team purport to be pleased that sterling is plunging, industry is quaking, farmers are frightened and nerves are shredding. They claim it as vindication of a strategy designed to convince everyone that a no-deal Brexit is a serious prospect, not just an expensive bluff so transparent that the EU will see through it. European leaders don\u2019t need an Armageddon Clock to tell them that we could be under 90 days away from a calamity Brexit. Mr Johnson is refusing to open negotiations \u2013 he has yet to even deign to meet them \u2013 until the EU concedes that the withdrawal agreement is dead. The EU is relentless in its insistence that they can\u2019t be reopened. Neither side is budging. I expect you\u2019d like to hear that this is posturing for public consumption while private backchannels have been quietly opened between Number 10 and European capitals to begin a conversation about finding a way forward that avoids disaster. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you that consolation. I\u2019m told by those who should know that the prime minister\u2019s envoys to the EU are simply repeating in private what he is megaphoning in public: there will be a crash-out Brexit if Europe does not blink. As he points the country at the cliff edge and depresses the accelerator, does prime minister Johnson have any idea where this will end? It is a mistake to think that he does. No one knows what he is really up to, including himself. In one breath, he tells us that this is \u201cdo or die\u201d; in another, he sets the odds on a no-deal Brexit at \u201ca million to one\u201d. He has to know that there is a strong possibility that it will mean an autumn general election. The least credible message from Number 10 is that it is not contemplating this outcome. The Vote Leave band has been reunited in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office ready to reprise the tunes that took it to a narrow win in 2016. We now have a government dominated by the frontmen of the Leave campaign and populated with its strategists. They gained their reputations not for their achievements at governing, but for their abilities at campaigning. What they did in the referendum they will seek to repeat at the election that may very soon be upon us. They will try to remobilise and reunite the coalition of voters that delivered them victory three years ago. That coalition fractured during Mrs May\u2019s prolonged and futile effort to find a Brexit deal that could secure the approval of parliament. If enough of it can be glued back together and marshalled behind the Tories, this offers what is probably their only plausible path to victory. Our recent Opinium poll did not locate a majority in the country for any one Brexit outcome. It did find 45% of respondents agreeing with the proposition that, if the withdrawal agreement can\u2019t be renegotiated, Britain should \u201cgo ahead with Brexit on 31 October even if it means leaving with no deal\u201d. And 45% is enough to win a parliamentary majority in the British system, especially if the opposition is fragmented and the alternative candidate for the premiership is extremely unpopular. Mrs May tried a more tepid version of this strategy at the outset of her \u201cI will deliver Brexit\u201d election in 2017. This backfired for many reasons. She was a campaigner so hopeless that she could not sell water to a man dying of thirst. Labour\u2019s face-both-ways position worked then, as fudging does not now, and Jeremy Corbyn successfully encouraged voters to think about issues other than Brexit. The few Tory gains made from Labour in Leave territories such as Mansfield weren\u2019t enough to compensate for the losses suffered by the Tories in strongly Remainer constituencies such as Battersea. Those who think that Mr Johnson can succeed where she failed do so on the basis that opinion around Brexit has become more intensely polarised, that he is an infinitely superior retail politician to Mrs May, his campaign team is much sharper and Mr Corbyn\u2019s reputation has so decayed that he cannot repeat his expectations-surprising performance in 2017. This Tory strategy for winning an election makes some very big and risky assumptions. One is that the gains harvested by the Conservatives at the expense of Labour among Leave-supporting voters will outweigh Tory losses in Remain-supporting constituencies. Nearly every top Lib Dem target is a Conservative seat, while Scottish Nationalists are hoping to scalp Tory MPs north of the border. The other perilous assumption is that Nigel Farage\u2019s party will fade away or fold up. The leader of the Brexit party is enjoying being the object of renewed attention and displays no signs of wanting to retire again. He declares that he does not trust the prime minister and he has a bitter history of mutual loathing with Number 10\u2019s chief strategist, Dominic Cummings. One lesson from the Brecon &amp; Radnorshire byelection is that the Brexit party doesn\u2019t have to do all that well \u2013 it polled barely a double-digit share on Thursday \u2013 to hurt the Tories. If the Conservatives could have added the Brexit party vote and that of Ukip to their tally, they would have held the seat with just over half the vote, rather than narrowly lose it to the Lib Dems. They\u2019d hope to put a harder squeeze on the Brexit party in a general election, but couldn\u2019t be absolutely confident. All the hazards of this strategy will be multiplied many times over if an election takes place after 31 October. In one scenario, we would still be in the EU, breaking the Tory leader\u2019s \u201cabsolute commitment\u201d to his party that Britain will be out \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d and hugely boosting the Faragists. In the alternative scenario, Britain has tumbled out of the EU without an agreement. That is no longer a threat or a promise. The countdown has reached zero and no deal is a reality. Even in the less chilling versions of a crash-out Brexit \u2013 the ones that don\u2019t involve supermarket shelves being stripped bare by panic-buying and children dying for lack of life-critical medicines \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to be a prime minister trying to make a case for his re-election when the country has just suffered a big economic shock and the currency is collapsing. My suspicion is that the Armageddon Clock isn\u2019t really there to count down the seconds to Brexit day. It is there to remind Boris Johnson how long he has left before it becomes too late to avoid his own doomsday. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

Oliver Letwin, the former cabinet minister who has masterminded previous attempts to block a no-deal, was one of the few figures left in Westminster last week. And there have already been a series of leaks about the impact of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>Then there is the perceived instability of Johnson\u2019s new team.

      "bodyText": "The thrill of being thrown around a dusty wrestling ring, flipped over, then sat on isn\u2019t one I\u2019ve ever longed for. But Mercedez Blaze and Rebel Kinney, part-time warriors and full-time powerhouses, are determined to show me why wrestling isn\u2019t just a thing, but a feminist thing. Call it the effect of TV series Glow, the influence of the fitness mantra that \u201cstrong is the new skinny\u201d, or the fact that mainstream companies such as World Wrestling Entertainment and All Elite Wrestling have been forced to catch up with a fast-growing female audience, but women\u2019s wrestling is having a major moment in sports halls and gyms up and down the country. Blaze puts me in a headlock. It doesn\u2019t feel like a political act, but she\u2019s beautiful and smells like cocoa butter and I will believe anything she tells me. \u201cI grew up on wrestling, it raised me, it\u2019s my third parent,\u201d she says gleefully. \u201cThen I made my debut two years ago and now look at me.\u201d My head is squished somewhere near her boobs. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt stronger or more confident than I do now.

      "body": "<p>It should be the start of the holiday but for too many travellers the airport marks the start of a nightmare. The recent heatwave across Europe brought thunderstorms which left thousands stranded in UK airports having to endure cancellations and delays with many sleeping on the floor as hotels ran out of space.</p> <p>And the coming weeks could see a series of further disruptions with the possibility of strikes looming. This week, the results of a ballot of members of Ryanair\u2019s pilot union will emerge after a vote on strike action in a dispute over working conditions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, possible strikes by British Airways pilots could also cause disruption after the airline lost a second legal attempt to block industrial action last week.</p> <p>So what consumer rights do travellers need to be aware of?</p> <h2>Delayed for take-off</h2> <p>European Union law kicks in for passengers on flights which originate in the EU or arrive there and are operated by an EU airline.</p> <p>The next question is how long was the delay. If more than two hours for short-haul (less than 1,500km), three hours for a medium-haul (1,500-3,500km) and more than four hours for long-haul (over 3,500km), then passengers are entitled to food, drink and access to communications such as a phone, as well as accommodation if the delay is overnight. If it is for more than five hours, passengers are entitled to a refund if they don\u2019t want to travel any more.</p> <p>Compensation may be due if the fault was the airline\u2019s. \u201cFor instance, you can probably claim if the delay was caused by poor aircraft maintenance or flight crew being unavailable,\u201d says the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). \u201cHowever, delays caused by things like extreme weather, air traffic control or airport employee strikes, situations where the entire airport was closed or other \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 are not eligible for compensation.\u201d</p> <p>Levels of compensation are again dictated by distance and time and range from \u20ac250 for a three-hour delay on a short-haul flight to \u20ac600 for delays of more than four hours on a long-haul journey.</p> <h2>Cancelled outright</h2> <p>If a flight is cancelled, passengers can\u2019t be left stranded. Under EU laws, they can get their money back for the parts of the ticket which have not been used, such as a leg of a return ticket. If they still want to fly, then the airline is obliged to find another flight, whether it be as soon as possible or at a later date.</p> <p>If flights are extremely heavily booked, travellers may find that the next flight available is several days away. Compensation may be available if less than 14 days notice of the cancellation is given, but this again depends on the cause, with the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d get-out a possibility.</p> <p>If compensation is available, it again depends on distance and time, going from \u20ac125 for a flight that arrives two hours later than an original short-haul flight was expected, to the \u20ac600 for a long-haul replacement flight that arrives four hours later than the original was expected.</p> <h2>Will strikes stop the rules?</h2> <p>With the prospect of strikes looming, it is good practice for travellers to know where they stand if they face delays or have their flights cancelled. Airlines are not normally obliged to offer compensation as strikes are deemed extraordinary circumstances. This is not always the case, however.</p> <p>\u201cUnder EU rules, strikes may be considered as \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019, which means the airline does not have to pay compensation. To be exempted from paying compensation, the airline must prove that: A, there is a link between the extraordinary circumstances and the delay or the cancellation; and B, the delay or cancellation could not have been avoided, even if all reasonable measures had been taken,\u201d according to the European Commission\u2019s Europa.eu. If passengers are unhappy with the explanation, they should contact the CAA.</p> <p>Naomi Leach of Which? says that in the case of strikes by BA and Ryanair staff, there may be compensation due. \u201cIf delays or cancellations are a result of the airline\u2019s own staff striking, passengers may be entitled to fixed compensation under EU law as this won\u2019t usually be considered an extraordinary circumstance,\u201d she adds.</p> <h2>Does my travel insurer need to be involved?</h2> <p>The first port of call when seeking redress for delays or cancellation should be the airline, not the travel insurer, which is unlikely to be of much help, according to Which? \u201cIt is worth checking what travel insurance you already have \u2013 many bank accounts, for example, may include holiday cover. But even if your travel insurance policy does offer compensation for a delay, in most cases this will only cover extra expenses such as food and drink at the airport,\u201d says Leach.</p> <p>In the case of holidays having to be abandoned as a result of severe delays or cancellations at a busy time, such as during the calamitous drone incident at Gatwick last year, a decent travel insurance policy should cover the cost of travellers having to abandon their plans \u2013 including hotel and car hire cancellation at their destination.</p> <p>The devil is in the detail, however. Research from GoCompare.com shows that 90% of policies offer some cover for abandoning a holiday after an extended delay (typically 12 to 24 hours) with maximum payouts ranging from \u00a3250 to \u00a312,500, with most bunched around \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000.</p> <h2>Do I need help to claim compensation?</h2> <p>A number of sites, such as Martin Lewis\u2019s MoneySavingExpert and Which?, have helpful tools and generic letters. You can claim from an airline direct free of charge but that, of course, has not stopped a mini industry of \u201cclaims management firms\u201d charging heavy fees. Some pocket more than 40% of any payout, although they have no special powers to pursue claims.</p>",

The recent heatwave across Europe brought thunderstorms which left thousands stranded in UK airports having to endure cancellations and delays with many sleeping on the floor as hotels ran out of space. And the coming weeks could see a series of further disruptions with the possibility of strikes looming. This week, the results of a ballot of members of Ryanair\u2019s pilot union will emerge after a vote on strike action in a dispute over working conditions. Meanwhile, possible strikes by British Airways pilots could also cause disruption after the airline lost a second legal attempt to block industrial action last week. So what consumer rights do travellers need to be aware of? Delayed for take-off European Union law kicks in for passengers on flights which originate in the EU or arrive there and are operated by an EU airline. The next question is how long was the delay. If more than two hours for short-haul (less than 1,500km), three hours for a medium-haul (1,500-3,500km) and more than four hours for long-haul (over 3,500km), then passengers are entitled to food, drink and access to communications such as a phone, as well as accommodation if the delay is overnight. If it is for more than five hours, passengers are entitled to a refund if they don\u2019t want to travel any more. Compensation may be due if the fault was the airline\u2019s. \u201cFor instance, you can probably claim if the delay was caused by poor aircraft maintenance or flight crew being unavailable,\u201d says the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). \u201cHowever, delays caused by things like extreme weather, air traffic control or airport employee strikes, situations where the entire airport was closed or other \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 are not eligible for compensation.\u201d Levels of compensation are again dictated by distance and time and range from \u20ac250 for a three-hour delay on a short-haul flight to \u20ac600 for delays of more than four hours on a long-haul journey. Cancelled outright If a flight is cancelled, passengers can\u2019t be left stranded. Under EU laws, they can get their money back for the parts of the ticket which have not been used, such as a leg of a return ticket. If they still want to fly, then the airline is obliged to find another flight, whether it be as soon as possible or at a later date. If flights are extremely heavily booked, travellers may find that the next flight available is several days away. Compensation may be available if less than 14 days notice of the cancellation is given, but this again depends on the cause, with the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d get-out a possibility. If compensation is available, it again depends on distance and time, going from \u20ac125 for a flight that arrives two hours later than an original short-haul flight was expected, to the \u20ac600 for a long-haul replacement flight that arrives four hours later than the original was expected. Will strikes stop the rules? With the prospect of strikes looming, it is good practice for travellers to know where they stand if they face delays or have their flights cancelled. Airlines are not normally obliged to offer compensation as strikes are deemed extraordinary circumstances. This is not always the case, however. \u201cUnder EU rules, strikes may be considered as \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019, which means the airline does not have to pay compensation. To be exempted from paying compensation, the airline must prove that: A, there is a link between the extraordinary circumstances and the delay or the cancellation; and B, the delay or cancellation could not have been avoided, even if all reasonable measures had been taken,\u201d according to the European Commission\u2019s Europa.eu. If passengers are unhappy with the explanation, they should contact the CAA. Naomi Leach of Which? says that in the case of strikes by BA and Ryanair staff, there may be compensation due. \u201cIf delays or cancellations are a result of the airline\u2019s own staff striking, passengers may be entitled to fixed compensation under EU law as this won\u2019t usually be considered an extraordinary circumstance,\u201d she adds. Does my travel insurer need to be involved? The first port of call when seeking redress for delays or cancellation should be the airline, not the travel insurer, which is unlikely to be of much help, according to Which? \u201cIt is worth checking what travel insurance you already have \u2013 many bank accounts, for example, may include holiday cover. But even if your travel insurance policy does offer compensation for a delay, in most cases this will only cover extra expenses such as food and drink at the airport,\u201d says Leach. In the case of holidays having to be abandoned as a result of severe delays or cancellations at a busy time, such as during the calamitous drone incident at Gatwick last year, a decent travel insurance policy should cover the cost of travellers having to abandon their plans \u2013 including hotel and car hire cancellation at their destination. The devil is in the detail, however. Research from GoCompare.com shows that 90% of policies offer some cover for abandoning a holiday after an extended delay (typically 12 to 24 hours) with maximum payouts ranging from \u00a3250 to \u00a312,500, with most bunched around \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000. Do I need help to claim compensation? A number of sites, such as Martin Lewis\u2019s MoneySavingExpert and Which?, have helpful tools and generic letters. You can claim from an airline direct free of charge but that, of course, has not stopped a mini industry of \u201cclaims management firms\u201d charging heavy fees. Some pocket more than 40% of any payout, although they have no special powers to pursue claims.",

In 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia to crack down on reformist trends, and was still holding its own in the space race with the United States.

Implicitly referencing the current tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade, and the difficulties Australia faces balancing its most important security relationship with its most important economic relationship, Trump\u2019s secretary of state said the US was not in the business of \u201casking nations to choose between the United States and China\u201d. The secretary of state noted Australia had \u201ccourageously and independently raised the alarm about the risk of China\u2019s 5G ambitions before we caught on\u201d and America and Australia were both concerned about China\u2019s militarisation of their manmade islands in the South China Sea. Esper\u2019s language was more forceful. On the back of Trump threatening to impose new tariffs on $300bn worth of Chinese goods (the latest sortie in the tit-for-tat trade war between Washington and Beijing that has rattled global financial markets), the defence secretary declared in Sydney the US stood against a \u201cdisturbing pattern of aggressive behaviour\u201d by China. This behaviour, Esper said, included \u201cpredatory economics\u201d and the promotion of \u201cstate-sponsored theft of other nations\u2019 intellectual property\u201d. \u201cIn the Indo-Pacific, power should not determine position and that should not determine destiny,\u201d Esper said. \u201cThe US will not stand by idly while any one nation attempts to reshape the region to its favour at the expense of others. \u201cWe know that our allies and partners would not either.\u201d Esper also commended Australia\u2019s Pacific step up (the Morrison government\u2019s more proactive stance on aid and development in the Pacific), which is a response to China\u2019s diplomatic courtship in the region. The US defence secretary said the step up \u201cmirrors our own engagement in the region and together we remain committed to maintaining the openness of the global commons\u201d. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said America\u2019s military presence in the Pacific had been a force stability for decades, and China was also a vitally important strategic partner for Australia. \u201cIt is not in anybody\u2019s interest for the Indo-Pacific to become adversarial in character, so we work closely with our key partners, with our strongest alliance partner, the US, and our key trading partner, China, to pursue those issues of stability and security and prosperity,\u201d Payne said.",

But if you wanted proof that writing can rise above what it describes, this is it. The book is a buoy on troubled water (not at all the same as a bridge over it). It is indecently entertaining: there are moments when one feels guilty for enjoying the writing so much.

Little did I realise how much reason he had for pacing in his own life.</p> <p>At this point, his mother should step forward to take a bow. She is the book\u2019s heroine. She had no idea what had happened to her son (and if he is OK now, she can probably take some credit).

He shockingly explains, too, how the trauma of it has wiped his memory. It is ironic that the drama school he got into \u2013 Drama Centre \u2013 had earned itself the nickname \u201cTrauma Centre\u201d. Of his decision to act, he writes: \u201cI did what anyone with low self-esteem and an ambivalent relationship to visibility does. I decided to become a professional actor.\u201d He amusingly describes the way in which trainee actors are encouraged to lose several skins (go back to zero, start afresh).</p> <p>It is tempting to think his writing might have profited from this training: his prose has its naked moments, with jokes as fig leaves. Samadder insists he wanted to become a Casanova at drama school and lets us in on his chat-up routine: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m a bad boy,\u2019 I\u2019d murmur huskily, \u2018You\u2019re funny,\u2019 the ladies would often respond, which was confusing but still broadly positive.\u201d The ladies were right, and Samadder has since evolved irresistibly from stage to page.

And the moment in which he plucks up the courage to ask his mother about his grandmother\u2019s depression has an incongruity to rival the Bangkok hotel. It is outside Hamleys, at Christmas, that he yells: \u201cWHAT MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS DID YOUR MUM HAVE WAS IT SCHIZOPHRENIA OR DEPRESSION OR WHAT?\u201d Later, Loch Lomond features \u2013 an inappropriately picturesque setting for a further heavy conversation \u2013 a reminder of life\u2019s obliviousness to personal tribulation. Yet Samadder never uses jokes to hide from horror and writes bravely about abuse. He shockingly explains, too, how the trauma of it has wiped his memory. It is ironic that the drama school he got into \u2013 Drama Centre \u2013 had earned itself the nickname \u201cTrauma Centre\u201d. Of his decision to act, he writes: \u201cI did what anyone with low self-esteem and an ambivalent relationship to visibility does. I decided to become a professional actor.\u201d He amusingly describes the way in which trainee actors are encouraged to lose several skins (go back to zero, start afresh). It is tempting to think his writing might have profited from this training: his prose has its naked moments, with jokes as fig leaves. Samadder insists he wanted to become a Casanova at drama school and lets us in on his chat-up routine: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m a bad boy,\u2019 I\u2019d murmur huskily, \u2018You\u2019re funny,\u2019 the ladies would often respond, which was confusing but still broadly positive.\u201d The ladies were right, and Samadder has since evolved irresistibly from stage to page. He even turned journalist and contributed a successful \u201cInspect a Gadget\u201d column to the Guardian (his review of the ridiculous Egg Master made him an internet darling), and now writes on wellness devices and fads. Here, though, he reviews ways of coping with depression with the same wit with which he approaches gadgetry and an acknowledgment that anything that aims to combat depression is worthy of serious consideration. Towards the end of the book, he writes: \u201cAdvice is like being handed a large amount of foreign currency. What do you do with it?\u201d He knows how to convert it and offers readers (especially depressed ones) more than a handful of change. He considers the \u201cwhy bother?\u201d of depression that can \u201cstop one working, or socialising, or eating\u201d and does not peddle false cheer: \u201cThere are no answers given to us as to why we should do anything.\u201d But the tip he passes on at the end of the book (part of a longer, darker sentence) is all the more upbeat for having been learned the hard way: \u201cStay open because life only gets richer as it unfolds.\u201d \u2022 I Never Said I Loved You by Rhik Samadder is published by Headline (\u00a314.99).

Gwen Verdon, not a name now famed in Hollywood, was the horrendously talented dancer who, despite having rickets and leg braces as a toddler (earning the lovely nickname \u201cGimpy\u201d), acquired four Tony awards and, incidentally, taught the likes of Lana Turner, Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe to dance. Importantly, she acted as muse, co-choreographer and sometime wife to the better-known Bob Fosse, the alcoholic, chain-smoking, obsessive, egoist director who gave us in-turned knees and \u201cjazz hands\u201d and <em>Sweet </em><em>Charity</em> and <em>Cabaret</em> and <em>Chicago</em>.</p> <p>Yet Verdon was no less obsessive in her own manic attention to detail \u2013 there\u2019s one grand sequence, in the double bill that aired last night, where she flies from Berlin to New York and back just to pick out a monkey costume. She rightly identifies Fosse\u2019s If You Could See Her as utterly <em>not</em> requiring a comedy chimp suit, but the prettiest damn chimp imaginable. The result, an overall darker and cleverer take on <em>Cabaret</em> than the producers had ever wanted Fosse to take, can be seen for posterity; Joel Grey\u2019s hissed final line \u2013 \u201cshe voodent look Jewishhh at all\u201d \u2013 can still evoke shivers.</p> <p>This is a phenomenal treatment of a truly engaging story, and a time, which now seems just glimpsed out of the half-blinked corner of an eye. It\u2019s filmed lushly, with gleeful panache, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/05/michelle-williams-take-this-waltz-interview\" title=\"\">Michelle Williams</a> is never less than wonderful as the absurdly overlooked Verdon. Sam Rockwell is an actor gutsily confident enough in his own looks to be able to pull off the worst comb-over since Gregor Fisher\u2019s 1980s Hamlet ad, and still think it sexy, but he had such just-so style, and the hats, and the smoking, and the lanky legs and well-cut trousering, that he (almost) made it so.

      "bodyText": "Fosse/Verdon (BBC Two) | iPlayer How to Break Into the Elite (BBC Two) | iPlayer Young, British and Depressed (C4) | All4 In new eight-part drama Fosse/Verdon, we find a long overdue omission from history finally and thankfully rectified in quite some style. Gwen Verdon, not a name now famed in Hollywood, was the horrendously talented dancer who, despite having rickets and leg braces as a toddler (earning the lovely nickname \u201cGimpy\u201d), acquired four Tony awards and, incidentally, taught the likes of Lana Turner, Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe to dance. Importantly, she acted as muse, co-choreographer and sometime wife to the better-known Bob Fosse, the alcoholic, chain-smoking, obsessive, egoist director who gave us in-turned knees and \u201cjazz hands\u201d and Sweet Charity and Cabaret and Chicago. Yet Verdon was no less obsessive in her own manic attention to detail \u2013 there\u2019s one grand sequence, in the double bill that aired last night, where she flies from Berlin to New York and back just to pick out a monkey costume. She rightly identifies Fosse\u2019s If You Could See Her as utterly not requiring a comedy chimp suit, but the prettiest damn chimp imaginable. The result, an overall darker and cleverer take on Cabaret than the producers had ever wanted Fosse to take, can be seen for posterity; Joel Grey\u2019s hissed final line \u2013 \u201cshe voodent look Jewishhh at all\u201d \u2013 can still evoke shivers. This is a phenomenal treatment of a truly engaging story, and a time, which now seems just glimpsed out of the half-blinked corner of an eye. It\u2019s filmed lushly, with gleeful panache, and Michelle Williams is never less than wonderful as the absurdly overlooked Verdon. Sam Rockwell is an actor gutsily confident enough in his own looks to be able to pull off the worst comb-over since Gregor Fisher\u2019s 1980s Hamlet ad, and still think it sexy, but he had such just-so style, and the hats, and the smoking, and the lanky legs and well-cut trousering, that he (almost) made it so. It reminded me a lot of that grand series Feud of a couple of years ago: one of those stars, Jessica Lange (Joan Crawford), apparently spent a while with the dreadful but engaging rou\u00e9 Fosse in his dwindling years. But it\u2019s in the rekindling of Verdon that this series\u2019 strength lies: in the story behind the films, we are roughly awakened to what was really going on inside female lives in Hollywood Babylon in the 60s and 70s. It includes an astounding turn by Kelli Barrett as Ms Minnelli, reaching many growly plateaus that Liza-with-a-Z could have only aspired to, but this is merely one joy among many: a dark, sophisticated delight. There were so many stats swimming around last week in a couple of honestly valuable programmes that I began to fear I was being circled by fact-sharks, but a few still permeated. The least eye-opening, sadly, was that a 2:2 degree obtained by the \u201cright\u201d sort \u2013 normally white, posh-ish, with \u201csoft skills\u201d, such as unflappable if misplaced confidence in one\u2019s own abilities \u2013 is more likely to get an entry, even a look-in, to a high-paying job than a working-class equivalent with a first.

I hope this is followed up in six months and there\u2019s far better news, but I also hope that, while accepting very few folk are immune to a certain flawless easy charm, I find myself increasingly wishing it was not so. Sanah Ahsan, somewhat bravely, tackled the subject of mental health in another must-watch of a programme, Young, British and Depressed, at a febrile time when to even question, say, whether young people have definable medicalised \u201cproblems\u201d, rather than are just, say, going through exams and adolescence, is to risk accusations of belittling or, worse, stigmatising their troubles.

(The first series of <em>The Tip Off</em> barely featured any male reporters at all.) And third, that no one can predict how a story will land.</p> <p>Sometimes investigations result in a big media splash; sometimes they make barely a ripple. The opening episode of the new series, which started this week, features one story that did both. In it, we meet <em>Chicago</em><em> Sun-Times</em> journalist Jim DeRogatis, who, with another reporter, Abdon Pallasch, first reported on R&amp;B megastar R Kelly\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of young women. Their front-page story was published way back in 2000, to deafening silence. Over the next 17 years, DeRogatis reported on 48 women who alleged that Kelly had raped or sexually abused them. But these stories \u2013 backed up, corroborated, evidenced \u2013 were ignored by other media outlets. Even a \u201ccrystal-clear\u201d video of Kelly abusing an underage girl, sent to DeRogatis anonymously and resulting in a legal case (Kelly was acquitted), was joked about as a \u201cpee tape\u201d. Only in post-#MeToo 2017, when Buzzfeed ran with DeRogatis\u2019s story of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jimderogatis/i-thought-the-world-would-never-know-about-r-kelly\" title=\"\">women being held against their will at Kelly\u2019s home</a>, did the wider world take notice.</p> <p>Kelly has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/12/r-kelly-arrested-on-federal-sex-trafficking-charges\" title=\"\">recently been indicted on 18 charges</a> including child sexual exploitation, child pornography, kidnapping and obstruction of justice. But, as yet, he\u2019s not been found guilty. You have to wonder, as DeRogatis points out, if this story would have attracted more attention if just one of Kelly\u2019s alleged victims had been white.</p> <p>A new investigative journalism offering is <strong><a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/podcasts/2019/07/31/bellingcat-podcast-mh17-episode-3-guide-the-murder-weapon/\" title=\"\">The Bellingcat Podcast</a></strong>. Bellingcat is an independent investigative website that uses open-source journalism and social media to probe a variety of international stories. This is its first podcast and it concerns <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17\" title=\"\">Malaysian Airlines </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17\" title=\"\">flight MH17</a>, which was shot down in Ukraine in 2014. Presented by Eliot Higgins, Bellingcat\u2019s founder, this is detailed stuff, with any number of informed interviewees, from reporters on the scene (the opening episode is disturbing in its eerie detail), to experienced analysts of Russian and Ukrainian politics. We\u2019re three episodes in. In episode 2, I was struck by political expert Mark Galeotti, talking about Russian online counterintelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to attack each individual lie\u2026 and prove it isn\u2019t so, but in the process it creates this sense that truth is entirely subjective and negotiable.\u201d Bellingcat is all about non-negotiable truth. The podcast goes in deep, but for those who wish to join in, it\u2019s definitely worth the effort.</p> <h2>Three shows celebrating their Rajar ratings</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wr34\" title=\"\">Ken Bruce</a></strong><br><strong>BBC Radio 2<br></strong>With a proportion of Radio 2 listeners following Chris Evans to Virgin (where Evans\u2019s breakfast show has increased listeners to a steady 1.1 million), and others migrating to 6 Music\u2019s Lauren Laverne, Zoe Ball has done well to keep Radio 2\u2019s breakfast show above 8 million listeners. That means, though, that Ken Bruce now has the biggest show in the UK, with 8.5 million listeners tuning in to his genial mix of well-known tunes and even more well-known jokes.

In London, his show is the No 1 commercial radio show for \u201chours and share\u201d: meaning people listen longer to him than most other hosts. Elsewhere on LBC, Eddie Mair\u2019s teatime show has added 119,000 listeners, with 804,000 tuning in every week.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.unionjack.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Union Jack</a></strong><br><strong>Jack Radio<br></strong>Not shows, but stations without traditional DJs, this is one of the Oxfordshire-based Jack FM network\u2019s two stations.

Their front-page story was published way back in 2000, to deafening silence. Over the next 17 years, DeRogatis reported on 48 women who alleged that Kelly had raped or sexually abused them. But these stories \u2013 backed up, corroborated, evidenced \u2013 were ignored by other media outlets. Even a \u201ccrystal-clear\u201d video of Kelly abusing an underage girl, sent to DeRogatis anonymously and resulting in a legal case (Kelly was acquitted), was joked about as a \u201cpee tape\u201d. Only in post-#MeToo 2017, when Buzzfeed ran with DeRogatis\u2019s story of women being held against their will at Kelly\u2019s home, did the wider world take notice. Kelly has recently been indicted on 18 charges including child sexual exploitation, child pornography, kidnapping and obstruction of justice. But, as yet, he\u2019s not been found guilty. You have to wonder, as DeRogatis points out, if this story would have attracted more attention if just one of Kelly\u2019s alleged victims had been white. A new investigative journalism offering is The Bellingcat Podcast. Bellingcat is an independent investigative website that uses open-source journalism and social media to probe a variety of international stories. This is its first podcast and it concerns Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down in Ukraine in 2014. Presented by Eliot Higgins, Bellingcat\u2019s founder, this is detailed stuff, with any number of informed interviewees, from reporters on the scene (the opening episode is disturbing in its eerie detail), to experienced analysts of Russian and Ukrainian politics. We\u2019re three episodes in. In episode 2, I was struck by political expert Mark Galeotti, talking about Russian online counterintelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to attack each individual lie\u2026 and prove it isn\u2019t so, but in the process it creates this sense that truth is entirely subjective and negotiable.\u201d Bellingcat is all about non-negotiable truth. The podcast goes in deep, but for those who wish to join in, it\u2019s definitely worth the effort. Three shows celebrating their Rajar ratings Ken Bruce BBC Radio 2 With a proportion of Radio 2 listeners following Chris Evans to Virgin (where Evans\u2019s breakfast show has increased listeners to a steady 1.1 million), and others migrating to 6 Music\u2019s Lauren Laverne, Zoe Ball has done well to keep Radio 2\u2019s breakfast show above 8 million listeners. That means, though, that Ken Bruce now has the biggest show in the UK, with 8.5 million listeners tuning in to his genial mix of well-known tunes and even more well-known jokes. Even the sniffy (like me) are fans of Bruce\u2019s PopMaster quiz. Retaining a Wogan-esque relaxed charm, he is the antidote to the bad news world. Nick Ferrari LBC LBC\u2019s long-standing breakfast-show provocateur has posted his highest ever figures, with 1.4 million listeners, an increase of 240,000. Ferrari is one of the best out there at dealing with both politicians and voters, adept at playing devil\u2019s advocate without making his interviewees feel foolish or unacknowledged. In London, his show is the No 1 commercial radio show for \u201chours and share\u201d: meaning people listen longer to him than most other hosts. Elsewhere on LBC, Eddie Mair\u2019s teatime show has added 119,000 listeners, with 804,000 tuning in every week. Union Jack Jack Radio Not shows, but stations without traditional DJs, this is one of the Oxfordshire-based Jack FM network\u2019s two stations. Union Jack, which plays British pop music, has had a 74% increase in listeners year-on-year, up to 153,000. Jack Radio, which plays only female artists, got a smaller listenership of 32,000, but both stations are perhaps a forecast of what is to come. Geoff Lloyd\u2019s Hometown Glory, an interview show, is played on the network and there is live comedy too, but commercial DJs may well be quaking in their boots.",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a special emotional bond with the films we discover as children that is somehow purer, more cherishable than anything we forge later in life. For me, a bedrock moment in my love of cinema was working my way through a box of VHS copies of 1930s musicals, mesmerised by the glittering repartee and the effortless elegance of old Hollywood. Even now, watching clips of Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers and Eleanor Powell tap routines is a shortcut to a happy place. But, as shown by the response to Mark Kermode\u2019s excellent and very personal list of 25 of the best films for children published here two weeks ago, everyone has their own treasured childhood movie touchstone.</p> <p>The replies to the list include passionately argued cases for everything from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/22/who-framed-roger-rabbit-at-30-the-game-changer-hollywood-couldnt-top\" title=\"\">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></em> (which would definitely make my own roll call of best children\u2019s films) and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/23/the-princess-bride-review-rob-reiner\" title=\"\">The Princess Bride</a></em> (likewise) to the Roberto Benigni-starring holocaust drama <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/life-is-beautiful\" title=\"\">Life Is Beautiful</a></em> (not so much). But the point of Mark\u2019s list, and the aspect that makes it such a rewarding read, was the decision to embrace the scope of family cinema at its broadest possible interpretation. As anyone with children under 10 will no doubt concur, much of the more recent content targeted at younger audiences represents a world of pain for older ones \u2013 just gaze into the hollow, haunted eyes of any adult who has had to endure <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/06/the-emoji-movie-observer-review\" title=\"\">The Emoji Movie</a></em>.</p> <p>Rather than churned out bargain-basement kids\u2019 movies, the audience is far better served by films that emphasise the \u201cfamily\u201d in family entertainment \u2013 a collective, unifying experience to be shared and enjoyed by all ages. This might entail taking children out of their comfort zone a little, with subtitles or silent films; with the wrenchingly sad ending of <em>Kes</em>, for example or, to give a more recent example, the genuinely scary peril in <em>Paddington</em>, another film that was a popular choice with readers. Nicole Kidman as a renegade taxidermist lovingly stroking her glinting arsenal of scalpels while Paddington lies unconscious provides a shiveringly terrifying moment.</p> <p>But as someone whose formative childhood movie experiences included a possibly unhealthy degree of tap-dancing, I was particularly delighted to see the support for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/singin-in-the-rain\" title=\"\">Singin\u2019 in </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/singin-in-the-rain\" title=\"\">the Rain</a></em> in the readers\u2019 responses. It\u2019s a terrific suggestion, and one that goes to the top of my movie-night viewing list of film treasures to share with my eight-year-old. <strong>Wendy Ide</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx2DBvmwul8\" title=\"\">Bedknobs and Broomsticks</a> (1971)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29e5636ae79aa3dbfc0eea6418f184b148821335\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29e5636ae79aa3dbfc0eea6418f184b148821335/0_83_1332_799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Tomlinson and Angela Lansbury in Bedknobs and Broomsticks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Tomlinson and Angela Lansbury in Bedknobs and Broomsticks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Disney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Blitz-era musical fantasy starring Angela Lansbury as a witchcraft-practi</strong><strong>sing governess</strong><br>\u201cThat football scene will always be a delight.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a special emotional bond with the films we discover as children that is somehow purer, more cherishable than anything we forge later in life. For me, a bedrock moment in my love of cinema was working my way through a box of VHS copies of 1930s musicals, mesmerised by the glittering repartee and the effortless elegance of old Hollywood. Even now, watching clips of Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers and Eleanor Powell tap routines is a shortcut to a happy place. But, as shown by the response to Mark Kermode\u2019s excellent and very personal list of 25 of the best films for children published here two weeks ago, everyone has their own treasured childhood movie touchstone. The replies to the list include passionately argued cases for everything from Who Framed Roger Rabbit (which would definitely make my own roll call of best children\u2019s films) and The Princess Bride (likewise) to the Roberto Benigni-starring holocaust drama Life Is Beautiful (not so much). But the point of Mark\u2019s list, and the aspect that makes it such a rewarding read, was the decision to embrace the scope of family cinema at its broadest possible interpretation. As anyone with children under 10 will no doubt concur, much of the more recent content targeted at younger audiences represents a world of pain for older ones \u2013 just gaze into the hollow, haunted eyes of any adult who has had to endure The Emoji Movie. Rather than churned out bargain-basement kids\u2019 movies, the audience is far better served by films that emphasise the \u201cfamily\u201d in family entertainment \u2013 a collective, unifying experience to be shared and enjoyed by all ages. This might entail taking children out of their comfort zone a little, with subtitles or silent films; with the wrenchingly sad ending of Kes, for example or, to give a more recent example, the genuinely scary peril in Paddington, another film that was a popular choice with readers. Nicole Kidman as a renegade taxidermist lovingly stroking her glinting arsenal of scalpels while Paddington lies unconscious provides a shiveringly terrifying moment. But as someone whose formative childhood movie experiences included a possibly unhealthy degree of tap-dancing, I was particularly delighted to see the support for Singin\u2019 in the Rain in the readers\u2019 responses. It\u2019s a terrific suggestion, and one that goes to the top of my movie-night viewing list of film treasures to share with my eight-year-old. Wendy Ide Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) Blitz-era musical fantasy starring Angela Lansbury as a witchcraft-practising governess \u201cThat football scene will always be a delight. As well as the comedy, Bedknobs may have been the first time many children were introduced to war coming to our doorsteps and the real impact of the war on children not many generations before them.\u201d stuckinazoo The Princess Bride (1987) William Goldman\u2019s wry fairytale adventure, in which a farmhand must rescue a princess \u201cThe film that has everything: Fred Savage, Columbo, a giant, Billy Crystal, Robin Wright (grrrr), magic, sword fights. Has to be more engaging for kids than Kes, surely.\u201d June Junes Singin\u2019 in the Rain (1952) Effervescent classic musical with Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds as silent film stars struggling to make a talkie \u201cI saw Singin\u2019 in the Rain as a child in a cinema (in the early 70s, a rerelease), walked into the theatre as a six or seven year old, not having a clue of what I was about to see (other than it looked like a happy movie), and by the end credits I was in heaven. It is the one film that changed my life for the better and it has not a single sad moment in it. The film I treasure the most.\u201d Nebelglanz Watership Down (1978) An animated tale of rabbits in peril, based on the unsettling 1972 novel by Richard Adams \u201c[My] first cinema experience [which] possibly traumatised mum more than me. It\u2019s an animation classic, a creation myth for rabbits, and, like the most popular fairy tales, kids can actually cope with the horror and being a bit scared.\u201d Annabel Houghton, south-west London Jason and the Argonauts (1963) The legendary quest for the golden fleece, with pioneering stop-motion animation from Ray Harryhausen \u201cI remember my grandparents showing me it in the early 90s, about 30 years after it had been released, and thinking it was the best thing ever. The special effects seemed like the most modern and advanced stuff possible, even though it was made in 1963.\u201d BigCherryDingDong The Iron Giant (1999) A giant robot falls from outer space and befriends a young boy in this adaptation of a Ted Hughes story \u201cI agree strongly [with the many other commenters who recommended it]. Fantastic film.\u201d Dingfelder The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992) Uproarious take on the Yuletide classic, with Kermit as Bob Cratchit, Gonzo as Charles Dickens and Michael Caine as Scrooge \u201cThe finest adaptation of Mr Dickens\u2019s tale in existence.\u201d Gordon, Manchester Spirited Away (2001) Highly imaginative Studio Ghibli animation featuring a lost girl, pigs, witches and a vomiting spirit \u201cHowever old you are I urge you to watch this film and I guarantee you will take something from it.\u201d Harry Dibbs Life Is Beautiful (1997) Roberto Benigni shields his son from the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp in this Oscar-winning comedy\u2011drama \u201cWould Life Is Beautiful be suitable for older kids? If so, it should definitely be on this list. An absolute masterpiece.\u201d Matthew James, Barcelona Fantastic Planet (1973) French-Czech animation about a human uprising against alien overlords on a faraway planet \u201cI saw it in the cinema when it first came out. It blew my young mind and still resonates after all of these years.\u201d JSpicoli, North Wales The Black Stallion (1979) A boy is shipwrecked with an Arabian horse in an American adaptation of the 1941 Walter Farley children\u2019s classic \u201cIt\u2019s a superb mysterious story, almost wordless for much of its time. It\u2019s one of these rare films that doesn\u2019t talk down to children but invites you into its mysterious and complete world. I think it works equally well for adults too.\u201d Ewan Small, Giffnock, Glasgow Mouse Hunt (1997) Two brothers inheriting a dilapidated mansion are foiled by a diminutive foe in this fast-paced slapstick comedy \u201cOne film for the whole family, even the much older kids among you, which I can\u2019t recommend highly enough. It features quite possibly the single most charismatic titular lead of any film.\u201d asemblanceofchaos Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) Cartoon characters and live-action humans coexist unharmoniously in Robert Zemeckis\u2019s comedy starring Bob Hoskins as a toon-hating detective \u201cMy favourite film as a kid (I still remember all of the words).

In spite of the subject matter there is something life-affirming about the film (and the book) that left a lasting impression on me.\u201d Nigel Jones, Ealing, London Melody (1971) Teen romance (originally marketed as SWALK in the UK) with a screenplay by Alan Parker \u201cA beautiful, sweet and poignant film from the early 70s about two kids who fall in love and want to get married.

      "body": "<p>The timing could not be better. On 1 September 1939, German troops crossed the border into Poland, triggering the start of the second world war. Eighty years to the day later, on 1 September 2019, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/02/trumps-300bn-china-tariff-threat-sends-markets-into-tailspin\" title=\"\">plans to impose a 10% tariff</a> on a fresh range of Chinese imports into the US.

Up until now, the Chinese goods targeted for tariffs have been carefully selected to avoid hurting consumers. That is no longer the case.

The taxes will be paid by Americans faced with paying more for imports.</p> <p>With less than 18 months to go before the culmination of the 2020 presidential election race, this is a strategy fraught with risk. Trump is gambling that China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, will bow to the pressure and sign a comprehensive trade deal that would provide greater market access for American companies, increase imports of US agricultural products and act to prevent the theft of American intellectual property.</p> <p>The US president is also using the threat of a full-blown protectionist standoff between the world\u2019s two biggest economies to bully the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, into further cuts in interest rates.

      "bodyText": "The timing could not be better. On 1 September 1939, German troops crossed the border into Poland, triggering the start of the second world war. Eighty years to the day later, on 1 September 2019, Donald Trump plans to impose a 10% tariff on a fresh range of Chinese imports into the US. If that happens, it will mark the moment when trade\u2019s cold war turns hot. Make no mistake, the unexpected announcement threatens to have serious consequences. Up until now, the Chinese goods targeted for tariffs have been carefully selected to avoid hurting consumers. That is no longer the case. From next month, almost everything China sends to the US will be affected. In bald terms, that means Americans are going to be paying more for their smartphones, laptops and clothes. Trump boasts that the US is going to be \u201ctaxing the hell out of China\u201d but he has got the economics completely wrong. The taxes will be paid by Americans faced with paying more for imports. With less than 18 months to go before the culmination of the 2020 presidential election race, this is a strategy fraught with risk. Trump is gambling that China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, will bow to the pressure and sign a comprehensive trade deal that would provide greater market access for American companies, increase imports of US agricultural products and act to prevent the theft of American intellectual property. The US president is also using the threat of a full-blown protectionist standoff between the world\u2019s two biggest economies to bully the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, into further cuts in interest rates. Global tensions were top of the Fed\u2019s list of concerns when it announced a quarter-point cut in official borrowing costs last week. Those tensions have just got a whole lot worse. Trump also thinks that he will be able to squeeze more trade concessions out of the European Union if he can bring China to heel. Germany \u2013 particularly its car industry \u2013 has been served notice by the president that it is next. But the strategy relies on Beijing buckling, something that it has yet to do. China\u2019s initial response to Trump\u2019s announcement \u2013 that this is not the way to negotiate \u2013 signals that Xi is prepared to play the long game. To be sure, tariffs are hurting the Chinese economy, which is growing at its slowest pace since the early 1990s. But China is still expanding by just over 6% a year, three times as fast as the US. What\u2019s more, global financial markets were caught completely unawares by Trump\u2019s latest salvo and there was a predictable response to his tweets: tumbling share prices, cheaper oil and a flight into safe havens such as gold. Xi thinks that turmoil on Wall Street is not necessarily what the president wants in the coming months. China is also waiting to see whether someone with less protectionist instincts wins the race for the White House next year, and whether Republicans shaping up for tight congressional races in 2020 will start putting pressure on Trump to be conciliatory if the US economy starts to slow under the weight of the trade war. But China will do more than sit back and wait for Trump to reconsider. It has weapons of its own and will announce retaliation: by banning certain US companies from doing business, by limiting the exports of rare earth materials that are crucial for hi-tech US companies, and by raising tariffs on American goods.

Conciliation talks are continuing, but pilots will know that they are up against a battle-hardened opponent. Vegan success shows Greggs can roll with a changing market The vegan sausage roll has acted as rocket booster for Greggs, helping propel it towards a very modern form of retail success as it reaches new customers. The news that the Newcastle-based company now sells more takeaway coffee in the UK than Starbucks, while only Tesco sells more sandwiches and McDonald\u2019s more breakfasts, is astounding. Hold the McMuffin. Shareholders are getting a Quorn-and-pastry-funded \u00a335m special dividend, after sales at established stores leapt 10.5% and profits jumped more than 50% to \u00a340.6m in the six months to 29 June.

This is an island that seems to love both the unexpected and the extreme.</p> <p>Kalymnos was once the sponge-diving capital of the Mediterranean, but by the mid-1980s, a marine virus had destroyed that business. (The interesting nautical museum in the capital, Pothia, is filled with superb period photographs and artefacts.) Meanwhile, the nearby island of Kos had become a tourist honeypot, whose boat owners reportedly told visitors not to bother with Kalymnos because \u201cit\u2019s just rocks\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe25eedba202e371f4f55795b1edf1ced1b081d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe25eedba202e371f4f55795b1edf1ced1b081d1/0_109_4014_2409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maddy climbing up to the cave from the kayaks near Vathys on Kalymnos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Rushby\u2019s daughter Maddy climbing up to a cave at from the kayaks near Vathys</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That didn\u2019t deter Andrea Di Bari, an Italian climber who wanted rocks, big ones. He came over in the mid-1990s on a day trip, spotted the potential, and returned. By the early noughties, rock climbing had transformed the island\u2019s reputation. I\u2019ve come to test out this island of adventure.</p> <p>I\u2019m joined by my partner Sophie and daughter Maddy (16) who have come over on the ferry from Kos for a few days. We stay in the climbing capital, Massouri, in a cool and lovely apartment overlooking Telendos, a car-free island that I\u2019m itching to explore. But we start by meeting Dimitris, a dive master who sails us east around the island. Dimitris comes from a long line of sponge divers, and points out the spot where, 50 years ago, his grandfather died while using a newfangled brass helmet and compressor. No one had told the divers about the dangers and complexities of using air underwater.</p> <p>Today we are searching for dolphins and Dimitris assures us that his family connections will guarantee an encounter. Stopping above his father-in-law\u2019s fish farm, he dives to 20 metres and releases a shoal of sea bass. I\u2019m snorkelling above and see them come up, rolling their silvery sides enticingly, but there are no dolphins. The sea bass, sensing an opportunity, race away to freedom. Yesterday\u2019s stormy winds, Dimitris thinks, have unfortunately pushed the dolphins out of their usual haunts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d7fe418aa45ec8b4deea2aa9ddf7f9d6f47cd92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d7fe418aa45ec8b4deea2aa9ddf7f9d6f47cd92/0_262_3260_1956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kalymnos, Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An octopus gets up close</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We climb back into the boat and head into a narrow inlet where cliffs up to 15 metres high have become a popular spot for deep-water soloing. This involves diving into the sea, then grabbing the rock and attempting to climb to the cliff-top. A pair of old climbing shoes can be handy. Maddy skips the climbing element, walks up and chucks herself off the top. I fall. Deep water soloing is, I predict, a sport of the future, especially when the water is this warm.</p> <p>We sail on round the east coast to the lovely village of Vathys, where we say goodbye to Dimitris and jump into kayaks with a new guide, Tasos. He paddles with us to another, much higher, cliff face and points out a cave about 50 metres up. After an ungainly transfer to land, we climb a narrow set of steps, push through a curtain of wild figs and descend into cool gloom. All sorts of ancient treasures have been found in this cave (they\u2019re now in the remarkable Archaeological Museum of Kalymnos, also in Pothia). At the bottom is a pool of clear, cold water. Potsherds (broken ceramics) lie around the feet of great limestone pillars.</p> <p>We retrace our steps and paddle out to a lovely deserted beach to picnic in the shade of a tree. Day one complete, we return to Massouri, where there are lots of excellent restaurants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8692712036bcaefd06b043f6e20fc69abe9816e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8692712036bcaefd06b043f6e20fc69abe9816e3/0_212_5254_3153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pothia scene.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m sitting on the shady patio of the Paradisio cafe in Vlychadia, overlooking an azure bay. My wet swimming kit is drying on the fence. \u201cI should explain the breakfast,\u201d says Stethis, who has been my guide on an epic morning of hiking, caving and swimming. \u201cKalymnos people like to mix unexpected tastes. That tea is alisfakia \u2013 sage \u2013 with thyme honey. And that mizithra cheese goes with the watermelon.\u201d I try it. Great combination. \u201cAnd the coffee is bitter, but you\u2019ve got this vanilla-scented sugar stick.\u201d I\u2019m starting to get the hang of Kalymnos, the second stop on my quest to explore the Aegean\u2019s lesser-known islands (which had begun in Ikaria, 2hr 40min away by ferry). This is an island that seems to love both the unexpected and the extreme. Kalymnos was once the sponge-diving capital of the Mediterranean, but by the mid-1980s, a marine virus had destroyed that business. (The interesting nautical museum in the capital, Pothia, is filled with superb period photographs and artefacts.) Meanwhile, the nearby island of Kos had become a tourist honeypot, whose boat owners reportedly told visitors not to bother with Kalymnos because \u201cit\u2019s just rocks\u201d. That didn\u2019t deter Andrea Di Bari, an Italian climber who wanted rocks, big ones. He came over in the mid-1990s on a day trip, spotted the potential, and returned. By the early noughties, rock climbing had transformed the island\u2019s reputation. I\u2019ve come to test out this island of adventure. I\u2019m joined by my partner Sophie and daughter Maddy (16) who have come over on the ferry from Kos for a few days. We stay in the climbing capital, Massouri, in a cool and lovely apartment overlooking Telendos, a car-free island that I\u2019m itching to explore. But we start by meeting Dimitris, a dive master who sails us east around the island. Dimitris comes from a long line of sponge divers, and points out the spot where, 50 years ago, his grandfather died while using a newfangled brass helmet and compressor. No one had told the divers about the dangers and complexities of using air underwater. Today we are searching for dolphins and Dimitris assures us that his family connections will guarantee an encounter. Stopping above his father-in-law\u2019s fish farm, he dives to 20 metres and releases a shoal of sea bass. I\u2019m snorkelling above and see them come up, rolling their silvery sides enticingly, but there are no dolphins. The sea bass, sensing an opportunity, race away to freedom. Yesterday\u2019s stormy winds, Dimitris thinks, have unfortunately pushed the dolphins out of their usual haunts. We climb back into the boat and head into a narrow inlet where cliffs up to 15 metres high have become a popular spot for deep-water soloing. This involves diving into the sea, then grabbing the rock and attempting to climb to the cliff-top. A pair of old climbing shoes can be handy. Maddy skips the climbing element, walks up and chucks herself off the top. I fall. Deep water soloing is, I predict, a sport of the future, especially when the water is this warm. We sail on round the east coast to the lovely village of Vathys, where we say goodbye to Dimitris and jump into kayaks with a new guide, Tasos. He paddles with us to another, much higher, cliff face and points out a cave about 50 metres up. After an ungainly transfer to land, we climb a narrow set of steps, push through a curtain of wild figs and descend into cool gloom. All sorts of ancient treasures have been found in this cave (they\u2019re now in the remarkable Archaeological Museum of Kalymnos, also in Pothia). At the bottom is a pool of clear, cold water. Potsherds (broken ceramics) lie around the feet of great limestone pillars. We retrace our steps and paddle out to a lovely deserted beach to picnic in the shade of a tree. Day one complete, we return to Massouri, where there are lots of excellent restaurants. Next morning Maddy and I are back with Dimitris for a shore dive which proves to be something of a classic: sponges, amphorae, a German second world war plane, bombs, a wrecked sponge boat, plenty of fish and an irate octopus that squirts angry ink, changes colour and escapes up a tiny rocky hole. Finally, the bit I\u2019ve been most looking forward to: the rock climbing. We are picked up by Loukas and Kostas. Is it going to be too hot? Loukas shakes his head. \u201cWe have climbing in the shade all year. May and October are best, but summer is fine.\u201d There are also so many routes that climbers can do 10 a day for a year and never repeat one. We head north to cliffs above the village of Arginonta. Kostas, Maddy and I climb. Sophie watches. There\u2019s a dog barking down in the village. \u201cThat\u2019s Vito, my dog,\u201d says Kostas. He points out his house. \u201cHe wants to play.\u201d Sophie heads off to find Vito. I manage to climb a grade harder than I\u2019ve ever done before and then we head for the beach. That\u2019s the joy of Kalymnos: hard, dry rock followed by cool wet sea. There we find Sophie in doggie heaven. Vito likes diving down, picking things off the seabed and bringing them back to be thrown. Climbing may be the new Kalymnos, but the sponge-diving heritage is still there. \u2022 The trip was provided by Sunvil which has seven nights self-catering at Eftychia Residence in Massouri from \u00a31,253pp including flights from Gatwick and transfers. The ferry from Ikaria to Kalymnos costs \u20ac32 one way, from Kos \u20ac11, book through ferries.gr. Six mornings climbing with an instructor (beginners and intermediates) cost \u20ac350pp; diving trips cost from \u20ac50pp, book at visit-kalymnos.gr Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Truss met senior representatives from the <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/\" title=\"\">Heritage Foundation</a>, a thinktank committed to shrinking the state and cutting environmental regulation, to discuss \u201cregulatory reform\u201d. Also at the meeting was the <a href=\"https://cei.org/\" title=\"\">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a>. Both groups were part of the \u201cshadow trade talks\u201d project, designed to advocate a wide-ranging US trade deal allowing the import of American goods currently banned in Britain.</p> <p>One briefing note reveals that Truss was keen to hear \u201cwhat we can learn from \u2018Reaganomics\u2019 on things like regulation and red tape\u201d. Truss also planned to tell the Heritage Foundation that she is \u201ccommitted to\u201d, and \u201cpersonally interested in\u201d, exploring similar reforms in the UK. \u201cReaganomics\u201d is shorthand for the policies of the former Republican US president Ronald Reagan, based on tax cuts and deregulation.</p> <p>Truss has made no secret of her interest in cutting the size of the state. However, she is now in charge of Britain\u2019s post-Brexit trade deals in a government committed to leaving the EU with no deal if necessary. Many fear a no-deal Brexit will pave the way for a weakening of UK food and environment protections. The US agricultural sector has insisted that any deal scraps restrictions on chlorinated chicken, hormone-treated beef, and pesticide usage currently circumscribed by the EU.</p> <p>John Sauven, Greenpeace\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThere are widespread concerns that Brexit will be used to weaken our safeguards on food safety and animal welfare, opening the floodgates to products such as chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef. These concerns will only grow at the discovery that the minister in charge of forging a trade deal with the US flew to a libertarian boot camp run by Donald Trump\u2019s buddies to be lectured about the supposed benefits of ditching regulations.</p> <p>\u201cBoris Johnson promised that a trade deal with the US would not jeopardise our food and animal welfare standards. People will be watching closely to see whether these words mean anything at all.\u201d</p> <p>Truss also met the chief economist of the <a href=\"https://www.alec.org/\" title=\"\">American Legislative Exchange Council </a>(ALEC), which involved a discussion of the success of Trump\u2019s efforts to deregulate the US economy. ALEC has lobbied against action on climate change, with companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil quitting involvement in it as a result. Another document has revealed that an official from the Foreign Office wrote to another free-market thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.rstreet.org/\" title=\"\">R Street Institute</a>, on Truss\u2019s behalf requesting a meeting to discuss \u201cbusiness deregulation\u201d.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to negotiating an ambitious free-trade agreement with the US. Without exception, imports into the UK will meet our stringent food safety and animal welfare standards. That\u2019s not going to change.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The cabinet minister in charge of negotiating a new US trade deal met with a series of rightwing American thinktanks to discuss deregulation and the benefits of \u201cReaganomics\u201d, new documents have revealed. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, had a number of meetings with libertarian groups that have championed parts of Donald Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda and tax cuts. New details of her three-day visit to Washington last September have been uncovered by Greenpeace\u2019s investigative journalism team, Unearthed. Truss met senior representatives from the Heritage Foundation, a thinktank committed to shrinking the state and cutting environmental regulation, to discuss \u201cregulatory reform\u201d. Also at the meeting was the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Both groups were part of the \u201cshadow trade talks\u201d project, designed to advocate a wide-ranging US trade deal allowing the import of American goods currently banned in Britain. One briefing note reveals that Truss was keen to hear \u201cwhat we can learn from \u2018Reaganomics\u2019 on things like regulation and red tape\u201d. Truss also planned to tell the Heritage Foundation that she is \u201ccommitted to\u201d, and \u201cpersonally interested in\u201d, exploring similar reforms in the UK. \u201cReaganomics\u201d is shorthand for the policies of the former Republican US president Ronald Reagan, based on tax cuts and deregulation. Truss has made no secret of her interest in cutting the size of the state. However, she is now in charge of Britain\u2019s post-Brexit trade deals in a government committed to leaving the EU with no deal if necessary. Many fear a no-deal Brexit will pave the way for a weakening of UK food and environment protections. The US agricultural sector has insisted that any deal scraps restrictions on chlorinated chicken, hormone-treated beef, and pesticide usage currently circumscribed by the EU. John Sauven, Greenpeace\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThere are widespread concerns that Brexit will be used to weaken our safeguards on food safety and animal welfare, opening the floodgates to products such as chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef. These concerns will only grow at the discovery that the minister in charge of forging a trade deal with the US flew to a libertarian boot camp run by Donald Trump\u2019s buddies to be lectured about the supposed benefits of ditching regulations. \u201cBoris Johnson promised that a trade deal with the US would not jeopardise our food and animal welfare standards. People will be watching closely to see whether these words mean anything at all.\u201d Truss also met the chief economist of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which involved a discussion of the success of Trump\u2019s efforts to deregulate the US economy. ALEC has lobbied against action on climate change, with companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil quitting involvement in it as a result. Another document has revealed that an official from the Foreign Office wrote to another free-market thinktank, R Street Institute, on Truss\u2019s behalf requesting a meeting to discuss \u201cbusiness deregulation\u201d. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to negotiating an ambitious free-trade agreement with the US. Without exception, imports into the UK will meet our stringent food safety and animal welfare standards. That\u2019s not going to change.\u201d",

Surveillance drones operated by Frontex, or by agencies or service providers with which Frontex co-operates, appear to be flying over waters off Libya where not a single rescue has been carried out by the main EU naval mission since last August, in what is the deadliest stretch of water in the world.</p> <p>After publication, the Frontex press office said that \u201ccurrently Frontex is not using any drones\u201d and not receiving any information from drones.</p> <p>The replacement of naval vessels, which can conduct rescues, with drones, which cannot, is being condemned as a cynical abrogation of any European role in saving lives.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no obligation for drones to be equipped with life-saving appliances and to conduct rescue operations,\u201d said a German Green party MEP, Erik Marquardt. \u201cYou need ships for that, and ships are exactly what there is a lack of at the moment.\u201d This year the death rate for people attempting the Mediterranean crossing has risen from a historical average of 2% to as high as 14% last month.

Thus the maritime rescue coordination centre in Rome has begun to share information with its Libyan counterpart in Tripoli, under the instructions of Italy\u2019s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini.</p> <p>The EU is already accused of crimes against humanity in a submission before the International Criminal Court for \u201corchestrating a policy of forced transfer to concentration camp-like detention facilities [in Libya] where atrocious crimes are committed\u201d.</p> <p>The case, brought by lawyers based in Paris, seeks to demonstrate that many of the people intercepted have faced human rights abuses ranging from slavery to torture and murder after being returned to Libya.</p> <p>Omer Shatz, an Israeli who teaches at Sciences Po university in Paris, and one of the two lawyers who brought the ICC case, said Frontex drone operators could be criminally liable for aiding pullbacks. \u201cA drone operator that is aware of a migrant boat in distress is obliged to secure fundamental rights to life, body integrity, liberty and dignity. This means she has to take actions intended to search, rescue and disembark those rescued at safe port. Acting to extradite helpless vulnerable civilians to the hands of Libyan militias may amount to criminal liability.\u201d</p> <p>After publication, Frontex disputed this view, saying: \u201cIt is never a drone operator or a pilot assessing whether a vessel is in distress and where it should be disembarked. In the case of the two planes used by Frontex to monitor the Central Mediterranean, the video is live-streamed to the agency\u2019s headquarters, where a group of experts, including maritime surveillance experts, analyse the image and make an initial assessment whether a case can be qualified as SAR based on certain parameters (number of people on board, condition on boat, distance from shore, presence of life vests, weather conditions). This initial assessment is communicated to the maritime search and rescue center (MRCC) for further action.\u201d</p> <p>Under international law, migrants rescued at sea by European vessels cannot be returned to Libya, where conflict and human rights abuses mean the UN has stated there is no safe port. Under the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) all ships are obliged to report an encounter with a vessel in distress and offer assistance. This is partly why EU naval missions that were not mandated to conduct rescue missions found themselves pitched into them regardless.</p> <p>Drones, however, operate in a legal grey zone not covered by Unclos. The situation for private contractors to EU agencies, as in some of the current drone operations, is even less clear.</p> <p>Frontex told the <em>Observer</em> that all drone operators, staff or private contractors are subject to EU laws that mandate the protection of human life. The agency said it was unable to share a copy of the mission instructions given to drone operators that would tell them what to do in the event of encountering a boat in distress, asking the <em>Observer</em> to submit a freedom of information request. The agency said drones had encountered boats in distress on only four occasions \u2013 all in June this year \u2013 in the central Mediterranean, and that none had led to a \u201cserious incident report\u201d \u2013 Frontex jargon for a red flag. When EU naval vessels were deployed in similar areas in previous years, multiple serious incidents were reported every month, according to documents seen by the Observer.</p> <p><em>Reporting for this </em><em>article was supported by the Returns Network, an investigative unit collaborating with ARD Report M\u00fcnchen, De Correspondent, EfSyn and the Observer</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 August and 14 August 2019 to: clarify that Frontex is part of a \u00a395m investment by the EU in unmanned aerial vehicles; make explicit the fact that the opening paragraph describes a hypothetical not an actual situation; distinguish Frontex drones and drones operated by others; and add responses from Frontex received after initial publication of this article.</p>",

Acting to extradite helpless vulnerable civilians to the hands of Libyan militias may amount to criminal liability.\u201d After publication, Frontex disputed this view, saying: \u201cIt is never a drone operator or a pilot assessing whether a vessel is in distress and where it should be disembarked. In the case of the two planes used by Frontex to monitor the Central Mediterranean, the video is live-streamed to the agency\u2019s headquarters, where a group of experts, including maritime surveillance experts, analyse the image and make an initial assessment whether a case can be qualified as SAR based on certain parameters (number of people on board, condition on boat, distance from shore, presence of life vests, weather conditions). This initial assessment is communicated to the maritime search and rescue center (MRCC) for further action.\u201d Under international law, migrants rescued at sea by European vessels cannot be returned to Libya, where conflict and human rights abuses mean the UN has stated there is no safe port. Under the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) all ships are obliged to report an encounter with a vessel in distress and offer assistance. This is partly why EU naval missions that were not mandated to conduct rescue missions found themselves pitched into them regardless. Drones, however, operate in a legal grey zone not covered by Unclos. The situation for private contractors to EU agencies, as in some of the current drone operations, is even less clear. Frontex told the Observer that all drone operators, staff or private contractors are subject to EU laws that mandate the protection of human life. The agency said it was unable to share a copy of the mission instructions given to drone operators that would tell them what to do in the event of encountering a boat in distress, asking the Observer to submit a freedom of information request. The agency said drones had encountered boats in distress on only four occasions \u2013 all in June this year \u2013 in the central Mediterranean, and that none had led to a \u201cserious incident report\u201d \u2013 Frontex jargon for a red flag. When EU naval vessels were deployed in similar areas in previous years, multiple serious incidents were reported every month, according to documents seen by the Observer. Reporting for this article was supported by the Returns Network, an investigative unit collaborating with ARD Report M\u00fcnchen, De Correspondent, EfSyn and the Observer \u2022 This article was amended on 4 August and 14 August 2019 to: clarify that Frontex is part of a \u00a395m investment by the EU in unmanned aerial vehicles; make explicit the fact that the opening paragraph describes a hypothetical not an actual situation; distinguish Frontex drones and drones operated by others; and add responses from Frontex received after initial publication of this article.",

With operations in nine EU countries, the aerospace company\u2019s business is highly integrated with the single market.

Then again, with the government filled with Brexit hardliners, he may see no point in making himself unpopular with the new regime.</p> <p>East, who has run Rolls-Royce for four years, has got plenty of other things to keep him busy as he seeks to restore the company\u2019s place as the standard bearer for UK engineering.

      "bodyText": "Concern about the effects of a no-deal Brexit on the economy is increasing. The pound fell again last week, the Bank of England warned about the threat of recession, and manufacturing activity contracted for the third month running. Rolls-Royce, which reports first-half results on Tuesday, is bound to face questions about how it will fare if Britain dumps itself out of the EU on 31 October. With operations in nine EU countries, the aerospace company\u2019s business is highly integrated with the single market. It makes engines for Airbus\u2019s planes, produced in Toulouse, and has a factory in Dahlewitz, near Berlin, that employs about 10,000 people. Rolls-Royce has some advantages over other manufacturers under a no-deal Brexit. First, the aerospace industry already operates under World Trade Organisation rules, so there will be no extra tariffs. Second, it works at a steadier pace than the car industry and doesn\u2019t rely on just-in-time deliveries of parts hurtling back and forth across the Channel. But Rolls-Royce has warned that Brexit could upset its supply chain and constrain it from hiring the best-qualified people. It has spent up to \u00a3100m stockpiling parts at its main Derby plant and at Dahlewitz to minimise disruption. It has also discussed using Airbus\u2019s giant Beluga transporter planes to deliver engines made in Derby to France and Germany. Those plans, however thorough, still rely on the companies in Rolls-Royce\u2019s supply chain getting their parts delivered smoothly. Rolls-Royce\u2019s boss, Warren East, supported staying in the EU at the 2016 referendum and urged MPs to vote for Theresa May\u2019s agreement before the now-abandoned March deadline. More recently, East has been less vocal, describing Brexit as a hassle that had to be dealt with. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to spend as much preparing for some deadline that might never happen,\u201d he said in June. \u201cIt\u2019s just an unnecessary distraction for businesses.\u201d Like many people, East may simply be fed up with discussing Brexit. Then again, with the government filled with Brexit hardliners, he may see no point in making himself unpopular with the new regime. East, who has run Rolls-Royce for four years, has got plenty of other things to keep him busy as he seeks to restore the company\u2019s place as the standard bearer for UK engineering. A series of profit warnings and a Serious Fraud Office investigation, now resolved, had damaged Rolls-Royce\u2019s reputation. East found a lumbering bureaucracy unable to respond quickly enough to changes in the industry. He chopped 600 senior manager posts and is in the middle of cutting another 4,600 jobs from the company\u2019s workforce of about 50,000. Rolls-Royce has had to set aside \u00a31.5bn to fix faults with its Trent 1000 engines, whose turbine blades were wearing out too quickly, grounding customers\u2019 planes. East has said Trent 1000 orders are on the increase after a grim patch last year. David Perry, an analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove, argues there are problems ahead because the company has underestimated the cost of developing electric engines in response to pressure on the industry over emissions. Last year, Rolls-Royce swung to an \u00a3803m loss, excluding financing costs, from a \u00a31.2bn profit the year before, as it spent \u00a3790m fixing the Trent 1000\u2019s faults. For the first half of 2019 analysts expect the underlying pre-tax profit, which excludes Trent 1000 costs and other one-offs, to rise to \u00a395m from \u00a381m.",

      "bodyText": "Anthony Albanese has rejected an allegation from the Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie that there is corruption in federal politics. \u201cI have not seen any evidence of direct corruption \u2026 that has been proven in my time when I\u2019ve been in parliament,\u201d he said on Sunday. Speaking on the ABC, the Labor leader was defending the opposition\u2019s decision this past week not to support a crossbench proposal for a parliamentary committee to examine new allegations involving Crown casino. Nine Entertainment reported last weekend that Crown had \u2013 when trying to attract Chinese high-rollers to its Melbourne gaming rooms \u2013 partnered with people linked to organised crime and encouraged staff based in mainland China to stretch strict laws against promoting gambling, which led to 19 Crown staff members being arrested in China in 2016. A couple of days after the allegations were published, Wilkie ventilated under parliamentary privilege further allegations from a former Crown driver turned whistleblower. The extraordinary allegations included claims he transported foreign nationals to the company\u2019s Melbourne hotel from a private jet base without being subjected to border security checks and saw women degraded, abused and \u201cslapped around\u201d. Albanese said the crossbench move for a parliamentary inquiry into the controversy was suboptimal because it would lack powers of coercion. He argued Wilkie\u2019s proposal was not serious: \u201cThe crossbenchers who moved it didn\u2019t bother to even ring us beforehand to inform us that they were moving that resolution on the floor. \u201cI say to Mr Wilkie, if he\u2019s serious about moving a resolution in the parliament \u2013 I talk to him all the time, I have a good relationship with him \u2013 he should consult, if \u2026 he wants to get support for resolutions.\u201d Labor had supported a separate proposal from the Morrison government for the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to examine the allegations aired by Nine. \u201cIt\u2019s a body that looks after these issues, that does have coercive powers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t conduct serious investigations with a parliamentary committee. What you need is a body that has the same powers of a royal commission, which this body has.\u201d When it was pointed out the ACLEI inquiry would not be able to examine the conduct of MPs, Albanese insisted any errant MPs would be drawn into the probe if there was any wrongdoing. When parliament returns after the winter recess, the Greens will attempt to bring on debate in the Senate about a national integrity commission bill with more broadranging powers than the model being pursued by the Morrison government. Albanese said on Sunday the government needed to get on with establishing its national integrity commission. While he had not witnessed any corruption that had been proven during his career as a federal parliamentarian \u201cone of the reasons why we need a national integrity commission is to ensure that the public can have confidence in that\u201d.",

It\u2019s a tidy fit because this would be exactly the kind of place Bridget would want to visit to eat away the pain of a calamitous break-up. In particular, she should order the fries with mussel and bacon chowder, because they will make everything better. I say \u201cwith\u201d the chowder, because that\u2019s how the menu describes it; \u201csubmerged in\u201d is closer to the mark.</p> <p>Behold: a deep, soothing bowl of a wine and cream-based chowder, bobbing with Ford Cortina-orange mussels, into which has been dumped a whole serving of rather good chips. Pile a few more pert mussels on top, along with a bacon crumb and finely diced green herbs and spring onions to make it look like all the vital food groups have been covered, and there you have it: solace in a bowl. It\u2019s a pescatarian take on Lancashire\u2019s classic chips and gravy. The ones on the top are crisp; the ones beneath are a yielding soggy mess of cream and seafood and potato and profundity. Lean over and shovel it in, until your cheeks are slicked with soup and the bad thoughts have gone away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f73ffb205e9c8e18371f1ae64e8f6d83bc7b3d31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f73ffb205e9c8e18371f1ae64e8f6d83bc7b3d31/0_305_5462_3278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Solace in a bowl\u2019: fries with mussels and bacon chowder.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Solace in a bowl\u2019: fries with mussels and bacon chowder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s an outrageous and joyous menu item \u2013 the word \u201cdish\u201d might be pushing it \u2013 which sums up the full-frontal assault of the food here. The cooking laughs in the face of the mostly American dishes it names on the menu. The succotash isn\u2019t quite a succotash; the shrimp and grits would make a native of the state of Georgia frown. None of that matters, because most of it is very good. It\u2019s called Bob\u2019s Lobster because it grew out of the initials of Bedales of Borough, the wine bar back near the market (which, as it happens, occupies the site of what was the Greek restaurant in the original Bridget Jones movie). It helps that the founder is called Roberto Dann; there\u2019s a bona fide Bob involved.</p> <p>Dann was looking to diversify from their wine and small plates offering, so he imported a vintage red-and-white VW camper van and started flogging lobster rolls out of it at Borough Market.

      "bodyText": "Bob\u2019s Lobster, Unit 71, St Thomas Street, London SE1 3QX (020 7407 7099). Snacks and small plates \u00a33.50-\u00a311; large plates \u00a312-\u00a322; seafood tower \u00a340; desserts \u00a36; wines from \u00a325 In the movies that carry her name, the fictional Bridget Jones lives a short, tear-stained, snot-smeared stumble from the real location of Bob\u2019s Lobster, tucked into one of the spaces beneath the newly renovated London Bridge station. It\u2019s a tidy fit because this would be exactly the kind of place Bridget would want to visit to eat away the pain of a calamitous break-up. In particular, she should order the fries with mussel and bacon chowder, because they will make everything better. I say \u201cwith\u201d the chowder, because that\u2019s how the menu describes it; \u201csubmerged in\u201d is closer to the mark. Behold: a deep, soothing bowl of a wine and cream-based chowder, bobbing with Ford Cortina-orange mussels, into which has been dumped a whole serving of rather good chips. Pile a few more pert mussels on top, along with a bacon crumb and finely diced green herbs and spring onions to make it look like all the vital food groups have been covered, and there you have it: solace in a bowl. It\u2019s a pescatarian take on Lancashire\u2019s classic chips and gravy. The ones on the top are crisp; the ones beneath are a yielding soggy mess of cream and seafood and potato and profundity. Lean over and shovel it in, until your cheeks are slicked with soup and the bad thoughts have gone away. It\u2019s an outrageous and joyous menu item \u2013 the word \u201cdish\u201d might be pushing it \u2013 which sums up the full-frontal assault of the food here. The cooking laughs in the face of the mostly American dishes it names on the menu. The succotash isn\u2019t quite a succotash; the shrimp and grits would make a native of the state of Georgia frown. None of that matters, because most of it is very good. It\u2019s called Bob\u2019s Lobster because it grew out of the initials of Bedales of Borough, the wine bar back near the market (which, as it happens, occupies the site of what was the Greek restaurant in the original Bridget Jones movie). It helps that the founder is called Roberto Dann; there\u2019s a bona fide Bob involved. Dann was looking to diversify from their wine and small plates offering, so he imported a vintage red-and-white VW camper van and started flogging lobster rolls out of it at Borough Market. The polished camper van now sits in the high-ceilinged space they\u2019ve taken over in the red-brick undercarriage of London Bridge station. It\u2019s just opposite the Vinegar Yard street food market that opened a couple of months ago. What was, until very recently, a deserted and scuffed Bermondsey drag is now, on a warm Thursday evening, full of bustle and shout and the merry clink of glass on glass. Here at Bob\u2019s there\u2019s a bar knocking out foaming pisco sours. They have an oyster happy hour late every Monday to Friday afternoon with bivalves at a quid each.

For an extra \u00a320 they\u2019ll chuck the lobster tail on, too. We start with tuna tacos, which arrive tucked into a deep groove chiselled down a polished plank of wood, so it looks like a taco luge. It\u2019s a significant amount of engineering to keep these elegant pockets of sashimi-grade tuna, wasabi-boosted guacamole, chipotle-flavoured cream and deep-fried wonton shells fully contained. There are four of them for \u00a39. Each one is three or four satisfying mouthfuls of quality raw fish, acidity, crunch and spice. Unlike the chowder-splashed fries, eating these feels like an act of virtue. As does the succotash, which should probably come inside inverted commas. It keeps to the essentials, being a mixture of sweetcorn and podded broad beans. The addition of courgettes, fresh mint and, in particular, crumbled feta, leads it off towards the southern Mediterranean rather than the southern US.

Maybe I should rephrase that: almost all of my go-to white grapes \u2013 from riesling to chenin blanc and cool-climate chardonnay \u2013 derive most of their pleasure from that electric, mouthwatering quality that makes drinking them so compulsive. That\u2019s certainly the case with a variety that has been building a following in the UK recently, and that is now available in most wine merchants (including supermarkets) and broad-minded restaurants: Hungarian furmint. It\u2019s long been known as the base of the country\u2019s great sweet wine, Tokaji. But it\u2019s in its incarnation as a dry white that it\u2019s making waves right now, with Sainsbury\u2019s TTD version a tongue-tingling mouthful of Cox\u2019s apple.</p> <p><strong>Kardos Furmint, Hungary 2017 (\u00a310.95, Kwoff, Noel Young Wines)</strong><br>The Royal Tokaji company, the people behind Sainsbury\u2019s furmint, were important players in the rejuvenation of the Tokaj region in the immediate post-Soviet years. If you like the TTD, the company\u2019s own dry wines are worth pursuing next. Royal Tokaji Company M\u00e9zes M\u00e1ly Furmint Dry Tokaj 2016 (\u00a317.99, Ministry of Drinks) pulls off the furmint trick of combining resonant fruit richness, a waxiness of texture and delicate floral notes. There\u2019s a similar ripe tanginess combined with the steely swish of acidity and minerals in Hetszolo Tokaji Dry Furmint 2016 (\u00a317, The Good Wine Shop). Both are brilliant white-meat matches, while Kardos\u2019s number comes in a racy, citrussy style (think riesling to the Royal Tokaji company and Hetszolo\u2019s chenin blanc) bound for fish.</p> <p><strong>Kolonics Somloi Furmint, Hungary 2017 (\u00a313.50, The Wine Society)<br></strong>Hungarian Furmint isn\u2019t only found in Tokaj. On the other side of the country, the hill of Soml\u00f3 is sometimes described as Hungary\u2019s answer to Burgundy\u2019s famous hill of Corton. In quality the dry whites have the potential to match up to the classic French region\u2019s dry chardonnay whites, albeit with a different range of flavours. I was impressed by the lively, fragrant Tornai Furmint F 2016 (from \u00a312, forestwines.com), which has a brisk peachiness not unlike viognier or albari\u00f1o. And I love the richness of Kolonics Furmint. And just because it\u2019s summer and dry wines are on our minds, we shouldn\u2019t forget the original furmint favourite back in Tokaj: the electric sweet Dereszla Tokaji Aszu 5 Puttonyos 2013 (\u00a327.99, 50cl, <a href=\"https://www.virginwines.co.uk/\">virginwines.co.uk</a>) is a year-round blue cheese partner par excellence.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p> <p><br></p>",

The ride-hailing service wants to ferry the world around in self-driving cars and on electric scooters, deliver our takeouts and groceries by drone, and ship freight via robot trucks. But first Uber needs to answer a big question: will it ever make any money? This week, Wall Street will have the chance to ask that question. Uber went public in May in one of the most anticipated initial public offerings in years. To say it stalled would be an understatement. Shares were sold at a cut price of $45 each, and fell on their first day of trading, costing early investors $618m \u2013 the biggest first-day IPO loss since 1975.

      "body": "<p>Much has been made in recent days of the supposed similarities between Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. On a personal level, it is said, both men are boastful braggarts, frequently untruthful and skilled at self-promotion, which is pretty much all they care about. In terms of policy, both are rightwing populists wedded to a recklessly destructive form of regressive, pseudo-nostalgic nationalism.</p> <p>Both Johnson and Trump inspire strong feelings, especially in their detractors. Max Hastings, who was Johnson\u2019s boss at the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, recently described him as a weak, cowardly character more akin to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/alan-partridge\" title=\"\">Alan Partridge</a> than to his hero, Winston Churchill. \u201cAlmost the only people who think Johnson a nice guy are those who do not know him,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-prime-minister-tory-party-britain\" title=\"\">Hastings wrote</a>.</p> <p>Trump fares even worse. The usually unemotional US columnist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/opinion/trump-2020.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Thomas Friedman</a> called him a \u201cracist, divisive, climate-change-denying, woman-abusing jerk\u201d. After Trump belittled a local black congressman, Elijah Cummings, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/baltimore-sun-editorial-trump\" title=\"\"><em>Baltimore Sun</em></a> denounced him as \u201cthe most dishonest man to ever occupy the Oval Office\u201d.</p> <p>Much less has been said about the similarities between the choices and dilemmas facing those at the opposing, liberal-progressive end of the political spectrum in the US and Britain. In both countries, the left, broadly defined, faces an all but existential challenge. The most pressing issue for Democrats as next year\u2019s election approaches is how to beat Trump. In Britain, the pre-eminent question is how to halt Brexit.</p> <p>Most liberal-progressive politicians and supporters on either side of the Atlantic understand that unless and until Trump is defeated, and Brexit stopped, their respective countries cannot move forward. Recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/01/democratic-debates-2019-detroit-joe-biden-trump\" title=\"\">debates</a> between candidates for the Democratic nomination, for example, were dominated by the spectre of a Trump second term. More than any policy issue, what matters most is identifying the person who can defeat him.</p> <p>It\u2019s early days, but <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\" title=\"\">polls suggest</a> Joe Biden, Barack Obama\u2019s former vice-president, is clear favourite. Despite unconvincing debate performances and doubts about his age (he is 76), Biden is touted as the sort of reassuring, experienced, moderate pragmatist who could attract middle America\u2019s pivotal swing voters.</p> <p>Yet that way of thinking is fiercely resisted on the party\u2019s left, where a <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\" title=\"\">younger, energised generation of reformers</a>, some from minority and multicultural backgrounds, is championing a more radical agenda on touchstone issues such as universal healthcare and migration. Insurgent candidates such as Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke are jostling the more experienced Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. All want to break the mould, not repair it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d289db81ab7a5bd7f2916ee8321c49964dcc696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d289db81ab7a5bd7f2916ee8321c49964dcc696/320_99_3365_2019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden watches as Kamala Harris speaks during a Democratic primary debate on 31 July 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden watches as Kamala Harris speaks during a Democratic primary debate on 31 July 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a possible general election nears, Britain\u2019s unambiguously anti-Brexit parties \u2013 and Labour \u2013 face similar dilemmas. If stopping Johnson\u2019s slide into no-deal catastrophe means forming nationwide electoral pacts, a successful tactic for the Liberal Democrats in last Thursday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/brecon-radnorshire-byelection-lib-dems-jane-dodds-win-cuts-johnson-commons-majority-to-one\" title=\"\">Brecon and Radnorshire byelection</a>, then must such temporary compromises be accepted for the greater good? Or is it better to maintain ideological purity and a distinct policy platform, as some in Labour may prefer, thereby increasing the Brexit risk?</p> <p>Trump is doubtless hoping Democrats pick a left-leaning candidate he can marginalise as a \u201csocialist\u201d (for Republicans, that\u2019s a dirty word) hostile to American values. He has already begun, aiming his racist, misogynistic venom at the so-called \u201csquad\u201d \u2013 four reformist congresswomen of colour whom he told to \u201cgo back\u201d where they came from. His attack on Cummings in Baltimore was another ugly signal to white America.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s attempt to brand as unpatriotic extremists those progressives who seek to create a fairer, inclusive and more equal society is a familiar one in Britain. Johnson, trapped by his own hardline Brexit rhetoric and hounded from the right by Nigel Farage, is not above adopting a version of Trump\u2019s divisive politics of identity and grievance if he thinks it will help him survive.</p> <p>How does the liberal-progressive left respond to the menace of immoral, unscrupulous rightwing populism, personified by Trump and the Johnson cabinet? How to neutralise this poison seeping through our societies? The answer cannot be a panicky, Biden-like scramble to the fabled centre-ground if that means abandoning the reform agenda. But nor is it a resort to populism of the left.</p> <p>The results of last May\u2019s local elections and the European parliamentary elections clearly showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/five-things-we-have-learned-from-the-election-results-across-europe\" title=\"\">voters are fed up with party politics as usual</a>. They want honest, practical leaders ready to shake things up and address vital issues of income inequality, healthcare, education, infrastructure and the climate crisis. Old tribal loyalties are dissolving. Radical new non-partisan thinking is required.</p> <p>Rightwing populism in Britain and the US threatens lives and livelihoods; elsewhere, it can threaten the very idea of democracy. To defeat it, and resist the global rise of authoritarianism, liberals and progressives of all stripes must join forces around a programme of reform. In Britain, that means considering parliamentary and electoral coalitions of the willing, focused in the first instance on dispelling the Brexit nightmare.</p>",

Much less has been said about the similarities between the choices and dilemmas facing those at the opposing, liberal-progressive end of the political spectrum in the US and Britain. In both countries, the left, broadly defined, faces an all but existential challenge. The most pressing issue for Democrats as next year\u2019s election approaches is how to beat Trump. In Britain, the pre-eminent question is how to halt Brexit. Most liberal-progressive politicians and supporters on either side of the Atlantic understand that unless and until Trump is defeated, and Brexit stopped, their respective countries cannot move forward. Recent debates between candidates for the Democratic nomination, for example, were dominated by the spectre of a Trump second term. More than any policy issue, what matters most is identifying the person who can defeat him. It\u2019s early days, but polls suggest Joe Biden, Barack Obama\u2019s former vice-president, is clear favourite. Despite unconvincing debate performances and doubts about his age (he is 76), Biden is touted as the sort of reassuring, experienced, moderate pragmatist who could attract middle America\u2019s pivotal swing voters. Yet that way of thinking is fiercely resisted on the party\u2019s left, where a younger, energised generation of reformers, some from minority and multicultural backgrounds, is championing a more radical agenda on touchstone issues such as universal healthcare and migration. Insurgent candidates such as Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke are jostling the more experienced Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. All want to break the mould, not repair it. As a possible general election nears, Britain\u2019s unambiguously anti-Brexit parties \u2013 and Labour \u2013 face similar dilemmas. If stopping Johnson\u2019s slide into no-deal catastrophe means forming nationwide electoral pacts, a successful tactic for the Liberal Democrats in last Thursday\u2019s Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, then must such temporary compromises be accepted for the greater good? Or is it better to maintain ideological purity and a distinct policy platform, as some in Labour may prefer, thereby increasing the Brexit risk? Trump is doubtless hoping Democrats pick a left-leaning candidate he can marginalise as a \u201csocialist\u201d (for Republicans, that\u2019s a dirty word) hostile to American values. He has already begun, aiming his racist, misogynistic venom at the so-called \u201csquad\u201d \u2013 four reformist congresswomen of colour whom he told to \u201cgo back\u201d where they came from. His attack on Cummings in Baltimore was another ugly signal to white America. Trump\u2019s attempt to brand as unpatriotic extremists those progressives who seek to create a fairer, inclusive and more equal society is a familiar one in Britain. Johnson, trapped by his own hardline Brexit rhetoric and hounded from the right by Nigel Farage, is not above adopting a version of Trump\u2019s divisive politics of identity and grievance if he thinks it will help him survive. How does the liberal-progressive left respond to the menace of immoral, unscrupulous rightwing populism, personified by Trump and the Johnson cabinet? How to neutralise this poison seeping through our societies? The answer cannot be a panicky, Biden-like scramble to the fabled centre-ground if that means abandoning the reform agenda. But nor is it a resort to populism of the left. The results of last May\u2019s local elections and the European parliamentary elections clearly showed that voters are fed up with party politics as usual. They want honest, practical leaders ready to shake things up and address vital issues of income inequality, healthcare, education, infrastructure and the climate crisis. Old tribal loyalties are dissolving. Radical new non-partisan thinking is required. Rightwing populism in Britain and the US threatens lives and livelihoods; elsewhere, it can threaten the very idea of democracy. To defeat it, and resist the global rise of authoritarianism, liberals and progressives of all stripes must join forces around a programme of reform. In Britain, that means considering parliamentary and electoral coalitions of the willing, focused in the first instance on dispelling the Brexit nightmare.",

The royal title is hugely fitting, given the hub will be the focus of the UK government\u2019s work in Scotland. The building will contain a dedicated cabinet room, the first of its kind outside of London, and I very much look forward to inviting the cabinet to meet in the building once it is open for business.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of the Scotland office has been reduced in recent years to something barely above a passport agency.

She unveiled a plaque in honour of Bessie, who played the bagpipes across Britain, campaigning for women\u2019s right to vote. Watson was, said Sturgeon, \u201ca very impressive and a very, very inspirational young woman\u201d. The first minister\u2019s tenure has been characterised by an enthusiasm for honouring little-known local heroes or attending events unannounced, where she is happy to risk her dignity singing folk songs with pick-up bands or dressing up in <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-battle-ready-brexit-18786907\" title=\"\">Viking warrior gear</a>, as she did at two recent events.</p> <p>Sturgeon and her aides are sometimes chided for over-thinking their approach to politics and civic engagement, but she gets it right more often than not. Those who encounter her in these moments simply appreciate them for what they are: a warm acknowledgment of their work and lives from the country\u2019s leader, a woman who received no favours or privileges on her own rise to the top.</p> <p>The names of many of Scotland\u2019s most recognisable landmarks that bear an incongruous royal imprint are probably too old and fondly regarded to be changed now. Not so some recent places and buildings. The Queen Elizabeth University hospital is barely four years old and its name hasn\u2019t settled into the folds of the public consciousness. You would hope that, if Scotland gains its independence, the hospitals and infirmaries bizarrely named for impervious royalty will be renamed in favour of those physicians who were born or worked in Scotland and helped advance medical science and care, such as <a href=\"https://www.scotland.org/features/the-health-of-a-nation-70-years-of-the-nhs-in-scotland\" title=\"\">Joseph Lister, Alexander Fleming and Elsie Inglis</a>.</p> <p>After a decent stretch, post-independence Scotland will surely begin to dismantle most manifestations of foolish royal fealty. A grown-up country should be sparing with its garlands and civic beatifications. Only the names of those who have earned our admiration by displaying heroic attributes in the service of others in peacetime and at war should adorn our cherished buildings and spaces.</p> <p>As for Edinburgh\u2019s brand-new government centre, I\u2019d propose Irvine Welsh, <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/scotland-poorer-place-without-indomitable-3375265\" title=\"\">Margo MacDonald</a> or <a href=\"http://www.hibshistoricaltrust.org.uk/forwards/eddie-turnbull\" title=\"\">Eddie Turnbull</a>.

Instead, we should accentuate the positive and recognise their sterling contributions in the cause of medical research: every saint has a past, every sinner has a future.</p> <p>\u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist</p>",

It will sit alongside Princes Street, named by King George III after his two sons, Prince George and Prince Frederick. Glaswegians, who seem compelled to puncture the pomposity of anything remotely stately or important, quickly renamed their new hospital \u201cthe Sweaty Betty\u201d. Perhaps the new UK hub that will become the home of an army of government drones could become Les Lizerables. It\u2019s also appropriate that one of David Mundell\u2019s last acts as secretary of state for Scotland was to issue an oleaginous eulogium for this place. \u201cI am absolutely delighted that her majesty has agreed to the naming of the new UK government hub in Edinburgh. The royal title is hugely fitting, given the hub will be the focus of the UK government\u2019s work in Scotland. The building will contain a dedicated cabinet room, the first of its kind outside of London, and I very much look forward to inviting the cabinet to meet in the building once it is open for business.\u201d The importance of the Scotland office has been reduced in recent years to something barely above a passport agency. This has been reflected in the quality of government placemen who have been told to staff it. However, Mundell contrived to leave it less important than when he\u2019d found it. He made it a footstool of Downing Street rather than an outpost of Scotland. Boris Johnson has rendered it a toy department by giving it to a comedy toff, an amusing way of humiliating Ruth Davidson for her disloyalty. What else did she and Mundell expect? When you spend years in a state of supplication to your bosses you don\u2019t earn their respect, only their contempt. Last week, Nicola Sturgeon visited the Vennel, opposite Edinburgh Castle, to pay tribute to Bessie Watson, who became the youngest ever suffragette, aged nine. She unveiled a plaque in honour of Bessie, who played the bagpipes across Britain, campaigning for women\u2019s right to vote. Watson was, said Sturgeon, \u201ca very impressive and a very, very inspirational young woman\u201d. The first minister\u2019s tenure has been characterised by an enthusiasm for honouring little-known local heroes or attending events unannounced, where she is happy to risk her dignity singing folk songs with pick-up bands or dressing up in Viking warrior gear, as she did at two recent events. Sturgeon and her aides are sometimes chided for over-thinking their approach to politics and civic engagement, but she gets it right more often than not. Those who encounter her in these moments simply appreciate them for what they are: a warm acknowledgment of their work and lives from the country\u2019s leader, a woman who received no favours or privileges on her own rise to the top. The names of many of Scotland\u2019s most recognisable landmarks that bear an incongruous royal imprint are probably too old and fondly regarded to be changed now. Not so some recent places and buildings. The Queen Elizabeth University hospital is barely four years old and its name hasn\u2019t settled into the folds of the public consciousness. You would hope that, if Scotland gains its independence, the hospitals and infirmaries bizarrely named for impervious royalty will be renamed in favour of those physicians who were born or worked in Scotland and helped advance medical science and care, such as Joseph Lister, Alexander Fleming and Elsie Inglis. After a decent stretch, post-independence Scotland will surely begin to dismantle most manifestations of foolish royal fealty. A grown-up country should be sparing with its garlands and civic beatifications. Only the names of those who have earned our admiration by displaying heroic attributes in the service of others in peacetime and at war should adorn our cherished buildings and spaces. As for Edinburgh\u2019s brand-new government centre, I\u2019d propose Irvine Welsh, Margo MacDonald or Eddie Turnbull. Perhaps, too, in the naming of any new Edinburgh hospital it could be time to overlook the unorthodox methods of William Burke and William Hare. Instead, we should accentuate the positive and recognise their sterling contributions in the cause of medical research: every saint has a past, every sinner has a future. \u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist",

Nothing less patriotic than the behaviour of this government, church and their thugs can be imagined. Michael Kowalewski Melbury Osmond Dorset Stewart Lee \u2013 respect!

      "bodyText": "Anthony Albanese has warned Labor will not support a proposal to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution and establish a voice to parliament if it is too modest to win the support of First Nations people. Speaking after attending the Garma festival in Arnhem Land, the Labor leader told the ABC on Sunday he hoped the Morrison government would listen to the desire of Indigenous people articulated in the Uluru statement, which was to enshrine the voice \u2013 a representative body \u2013 in the constitution. He said the voice would be \u201cmentioned in the constitution so that there\u2019s security, but of course it would be legislated by the parliament with the nature of it\u201d. \u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t put down all of the structures around the voice in the constitution,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThe constitution is a relatively short document. \u201cThe high court itself is mentioned in the constitution, and the detail of it is legislated. So we need to have a debate about what the nature of that voice is. \u201cBut let\u2019s be clear about what First Nations people are asking for. Their ask is modest. It is simply that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be consulted on matters that affect them.\u201d Although Labor has signalled it wanted to achieve bipartisanship with the government on a proposal for constitutional change, Albanese said there was no point in proceeding if the Coalition could not respond to the proposal advanced by Indigenous leaders. \u201cThat would be a pointless exercise, to try and once again impose a solution that wasn\u2019t the product of consultation,\u201d he said, noting the Uluru Statement from the Heart was the product of intensive consultation with Indigenous people. \u201cFirst nations people around the country \u2026 came together and came up with a consensus document,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful document. It\u2019s a strong document. It\u2019s concise and clear. It\u2019s modest in its ask, and I think it is incredibly generous.\u201d In an interview with Guardian Australia\u2019s politics podcast, acclaimed filmmaker Rachel Perkins has urged Australians to support a voice proposal that allows Indigenous people to partner with government \u201cto solve this crisis we have in communities\u201d. Richie Ah Mat, the co-chair of the Cape York Partnership, argues the representative body needs to be enshrined in the constitution: \u201cIf it\u2019s just legislated \u2026 they can say it\u2019s too hard with the blacks, let\u2019s get rid of it with the stroke of a pen.\u201d The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, put constitutional recognition and a version of the voice to parliament back on the national agenda with a speech during Naidoc week. Wyatt, the first Indigenous person to hold the portfolio, promised to work towards holding a referendum on Indigenous recognition within three years. In reviving the debate, he signalled that he wanted to persist with creating some model of the voice from the Uluru statement, but he indicated that a representative body might be legislated, rather than enshrined, in the constitution, which was the position outlined in the Uluru process. Government conservatives have signalled they will resist enshrining it. At the Garma festival, Wyatt said the Coalition believed change could be achieved in three years \u201cbut how we do it is both important and critical\u201d. The former chief justice Murray Gleeson has argued \u201ca constitutionally entrenched but legislatively controlled\u201d capacity for Indigenous people to have input into the making of laws about Indigenous people or Indigenous affairs \u201chardly seems revolutionary\u201d. In July he said that given the constitution makes people the potential objects of special laws by reason of their Indigenous status, \u201cthe referendum council considered that an appropriate form of recognition of such people would be to provide them with a voice to parliament\u201d. At the Garma festival, the prominent Indigenous leader Noel Pearson referred to the Gleeson speech as \u201cthe last word on the legal integrity on the voice and its seamless compatibility with the constitutional history of the Australian commonwealth\u201d. Pearson predicted that people intending to mount a rearguard action against change \u201ccould never take on Mr Gleeson\u2019s words\u201d.",

Lovelock was a rock\u2019n\u2019roll singer (for the Celibate Rifles, the Sydney band he fronted since 1980), solo artist, author, spoken-word performer, football broadcaster for the ABC, Sky and SBS (alongside the late Les Murray), yoga instructor, father to Luke and friend (to the Dalai Lama, among countless others).</p> <p>Above all, he was a fabulous raconteur. Lovelock was a big man with a big voice and a hell of a lot of stories. Silence wasn\u2019t in his vocabulary.

This combination of physical mastery and people skills saw him hired as an instructor by, among others, the New South Wales State of Origin rugby league team.</p> <p>But most of his stories were poured into the lyrics he wrote for the Celibate Rifles, whose name was a pun on the Sex Pistols.

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hong Kong police on Thursday also charged 44 people linked to the protests with \u201crioting\u201d, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.</p> \n<p>Others are increasingly worried about violence and escalating police tactics, which have included firing rubber bullets as well as teargas.

On Sunday, the police said they had arrested 20 people during Saturday\u2019s clashes for offences including unlawful assembly and assault. Police fired teargas and pepper spray, and pinned protesters to the ground after tense standoffs in at least four locations throughout the city on Saturday evening, following a peaceful march earlier in the day. Thousands of protesters attending an anti-government march in Mong Kok deviated from a pre-approved route and occupied main roads in Kowloon, where they built barricades out of dismantled metal traffic barriers, handed out gas masks and helmets, and prepared to face off against police. In Tsim Sha Tsui, a popular shopping district where protesters had gathered to evade the police, authorities fired multiple rounds of teargas outside a police station after demonstrators had thrown rubbish and traffic cones into the compound. Protesters, protecting themselves with plastic traffic barriers and construction panels, eventually retreated to a nearby university. The police said in a statement that protesters had hurled bricks into the station and set fire to objects outside it. Police were also seen subduing demonstrators outside a police station in Mong Kok by forcing them on the ground. Photos showed demonstrators bleeding.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s trade minister says the latest Trump administration threat to impose new tariffs on $300bn worth of Chinese goods could, if it eventuates, breach World Trade Organisation rules. Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, Simon Birmingham said it \u201cmay well\u201d be the case that the US would breach WTO rules. Birmingham, who was in Beijing for trade talks, said China had launched actions in the WTO in response to previous actions by the Trump administration, and the latest threat \u201cis something that has been announced but not yet taken effect\u201d. \u201cThe application of those sorts of unilateral tariff actions is not something we have welcomed and it may well be [a breach of WTO rules], but that is something for the independent process,\u201d he said. Birmingham said a \u201cbigger and more immediate concern\u201d than the process was the practical impact of the escalating dispute on global trade volumes, and on global economic growth. In July the International Monetary Fund in Washington said its outlook was gloomier than it had envisaged three months earlier because of the trade war, Brexit uncertainty and the effect of sanctions against Iran on oil prices. In an update to its half-yearly world economic outlook, the IMF expected global growth to be 0.1 percentage points lower in both 2019 and 2020 than it had envisaged in April, at 3.2% and 3.5% respectively. Trump\u2019s declaration last week that the US would impose 10% tariffs on $300bn worth of Chinese imports caught financial markets on the hop, and share prices fell around the world. With senior US officials in Australia at the weekend for defence talks, and with Birmingham in Beijing to pursue discussions around the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, the trade minister acknowledged that Australia agreed with some elements of Trump\u2019s critique of Chinese trade practices. He said on Sunday the Morrison government wanted to see further action from China on flashpoints such as intellectual property reform. But he also stressed how important Canberra\u2019s trade relationship with Beijing was for Australia\u2019s economic prosperity. He did not have a formal bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart at the partnership discussions, with diplomatic relations between Canberra and Beijing strained by some of the robust commentary around Australia\u2019s move to limit foreign interference. He could also not answer a question about when the prime minister, Scott Morrison, might be invited to visit Beijing. However, he said \u201cdespite some of the negative commentary, two-way trade remains at record levels\u201d and there were record volumes in Australia\u2019s iron ore and wine exports to China. While the trade relationship was healthy, Birmingham was continuing to try to understand why some thermal coal shipments from Australia struggled to clear Chinese ports. The official characterisation of the go slow was that it was not discriminatory and Birmingham said he had asked Chinese officials to work with Australia so exporters could better understand what the checks are. \u201cThis is an issue particular to thermal coal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be some broader issues at play with China trying to manage the volumes of thermal coal coming into the country, but we do want to get to the bottom of whether it is demand management or supply management \u2026 whether it is in relation to environmental checks, and I\u2019ve asked for us to have further dialogue on that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Uniting Church has broken ranks with other religious institutions to throw its support behind decriminalising abortion in New South Wales. NSW is the only Australian state or territory that has neglected to modernise abortion laws. Last week a private member\u2019s bill co-sponsored by 15 MPs from across the political divide was introduced to state parliament. It was expected to be debated as soon as Tuesday when parliament sits. It would remove abortion from the state\u2019s criminal code and create a standalone healthcare act to regulate the procedure. In an open letter to MPs, the Uniting Church reverend Simon Hansford argued abortion was a health and social issue and should not be a criminal issue. \u201cRespect for the sacredness of life means advocating for the needs of women as well as every unborn child,\u201d Hansford said. \u201cWhilst we encourage our ministers to remind people of the sacredness of life, the church\u2019s role should be to offer care and support leading up to and following a decision, not stand in judgment.\u201d Hansford said the church was disturbed that recent comments could imply that women make the decision to have an abortion without proper consideration. \u201cMost women who have abortions do so only after a great deal of searching and anguish,\u201d he said. It\u2019s important not to ignore the many emotional, physical, financial and social issues that often create a situation where a woman is forced to consider an abortion, Hansford said. Hansford\u2019s stand is at odds with that of other churches. On Tuesday the Catholic archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, revealed he had written to the premier, together with the heads of the Anglican and Greek Orthodox churches, calling on her to delay the bill. \u201cIt is the dream bill of the abortion industry, which they have already pressed upon several other states; but it will leave unborn children and unsupported pregnant women even more at risk,\u201d he said. Anglican archbishop Glenn Davies insisted the status quo should remain. \u201cAbortion is available in NSW and the criminal code provisions have not prevented women from seeking abortions,\u201d he said. \u201cRather, the law strengthens the protection of women from pressure, medical malpractice and safeguards the consciences of doctors. In the rare cases that criminal sanctions have been applied, it was clear the circumstances warranted prosecution.\u201d However, some pro-choice groups say some women have been forced to travel interstate in some instances. Last year Queensland\u2019s parliament voted to legalise abortion and erase a 119-year-old \u201cmorality\u201d section of the state\u2019s criminal code. The NSW private member\u2019s bill is based on laws in Queensland and Victoria and has the backing of the Australian Medical Association and the Pro-Choice Alliance. The bill would allow for terminations up to 22 weeks \u2013 and later if two doctors believe they should be performed given the medical, physical, social and psychological circumstances. Premier Gladys Berejiklian backs the bill. \u201cWhat is important to me is for every colleague to have the opportunity ... to express their views frankly and honestly,\u201d Berejiklian said.",

The towers could reach up to 270m high from ground to blade tip.

But in other parts of the country the evidence that windfarms are a major problem for birds is limited, if the projects are appropriately sited and managed.</p> <p>Emma Bennett is an ecologist who has been employed by energy companies to monitor bird and bat kills at about half the windfarms in Victoria. She says while there is good global information, there is a lack of peer-reviewed data about the impact of turbines on Australian bird populations.</p> <p>Bennett developed a technique to estimate bird and bat kills. Trained observation groups and detection dogs are used to find small birds and bats near turbines.

      "bodyText": "Do windfarms kill birds? Unarguably, they have and do. The damage turbines can inflict was infamously highlighted at California\u2019s Altamont Pass, where early industry farms were built in a migratory path. One estimate suggested it killed as many as 1,300 birds of prey a year before changes were made to reduce death rates. But is it a problem in Australia, which now has about 90 windfarms and another 25 on the way? The question has received a burst of attention since the country\u2019s most celebrated conservationist, Bob Brown, strongly objected to a windfarm proposed for Robbins Island, off the north-west Tasmanian coast. Developer UPC Renewables plans to erect up to 163 turbines on the privately owned island. The towers could reach up to 270m high from ground to blade tip. Brown\u2019s criticism is broad, taking in the visual impact, plans to export the electricity to Victoria and the company\u2019s foreign ownership. But it is mostly centred on the threat to migratory birds. After some initial straight reporting, media coverage of Brown\u2019s comments became absorbed into a culture war over the validity of renewable energy. Commentators mostly ignored that the Robbins Island proposal is still at a relative early stage, with planning and environmental applications yet to be submitted. The circumstances at Robbins Island are unusual for an Australian windfarm proposal as the site sits next to an intertidal mudflat visited by several migratory species. But in other parts of the country the evidence that windfarms are a major problem for birds is limited, if the projects are appropriately sited and managed. Emma Bennett is an ecologist who has been employed by energy companies to monitor bird and bat kills at about half the windfarms in Victoria. She says while there is good global information, there is a lack of peer-reviewed data about the impact of turbines on Australian bird populations. Bennett developed a technique to estimate bird and bat kills. Trained observation groups and detection dogs are used to find small birds and bats near turbines. Bird carcasses from elsewhere are left and monitored at windfarms to see how quickly scavengers remove remains. \u201cWe use that to develop an estimate of the impact of the turbines,\u201d Bennett says. She says her results suggest that on average one or two birds are killed by each turbine each year, though there can be variation depending on the site. \u201cWe get really low counts, even lower than studies from overseas,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at the global trend, bats tend to be at greater risk than birds.

She says some individual monitoring should continue, but wants industry and government to back a research fund that would look at the cumulative impact of windfarm development on threatened species. \u201cWhat we want to do is, by pooling all our data and identifying the species most at risk where windfarms are built, work out how to limit risks and offset impacts before they begin,\u201d Bennett says.

It would go to restoring critical habitat, such as wetlands, and reducing fox and feral cat numbers. Research suggests cats kill a million of birds across Australia each day. \u201cIf we can leverage funding from what is a small threat to address larger threats then we will get a better outcome for species at risk,\u201d she says. The whole-of-state approach could help shape where windfarms should be built with a goal of helping species most at risk, such as brolgas, which are threatened in Victoria, and the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot.

      "bodyText": "The federal government is facing a lawsuit over damage done to Indigenous land by the decades-old mining project that sparked the Yirrkala Bark Petitions. Gumatj leader Galarrwuy Yunupingu revealed on Saturday that he and his people were taking legal action against the commonwealth, seeking compensation for the loss of native title over the minerals exploited by mine operator Nabalco and its successor, Rio Tinto, as well as the destruction of key dreaming sites. The suit is expected to use the historic precedent set by the Timber Creek judgment by the high court in March, which ruled on monetary compensation for loss of native title. \u201cThey\u2019ve come to Gove peninsula without asking properly of the landowners of the place,\u201d Yunupingu told the crowd at Garma festival, in north-east Arnhem Land. \u201cThey have all come, getting the OK from the PM and the government of the country, to come all the way and start digging and insulting the country.\u201d He accused the two companies of having \u201cripped some land unmercifully\u201d. \u201cThey have damaged our country without seeking advice to us and they have damaged a lot of dreamings \u2013 dreamings that were important to Aboriginal people.\u201d He said the companies failed to ask the local people where they could and couldn\u2019t go on the Gove peninsula in north-east Arnhem Land. Traditional owners have received royalties from the mine, a fraction of the total revenue drawn from the site. They have recently opened their own mine and training centre, Gulkula Mining, of which Yunupingu is chair. Prospecting for what would become the bauxite mine and refinery began in the 1950s, and Yolngu traditional owners were strongly opposed. Leases were granted and excised without consultation of the people of Yirrkala, and the now historic Yirrkala bark petitions were delivered to the federal government in 1963. Yunupingu, whose father was then Gumatj clan leader, helped draft the petitions. However, the mine went ahead, with the Gove agreement signed five years later between the commonwealth and Nabalco. Traditional owners took the mine to court in 1971, the first ever native title litigation, but lost, with the judge citing the doctrine of terra nullius in his judgement. The loss sparked the establishment of the Woodward royal commission, and NT land rights act. The case flagged by Yunupingu on Saturday will rest on the precedent set by this year\u2019s Timber Creek decision from the high court, which awarded more than $2.5m in compensation to native title holders over dozens of acts by the NT government between 1980 and 1996 which were later found to have \u201cimpaired or extinguished\u201d native title rights and interests. More than half the amount was to compensate for \u201ccultural loss\u201d. The March judgment reduced the amount ordered by the federal court in 2016 but otherwise held up the new precedent of quantifying the monetary value of native title and associated compensation for the removal of land rights. Native title experts responded to the ruling with predictions it would pave the way for potentially billions of dollars in liability payments by Australian governments. The attorney general, Christian Porter, said on Sunday: \u201cThere is a well established process for native title claims and those processes would be followed for any such claim lodged regarding bauxite mining. \u201cI note that at this point what has been said is an intention to lodge a claim and that a claim has not yet been lodged.\u201d",
