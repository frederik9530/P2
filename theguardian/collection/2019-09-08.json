Netanyahu misspoke at Sunday\u2019s weekly cabinet meeting, referring to his UK counterpart Boris Johnson as Boris Yeltsin, the former Russian president who died in 2007. \u201cI\u2019ve returned from a very pleasant visit in London, where I\u2019ve met with Prime Minister Boris Yeltsin and the US defence secretary,\u201d Netanyahu said at the start of the meeting. Cabinet ministers immediately interjected, and Netanyahu gave a wry smile before correcting himself, saying he was checking to see if his colleagues were paying attention. But an official video of the meeting released hours later cuts away from Netanyahu at the moment he says Yeltsin \u2013 instead he\u2019s heard saying \u201cBoris Johnson\u201d. The two premiers met on Thursday during Netanyahu\u2019s snap trip to London. The gaffe comes as Netanyahu fights for his survival ahead of next week\u2019s election re-run. Netanyahu appeared to win the April ballot but his attempts to form a coalition government stalled over disagreements between Jewish ultra-Orthodox parties and secular politicians. His campaign for this poll has portrayed him as a veteran statesman with close relations with world leaders. Twitter reacted with posts superimposing Yeltsin\u2019s face onto Netanyahu re-election posters, which had originally showed him with President Trump. The Israeli media outlet Haaretz reported that this was not Netanyahu\u2019s first mix-up, saying in December he said in a campaign speech that he had been on an official visit to Afghanistan, mixing it up with Azerbaijan.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Peter Hemington, of BDO LLP, said: \u201cThis month\u2019s dramatic fall in confidence is a very worrying event.

Consumer spending, which has provided between 60% and 80% of growth in the economy over the last three years, would also be severely dented.

The central bank and the OBR have predicted a recession in the wake of a no-deal Brexit.

The Resolution Foundation thinktank said its review of the UK\u2019s readiness for a post-Brexit recession found that neither the government nor the Bank of England had the means to prevent the economy slipping into a prolonged downturn. It said policy changes over the last 10 years linked to the government\u2019s austerity programme meant the poorest households had lost access to benefits that protected them in the 2008 crash from falling into extreme poverty. A switch from generous tax credit payments, which topped up wages when workers were forced to accept shorter hours or lost their jobs, to universal credit was a key reason poorer households were more vulnerable in a recession, the thinktank warned. \u201cThe UK\u2019s macroeconomic policy framework has not kept pace with significant changes to our economic environment and is therefore at risk of leaving the country underprepared for the next recession.

The safety of vulnerable mothers and newborn babies is being put at risk by NHS fees that deter undocumented migrant women from accessing care, a new report from Maternity Action backed by the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) has warned. NHS packages for overseas pregnant women start at \u00a37,000 for antenatal, pregnancy and postnatal care, but can rise to thousands of pounds if the mother or child experience complications. Midwives said some women delay accessing help or fail to have scans over fears that they will be charged or detained. In the first study to investigate the impact on midwives of the policy of charging overseas visitors for NHS care, one midwife said she felt as if she was \u201cworking for the Home Office\u201d while another said her job was \u201cbecoming about charging\u201d. The fees particularly harm undocumented migrant women, who already have a heightened risk of maternal death and adverse pregnancy outcomes, according to the report. \u201cI am not here to enforce immigration rules, I am not here to enforce people\u2019s entitlement, I have a duty of care as a midwife and I need to fulfil that duty of care,\u201d one of a group of 15 midwives interviewed for the study said. \u201cPart of my duty of care as a midwife is to gain the trust of people who are giving me medical history, who are entrusting me to guide them through the booking process which is the first step they are taking in pregnancy care.

The study, led by researchers from the University of Queensland and three environment organisations \u2013 the Australian Conservation Foundation, WWF Australia and the Wilderness Society \u2013 warns that Australia\u2019s high extinction rate will increase \u201cwithout a fundamental change\u201d in how environment laws are enforced. The scientists used publicly available spatial data to quantify the amount of clearing of potential habitat for 1,638 listed threatened species and ecological communities \u2013 which are groups of species that form a single habitat \u2013 between 2000 and 2017. They used the federal government referral record to calculate how much of the clearing had been referred to the government for assessment. The study examined two types of habitat \u2013 forests and woodlands \u2013 and excluded clearing that had occurred before the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act came into force in 2000 and any clearing that was due to natural causes such as fire. They calculated that the land cleared included 7.7m hectares of potential habitat for terrestrial threatened species, 64,000 hectares of habitat for terrestrial migratory species, and 330,000 hectares for threatened ecological communities. The researchers found that clearing had affected potential habitat for 84% (or 1,390) of the species studied and that the overwhelming majority of that clearing (93%) had not been referred to the federal government for scrutiny under the EPBC Act. \u201cThis noncompliance means that potential habitat for terrestrial threatened species, terrestrial migratory species and threatened ecological communities have been lost without assessment, regulation or enforcement under the EPBC Act,\u201d they wrote. Some species suffered more habitat loss than others. According to the study, the Mount Cooper striped skink lost 25% of its potential habitat, the Keighery\u2019s macarthuria, a plant native to Western Australia, lost 23% and the southern black-throated finch lost 10%.

A statutory review of the EPBC Act is due to begin this year. Ward said the researchers would be submitting comments based on their research. Their paper says Australia\u2019s national environment laws have been \u201cineffective\u201d at preventing habitat loss and calls for amendments that require critical habitat, where possible, to be mapped and monitored for threatened species and ecological communities, and for protection of that habitat to be enforced. \u201cWe think that the act should be amended so that critical habitat is mapped, available to stakeholders and fully protected from further destruction,\u201d Ward said. James Trezise, a policy analyst at the Australian Conservation Foundation and a co-author on the study, said the research highlighted how national laws had \u201csystematically failed to protect threatened species and their habitats\u201d. \u201cTo potentially have more than 93% of threatened species habitat loss unregulated is completely unacceptable and demonstrates a massive compliance failure under the EPBC Act,\u201d he said. \u201cThese findings should be a wake-up call to the federal government as it gears up to review the EPBC Act and as it enters negotiations for a new global framework for protecting nature through the UN.\u201d New post-2020 targets for nature are due to be established next year under the Convention on Biological Diversity.

      "bodyText": "Marcus Rashford has been encouraged by England\u2019s coaching staff to modify his style and make better use of his speed in an attacking trio that Gareth Southgate now believes is as accomplished as any strikeforce in international football. Southgate and his colleagues believe the Manchester United forward could be more effective if he spends less time dropping back to look for the ball and concentrated instead on using his phenomenal pace to get behind opposition defences. The England manager was full of praise for the impact of his three-pronged attack, with Harry Kane flanked by Rashford and Raheem Sterling, in Saturday\u2019s 4-0 defeat of Bulgaria but there was also some constructive criticism for a player who, by Southgate\u2019s own admission, is not perhaps best deployed as an orthodox centre-forward. \u201cAlthough we have, for a long time, almost wanted Marcus to be that option as a [No] 9, I\u2019m still not certain that that is where he is happiest and where he does his best work,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cA lot of his development at United was as a wide raider and he isn\u2019t as strong as Harry with his back to goal and holding play up. \u201cA lot of his best work is in that inside-left channel, coming in off the line, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem. I just think we have to be aware that\u2019s probably his profile and to get the best out of him they are the areas of the pitch that we need to get him into regularly. \u201cI think he can threaten teams in behind more. When he opens his legs and he runs in behind defences that\u2019s the last place they want to be. What happened with the penalty [for England\u2019s second goal], that\u2019s what you want to see. Sometimes he wants to come to the ball [when] I\u2019d be happy with that as a defender. We are encouraging our players to use their strengths.\u201d The emphasis, according to Southgate, is for Rashford to think more about his game positionally, taking up parts of the pitch where he can take advantage of his speed, rather than working on the areas where he is not necessarily so strong. \u201cI can remember Kevin [Keegan] trying to get Michael [Owen] to come to the ball and hold it up,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt was throwing Michael a little bit because his game was to get in behind teams and that\u2019s where his goals had come from. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because a player\u2019s attributes are formed relatively early.

Just hours after the verdict, the Independent Office for Police Conduct announced that no Metropolitan police officers would face misconduct charges over their role in Scotland Yard\u2019s controversial \u00a32.5m inquiry into the claims, Operation Midland.</p> <p>Proctor and his lawyers met IOPC director general Michael Lockwood on Thursday. The former MP\u2019s statement, published through his lawyers Geoffrey Robertson QC and Mark Stephens CBE accused the IOPC of whitewashing the investigation into Beech\u2019s claims and not being independent of the police.</p> <p>It said Lockwood had tried at the meeting to justify the credibility investigating officers gave to Beech\u2019s allegations on the ground that victims should be believed.</p> <p>In response, Robertson said: \u201cThey knew his allegations were not only incredible and inconsistent, but there was not a shred of evidence to confirm them. To assert, and to leave that assertion on the record for nine months, that his allegations were true, amounted to a public declaration by Scotland Yard that distinguished men were guilty of the vilest crimes of murder and rape of children.</p> <p>\u201cTo fail to condemn this police misbehaviour in the strongest terms and at the first opportunity, is a dereliction of duty.\u201d</p> <p>Proctor\u2019s criticism comes before the promised full release of the 2016 Henriques report reviewing Scotland Yard\u2019s investigation, which found 43 failings by detectives on the case. A previously published version had been heavily redacted. The Met police could not provide an exact publication date when contacted by the Guardian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/27/carl-beech-plausibility-of-liars-paucity-of-proof\">Carl Beech \u2013 the plausibility of liars and the paucity of proof | Matthew Scott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the report\u2019s findings, the IOPC said the three Scotland Yard officers who investigated the allegations had no case to answer and the watchdog found no evidence that anybody had deliberately withheld evidence from court applications with the intention of misleading a district judge.</p> <p>Proctor was allowed by the Met to read the full Henriques report in late August. He said he could not discuss the details, because he had signed a confidentiality agreement but added that he \u201cunderstood why they didn\u2019t publish it in full\u201d.</p> <p>In July, the IOPC said investigators had analysed a \u201cvast amount\u201d of material before finding that officers had no case to answer, including documents from Operation Midland and the Henriques review, which indicated officers may have misled a district judge to get a warrant for the investigation.</p> <p>Robertson added: \u201cThey are never recorded or transcribed in any way so police can get away with misleading the court and even telling lies \u2013 because there is no record, they would never be held accountable. If the IOPC are really concerned to guard against police misconduct, it must recommend that all police applications for search and arrest warrants must be recorded.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC said in a statement that its work was done independently of the police, government and interest groups, adding that while none of the officers were found to have deliberately withheld evidence, their investigation identified shortcomings.</p> <p>The statement read: \u201cWe met with Mr Proctor in good faith to listen to and understand his concerns, some of which we have a different view of. However, we also found many areas of commonality.</p> <p>\u201cWe appreciate Mr Proctor has experienced considerable distress and anxiety as a result of the allegations made about him, which were ultimately found to be false. It is important that we identify learning from the experiences of victims and do all we can to ensure the mistakes made are never repeated again.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A former Conservative MP falsely accused of child rape and murder has condemned the police watchdog for clearing the Met officers who investigated the allegations, following a meeting with its director. Harvey Proctor said in a statement released on Sunday that the watchdog had failed in its duty to protect the public from police incompetence, gross negligence, and \u201cinstitutional stupidity\u201d. The formerly MP for Basildon and Billericay was among a series of high-profile establishment figures wrongly accused by jailed fantasist Carl Beech of being part of a fictitious murderous VIP paedophile ring. Beech was convicted in July of lying about the extraordinary claims and later sentenced to 18 years in prison. Just hours after the verdict, the Independent Office for Police Conduct announced that no Metropolitan police officers would face misconduct charges over their role in Scotland Yard\u2019s controversial \u00a32.5m inquiry into the claims, Operation Midland. Proctor and his lawyers met IOPC director general Michael Lockwood on Thursday. The former MP\u2019s statement, published through his lawyers Geoffrey Robertson QC and Mark Stephens CBE accused the IOPC of whitewashing the investigation into Beech\u2019s claims and not being independent of the police. It said Lockwood had tried at the meeting to justify the credibility investigating officers gave to Beech\u2019s allegations on the ground that victims should be believed. In response, Robertson said: \u201cThey knew his allegations were not only incredible and inconsistent, but there was not a shred of evidence to confirm them. To assert, and to leave that assertion on the record for nine months, that his allegations were true, amounted to a public declaration by Scotland Yard that distinguished men were guilty of the vilest crimes of murder and rape of children. \u201cTo fail to condemn this police misbehaviour in the strongest terms and at the first opportunity, is a dereliction of duty.\u201d Proctor\u2019s criticism comes before the promised full release of the 2016 Henriques report reviewing Scotland Yard\u2019s investigation, which found 43 failings by detectives on the case. A previously published version had been heavily redacted. The Met police could not provide an exact publication date when contacted by the Guardian. Despite the report\u2019s findings, the IOPC said the three Scotland Yard officers who investigated the allegations had no case to answer and the watchdog found no evidence that anybody had deliberately withheld evidence from court applications with the intention of misleading a district judge. Proctor was allowed by the Met to read the full Henriques report in late August. He said he could not discuss the details, because he had signed a confidentiality agreement but added that he \u201cunderstood why they didn\u2019t publish it in full\u201d. In July, the IOPC said investigators had analysed a \u201cvast amount\u201d of material before finding that officers had no case to answer, including documents from Operation Midland and the Henriques review, which indicated officers may have misled a district judge to get a warrant for the investigation. Robertson added: \u201cThey are never recorded or transcribed in any way so police can get away with misleading the court and even telling lies \u2013 because there is no record, they would never be held accountable. If the IOPC are really concerned to guard against police misconduct, it must recommend that all police applications for search and arrest warrants must be recorded.\u201d The IOPC said in a statement that its work was done independently of the police, government and interest groups, adding that while none of the officers were found to have deliberately withheld evidence, their investigation identified shortcomings. The statement read: \u201cWe met with Mr Proctor in good faith to listen to and understand his concerns, some of which we have a different view of. However, we also found many areas of commonality. \u201cWe appreciate Mr Proctor has experienced considerable distress and anxiety as a result of the allegations made about him, which were ultimately found to be false. It is important that we identify learning from the experiences of victims and do all we can to ensure the mistakes made are never repeated again.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxvUuSzbMI\">weddings in Westeros</a>, parties in Peaky Blinders never end well. So it was no surprise that Lizzie\u2019s cocaine- and brandy-laced ballet gala culminated in high emotion, attempted murder and brutal death.</p> <p>The sad demise was poor Linda\u2019s as she forced her reckoning with Arthur only to be shot by Polly (conveniently just as Swan Lake\u2019s Odette breathed her last in front of an amusingly less-than-rapt audience). It was a gloriously dramatic and entirely over-the-top ending to a beautifully-shot episode, even though I have to acknowledge this season\u2019s growing flaws.</p> <p>Chief among them is that it\u2019s hard to escape the idea that all we\u2019re watching is so much stylish plate spinning. One of the great joys of Peaky Blinders has always been the way in which Tommy Shelby\u2019s ever-whirring brain is scheming behind the scenes only for the truth to be revealed at the last. However, there are only so many times you can go back to that well and there is an increasing sense that, even as the enemies keep multiplying, we have seen this all before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29e82011db01b149f33bdace3636a335eab99830\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29e82011db01b149f33bdace3636a335eab99830/0_35_4284_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ever-whirring brain ... Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And for all that I enjoy the theatrical confrontations between Tommy and Mosley (and Cillian Murphy has been particularly good this series), and relish the faux-Shakespearian dialogue given to the various antagonists from Jimmy McCavern to Andrew Koji\u2019s new arrival, Brilliant Chang, it\u2019s also true that the show continues to walk a fine line between thoroughly compelling and ludicrously self-parodic.</p> <p>I still love watching Peaky Blinders because it\u2019s the gaudy, over-stuffed drama of my dreams, but I understand those wondering if all that sound and fury adds up to much of anything.</p> <h2><strong>Our heroes</strong></h2> <p>The show does remain particularly good when concentrating on the way in which the carelessness of Polly\u2019s \u201cbold people\u201d wrecks lives. From the increasingly terrified Billy Grade, out of his depth and desperate to quit the match-fixing game, to Linda, hurting and determined to end an evil she could no longer countenance, the true cost of involvement with the Peaky Blinders continues to be made desperately clear.</p> <p>Would a bolder drama have seen Linda kill Arthur (who arguably was stepping forward to die anyway)? Possibly, but I bought Polly\u2019s intervention. She has always been prepared to get blood on her hands for the family and knew that if someone didn\u2019t pull the trigger then every part of the Shelby empire would begin to topple and fall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1eaf0c75988f6c6e2f9deb0dc0230c67e77e1b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1eaf0c75988f6c6e2f9deb0dc0230c67e77e1b5/0_186_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polly Gray (Helen McCrory) and Arthur Shelby (Paul Anderson).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polly Gray and Arthur Shelby (Paul Anderson).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s also arguable that this season has been partially about Polly\u2019s reinvigorated sense of herself. Having suffered and survived the trials of previous seasons, she has come to terms with who and what she is and no longer appears particularly concerned about having to play by any of society\u2019s rules.</p> <p>That said, would Aberama really have put his great plans of murderous vengeance on hold for marriage? On balance, I felt yes, but only because Aidan Gillen sold both Aberama\u2019s love for Polly and, more importantly, the respect he feels. The bigger question, of course, is why did Polly agree?</p> <p>The obvious answer is that it concerns her son\u2019s survival, although I\u2019m beginning to wonder why. Gina clearly controls the brains in the relationship even if Michael might have a nice future in interior design.</p> <h2><strong>The bad guys</strong></h2> <p>In contrast to the society-denying Shelbys, Oswald Mosley remains very, very keen to remind everyone of the existing rules and whether one should play by them.</p> <p>What I find interesting is the question of just how many steps ahead or behind the politician might be. Is he so careless of the little people and so confident in his own perceived superiority as he slums it at a \u201cgypsy party\u201d, that he truly believes he has bent Tommy to his will? Or does he understand that far more is going on?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6df7b3db51b626d097d23e3aa9f2c10bf7cc000d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6df7b3db51b626d097d23e3aa9f2c10bf7cc000d/0_135_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Gray (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Michael Gray (Finn Cole).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gina Gray (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Michael Gray (Finn Cole).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sam Claflin\u2019s ambiguous performance suggests either answer might be true. And while I have my doubts that a man as sharp as Mosley would so carelessly put his name to a piece of paper, it should also be noted that the gossip about his sleeping arrangements (which were <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6589071/British-fascist-leader-Oswald-Mosleys-affairs-wifes-sisters-stepmother.html\">revealed in letters from his second wife, Diana Mitford</a>) suggests a man who likes sailing close to the edge, who thinks consequences are for lesser mortals, and who doesn\u2019t really believe he will be caught.</p> <p>And what of that paper trail? Surely it\u2019s not as simple as Tommy hoping to link Mosley to the heroin trade via the Billy Boys? Is he really going to double cross the Chinese? And, most importantly, is he setting up Michael to take the fall \u2013 and if so, does Polly know? Because it\u2019s hard to imagine that the answer to that question is yes, and if it\u2019s no then things are going to get very dicey indeed.</p> <h2><strong>Notes from the boardroom</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"212b27613daae0d7c0032f6a630b44ec5036fc79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/212b27613daae0d7c0032f6a630b44ec5036fc79/0_141_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oswald Mosley (Sam Clafin) and Polly Gray (Helen McCrory).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polly Gray with Oswald Mosley (Sam Clafin).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The aptly named Brilliant Chang, trader of opium and dispenser of wisdom, is played by Andrew Koji, also to be seen in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/05/bruce-lee-daughter-shannon-resurrecting-lost-tv-epic-warrior-we-righted-the-wrong\">Warrior on Sky One</a>, another heavily stylised period piece that I have a soft spot for.</p></li> <li><p>I\u2019m a big fan of the relationship between Ada and Tommy.

      "bodyText": "Like weddings in Westeros, parties in Peaky Blinders never end well. So it was no surprise that Lizzie\u2019s cocaine- and brandy-laced ballet gala culminated in high emotion, attempted murder and brutal death. The sad demise was poor Linda\u2019s as she forced her reckoning with Arthur only to be shot by Polly (conveniently just as Swan Lake\u2019s Odette breathed her last in front of an amusingly less-than-rapt audience). It was a gloriously dramatic and entirely over-the-top ending to a beautifully-shot episode, even though I have to acknowledge this season\u2019s growing flaws. Chief among them is that it\u2019s hard to escape the idea that all we\u2019re watching is so much stylish plate spinning. One of the great joys of Peaky Blinders has always been the way in which Tommy Shelby\u2019s ever-whirring brain is scheming behind the scenes only for the truth to be revealed at the last. However, there are only so many times you can go back to that well and there is an increasing sense that, even as the enemies keep multiplying, we have seen this all before. And for all that I enjoy the theatrical confrontations between Tommy and Mosley (and Cillian Murphy has been particularly good this series), and relish the faux-Shakespearian dialogue given to the various antagonists from Jimmy McCavern to Andrew Koji\u2019s new arrival, Brilliant Chang, it\u2019s also true that the show continues to walk a fine line between thoroughly compelling and ludicrously self-parodic. I still love watching Peaky Blinders because it\u2019s the gaudy, over-stuffed drama of my dreams, but I understand those wondering if all that sound and fury adds up to much of anything. Our heroes The show does remain particularly good when concentrating on the way in which the carelessness of Polly\u2019s \u201cbold people\u201d wrecks lives. From the increasingly terrified Billy Grade, out of his depth and desperate to quit the match-fixing game, to Linda, hurting and determined to end an evil she could no longer countenance, the true cost of involvement with the Peaky Blinders continues to be made desperately clear. Would a bolder drama have seen Linda kill Arthur (who arguably was stepping forward to die anyway)? Possibly, but I bought Polly\u2019s intervention. She has always been prepared to get blood on her hands for the family and knew that if someone didn\u2019t pull the trigger then every part of the Shelby empire would begin to topple and fall. It\u2019s also arguable that this season has been partially about Polly\u2019s reinvigorated sense of herself. Having suffered and survived the trials of previous seasons, she has come to terms with who and what she is and no longer appears particularly concerned about having to play by any of society\u2019s rules. That said, would Aberama really have put his great plans of murderous vengeance on hold for marriage? On balance, I felt yes, but only because Aidan Gillen sold both Aberama\u2019s love for Polly and, more importantly, the respect he feels. The bigger question, of course, is why did Polly agree? The obvious answer is that it concerns her son\u2019s survival, although I\u2019m beginning to wonder why. Gina clearly controls the brains in the relationship even if Michael might have a nice future in interior design. The bad guys In contrast to the society-denying Shelbys, Oswald Mosley remains very, very keen to remind everyone of the existing rules and whether one should play by them. What I find interesting is the question of just how many steps ahead or behind the politician might be. Is he so careless of the little people and so confident in his own perceived superiority as he slums it at a \u201cgypsy party\u201d, that he truly believes he has bent Tommy to his will? Or does he understand that far more is going on? Sam Claflin\u2019s ambiguous performance suggests either answer might be true. And while I have my doubts that a man as sharp as Mosley would so carelessly put his name to a piece of paper, it should also be noted that the gossip about his sleeping arrangements (which were revealed in letters from his second wife, Diana Mitford) suggests a man who likes sailing close to the edge, who thinks consequences are for lesser mortals, and who doesn\u2019t really believe he will be caught. And what of that paper trail? Surely it\u2019s not as simple as Tommy hoping to link Mosley to the heroin trade via the Billy Boys? Is he really going to double cross the Chinese? And, most importantly, is he setting up Michael to take the fall \u2013 and if so, does Polly know? Because it\u2019s hard to imagine that the answer to that question is yes, and if it\u2019s no then things are going to get very dicey indeed. Notes from the boardroom The aptly named Brilliant Chang, trader of opium and dispenser of wisdom, is played by Andrew Koji, also to be seen in Warrior on Sky One, another heavily stylised period piece that I have a soft spot for. I\u2019m a big fan of the relationship between Ada and Tommy. She is the one member of the family he lets his guard down with. The rapprochement between Lizzie and Tommy also continues to work. Their dynamic compels because it\u2019s not as uneven as it appears to the outside world. I also enjoyed her handling of Mosley. As I repeatedly say, people underestimate Lizzie because they see her past, but not the reckoning she made with it. I\u2019m also a massive fan of everyone mocking Finn. That said, I do fear that he veers towards the late, great John Shelby school of \u201cshout first and think about solutions later\u201d. A cheque for Jimmy\u2019s wife to buy a black dress to wear while a black horse wearing black feathers pulls a black carriage \u2013 oh Tommy! There\u2019s stretching a metaphor and then there\u2019s extending it beyond all reason. Talking of overworked metaphors, I was delighted to see the return of the cursed jewel of unexpected death during Tommy\u2019s latest bit of Grace-o-Vision. Ah Grace, you (or rather Tommy\u2019s increasingly troubled subconscious) might say it was Tommy\u2019s fault you died and not the curse, but let\u2019s face it, he dreamt about the jewel and death came to another Shelby party. Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week The song playing while Tommy sold his soul in parliament might have been very reminiscent of John Cooper Clarke, but was actually south London band Hotel Lux\u2019s The Last Hangman. Quote of the week \u201cYou sit on your throne and you instruct Polly Gray, who is of far richer blood than you, as to when she can and when she can\u2019t marry \u2026\u201d Rather sweetly Aberama Gold turns out to be far more than just a wandering-accented vengeance machine. So what did you think? Can the Shelbys contain the fallout from Linda\u2019s death, or is a reckoning coming? Will Tommy finally be undone by one of his double (triple) crosses? And if you were going to have your house designed, would you consider thrusting young up-and-comer Michael Gray? As always all speculation and no spoilers welcome below \u2026",

      "bodyText": "And that, folks, is that. It\u2019s been a blast \u2013 cheerio! Italy have done just enough in Tampere to maintain their 100% record. Jorginho the hero with a late penalty, while Finaldn miss the chance to open up clear ground between them and Armenia in third. An unlikely point for the visitors, and an uncomfortable inquest, you\u2019d imagine, for Greece. The substitute gets his second with a classic poacher\u2019s goal, scooting across the front of a dozing defender to nod in Gaya\u2019s cross. And that\u2019s full-time. Honours even in Sweden, which leaves those two teams and Romania separated by just two points, underneath leaders Spain, with four games to play. Spain finish on a high as Thiago motors into the box and pings it square to the substitute Alc\u00e1cer, who toe-pokes home first time. All square in Athens, where Salanovic has netted late on to very likely salvage Liechtenstein a point. That would be a quite the result: Lichtenstein\u2019s total population is roughly half the capacity of the stadium Greece are hosting them in. The momentum swings again in Finland, and it\u2019s a second penalty. Vaisanen is penalised for handball in the box. Jorginho takes and duly does his skippy little run-up thing, waiting for the keeper to dive before sliding the ball tantalisingly into the other corner. Jim Ramsdale chips in to the the strikers/centre-backs chat: \u201cNo doubt before your time, mine too, but what about the outstanding Big John Charles of Leeds United, Torino and Wales?\u201d I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re wildly wrong there, Jim: JC played for Juventus. Fun in Gijon, where the Faroes mount yet another bold attack, forcing De Gea to come screaming off his line to smother at the striker\u2019s feet, before Manchester City new boy Rodri rattles one from range, Nielsen getting down low to his right to claw it away. Italy enjoy their lead for a full 12 minutes before surrendering it in silly fashion, Sensi bringing down Teemu Pukki in his own box. The striker gets up to take it himself and, after Donnaruma is booked for trying to delay the taking of it, slots cooly home. Doug Green gets in touch to add Olivier Giroud\u2019s name to the list of strikers who defend well in their own box \u2013 very true. In fact, Giroud may well be better at stopping goals than scoring them. Like an inverse Sergio Ramos. Italy break the deadlock in Helsinki Tempere as Chiesa bends a lovely cross from the right, met with conviction by the head of Ciro Immobile at the back post. Top corner, in off the bar. I called him a goal-shy striker earlier \u2013 and he\u2019s certainly proved those words wrong (probably what spurred him on) It\u2019s level in Stockholm, RB Leipzig\u2019s striker Emil Forsber steers the ball expertly home from the edge of the box after good feet by Albin Ekdal. Released down the left channel, the striker controls and begins to make inroads towards the corner of the penalty box. Invited further still by a lamblike defence, he works the ball on to his left foot and bends the ball firmly into the far corner. Laughably easy, but a lovely finish nonetheless. And before you\u2019ve had time to catch your breath, the second halves are under way. \u201cRight up until the Norwegian goal, my main takeaway from the first half had been how amazing Alexander Isak is at heading the ball,\u201d writes Karl Ruben Weseth. \u201cAt 19, he\u2019s dominating completely in the box on defensive set pieces. Who\u2019s your favourite striker-who-does-work-in-his-own-box, Alex? A fine question, to which there\u2019s only one sane answer: Peter Crouch. But honorary mentions go to Didier Drogba and Luca Toni. And that\u2019s not to mentions the strikers \u2013 Dion Dublin, Chris Sutton and, yes, Dimitar Berbatov \u2013 who have spent time moonlighting as centre-backs. Any more for any more? And that\u2019s half-time all round. Finland 0-0 Italy, Greece 1-0 Liechtenstein, Spain 1-0 Faroe Islands, Sweden 0-1 Norway. Get the kettle on. It\u2019s first blood to the visitors in the Stockholm showdown. A woefully underhit ball by Andreas Granqvist to his centre-back partner Victor Lindel\u00f6f is pounced on by Josh King, who drives towards goal before squaring for the captain to rifle home. He races over to the away section while Granqvisk sinks to the turf, head in hands. The Faroes storm forth again! This time it\u2019s Brandur Hendriksson Olsen who breaks away down the right, haring into yards of open ground. He gets to the byline and curls in a dangerous cross towards the only Finn to have kept up with him, but a backtracking Ramos does just enough as the striker strains in vain to meet the cross. Shortly beforehand, Spain threatened to double their lead when Dani Parejo drifted a lovely pass over the visitors\u2019 defence. Thiago leapt to beat the keeper to the ball but his header fell wide of a open goal. And the Athens crowd goes wild as Georgios Masouras fires the hosts into a first-half lead. It owes much to the ineptitude of Efthymis Koulouris, whose wildly struck shot from the edge of the box is sliced into the ground and bouncing harmlessly wide until his striker partner pops up to divert the shot in. The Faroe Islands mount an attack! J\u00f3annes Bjartal\u00ed\u00f0 pounces on some sloppy Spain play on the halfway line and charges forward, a teammate in support. He declines to pass, drilling his shot low from the edge of the box, and it\u2019s saved comfortably by De Gea. File under: faint glimmer. It was Teemu Pukki who Emerson was scampering after as he injured himself, and the Finn\u2019s tormenting of Chelsea players continues apace as he draws a bad foul from Jorginho. Yellow card. Greece v Liechtenstein: one for the diehards. The first of many? A series of Faroe Islanders make a hash of trying to clear the ball on the edge of their own box with Spain\u2019s midfield harrying and blocking. It\u2019s a bit of a mess but eventually the ball breaks to Oyarzabal, who draws the keeper for Rodrigo to slide into an open goal. Good news for Marcos Alonso as Emerson limps off injured for Italy. Chin up, Lamps. And we\u2019re off. And Spain have started off with \u2013 get this \u2013 a spell of intricate possession play in midfield. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect goals galore in Helsinki tonight,\u201d disagrees Antti Lustilla via email. \u201cThe game is in fact played 100 miles away in Tampere!\u201d Good point, well made. Here\u2019s a reminder of what happened yesterday, featuring some national anthem-based hilarity at the Stade de France: Nine changes for Spain \u2013 for whom anything other than a comfortable victory will be a deep and profound failure \u2013 and five for Italy, including goal-shy Ciro Immobile reinstated up front and the veteran/novice pairing of Francesco Acerbi and Leo Bonnuci to keep guard of Teemu Pukki.

Its business is paying retirement pensions, as well as disability, unemployment and housing benefits. </p> \n<p>It ought to be a staid administrative department, but thanks to a near decade of botched welfare reform and divisive benefit cuts, it has become a constant source of political controversy.</p> \n<p>Rudd\u2019s resignation refocuses attention on these myriad problems.

It has fuelled a never-ending stream of stories illustrating how its classic opaque, computer-says-no digital bureaucracy has driven already-struggling people into destitution and despair: the humiliation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/06/universal-credit-surge-in-food-bank-use-trussell-trust\">reliance on food banks</a>, the stress of debt and rent arrears, the looming threat of eviction.</p> \n<p>When Rudd arrived at the DWP, she took many by surprise. Unlike her predecessor, the abrasive Esther McVey, who was loth to admit to any shortcomings at all in the government\u2019s flagship social security policies, Rudd straight away set a different tone.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter so many ideologues, she seemed a force for good,\u201d said one charity campaigner. \u201cShe was a cheerleader for universal credit, but her eyes were open to its problems, she listened to other views and she had the ability to think afresh.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ab483870-4628-4eb2-ab87-a24777ce0a93\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is universal credit?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/universal-credit\">Universal credit</a> (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits (including unemployment and benefits, and tax credits) into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How long has it been around?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/19/universal-credit-failings-pac-accuses-dwp\">management failures</a>, expensive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/05/universal-credit-iain-duncan-smith\">IT blunders and design faults</a>&nbsp; means it is six years behind schedule and <a href=\"https://www.24housing.co.uk/news/push-back-to-full-roll-out-of-universal-credit/\">rollout will not be complete until 2023</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the biggest problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The original design set out&nbsp; a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2016/jun/09/debt-and-food-banks-the-legacy-of-universal-credits-long-hello\">minimum 42-day wait for a first payment</a>&nbsp;to claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/universal-credit-flaws-pushing-claimants-towards-debt-and-eviction-warning?platform=hootsuite\">rent arrears and eviction</a>s, hunger (food banks in UC areas report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/25/food-banks-report-record-demand-amid-universal-credit-chaos\">notable increases in referrals</a>), use of expensive credit and mental distress.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Ministers have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Are there other problems?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plenty.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/03/universal-credit-cost-cutting-treasury-benefit-reform-resolution\">Multibillion-pound cuts to work allowances</a>&nbsp;imposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than \u00a31,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. <br></p>\n    <p>Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It's also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. <br></p>\n    <p>And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/universal-credit-savaged-by-public-spending-watchdog-nao\">critical study</a> found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Straight off, she admitted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/19/amber-rudd-warns-of-further-delays-to-universal-credit\">not all was well</a> with universal credit (a departure from the standard DWP line that everything was going swimmingly). She accepted that the long wait for a first benefit payment helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/11/universal-credit-rollout-linked-to-rising-food-bank-use-amber-rudd-admits\">drive people to food banks </a>(unbelievably, the DWP had flatly denied this for five years). She ended the barbarous and unnecessary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/09/tories-ditch-ineffective-three-year-benefit-sanctions\">three-year benefit sanctions</a> introduced by Iain Duncan Smith (though she resisted calls to end all sanctions).</p> \n<p>Campaigners point out that she was alert to the sexism and misogyny built into universal credit. She overhauled the unworkable upfront childcare payments that prevented many mothers from returning to work. </p> \n<p>She accepted (in opposition to the established DWP view) that a malfunctioning benefit system drove desperately poor women to prostitution, and agreed to a review of single household payments of universal credit that were a potential gift to abusive partners.</p> \n<p>These were not major structural changes. But Rudd at least recognised, says one observer, that \u201csocial security and universal credit is a big deal, that if you get it wrong it can end up as your poll tax\u201d.</p> \n<p>The latest turmoil at the top does not bode well: universal credit is about to be rolled out to 3 million more people, including vulnerable claimants on employment and support allowance, and working families on tax credits.</p> \n<p>Multiple dangers lie ahead: an insular, slow-moving DWP that needs careful political management but has no clear political steer. A minority government which does not see social security as one of the \u201cpeople\u2019s priorities\u201d for public investment, despite rising poverty and growing destitution. A long period of Brexit-related political turbulence preventing any serious reform of social security. The outlook is not sunny.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Amber Rudd\u2019s departure from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) brings to six the number of secretaries of state it has got through in less than four years: an alarming top job turnover rate in any organisation, but particularly destabilising in what is not only the government\u2019s biggest spending department but one of its most politically sensitive ones. The DWP has a budget of about \u00a3185bn a year \u2013 outstripping NHS expenditure by about \u00a320bn and almost double what is spent on schools. Its business is paying retirement pensions, as well as disability, unemployment and housing benefits. It ought to be a staid administrative department, but thanks to a near decade of botched welfare reform and divisive benefit cuts, it has become a constant source of political controversy. Rudd\u2019s resignation refocuses attention on these myriad problems. At their centre is the much-criticised universal credit, the DWP\u2019s flawed but ambitious plan to digitise and streamline the sprawling benefits system. It has cost billions, proved a nightmare to implement and is six years behind schedule, while its design flaws \u2013 the notorious five-week wait for a first benefit payment, for example \u2013 have delivered chaos and misery to thousands of unlucky claimants. The DWP is currently engaged in a not always successful attempt to patch up universal credit\u2019s multiple deficiencies. It is coping with other staggering policy failures too: poorly designed and ineptly administered disability benefits \u2013 the notorious \u201cfit for work\u201d tests, for example, that have seen the DWP become a byword for callousness and bureaucratic cruelty. There have been a suite of nasty policies seemingly designed to impoverish families \u2013 such as limiting benefits to the first two children. And all against the backdrop of a four-year austerity freeze on benefits, which has been the main contributor to more than \u00a330bn being stripped from the budgets of poorer households in recent years. The failures of universal credit have been a gift to an opposition keen to show the Tories do not care about the poor. It has fuelled a never-ending stream of stories illustrating how its classic opaque, computer-says-no digital bureaucracy has driven already-struggling people into destitution and despair: the humiliation of reliance on food banks, the stress of debt and rent arrears, the looming threat of eviction. When Rudd arrived at the DWP, she took many by surprise. Unlike her predecessor, the abrasive Esther McVey, who was loth to admit to any shortcomings at all in the government\u2019s flagship social security policies, Rudd straight away set a different tone. \u201cAfter so many ideologues, she seemed a force for good,\u201d said one charity campaigner. \u201cShe was a cheerleader for universal credit, but her eyes were open to its problems, she listened to other views and she had the ability to think afresh.\u201d Straight off, she admitted that not all was well with universal credit (a departure from the standard DWP line that everything was going swimmingly). She accepted that the long wait for a first benefit payment helped drive people to food banks (unbelievably, the DWP had flatly denied this for five years). She ended the barbarous and unnecessary three-year benefit sanctions introduced by Iain Duncan Smith (though she resisted calls to end all sanctions). Campaigners point out that she was alert to the sexism and misogyny built into universal credit. She overhauled the unworkable upfront childcare payments that prevented many mothers from returning to work. She accepted (in opposition to the established DWP view) that a malfunctioning benefit system drove desperately poor women to prostitution, and agreed to a review of single household payments of universal credit that were a potential gift to abusive partners. These were not major structural changes. But Rudd at least recognised, says one observer, that \u201csocial security and universal credit is a big deal, that if you get it wrong it can end up as your poll tax\u201d. The latest turmoil at the top does not bode well: universal credit is about to be rolled out to 3 million more people, including vulnerable claimants on employment and support allowance, and working families on tax credits. Multiple dangers lie ahead: an insular, slow-moving DWP that needs careful political management but has no clear political steer. A minority government which does not see social security as one of the \u201cpeople\u2019s priorities\u201d for public investment, despite rising poverty and growing destitution. A long period of Brexit-related political turbulence preventing any serious reform of social security. The outlook is not sunny.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will fly to Dublin to meet the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, on Monday, as he battles to show that his Brexit plan remains on track after Amber Rudd dramatically quit the cabinet. Against a backdrop of mounting disquiet inside government at Johnson\u2019s gung-ho approach and the combative style of his chief strategist Dominic Cummings, the British prime minister hopes to demonstrate that he is serious about negotiating a fresh Brexit deal. When he returns from Dublin later on Monday, Johnson is expected to make a second bid to trigger a 15 October general election by asking MPs to support a motion tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. But he is almost certain to be rebuffed for a second time, after opposition leaders agreed on Friday to reject a snap poll until a no-deal Brexit has been definitively avoided. The backbench bill aimed at blocking no deal is expected to receive royal assent on Monday. Rudd\u2019s abrupt departure followed that of the prime minister\u2019s brother, Jo Johnson, who resigned last week after 21 rebels lost the Conservative whip for supporting what Downing Street calls \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill\u201d. Rudd\u2019s resignation on Saturday evening sparked fears of a domino effect, with other Tory moderates following suit. Since tendering her resignation, Rudd has been approached by three cabinet ministers and nine junior ministers who have expressed concern about the direction of the government, a friend said, adding that she would not be at all surprised if there were more resignations. Her final conversation with the PM took place on Saturday evening, when she called him 10 minutes before an article revealing her resignation was due to be launched online. An agitated Johnson pleaded with her to reconsider. \u201cThe PM wanted to know why she hadn\u2019t told him first. But it is obvious why and she told him: \u2018Boris, you have some pretty brutal advisers,\u2019\u201d a Rudd aide said. Downing Street launched a shoring-up operation, with Johnson himself speaking to key potential waverers. Cabinet ministers known to have anxieties, including Matt Hancock, Julian Smith and Robert Buckland, made clear on Sunday they intended to remain in the government. Hancock has been lobbying for the whip to be restored to the rebels, according to friends, while Buckland, the justice secretary, tweeted that he had spoken to the prime minister \u201cregarding the importance of the Rule of Law, which I as Lord Chancellor have taken an oath to uphold\u201d. Johnson has insisted he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit, as the backbench law passed last week would oblige him to do if he has not agreed a deal that can pass through parliament by 19 October. On Sunday, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was asked how the government intended to proceed. He appeared to suggest Downing Street would seek to find some way around the legislation. \u201cWe will adhere to the law but also this is such a bad piece of legislation \u2026 we will also want to test to the limit what it does actually lawfully require.

A Downing Street source said Johnson could seek to \u201csabotage\u201d any extension. \u201cThe \u2018surrender bill\u2019 only kicks in if an extension is offered. Once people realise our plans there is a good chance we won\u2019t be offered a delay.

The alliance will make a renewed bid to seize control of the parliamentary timetable on Monday, in the hope of forcing the government to publish its assessment of the risks of a no-deal Brexit. However, No 10 remains convinced that outside the Westminster bubble, voters will see Johnson as determinedly trying to deliver Brexit in the face of a cantankerous political establishment. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re suffering body blow after body blow in Westminster, but they\u2019re really resolute about the whole thing,\u201d said one senior Tory. Former justice secretary David Gauke warned last week that moderate voters would be repelled by what he called a \u201cFarage-lite\u201d approach. But another government insider said they had been reassured by Downing Street in recent days that private polling shows even voters in constituencies where moderate Conservative MPs have been chucked out of the party in recent days are being won over by the message of increased funds for the NHS and schools. In Dublin on Monday, Johnson will be under pressure to spell out more details of how his government intends to replace what he has called the \u201canti-democratic\u201d backstop for the Irish border. He has suggested an all-Ireland system of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks on agricultural products might provide part of the solution \u2013 but Varadkar has pointed out such issues only account for about 30% of border checks. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough on its own. We would need a single Irish economic zone, or whatever you would like to call it, to cover more than agriculture and food,\u201d Varadkar said on Friday. That approach would be anathema to the Democratic Unionist party. It was its members objection to border checks in the Irish Sea that helped push Theresa May towards reworking the backstop to cover the UK as a whole. Varadkar and his deputy, Simon Coveney, have spent the last two days stressing the backstop is about normal life on the border, as well as trade in agriculture and other goods. During a tour of no-deal inspection posts at Dublin\u2019s docks on Sunday, Varadkar said he did not expect a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d tomorrow at his first face-to-face meeting with Johnson but all efforts would remain focussed on a deal. He added that \u201cthe stakes are high\u201d. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, warned the government against going back on the detailed commitments May made in the 2017 December agreement to protect the integrity of the Good Friday agreement. He said: \u201cOver recent weeks, there have been disturbing briefings coming out of government about its intention to backtrack on the solemn commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago. \u201cThose commitments were the foundation of an agreement with the EU that would protect the peace process and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.

They have been preparing for this since 2015. They managed their fast bowlers with the Ashes in mind and used a Duke ball in Sheffield Shield cricket. England, for richer or poorer, prioritised the white Kookaburra ball.</p>\n    <p><b>2) Missing Jimmy</b></p>\n    <p>Anderson bowled only four overs at Edgbaston before a calf injury ruled him out of the series. In English conditions, that was actually a calculable loss \u2013 his last 100 wickets in home Tests have come at an average of 16. He loves beating Australia, and he might even have dragged Steve Smith\u2019s series average into double figures.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>3) Supersub crucial</b></p>\n    <p>No right-thinking person would argue with the introduction of concussion substitutes but the timing of that law change, the first day of the series, was crucial. The first concussion sub, Marnus Labuschagne, survived 100 balls on the tense final day at Lord\u2019s. Without him, England would probably have won the second Test.</p>\n    <p><b>4) No-ball calamity</b></p>\n    <p>A spinner taking a wicket with a no-ball is usually described as a cardinal sin. When the batsman is Steve Smith, it really is deadly. Smith was on 118 in the fourth Test when Leach had him caught off a no-ball; a wicket then would have left Australia 273 for six. Instead Australia added a further 224 runs to take control of the match.</p>\n    <p><b>5) Cummins and goings</b></p>\n    <p>When Pat Cummins ripped out Rory Burns and Joe Root went in the first over of England\u2019s second innings, it felt like a symbolic statement of Australia\u2019s superiority. Burns and Root batted for more than 50 overs on the third day; had England started the final day with 10 wickets intact, they might well have saved the game.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On the impact of white-ball cricket on his bid to shape a Test side generally, he added: \u201cWe are in the position we are and we have to make the most of that.

      "bodyText": "Joe Root vowed to plough on as England\u2019s Test captain as he processed the raw emotion of seeing his side\u2019s bid to regain the Ashes evaporate with the 185-run defeat in Manchester. Root, 28, has overseen an Ashes defeat away from home in 2017-18 and can only hope to level the current series come Thursday\u2019s fifth Test at the Oval after a defiant rearguard action that ultimately proved in vain. For a player who has seen his returns with the bat drop off this summer amid the strains of leadership \u2013 the right-hander has averaged 30 so far in this series and recorded three ducks \u2013 the temptation could be to drop back into the ranks and focus on his own game. Root, however, was defiant. Asked if he still wanted the job he has held since taking over from Alastair Cook in early 2017, Root replied: \u201cDefinitely, yeah. Whenever you lose, it hurts. I have to take that on the chin. You have to look at areas you want to get better at, both in yourself and as a team. \u201cIt is still very raw. [But] I have to look at next week.

Doubts over whether Ben Stokes can bowl following the shoulder injury suffered on the third day at Old Trafford may well mean he plays as a specialist batsman. If so he may move up to No 4 with another all-rounder \u2013 either Sam Curran or Chris Woakes \u2013brought in to share the workload. England\u2019s failure to recapture the Ashes will doubtless raise questions over a four-year focus on one-day cricket \u2013 one that led to this summer\u2019s World Cup triumph \u2013 but Root was having none of it, pointing to Steve Smith\u2019s remarkable return to the Test fold as the deciding factor. Asked if England\u2019s World Cup exertions affected the Test side, Root added: \u201cNo, I think that\u2019s an excuse. You turn up to an Ashes series and put everything you can into it.

Leach got one from Marnus Labuschagne that leapt. Overton was rapped on the pad by Josh Hazlewood.

They have been preparing for this since 2015. They managed their fast bowlers with the Ashes in mind and used a Duke ball in Sheffield Shield cricket. England, for richer or poorer, prioritised the white Kookaburra ball.</p>\n    <p><b>2) Missing Jimmy</b></p>\n    <p>Anderson bowled only four overs at Edgbaston before a calf injury ruled him out of the series. In English conditions, that was actually a calculable loss \u2013 his last 100 wickets in home Tests have come at an average of 16. He loves beating Australia, and he might even have dragged Steve Smith\u2019s series average into double figures.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>3) Supersub crucial</b></p>\n    <p>No right-thinking person would argue with the introduction of concussion substitutes but the timing of that law change, the first day of the series, was crucial. The first concussion sub, Marnus Labuschagne, survived 100 balls on the tense final day at Lord\u2019s. Without him, England would probably have won the second Test.</p>\n    <p><b>4) No-ball calamity</b></p>\n    <p>A spinner taking a wicket with a no-ball is usually described as a cardinal sin. When the batsman is Steve Smith, it really is deadly. Smith was on 118 in the fourth Test when Leach had him caught off a no-ball; a wicket then would have left Australia 273 for six. Instead Australia added a further 224 runs to take control of the match.</p>\n    <p><b>5) Cummins and goings</b></p>\n    <p>When Pat Cummins ripped out Rory Burns and Joe Root went in the first over of England\u2019s second innings, it felt like a symbolic statement of Australia\u2019s superiority. Burns and Root batted for more than 50 overs on the third day; had England started the final day with 10 wickets intact, they might well have saved the game.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "As you were then, the Urn. After the miracle of Headingley and the miracle of Lord\u2019s, England found their miracle jar empty of all but a few late crumbs at Old Trafford. Instead, on a brisk, grey-green autumn day Australia successfully retained the Ashes by confirming what has been clear ever since the middle of the first Test at Edgbaston. Tim Paine\u2019s tourists are simply a more settled, more potent Test team, to a degree that miraculous individual performances can only disguise for so long. There will now be a temptation to dwell on England failing to regain the Ashes; but in reality this has been an active feat. Australia have retained them, and done so by asserting some obvious strengths. To the credit of England\u2019s batting lineup the final day was much more than the wake most had expected. Indeed it almost became a resurrection as the overs remaining ticked down past 30 with two wickets still to fall, as the air began to thicken and crackle, taking on that strange, animate fifth-day quality. At times the entire kop end of the temporary stand writhed and bounced and waved its arms, taunting the approaching defeat. Jack Leach\u2019s appearance at the departure of Jofra Archer had been greeted like a triumph, a bonus, a masterstroke. Leach did his best. The twiddle, the hop, the neat little crouch. As the balls went by it was almost showy. At the other end Craig Overton seemed to have become something impregnable, 6ft 5in of impassible willow. At which point, enter the cold, hard reality of a disintegrating pitch and a hard ball. Leach got one from Marnus Labuschagne that leapt. Overton was rapped on the pad by Josh Hazlewood. As the review confirmed the match had been won the Aussie huddle began to dance and leap and dissolve into a series of heartfelt embraces. And sporting justice was served here. All credit to the victors. Steve Smith has been busy producing his own summer of historical ascent, his own moon landing, his Woodstock. His performances will be talked about as long as people still care about Test cricket. At Old Trafford Pat Cummins was again a marvel of sustained, high-pace craft, not to mention an Australian cricketer with the easy cinematic charm of a 1950s American matinee idol auditioning for the role of the world\u2019s most handsome astronaut.

Although there is a case to recalibrate just how intimidating the sight of 200 beer-sodden middle-aged men in emu suits really is, and to what degree this actually constitutes a \u201cfortress\u201d. In the end the nation with the best pace attack in the world, the best finger spinner outside India and the double insurance of Him at No 4 has just been too strong for a Test team with one fit bowler in the ICC top 25 (Australia have four).

      "bodyText": "After days of agonising over her political future, Amber Rudd knew she would resign as a cabinet minister and a member of the Conservative party on Wednesday night. Despite her efforts, she had been informed that Boris Johnson had ruled out reinstating 21 senior Tory MPs including Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond who had been kicked out of the party. It was a decisive blow to the work and pensions secretary and the beginning of the end of her short tenure as the most prominent member of the One Nation group in the Johnson government. According to an aide, Rudd had believed Johnson\u2019s assurances that he wanted to heal party divisions when he invited her to take the post just weeks earlier. Instead, Tory MPs who had voted for parliament to take control of the order paper had not only had the whip withdrawn on Tuesday, they were now being forced out of the party itself. It appears that when she learned that MPs, including Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson Sir Nicholas Soames, would not be invited to return, she realised there was no turning back. \u201cSince the PM had announced that he was proroguing parliament, she had been considering her position. When she discovered the PM was thinking about withdrawing the whip, she spoke to his team and urged them not to do this. \u201cThen she found out they were doing it anyway, and had dismissed her requests to reconsider. That was the moment that she knew she had to go,\u201d one aide said. Doubts had crystallised on Tuesday morning at a cabinet office meeting where Johnson invited a dozen of the Tory rebels in the hope of winning them over. Rudd, a former home secretary who resigned over the Windrush scandal, lost patience with Johnson as he failed to explain how he might get a deal with the EU and avoid a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any evidence of no-deal planning and that\u2019s what the people who came into that room really wanted to hear,\u201d Rudd told the Sunday Times. \u201cThey needed to hear more than \u2018trust me, I\u2019ve got this\u2019. They needed to hear what the proposals are, what the plans are, who the team are, who\u2019s on it. There was no attempt to have a strategy that would reassure colleagues.\u201d She discussed the possibility of stepping down with very few colleagues or family members, aides said. Her two closest confidantes \u2013 her special adviser Jason Stein and chief of staff at the department for work and pensions Eleanor Shawcross Wolfson \u2013 knew of her plans. That day, Rudd decided she would resign in an interview with the Conservative-leaning Sunday Times, aides said \u2013 a decision which Brexiters claim proves that she wanted to inflict maximum damage upon the Johnson government. The following day, she received a call from Jo Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s brother, who told her of his own plans to resign, a few minutes before he announced it on Twitter. \u201cShe was very surprised that he of all the doubters was going to go. She had thought that blood would be thicker than water,\u201d an aide said. Rudd was interviewed by the Sunday Times at her home and drew up a statement to be released on Saturday night. Her final conversation with the prime minister took place on Saturday evening, when she called him 10 minutes before the story was due to be launched online. An agitated Johnson pleaded with her to reconsider, but she let him know that she had already given a statement to the media. \u201cThe PM wanted to know why she hadn\u2019t told him first. But it is obvious why and she told him: \u2018Boris, you have some pretty brutal advisers\u2019,\u201d a Rudd aide said. It has also been pointed out that Johnson had given very little notice to Theresa May when he resigned himself as foreign secretary. Since tendering her resignation, Rudd has been approached by three cabinet ministers and nine junior ministers who have expressed concern at the direction of the government, friends said. Rudd has indicated that she would not be surprised if there were further resignations. Aides close to Downing Street have claimed that Rudd\u2019s decision to resign may have been motivated in part by concerns that she will be criticised in the long-awaited Wendy Williams report into the Windrush scandal. Friends of Rudd rebutted this claim saying they had already been told the report would instead heap blame upon the former prime minister May. \u201cHome office advisers have already been clear that they plan to blame Windrush on Theresa May using favoured journalists at the Daily Mail,\u201d a friend of Rudd claimed. Rudd said she will stand down from her seat in Hastings and Rye, where she has a majority of just 346, at the next election but will now consider whether to stand as an independent Conservative elsewhere.",

      "bodyText": "Australian internet service providers have been ordered to block eight websites hosting video of the Christchurch terrorist attacks. In March, shortly after the Christchurch massacre, Australian telecommunications companies and internet providers began proactively blocking websites hosting the video of the Christchurch shooter murdering more than 50 people or the shooter\u2019s manifesto. A total of 43 websites based on a list provided by Vodafone New Zealand were blocked. The government praised the internet providers despite the action being in a legally grey area by blocking the sites from access in Australia for people not using virtual private networks (VPNs) or other workarounds. To avoid legal complications the prime minister, Scott Morrison, asked the e-safety commissioner and the internet providers to develop a protocol for the e-safety commissioner to order the websites to block access to the offending sites. The order issued on Sunday covers just eight websites, after several stopped hosting the material, or ceased operating, such as 8chan. The order means the e-safety commissioner will be responsible for monitoring the sites. If they remove the material they can be unblocked. The blocks will be reviewed every six months. \u201cThe remaining rogue websites need only to remove the illegal content to have the block against them lifted,\u201d the e-safety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump says he has cancelled secret peace talks on Afghanistan scheduled for Sunday that would have brought him face to face with Taliban leaders at Camp David, the presidential retreat in the hills of Maryland state \u2013 with the Islamist militant group warning on Sunday that the snub meant more American lives would be lost. The US president made the remarkable claim in a series of tweets on Saturday evening declaring he had \u201ccalled off\u201d the negotiations after the Taliban claimed responsibility for a blast in Kabul that killed 12 people including a US soldier on Thursday. \u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d Trump wrote, accusing Taliban leaders of trying to build leverage ahead of Sunday\u2019s talks. \u201cIf they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway.\u201d The revelation of the planned talks and their abrupt cancellation leave a question mark over the future of peace talks intended to bring American involvement in Afghanistan to an end, an early and regularly recited Trump campaign pledge. The Taliban warned on Sunday that the cancellation meant more American lives would be lost, while the United States promised to keep up military pressure on the militants. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, criticized Trump for calling off the dialogue and said US forces have been pounding Afghanistan with attacks at the same time. \u201cThis will lead to more losses to the US,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIts credibility will be affected, its anti-peace stance will be exposed to the world, losses to lives and assets will increase.\u201d The secret plans by Trump emphasised how much faith the US president puts on personal diplomacy, even with people previous heads of state would have avoided meeting for fear of granting them imprimatur \u2013 now apparently including members of a militant group the US government officially classifies as terrorists. The Taliban had confirmed in a statement that it had been asked in late August by Trump to visit the US. \u201cWhile America and Afghan allies have killed hundreds of Afghans, it doesn\u2019t show patience and experience to react to an attack [by the Taliban] prior to signing the deal.\u201d The militant group vowed to continue its jihad but left open the possibility of resuming negotiations. \u201cIf the way if talks is chosen instead of war, we are committed to that until the end,\u201d it said. Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban\u2019s political office in Doha, where negotiations have been taking place, said an agreement had been \u201cfinalised\u201d a few days ago and that both sides agreed the deal would be announced by the Qatari government. \u201cEveryone was satisfied,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cAt this time, the disappointing President Trump\u2019s tweets have been unbelievable and certainly damaged his credibility.\u201d The Illinois congressman Adam Kinzinger, a fellow Republican, wrote on Twitter: \u201cNever should leaders of a terrorist organisation that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop.\u201d American negotiators said they had reached an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d with Taliban leaders over nine rounds of talks in Qatar aimed at facilitating the withdrawal of the roughly 13,000 US troops who remain in Afghanistan nearly 18 years since the military campaign commenced. The Camp David talks would have been held three days short of the anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks by al-Qaida militants who were being harboured in Afghanistan by the then ruling Taliban regime, the justification for the US-led invasion of the country a few weeks later. Most of the terms of the provisional peace agreement are classified but it would include the withdrawal of 5,000 American soldiers from five bases across Afghanistan by early next year. The Taliban would agree to renounce al-Qaida, fight the Islamic State group and stop jihadists from using the south Asian country as a safe haven. The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that talks could be reopened with a \u201ca significant commitment\u201d from the Taliban. \ufeffBloodletting has continued in the battered country despite the negotiations, including a car bomb blast on Thursday a fortified area near the green zone. The death of the American soldier was at least the 16th of a US serviceperson in Afghanistan this year. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. More than 1,200 civilians have been killed so far this year in the country, most as a result of airstrikes by US warplanes including 89 children, according to figures by the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan that the US government disputes. The withdrawal agreement has been criticised by Afghanistan\u2019s internationally recognised president, Ashraf Ghani, whose government was excluded from the talks as a condition of the Taliban sitting down at the table. \u201cThe government considers the Taliban\u2019s obstinacy to increase violence against Afghans as the main obstacle to the ongoing peace negotiations,\u201d said a spokesman for Ghani on Sunday. Activists have also said a US withdrawal would have dire implications for ordinary Afghans, especially women, who might be subject to extreme religious restrictions in a future Taliban-run or dominated national government. \u2022 Akhtar Mohammad Makoii contributed to this report from Herat and Reuters also contributed",

      "bodyText": "The government of the Bahamas has sent 900 police and military personnel to the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama, hardest hit by Hurricane Dorian, while taking action to stave off any profiteering by private-sector rescue missions amid signs of chaos in some of the aid operations. The destruction caused by the hurricane was still unfolding, a week after it landed in the northern reaches of the Bahamas as a category 5 storm. The government has said at least 43 people have died, but authorities are still trying to reach some areas that were cut off by flooding and debris. There are reports of several thousand people still missing and also of acute health, hygiene and security concerns fast developing in the Bahamas\u2019 northern islands. The Bahamian government said 120 Jamaican security personnel arrived on Saturday evening and 100 troops from Trinidad and Tobago were to arrive on Sunday as part of the aid effort. \u201cLarge numbers of security forces\u201d from Britain and the United States are involved in search, rescue and recovery operations, authorities said. About 250 people who lost their homes in the storm arrived in the Bahamian capital Nassau on Saturday after a 13-hour trip on a government-chartered ferry, joining hundreds of other people from the Abaco and Grand Bahama islands who were desperate to escape harsh conditions there. Carlen Merizier, 23, said she and her two-year-old son were lucky to be alive. She said \u201ca lot of people died\u201d and that she started praying when her home collapsed in the hurricane. Other survivors, some with no more than the clothes they left in, also arrived in Florida at the weekend on a cruise ship that went to the islands\u2019 assistance. Meanwhile, emergency officials in the Bahamas said they have had to \u201cclamp down\u201d on aircraft demanding payment for evacuating displaced people from some of the areas devastated by Hurricane Dorian. The Bahamian government\u2019s National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) said aviation authorities are aware of reports of \u201ccommercial activity\u201d and would revoke flight permission for any aircraft charging fees. The agency said in a statement on Sunday that no flights are permitted to bill the authorities for evacuations and that consumer protection officials are investigating \u201cincidences of price-gouging\u201d. A website started by a member of the public in the Bahamas for people unofficially to log missing persons has at least 6,500 names on it and, as of Sunday afternoon, while many have the status \u201cknown\u201d recorded next to the name, more names have \u201cunknown\u201d written next to them. Civil aviation authorities said they were restricting air space over the Abaco islands and Grand Bahama to prevent accidents and ensure only approved aircraft that are providing aid can fly there. Officials have authorized 200 private planes in the area and say \u201csaturated airspace was creating a volatile situation\u201d. Phillip Smith, the executive director of the Bahamas Feeding Network, a non-profit organisation, was organising the delivery of 20,000 meals to those most in need in Freeport, on Grand Bahama. \u201cJust going into the communities here is tough. Seeing kids who haven\u2019t had a drink of water in quite a while, it\u2019s a confronting thing,\u201d he said. There are fears that patchy remaining water supplies in the damaged areas will be contaminated and survivors are at risk from disease, also with dead bodies yet to be recovered.

On 15 August a court in Gibraltar released it when Iran gave assurances it would not sail to Syria, despite pressure from the US for the ship\u2019s continued detainment.</p> <p>The US Department of Justice issued a warrant for the seizure of the ship, and the US Department of State has confirmed that US officials subsequently offered the ship\u2019s Indian captain millions to take the ship\u2019s oil to a port where the oil \u2013 worth as much as as \u00a3110m \u2013 could be impounded by the US. After the captain gave no positive response, he and the ship were put under US sanctions.</p> <p>Since leaving Gibraltar the ship had taken a peripatetic route towards Syria, but was last photographed off the Russian navy port of Tartus in Syria. TankerTrackers, a firm that monitors oil tankers, has seen no evidence that its 2.1m barrels of oil have been discharged.</p> <p>\u201cWe will continue to put pressure on Iran and as President Trump said, there will be no waivers of any kind for Iran\u2019s oil,\u201d US Treasury official Sigal Mandelker told Reuters on Sunday.</p> <p>The UK argued that an EU embargo on oil sales to Syria entitled the UK to impound the tanker once it entered British waters. Iran says it is not subject to the EU sanctions regime.</p> <p>In apparent retaliation for the seizure of the tanker, the Iranians seized the British-flagged vessel Stena Impero in the strait of Hormuz. On Sunday the Iranian foreign ministry said that ship would be released soon, adding that preparations for the ship\u2019s release were at their last stages. Last week it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/iran-gives-europe-two-months-to-save-nuclear-deal\">released seven of the ship\u2019s crew</a>. Sixteen of the crew, none of whom were British, remained on board, and Stena Bulk, the owner of Stena Impero, said last week it was working tirelessly to secure their release, adding there was no evidence the ship had breached any maritime regulations.</p> <p>It is not clear if the UK would have any powers if indeed the Iranian oil has been sold to Syria, but the episode will hardly do much to rebuild shattered trust between Tehran and London, and will be used by Washington hawks to argue Iran\u2019s word cannot be taken at face value.</p> <p>John Bolton, the US national security advisor, tweeted last week that anyone who thought the oil was not bound for Syria was in denial.</p> <p>Privately, some British diplomats admit it was a mistake to succumb to US pressure to capture Grace 1, given the high stakes wider negotiations between Europe and Iran aimed at trying to keep Iran inside the 2015 nuclear deal.</p> <p>Tehran on Saturday detailed its third planned set of steps to reduce its obligations under the deal, saying it could not stay inside the deal unilaterally. It said it had begun injecting uranium gas into advanced centrifuges and that the country will no longer abide by the deal\u2019s limits on its nuclear research and developments.</p> <p>A French plan for a $15bn credit line to help the Iranians sell their oil appears to have foundered because of US objections to reintroducing oil export waivers, a precondition for the plan gaining traction. The credit line was seen as a way to start talks between Washington and Tehran on a reworked nuclear deal.</p>",

On 15 August a court in Gibraltar released it when Iran gave assurances it would not sail to Syria, despite pressure from the US for the ship\u2019s continued detainment. The US Department of Justice issued a warrant for the seizure of the ship, and the US Department of State has confirmed that US officials subsequently offered the ship\u2019s Indian captain millions to take the ship\u2019s oil to a port where the oil \u2013 worth as much as as \u00a3110m \u2013 could be impounded by the US. After the captain gave no positive response, he and the ship were put under US sanctions. Since leaving Gibraltar the ship had taken a peripatetic route towards Syria, but was last photographed off the Russian navy port of Tartus in Syria. TankerTrackers, a firm that monitors oil tankers, has seen no evidence that its 2.1m barrels of oil have been discharged. \u201cWe will continue to put pressure on Iran and as President Trump said, there will be no waivers of any kind for Iran\u2019s oil,\u201d US Treasury official Sigal Mandelker told Reuters on Sunday. The UK argued that an EU embargo on oil sales to Syria entitled the UK to impound the tanker once it entered British waters. Iran says it is not subject to the EU sanctions regime. In apparent retaliation for the seizure of the tanker, the Iranians seized the British-flagged vessel Stena Impero in the strait of Hormuz. On Sunday the Iranian foreign ministry said that ship would be released soon, adding that preparations for the ship\u2019s release were at their last stages. Last week it released seven of the ship\u2019s crew. Sixteen of the crew, none of whom were British, remained on board, and Stena Bulk, the owner of Stena Impero, said last week it was working tirelessly to secure their release, adding there was no evidence the ship had breached any maritime regulations. It is not clear if the UK would have any powers if indeed the Iranian oil has been sold to Syria, but the episode will hardly do much to rebuild shattered trust between Tehran and London, and will be used by Washington hawks to argue Iran\u2019s word cannot be taken at face value. John Bolton, the US national security advisor, tweeted last week that anyone who thought the oil was not bound for Syria was in denial. Privately, some British diplomats admit it was a mistake to succumb to US pressure to capture Grace 1, given the high stakes wider negotiations between Europe and Iran aimed at trying to keep Iran inside the 2015 nuclear deal. Tehran on Saturday detailed its third planned set of steps to reduce its obligations under the deal, saying it could not stay inside the deal unilaterally. It said it had begun injecting uranium gas into advanced centrifuges and that the country will no longer abide by the deal\u2019s limits on its nuclear research and developments. A French plan for a $15bn credit line to help the Iranians sell their oil appears to have foundered because of US objections to reintroducing oil export waivers, a precondition for the plan gaining traction. The credit line was seen as a way to start talks between Washington and Tehran on a reworked nuclear deal.",

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has pledged that after almost a decade of being dependent on international rescue funds, his debt-stricken country will soon prove to be a \u201cpleasant surprise for Europe\u201d. With investor confidence in Greek bonds better than at any time in the past 10 years, Mitsotakis said the country long at the forefront of the euro crisis had finally turned the corner. \u201cGreece is no longer Europe\u2019s black sheep,\u201d he told the Thessaloniki trade fair, where Greek leaders traditionally outline economic policy. \u201cIt is a country with self-confidence now,\u201d he added in the keynote speech on Saturday. Addressing Greece\u2019s business elite two months after his centre-right New Democracy party ousted the leftist Syriza on a platform to revamp the economy, Mitsotakis said implementation of fast-track reforms to modernise the state and cut red tape were a priority if the EU member was to regain political credibility. Only then could it appeal for leniency in relaxing the stringent fiscal targets the previous administration had agreed to achieve as part of Athens\u2019s third bailout in 2015. Under the former prime minister Alexis Tsipras Greece committed to meet the ambitious primary budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP \u2013 before debt repayments \u2013 this year and next. \u201cWith a bold wave of reforms we will win strong credibility and with the right timing and our positive results as a weapon, we will claim more realistic, annual primary budget surpluses,\u201d Mitsotakis said, using the occasion to announce an array of corporate and individual tax cuts. The former banker has already moved fast to reduce a much-loathed property tax known as Enfia by a fifth. Previously he had kept the bar low in terms of promising relief to a population forced to endure draconian austerity in return for rescue funds. On Sunday, at a press conference following the policy address, he defended the cuts saying the pro-business government would also prioritise foreign investment to produce new wealth and boost unemployment. Chief among them would be the redevelopment of the prime coastal spot that once housed Athens\u2019s abandoned Hellinikon airport, a project that stalled under Syriza but now projected to generate as many as 30,000 jobs and seen as key to turning the economy around. Tsipras hit back, accusing his rival of making irresponsible promises given Greece\u2019s tight fiscal limits. \u201cHe will soon find himself faced with the dead ends and inconsistencies of his policies,\u201d said Tsipras, who oversaw the country\u2019s return to stability after reversing his combative approach and anti-austerity rhetoric and signing up to the tough terms of a third bailout that would keep Greece in the eurozone. The country took stock of more than \u20ac300bn (\u00a3271bn) in rescue funds between 2010 and 2015 \u2013 the largest bailout of any advanced western economy in financial history.

A Mike Brearley figure, if you will. I always thought it a bit of a shame that at least one of the 1990\u2019s stalwarts, say Atherton, Stewart, Thorpe, Gough or McCague, who had endured so much suffering at the hands of the Aussies, did not get one last shot at redemption.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Yes, I know what you mean.

Around 600 runs at an average of over 60 (25 more than the next best English batsman, KP.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMore than that, much like Smith, he just looked so much better than any other batsman on either side. On more typically English pitches, if memory serves correctly. Without his runs, England\u2019s superior all round attack (for English conditions) would not have had enough runs to win. Anyway, all this got me thinking what we\u2019d give for even late-career, eyes gone, averaging only a tick over 40, coming in at 5 or 6, IRB in this England side.

Then he was made captain, in which capacity he is no more than competent.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s the general impression, but it\u2019s not quite right. His ratio of hundreds per match is about the same with or without the captaincy. I\u2019d guess that his conversion rate got noticed a lot more as the leader who is supposed to make the defining score rather than the up and coming player who is a talent for the future.</p> \n  <p>His conversion issue is marked though: 59 scores over 50, and only 16 hundreds.</p> \n  <p>Compare that to Smith: 52 scores over 50, 26 hundreds. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d74d7808f083106f4557874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-08T10:30:40.658Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>13th over: England 25-2 (Denly 11, Roy 14) </strong>Good grief, Pat Cummins is bowling a gorgeous spell.

Another draws a thick miscued inside edge away for a single, Roy jolting forward at it, bending double. This is survival batting at the moment, Roy doesn\u2019t look like a player with the tools to cope. He just has to find a way through, no matter how it looks, and hope that things get easier.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d74d61f8f082514879f010e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-08T10:22:39.346Z\">11.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>12th over: England 24-2 (Denly 11, Roy 13)</strong> Now it\u2019s Roy\u2019s turn to be hit on the pad, with Hazlewood bowling.

Archer\u2019s trajectory was incendiary but like all fireworks they sometimes splutter and fizz. Australia\u2019s attack is three world class quicks. Smith is freaky but, I still think it\u2019s a team effort this series and down to one individual alone. Not a lot of point having a V12 Lambo with out a gearbox or wheels is there.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The bowling attack is definitely excellent. It\u2019s more a case that Australia\u2019s batting outside Smith was so poor that there was zero chance of giving those bowlers enough room to win a Test had Smith not been there.

The touring attack now has more control over England\u2019s destiny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/08/brexit-boris-johnson-amber-rudd-resignation-live-news\">than the minority government</a>. </p> \n  <p>After a lacklustre start to this Test England showed flashes of ticker on day three but it still wasn\u2019t enough to remove Steve Smith cheaply, nor repel Pat Cummins late in the day when the world\u2019s best bowler showed just why he sits on top of the ICC rankings. His dismissal of Joe Root for a golden duck may well be remembered as fondly as that of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue0ghB6Z_C4\">Simon Jones bamboozling Michael Clarke</a> back in 2005, one of those occasions where the greatness of the delivery, the stature of the batsman, and the timing within the series, all coalesced to form one perfect moment. </p> \n  <p>Of course, Ben Stokes could yet make it three miracles in one summer and compel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/12/psychic-claims-james-randi-paranormal\">even James Randi </a>to question the presence of a supernatural being. Such an intervention cannot be discounted, but the brittleness of England\u2019s batting order means even if Stokes does do something absurd again the Englishmen at the other end of the pitch still have to survive a day totalling 98 overs against a relentless, skilful attack. </p> \n  <p>If you want to be a part of history - one way or the other - you can reach me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">Twitter</a> or feel free to <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">send me an email</a>.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "That is worrying ... Steve Smith was the difference ... Root reacts ... Barney Ronay on England and what they lack. And that is the end of that chapter. Thanks for joining everyone that was involved today. Here is the match report. Sky are now just going through the wickets again, which is pretty painful. My brother was at Old Trafford today and they ran out of John Smith\u2019s, which is a shame. Luckily he only drinks Pimms. Is Ollie Pope the next cab off the rank? Does Dom Sibley merit a go as he has actually scored some runs this season? After that, the options are not great. Liam Livingstone, maybe? Hussain points out that Roy opening was a poor decision on the selectors\u2019 part. Now he is questioning the dropping of Woakes for this Test. He has not had a great series but his stats in England are incredible. He is averaging 22.78 with the ball. Beefy and Ponting also say it\u2019s rather silly to leave Woakes out. Who will replace Roy in the next game? Botham slags off the Kookaburra ball, adding how much better Dukes balls are. So there is one victory for England. Phil Town says: \u201cIt has to do with talent, sure, but also hunger. Who was hungrier? Who wanted this more?\u201d Plenty of England players seem to have eaten plenty, it would seem. Langer revealed in his chat that he sat the team down to watch the final stages of the loss at Headingley. Some might have viewed it from behind the sofa but maybe it was quite a cathartic experience. Will England watch back some of their dreadful shots throughout the series? John Shercliff emails in: \u201cWho cares?\u201d Thanks for your contribution, John. Justin Langer speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievable series and it\u2019s great for Test cricket. \u201cHe\u2019s [Paine] fantastic, isn\u2019t he? He is the best wicketkeeper in the world in my opinion. He is a really good leader. \u201cWe have the No 1 fast bowler in the world and the No 1 batsman in the world. I thought Virat Kohli was the best batsman I\u2019ve ever seen but I think Steve Smith is another level. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been great at winning away for some time, so winning away from home with such a way from home is really important for this group. \u201cThis has been the most challenging week of my coaching career and now the most rewarding.\u201d Langer is now off for a beer. Needless to say, Steve Smith win\u2019s Man of the Match. People still booing him! \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy sitting and watching last week, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Smith says. \u201cTo know that the urn is coming home is an incredibly special feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good series, I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time in the middle, I\u2019ve worked very hard. I want to be the man in the middle doing the best for my team. I don\u2019t like watching cricket, so I\u2019d rather be out there in the middle. \u201cI\u2019ve got two hundreds in two games at The Oval, so it\u2019s a place I do like batting. We didn\u2019t come here to just retain the Ashes, we came here to win it.\u201d Tim Paine: \u201cI am pretty pumped. This team has been through a lot in the last 12 to 18 months, some individuals more than others. \u201cI was really proud how our bowlers stuck at it. We were trying to stay calm, but it\u2019s not always easy in that situation. I am really pumped for the boys to get it won. \u201cHe [Smith] is pretty handy. He is the best player I have ever seen. \u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy tonight but we came here to win the series not just retain the Ashes.\u201d It\u2019s the presentations ... A rather emotional Joe Root: \u201cI thought we show greater fight and belief in what we wanted to achieve. \u201cWe always believe and make sure we fight to the end. \u201cYou can always sit back and look back at different areas of how you could do things differently. \u201cEveryone stood up and played bravely. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some wonderful test cricket this series and I expect the same at The Oval. It\u2019s tough to lose but we have to pick ourselves up and get ready for The Oval.\u201d We are having a lovely montage to remind us of some woeful England shots. At least we can hold on to the fact that the Australia openers are terrible, right? Paine has got a few things wrong over the series when it comes to his bowlers but bringing on Labuschagne was a certainly a critical decision he got right. He saw the conditions and backed his part-time leggie to get the job done and did so with a lovely ball into the footmarks. Gower is trying to find some positives ... mainly focusing on Denly getting a few more runs. I am not sure he is exactly the future and the rest of the batting lineup have plenty of questions to answer. Can Roy survive for another Test? Will Buttler be replaced? You cannot underestimate how important that first over was last night from Pat Cummins, as without those early wickets England might have had a chance. Josh Hazlewood says Australia will be going to win the series in the next Test, which is the sort of attitude required. Will they come up against a much changed England side? Marnus reacts: \u201cI was actually at the top of my mark and I said \u2018just trust it, spin it hard\u2019 and I got the length right. It bounced up and struck Leachy\u2019s gloves. \u201cI am getting chills even talking about it. It\u2019s not the way you want to get the opportunity, seeing Steve [Smith] going down but you have to take the opportunities when they come.\u201d As Rob said, Australia have been the better throughout the series and merited the victory. Steve Smith reacts to the victory: \u201cIt feels amazing to know the urn is coming home. \u201cIt\u2019s always been one to tick off the bucket list to take the urn back home from England. \u201cThey fought incredibly hard, I thought Overton was excellent at the end.\u201d There was a lovely moment as Australia watched the replay, waiting for confirmation that Overton was out. Steve Smith was hopping around nervously, of course he was. The rest were perfectly still \u2013 and then it was confirmed, and they all went ballistic. They deserve to celebrate exceptionally well tonight, and they will. England almost stole a draw, but it would have been a travesty. Australia have been much the better team in this series - they have an awesome, relentless bowling attack and a supernatural batsman, and they fully deserve their first retention of the Ashes since December 2002. I have to go and do newspaper stuff, so Will Unwin will talk you through the reaction. Thanks for your company and emails, and congratulations to Australia. Night! WICKET! England 197 all out (Overton LBW b Hazlewood 21) They\u2019ve done it! It was a lovely delivery from Hazlewood, a big nipbacker that hit Overton in front of middle stump. Height was the only thing that might have saved him - but it was hitting the top of the stumps. OVERTON IS GIVEN OUT LBW AND REVIEWS! I think this is out. It was a token review. 91st over: England 197-9 (Overton 21, Broad 0) Broad does survive the last two deliveries. Labuschagne, his work done, is going to be replaced by Josh Hazlewood. 90.4 overs: England 197-9 (Overton 21, Broad 0) Overton has been heroic in defence. But he now needs to find a way to farm the strike; he takes a single off the fourth ball of Lyon\u2019s over. 90th over: England 196-9 (Overton 20, Broad 0) The No11, Stuart Broad, has one ball to survive from Labuschagne. He should just run at the ball so it hits him outside the line. In fact it\u2019s a full toss, which Broad defends. The last hour begins, with 15 overs remaining. Brilliant captaincy from Tim Paine! Labuschagne got one to spit from the rough at Leach, who could only fence it to Wade at short leg. It was the bounce that did for him. He walks off looking desolate, having fought so hard for 51 balls. Now then: Marnus Labuschagne is coming on to bowl some legspin. That\u2019s not a bad idea, with the ball kicking out of the rough to the left-handed Leach. And the gamble has worked! 89th over: England 196-8 (Overton 20, Leach 12) Starc replaces Cummins, who gave everything in that short spell. Starc is the freshest of the Aussie bowlers, in the context of both the match and the series, and a specialist at blasting out tailenders. Overton is better than that, a good No8 at Test level, and he calmly survives another six deliveries. It\u2019s been a heroic innings of 20 not out from 98 balls. There are 16 overs remaining, light permitting. 88th over: England 196-8 (Overton 20, Leach 12) Lyon beats Leach with a textbook, flighted off-break. Gorgeous bowling. Leach is beaten again, trying to cut the last ball - a rare poor stroke is a fine defensive innings. Another maiden. (Ignore the change in score, I missed a run somewhere.) 87th over: England 195-8 (Overton 20, Leach 12) A short ball from Cummins hits Overton on the arm. That gives the physio the chance to walk down the steps. \u201cEasy does it on those stairs - health and safety,\u201d says Nasser Hussain on commentary. Overton actually tells the physio to stay by the boundary edge. We must be due a drinks break soon as well. It\u2019s getting very heated, and not just on Jack Leach\u2019s glasses. Cummins is ramming almost everything into the pitch now, prompting a few pantomime boos from the crowd. He beats Overton with a length delivery - but it\u2019s a no-ball, which is good for Australia. They get an extra delivery; more importantly it\u2019s a warning for Cummins to watch his front foot because they will check if he takes a wicket. Overton survives the remainder of the over - 18 to go, and there\u2019s a pulsating atmosphere at Old Trafford. \u201cYou can never stop,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cYou\u2019re our liveblog Sisyphus. Every time you roll the OBO up one side of the hill it just rolls down the other side...\u201d But, Niall, I\u2019m 94 years old. There\u2019s no cap on playing time, unless bad light stops play. Craig Overton has a change of bat, which takes up a minute or so. I suspect we\u2019ll get at least 12 of the remaining 19 overs, if necessary. But this might not take long, because Cummins has gone to a whole new level of nastiness. 86th over: England 195-8 (Overton 20, Leach 12) Lyon replaces Hazlewood, with six men round the bat. Leach survives a hopeful LBW appeal from a ball that straightened - but only after pitching outside leg stump. After that he defends solidly, and it\u2019s yet another maiden. Nineteen overs to go. \u201cThis is, of course simultaneously unbearable and brilliant,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cI can\u2019t take much more so I\u2019m going for a run with TMS on, one that was supposed to be calming me down after our inevitable pre-tea capitulation. We all know that it\u2019s still not going to happen but.... oh CRICKET.\u201d 85th over: England 195-8 (Overton 20, Leach 12) Tim Paine puts his around Cummins\u2019 shoulder, and asks him to extract blood from a stone one last time. The Aussie seamers look shattered, understandably given their relentless yakka. Cummins has decided to bomb Leach, who gloves a horrible bouncer to safety on the off side. That could have gone anywhere. Leach takes a break to clean his glasses. Marais Erasmus has a word, so Leach politely points out that dealing with 90mph bouncers tends to steam up your lenses. The physio runs on, hoping to waste a bit of time with a concussion test. Leach tells him he just needed to clean his glasses, and then jumps under a follow-up bouncer. Cummins follows up with a few hard-faced words, his eyes full of malevolence. This is terrific stuff. Leach was hit very badly by Morne Morkel last year, which affected him enormously until he got that 92 against Ireland. He\u2019s showing so much courage, not to mention clarity under such extreme pressure. Twenty overs remaining. 84th over: England 194-8 (Overton 20, Leach 11) CLEAN YOUR BLOODY GLASSES, LEACH! ACCIDENTALLY BREAK A LENS SO THAT YOU HAVE TO GET ANOTHER PAIR! SPECSAVERS DOESN\u2019T OPEN UNTIL 9AM MONDAY MORNING FFS!!! YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT, YOU\u2019RE AN UNOFFICIAL BLOODY AMBASSADOR FOR THEM! Hazlewood replaces Starc. Leach turns him off the pads for three. Moves into double figures. Staccato sentences hereon in. 21 overs left. Huge applause. Help. 83rd over: England 191-8 (Overton 20, Leach 8) Cummins beats Overton with a beautiful delivery in the corridor. That aside he\u2019s a fraction too wide, allowing Overton to leave a few deliveries. Yet another maiden. Whatever happens, England have fought admirably today. I suppose rearguards like this make their dozy, laissez-faire performances even more frustrating. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about cricket, and many of your updates seem to be in a foreign language,\u201d says Kirsty, \u201cbut I\u2019m sitting here in my flat in the South of France thoroughly enjoying the match (and cheering England on!), remembering childhood summers in Sussex with my dad watching cricket on TV with the sound off and the radio commentary on\u2026 I\u2019m supposed to be working, but reading the minute-by-minute is much more entertaining!\u201d It\u2019s just as much fun to write, especially during heart-stopping finishes like this, the Headingley Test and the World Cup final. I could do this every day! In an unrelated query, does anyone know of a vacancy for a fortysomething trainee barista? Doesn\u2019t have to be a salaried position. 82nd over: England 191-8 (Overton 20, Leach 8) Leach is beaten by a nasty lifter from Starc. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it from Mitchell Starc - get nasty,\u201d says Shane Warne, which is entirely inappropriate before the watershed. Leach, to huge cheers, turns Starc off the pads for four. It\u2019s getting slightly darker at Old Trafford, and the floodlight are on, but we\u2019re a long way from bad light stopping play. Leach cleans his glasses at the end of the over. Were he so inclined, that would be a great timewasting tactic. \u201cI woke up at 4am to the delightful sound of torrential rain,\u201d says David Farrelly. \u201cThen I realized I was in Utah and not at Old Trafford. The first rain for months here. Right time, wrong place.\u201d 81st over: England 186-8 (Overton 19, Leach 4) Pat Cummins returns, with the second new ball in his huge right hand. He needs one for his five-for and two for the match. If anyone deserves to take an Ashes-winning wicket, it\u2019s him. His first over is a bit of a loosener, which Leach defends reasonably comfortably - at least until the final delivery, which zips past the inside edge. Another maiden, the 25th of the innings. England have parked the bus. There have been 22 runs from the last 16 overs, and more than half of those have been edges for four. There are 24 overs/144 balls remaining. Realistically, we won\u2019t get all those. England need to survive another 80-90 minutes, at which point the light will became a factor. 80th over: England 186-8 (Overton 19, Leach 4) Starc goes around the wicket to Overton, a sure sign the ball is reversing. He has three slips, silly point, short leg and leg gully. Overton again uses his reach to defend, and gets a bonus boundary from a thick edge all along the floor. He\u2019s survived 74 deliveries in this innings, more than anyone except Denly and Buttler. The second new ball is available. 79th over: England 182-8 (Overton 15, Leach 4) Lyon changes ends to replace Hazlewood, who blew the bloody doors off with the wicket off Jos Buttler. Leach is surrounded by six fielders, plus Paine and the bowler Lyon; he softens his hands to play out a maiden. 78th over: England 182-8 (Overton 15, Leach 4) Back comes Mitchell Starc, the man who eats tailenders for his sport. Leach is beaten twice - but he survives, and does especially well to dig out a brilliant yorker off the last delivery. For some reason he also takes a single to keep the strike. Overton should be taking as much as possible. 77th over: England 181-8 (Overton 15, Leach 3) Overton does extremely well to survive some vicious inswingers from Hazlewood before taking a single off the fourth delivery. England can\u2019t survive another 28 overs of such relentless bowling, although Leach does cheer the crowd up by clipping off his pads for three. \u201cHi Rob, I\u2019m following the cricket from the balcony of a restaurant in Bucharest,\u201d says Steve Clowes. \u201cOn a giant screen, a football match is about to begin with Hagi starting for Romania against Malta. I\u2019m not trapped in the 1980s; it\u2019s the great one\u2019s son. I haven\u2019t spotted any budding Romanian spin bowlers yet.\u201d It was a monstrous inswinging yorker from Hazlewood to Overton, which hit something and flew to fine leg for four. The umpire thought it was inside edge - but replays suggest it wasn\u2019t! There was a scuff of bat on ground, not ball, and then it brushed the back pad before continuing past the leg stump. But the fact it hit the back pad and still missed leg stump meant that, you guessed it, it was going to miss leg stump anyway. It was some delivery though. Oh my goodness. I don\u2019t know where to start. Australia review for LBW! I have no idea whether this is out or not. 76th over: England 173-8 (Overton 14, Leach 0) Once more unto the Leach: everyone\u2019s favourite spectacle-wearer has been promoted to No10. His first defensive stroke prompts a huge cheer. Archer has been trapped by an unplayable grubber from Lyon. It was very similar to Nasser Hussain\u2019s comedy dismissal in the West Indies 21 years ago; a No9 batsman, even a useful one like Archer, had no chance. Australia are two wickets away from retaining the Ashes! You can\u2019t play those! 75th over: England 173-7 (Overton 14, Archer 1) Jofra Archer is the new batsman. He almost kicks the ball onto his stumps via the back of his standing foot. That was a brilliant delivery to Buttler from Hazlewood, which came back a fair way to hit the top of off stump. That\u2019s what he and Cummins have done all series. Buttler was set up beautifully there The field was set for the short ball, but Hazlewood sent down a lovely fullish inswinger. Buttler offered no stroke and then heard the miserable sound of his off stump being pegged back. Done him! 74th over: England 171-6 (Buttler 34, Overton 13) Overton shovels Lyon off the pads for a run, or a dot ball by another name. It\u2019s not going to rain, but light could become a factor if England take this past 6.30pm. This pair have now batted for 20 overs; I reckon they need to survive at least another 15 for England to have a realistic chance of some twilight robbery. 73rd over: England 170-6 (Buttler 34, Overton 12) We\u2019ve already had two heart-stoppers this summer. Surely we\u2019re not heading for a third. Buttler is beaten by a grotesque legcutter from Hazlewood. Sheesh, even Steve Smith wouldn\u2019t have nicked that. It\u2019s another maiden. We\u2019ve had six runs from the last eight overs, and nobody gives a fig. Four of those were off the edge as well. It\u2019s over-my-dead-bat stuff from Buttler and Overton. 72nd over: England 170-6 (Buttler 34, Overton 12) Overton\u2019s height is allowing him to get a long way forward to a number of Lyon\u2019s deliveries, killing any spin at source. The likeliest dismissal looks like a catch round the corner or at short leg from a slightly shorter delivery. For now, another maiden: 72 overs down, 33 to go. \u201cThis has been such a weird series,\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cOn the one hand Australia could win 3-1 and be very unlucky not to win 4-0. On the other, there\u2019s still a very small chance England could win the series, and could argue that but for Smith, a dropped catch at Lord\u2019s and their best bowler being injured after four overs in the first Test (meaning one Test being played with ten men effectively) they could have won the series comfortably. Swap Smith for Root, certainly, and there would have been no contest.\u201d Yes. It feels like a cross between the 2010-11 Ashes, when the away side\u2019s superiority eventually told, and England\u2019s steal against South Africa in 1998. I still think it\u2019ll end 3-1 Australia though, and that\u2019s probably the right result. 71st over: England 170-6 (Buttler 34, Overton 12) Hazlewood to Buttler, bowling very straight in an attempt to maximise any uneven bounce. Buttler defends, and defends some more. This has been comfortably his best innings since approximately 14 July 2019. He has a bit of fortune off the last delivery, though, thick edging along the ground for four. \u201cFourteen years since 2005, eh?\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI was 33 during that summer, so always think (in a parallel universe where I was an international-class cricketer) that I could have played in that England side, as one of the elder statesman, guiding the less experienced players to a famous victory. A Mike Brearley figure, if you will. I always thought it a bit of a shame that at least one of the 1990\u2019s stalwarts, say Atherton, Stewart, Thorpe, Gough or McCague, who had endured so much suffering at the hands of the Aussies, did not get one last shot at redemption.\u201d Yes, I know what you mean. Michael Vaughan would argue that\u2019s why they won, because they had no players with significant mental scarring. At least Gough played a part in setting the aggressive tone during the white-ball games. His growl at Andrew Symonds in the T20 game was especially funny. 70th over: England 166-6 (Buttler 30, Overton 12) Australia celebrate a non-wicket from the first ball after tea when Craig Overton chests Lyon to short leg. Kumar Dharmasena says not out, and Australia don\u2019t review. The next ball is pad-batted just past Head at silly point. \u201cHe\u2019s too close there!\u201d says Ricky Ponting on commentary. Overton is surrounded now: silly point, slip, short leg, leg slip, short midwicket. He survives the rest of the over: 35 to go. \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d says Damian Clarke. \u201cI feel Mr. Sawyer\u2019s pain. There was a thing called Band T-shirt Day a couple of years ago, where apparently one is allowed to wear said shirt to work. My only band t shirt was a uber cool Bunnymen one from my younger days, with Pope John Paul II wearing fluorescent pink rabbit ears. When I dug (and dug, and dug) it out, it looked like it would better fit my eight-year-old nephew than my current self.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it Steve Lamacq who introduced that idea? It\u2019s fine when you have his physique. Even though I work from home, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be digging out my Menswe@r number for next year\u2019s T-shirt Day. Here come the batsmen, to another ovation. If England pull this off, the place will go bananas. That opening over from Pat Cummins last night, which was awesome at the time, now looks even better. As does Steve Smith\u2019s extraordinary innings, in some ways his best of the series, which enabled Australia to declare earlier than expected. Once more unto the Leach, dear friends, once more...If England are to save this match, Jack Leach will surely have to do it again. Australia need four wickets; England need 216 balls, or some very bad light. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cCardiff \u201809 is the obvious precedent, but let\u2019s not forget Matt Prior\u2019s finest hour in Auckland.\u201d Quite. In some ways, that\u2019s my favourite OBO memory - stinking cold, up all night until about 6am, shaking like a leaf for most of the final session. That\u2019s my Radox. 69th over: England 166-6 (Buttler 30, Overton 12) Labuschagne replaces Starc and has a huge shout for LBW against Overton turned down by Marais Erasmus. Very close, this, and Paine is tempted... but he decides not to review. It was a lovely delivery, but there was a bit of doubt over height. Yes, Hawkeye shows it was bouncing over the stumps. That\u2019s tea. Buttler and Overton walk off to a lusty ovation. England are fighting so hard to keep the Ashes alive: Buttler has 30 from 96 balls, Overton 12 from 47. But there are still 216 balls remaining. 68th over: England 164-6 (Buttler 29, Overton 11) Lyon continues to rip the ball as much as possible, even though his spinning finger is clearly causing a lot of pain. Another maiden to the diligent Overton. One more over until tea. Unless... \u201cIs it too early,\u201d says Niall Mullen, \u201cto send the physio on?\u201d Haha. That\u2019s one of the funnier things I\u2019ve seen on a cricket field, especially as it turned out he was an Australian and Ponting was his hero. I believe that, among others, Ponting deployed the letters F and C. 67th over: England 164-6 (Buttler 29, Overton 11) There hasn\u2019t been much swing for Starc in this spell, which is a surprise given how much Cummins was making it talk. Buttler continues to play his unnatural game, leaving or defending almost everything. Another maiden. Well played. 66th over: England 164-6 (Buttler 29, Overton 11) Overton survives another LBW shout from Lyon. Outside the line I reckon, though it was close. A maiden. Overton has survived 38 balls, which is a fine effort in the circumstances. If there were three Overtons to come, England would have a chance. \u201cIs it possible that injuries, loss of form and Smith have meant that the Aussies will retain the Ashes rather than big selection errors or structural failings in English cricket?\u201d says Niall Mullen. Yes. But I\u2019d also argue this England team has been drifting and underachieving for three or four years now. You can\u2019t just ignore that and keep picking players on reputation. It\u2019s all become a bit Gerrard/Lampard. And it\u2019s about bloody time Stewart Downing got a game! 65th over: England 164-6 (Buttler 29, Overton 11) Starc returns to the attack, and Buttler times a lovely square drive for four. A bit of traffic news: a pile-up of wickets earlier this afternoon has caused a bit of a delay, which means England fans won\u2019t arrive in the village of Hope until at least 5pm. (There are 40 overs remaining.) \u201cPlease stick in a mention for Afghanistan, who have to take just four wickets in a full day tomorrow, with a 262-run cushion, to beat Bangladesh at home,\u201d says Romeo. \u201cBangladesh are not easily beaten at home.\u201d Yes, good point. That\u2019ll be a monstrous and thoroughly heartwarming victory. I see Rashid Khan is having a heck of a match on his debut as captain. 64th over: England 160-6 (Buttler 25, Overton 11) The ball was changed a few overs ago, and the replacement is doing all sorts - conventional swing, rather than reverse. Overton ignores all that and thumps Hazlewood through extra cover for four. He\u2019s batting with admirable determination. \u201cAfternoon, Rob,\u201d says Phil Sawyer. \u201cGiven the intervening years of indulging in wine, women more wine and quite a lot of cheese, I fear it may be futile to dig out the Is It Cowardly To Pray For Rain T-shirt for entirely different reasons. The passage of time has not been kind...\u201d A base layer like that would surely be a talking point in the locker room. 63rd over: England 155-6 (Buttler 24, Overton 7) \u201cReplace Root as captain, bring in Morgan,\u201d says Sandra Panter. \u201cDrop Roy, bring in a bowling all-rounder for Bairstow or Butler. Curran should get a call, it\u2019s too late but they have to do something.\u201d It\u2019s too late for Morgan, sadly. I\u2019d have him as captain in a heartbeat, even if he averaged 4.21 with the bat, but his back and possibly his mind wouldn\u2019t allow it. Overton survives! The third umpire decided there wasn\u2019t conclusive evidence of an inside-edge, which was absurd, but it didn\u2019t matter because the ball hit Overton outside the off stump. There would have been plenty of controversy had that been given out. I have a nasty feeling the third umpire is going to give this out. There\u2019s a clear inside edge Clive! Overton is given out LBW to Cummins but reviews. There\u2019s a last-gasp inside edge, he\u2019ll be fine. It was another huge inswinger from Cummins. 62nd over: England 153-6 (Buttler 24, Overton 5) Hazlewood replaces Lyon. Buttler, who has shown his flexibility with a determined defensive innings, survives another over. He\u2019s had a bad series, a stinker really, but he\u2019s starting to find a bit of form. \u201cPlease can we have experiments at an Oval dead rubber Test?\u201d says Dominic O\u2019Reilly. \u201cI\u2019ve missed that so much. Half the One-Test Wonders Club must have achieved eligibility there. Paul Parker, John Stephenson, Alan Wells, Joey Benjamin, Neil Williams and Simon Kerrigan - who will swell their ranks?\u201d That\u2019s such a good point. CricViz statistics show that 78.41 per cent of WTF England selections have taken place for the last Test of the summer at the Oval. 61st over: England 152-6 (Buttler 24, Overton 4) This is blistering stuff from Cummins. Buttler does well to fend a lifter just short of the slips amd then survives a huge LBW appeal from a hooping inswinger. It was just clipping leg, so the original decision would have stood even if Australia had reviewed. It was more beautiful bowling from Cummins, who set Buttler up with a series of outswingers. 60th over: England 150-6 (Buttler 22, Overton 4) Overton uses his reach to smother a couple of deliveries from Lyon. A bit of flight tempts him into a big drive; he misses and the ball scuttles between Paine\u2019s legs for four byes. There are 45 overs remaining. 59th over: England 146-6 (Buttler 22, Overton 4) An absurd delivery from Cummins, a swinging 88mph legbreak, beats Buttler by a long way. It\u2019s the start of a majestic over to Buttler that includes an edge short of slip and three plays-and-misses. Since you asked, England were also six down at this stage at Cardiff in 2009. No. 58th over: England 146-6 (Buttler 22, Overton 4) Overton is a very useful lower-order batsman, with a highest first-class score of 138. He\u2019s applying himself diligently, but asking him to hang around for 50 overs is a bit much. He survives a big LBW appeal from Lyon, who beat him on the inside with a lovely off-break. It hit Overton outside the line. \u201cIs it cowardly to bring out your \u2018Is it cowardly to pray for rain?\u2019 shirt?\u201d says David Slider, including a photo of said T-shirt. It\u2019s not cowardly, but it is futile \u2013 the forecast is fine until 6am tomorrow. 57th over: England 142-6 (Buttler 20, Overton 2) Pat Cummins returns. You\u2019d have to be a miserably little Englander to begrudge this man an Ashes victory. He\u2019s taken 24 wickets at 17 in this series, and he\u2019s bought a few for his mates as well - not least on Friday, when he tenderised Joe Root for the benefit of Josh Hazlewood. \u201cDrop Bairstow?\u201d says Richard Holmes. \u201cBig call that. Take the gloves off him. Give them to Foakes.\u201d He\u2019s averaging 29 over a three-year period. That\u2019s sub-Hick, and that poor bloke was dropped every three games, never mind every three years. Bairstow has the talent to be England\u2019s second-best batsman after Root, I agree, but you can\u2019t keep picking on reputation and potential. I also think the dressing-room needs a cattle prod to the lower middle order, and a winter off would reinforce Bairstow\u2019s clarity sufficiently that he\u2019d score millions of runs when he eventually gets back in the team. In other news, you may or may not recall an email from Sam Wrighton on Friday. He was asking for an emergency pitch for his team\u2019s title decider the following day. Well, thanks to you lot, a pitch was found in Walthamstow - and Sam\u2019s team, Hackney CC, won the North East London Cricket League title. Hurrah for them. Hurrah for you, dear readers. 56th over: England 141-6 (Buttler 20, Overton 1) A hint of reverse swing from Starc to Buttler, who gets a thick edge through point for a couple. Batting is pretty tricky now: spin, reverse swing, uneven bounce. For all Australia\u2019s clear superiority, this was an excellent toss to win. \u201cWith twice as many wickets,\u201d says J.A. Hopkin, \u201cEngland still haven\u2019t reached Australia\u2019s first-innings total...\u201d You say that like it\u2019s a bad thing. 55th over: England 139-6 (Buttler 18, Overton 1) With the lower order exposed, Nathan Lyon returns to the attack. Not much happens. \u201cRob,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cIt looks pretty likely that Australia will retain the Ashes today, in which case the Oval becomes a dead rubber. So will the selectors continue to stick with the current squad (for sentimental reasons mainly) or try out a few more alternatives? If so, who gets the nod and who gets dumped? It might swing on how they want to choose players for the short form games against the Kiwis, but red-ball cricket needs all the players to gain experience.\u201d I doubt they will make many changes, the rationale being that the series can still be drawn. I don\u2019t really mind either way, but I would omit a few players from the winter tours - Roy, Bairstow, probably Denly, maybe Buttler. It\u2019s time to start again, again. I\u2019d probably bring in Sibley, Pope and Foakes, maybe Northeast as well. A lot depends on whether Root stays as captain. I wouldn\u2019t want to be in Ed Smith\u2019s loafers. 54th over: England 139-6 (Buttler 18, Overton 1) Won\u2019t be long now. Overton does well to keep out a lively first delivery from Starc and edges his second through the slips, all along the floor. Bairstow, meanwhile, is averaging 25 in this series and 29 since the start of 2017. Time for a change, I think. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that our hotel pool has an underwater sound system,\u201d says Kim Thonger, \u201cand as a person of advanced years this is an entirely new experience. I\u2019m trying to persuade the lifeguard to play Test Match Special through it. It seems to me that Geoffrey Boycott and Michael Vaughan will make more sense aquatically. I think \u2018stick of rhubarb\u2019 and \u2018new cherry\u2019 should be identifiable but worried \u2018corridor of uncertainty\u2019 will sound like whale song.\u201d Gone! It was a good ball from Mitchell Starc, angled in from round the wicket. It hit Bairstow above the knee roll, so he was right to review - but it was umpire\u2019s call and that was enough for Australia. Bairstow is out LBW to the first ball after drinks! And he\u2019s reviewed. Of course he has. I reckon this is umpire\u2019s call on height. That\u2019s drinks, and it\u2019s also handover time. Great fun today, thanks for your company, and apologies to the many correspondents who we weren\u2019t able to reply to. We love your messages, keep them coming. Rob Smyth will take the Statham steering wheel from here. 53rd over: England 138-5 (Bairstow 25, Buttler 18) So now it transpires that Head was the swingman. Or was Starc the swingman? Because Labuschagne has moved around to the Statham End. Had a message in from a friend in Australia yesterday asking if I could confirm that Old Trafford had a Jason Statham End. Reader, it does not. Brian, yes. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the car?\u201d \u201cSeats and a steering wheel.\u201d Buttler blocks out most of Labuschagne\u2019s over, but glances a single late. Marnus is around the wicket to Bairstow, but bowls a full toss and gets whacked for three runs to deep midwicket. 52 overs left to face, 245 runs to get. 52nd over: England 134-5 (Bairstow 22, Buttler 17) Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s spell was all of one over. Travis Head is coming on from the Pavilion End, bowling some part-time off spin. Bowls a fair bit in T20 cricket, and has 40 first-class wickets, but he\u2019s a relief bowler more than a wicket-taker. He finds a bit of turn late in the over, but has to go very wide of the stumps to get it. Bairstow sees out a maiden, delighted to tick another over off the total without having to face a more difficult bowler. 51st over: England 134-5 (Bairstow 22, Buttler 17) Starc is just helping a few deliveries trickle by. Full on the pads, worked for a run. Wide of off stump, left. Short and angled at the body, blocked. Gets the length better from the fourth ball onward. Buttler blocks him out from the crease. 54 overs. 50th over: England 133-5 (Bairstow 21, Buttler 17) Time for some leg-spin then. Young Marnie Labuschagne will come on from the Pavilion End for a twirl. Hazlewood still on the field despite bowling only a couple of overs, he\u2019s one of the pillars at mid-on with Cummins at mid-off. Like the big stone kings astride the river in the Lord of the Rings. The Labrador drops too short in this over, allowing the batsmen to set back and punch singles through point: once, twice, thrice. Finally pitches up to win a couple of dot balls. 55 overs to go. 49th over: England 130-5 (Bairstow 19, Buttler 16) Hazlewood is off after two overs. Change of ends, perhaps? Mitchell Starc is on though, and he wouldn\u2019t be the swingman. Starc starts off in his inaccurate iteration, bouncing a couple down leg, leaving one very wide of off, bowling on the pads for Bairstow to flick a couple of runs. Three, even. \u201cLeaving out Curran looking a pretty rubbish decision now?\u201d Well Matthew, it depends what part of the remaining 56 overs he can bat out this afternoon. 48th over: England 127-5 (Bairstow 16, Buttler 16) Lyon pitches fuller, and Bairstow drives him down the ground for four! Good shot, even if it was unnecessary in the circumstances. Not quite full enough to be entirely safe, even though the shot worked this time. Bairstow works a single square, then Buttler whips through long-on for four more! That was fuller, from around the wicket, and Buttler was confident to play a fluent stroke against it. Nine runs from the over, 256 behind, 57 overs left. 47th over: England 118-5 (Bairstow 11, Buttler 12) I wonder if Hazlewood is just setting up these two batsmen for the outswinger or cutter. Again, his over is right on the spot outside off, decking in. Bairstow jabs a single from the fifth ball. There are 58 overs left. \u201cWas there a chance that Denley\u2019s hand was off the bat before it struck his hand? A la Michael Kasprowicz in 2005?\u201d asks Martin Laidler. I didn\u2019t look at it that forensically, but you would think the batsman would know if he\u2019d let go the bat? 46th over: England 117-5 (Bairstow 10, Buttler 12) Just a single from Lyon\u2019s over for Bairstow, pushed away behind point. \u201cHappy for Cummins,\u201d writes David Seare. \u201cAs England followers we just heard that he wasn\u2019t playing in a given series every couple of years, without understanding what he\u2019s had to go through to get fit to play. I heard him interviewed on your podcast and he deserves all the success he gets.\u201d 45th over: England 116-5 (Bairstow 9, Buttler 12) Ten overs, 4 maidens, 2 for 23 in the spell for Cummins. He\u2019s now replaced by Hazlewood. In similar style, he\u2019s banging the ball onto the seam and making it jag into Buttler, time and again. Buttler leaves one that whistles over his stumps, but makes it through a maiden. 44th over: England 116-5 (Bairstow 9, Buttler 12) Again Bairstow is able to turn a run away first ball of Lyon\u2019s over. Again Buttler goes against the turn, and this time gets the gap at cover for three. Lyon comes around the wicket, but slips the ball well down leg side for a bye. Buttler turns a single, like Bairstow. England have 61 overs to survive. 43rd over: England 108-5 (Bairstow 7, Buttler 7) Bairstow is bunny-hopping to start Cummins\u2019 10th over in a row, squirting runs away behind square on one side of the wicket and then the other. Buttler when he gets strike just tries to keep the bowling out. Surely that\u2019s the end of Postman Pat for a while? 42nd over: England 105-5 (Bairstow 4, Buttler 7) Bairstow gets away from Lyon first ball, backing away and turning a single. Buttler looks less comfortable, letting the ball hit him a few times when he thinks it\u2019s short enough. Every ball is spinning big. When it\u2019s too full, Buttler drives against the spin to cover, but hits the field. England trail by 278, and have 378 balls to survive. 41st over: England 104-5 (Bairstow 3, Buttler 7) Cummins will continue, his ninth over in a row with the lunch break in between. Angling in at the stumps, perhaps moving away a touch, and Buttler gets a thick outside edge along the ground for four. Cummins strays onto the pads and Buttler clips a couple, then to vent his frustration Cummins bangs in a bouncer too short, and four byes are added! Unfair to Paine, who could never have reached that. Cummins pitches up again, chastened, and beats the outside edge. The hundred has come up for England, greeted with hearty applause. English crowds love doomed resistance almost more than winning, don\u2019t they? 40th over: England 94-5 (Bairstow 3, Buttler 1) Faint hope recedes even more for England. Their last recognised pair now. Buttler manages to get through Lyon\u2019s over, though the ball is now turning prodigiously. Gets off the mark turning a run away. England have 390 more deliveries to survive. Finally, Nathan Lyon takes a wicket! He has been straining and ever more frustrated. Denly\u2019s fine vigil is over. Like the last over against Bairstow, it was high bounce that did for him. It takes Denly\u2019s glove, into his body, and away to short leg, and this time the fielder can dive forward and get under the ball. 39th over: England 92-4 (Denly 53, Bairstow 2) Cummins continues, but a couple of bumpers don\u2019t faze Denly too much. He gets down underneath them, and those are two fewer deliveries that England have to face today. 38th over: England 92-4 (Denly 53, Bairstow 2) Bairstow to Lyon, and will have to resist the temptation to have a pop. So far it\u2019s working, with Bairstow trying to play him from the crease. But playing back has its own risks, as Lyon gets one to bounce very high, nearly taking the glove... it ends up with short leg. I can\u2019t tell if that bounced just in front? I think it did. Glove, then turf, then the hands of Labuschagne. 37th over: England 92-4 (Denly 53, Bairstow 2) There\u2019s the milestone for Denly, with a perfect straight drive! Too full from Cummins and it gave the batsman a chance. His third Test fifty, his second in this Ashes. But where he looked all at sea during the fifty at Headingley, he\u2019s got better and better today aside from some early nonsense against Lyon. He has defended stoutly against some outstanding fast bowling, and has started to flourish with his shots as he\u2019s gone on. 36th over: England 88-4 (Denly 49, Bairstow 2) Lyon from the other end. He\u2019s holding up that end well, but no wicket as yet. He\u2019s looked threatening at times, but maybe not consistently. Denly gets the first run after lunch off his pads. 35th over: England 87-4 (Denly 48, Bairstow 2) Cummins to start after lunch, and he starts exactly where he left off. Jagging it back off the seam, smashing Bairstow in the thigh. A warning that the ball will keep moving. Cummins does it again for good measure. Then tests Bairstow with a wider line, but Young Jonny doesn\u2019t play. How do they remember whose turn it is to take strike after the lunch break? And who is allowed to bowl? And from which end? Umpires have a lot of invisible work to do. I would never remember any of that. I hope you\u2019re adequately provisioned after the break? The umpires are coming back out. The Australian team has massed on the boundary and will now cross it. And here comes Denly with Bairstow trailing him to the wicket. Forget about the runs \u2013 no one is getting 150 per session on the last day. It\u2019s the overs that matter. England need to get through 71 of them. The chances of that happening are obviously very slim. But one must retain belief until all hope is gone. Denly should win praise for his resistance, but he needs to double or triple that stay at the crease. As for Australia, what a session for Pat Cummins. What a Test match for him. What a bowler. Two wickets in two balls last night, with the ball of the summer to England\u2019s captain. Then two of the most classy and quality spells in this morning session, first knocking over Jason Roy and then, so vitally, Ben Stokes. Cummins has 4 for 23, and deserves more in the hours to come. I\u2019m going to grab a bite to eat, and I suggest you do the same. Let\u2019s all look after ourselves, hey? 34th over: England 87-4 (Denly 48, Bairstow 2) Last over before lunch, and well played Joe Denly. England have every reason to be grateful to him, as he blocks out Hazlewood calmly to reach the interval. One session down, two to go. 33rd over: England 87-4 (Denly 48, Bairstow 2) Cummins just tiring a bit perhaps with the break looming. Bowls a bit wider, and then a bit straighter to be picked off for a couple. He also oversteps for a no ball. 32nd over: England 84-4 (Denly 48, Bairstow 0) With 13 minutes to lunch, Josh Hazlewood will come back for a little rumble. Denly works his loosener square for two, but Large Josh is on the money just after that, decking a ball in to hit the bat flap and nearly get him lbw. Just a bit high. Hazlewood overpitches after that and Denly creams it through cover for four. That\u2019s his classiest shot of the day. \u201cI reckon you cannot legitimately used the term \u2018walked\u2019 as long as the other side has reviews left,\u201d emails Andrew. The batsman doesn\u2019t know if the bowling side will use one, though. How confident are they? And will the technology be conclusivce enough to overturn a decision? Stokes started walking as soon as he heard the appeal. 31st over: England 78-4 (Denly 42, Bairstow 0) Cummins has another right-hander to hassle with the ball that cuts back in, having got Stokes with one nicking away. Bairstow is the new batsman, and there\u2019s a hefty appeal against him as the ball comes off his thigh pad, bounces before it reaches the cordon, and spins away to elude keeper and slip for four leg byes. Those extras don\u2019t go against the bowler, so it\u2019s a wicket maiden for Cummins. He gets a huge standing O from the crowd at long leg when he goes to the fence to field. There will be no miracle! Stokes has walked! Back of a length from Cummins, the ball decked in. Stokes was trying to leave, couldn\u2019t get the bat up out of the way, and it takes a little inside edge still in the backlift through to Tim Paine! It almost takes the corner of the toe of the bat. The Australian captain rolls across to the leg side to take the ball, then bounds up and is jubilant. Umpire Erasmus says no, but Stokes tucks his bat under his arm and goes off! The Ashes surely, surely, are gone for England as well. 30th over: England 74-3 (Denly 42, Stokes 1) Lyon to Stokes, who plays back in his crease so often that the spinner always thinks he\u2019s in the game. Looking for the pads, but Lyon drops short at one point and Stokes belts it straight into poor Marnus under the lid. Saves a few runs. The batsman gets one by turning it off his pads, and he\u2019s off the mark. 29th over: England 73-3 (Denly 42, Stokes 0) The Cummins Show continues, this time decking away from Denly to just beat the edge. This is like one of those nights when you just hang onto the floor and hope to survive. Denly stands up tall and defends the next. As soon as he gets a ball a touch shorter and wider, so the stumps aren\u2019t threatened, Denly is trying to force through the off side, but gets a thick edge to leg instead. Can\u2019t quite compose himself to put those shots away and just get through the spell. It\u2019s another maiden. 28th over: England 73-3 (Denly 42, Stokes 0) Lyon bowls a maiden to Stokes, who is beaten once by a big turner, but otherwise gets through without alarm. 27th over: England 73-3 (Denly 42, Stokes 0) This is an absolutely monstrous spell from Cummins. Who would want to face it? Ball after ball carves in off the seam, bashing Denly in the pads, making him fear for stumps every time. He manages to get something between it and them, unlike Roy. Finally he gets a bouncer to duck, then manages to glide away a boundary and a single to third man. I\u2019m not sure either shot was about scoring, he just held the bat there to cover off stump and get the ball away, anywhere but here. You\u2019ve got to respect Denly for getting through that over. 26th over: England 67-3 (Denly 36, Stokes 0) Denly on strike for Lyon and an edge isn\u2019t taken! Can\u2019t call it a drop, that ball took the inside edge into pad, then went almost verically, up past Paine\u2019s ear as he tried to get gloves to it, then there was a thought that slip might get across to take it but it went too fine for that. Stokes gets on strike, and he has two slips and a bat-pad on the off side for the off-spinner, turning the ball away from the left-hander. He manages to negotiate the over. 25th over: England 66-3 (Denly 35) Roy is out from the last ball of the over, and there\u2019s a huuuuuuge cheer as Ben Stokes walks out. He can\u2019t do it again, surely? Brilliance from Cummins! Success for Tim Paine! Starc was preparing to bowl the next over, and then got bumped. Cummins is ushered back instead. And what a first over. He carves the ball back off the seam repeatedly: just missing Denly\u2019s stumps, then taking his pad, then an inside edge past his leg stump. Jason Roy isn\u2019t so lucky. He gropes for the ball, well out in front of his pad, and it unerringly finds the gap and takes out his off stump! No inside edge, pure seam movement at pace. What a bowler. What a ball. 24th over: England 65-2 (Denly 34, Roy 31) The crowd are getting very involved. Lots of Bronx, as Lyon appeals for lbw against Denly and gets turned down. Denly works a couple of runs to midwicket. Then takes a quick single to mid-on, and it\u2019s a bad idea. The run out looks some chance. But Cummins fumbles the take, meaning the batsmen are safe. Then Cummins\u2019 throw is a shocker, mid-pitch rather than either end, and it runs away for two overthrows! Warner has to put in a big sprint to stop it going for four. Bonus for Denly, who has looked much more convincing than he did in Leeds. 23rd over: England 60-2 (Denly 29, Roy 31) Goodness, the bounce is going to be an issue. Before Roy drives a couple of runs straight, Starc gets a ball to creep through him, low and making the batsman squeeze down. Surely someone is going to land the untameable delivery. Like Regina Spektor sang: \u201cAnd it\u2019s only a matter of whom, and it\u2019s only a matter of when.\u201d 22nd over: England 58-2 (Denly 29, Roy 29) Lyon to resume after the beverages. Lots of turn and some inconsistent bounce for him. Paine takes one delivery up around the grille, another down around the shinpads. There\u2019s a big appeal as Roy is struck on the pad but Lyon gestures that it\u2019s hit him outside the line. Roy shimmies to the next ball and drives, but Cummins at mid-on dives to save four. As does Warner at backward square to deny Denly a run off the hip. The batsmen stay in scoring sync. Duncan Stackhouse writes a misty-eyed missive. \u201cI was trying to think of the last time a single batsmen had looked so far ahead of everyone else during an Ashes series and I didn\u2019t have to look back as far as you may expect. Now I\u2019m not saying that the sledgehammer of eternal justice (Ian Ronald Bell) is in the same class as old Stevie but in 2013 He did look a cut above. Around 600 runs at an average of over 60 (25 more than the next best English batsman, KP. \u201cMore than that, much like Smith, he just looked so much better than any other batsman on either side. On more typically English pitches, if memory serves correctly. Without his runs, England\u2019s superior all round attack (for English conditions) would not have had enough runs to win. Anyway, all this got me thinking what we\u2019d give for even late-career, eyes gone, averaging only a tick over 40, coming in at 5 or 6, IRB in this England side. He will forever be gliding fours down to third man in my heart.\u201d I\u2019ll tell you what, if he hadn\u2019t done his Achilles or whatever it was this season, he would have been a chance for an emergency call. The classic coming out of retirement for one last job. 21st over: England 56-2 (Denly 28, Roy 28) Starc comes around the wicket to look for some left-arm angle into the right-handers. It doesn\u2019t bear immediate fruit, with Denly knocking a run to midwicket before Roy comes forwards into an elegant push-drive through extra cover for four! Lovely shot. Crucially and atypically, he didn\u2019t try to smash it. Just used the pace. Moving to 28, Roy has matched his highest score of the series. Has to make this chance count. Drinks. 20th over: England 51-2 (Denly 27, Roy 24) Cheers go up around the ground as England\u2019s 50 comes up, via Roy\u2019s circumspect drive off Lyon through cover. The relentless positivity of an English crowd does have to be admired. 19th over: England 49-2 (Denly 27, Roy 22) The Denly-Starc battle rolls on. Denly is hopping again against a couple, gloving one away and then slicing a bit with a defensive shot. But when there\u2019s width he\u2019s still happy to go for it, lashing at a shorter ball with a cut shot. Not entirely timing it, so he only gets three. But the runs are coming. Roy turns away a single. You can\u2019t argue with fate. 18th over: England 45-2 (Denly 24, Roy 21) Denly is using his feet to Lyon, Roy is hanging back in the crease to play off the pitch. They each get a single, then Denly again tries a big shot. That was absolutely daft. Nearly caught. There are boundary riders out, and he tries a slog-sweep anyway. Gets a big top edge, and it bounces just in front of Travis Head running in at the ball. Very lucky, very foolish. Denly is having an extended rush of blood against the spinner. England trail by 338 and he\u2019s trying to get them by lunch. 17th over: England 42-2 (Denly 22, Roy 20) Starc tries a yorker but it ends up as a shin-high full toss and Denly blocks it out. Then plays an unholy swat a wide ball, chopping it down and into the gully. Could have gone anywhere. Starc strays onto the pads and Denly glances a single, giving Roy a look at another overcooked yorker that the batsman can flick through wide mid-on for four! Cummins thought he had it covered but it just eluded him. Top shot. \u201cEnjoying the updates from my sunbed Hammamet, Tunisia,\u201d writes Martin Woodruff. \u201cHoping Roy can actually get some runs this time.... is he going to be the hero?\u201d I\u2019m assuming that a sunbed is where the sun goes at night. 16th over: England 37-2 (Denly 21, Roy 16) Nathan Lyon on from the Pavilion End. This will be interesting with Roy in the middle as well. Remember Edgbaston (the World Cup semi)? Remember Edgbaston (the first Test)? Funnily though it\u2019s Denly making the aggressive move. He chooses smartly to sweep at a ball well outside his off stump, taking the lbw out of the equation, and nails it square for four! Travis Head dives but can\u2019t save. Then follows up with a similar shot for a single. 15th over: England 32-2 (Denly 16, Roy 16) Get set for action of some sort, because here is Mitchell Starc. Left-arm fast from the Statham End. Full on the pads first up and clipped for one. Denly gets strike and tries to keep the straighter balls out, but when Starc bowls a really loose wide one Denly goes after it, and gets a fat edge over the slips for four! Horizontal slap shot. The batsman follows up with a calmer push for a single. Roy and Denly are 16 and 16. 14th over: England 26-2 (Denly 11, Roy 15) Jason Roy is hopping and dropping one again, jolting forward to keep out Hazlewood on off stump. We saw some inconsistent bounce yesterday, and that will make batting much more of a lottery than it was on a fourth-day pitch at Headingley. Roy misses out on a gift down leg side, but finds a run off his pads next ball. He\u2019s getting them in singles. \u201cOn subject of Root\u2019s conversion rate of 50s to 100s and whether he is a great or just a good batsman,\u201d writes Andrew Cruikshank, \u201cmy impression (without statistics to hand) is that at the start of his career he was well on the way to becoming a great batsman (and was an excellent slip). Then he was made captain, in which capacity he is no more than competent.\u201d That\u2019s the general impression, but it\u2019s not quite right. His ratio of hundreds per match is about the same with or without the captaincy. I\u2019d guess that his conversion rate got noticed a lot more as the leader who is supposed to make the defining score rather than the up and coming player who is a talent for the future. His conversion issue is marked though: 59 scores over 50, and only 16 hundreds. Compare that to Smith: 52 scores over 50, 26 hundreds. 13th over: England 25-2 (Denly 11, Roy 14) Good grief, Pat Cummins is bowling a gorgeous spell. Under lovely blue skies, he\u2019s getting the ball to skip sideways, at high pace, around the off stump. One goes straight through Roy, beating the inside edge and nearly bowling him. Another draws a thick miscued inside edge away for a single, Roy jolting forward at it, bending double. This is survival batting at the moment, Roy doesn\u2019t look like a player with the tools to cope. He just has to find a way through, no matter how it looks, and hope that things get easier. 12th over: England 24-2 (Denly 11, Roy 13) Now it\u2019s Roy\u2019s turn to be hit on the pad, with Hazlewood bowling. Again it\u2019s missing, but this seems a matter of time. Hazlewood tries again and Roy manages to stab a single away awkwardly from leg stump. England trail by 359. 11th over: England 23-2 (Denly 11, Roy 12) Cummins to Denly now and nearly gets him twice, first chipping up a defensive shot that bounces in front of mid-off, then missing a ball that cuts in and hits him in front of leg stump. Just going down. Lee Henderson emails in. \u201cJust picking up on a point that\u2019s been made by BTL and ATL pundits; Australia have not just one great bowler in Cummins as England does at the moment in Broad but they have another two in Hazelwood and Starc. Archer\u2019s trajectory was incendiary but like all fireworks they sometimes splutter and fizz. Australia\u2019s attack is three world class quicks. Smith is freaky but, I still think it\u2019s a team effort this series and down to one individual alone. Not a lot of point having a V12 Lambo with out a gearbox or wheels is there.\u201d The bowling attack is definitely excellent. It\u2019s more a case that Australia\u2019s batting outside Smith was so poor that there was zero chance of giving those bowlers enough room to win a Test had Smith not been there. Great batsmen can give more modest bowlers enough room to win a Test, but even the best bowlers can\u2019t rescue many games with no runs to defend. 10th over: England 23-2 (Denly 11, Roy 12) Woof. Hazlewood bowls an absolute beauty, almost as good as the one Cummins bowled yesterday. It just wasn\u2019t on line to take the stumps, and instead beat Denly\u2019s edge by a micron. After five balls Denly manages to drop a single to the off side and run away. Not nice. Now he\u2019ll get to face Cummins as a break. 9th over: England 22-2 (Denly 10, Roy 12) Now then. Jason Roy batting for a draw. Rather like a dog trying to drive a bus. Things that are not suited to one another. Jason Roy playing a World Cup innings might put the frighteners on Australia though. A brisk 150 and they\u2019ll be rattled. He\u2019s only... 142 short of that. Make that 138, as he flicks uppishly off his pads through midwicket for four. Otherwise Cummins bowls an unimpeachable line, which Roy plays an uncertain sequence of defensive shots to, seeming to glance up at the Bayliss Balcony each time to say \u201cAm I doing this right?\u201d 8th over: England 18-2 (Denly 10, Roy 8) We\u2019re away, Josh Hazlewood thudding in with that heavy-footed plonk of a run-up. He thuds, but the ball zings when he sends it down. Roy and Denly are batting together: which is the opener again, and which the second drop? Can\u2019t remember, and it doesn\u2019t matter in the end. Here they are. Hazlewood jags one in his first set, back into Denly and into the pad. Going down leg. It\u2019s a maiden! To pre-empt most of you, and post-empt a couple of the keener beans, here is the TMS link for overseas listeners. Get us in your eyes while it\u2019s in your ears. (This is today\u2019s link, don\u2019t be fooled by the fact that Joe Root is smiling.) Good morning from Manchester. It\u2019s a glorious day, it\u2019s sunny and not even particularly cold, and the wind has gone away. Aaaah, yes. Ok folks, I can just about hear the J of Jerusalem which means it\u2019s time for me to vacate my seat and allow Geoff Lemon to take you through the morning session. Retune your emails to geoff.lemon@theguardian.com and redirect your tweets to @GeoffLemonSport. Stuart Broad\u2019s domination of David Warner has been one of the enduring storylines of the summer, as Ali Martin reports. Warner has done some remarkable things in the longest format. There have been 21 hundreds. One of them was the rare beast that is a century before lunch \u2013 a 78-ball blitz against Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground \u2013 while three times he has passed three-figures in both innings. But this summer, after a bumper return in the World Cup, Warner has been kept down by Broad. In eight innings the right-armer has had his number six times. Only once has Warner made it past double figures and in that instance, the gritty 61 on the opening day at Headingley, it involved several heavy slices of fortune with ball doing too much under leaden skies. The absence of James Anderson has been felt throughout this series, none more so than at Old Trafford, a venue with an end named after the Lancastrian seamer. To ram home that point it was two years ago today that Anderson racked up his 500th Test wicket and celebrated career-best figures of 7/42. Trevor Bayliss is holding on for a hero. Geoff Lemon will be around in about 20 minutes or so to take over this blog. If you can\u2019t wait until then to read his thoughts, here is riffing on Steve Smith and his one-man army. If Australia do what they should by retaining the Ashes, and if they go on to win the series, it will feel thoroughly disingenuous to say that \u201cAustralia\u201d did any such thing. Team sports are all about crediting the collective but in this case you can\u2019t credibly do so. Australia\u2019s captain, Tim Paine, started the series with a misfired attempt at a Winston Churchill quote; he could end it more accurately with \u201cNever was so much owed by so many to so few\u201d. Gregory Pemberton is already looking ahead to future series and better selections. \u201cWhat were the Aussie selectors thinking, having four lefties in the top six, especially when Joe Burns is better credentialed than most of them? A possible Ashes victory should not obscure this.\u201d Note the phrasing from England\u2019s official Twitter account here. Not \u201ccan we win\u201d... Matthew Wade has long got under the skin of his opponents. His latest target was Jofra Archer, but as Barney Ronay writes, the Englishman exacted his revenge. With any luck, Archer v Wade will fade into the background, an oddity in the middle of a largely good-natured contest. However, it was at best an encouraging riposte from a cricketer whose career is likely to revolve around managing his own tension, raising his levels at the right moment, blocking out the background hum; and in giving the right answer in his own way, as he did here on a day of rising drama all round. \u201cDoes anyone know how to copyright a newspaper headline?\u201d enquires Alex Gaywood. \u201cI fancy making a few quid from the inevitable When a Roy becomes a Man that all the papers will be leading with tomorrow after Jason leads us home with a magnificent double century. Nothing like a blind bit of optimism eh?\u201d Let me just check with Jeremy... Bill Lawrenson is bringing Kate Bush into things. \u201cI\u2019m imagining Stokes pacing the dressing room, already padded up at sunrise this morning, while listening to this. In the meantime, Joe Root is randomly positioning the cloudbuster in the outfield in the forlorn hope of creating rain.\u201d How did we get here? Vic Marks has all you need to know. Another miracle is required here for England to keep the pursuit of the Ashes alive. They began their second innings half an hour before the close and the ball was tossed to Pat Cummins, rather than Mitchell Starc, who had had that privilege in the first innings. This proved a good option that may well have decided the destination of the Ashes. We\u2019ve located the one Australian cricket fan lacking confidence, and his name is Rick Chapman. \u201cLogic suggests an Australian victory but I have this nagging feeling we may lose a series where we were the better team for most days. England are fighting hard when it matters most - e.g. Lord\u2019s day 5, Headingley day 4...\u201d Ian Forth has logged on to entertain the troops. \u201cLook no further than the Chennai Test of 2008,\u201d he emails. \u201cEngland declared leaving India an improbable 387 to win. Sehwag went nuts, Tendulkar got a ton and India cruised home four wickets down. Cut and paste Roy and Denly into the last sentence, and Australia are staring down the barrel.\u201d Martin Laidler has sent in an email dealing with a topic I\u2019m sure many of you will be familiar with. \u201cI\u2019m hugely confused,\u201d he begins. \u201cAre England terrible, or do the Aussies just have a really good bowling attack? Or are England actually rather good but Steve Smith is just outstanding? Or are Australia and England equally bad but the Aussies have an unlimited trump card in use? Should we run a control experiment where Smith alternates between teams and we then take an aggregate score? Please help.\u201d I like the sound of that suggestion at the end - not just for this series but for all Tests. In short, I think it\u2019s a bit of all of the above. England clearly have some glaring issues with their batting, as their form over the past few years has proven. However, the quality and depth of Australia\u2019s attack should not be underestimated, nor the way the touring party prepared for the series. Smith clearly is on another level and it will be fascinating to see how other sides attempt to deal with him over the coming years. Obviously he relishes playing England but his average overall is second only to Bradman, so, yeah, he\u2019s that good. I do think we need to factor in all those variables when considering the series though. It cannot be just written off as a Smith freakshow, or a crisis in English cricket. This has been a series full of nuance, just one where Australia have largely had the upper hand. Some admin from the good folk at Lancashire CCC. A reminder that today is already a sell out, so don\u2019t make your way down to Old Trafford on the off-chance. And if you are making your way there from Manchester city centre, leave yourself plenty of time because the trams are not running. The weather is contemptuously glorious at Old Trafford. Trust Manchester to forget where it put the drizzle when England need it most. The forecast is for a dry, still, cool day, ideal for bowling long spells and singing Under the Southern Cross. The pitch looks very serviceable for day five. An optimist would suggest there\u2019s nothing in the surface for England to worry about if they bat diligently. Off-spinner Nathan Lyon again looms large but the skill and variety of the trio of pacemen alongside him have done the damage so far and will begin the day with a ball just seven overs old, and have access to a second new ball 25-overs before the scheduled close - should they require one. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the final day of the fourth Test from Old Trafford. Savour it England fans because these could be the final hours during which the destination of the Ashes remains in dispute. That is because Australia are well on top of this contest, requiring just eight further wickets for victory. The touring attack now has more control over England\u2019s destiny than the minority government. After a lacklustre start to this Test England showed flashes of ticker on day three but it still wasn\u2019t enough to remove Steve Smith cheaply, nor repel Pat Cummins late in the day when the world\u2019s best bowler showed just why he sits on top of the ICC rankings. His dismissal of Joe Root for a golden duck may well be remembered as fondly as that of Simon Jones bamboozling Michael Clarke back in 2005, one of those occasions where the greatness of the delivery, the stature of the batsman, and the timing within the series, all coalesced to form one perfect moment. Of course, Ben Stokes could yet make it three miracles in one summer and compel even James Randi to question the presence of a supernatural being. Such an intervention cannot be discounted, but the brittleness of England\u2019s batting order means even if Stokes does do something absurd again the Englishmen at the other end of the pitch still have to survive a day totalling 98 overs against a relentless, skilful attack.

      "bodyText": "Before every tournament she plays and every move she makes, Bianca Andreescu sits down, closes her eyes and visualises exactly how the results will end in her favour. It has become one of the keys to her success, something she never fails to mention as people continue their attempts to make sense of one of the most astonishing breakthroughs in recent years, which culminated in the 19-year-old\u2019s 6-3, 7-5 win against Serena Williams in the US Open final on Saturday. Such is the Romanian-Canadian\u2019s commitment to thinking and speaking her successes into existence, she celebrated her triumph at the Orange Bowl in 2015, one of the most prestigious junior tournaments in the world, by writing herself a replica US Open prize-money cheque. Each year, she would update the cheque in line with the yearly prize money hike, refreshing her motivation for another season ahead. After she finally held the real thing, all $3,850,000 of it, she thought back to four years earlier and cried. \u201cAfter I won the Orange Bowl, a couple months after, I really believed that I could be at this stage. Since then, honestly I\u2019ve been visualising it almost every single day. For it to become a reality is just so crazy. I guess these visualisations really, really work!\u201d So much of Andreescu\u2019s rise has been incredible. Last year Naomi Osaka seemed to set the standard for sudden breakthroughs after she started 2018 ranked 77th and finished it as the US Open champion. But one year before her victory, Andreescu had not even broken into the top 100. Ranked well outside the top 200, she lost meekly in the first round of qualifying here, hampered by a back injury and miserable off the court. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going through a good period in my life at that point,\u201d she says. \u201cI was having problems with some relationships in my life, with my body, and even my mind, too ... But I\u2019m glad I went through it because at one point you have to.\u201d Andreescu is now 45-4 this year, she has a remarkable record of success against top-10 players and the last time she lost a completed match was on 1 March.

In 2002, the then Howard government decided to limit Australia\u2019s acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the international court of justice and international tribunal for the law of the sea. The government was at the time involved in sensitive maritime boundary negotiations with Timor-Leste that would split the lucrative oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea. The move effectively shielded Australia from cases lodged in the international courts about maritime boundary disputes, denying Timor-Leste an avenue of recourse it enjoyed under international law. Two years later, Australia sent spies to bug the offices of Timor-Leste\u2019s government to gain an upper hand in the same negotiations, a mission that would have remained secret without the actions of Witness K, an Australian intelligence officer, and the lawyer Bernard Collaery. Their actions led to the renegotiation of the maritime boundary, and the signing of a second treaty last year, which gave Timor-Leste a far better deal. Patrick now wants the Australian government to revoke the 2002 declarations limiting its acceptance of the jurisdiction of the courts. \u201cAustralia\u2019s commitment to international law was pushed aside in a shameless effort to grab as much as possible of the oil and gas resources of the Timor Sea,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThis was a historic wrong that needs to be fixed.\u201d The Centre Alliance senator plans this week to move a motion calling on the foreign minister to report to the Senate on the government\u2019s view on revoking the 2002 declarations. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Patrick will also refer the matter to parliament\u2019s joint standing committee on treaties for consideration. That committee previously considered the matter in 2002, and dissenting members warned the decisions risked undermining Australia\u2019s international reputation. \u201cSpecifically these members believe that the ICJ declaration made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs damages Australia\u2019s international reputation and may not be in Australia\u2019s long-term national interests,\u201d the committee said in 2002. \u201cThe declaration may be interpreted as an effort to intimidate and limit the options of neighbouring countries in relation to any future maritime border disputes.\u201d Patrick is hopeful of Labor\u2019s support this week. In 2002, the Labor opposition expressed serious concern at the Howard government\u2019s move. Then shadow foreign minister Kevin Rudd and shadow attorney general Robert McClelland said it marked a \u201chistoric departure from Australia\u2019s proud record\u201d of accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the international courts. \u201cThat position has enjoyed bipartisan support since 1975,\u201d Rudd and McClelland said. \u201cIt said to the world that Australia honours its international obligations and has nothing to hide.\u201d Patrick said the issue must be rectified as a matter of urgency. \u201cThis has been a long-standing international embarrassment for Australia that should be brought to an end without further delay,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Last year, Tamara Burt had to reschedule her job agency appointments five times in a row. She just couldn\u2019t get out of bed without feeling woozy. And so the agency, a disability employment services provider, reduced her Newstart allowance each day until she went in for a meeting. \u201cBy the time I ended up getting my payment, it was pretty much only half of it,\u201d said Burt, 33. The Bendigo woman has an autoimmune condition but doctors have been unable to give her an exact diagnosis, which means she cannot get on to the disability support pension. She thinks it might be chronic fatigue syndrome but she also has a range of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cIf I go out for just as much as an hour, I end up feeling really woeful for at least three days,\u201d she said. On Monday, a new study will confirm Burt\u2019s story is likely a common one. The study shows Newstart recipients are six times more likely to face poor health outcomes and suffer an \u201cincreased prevalence of disease in multiple categories\u201d. In what researchers describe as the first report to look at broad health outcomes for Newstart and disability support pension recipients, the Monash University study finds these people reported \u201cstark\u201d differences in their health outcomes compared with those in paid work. Australia\u2019s 700,000 Newstart recipients were more likely to be hospitalised than wage earners, more often reported \u201cmental and behavioural problems\u201d and generally faced an \u201cincreased burden of ill health\u201d. The lead researcher, Prof Alex Collie, told Guardian Australia that an increase in the rate of the unemployment benefit could turn these health outcomes around and help get people back into work. Using data from the National Health Survey, the researchers were able to analyse self-reported health conditions, and the use of health services and medicines among Newstart and the disability pension recipients compared to those earning a wage. Key findings of the study include: Newstart recipients were 6.8 times as likely to described their own health as poor. Those on the disability pension were 18.3 times more likely to report poor health. Nearly half (48.6%) of Newstart recipients reported \u201cmental or behavioural problems\u201d, compared with 21% among wage earners. Both disability pensioners and Newstart recipients were significantly more likely to report having five or more conditions than wage earners. Newstart recipients were at 1.5 to 2 times increased risk than wage earners of hospitalisation. 70% of disability pensioners reported a behavioural condition, despite only 16% saying it was their primary disability. The report comes as the Morrison government faces growing calls to increase the rate of the Newstart allowance, which is currently $277.85 a week \u2013 or about $40 a day \u2013 for a single person. The Australian Medical Association called for an increase to Newstart in July. Collie said while overseas research found one of the reasons people went on to government benefits was ill health, the situation was compounded by poverty and financial stress. \u201cMy personal view is that an increase in the rate of Newstart would help people to become more healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would help them to afford the things that a lot of us take for granted like food and housing, which are important things if you\u2019re trying to be healthy. \u201cAnd not doing just means we\u2019re putting those people in positions where it\u2019s less likely that they\u2019re going to be able to live a healthy life.\u201d The report also found people on government benefits were less likely to attend health professionals where there were out of pocket costs, such as the dentist or a physical therapist. Burt last went to a dentist was about five years ago. \u201cThat wound up being a birthday present from my grandfather,\u201d she said.

The scene resembled the four days in October 1971 when the UK parliament debated and approved Edward Heath\u2019s Conservative government\u2019s \u201cdecision of principle to join the European Communities on the basis of arrangements which have been negotiated\u201d. Labour whipped its MPs to vote against; 90 rebelled, and the motion passed 356 to 244. Recriminations swiftly followed. The House of Lords approved by 451 to 58 as \u201cbrother passed brother in the Labour party on the way to the lobbies with none of the acrimony of their Commons counterparts\u201d, reported the Guardian.</p> <p>The project put me in parallel yet weirdly similar worlds. Early mornings and lunchtimes I read the 1971 Hansard and Guardian coverage, and in the evenings I watched today\u2019s UK parliamentarians and followed the Guardian coverage. A connection across the years was Jacob Rees-Mogg because his suits and oratorical style brought to mind the older members of the House of Commons of 1971, and his frontbench lounging recalled the great comic actor Jacques Tati\u2019s character Monsieur Hulot.</p> <p>More on eerie similarities later. The result of the journalism comparison favoured today\u2019s Guardian, but not because the reporting and commentary of 48 years ago were inferior. On the contrary: for example, the reporters\u2019 compression of a large number of the speeches was superb. The commentary was as robust then as now. Leader writers in 1971 and last week both reached for variations on \u201cEurophobia\u201d; only the sufferers have changed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Experiencing the two debates in parallel was by turns instructive, amusing and sobering</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Compared with the paper of old, striking differences were the immediacy, variety of voices and richness of content enabled by digital technologies, both for coverage on screens \u2013 desk, iPad and smartphone \u2013 and in the tabloid-size newspaper. In 1971 and 2019 the Guardian recorded who voted how, but today\u2019s coloured, elegant graphics make the information much more digestible. While contemporary coverage prefers short \u201cpull quotes\u201d rather than summaries of an MP\u2019s whole argument, readers today have within easy reach a livestream, short videos, the MP\u2019s own social media presences and perhaps a podcast interview too. The most powerful element in the comparison was the politics live blog. Almost in real time, contributions to the debate are reported now in a kind of telegraphic way, a snippet or chunk at a time, with hyperlinks to explanatory material \u2013 the parliamentary library\u2019s work is of particular value \u2013 contradictors, data and the tweeted reactions of interested observers such as other EU players.</p> <p>Adjusted for the current switch by the two main parties of what were in 1971 called the pro- and anti-marketeer positions, experiencing the two debates in parallel was by turns instructive, amusing and sobering. Public conscience-wrestling is compelling spectacle, and the sincerity with which views on this fundamental issue were held by many MPs of both generations was palpable. Arguments recurred across decades, sometimes in the same words: about sovereignty, treason/surrender, fisheries (a red herring, said one MP), flight of capital, government propaganda, Europe\u2019s negotiators, free movement, and effects on the younger generation and on resident non-UK citizens. Northern Ireland appeared in both debates, despite the changed context. A small news item, by chance on the same page as the parliamentary reports on 29 October 1971, resounds discomfortingly today: \u201cAn Irish army officer pointed his sub-machine gun at a British officer during a 90-minute border confrontation yesterday, demanding that he hand over explosives planted to blow up a bridge in disputed territory at Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh. The British withdrew after consulting maps.\u201d</p> <p>Amid the dross and inevitable repetition was some fine speech-making, some of it multi-purpose and time-proof, such as this from 1971\u2019s secretary of state for employment, Robert Carr. In needling Labour over its attempt to whip obedience to its changed position on Europe, he said: \u201cAn occasional revelation, a single journey to Damascus, is respectable, but when a whole party goes in for a package tour the gullibility of onlookers is strained beyond endurance.\u201d</p> <p>Much of Heath\u2019s 1971 statement anticipating joining could readily serve Boris Johnson soon if he manages to leave: \u201cNow we stand ready to take our first step into a new world full of new opportunities \u2026 Let us show ourselves to that new world as we would wish it to see us \u2013 confident, proud and strong.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Chadwick is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor</p>",

Labour whipped its MPs to vote against; 90 rebelled, and the motion passed 356 to 244. Recriminations swiftly followed. The House of Lords approved by 451 to 58 as \u201cbrother passed brother in the Labour party on the way to the lobbies with none of the acrimony of their Commons counterparts\u201d, reported the Guardian. The project put me in parallel yet weirdly similar worlds. Early mornings and lunchtimes I read the 1971 Hansard and Guardian coverage, and in the evenings I watched today\u2019s UK parliamentarians and followed the Guardian coverage. A connection across the years was Jacob Rees-Mogg because his suits and oratorical style brought to mind the older members of the House of Commons of 1971, and his frontbench lounging recalled the great comic actor Jacques Tati\u2019s character Monsieur Hulot. More on eerie similarities later. The result of the journalism comparison favoured today\u2019s Guardian, but not because the reporting and commentary of 48 years ago were inferior. On the contrary: for example, the reporters\u2019 compression of a large number of the speeches was superb. The commentary was as robust then as now. Leader writers in 1971 and last week both reached for variations on \u201cEurophobia\u201d; only the sufferers have changed. Compared with the paper of old, striking differences were the immediacy, variety of voices and richness of content enabled by digital technologies, both for coverage on screens \u2013 desk, iPad and smartphone \u2013 and in the tabloid-size newspaper. In 1971 and 2019 the Guardian recorded who voted how, but today\u2019s coloured, elegant graphics make the information much more digestible. While contemporary coverage prefers short \u201cpull quotes\u201d rather than summaries of an MP\u2019s whole argument, readers today have within easy reach a livestream, short videos, the MP\u2019s own social media presences and perhaps a podcast interview too. The most powerful element in the comparison was the politics live blog. Almost in real time, contributions to the debate are reported now in a kind of telegraphic way, a snippet or chunk at a time, with hyperlinks to explanatory material \u2013 the parliamentary library\u2019s work is of particular value \u2013 contradictors, data and the tweeted reactions of interested observers such as other EU players. Adjusted for the current switch by the two main parties of what were in 1971 called the pro- and anti-marketeer positions, experiencing the two debates in parallel was by turns instructive, amusing and sobering. Public conscience-wrestling is compelling spectacle, and the sincerity with which views on this fundamental issue were held by many MPs of both generations was palpable. Arguments recurred across decades, sometimes in the same words: about sovereignty, treason/surrender, fisheries (a red herring, said one MP), flight of capital, government propaganda, Europe\u2019s negotiators, free movement, and effects on the younger generation and on resident non-UK citizens. Northern Ireland appeared in both debates, despite the changed context. A small news item, by chance on the same page as the parliamentary reports on 29 October 1971, resounds discomfortingly today: \u201cAn Irish army officer pointed his sub-machine gun at a British officer during a 90-minute border confrontation yesterday, demanding that he hand over explosives planted to blow up a bridge in disputed territory at Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh. The British withdrew after consulting maps.\u201d Amid the dross and inevitable repetition was some fine speech-making, some of it multi-purpose and time-proof, such as this from 1971\u2019s secretary of state for employment, Robert Carr. In needling Labour over its attempt to whip obedience to its changed position on Europe, he said: \u201cAn occasional revelation, a single journey to Damascus, is respectable, but when a whole party goes in for a package tour the gullibility of onlookers is strained beyond endurance.\u201d Much of Heath\u2019s 1971 statement anticipating joining could readily serve Boris Johnson soon if he manages to leave: \u201cNow we stand ready to take our first step into a new world full of new opportunities \u2026 Let us show ourselves to that new world as we would wish it to see us \u2013 confident, proud and strong.\u201d \u2022 Paul Chadwick is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor",

In front of a sold-out Gabba, Martin was at his imposing best. There was nothing he couldn\u2019t get past with a shove, a smirk and a foot on the gas on his way to equalling a career-best haul of six goals.</p> <p>But as good as Martin was up forward, so was Dylan Grimes down back. Two weeks after Lions supporters accused Grimes of everything bar trying to strangle Charlie Cameron with piano wire, the All-Australian defender scrupulously outplayed the All-Australian forward, outmuscling and outthinking him in one-on-ones all while playing a leading role in Richmond\u2019s team defence (emphasis on leading role given his altercation with Eric Hipwood that reversed a free kick to Cameron 30-metres out from goal). By night\u2019s end, Cameron had just 1.2 from seven possessions and you didn\u2019t need to be a Chris Scott-level curmudgeon to dismiss his influence on the game.</p> <p>But it is worth remembering that Cameron was part of a Lions team that had not featured in a final for ten years against a Richmond side of which three-in-four had premiership experience. With that experience comes those intangibles such as pressure \u2013 applying it and performing under it \u2013 that are invaluable in big games.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the game on pure numbers \u2013 and I know you can\u2019t just look at the game on pure numbers \u2013 but gee, we won a lot of things tonight,\u201d said Brisbane coach Chris Fagan with a resigned laugh after the game. \u201cThese boys are playing in big games for the first time\u2026 Sometimes you\u2019ve just got to stick with them and let them work their way through it, so I wouldn\u2019t make any big predictions on that one.\u201d</p> <p>Geelong have plenty to work through. The Cats have now played in 13 finals since they won the 2011 premiership, and after their loss to Collingwood on Friday night, they\u2019ve lost ten of them. If their recent finals history weighed heavily on them before Friday night, it now sinks their shoulders and caves in their chest.</p> <p>Geelong coach Chris Scott is not one to dwell in the past \u2013 and those who cannot remember the past are condemned to replace their ruckman with Sam Menegola in a final against the best big man in the AFL (who subsequently finished with 48 hit-outs, 21 possessions and seven clearances). This isn\u2019t to say that this was the decision that cost Geelong the game \u2013 although it was one that you, me, your roommate and even the Mormon Tabernacle Choir knew to be a stupid one \u2013 just that it was emblematic of the shambolic football they put up in front of more than 93,000 at the MCG. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/07/afl-colours-clash-leaves-collingwood-geelong-fans-fuming\">AFL colours clash leaves Collingwood-Geelong fans fuming</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harry Taylor running into teammates, Tom Hawkins missing from ten yards out, and Gary Ablett dropping simple marks \u2013 this was not quite your Geelong of ten years ago.</p> <p>A scrap such as this brought the class of Scott Pendlebury into relief. On Friday night the Collingwood midfielder celebrated his 300 h game with a goal late in the third quarter with his 18th effective disposal \u2013 four more than anyone else on the ground. There are moments where Pendlebury\u2019s game is of such surpassing beauty his football card should be scented.</p> <p>Steele Sidebottom too provided the Pies with a touch of class \u2013 particularly after half-time \u2013 on his way to 33 disposals and 15 marks. For Geelong, only Patrick Dangerfield could be mentioned in the same conversation.</p> <p>The Pies are now guaranteed a home preliminary final against an interstate rival (either Brisbane or Greater Western Sydney, who were again at their inconsistent best in blowing the doors off the Western Bulldogs on Saturday afternoon). They will likely need to navigate their next two games without Jordan De Goey, who\u2019s season is hanging by a hamstring thread. \u201cThe scan revealed a strain but how quickly he recovers remains to be seen. We have to keep winning, obviously, but there is still hope that Jordy can re-appear in 2019,\u201d said Collingwood football manager Geoff Walsh.</p> <p>Geelong will re-appear in 2019 but it\u2019s increasingly likely that it may only be for another week, when they\u2019ll face West Coast at a ground that holds no fears for the visitors (the Eagles). West Coast opened the 2019 finals with a 55-point thumping of Essendon, whose finals drought will now extend beyond 15 years. </p> <p>For a team whose premiership was last year built largely on defence, this year\u2019s Eagles are beginning to flex their attacking muscles. While Josh Kennedy and Jamie Cripps kicked four goals apiece, it was the games of Liam Ryan and Willie Rioli that will be giving Geelong defenders sleepless nights \u2013 even if Ryan\u2019s three goals may not meet Chris Scott\u2019s measure of \u201cinfluential\u201d. These Eagles have found some gears.</p>",

But as good as Martin was up forward, so was Dylan Grimes down back. Two weeks after Lions supporters accused Grimes of everything bar trying to strangle Charlie Cameron with piano wire, the All-Australian defender scrupulously outplayed the All-Australian forward, outmuscling and outthinking him in one-on-ones all while playing a leading role in Richmond\u2019s team defence (emphasis on leading role given his altercation with Eric Hipwood that reversed a free kick to Cameron 30-metres out from goal). By night\u2019s end, Cameron had just 1.2 from seven possessions and you didn\u2019t need to be a Chris Scott-level curmudgeon to dismiss his influence on the game. But it is worth remembering that Cameron was part of a Lions team that had not featured in a final for ten years against a Richmond side of which three-in-four had premiership experience. With that experience comes those intangibles such as pressure \u2013 applying it and performing under it \u2013 that are invaluable in big games. \u201cIf you look at the game on pure numbers \u2013 and I know you can\u2019t just look at the game on pure numbers \u2013 but gee, we won a lot of things tonight,\u201d said Brisbane coach Chris Fagan with a resigned laugh after the game. \u201cThese boys are playing in big games for the first time\u2026 Sometimes you\u2019ve just got to stick with them and let them work their way through it, so I wouldn\u2019t make any big predictions on that one.\u201d Geelong have plenty to work through. The Cats have now played in 13 finals since they won the 2011 premiership, and after their loss to Collingwood on Friday night, they\u2019ve lost ten of them. If their recent finals history weighed heavily on them before Friday night, it now sinks their shoulders and caves in their chest. Geelong coach Chris Scott is not one to dwell in the past \u2013 and those who cannot remember the past are condemned to replace their ruckman with Sam Menegola in a final against the best big man in the AFL (who subsequently finished with 48 hit-outs, 21 possessions and seven clearances). This isn\u2019t to say that this was the decision that cost Geelong the game \u2013 although it was one that you, me, your roommate and even the Mormon Tabernacle Choir knew to be a stupid one \u2013 just that it was emblematic of the shambolic football they put up in front of more than 93,000 at the MCG. Harry Taylor running into teammates, Tom Hawkins missing from ten yards out, and Gary Ablett dropping simple marks \u2013 this was not quite your Geelong of ten years ago. A scrap such as this brought the class of Scott Pendlebury into relief. On Friday night the Collingwood midfielder celebrated his 300 h game with a goal late in the third quarter with his 18th effective disposal \u2013 four more than anyone else on the ground. There are moments where Pendlebury\u2019s game is of such surpassing beauty his football card should be scented. Steele Sidebottom too provided the Pies with a touch of class \u2013 particularly after half-time \u2013 on his way to 33 disposals and 15 marks. For Geelong, only Patrick Dangerfield could be mentioned in the same conversation. The Pies are now guaranteed a home preliminary final against an interstate rival (either Brisbane or Greater Western Sydney, who were again at their inconsistent best in blowing the doors off the Western Bulldogs on Saturday afternoon). They will likely need to navigate their next two games without Jordan De Goey, who\u2019s season is hanging by a hamstring thread. \u201cThe scan revealed a strain but how quickly he recovers remains to be seen. We have to keep winning, obviously, but there is still hope that Jordy can re-appear in 2019,\u201d said Collingwood football manager Geoff Walsh. Geelong will re-appear in 2019 but it\u2019s increasingly likely that it may only be for another week, when they\u2019ll face West Coast at a ground that holds no fears for the visitors (the Eagles). West Coast opened the 2019 finals with a 55-point thumping of Essendon, whose finals drought will now extend beyond 15 years. For a team whose premiership was last year built largely on defence, this year\u2019s Eagles are beginning to flex their attacking muscles. While Josh Kennedy and Jamie Cripps kicked four goals apiece, it was the games of Liam Ryan and Willie Rioli that will be giving Geelong defenders sleepless nights \u2013 even if Ryan\u2019s three goals may not meet Chris Scott\u2019s measure of \u201cinfluential\u201d. These Eagles have found some gears.",

Donations to the government of the Bahamas The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency has instructions for how to donate money directly to the government of the Bahamas. HeadKnowles Hurricane Relief HeadKnowles was founded by two friends in 2015 to raise money for disaster relief after Hurricane Joaquin. Since then, Lia Head-Rigby and Gina Knowles, two Bahamians living in the United States, have continued to coordinate donations for disaster relief after multiple hurricanes. The group has currently raised more than $1m on GoFundMe to help Dorian survivors. HeadKnowles has been endorsed as a trustworthy NGO by the founding director of the National Art Gallery of the Bahamas, and its leaders are cited as local relief experts in news reports. GoFundMe also has a dedicated page of other \u201cverified\u201d crowdfunding campaigns to help those affected by Dorian. Grand Bahama Disaster Relief Foundation The foundation was formed by the Grand Bahama Port Authority. American citizens can make tax-deductible donations to the foundation through the Coastal Community Foundation of South Carolina, which pledges to send 100% of all donations to Grand Bahama. Salvation Army Minnis has reportedly encouraged donors to give to the Salvation Army, which is working closely with the Bahamian government. Miami Herald\u2019s Operation Helping Hands Miami, Florida, is just a short distance from the Bahamas, and many local organizations have been coordinating aid to Dorian survivors, including the Miami Herald, the region\u2019s most prominent newspaper. The news organization pledges that 100% of funds raised \u201cwill go directly to help people affected by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas and other affected areas\u201d. 30+ other organizations vetted by Charity Navigator Charity Navigator, a group that vets American philanthropic groups, has a list of dozens of organizations in the Bahamas and in the United States that is says are highly rated and able to provide relief to Dorian survivors. The charities on this list \u201chave pre-positioned resources to deliver food, emergency shelter, medical care, and other critical items to people impacted by this storm\u201d and Charity Navigator \u201chas confirmed these charities\u2019 efforts on the ground\u201d, the group said.",

There was some admirable graft from most of the England players that triggered hope among the optimists. But there was no miracle. At 6.15pm Australia won the Test by 185 runs and thereby retained the Ashes. Mission accomplished for Justin Langer, Tim Paine and their team. Now they turn their attention to gleaning more points in the World Test Championship. That is all England can do as well.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/sep/08/ashes-2019-england-v-australia-fourth-test-day-five-live\">Ashes 2019: England v Australia fourth Test, day five \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>England were worn down by the persistence and skill of one of Australia\u2019s best attacks. The best of them was Pat Cummins. But for the stupendous feats of Steve Smith he would be the obvious pick as the man of the series. He is the only one of Australia\u2019s pacemen to play in every Test and it is easy to understand why. He has hardly bowled a poor spell. Beset by injuries in his youth, when he was branded the best-paid student in the country (Cricket Australia had already put him on a central contract) he is now a man mountain, solid as a rock physically and temperamentally.</p> \n<p>Cummins bowled the decisive over of the match on Saturday night when he dismissed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/07/england-need-ashes-miracle-rory-burns-joe-root-australia-cricket\" title=\"\">Rory Burns and Joe Root with successive deliveries</a>. On Sunday morning he was the man to set the ball rolling for the Australians when dismissing Jason Roy and Ben Stokes in his second spell. He has 24 wickets in the series, five more than his nearest rival, Stuart Broad, and he has been miserly as well.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e6c622abb369bf0fe98c43468c46c1d6327234e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e6c622abb369bf0fe98c43468c46c1d6327234e/0_159_4030_2418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Roy is clean bowled by Pat Cummins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Roy is clean bowled by Pat Cummins.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But even Cummins had to wait for an hour and 20 minutes before separating the overnight batsmen. Roy steeled himself to play a knock appropriate to the situation, covering his stumps, pushing forward and almost smelling the ball as he blocked full-length deliveries that he might well have stroked to the boundary in an ODI. Less surprisingly, Joe Denly sidled back and across before defending with the straightest of bats. Against Lyon he employed the slog sweep regularly and usually middled the ball. Both batsmen enhanced their modest reputations as Test batsmen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/08/joe-root-england-australia-ashes-fourth-test\">England\u2019s Joe Root \u2013 \u2018When you lose, it hurts. I have to take that on the chin\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Then Cummins propelled another in-ducker that beat the inside edge of Roy\u2019s bat before demolishing his stumps. Stokes emerged determined to defend stoically, which he managed for 16 balls, a caged lion. To his 17th he made a late decision to withdraw his bat against Cummins, too late since the ball brushed the toe of the blade, which prompted Stokes to walk off without waiting for any decision from umpire Marais Erasmus.</p> \n<p>After lunch Denly reached his third Test half-century but soon after gloved a turning delivery to short-leg off Lyon. Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler hinted at something substantial until the first ball after a drinks interval. Mitchell Starc had been recalled after the batsmen had been lulled by a few overs from Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne. His first ball thudded into the pads and Bairstow had to go.</p> \n<p>Now Craig Overton dug in alongside Buttler; he was given lbw but survived after an agonisingly long review. Together they batted another 15 overs until the tea interval when England were 166 for six. By now there had been a ball change and the replacement seemed more prone to move. Six overs into the final session Buttler fell, bowled playing no shot to a fine delivery from Hazlewood that jagged back on to the off stump. Buttler has batted with much self-denial in this series and this has been his most productive Test so far but it would be a relief to see him bat with freedom before the series is out.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"19f3aa13-0755-4d17-9345-1eccd5f0a5ac\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-n536V03V0A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jofra Archer fell in the next over, lbw to a scooter from Lyon, and the game was surely up. Now there was another change to the batting order. Out came Jack Leach rather than Stuart Broad and the ploy was a limited success. The bespectacled left-hander dug in alongside his Somerset teammate; he dealt with the second new ball with considerable aplomb and an enthralled crowd cheered the completion of every over. Leach survived for 15 overs; he had played Lyon with such composure that Tim Paine tossed the ball to Labuschagne. A leg-break gripped and was punched to short-leg by Leach.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/08/england-individual-heroics-australia-potency\">England find individual heroics are no match for Australia\u2019s potency | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>England had made it to the last hour but no further. Two overs later Overton, who battled away for 105 deliveries, was lbw, half-forward to Hazlewood and his review was futile. The Australians celebrated joyously and with good reason. It had been a hard slog; the Headingley match represented an almighty blow to the solar plexus. But they never fell into the trap of feeling sorry for themselves; they kept their resolve superbly and had thoroughly outplayed England in yet another gripping Test match.</p> \n<p>Obviously Smith and Cummins have been the key architects of this victory and the retention of the Ashes. But kudos must also go to Paine. As captain he carries the can when it all goes wrong. In this series he was given flak whenever England escaped or he failed with the bat; but he has remained calm except for a few dizzy DRS moments; his team has busted guts throughout; the fielders were always effervescent and clung on to most of the catches that came their way. The pace bowlers were unrelenting. And it was quite a good idea to toss the ball to Labuschagne when Leach was digging in. Moreover Paine\u2019s side has been aggressive throughout without ever crossing that much-discussed line. Australia have been the better team.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8295bab0-456a-415d-b707-c5fd86145f99\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>1) Lack of preparation</b></p>\n    <p>Both teams got their preferred prize this summer: England won the World Cup, Australia the Ashes.

      "bodyText": "They came in their thousands hoping for more miracles. The trouble is that this England side is starting to depend on miracles, which is rarely a fruitful state of affairs. There was some admirable graft from most of the England players that triggered hope among the optimists. But there was no miracle. At 6.15pm Australia won the Test by 185 runs and thereby retained the Ashes. Mission accomplished for Justin Langer, Tim Paine and their team. Now they turn their attention to gleaning more points in the World Test Championship. That is all England can do as well. England were worn down by the persistence and skill of one of Australia\u2019s best attacks. The best of them was Pat Cummins. But for the stupendous feats of Steve Smith he would be the obvious pick as the man of the series. He is the only one of Australia\u2019s pacemen to play in every Test and it is easy to understand why. He has hardly bowled a poor spell. Beset by injuries in his youth, when he was branded the best-paid student in the country (Cricket Australia had already put him on a central contract) he is now a man mountain, solid as a rock physically and temperamentally. Cummins bowled the decisive over of the match on Saturday night when he dismissed Rory Burns and Joe Root with successive deliveries. On Sunday morning he was the man to set the ball rolling for the Australians when dismissing Jason Roy and Ben Stokes in his second spell. He has 24 wickets in the series, five more than his nearest rival, Stuart Broad, and he has been miserly as well. But even Cummins had to wait for an hour and 20 minutes before separating the overnight batsmen. Roy steeled himself to play a knock appropriate to the situation, covering his stumps, pushing forward and almost smelling the ball as he blocked full-length deliveries that he might well have stroked to the boundary in an ODI. Less surprisingly, Joe Denly sidled back and across before defending with the straightest of bats. Against Lyon he employed the slog sweep regularly and usually middled the ball. Both batsmen enhanced their modest reputations as Test batsmen. Then Cummins propelled another in-ducker that beat the inside edge of Roy\u2019s bat before demolishing his stumps. Stokes emerged determined to defend stoically, which he managed for 16 balls, a caged lion. To his 17th he made a late decision to withdraw his bat against Cummins, too late since the ball brushed the toe of the blade, which prompted Stokes to walk off without waiting for any decision from umpire Marais Erasmus. After lunch Denly reached his third Test half-century but soon after gloved a turning delivery to short-leg off Lyon. Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler hinted at something substantial until the first ball after a drinks interval. Mitchell Starc had been recalled after the batsmen had been lulled by a few overs from Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne. His first ball thudded into the pads and Bairstow had to go. Now Craig Overton dug in alongside Buttler; he was given lbw but survived after an agonisingly long review. Together they batted another 15 overs until the tea interval when England were 166 for six. By now there had been a ball change and the replacement seemed more prone to move. Six overs into the final session Buttler fell, bowled playing no shot to a fine delivery from Hazlewood that jagged back on to the off stump. Buttler has batted with much self-denial in this series and this has been his most productive Test so far but it would be a relief to see him bat with freedom before the series is out. Jofra Archer fell in the next over, lbw to a scooter from Lyon, and the game was surely up. Now there was another change to the batting order. Out came Jack Leach rather than Stuart Broad and the ploy was a limited success. The bespectacled left-hander dug in alongside his Somerset teammate; he dealt with the second new ball with considerable aplomb and an enthralled crowd cheered the completion of every over. Leach survived for 15 overs; he had played Lyon with such composure that Tim Paine tossed the ball to Labuschagne. A leg-break gripped and was punched to short-leg by Leach. England had made it to the last hour but no further. Two overs later Overton, who battled away for 105 deliveries, was lbw, half-forward to Hazlewood and his review was futile. The Australians celebrated joyously and with good reason. It had been a hard slog; the Headingley match represented an almighty blow to the solar plexus. But they never fell into the trap of feeling sorry for themselves; they kept their resolve superbly and had thoroughly outplayed England in yet another gripping Test match. Obviously Smith and Cummins have been the key architects of this victory and the retention of the Ashes. But kudos must also go to Paine. As captain he carries the can when it all goes wrong. In this series he was given flak whenever England escaped or he failed with the bat; but he has remained calm except for a few dizzy DRS moments; his team has busted guts throughout; the fielders were always effervescent and clung on to most of the catches that came their way. The pace bowlers were unrelenting. And it was quite a good idea to toss the ball to Labuschagne when Leach was digging in. Moreover Paine\u2019s side has been aggressive throughout without ever crossing that much-discussed line. Australia have been the better team.",

Sanford did not hesitate. He said: \u201cI have, and I planned to announce that back home this week. We had a hurricane come visit us on the coast of South Carolina so that sort of disrupted plans on that front, but I\u2019m here to tell you now that I am going to get in.\u201d Wallace sought definitive clarity. \u201cYou\u2019re going to run for president against Donald Trump in the Republican race?\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI am, I am,\u201d Sanford said. Wallace then asked Sanford why he was running. Sanford replied: \u201cI think we need to have a conversation on what it means to be a Republican.\u201d Sanford later said: \u201cWe have lost our way on debt and deficits and spending. The president has called himself the king of debt.\u201d He said that Trump\u2019s attitude toward debt, \u201cI think, is ultimately leading us into the wrong direction\u201d. Wallace responded: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know you basically have no chance of winning the Republican nomination. So why run for president?\u201d Sanford said: \u201cI think you probably would have said that same thing to Donald Trump just a matter of months ago if he faced the likes of Jeb Bush and others.\u201d",

After a lot of pushing by Fiona Bruce on last Thursday\u2019s Question Time (The three questions that will decide the next election, 7 September), Emily Thornberry said Labour\u2019s position is as follows. When Labour wins the general election they will go to Brussels and negotiate a better deal than the one currently on the table. When that negotiation is completed they will come back to Westminster and campaign against that deal. They then hope to hold another referendum, giving a choice of the deal they negotiated or remain.

      "body": "<p>When Jesy Nelson was 19 and working behind the bar at a pub in Dagenham, Essex, she remembers watching The X Factor on TV, and thinking: \u201cI know I could win that.\u201d In 2011, she did just that, as part of the girl group Little Mix \u2013 and thought: \u201cThis is the worst day of my life.\u201d</p> <p>Competing in Simon Cowell\u2019s singing contest unleashed ceaseless criticism of her appearance and weight (although rarely her voice). \u201cAll I cared about was what people were saying about me,\u201d she says now.</p> <p>Winning offered no respite. When Little Mix were crowned, the first Facebook message she saw was from a stranger. It read: \u201cYou are the ugliest thing I have ever seen in my life. You do not deserve to be in this girl band, you deserve to die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should have been on cloud nine,\u201d she says. \u201cI had Leigh-Anne [Pinnock, also of Little Mix] in my room being like: \u2018This is the best!\u2019 and I was like: \u2018No, this isn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Little Mix went on to become the biggest British girl group since the Spice Girls, but Nelson was consumed by the trolling and abuse on social media. Within two years of the finale, she had depression and an eating disorder and had attempted suicide.</p> <p>The downward spiral and her eventual, slow recovery are the focus of an intensely personal BBC Three documentary, Jesy Nelson: Odd One Out. Before shooting it, she says, she had never spoken publicly about her struggles in the spotlight. </p> <p>When we meet in a corner of BBC Broadcasting House in central London, Nelson, now 28, is friendly and glamorous, dressed in a double-breasted tangerine suit. It is the eighth anniversary of her X Factor debut and #8YearsofLittleMix has been trending on Twitter all morning, thanks to their fans, the \u201cMixers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df06377a8733148286fbe546f4b0629e9ac0d2d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df06377a8733148286fbe546f4b0629e9ac0d2d2/0_146_4072_2443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On The X Factor in 2011: (from left) Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On The X Factor in 2011: (from left) Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/Talkback Thames/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within minutes of sitting down, she says that, had she known the consequences of appearing on The X Factor, she wouldn\u2019t have done it: \u201cI don\u2019t think anything is worth your happiness, and it was a lot of my life that I won\u2019t get back.\u201d</p> <p>As a child growing up in Romford, Essex, Nelson was intent on becoming a performer, be it singing, dancing or acting. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have any reason to not be confident,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In mid-2011, she auditioned for The X Factor as a solo entrant, and was eventually placed in a group with three others: Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall, all aged between 18 and 20.</p> <p>Back then, social media was not as inextricably linked with reality TV as it is now. In fact, that eighth series was the first where applicants could upload their audition videos to YouTube; Nelson didn\u2019t even know what YouTube was. She remembers being wowed when all the contestants were given new Samsung phones and told to get on Twitter to build their fanbase. </p> <p>On the first live show 12 weeks in, Little Mix (then Rhythmix \u2013 the name was changed later) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rAGQ6x6bojA?t=1219\" title=\"\">performed Nicki Minaj\u2019s Super Bass</a> to gushing praise from judges Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and their mentor Tulisa Contostavlos. It was \u201cthe best feeling in the world\u201d, said Nelson through happy tears on stage.</p> <p>That night, off-camera, the contestants gathered to watch themselves on YouTube. Someone pointed out the comment section. \u201cI was very naive,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cI thought it would be people giving their opinion on our performance. But nearly every comment was about the way I looked: \u2018She\u2019s a fat ugly rat\u2019; \u2018How has she got in this girl group?\u2019; \u2018How is the fat one in this?\u2019\u201d She remembers the air being thick with tension \u2013 \u201cbecause no one knew what to do or how to react\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI felt a rush of anxiety, because I\u2019d never experienced anything like that in my life. People were saying my face was deformed \u2013 just the most horrific things. I felt like I was heartbroken. I remember ringing my mum and saying: \u2018Mum, I want to go home, I don\u2019t want to do it.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9cfe3d288b28d2d9649fe549a64c2b28a7012627\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cfe3d288b28d2d9649fe549a64c2b28a7012627/0_0_4285_2858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jesy Nelson with Liz Ritchie in the forthcoming BBC documentary Odd One Out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesy Nelson with Liz Ritchie in the forthcoming BBC documentary Odd One Out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rahul Bhatt/BBC/October Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At about 1am, a member of The X Factor team found Nelson crying alone and asked why she was so upset. A couple of days later, she was asked to explain again \u2013 on camera. She didn\u2019t want to do it. \u201cThey told me it wasn\u2019t recorded, and it was.\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks later, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/s-ZoE4qN0xs?t=3759\" title=\"\">the clip of Nelson</a> in tears over \u201ca few nasty comments\u201d was broadcast before Little Mix\u2019s performance, the reality TV playbook of \u201csad piano\u201d switching to upbeat pop music when Thirlwall comforts her: an uplifting moment of girl power. From then on, that was Nelson\u2019s public narrative.</p> <p>She does not hold that clip, or the producers, responsible: \u201cI think it would have always happened \u2013 that just added fuel to the fire.\u201d From the start, relatability had been billed as a central tenet of Little Mix\u2019s appeal. Contostavlos introduced them as \u201cthe girl group to represent ladies in this country\u201d; she framed Nelson\u2019s tears as evidence of Little Mix having \u201cthe same insecurities as every other girl\u201d.</p> <p>Nelson, however, was the only member even remotely close to the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/womens-body-changes-since-1957-self-image-fashion-weight-health-sizes-positive-a7633036.html\" title=\"\">average UK woman at size 16</a>. Although the four bandmates have always been friends \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s why we\u2019re still together\u201d \u2013 she felt singled out. \u201cI was with three other girls to be compared to. I don\u2019t think it would have been as bad if I\u2019d been on my own.\u201d</p> <p>After the clip presented her as Little Mix\u2019s weakest link, the abuse snowballed. \u201cIt was like as soon as people knew that it was really affecting me, they wanted to do it more.\u201d Nelson had been bullied at school, to the point of stress-induced alopecia \u2013 \u201cbut this wasn\u2019t playground stuff\u201d.</p> <p>She was shocked by the cruelty from adults \u2013 some clearly parents. \u201cObviously everyone sits in their living room and will see someone on TV and make a comment. But to actually pick up your phone and go: \u2018I\u2019m going to make sure this girl sees it\u2019 \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t think I was going to see it \u2013 you have no idea the effect that one comment will have.\u201d</p> <p>Nelson became \u201cobsessed\u201d with reading criticism. The praise didn\u2019t register. \u201cIt only got worse when I got Twitter. And that led to the Daily Mail, and reading the [below the line] comments \u2013 the worst you can read about yourself. It was like I purposely wanted to hurt myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had a routine of waking up, going on Twitter, searching for the worst things I could about myself. I\u2019d type in the search bar: \u2018Jesy fat\u2019, or \u2018Jesy ugly\u2019, and see what would come up. Sometimes I didn\u2019t even need to do that, I\u2019d just write \u2018Jesy\u2019 and then I\u2019d see all the horrible things. Everyone told me to ignore it \u2013 but it was like an addiction.\u201d</p> <p>At one event, Nicola Roberts of Girls Aloud \u2013 who had seen the clip of her crying \u2013 took Nelson aside. \u201cShe said: \u2018Can I just give you one bit of advice?

I\u2019d be in live Q&amp;As and these things would pop up and I\u2019d have to just sit there.\u201d</p> <p>Interviewers asked her how she dealt with it; fans said they looked up to her. She was depressed and in denial: she refused antidepressants, and therapy didn\u2019t help. \u201cOur schedule was so gruelling. I was going to see a therapist at six o\u2019clock in the morning, crying, and then going to a photoshoot.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in public, she was \u201cgiving speeches about being confident\u201d.

On one magazine shoot, the wrong size clothes were provided. \u201cI had a meltdown. I cried so much, I had to wear sunglasses. I did one photo, then left.\u201d She hid her misery well, she says now. \u201cI think people just thought I was a miserable bitch.\u201d</p> <p>Her lowest point was in the lead-up to Little Mix\u2019s second album, Salute, in 2013. Her mum, Janice, increasingly desperate, told her she had to quit the band. Yet Nelson worried that leaving \u2013 or even taking a break \u2013 would draw more attention to herself. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to ask why.\u201d</p> <p>In November 2013, Little Mix returned to The X Factor to perform their new single, Nelson notably slimmed down. Coverage centred on one tweet from <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/11/04/little-mix-katie-hopkins-x-factor_n_4213039.html\" title=\"\">Katie Hopkins</a>: \u201cPacket Mix have still got a chubber in their ranks. Less Little Mix. More Pick n Mix.\u201d</p> <p>Increasingly, Nelson felt trapped. \u201cI felt that I physically couldn\u2019t tolerate the pain any more.\u201d She attempted suicide.</p> <p>Nelson\u2019s family, her management and the rest of the group knew \u2013 but \u201conce it was spoken about, it wasn\u2019t ever spoken about again\u201d, she says. She was offered time off, but once more was too frightened of drawing attention to herself to take it.</p> <p>The turning point came in February 2014, when Little Mix spent six weeks travelling across North America, opening for Demi Lovato. One day, on the bus, the dancers pulled her aside and told her she had to quit Twitter, likening it to a book filled with \u201cloads of nasty things\u201d that Nelson always had her nose in. She finally deleted her account.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a long, hard process, because I didn\u2019t want to help myself. But it wasn\u2019t until I deleted Twitter that everything changed for me and I slowly started to feel normal again.\u201d Through more regular therapy and talking to friends and family, eventually she was able to stop reading articles about herself, and distance herself from her public image even as Little Mix\u2019s star continued to climb. In 2016, Glory Days became their first No 1 album in the UK.</p> <p>Since February, Nelson has been dating the 2017 Love Island contestant Chris Hughes, who has defended her publicly from online trolling and who she says is a positive influence on her feelings about fame: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be around someone who doesn\u2019t give a shit about all that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Making the documentary also contributed; she lights up while talking about meeting a body-image specialist, Liz Ritchie, to help her understand her relationship with social media and the \u201cmask\u201d that she had developed to withstand the spotlight. Part of this involved going over footage from The X Factor, which was a difficult experience, but ultimately empowering.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I still have days when I feel shit in myself but instead of beating myself up about it and being miserable, I think: \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to have my moment of being sad, and I\u2019ll be over it.\u2019 Before, I didn\u2019t let myself be sad.\u201d</p> <p>Talking to other young people who have experienced online abuse made her feel less alone. \u201cA lot of people think \u2018stop moaning\u2019, but until you\u2019ve experienced it, it\u2019s hard to understand \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t just happen to people in the limelight. There\u2019s so many people struggling with social media and online trolling. People need to know about the effects it has.\u201d</p> <p>The turnaround in five years, she agrees, is remarkable: now, as Little Mix work on their sixth album, Nelson is less conscious of her weight, her appearance, what she\u2019s eating \u2013 even what is being said about her. To shoot the documentary, she returned to Twitter, and discovered some new slurs. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know some people said that about me, but it\u2019s because I don\u2019t look for it \u2013 and also, I. Don\u2019t. Care,\u201d she says, leaning forward in her chair.</p> <p>\u201cNow I\u2019m mentally a lot happier, I just think people are always going to have an opinion. But I only care about mine.\u201d She flashes a smile from beneath all her hair, happy but defiant \u2013 and for a moment she looks exactly like the girl in the music videos.</p> <p><em>Jesy Nelson: Odd One Out will be available on 12 September from 10am on BBC Three on iPlayer and on BBC One at 9pm.</em></p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is on 0808 2000 247.

      "bodyText": "When Jesy Nelson was 19 and working behind the bar at a pub in Dagenham, Essex, she remembers watching The X Factor on TV, and thinking: \u201cI know I could win that.\u201d In 2011, she did just that, as part of the girl group Little Mix \u2013 and thought: \u201cThis is the worst day of my life.\u201d Competing in Simon Cowell\u2019s singing contest unleashed ceaseless criticism of her appearance and weight (although rarely her voice). \u201cAll I cared about was what people were saying about me,\u201d she says now. Winning offered no respite. When Little Mix were crowned, the first Facebook message she saw was from a stranger. It read: \u201cYou are the ugliest thing I have ever seen in my life. You do not deserve to be in this girl band, you deserve to die.\u201d \u201cI should have been on cloud nine,\u201d she says. \u201cI had Leigh-Anne [Pinnock, also of Little Mix] in my room being like: \u2018This is the best!\u2019 and I was like: \u2018No, this isn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Little Mix went on to become the biggest British girl group since the Spice Girls, but Nelson was consumed by the trolling and abuse on social media. Within two years of the finale, she had depression and an eating disorder and had attempted suicide. The downward spiral and her eventual, slow recovery are the focus of an intensely personal BBC Three documentary, Jesy Nelson: Odd One Out. Before shooting it, she says, she had never spoken publicly about her struggles in the spotlight. When we meet in a corner of BBC Broadcasting House in central London, Nelson, now 28, is friendly and glamorous, dressed in a double-breasted tangerine suit. It is the eighth anniversary of her X Factor debut and #8YearsofLittleMix has been trending on Twitter all morning, thanks to their fans, the \u201cMixers\u201d. Within minutes of sitting down, she says that, had she known the consequences of appearing on The X Factor, she wouldn\u2019t have done it: \u201cI don\u2019t think anything is worth your happiness, and it was a lot of my life that I won\u2019t get back.\u201d As a child growing up in Romford, Essex, Nelson was intent on becoming a performer, be it singing, dancing or acting. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have any reason to not be confident,\u201d she says. In mid-2011, she auditioned for The X Factor as a solo entrant, and was eventually placed in a group with three others: Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall, all aged between 18 and 20. Back then, social media was not as inextricably linked with reality TV as it is now. In fact, that eighth series was the first where applicants could upload their audition videos to YouTube; Nelson didn\u2019t even know what YouTube was. She remembers being wowed when all the contestants were given new Samsung phones and told to get on Twitter to build their fanbase. On the first live show 12 weeks in, Little Mix (then Rhythmix \u2013 the name was changed later) performed Nicki Minaj\u2019s Super Bass to gushing praise from judges Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and their mentor Tulisa Contostavlos. It was \u201cthe best feeling in the world\u201d, said Nelson through happy tears on stage. That night, off-camera, the contestants gathered to watch themselves on YouTube. Someone pointed out the comment section. \u201cI was very naive,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cI thought it would be people giving their opinion on our performance. But nearly every comment was about the way I looked: \u2018She\u2019s a fat ugly rat\u2019; \u2018How has she got in this girl group?\u2019; \u2018How is the fat one in this?\u2019\u201d She remembers the air being thick with tension \u2013 \u201cbecause no one knew what to do or how to react\u201d. \u201cI felt a rush of anxiety, because I\u2019d never experienced anything like that in my life. People were saying my face was deformed \u2013 just the most horrific things. I felt like I was heartbroken. I remember ringing my mum and saying: \u2018Mum, I want to go home, I don\u2019t want to do it.\u2019\u201d At about 1am, a member of The X Factor team found Nelson crying alone and asked why she was so upset. A couple of days later, she was asked to explain again \u2013 on camera. She didn\u2019t want to do it. \u201cThey told me it wasn\u2019t recorded, and it was.\u201d A few weeks later, the clip of Nelson in tears over \u201ca few nasty comments\u201d was broadcast before Little Mix\u2019s performance, the reality TV playbook of \u201csad piano\u201d switching to upbeat pop music when Thirlwall comforts her: an uplifting moment of girl power. From then on, that was Nelson\u2019s public narrative. She does not hold that clip, or the producers, responsible: \u201cI think it would have always happened \u2013 that just added fuel to the fire.\u201d From the start, relatability had been billed as a central tenet of Little Mix\u2019s appeal. Contostavlos introduced them as \u201cthe girl group to represent ladies in this country\u201d; she framed Nelson\u2019s tears as evidence of Little Mix having \u201cthe same insecurities as every other girl\u201d. Nelson, however, was the only member even remotely close to the average UK woman at size 16. Although the four bandmates have always been friends \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s why we\u2019re still together\u201d \u2013 she felt singled out. \u201cI was with three other girls to be compared to. I don\u2019t think it would have been as bad if I\u2019d been on my own.\u201d After the clip presented her as Little Mix\u2019s weakest link, the abuse snowballed. \u201cIt was like as soon as people knew that it was really affecting me, they wanted to do it more.\u201d Nelson had been bullied at school, to the point of stress-induced alopecia \u2013 \u201cbut this wasn\u2019t playground stuff\u201d. She was shocked by the cruelty from adults \u2013 some clearly parents. \u201cObviously everyone sits in their living room and will see someone on TV and make a comment. But to actually pick up your phone and go: \u2018I\u2019m going to make sure this girl sees it\u2019 \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t think I was going to see it \u2013 you have no idea the effect that one comment will have.\u201d Nelson became \u201cobsessed\u201d with reading criticism. The praise didn\u2019t register. \u201cIt only got worse when I got Twitter. And that led to the Daily Mail, and reading the [below the line] comments \u2013 the worst you can read about yourself. It was like I purposely wanted to hurt myself.\u201d \u201cI had a routine of waking up, going on Twitter, searching for the worst things I could about myself. I\u2019d type in the search bar: \u2018Jesy fat\u2019, or \u2018Jesy ugly\u2019, and see what would come up. Sometimes I didn\u2019t even need to do that, I\u2019d just write \u2018Jesy\u2019 and then I\u2019d see all the horrible things. Everyone told me to ignore it \u2013 but it was like an addiction.\u201d At one event, Nicola Roberts of Girls Aloud \u2013 who had seen the clip of her crying \u2013 took Nelson aside. \u201cShe said: \u2018Can I just give you one bit of advice? Please don\u2019t read stuff about you. It\u2019s the worst thing you could do.\u2019\u201d Nelson rolls her eyes self-mockingly. \u201cBut did I listen? No.\u201d Contestants had been told help was available if they were struggling, but Nelson had learned that talking only made the problem worse. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the team really knew how upset it was making me \u2013 it\u2019s just go-go-go, from the car into hair and makeup, then rehearsals.\u201d It was also a popularity contest. \u201cWe just wanted to make everyone happy, and we wanted everyone to like us.\u201d In December 2011, Little Mix became the first group to win The X Factor. Their debut single entered the charts at No 1 seven months later; DNA, their first album, was released in November 2012. Scrutiny of Nelson only increased amid the pressure to maintain momentum. Although she tried not to discuss it, she feels the abuse came to define her public image. \u201cI\u2019d become a bit of a joke. People would make memes, chopping my head off in a group photo and putting a monster or ET on there. I\u2019d be in live Q&amp;As and these things would pop up and I\u2019d have to just sit there.\u201d Interviewers asked her how she dealt with it; fans said they looked up to her. She was depressed and in denial: she refused antidepressants, and therapy didn\u2019t help. \u201cOur schedule was so gruelling.

Coverage centred on one tweet from Katie Hopkins: \u201cPacket Mix have still got a chubber in their ranks. Less Little Mix. More Pick n Mix.\u201d Increasingly, Nelson felt trapped. \u201cI felt that I physically couldn\u2019t tolerate the pain any more.\u201d She attempted suicide. Nelson\u2019s family, her management and the rest of the group knew \u2013 but \u201conce it was spoken about, it wasn\u2019t ever spoken about again\u201d, she says.

The widespread reaction to his death has revealed starkly the divided legacy he leaves behind. From one viewpoint he is Zimbabwe\u2019s founding father, the man who led his comrades through an armed struggle for the liberation of Zimbabwe\u2019s black majority from Rhodesian white-minority rule. His achievements in those early, heady years of independence were exemplary, with emphasis on health, education and women\u2019s empowerment, thus opening up possibilities to many Zimbabweans, particularly the rural poor, who were shut out from Rhodesia\u2019s opportunities.</p> \n<p>From another viewpoint, he is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/hero-turned-tyrant-international-reaction-robert-mugabe-death\" title=\"\">hero who became a villain</a>, his 37-year rule characterised by massive human rights abuses, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/mugabe-zimbabwe-gukurahundi-massacre-matabeleland\" title=\"\">Gukurahundi massacres</a> and persecution of supporters of the rival Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo just after independence, to the persecution of perceived enemies, both in the opposition and within his own party, whom he considered threats to his power.

      "bodyText": "Zimbabwe\u2019s founding leader, Robert Gabriel Mugabe, has died. The widespread reaction to his death has revealed starkly the divided legacy he leaves behind. From one viewpoint he is Zimbabwe\u2019s founding father, the man who led his comrades through an armed struggle for the liberation of Zimbabwe\u2019s black majority from Rhodesian white-minority rule. His achievements in those early, heady years of independence were exemplary, with emphasis on health, education and women\u2019s empowerment, thus opening up possibilities to many Zimbabweans, particularly the rural poor, who were shut out from Rhodesia\u2019s opportunities. From another viewpoint, he is the hero who became a villain, his 37-year rule characterised by massive human rights abuses, from the Gukurahundi massacres and persecution of supporters of the rival Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo just after independence, to the persecution of perceived enemies, both in the opposition and within his own party, whom he considered threats to his power. Even the land reform programme, much admired across Africa for restoring land to its rightful owners, was implemented amid chaos and violence. This reform was meant to empower Zimbabweans, but it also isolated the country and impoverished the very people it was meant to support: swift sanctions soon followed from the west that, together with Mugabe\u2019s own inconsistent economic policies and widespread corruption in his government, plunged the economy into an almost permanent recession for nearly two decades. Mugabe\u2019s legacy will continue to be contested between those who revere him and those who revile him, but what matters most now is how Zimbabwe\u2019s new president handles that legacy. As Emmerson Mnangagwa prepares to bury his predecessor, he must also bury those aspects of the Mugabe presidency that polarised Zimbabweans, and those policies and attitudes that pauperised this once prosperous nation. Mnangagwa has promised that his governance will bring a \u201cnew dispensation\u201d, and has marked his era as that of the Second Republic. But if he is to avoid the fate of France\u2019s Second Republic, in which the first citizen soon became the third emperor, Mnangagwa must bury the imperial presidency along with Mugabe.

After a high-quality and absorbing race, one of the better ones this season, and one that ended in home euphoria with Charles Leclerc recording his second race win in a row for Ferrari, whose fans will be partying for some time after a first home triumph for nine years. (Even if their other contender, Sebastian Vettel, had something of a race from hell). Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton competed well and kept the race interesting to the last, but didn\u2019t have the pace to reel in Leclerc on this occasion. Hamilton is still set fair to retain his world crown though, so needn\u2019t feel downhearted. </p> <p>Stay on the site for reports and reaction, and thanks for following.

So, with the destination of both the drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 titles seemingly a foregone conclusion, we may have to absorb ourselves in subplots and controversies and little individual battles as the season enters the home straight. And we\u2019re getting a few. Take yesterday\u2019s qualifying, when a game of \u201cno, after you, I insist\u201d among slipstream-keen drivers led to go-slows and accusations of blocking.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the upshot of it all was a Ferrari driver in pole for the 90th edition of the Italian grand prix. Monaco\u2019s Charles Leclerc will carry the Scuderia\u2019s hopes of a first success at Monza since 2010 as he looks to consolidate an impressive first campaign for the team and build on his win in Belgium last time out. The pace of the track and the backing of the crowd should stand him in good stead too.</p> <p>But right behind him on the grid is Lewis Hamilton, who has won the past two grands prix at this storied venue, with the world champion\u2019s teammate Valtteri Bottas a place further back. Hamilton can make a sixth world title even more nailed-down with victory today, and he\u2019s 5-4 favourite with the bookies for a reason. Max Verstappen starting at the back of the grid for having taken new engines and components \u2013 along with McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris and Toro Rosso\u2019s Pierre Gasly \u2013 will also be handy for the British driver.</p> <p>Of course motor sport is still reeling from the death of Anthoine Hubert, with Norris <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/05/f1-lando-norris-shaken-death-anthoine-hubert\">speaking in the week</a> about the impact of the Frenchman\u2019s fatal accident last week. Safety will be in the spotlight this afternoon at the quickest track in F1. Hubert, Juan-Manuel Correa whose condition remains critical after the crash at Spa, will be prominent in the thoughts of many this afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Here\u2019s how they line up on the grid:</strong></p> <p>1 Charles Leclerc, Ferrari; 2 Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes; 3 Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes; 4 Sebastian Vettel, Ferrari; 5 Daniel Ricciardo, Renault; 6 Nico Hulkenberg, Renault; 7 Carlos Sainz, McLaren Renault; 8 Alexander Albon, Red Bull; 9 Lance Stroll, Racing Point; 10 Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Alfa Romeo; 11 Antonio Giovinazzi, Alfa Romeo; 12 Kevin Magnussen, Haas; 13 Daniil Kvyat, Toro Rosso; 14 Lando Norris, McLaren Renault; 15 Pierre Gasly, Toro Rosso; 16 Romain Grosjean, Haas; 17 Sergio Perez, Racing Point; 18 George Russell, Williams; 19 Robert Kubica, Williams; 20 Max Verstappen, Red Bull</p> <p><em>Verstappen, Norris and Gasly required to start from back of grid due to multiple power unit element changes.</em></p> <p><strong>Lights out 2.10pm BST</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1a5ac4fac496b028ca360eec9b4856fc4dd1b3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1a5ac4fac496b028ca360eec9b4856fc4dd1b3d/0_0_5472_3536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Leclerc of Ferrari prepares for the race.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Leclerc of Ferrari prepares for the race.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-08T13:29:07.026Z\">at 2.29pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right, well that\u2019s us done for the afternoon. After a high-quality and absorbing race, one of the better ones this season, and one that ended in home euphoria with Charles Leclerc recording his second race win in a row for Ferrari, whose fans will be partying for some time after a first home triumph for nine years. (Even if their other contender, Sebastian Vettel, had something of a race from hell). Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton competed well and kept the race interesting to the last, but didn\u2019t have the pace to reel in Leclerc on this occasion.

Here\u2019s an on-the-flag race report. Giles Richards\u2019s report from Monza to follow: Presentation time: Hamilton ascends the podium, followed by Bottas, and then the volume goes up several more notches as Leclerc comes out to Monza\u2019s acclaim. Monaco\u2019s anthem \u2013 which is a long one \u2013 and then Italy\u2019s ring out. Leclerc speaks: \u201cWhat a race, I\u2019ve never been so tired.\u201d Then he switches to Italian, offering profuse thanks to his supporters. \u201cI made a few mistakes,\u201d he says self-critically, \u201cbut fortunately none of them made me lose position today.\u201d Bottas on Mercedes: \u201cI think we had a good strategy, and some opportunities opened up at the end, and I\u2019m gutted that I couldn\u2019t get past. It was difficult to overtake, we tried everything with our engine modes but yeah, we move on.\u201d And here\u2019s Hamilton, asked if the race was a bit \u201cfruity\u201d by Martin Brundle. \u201cFruity? He did a great job, congratulations to Ferrari and Charles, He did a great job, there was a lot of pressure form Valtteri and I, but my tyres jut went off a cliff. But they were much quicker in the straight lines and it was not our day but we\u2019ve got points for the team and for the constructors\u2019 championship. I\u2019m not [focusing on clinching the world title], just trying to do better in each race and I have a healthier lead at this stage than in the past.\u201d Leclerc is mobbed by his crew, roared on by thousands in the stands who\u2019d like to do likewise. His decision to stay on the hard tyre vindicated, thanks to his impressively calm race management So this is how they\u2019ve finished: 1 Leclerc, 2 Bottas, 3 Hamilton, 4 Ricciardo, 5 Hulkenburg, 6 Albon, 7 Perez, 8 Verstappen, 9 Giovinazzi, 10 Norris. Sebastian Vettel was back in 13th. Lewis Hamilton has picked up the fastest lap, but he wasn\u2019t in this race from just after half way. He\u2019s ended third, but maintains a comfortable championship lead. Today is all about Leclerc there \u2013 what a prospect he is, though even in his moment of triumph he taps his car in acknowledgment of Anthoine Hubert. Lap 53/53: Leclerc holds his nerves, his pace, navigates the braking zones adeptly. Bottas keeps pressing, but it\u2019s not enough. Ferrari have a Monza win for the first time since 2010! Lap 52/53: Leclerc has shown magnificent composure here, it has to be said, and not been afraid to be a little ruthless. He now leads from 1.3sec going into the final lap. Hamilton is third, Ricciardo fourth and Hulkenburg fifth. Lap 51/53: Bottas attacks Leclerc with DRS going into the first two chicanes, but locks up, braking a little too late, and squandering a massive opportunity. Perhaps his last. More cheers. Lap 50/53: Leclerc\u2019s lead is cut slightly, giving Bottas a DRS opportunity. But he goes into the 51st lap with a 0.5sec advantage. Lap 49/53: Daniel Ricciardo merits a mention in fourth, heading for his first top-five finish as a Renault driver. Mercedes\u2019 mechanics are coming out in the pit lane, for Hamilton who comes in for soft tyres. He\u2019s going to finish behind his teammate and surrender some points to him. Lap 48/53: Ferrari are managing their systems well, even while one of their team, Vettel, has had a shocker. He\u2019s marooned back in 14th still. Bottas gains a couple of tenths on Leclerc, but needs more. Lap 47/53: So they stand like this: 1 Leclerc, 2 Bottas, 3 Hamilton, 4 Ricciardo, 5 Hulkenburg, 6 Albon. Leclerc now leads by 1.4sec. Bottas might have missed his chance here. Lap 46/53: \u201cThis is your win,\u201d Leclerc is told by his race engineer over the radio, leading by 1.5secs as they move into the last six laps. The atmosphere is building, as is the tension. Bottas lost a bit of ground on that last lap. Lap 45/53: Bottas\u2019s car has plenty of grip and his tyres look good, but he\u2019s running out of time and needs to gain a bit more on Leclerc than he currently is. The leads is 1.02sec. Verstappen\u2019s charge through the field continues as he moves into eighth. Magnussen has retired from the race. Lap 43/53: Leclerc has just done a personal best lap here, and now has 10 laps to hold his advantage and spark big celebrations. He leads Bottas by 1.6sec Lap 42/53: Leclerc now has a 1.9sec lead from Bottas in second. The Mercedes driver has been gaining ground impressively for the last 15 laps or so, and is now well placed. Hamilton is now more than three and a half seconds off the lead in third. Elsewhere, the hapless Vettel has to pit again. Lap 41/53: Hamilton has reportedly not been given the \u201cup to 11\u201d engine power he\u2019d asked for, and he locks up and is forced into the run-off area at the first engine. He loses second place! A huge cheer goes up. It\u2019s Leclerc\u2019s to lose now, though Bottas is coming on strong. Lap 40/53: Phew. Right, so Leclerc now leads by 0.9sec from Hamilton with Bottas only 1.58sec further back in third. Could he spring a surprise by overhauling both the drivers in front of him? Will Mercedes tell him to go for it? Lap 39/53: Max Verstappen\u2019s put in a fine little performance, give his pre-race handicap and early pit stop. He\u2019s up to ninth. Lando Norris has moved into 10th just behind him. Leclerc is still holding the pace out front. Lap 38/53: Bottas is still gaining ground, now 2.7sec behind Hamilton. Lap 37/53: Hamilton is gaining, only 0.3sec now Lap 36/53: Bottas\u2019s advance raises questions for Mercedes as to whether they\u2019d let the Finn have a go at Leclerc if Hamilton can\u2019t pass him. The Briton is still going hard at Leclerc though, and the race leader will escape punishment for the way he held off Hamilton in the preceding lap on Curva Grande. Lap 35/53: Leclerc locks up going through the chicane, and Hamilton has a go at the Curva Grande, zig-zagging across the track, but he can\u2019t make it, Leclerc blocking him out and retaining the lead, cutting out the corner. Encouragement for Hamilton. The lead is now 0.7sec. Hamilton is unhappy with Leclerc\u2019s tactics. Bottas is also gaining ground in third, 3.3sec behind. Lap 34/53: Hamilton looks as if he\u2019s pondering another attack on Leclerc after the first two chicanes, but can\u2019t quite get past him. \u201cI need more power, man,\u201d he sighs over the radio. Leclerc and his car holding out well at the moment, for all the pressure being exerted. Verstappen passes Magnussen to climb into 10th. Lap 33/53: Leclerc lead is cut to 0.4sec, his teammate Vettel meanwhile is still in the back half of the field, in 11th, and has to accept a blue flag to let the front runners past. And it\u2019s close at the top. Lap 32/53: How they stand: Leclerc leads by 0.7sec from Hamilton, with Bottas a further 5.2sec further back. Ricciardo is fourth, Hulkenburg fifth. Kvyat had been sixth before his withdrawal, which has been attributed to an oil leak. Lap 31/53: Kvyat\u2019s out of the race, engine smouldering at the side of the track. Smoke was seeping out of the engine as he came out of the pit lane and he sputtered to the edge of the road. Lap 30/53: Hamilton comes out of the parabolically strongly, and almost within range of Leclerc after the virtual safety car leaves. But the Monagesque dricver retains his lead. Bottas moves up into third above Ricciardo. Leclerc\u2019s lead is a mere 1.2sec. Lap 29/53: The virtual safety car is out after the Sainz incident. Leclerc still leads from Hamilton. Lap 28/53: Bottas replaces soft tyres with medium tyres as he goes into the pits, which puts Leclerc back in the lead, but Bottas\u2019s tyres might be in better nick come the end of the race. Meanwhile, Sainz\u2019s wheels have come loose as he was coming out of the pits. He\u2019s out of the race, for the second weekend running. Lap 27/53: Hamilton is still within DRS range of Leclerc. Further back, Verstappen has now moved into ninth, with Albon pitting, taking his five-second penalty and returning in 12th. Bottas is coming into the pits. Lap 26/53: Leclerc passes Ricciardo into second, and so does Hamilton on the chicane. So Leclerc and Hamilton are now second and third respectively. But Ricciardo\u2019s not really in this to win it today, but to gain position on Hulkenburg. Lap 25/53: Leclerc has just set the fastest lap of the race on his new compound tyres. \u201cIt\u2019s superfast on the straights,\u201d observes Hamilton. His teammate Bottas still leads, but hasn\u2019t pitted, and might want to push the pace a bit before doing so. Lap 24/53: Leclerc gets a slap on the wrist in the form of a black-and-white flag. He might be relieved by that. \u201cNo action at the moment.\u201d Bottas leads from Ricciardo. Leclerc is a mere 0.7sec ahead of Hamilton. Lap 23/53: Brilliant stuff from Leclerc, who passes Hulkenburg on turns one and two, and then Hamilton comes at him again but is forced onto the gravel, and the crowd goes noisily berserk. This is a serious contest. Hamilton complains that he was pushed off, over the radio. The stewards might want to take a look at the space Hamilton was given there. Lap 22/53: Leclerc resists Hamilton\u2019s attack down the straight, benefiting from the slipstream created by Hulkenburg in front of him. Bottas is currently in front, from Ricciardo and Hulkenburg. None of the top three have pitted. Leclerc is fourth and Hamilton fifth. Lap 21/53: Leclerc comes in to the pits, for hard compound tyres, and gets out just in front of Hamilton, whose tyres are better warmed up. The defending champion might be pleased with how this has gone. He\u2019s in DRS range when they\u2019re next through the activation zone. Can Leclerc\u2019s tyres last the pace? Lap 20/53: Hamilton comes back out in front of Sainz in fifth, on his new soft compound tyres. He has a 25 second gap now to the leader, but he\u2019ll fancy it. Lap 19/53: Pit window is now open. Suggestions that the Ferrari team are getting ready for tyre changes. Hamilton pits. Lap 18/53: Albon has a penalty for his move on Magnussen that gained him an advantage he shouldn\u2019t really have had. He has to stay stationary for five seconds at his pit stop. Verstappen continues to move up, to 13th now. Lap 17/53: The Mercedes team were coming out with a set of hard and compound tyres just there, but then appeared to change their minds and go back in. The teases. Leclerc leads by 1.55sec. Hamilton is on his game, but Leclerc\u2019s speed looks swift and true on the straights. Lap 16/53: Right, let\u2019s recap. Leclerc leads by 1.6sec now from Hamilton in second, Bottas 1.7 further back in third. Lap 15/53: Stroll gets a drive-through penalty for rejoining the track in an unsafe manner, a less severe punishment than Vettels but still a blow. Albon\u2019s driving well now, moving up into seventh. Verstappen moves slowly through the field from the back, moving into 15th. Lap 14/53: Vettel, then, is paying the price for not waiting for a martial to signal him back onto the track before he clashed with Stroll. Result being, he\u2019s at the very back of the field now. Leclerc leads by 1.5sec. Lap 13/53: Raikkonen is also being investigated for incorrect tyres, as Leclerc slightly stretches his lead to 1.38sec. Bottas is a further 1.35sec behind. Lap 12/53: Vettel gets a 10-second stop-go penalty for the way he came back onto the track in the incident with Stroll. He\u2019s having an absolute \u2019mare here. Lap 11/53: So Leclerc leads by 1.29sec, Hamilton is second with Bottas, Ricciardo, Hulkenburg and Sainz behind them. Lap 10/53: Albon could have to give back his overtake of Perez, with the stewards looking at whether he overtook while on the gravel. Vettel meanwhile is back in 19th at the moment, leaving Leclerc alone at the front with no teammate help as Hamilton and Bottas give pursuit. Lap 9/53: Hamilton says he\u2019s feeling good in his car but is being cautious with his rear tyres \u2013 and he\u2019s lost GPS tracking in his car. He knows he\u2019s second though, 1/3sec behind Ferrari\u2019s Leclerc. Lap 8/53: Out front, Hamilton has closed on Leclerc, making 2/10 of a second on the last lap. Leclerc leads by 1.2sec, with Bottas third, Ricciardo fourth and Hulkenburg fifth. Lap 7/53: Stroll complains on his radio that Vettel \u201ccame back on the circuit like an idiot\u201d in the clash between their cars. Vettel looks like he\u2019s going to take a penalty for that. Grosjean has also pitted. Lap 6/53: Vettel spins and is in trouble! The front of his car looks in a right old state after some kind of clash with Stroll. He\u2019s off the track for repairs. Futher back, Gasly is forced wide off the track too. Stoll\u2019s car has also taken a knock and he has to pit too. It\u2019s all happening. Lap 5/53: Grosjean goes past Kubica into 15th, while the Albon-Sainz incident is not deemed worthy of investigation by the stewards. Lap 4/53: Anyway, Leclerc leads by 1.4sec from Hamilton, with Bottas third and Vettel fourth. Hamilton\u2019s looking good here. Verstappen\u2019s back in the race but stuck at the back and Ricciardo passes his Renault teammate Hulkenburg. Lap 3/53: Carlos Sainz jostles with Albon, who careers off into the gravel, but stays in the race. The stewards might have a look at that. Lap 2/53: Verstappen needs a front-wing change already \u2013 is he going to last this race? Meanwhile, Vettel raises the crowd\u2019s spirits by restoring his lead over Hulkenburg. Leclerc still leads. Further back, Kubica moves up to 13th, Russel drops back to 15th. Lap 1/53: Leclerc is away well, Hamilton too, but Leclerc handles the first two turns well, Hamilton passes Bottas, while Hulkenburg goes past Vettel, dealing Ferrari a critical early blow. There\u2019s bother for Verstappen at the back though. They\u2019re off on the formation lap, Leclerc leading them down to the first chicane Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is making decent use of the international football break \u2013 he\u2019s hob-nobbing on the track for the pre-race interviews. Bottas speaks, briefly: \u201cWe can take it to [Ferrari] today, we have a good race car, and the starting position is close to them, between two red cars. For sure, the first turn is important to make some positions but it\u2019s a long race after that, and we have the pace for it.\u201d Anthem time: The Italian anthem \u2013 jaunty and catch as ever \u2013 rings out, accompanied by an impressive fly-by overhead. Martin Brundle\u2019s caught up with former F1 luminary Fernando Alonso in his pre-race track walk. The Spaniard is currently preparing for Paris-Dhaka, which he says is \u201ca bit scary, very different in lots of ways, but it\u2019s just motorsport so it has the same DNA as a competition. I\u2019m not missing [F1] too much, have been busy with endurance championship, indy racing, and now with this Dhaka challenge. I enjoy the formula one races on television but not missing - yet - being here.\u201d Weather news: blue skies and light clouds prevail in northern Italy, not a sign of the risk of rain that had been suggested. Though it did rain overnight. It\u2019s likely a one-stop race here at the temple of speed, reckoned to be between laps 19 and 29, and Sebastian Vettel will be under pressure to at least split the Mercedes drivers in front of him, and is in danger of being eclipsed at Ferrari by Leclerc. How he performs today after yesterday\u2019s chaos will be intriguing. Meanwhile, Leclerc feels the love from the Tifosi: Some pre-race interview chat: Max Verstappen, forced to start at the back, is targeting fifth place. \u201cEverything we did in the buildup was to maximise speed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not the fastest on the straight but not the slowest either, and the car is still handling really well. You have to look after your tyres, it\u2019s still a long race, but we have a good race car so we definitely can move forward \u2026 I\u2019m aiming for fifth.\u201d Inevitably, the Ferrari \u2018home passions\u2019 stuff is being ramped up \u2026 Pre-race reading: What with it being the 50th anniversary of Jackie Stewart\u2019s famous win at the Italian grand prix, our man in Monza, Giles Richards, had a chinwag with the great driver the other day. Read what he said here: And here\u2019s Giles\u2019s report on yesterday\u2019s qualifying: Afternoon everyone. So, with the destination of both the drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 titles seemingly a foregone conclusion, we may have to absorb ourselves in subplots and controversies and little individual battles as the season enters the home straight. And we\u2019re getting a few. Take yesterday\u2019s qualifying, when a game of \u201cno, after you, I insist\u201d among slipstream-keen drivers led to go-slows and accusations of blocking. Nonetheless, the upshot of it all was a Ferrari driver in pole for the 90th edition of the Italian grand prix. Monaco\u2019s Charles Leclerc will carry the Scuderia\u2019s hopes of a first success at Monza since 2010 as he looks to consolidate an impressive first campaign for the team and build on his win in Belgium last time out. The pace of the track and the backing of the crowd should stand him in good stead too. But right behind him on the grid is Lewis Hamilton, who has won the past two grands prix at this storied venue, with the world champion\u2019s teammate Valtteri Bottas a place further back. Hamilton can make a sixth world title even more nailed-down with victory today, and he\u2019s 5-4 favourite with the bookies for a reason. Max Verstappen starting at the back of the grid for having taken new engines and components \u2013 along with McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris and Toro Rosso\u2019s Pierre Gasly \u2013 will also be handy for the British driver. Of course motor sport is still reeling from the death of Anthoine Hubert, with Norris speaking in the week about the impact of the Frenchman\u2019s fatal accident last week. Safety will be in the spotlight this afternoon at the quickest track in F1. Hubert, Juan-Manuel Correa whose condition remains critical after the crash at Spa, will be prominent in the thoughts of many this afternoon. Here\u2019s how they line up on the grid: 1 Charles Leclerc, Ferrari; 2 Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes; 3 Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes; 4 Sebastian Vettel, Ferrari; 5 Daniel Ricciardo, Renault; 6 Nico Hulkenberg, Renault; 7 Carlos Sainz, McLaren Renault; 8 Alexander Albon, Red Bull; 9 Lance Stroll, Racing Point; 10 Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Alfa Romeo; 11 Antonio Giovinazzi, Alfa Romeo; 12 Kevin Magnussen, Haas; 13 Daniil Kvyat, Toro Rosso; 14 Lando Norris, McLaren Renault; 15 Pierre Gasly, Toro Rosso; 16 Romain Grosjean, Haas; 17 Sergio Perez, Racing Point; 18 George Russell, Williams; 19 Robert Kubica, Williams; 20 Max Verstappen, Red Bull Verstappen, Norris and Gasly required to start from back of grid due to multiple power unit element changes. Lights out 2.10pm BST.",

Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC\u2019s general secretary, called upon parliament not to budge until an extension to article 50 has been secured. It follows a standoff between parliament and the government over Johnson\u2019s plan to leave the EU on 31 October, come what may. Speaking at the first day of the TUC\u2019s annual congress, O\u2019Grady said MPs must force an extension before relinquishing control of the Brexit process. \u201cMy advice to MPs is this: when you\u2019ve got your opponent on the ropes \u2013 don\u2019t let them off. Hold your nerve until 31 October and call Boris Johnson\u2019s bluff. \u201cSo once we have that extension locked down, then let\u2019s have that general election on our terms \u2013 not his.

A no-deal Brexit would pave the way for a low-tax, low-regulation Britain that works for hedge fund managers but offers nothing for working people,\u201d O\u2019Grady added. The TUC will debate their own Brexit policy on Sunday afternoon, with some of the biggest unions still split over the direction of the Labour movement. While many unions would like the TUC to push for a second referendum in which they campaigned to remain, others, including the fire brigades\u2019 union, the communication workers\u2019 union and Unite\u2019s leader Len McCluskey have argued against this. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour\u2019s leader, is due to address the congress on Tuesday, followed by the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer\u2019s appearance on Wednesday.",

According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/03/hs2-to-be-delayed-by-up-to-five-years\" title=\"\">the conclusions of the current chairman</a> of HS2 Ltd, the first train services will be at least two years behind schedule and final completion could lag by seven years to 2040 \u2013 timescales which almost certainly imply further cost spirals ahead.</p> <p>The new transport secretary, Grant Shapps, did the right thing in releasing the report. Whatever the government may eventually decide after the short Oakervee review into HS2\u2019s costs and benefits, part of the ugly truth is in the open. Transparency is essential, both from HS2 and government.</p> <p>Both bear a portion of the blame for the current mess. Doubtless, HS2 Ltd has allowed swollen salaries and controversial payoffs that, at the very least, contravened public sector rules. Ministers cannot have been unaware of the pressure on budgets, and it was wishful thinking or wilful blindness to dole out concessions such as generous property compensation while claiming the budget ceiling could never be broken. It now transpires that geological surveys along much of the 330-mile route were yet to be conducted before HS2 decided how much it would cost to build the railway.</p> <p>But letting the sunlight in on HS2 Ltd should not blind us to the project\u2019s virtues. As with any public expenditure, the game of finding more deserving causes is easy. But HS2 has gained as much consensus as any infrastructure scheme, been legislated for, and is now under way to the tune of \u00a37bn. Even if a cheaper project might have been better in hindsight, any alternative would now spend another decade in the purgatory of planning and debate. For all its faults, eventually the high-speed line will enhance Britain. The nation will be best served by ploughing on, however reluctantly, with HS2.</p> <h2>Watchdog\u2019s weedy approach to Viagogo leaves fans exposed</h2> <p>Critics of the controversial ticket resale website Viagogo have been left scratching their heads after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/sep/05/watchdog-drops-viagogo-legal-case-after-changes-on-resale-site\" title=\"\">suspended its legal pursuit of the company</a> for contempt of court.</p> <p>The consumer watchdog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/04/cma-seeks-to-find-viagogo-in-contempt-of-court\" title=\"\">resorted to the courts</a> this year, after accusing Viagogo of repeatedly flouting laws designed to protect the public from sharp business practice.</p> <p>The CMA now says Viagogo has mended its ways but music industry groups and ticket industry sources insist that they\u2019ve seen examples as recently as last week that should test the regulator\u2019s confidence.</p> <p>It took the CMA far too long to act, but when the regulator finally stirred it gave Viagogo \u2013 a well-resourced multinational company \u2013 plenty of time to make changes that it should have made voluntarily. Now, after a \u00a32m investigation, the CMA appears to have given in.</p> <p>In its statement, the regulator said its tussle with Viagogo lent weight to its campaign to be given greater regulatory powers. It\u2019s hard not to think its weedy approach was always intended to highlight its impotence and bolster its case for better enforcement tools.</p> <p>Even if Viagogo were fully compliant with consumer law, there remains a debate to be had over the morality, rather than the legality, of the secondary ticketing market.</p> <p>The recent experience of Ed Sheeran fans, who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/30/ed-sheeran-criticised-by-fans-as-anti-touting-scheme-backfires\" title=\"\">left unable to sell tickets they couldn\u2019t use</a> due to unfair resale restrictions, shows some form of market must exist for fans to recoup some, or all, of their money if they can\u2019t go to a show. But permitting resale at vastly marked-up prices only ends up hitting devoted fans in the pocket, undermining efforts made by some artists to keep ticket costs down.</p> <p>It is the owners of secondary ticketing websites \u2013 and the parasitic touts who use them \u2013 who reap the rewards of this skewed marketplace. What role do such people have in the music industry, other than to exploit fans\u2019 passion for their profit?</p>",

Transparency is essential, both from HS2 and government. Both bear a portion of the blame for the current mess. Doubtless, HS2 Ltd has allowed swollen salaries and controversial payoffs that, at the very least, contravened public sector rules. Ministers cannot have been unaware of the pressure on budgets, and it was wishful thinking or wilful blindness to dole out concessions such as generous property compensation while claiming the budget ceiling could never be broken. It now transpires that geological surveys along much of the 330-mile route were yet to be conducted before HS2 decided how much it would cost to build the railway. But letting the sunlight in on HS2 Ltd should not blind us to the project\u2019s virtues. As with any public expenditure, the game of finding more deserving causes is easy. But HS2 has gained as much consensus as any infrastructure scheme, been legislated for, and is now under way to the tune of \u00a37bn. Even if a cheaper project might have been better in hindsight, any alternative would now spend another decade in the purgatory of planning and debate. For all its faults, eventually the high-speed line will enhance Britain. The nation will be best served by ploughing on, however reluctantly, with HS2. Watchdog\u2019s weedy approach to Viagogo leaves fans exposed Critics of the controversial ticket resale website Viagogo have been left scratching their heads after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) suspended its legal pursuit of the company for contempt of court. The consumer watchdog resorted to the courts this year, after accusing Viagogo of repeatedly flouting laws designed to protect the public from sharp business practice. The CMA now says Viagogo has mended its ways but music industry groups and ticket industry sources insist that they\u2019ve seen examples as recently as last week that should test the regulator\u2019s confidence. It took the CMA far too long to act, but when the regulator finally stirred it gave Viagogo \u2013 a well-resourced multinational company \u2013 plenty of time to make changes that it should have made voluntarily. Now, after a \u00a32m investigation, the CMA appears to have given in. In its statement, the regulator said its tussle with Viagogo lent weight to its campaign to be given greater regulatory powers. It\u2019s hard not to think its weedy approach was always intended to highlight its impotence and bolster its case for better enforcement tools. Even if Viagogo were fully compliant with consumer law, there remains a debate to be had over the morality, rather than the legality, of the secondary ticketing market. The recent experience of Ed Sheeran fans, who were left unable to sell tickets they couldn\u2019t use due to unfair resale restrictions, shows some form of market must exist for fans to recoup some, or all, of their money if they can\u2019t go to a show. But permitting resale at vastly marked-up prices only ends up hitting devoted fans in the pocket, undermining efforts made by some artists to keep ticket costs down. It is the owners of secondary ticketing websites \u2013 and the parasitic touts who use them \u2013 who reap the rewards of this skewed marketplace. What role do such people have in the music industry, other than to exploit fans\u2019 passion for their profit?",

But she has always loved photography, particularly the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson and the war photographer Don McCullin, who has himself documented Bradford\u2019s Muslim community. She has now been made an honorary member of the synagogue and continues to be a regular visitor. \u201cI think she has more to do with us,\u201d says Leavor, \u201cthan with her own mosque.\u201d \u2022 Kehillah is at the Boardrooms, Salts Mill, Saltaire, 13-22 September.",

      "body": "<p>One hot Wednesday morning in July, Bekky, a teacher from Horley in Surrey, put her two-year-old daughter into the back of her car and began the usual drive to work. \u201cThen out of nowhere,\u201d Bekky says, \u201cthis cat just banged into the side of my car.\u201d She only knew the impact was a cat when she stopped and saw the animal in her wing mirror, staggering around on the asphalt.</p> <p>Worries tumbled through her mind. First, for the cat, which she thought had gone under the rear wheels. Then for its owner, and the slim chance of finding them in a hurry. She also worried that she could be held responsible for the cat\u2019s injuries. A group of people watched from a bus stop down the road, until a bus arrived and took them away.</p> <p>Bekky found the cat under a bush, hurt but alive. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave it in that heat, but I had my daughter in the car, and no way of getting it.\u201d In the end, Bekky was able to find the cat\u2019s owner, a young woman who lived in a house nearby, who took it to a vet. Bekky spent an anxious day at work until news came that the cat would be OK. \u201cI was a bit of a wreck,\u201d she says. But that wasn\u2019t the only news. \u201cSomeone from work sent me a WhatsApp message saying: \u2018Is this you?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Looking at the link, she saw a public post from the local Facebook page. It was addressed to \u201cThe lady driver of a black/dark grey Fiesta who struck a black cat\u201d. \u201cIt was a gentleman who\u2019d been at the bus stop,\u201d Bekky says. \u201cHe was trying to reassure me that there was no way I could have stopped the car, because he\u2019d seen the cat dart straight out.\u201d Bekky joined the group, relieved, and replied that all was well, in order to prevent other cat-owners from worrying. Moments later, a stranger replied: \u201cWow Bekky, I wish you\u2019d run over my cat!\u201d After that, the praise and tributes continued for nearly a week. \u201cI was like a celebrity,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt amazing.\u201d </p> <p>But Bekky soon saw another side of her local group after the cat adventure faded from memory. Many posts were complaints, often about crime, and regularly naming one troublemaker in particular. \u201cThere was even a post where someone had taken pictures of a car in a driveway where they\u2019d seen people having sex. It really is a Jeremy Kyle sort of page. It made me think that everybody\u2019s watching.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Lisher runs <a href=\"https://nextdoor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the site Nextdoor</a> in the UK, which took over streetlife.co.uk in 2017. Nextdoor is an US social media firm with operations in 10 other countries. It provides a platform very similar to Facebook, but instead of connecting friends, it connects neighbours, who may not know each other at all and share only a neighbourhood. In Lisher\u2019s experience, ordinary motives bring people to Nextdoor first. \u201cWe don\u2019t have better machines to help you find a plumber than Google does,\u201d he says, \u201cbut sometimes a neighbour is better than an algorithm.\u201d Although the company doesn\u2019t release user numbers, the Nextdoor neighbourhoods so far created apparently cover 90% of the UK. In a few places more than 60% of the households are said to be subscribers, but from our straw poll of readers it seems that muddling through on Facebook or WhatsApp is much more widespread.</p> <p>Stories such as Bekky\u2019s were almost impossible a decade ago, when social media had not yet linked strangers into local groups. Now, they happen every day, bad stories as well as good. This week in Perth, Australia, a vegan woman, Cilla Carden, was unsuccessful in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/03/vegan-takes-neighbours-to-court-in-western-australia-over-smell-from-barbecues\" title=\"\">taking legal action</a> against her neighbours, who she claimed were deliberately barbecuing meat and fish in order to upset her with the smell. In response, someone created a Facebook event and 4,600 people said they were planning a ceremonial barbecue outside Carden\u2019s house before the page was taken offline. Only social media makes it possible to bully on such a scale.</p> <p>When we asked readers to tell us how local social media had changed their neighbourhoods, we were flooded with responses. \u201cI now know every single neighbour on my close on a first-name basis,\u201d says Baljinder, 34, from Birmingham, who started an online neighbourhood watch group for her street of 27 families. She says that it is all very good-natured \u201capart from crap jokes in the WhatsApp group\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe community will share food, residents offer furniture, we even had a mini-Olympics where we blocked off the street,\u201d says Nicky, 41, about the Facebook group for her cul-de-sac. \u201cAll neighbours should do this for their streets.\u201d</p> <p>People often get into local social media for practical reasons, but that is rarely where it ends. Raghaventra lives in an apartment block in Chennai, India, where he and others coordinate on WhatsApp to save water. \u201cThe WhatsApp group played a vital role in getting to know about my neighbours,\u201d he says. At Kate\u2019s block in Montreal, Canada, \u201cpeople exchange clothing and toys outgrown by their kids, ask for recommendations for handymen or babysitters\u201d, she says. \u201cWe know each other better and conversations flow easily when we meet during our daily life.\u201d</p> <p>As a young person living in rural Northumberland, Harvey finds his local Facebook groups a lifeline when it comes to finding things to do. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the main factors as to why I want to stay in the village and raise a family here,\u201d he says. Chris in London says: \u201cTo be able to live freely and normally and also communicate with my fellow gay neighbours, it is beyond my wildest dreams. I couldn\u2019t have managed to do that without technology and social media and it makes me happy, finally!\u201d</p> <p>People don\u2019t often talk about social media this way. Most public discussion seems to centre on whether it invades our privacy (it probably does) or harms our minds (it probably doesn\u2019t), leaving little room for positivity, which is strange considering how much people seem to love using it. When the May government launched its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-launches-governments-first-loneliness-strategy\" title=\"\">loneliness strategy</a> last October, the big idea was for GPs in England to start issuing \u201csocial prescriptions\u201d for art clubs and walking groups, in the hope that they would help people build connections with their neighbours. Another plan was for the then ministers Tracey Crouch and Margot James to meet the big tech companies and \u201cexplore the impact technology has on loneliness and how they can help prevent it\u201d. That\u2019s \u201cprevent\u201d, you\u2019ll notice, as if the impact must be bad.</p> <p>Local social media is often not anonymous, which prevents some of the abuses found on Twitter. At the same time, it feels like a more serious step to exclude someone from their neighbourhood group than ordinary social media. Nextdoor relies on a system of \u201clead\u201d users to report problematic posts, which it then decides either to retain or remove. Lisher describes three basic rules to cover people\u2019s conduct: \u201cBe helpful, not hurtful\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t use Nextdoor as a soapbox\u201d and \u201cPromote business the right way\u201d. It sounds simple, but Nextdoor\u2019s moderation team is the biggest in the company.</p> <p>When Sian and her partner moved into their east London flat in March, they joined the Facebook group that had been set up to cover their block and three others nearby. They soon regretted it. Sian says a few people dominated the group with complaints about loitering teenagers, misuse of the lift and other minor matters. But the main problem was the bins, which the council stopped collecting, claiming that residents were leaving rubbish on the floor. The bin room grew fuller and smellier and the problem became a hot topic on the group, where many voices blamed other neighbours for being messy. One day, a post announced that a letter with a resident\u2019s name and address on it had been found among some rubbish on the floor. They included a picture, adding, as Sian remembers it: \u201cThis is the person who is leaving their rubbish everywhere. They should be ashamed.\u201d</p> <p>Sian was shocked, and said they should have approached the man privately before posting his name and address to the group, where he couldn\u2019t defend himself because he hadn\u2019t joined. \u201cDo you want people knocking on his door?\u201d she said. Sian remembers about four or five regular posters replying to say: \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you do something about it then, because you never do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the saddest thing about Sian\u2019s case is that she and her neighbours were trying to be a community, but instead of bringing them together, Facebook pushed them apart. Six months after moving in, Sian feels that the group has permanently damaged her relationship with her fellow residents. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I know my neighbours,\u201d she says. \u201cAll I know is what their pet peeves are. I\u2019m sure if we bumped into each other in the hallway and we didn\u2019t have this group, we could have a friendly conversation. But now, because of the group, I just want to avoid that.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is her experience unusual. Deen from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, says that his neighbours, with the help of a new app, \u201care naming and shaming anything they don\u2019t like about others\u201d. Sometimes they add photographs and videos, he says.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t seem to realise that social media defamation remains defamation,\u201d says Kate, about her group in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p> <p>Disagreements are not likely to vanish from anybody\u2019s neighbourhood. Nor is social media, but neighbours could certainly learn to use it better. Lisher suspects that people are often surprised by the different atmosphere that exists in local groups, compared with the bespoke list of friends and celebrities that they follow on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s not an echo chamber,\u201d he says. \u201cSuddenly you find that your neighbours voted differently than you in the EU referendum \u2026 It\u2019s different in terms of the rules of engagement.\u201d</p> <p>In truth, social media may or may not make us more neighbourly. But it does show us more clearly who we always were.</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

It is widely expected that the bank will cut rates as part of a wider package to stimulate the economy, along with a pledge to keep them low for longer. It is a long-rumoured move to counter a weak manufacturing sector, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the ongoing global trade war. However, a rate cut would create a chasm within society, according to Christian Sewing, the head of Deutsche Bank, who said it would benefit those with assets while further burdening savers. He was backed up by Martin Zielke, chief executive of Commerzbank, who said it was neither sustainable nor responsible. While it has yet to be confirmed what will be coming this week, the cut in rates has long been expected and is likely to be part of a package of measures announced by the ECB in Frankfurt to support the eurozone. Rates have been held near zero in recent years in an attempt to stimulate growth, but the bank had intended to start raising them gradually. However, the ECB now expects that they will stay at the current levels or lower until next year. Behind this more cautious view is a weakening outlook for parts of the eurozone economy, with Mario Draghi, the ECB president, saying in July that the outlook was becoming progressively worse for sectors such as manufacturing. Last Friday, it emerged that German industrial output unexpectedly fell in July, adding to signs that struggling manufacturers could tip Europe\u2019s biggest economy into a recession in the third quarter, and supporting the case for the ECB to take action. Germany\u2019s industrial output fell by 0.6% on the month, bucking expectations for a rise of 0.3%. The drop was driven by a decline in the production of capital goods. Economists generally define a technical recession as at least two consecutive quarters of contraction, and the German economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter.

It\u2019s an intriguing opener for both sides, given that Spurs are new to the league and have brought in nine new players, seven of whom have WSL experience. The most noteworthy is Gemma Davison, who has bags of experience and can play in midfield or at full-back. Her influence will be key as head coaches Karen Hills and Juan Amoros try to mould a cohesive side with so many new recruits. Davison won the Double twice with Chelsea, too, so if you\u2019re looking for narrative in today\u2019s game, she provides plenty of it. You can read more about her here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/07/spurs-gemma-davison-chelsea-women-super-league-derby-football\">Spurs\u2019 Gemma Davison thrilled by big crowd prospect in Chelsea derby date</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Spurs might not be likely to challenge for the WSL title this season, there\u2019s a feeling that Chelsea might. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/28/chelsea-lyon-womens-champions-league-match-report\">They were narrowly beaten in the semi-finals</a> of the Champions League by untouchable Lyon last season but patchy domestic form led to them failing to qualify this time round. While that is a blow, it means they can put all their focus on the league. Chelsea\u2019s experienced manager, Emma Hayes, has shunned upheaval and kept a talented squad mostly intact, as well as adding the lethal Norwegian forward Guro Reiten to the squad. She scored 51 goals in 53 appearances for Toppserien champions LSK Kvinner. If she can transfer that form to the WSL, Chelsea could be a real force. </p> <p>Today\u2019s game is being played at Stamford Bridge, where 40,000 tickets have been given away to fans. Yesterday\u2019s Manchester derby <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/07/manchester-city-manchester-united-wsl-match-report\">attracted 31,000 to the Etihad Stadium</a>, a new record for the WSL.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with this. Bye. There are three other WSL matches under way now. Birmingham v Everton, Liverpool v Reading and champions Arsenal are already a goal up against West Ham. You can follow the scores here. As for Spurs, they can take heart from the fact that they have managed to live with one of the WSL\u2019s best sides away from home in front of a bumper crowd. They will be tough for the better sides to break down and, if they can build their team around Davison, they should be able to create enough chances against weaker opponents to give themselves a decent chance of a creditable first season in WSL. I was particularly impressed with Rebecca Spencer in goal, too, who they brought in from West Ham in the summer. On the evidence of today\u2019s match I\u2019d say Chelsea will be in the mix for the WSL title. Technically, they looked very good, and they will improve immeasurably as the season goes on. They played within themselves today against a team who were working as hard as they possibly could, and still could have run out 3-0 winners on another day. Guro Reiten was sharp on her debut and looks to have been an astute buy, while the rest of the squad will soon find their feet after a gruelling World Cup summer. Beth England, whose sublime strike settled the match, speaks: In front of this crowd and on this pitch I\u2019m so proud of the team. We used a high press and I got the ball and I thought \u2018just hit it\u2019. I trust my left foot and I thought \u2018get in there!\u2019 You look at our results last year and we made a slow start. But we got three points today. Tottenham did not make it easy for us. Credit to them, they\u2019ve come up a league and done well. Peep! It\u2019s three points for Chelsea, who were the far better side but looked a little rusty against the WSL newcomers. As for Spurs, they will be happy to have come away with only a narrow defeat. And with so many new players in the side they will get better as the season goes on. 90+4 min: Ji scuffs a shot at goal 10 yards from goal, which Spencer saves. A moment later, England wallops an effort straight at Spencer and ji is on her heels as the ball bounces out to her, allowing a Spurs defender to nip in ahead of her and clear. Ji has another chance a moment later, but chooses to square towards England instead and overhits her pass. Chelsea really should have scored a second there. 90+2 min: Spurs patiently play the ball forwards to Ayane. She finds Davison outsider her. The former Chelsea player swivels on the spot and shows lovely twinkly toes to escape her marker and dink a clever pass inside to Ayane, whose touch is clumsy as she races into the box. Davison will be key if Spurs are to have a good debut season in WSL. 90 min: England shrugs Neville off the ball and races to the touchline, but her second touch has too much on it and Spurs have a goal-kick. There\u2019ll be five minutes for Spurs to find an equaliser or for Chelsea to put this game to bed. 88 min: Ji fizzes a pass into the path of Cuthbert on the right. The Scottish winger drops her shoulder and sits down one Spurs defender before clattering a shot at goal that is blocked by another. Lovely jinking footwork, though. 87 min: The official attendance has just been confirmed at 24,564, the second biggest for a WSL match. Will they see a second goal? Let\u2019s hope so. 84 min: Tottenham\u2019s Worm is replaced by Ayane, who is a former Chelsea player. She couldn\u2019t, could she? And it was Andersson who came on for Blundell a little earlier. 83 min: Chelsea are pushing on here, which might just give Spurs a chance to nab an equaliser on the break. Furness overhits a cross to the back post when Spurs had decent numbers forwards. 81 min: Andersson is on for Chelsea. I didn\u2019t see who she replaced I\u2019m afraid. I did see Davison turn on a sixpence and drive into the Chelsea half, though. She then cut inside her marker and played a perfect pass into the path of Graham, who crossed low into the box, where a Chelsea defender cleared. Lovely stuff from Davison. 80 min: Reiten\u2019s delivery is deep and needs a strong hand from Spencer to turn it over the bar for a corner. The corner comes to nothing. 78 min: Beth England turns away from Peplow with a lovely body-swerve and then races for the touchline with four Spurs players in hot pursuit. She uses a little bit of trickery at the last to wrong-foot Peplow before winning a free-kick near the touchline. 76 min: Graham has clashed heads with Ingle and looks a bit groggy as she receives treatment. It\u2019s a nasty-looking clash that the Spurs player has come out of second best. She\u2019ll be checked on the touchline before coming back on. 73 min: The Chelsea fans give Erin Cuthbert a rowdy reception as the brilliant Scottish attacker replaces Engman. What a World Cup she had \u2013 including that soul-destroying, madcap exit! 72 min: Spurs make a change \u2013 Quinn\u2019s shift is over. Addison comes on for her. 70 min: Spurs are making life more difficult for Chelsea. They\u2019re being brave in possession this half and trying to play out from the back and find space down the channels. It\u2019s a pity they haven\u2019t got Davison on the ball more as she looks a class above, but Chelsea have kept a close eye on her. 68 min: Another free-kick for Chelsea wide on the left. But Reiten\u2019s delivery is poor and Spurs clear at the near post. Here\u2019s the video of Spence\u2019s vicious shot at goal that Spencer did well to tip on to the bar. 66 min: Neville has introduced her studs to Reiten\u2019s left shin. Ouch! The sparky Norwegian is OK but it\u2019s a nasty little tackle and the referee awards a free-kick and gives Neville a stern ticking off. Reiten\u2019s deep free-kick is cleared by Neville on the far post and Engman\u2019s shot at goal from 25 yards is wild and well wide. 64 min: Chelsea have looked at their most dangerous when Ji has been involved. She\u2019s the player most likely to unlock the Tottenham defence. When Chelsea have gone wide they\u2019ve looked predictable. But Ji looks more than capable of popping a killer pass through the Spurs backline in central areas. 62 min: And that\u2019s it for Spence. She\u2019s replaced by Cooper. 60 min: Ji finds Spence in midfield. She looks up and sees green grass and decides to run into it. Spurs defenders back off and Spence\u2019s eyes light up. Thwack! She unleashes a fierce shot that Spencer gets a strong hand to and diverts on to the bar. Reiten is alert and jumps to head at goal but the ball clatters the far post before Neville blocks Reiten\u2019s attempted follow-up shot. Spurs escape! What drama! 58 min: The ball\u2019s clipped down the line for Neville to scurry on to. The rampaging right-back does well to get to the ball first but then her touch lets her down and Chelsea get a goal-kick. Promising by Spurs again, though. 56 min: Spurs are beginning to grow in confidence. They\u2019re hanging on to the ball and playing crisper, more incisive passes forwards. Godfrey has a pop from distance but it\u2019s a wild effort and flies well over. 54 min: Blundell, who was looking to sprint down the left wing, is blocked crudely by Neville. Reiten curls the ball into the box, but Spurs clear and Davison picks up possession. The former Chelsea player is booed as she does so. She won the Double with Chelsea! Jeez. What happened to respect? 52 min: Spence gobbles up a shooting opportunity after Ji is stopped in her attempt to slip between two Spurs defenders. Her right-footed shot is powerful but straight down the throat of Spencer. 50 min: Furness is set free on the left by Graham. She steams into the Chelsea area and wallops a low first-time shot across Berger, which the Chelsea keeper does well to get down to and turn away for Eriksson to clear. Chelsea look half asleep. Complacency? 49 min: A chorus of \u201cSpurs go Marching in\u201d can be heard now. The travelling fans like what they\u2019ve seen in the opening minutes of this half. There\u2019s still no official record of the attendance but my estimation would be around 25,000, which means the Manchester derby attendance of 31,000 yesterday would still be the WSL record. 47 min: Spurs go on the attack straight away. Quinn hooks a deep cross to the back post. Davison collects. She does a smart stepover and smashes a low shot at goal that is deflected out for a corner, which comes to nothing. A brighter start though. 45 min: Spurs get the second 45 minutes under way. Can they get back into the game? It will take some effort to do so. Spurs have brought England U-21 international Peplow on for Haines. It doesn\u2019t look like Chelsea have made any changes. England manager Phil Neville is watching at Stamford Bridge. Beth England was left out of Neville\u2019s World Cup squad \u2013 and with a name like that too! She probably enjoyed scoring that goal in front of him. Half-time reading: Peep! And that\u2019s that. Spurs will be happy to get in to the dressing room only one goal down. Chelsea are playing within themselves. If they lift it in the second half Spurs may struggle to contain them. 45+1 min: Spurs are working their socks off to stop Chelsea getting a second before half-time. And that hard work by Tottenham forces Spence to play a speculative pass over the top of the defence that Spencer gathers. 44 min: Chelsea fly back up the other end and Reiten stings Spencer\u2019s palms with a left-footed shot drilled with power from 20 yards out. This game\u2019s warming up. It\u2019s a pity it\u2019s almost half-time. 41 min: Spurs keep possession diligently and work the ball to the right, where Graham cuts inside before feeding Haines on the edge of the box. There isn\u2019t much on for her on either side, so she drops a shoulder and shifts the ball on to her left foot before curling a fine effort inches wide of Berger\u2019s top right corner. 40 min: Godfrey\u2019s back up and running, which is just as well because Chelsea are pushing huge numbers of players forwards and have just won a corner. Reiten plays an outswinger towards Mjelde on the edge of the box. She tries to shimmy past her marker but is caught in possession and Spurs break \u2026 38 min: Godfrey comes off second best in a shoulder-to-shoulder challenge with Engman, who is supremely strong. It looks like she\u2019s landed on her shoulder, Mo Salah-style. Hopefully the physio will help to bend it back into full use. 35 min: Davison shows her class on the right, bamboozling her marker with quick feet before passing inside her and racing into the box. Graham picks up possession on the left and floats a lovely ball to the back post, where Neville controls with a lovely first touch but then loses possession with a clumsy second one. 33 min: Spurs almost steal an equaliser on the break. Haines turns sharply in central midfield and feeds Graham on the right, who is completely unmarked. She looks bemused to have so much space ahead of her but uses it well, driving into the box before fizzing a cross-shot towards Furness, that Berger gets a hand to before Eriksson clears under pressure. What a turnaround that would have been. 30 min: And Chelsea almost get that second goal! Spence plays a lovely no-look pass on the edge of the box for Reiten to race on to. She wastes no time in pulling a cross back towards Blundell, who steams in at the back post and scoops a shot at goal that Spencer does well to hold on to. She was under pressure as she hit it, which explains why it wasn\u2019t a clean connection. 28 min: For all Chelsea\u2019s dominance, they\u2019ll be disappointed if they don\u2019t go in at half-time with more than a 1-0 lead. 26 min: Ji, who is brimming with bright ideas, floats a lovely little ball in to Spence on the right side of the box. Spence volleys across the six-yard box first-time and England is this close to getting her head to it before Neville can clear. Wonderful play. 24 min: Mjelde stretches her legs on the right and drives forwards, before feeding Engman outside her. She shows the ball to Worm, who stabs at it and concedes a corner. Reiten whip it into the near-post. It\u2019s cleared and headed back in, where Bright leaps and nods over with a speculative back-header. 22 min: Like many openers, this has the feeling of a pre-season game as players get used to the pace of their first competitive match of the season. Chelsea are in total control. They\u2019re using the full width of Stamford Bridge and dragging Spurs all over the place. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re toying with their newly-promoted London rivals. 20 min: Reiten goes in late on Neville, who is shaking her hand in fury and pain as a result. It appears the Norwegian stood on it in the follow-through. Oof! Here\u2019s the goal, in case you haven\u2019t seen it. 16 min: Chelsea cut through Spurs again with some lovely, crisp passing. Percival is penalised for a foul near the edge of the box. Chelsea\u2019s players contest the decision. They believed play should have continued. From the resulting free-kick Eriksson has stab at the ball on the back post but it bounces up into the air and the Spurs goalkeeper Spencer collects. 13 min: Spurs are giving the ball away far too cheaply when they have it. It\u2019s a result of them playing too deep. When midfielders get on the ball they have very little ahead of them to aim at. Furness is the latest to be crowded off the ball in midfield but Reiten can\u2019t find Ji with her through-ball. Spurs were in trouble had she done so. 11 min: The free-kick is taken short but it\u2019s almost too clever for any Chelsea team-mate to read and Spurs clear. 10 min: The Chelsea fans are loving this, making a fair din as Reiten whips in a corner from the left towards Bright. Spurs clear but Chelsea are straight back on the ball and forming another attack. Schillaci slides into Spence with a horrible-looking tackle to bring the attack to a grisly end on the edge of the box. The Spurs captain is rightly booked. Thankfully, Spence isn\u2019t badly hurt and runs off the injury to her ankle. 6 min: The Spurs players need to keep their heads here. Chelsea are keeping possession with ease, pop, pop, popping the ball around their opponents in little triangles. Tottenham need to keep their shape and ride the next 10 minutes through without conceding. That didn\u2019t take long. And what a strike! Percival is robbed of possession in central midfield by England. The Chelsea midfielder drives forwards before curling a left-footed shot into the far top corner beautifully. She was a full 25 yards out, too. What a start for the home side at the Bridge! 2 min: Tottenham\u2019s Furness smashes into a tackle on Ji that we\u2019ll call a reducer. From the resulting free-kick, Spurs clear to the edge of the box, where the ball is flicked back into the danger zone for Eriksson to stab just wide from 10 yards out. It was a tricky chance that Chelsea\u2019s captain had to take on the stretch. 1 min: We\u2019re under way at a semi-full Stamford Bridge, where there\u2019s a decent atmosphere. Chelsea, in blue of course, get the match started. They\u2019re kicking from right to left on my TV. Spurs, wearing their famous white, are kicking the other way. It\u2019s almost time for kick-off at Stamford Bridge, which is filling up nicely. Liquidator has started playing on the PA. And here come the teams \u2026 Here\u2019s Spurs head coach Karen Hills on today\u2019s match, her side\u2019s first in the WSL: It\u2019s going to be a really proud moment for both myself and [fellow head coach] Juan [Amoros] \u2013 and obviously for the club and the players. It\u2019s an absolutely amazing stage \u2013 to go into the WSL and play at Stamford Bridge in front of what will probably be a record crowd, I\u2019m extremely proud. We\u2019ve got a fantastic squad that we\u2019ve built with new additions over the last 12 weeks. Every single one of the players is ready and excited to go out there, to perform and to play the best they possibly can. Karen Carney\u2019s retirement has led to Sweden\u2019s Magda Eriksson being handed the Chelsea armband. She\u2019s a brilliant player and person. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Nick Ames\u2019s summer interview with Eriksson and Denmark\u2019s Pernille Harder, in which they talk about their kiss in Paris that went viral, what it was like coming out and joining Common Goal. The Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, believes the grand stage will suit her team more than Spurs: The slight advantage we have is a bit more experience and we\u2019re used to playing in front of bigger crowds. We\u2019ve got a lot of international players that are used to be playing at major tournaments and competing for major trophies. So this is not anything that they are experiencing for the first time. I\u2019m looking forward to a packed house and to welcome a lot of new fans who are coming to the game. Sing as loud as you can, I want to hear your voices and players will want to too.\u201d Some more pre-match reading for you as we wait for kick-off. Here\u2019s Arsenal\u2019s Dani\u00eblle van de Donk on why she thinks the reigning WSL champions will be a grooved machine this season: So the Norwegian forward Reiten is straight into the starting XI for Chelsea, while Davison, a summer signing from Reading, starts for Spurs. The Tottenham players got a warm welcome as they arrived at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea: Berger, Blundell, Bright, Ingle, England, Ji, Reiten, Eriksson (c), Engman, Mjelde, Spence. Subs: Telford, Thorisdottir, Asante, Andersson, Cooper, Cuthbert, Fleming. Spurs: Spencer, Neville, Schillaci (c), Godfrey, Worm, Percival, Furness, Haines, Davison, Quinn, Graham. Subs: Morgan, Peplow, Leon, Filbey, McLean, Ayane, Addison. Hello. Welcome to coverage of today\u2019s WSL derby match between Chelsea and Tottenham. It\u2019s an intriguing opener for both sides, given that Spurs are new to the league and have brought in nine new players, seven of whom have WSL experience. The most noteworthy is Gemma Davison, who has bags of experience and can play in midfield or at full-back. Her influence will be key as head coaches Karen Hills and Juan Amoros try to mould a cohesive side with so many new recruits. Davison won the Double twice with Chelsea, too, so if you\u2019re looking for narrative in today\u2019s game, she provides plenty of it. You can read more about her here: While Spurs might not be likely to challenge for the WSL title this season, there\u2019s a feeling that Chelsea might. They were narrowly beaten in the semi-finals of the Champions League by untouchable Lyon last season but patchy domestic form led to them failing to qualify this time round. While that is a blow, it means they can put all their focus on the league. Chelsea\u2019s experienced manager, Emma Hayes, has shunned upheaval and kept a talented squad mostly intact, as well as adding the lethal Norwegian forward Guro Reiten to the squad. She scored 51 goals in 53 appearances for Toppserien champions LSK Kvinner. If she can transfer that form to the WSL, Chelsea could be a real force. Today\u2019s game is being played at Stamford Bridge, where 40,000 tickets have been given away to fans. Yesterday\u2019s Manchester derby attracted 31,000 to the Etihad Stadium, a new record for the WSL. Can today\u2019s game beat it? We\u2019ll soon see but, in any case, here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack on why more WSL games should be played in bigger stadiums: And while we wait for kick-off, why not peruse our club-by-club guide to the season ahead:",

I thought: \u2018Happy days.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Her Tottenham counterpart, Karen Hills, added: \u201cWe said on the way down that 10 years ago, we were playing in front of five or six people. Now we\u2019ve come all this way and we\u2019re playing in front of 25,000 people. Next week it might not be that but the standard now has been set and every single game has to be approached in the same manner, whether it\u2019s in a big stadium or an away stadium.\u201d</p> <p>With more than 40,000 tickets given out for the match there will likely be disappointment at not having beaten the record set in Manchester, but it was still five times higher than Chelsea\u2019s best league attendance and a more vocal and atmospheric support than their league rivals. Though the fact that more paid to watch the match at the Etihad than attended this game for free has shown the importance of putting a value on top-level women\u2019s football, there is hope that we are at the start of an arms race between top teams to lift the record higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWas it better than yesterday?\u201d asked Hayes of the atmosphere. \u201cAh come on this is Chelsea, this isn\u2019t the emptihad is it?\u201d she jested after being told it was. \u201cMan City can be equally proud, I\u2019m being cheeky.\u201d</p> <p>England\u2019s early goal gave the home side a small cushion but the Blues struggled to capitalise on a dominant first-half performance, giving the WSL debutants Spurs hope and providing a scintillatingly tense finish to the London derby.</p> <p>Hayes was strangely pleased by the tightness of the result, saying: \u201cThis would have been a disaster if this was six or seven-nil, thank goodness. That sounds a bit odd to say that as a manager but I care about the game.\u201d</p> <p>The home side burst out of the blocks with intensity and in the fourth minute they had the breakthrough thanks to a cracking goal. England muscled the former West Ham player Ria Percival off the ball, cut inside and hammered her shot past Becky Spencer from 25 yards out. If Caroline Weir\u2019s effort for Manchester City from a similar distance the day before had laid down an early goal-of-the-season marker, England\u2019s strike upped the ante.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/08/phil-neville-actions-speak-louder-than-words\">Phil Neville must understand that actions speak louder than words | Barry Glendenning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the perfect start for a fresh-to-women\u2019s-football crowd, which sprung into life as England wheeled away and did a knee slide towards fans behind the home dugout before being engulfed by teammates.</p> <p>Chelsea should have scored more. The 2017-18 Double winners passed the ball around slickly, with the full-backs Hannah Blundell and Maren Mjelde effective on the wings.</p> <p>Despite the Chelsea dominance, Spurs were not without chances and Hayes would likely have been frustrated that her side failed to extend their lead. A Kit Graham cross was cut out by a diving Ann-Katrina Berger but the goalkeeper could only parry it. Rachel Furness almost collected the loose ball but a smart clearance from Bright spared Chelsea\u2019s blushes.</p> <p>It was rare time on the ball and the Spurs first-team coach, Juan Amoros, looked pained on the edge of his technical area but it did give the visitors hope. Chelsea rode out subsequent pressure and with their big-game experience and stronger legs proving just too much they set up camp in the Tottenham box, with Ji masterminding every chance.</p> <p>Now, Hayes\u2019s focus is on pushing on, on and off the pitch. \u201cWomen\u2019s football will continue to grow and I\u2019m so proud of this football club. I doubt I will ever work at a place that has pushed for women to progress like this place has.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about having sensible conversations. It\u2019s not just saying we want to play here week in week out, first of all our men\u2019s team play here. It\u2019s always been their home and for us it\u2019s about recognising the opportunities, first we\u2019ve got to build on getting people to Kingsmeadow, then when the opportunity comes to play here we will have a blueprint of how to market this game and our CEO will make sure every club in the country has it. It is about osmosis, it is about sharing information and driving standards and I\u2019m pretty certain that\u2019s why I was put on this earth.\u201d</p> <h2>Nobbs returns as Arsenal hold off Hammers</h2> <p><strong>Arsenal</strong>, the Women\u2019s Super League champions, held on to beat a resilient <strong>West Ham</strong> side 2-1 on Sunday, thanks to first\u2011half goals from Beth Mead and Jill Roord.</p> <p>Last season the Hammers similarly gave Arsenal a scare, twice taking the lead before the Gunners ran out 4-3 winners in their second game of the season. This time, the visitors clawed a goal back via the head of Martha Thomas. They pushed for the equaliser and Arsenal fans were left sweating when West Ham were awarded a free-kick for a backpass late on. Arsenal shirts crowded across the line, with Manuela Zinsberger in front trying to make herself big. It worked. The goalkeeper got her fingertips under Kenza Dali\u2019s effort from 12 yards and pushed it on to the top of the bar.</p> <p>There was an emotional return to competitive action for Jordan Nobbs, who missed the World Cup with a knee ligament injury. The Arsenal and England midfielder came on in the 67th minute and almost instantly made an impact, hitting a first-time shot wide of the post shortly after coming on.</p> <p>A crushing own goal from the <strong>Birmingham </strong>captain, Kerys Harrop, moments after the break meant <strong>Everton</strong> took a first three points off their opposition in seven years. Willie Kirk\u2019s team won only three times in the league last term but Hannah Cain\u2019s diverted cross was enough for a victorious start.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a typically stunning Fara Williams free-kick from 25 yards gave <strong>Reading</strong> a 1-0 win at <strong>Liverpool</strong>. The England record cap holder blasted over seconds into the game but it was in the 40th minute that she made her mark, guiding the ball perfectly past Anke Preuss in the Liverpool goal. Grace Moloney, the Reading goalkeeper, kept the visitors in front when she read a heavy touch from Courtney Sweetman-Kirk, who found herself through one-on-one, just after the break.</p>",

Next week it might not be that but the standard now has been set and every single game has to be approached in the same manner, whether it\u2019s in a big stadium or an away stadium.\u201d With more than 40,000 tickets given out for the match there will likely be disappointment at not having beaten the record set in Manchester, but it was still five times higher than Chelsea\u2019s best league attendance and a more vocal and atmospheric support than their league rivals. Though the fact that more paid to watch the match at the Etihad than attended this game for free has shown the importance of putting a value on top-level women\u2019s football, there is hope that we are at the start of an arms race between top teams to lift the record higher. \u201cWas it better than yesterday?\u201d asked Hayes of the atmosphere. \u201cAh come on this is Chelsea, this isn\u2019t the emptihad is it?\u201d she jested after being told it was. \u201cMan City can be equally proud, I\u2019m being cheeky.\u201d England\u2019s early goal gave the home side a small cushion but the Blues struggled to capitalise on a dominant first-half performance, giving the WSL debutants Spurs hope and providing a scintillatingly tense finish to the London derby. Hayes was strangely pleased by the tightness of the result, saying: \u201cThis would have been a disaster if this was six or seven-nil, thank goodness. That sounds a bit odd to say that as a manager but I care about the game.\u201d The home side burst out of the blocks with intensity and in the fourth minute they had the breakthrough thanks to a cracking goal. England muscled the former West Ham player Ria Percival off the ball, cut inside and hammered her shot past Becky Spencer from 25 yards out. If Caroline Weir\u2019s effort for Manchester City from a similar distance the day before had laid down an early goal-of-the-season marker, England\u2019s strike upped the ante. It was the perfect start for a fresh-to-women\u2019s-football crowd, which sprung into life as England wheeled away and did a knee slide towards fans behind the home dugout before being engulfed by teammates. Chelsea should have scored more. The 2017-18 Double winners passed the ball around slickly, with the full-backs Hannah Blundell and Maren Mjelde effective on the wings. Despite the Chelsea dominance, Spurs were not without chances and Hayes would likely have been frustrated that her side failed to extend their lead. A Kit Graham cross was cut out by a diving Ann-Katrina Berger but the goalkeeper could only parry it. Rachel Furness almost collected the loose ball but a smart clearance from Bright spared Chelsea\u2019s blushes. It was rare time on the ball and the Spurs first-team coach, Juan Amoros, looked pained on the edge of his technical area but it did give the visitors hope. Chelsea rode out subsequent pressure and with their big-game experience and stronger legs proving just too much they set up camp in the Tottenham box, with Ji masterminding every chance. Now, Hayes\u2019s focus is on pushing on, on and off the pitch. \u201cWomen\u2019s football will continue to grow and I\u2019m so proud of this football club. I doubt I will ever work at a place that has pushed for women to progress like this place has. \u201cIt\u2019s about having sensible conversations. It\u2019s not just saying we want to play here week in week out, first of all our men\u2019s team play here. It\u2019s always been their home and for us it\u2019s about recognising the opportunities, first we\u2019ve got to build on getting people to Kingsmeadow, then when the opportunity comes to play here we will have a blueprint of how to market this game and our CEO will make sure every club in the country has it. It is about osmosis, it is about sharing information and driving standards and I\u2019m pretty certain that\u2019s why I was put on this earth.\u201d Nobbs returns as Arsenal hold off Hammers Arsenal, the Women\u2019s Super League champions, held on to beat a resilient West Ham side 2-1 on Sunday, thanks to first\u2011half goals from Beth Mead and Jill Roord. Last season the Hammers similarly gave Arsenal a scare, twice taking the lead before the Gunners ran out 4-3 winners in their second game of the season. This time, the visitors clawed a goal back via the head of Martha Thomas. They pushed for the equaliser and Arsenal fans were left sweating when West Ham were awarded a free-kick for a backpass late on. Arsenal shirts crowded across the line, with Manuela Zinsberger in front trying to make herself big. It worked. The goalkeeper got her fingertips under Kenza Dali\u2019s effort from 12 yards and pushed it on to the top of the bar. There was an emotional return to competitive action for Jordan Nobbs, who missed the World Cup with a knee ligament injury. The Arsenal and England midfielder came on in the 67th minute and almost instantly made an impact, hitting a first-time shot wide of the post shortly after coming on. A crushing own goal from the Birmingham captain, Kerys Harrop, moments after the break meant Everton took a first three points off their opposition in seven years. Willie Kirk\u2019s team won only three times in the league last term but Hannah Cain\u2019s diverted cross was enough for a victorious start. Meanwhile, a typically stunning Fara Williams free-kick from 25 yards gave Reading a 1-0 win at Liverpool. The England record cap holder blasted over seconds into the game but it was in the 40th minute that she made her mark, guiding the ball perfectly past Anke Preuss in the Liverpool goal. Grace Moloney, the Reading goalkeeper, kept the visitors in front when she read a heavy touch from Courtney Sweetman-Kirk, who found herself through one-on-one, just after the break.",

However, this eloquent and likable man\u2019s utterances tend to carry more weight when the blazer is off and he is telling them what they actually need to hear. Nowhere was this more apparent than when he was recently invited to address the sorry plight of Bury, an institution particularly close to his heart due in no small part to the service his mother and late father devoted to the club before its recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/27/bury-historic-club-football-league-financial-ruins\" title=\"\">expulsion from the Football League</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful.

There is no shame whatsoever in being knocked out of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/02/usa-england-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">World Cup semi-final by the USA</a> but in defeat England\u2019s manager demonstrated a tactical naivety that occasionally bordered on arrogance. Playing a winger as a No 10 in such a big game clearly backfired, while his continuing persistence with rotation can often seem like needless meddling. Considering their manager\u2019s pedigree as an elite defender, the almost comical inability of England\u2019s women to defend corners and crosses remains little short of baffling.</p> <p>A lot done, then, but plenty more to do. Should Neville turn out to be even half the courageous visionary he claims to be, Team GB are in very safe hands indeed as they build towards next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo. In the meantime we don\u2019t need to hear him tell us gold medals are shiny. Just win the tournament and show us the glint from the one hanging around your neck.</p>",

His similarities to David Brent were first pounced upon during the Women\u2019s World Cup by the men behind the Dublin-based Second Captains podcast, who recorded a musical bed juxtaposing soliloquies from both men and soundtracked by the theme music of The Office. In what would become a hit on social media, the absurd rhetoric of each man was only distinguishable by their contrasting voices and accents. Like Brent the chilled-out entertainer, Neville the football manager seems to say particular things at particular times because he believes they happen to be exactly what his audience wishes to hear. However, this eloquent and likable man\u2019s utterances tend to carry more weight when the blazer is off and he is telling them what they actually need to hear. Nowhere was this more apparent than when he was recently invited to address the sorry plight of Bury, an institution particularly close to his heart due in no small part to the service his mother and late father devoted to the club before its recent expulsion from the Football League. \u201cI\u2019m devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful. Bury, after 125 years, no longer has a football club. The heart of the town has been ripped apart. Now it\u2019s up to the Bury people \u2013 myself included \u2013 to try to put some heart back into a town that relied heavily on a football club. It\u2019s emotional for me. My mum\u2019s given her heart and soul to that club, my dad \u2013 it nearly killed him at one point.\u201d You don\u2019t hear that kind of informed, well-articulated seething rage in the corridors of Wernham Hogg. Since taking the Lionesses post, Neville has done a reasonably decent job all things considered, but has yet to live up to the high standards he set himself upon accepting it. There is no shame whatsoever in being knocked out of a World Cup semi-final by the USA but in defeat England\u2019s manager demonstrated a tactical naivety that occasionally bordered on arrogance. Playing a winger as a No 10 in such a big game clearly backfired, while his continuing persistence with rotation can often seem like needless meddling. Considering their manager\u2019s pedigree as an elite defender, the almost comical inability of England\u2019s women to defend corners and crosses remains little short of baffling. A lot done, then, but plenty more to do. Should Neville turn out to be even half the courageous visionary he claims to be, Team GB are in very safe hands indeed as they build towards next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo. In the meantime we don\u2019t need to hear him tell us gold medals are shiny. Just win the tournament and show us the glint from the one hanging around your neck.",

      "bodyText": "I am a big advocate of thank-you notes, as people will always think better of you for saying thank you properly. We can all send a WhatsApp message, but it is not the same as sitting down, putting pen to paper, getting a first-class stamp and sending it off in the post. That will mean a lot more to a person than something that gets lost in the digital noise. You should send your thank-you note as soon as possible after the event has taken place, or after you have received your gift. Christmas is the only occasion where you have a week or so to respond, since everyone is so busy. Princess Diana supposedly started her thank-you letters before the event \u2013 it meant she never forgot. Don\u2019t start with \u201cthank you\u201d, though: it is prosaic and predictable. Start with something personal about the experience or gift, then go on to the thank you. The more hospitality you have received, the longer the message should be. Try to make sure the stationery is fairly nice; some people use postcard-sized correspondence cards, so their notes are only a couple of lines long. If you are using paper, go for A5 and write a maximum of two separate pieces of paper. Never write on the back. I would send a gift in advance if I were going somewhere, or bring it with me and then follow it up afterwards with a note. If they have gone completely out of their way, you can send two gifts \u2013 no one is going to stop you.

The British must tell us what they want,\u201d Le Drian said.</p> <p>When asked if an extension beyond 31 October was possible, Le Drian said the EU\u2019s patience was waning. \u201cWe are not going to do this [extend the deadline] every three months,\u201d the French minister added. The Benn bill, due to receive royal assent this week, would extend the UK\u2019s membership until 31 January 2020.</p> <p>The UK government wants to remove the Irish backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>But sources in Brussels, where Boris Johnson\u2019s envoy, David Frost, has been in twice-weekly talks with the European commission\u2019s Brexit taskforce, said the process of finding a ready alternative was proving to be \u201ca farce\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been no substantive proposals on how to replace the backstop and the British are pretending otherwise \u2013 we are being instrumentalised for domestic purposes,\u201d said one diplomat.</p> <p>EU sources have said there is no evidence the British government is even working on \u201cconcrete proposals\u201d to strike a Brexit deal, and the latest resignations from the government, recent reports of \u201csham negotiations\u201d and constant election talk have all contributed to the impression that the government is not serious about finding an agreement.</p> <p>The comments appear to confirm the fears of the former work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/amber-rudd-resigns-from-cabinet-and-surrenders-conservative-whip\">resigned on Saturday</a>, citing the lack of effort being put into negotiating a deal.</p> <p>On Friday, Frost proposed to hold discussions over an all-Ireland agri-food zone, which Johnson has said may offer a \u201cgerm\u201d of a solution to the current Brexit impasse.</p> <p>The EU insists that such a concept on its own falls far short of honouring the commitments made by the British government to maintain the all-Ireland economy after Brexit and avoid checks on all goods passing between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the Brits ringing up saying: \u2018It\u2019s great that we are going to work on this agri-food zone idea,\u2019 but it just feels like a distraction from all the other problems that need solving,\u201d a source said.</p> <p>Of the last meeting with Frost, the diplomat added: \u201cNo proposals on the idea itself were received and therefore discussed.\u201d</p> <p>In Brussels, the absence of papers is seen as a sign that the UK is not serious about finding an agreement. British officials reject this criticism: the UK has not put pen to paper because ministers are worried the EU will immediately shoot down proposals.

      "bodyText": "The French government has threatened to veto a further Brexit extension due to the \u201cworrying\u201d lack of progress in the recent talks, as EU diplomats expressed their frustration at being caught up in game-playing by the British government. In a sign of rising exasperation, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, highlighted the lack of realistic proposals being put forward by Downing Street as an alternative to the Irish backstop. \u201cIt\u2019s very worrying. The British must tell us what they want,\u201d Le Drian said. When asked if an extension beyond 31 October was possible, Le Drian said the EU\u2019s patience was waning. \u201cWe are not going to do this [extend the deadline] every three months,\u201d the French minister added. The Benn bill, due to receive royal assent this week, would extend the UK\u2019s membership until 31 January 2020. The UK government wants to remove the Irish backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. But sources in Brussels, where Boris Johnson\u2019s envoy, David Frost, has been in twice-weekly talks with the European commission\u2019s Brexit taskforce, said the process of finding a ready alternative was proving to be \u201ca farce\u201d. \u201cThere have been no substantive proposals on how to replace the backstop and the British are pretending otherwise \u2013 we are being instrumentalised for domestic purposes,\u201d said one diplomat. EU sources have said there is no evidence the British government is even working on \u201cconcrete proposals\u201d to strike a Brexit deal, and the latest resignations from the government, recent reports of \u201csham negotiations\u201d and constant election talk have all contributed to the impression that the government is not serious about finding an agreement. The comments appear to confirm the fears of the former work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, who resigned on Saturday, citing the lack of effort being put into negotiating a deal. On Friday, Frost proposed to hold discussions over an all-Ireland agri-food zone, which Johnson has said may offer a \u201cgerm\u201d of a solution to the current Brexit impasse. The EU insists that such a concept on its own falls far short of honouring the commitments made by the British government to maintain the all-Ireland economy after Brexit and avoid checks on all goods passing between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \u201cWe have the Brits ringing up saying: \u2018It\u2019s great that we are going to work on this agri-food zone idea,\u2019 but it just feels like a distraction from all the other problems that need solving,\u201d a source said. Of the last meeting with Frost, the diplomat added: \u201cNo proposals on the idea itself were received and therefore discussed.\u201d In Brussels, the absence of papers is seen as a sign that the UK is not serious about finding an agreement. British officials reject this criticism: the UK has not put pen to paper because ministers are worried the EU will immediately shoot down proposals. The UK would like Brussels to share the task of finding an alternative to the backstop. An EU diplomat said that \u201cgiven the present stance of No 10 and the apparent lack of concrete and implementable UK proposals to substitute the backstop, frustration is growing rapidly among the EU27\u201d. That exasperation has been further fuelled by the decision to pull UK officials out of some EU meetings as part of what Johnson has described as an \u201cunshackling\u201d from the bloc. \u201cThey have taken people out of these meetings so they can work on no deal, but then they have to ring round the member states begging for reports of what is being discussed,\u201d complained one EU diplomat. \u201cIt just becomes more ridiculous by the day.\u201d The threats by the UK government as it battles with parliament over an extension beyond 31 October could further poison relations when the British government is seeking concessions in Brussels. Downing Street officials have suggested that if Johnson were forced to extend the UK\u2019s membership of the EU he would not nominate a European commissioner, which would leave the bloc\u2019s institutions in limbo and unable to work. Sources have suggested that this threat would be enough to dissuade the EU from agreeing to an extension. A former director general of the EU council\u2019s legal services, Jean-Claude Piris, said the UK gambit was based on a misunderstanding. He said: \u201cThe commission will be legally able to function and take legal decisions with a member less. If the UK is still an EU member it is that member state which would violate the treaty and could be brought to the EU court of justice. \u201cThe EU parliament will not find that the commission will not be legally constituted. The commission has already functioned during a period with a number of members inferior to the number set up by the treaty.\u201d The French foreign minister\u2019s threat of blocking an extension will be seen as an expression of heightened irritation but EU sources have suggested it is unlikely to come to pass. EU leaders have said a second referendum or general election would be sufficient reason to extend again and, for all the frustration at the British, there is a reluctance to appear to be pushing the UK out of the bloc. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has repeatedly said a no-deal Brexit would never be an EU choice.",

      "body": "<p>The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has failed to rule out a Conservative alliance with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party at a general election.</p> \n<p>He told the BBC that the Tories did not need an electoral alliance but did not categorically deny that they might need to work with Farage, whose party took close to half of the UK\u2019s seats at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019-european-parliamentary-elections\">European elections</a> in May.</p> \n<p>Javid said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need an electoral alliance with anyone. We can stand on our own two feet.\u201d However, pushed three times during his interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, he failed to rule out a specific deal being struck. Farage has said he is prepared not to stand candidates in Tory areas where he could end up splitting leave voters and told the Tories they will not win an election without his support.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives currently have no majority in the Commons and there are concerns they may struggle to win a snap election despite polling showing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/tories-extend-lead-over-labour-to-10-despite-chaotic-week\">large</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/tories-extend-lead-over-labour-to-10-despite-chaotic-week\"> lead</a> over Labour.</p> \n<p>Pressed by Marr, Javid replied: \u201cThe picture our opponents are painting of us \u2026 and of course they would paint a false picture \u2026 we are a proud centre-right, moderate, one nation party. There is nothing extremist about wanting to meet the will of the British people on a simple question, which was: do you want to leave the EU or not?\u201d</p> \n<p>Marr said: \u201cI\u2019m asking you one question, can you rule out an agreement with the Brexit party, yes or no?\u201d</p> \n<p>Javid said: \u201cWe\u2019re not in an election yet. When we get there I\u2019m clear we don\u2019t need an alliance with anyone. I think our message will resonate across the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Farage\u2019s offer to help the Tories by standing aside in key leave seats is dependent on his party being allowed a clear shot in Labour heartlands.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has failed to rule out a Conservative alliance with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party at a general election. He told the BBC that the Tories did not need an electoral alliance but did not categorically deny that they might need to work with Farage, whose party took close to half of the UK\u2019s seats at the European elections in May. Javid said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need an electoral alliance with anyone. We can stand on our own two feet.\u201d However, pushed three times during his interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, he failed to rule out a specific deal being struck. Farage has said he is prepared not to stand candidates in Tory areas where he could end up splitting leave voters and told the Tories they will not win an election without his support. The Conservatives currently have no majority in the Commons and there are concerns they may struggle to win a snap election despite polling showing a large lead over Labour. Pressed by Marr, Javid replied: \u201cThe picture our opponents are painting of us \u2026 and of course they would paint a false picture \u2026 we are a proud centre-right, moderate, one nation party. There is nothing extremist about wanting to meet the will of the British people on a simple question, which was: do you want to leave the EU or not?\u201d Marr said: \u201cI\u2019m asking you one question, can you rule out an agreement with the Brexit party, yes or no?\u201d Javid said: \u201cWe\u2019re not in an election yet. When we get there I\u2019m clear we don\u2019t need an alliance with anyone. I think our message will resonate across the country.\u201d Farage\u2019s offer to help the Tories by standing aside in key leave seats is dependent on his party being allowed a clear shot in Labour heartlands. He believes this deal could enable the government to return a majority of more than 100. Javid said an election was necessary because parliament was trying to \u201ckneecap\u201d the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations. He denied the party was offering nothing to the 48% of voters who voted remain in 2016. He said the public liked \u201call the other things\u201d they have been talking about such as \u201ckeeping the economy strong\u201d. With a general election looming, both parties have been scrambling to show they have something to offer both leavers and remainers. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, found herself mocked last week after setting out Labour\u2019s current stance, which is to negotiate a fresh Brexit deal with the EU27 before putting that to the public in a referendum. She and several other senior figures, including Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, have said they would then campaign for remain in that vote. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, appeared to signal a shift from that approach on Sunday, suggesting the leave option put to voters could essentially be the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May. \u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of just confirming what the offer would be and we\u2019ve said then it has to go back to the people again,\u201d McDonnell said.

      "bodyText": "Regional elections in Norway on Monday are being billed as a referendum on the country\u2019s environmental policies, with the country split over road toll rises that have already threatened to bring down the national government. A sharp increase in motorway toll and congestion charges in recent years has helped fuel a political movement that is proving a threat to mainstream parties in a number of major cities. A new anti-tolls party, People\u2019s Action \u2013 No to More Road Tolls (FNB), is forecast to make major gains at the expense of the populist Progress party, one of the governing parties in the national coalition, but also Labour and the right. Norway\u2019s politicians suffered a major shock in May when polls had the anti-toll party on 25.4% of the vote in the city of Bergen and 6% nationally, making it the fifth-largest party, although its numbers have since dropped. Trym Aafl\u00f8y, the FNB\u2019s leader in Bergen, told a TV debate this week: \u201cWe have created a political earthquake in Norway.\u201d The anger against the rise in toll charges, and the manner in which it has dominated political debate, can in part be attributed to Norwegians\u2019 love of cars. For every 1,000 citizens there are 514 cars, second only to Germany in car ownership among European nations. The issue is particularly toxic for Progress, which presents itself as the motorists\u2019 party, and from which the current minister of transport is drawn. The anti-toll protest is seen by some as a Nordic variant on the gilets jaunes movement in France, representing a backlash against the imposition of extra costs on drivers in the name of environmental protection. Such is the anger that Sindre Finnes, the husband of Norway\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, was briefly dragged into the issue due to his previous shareholdings in companies that make money at toll booths. The FNB is expected to do particularly well in Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger, where the anti-toll party was founded in 2014. In August, Solberg narrowly escaped presiding over a minority government when there was conflict between two of the four parties in her coalition, Progress and the centrist Liberals, over how to pay for roads and public transport. The rightwing Progress party has been calling for large cuts to road tolls, a policy opposed by the Liberals. The coalition\u2019s compromise involved an agreement that the state will increase its financial contribution in public-private partnerships \u2013 so-called 50/50 projects \u2013 to 66% to fund a cut in the costs to motorists on toll roads.

The Museum of Design in Den Bosch is showcasing sculpture by Adolf Hitler\u2019s favourite artist, Arno Breker, a 1943 VW Beetle, photos and Leni Riefenstahl films from the era, in what is being billed as the first great exposition of the \u201cDesign of the Third Reich\u201d. Running for five months, the exhibition has been criticised by the Association of Dutch Anti-fascists, which has called in vain for local authorities to intervene. As the museum opened, activists from the local communist party staged a small protest a few hundred metres from the institution\u2019s front door. The Museum of Design\u2019s director, Timo de Rijk, said he was sensitive to the need to avoid glorifying the exhibits and all efforts were being made to treat the issue with sensitivity. The only area where photography is allowed is by the Volkswagen Beetle, and extra security has been put on in each room. De Rijk said: \u201cI have had no signal that people from the far left or far right are planning to come to the museum, but you never know. \u201cFrom the start we explain that this was a racist ideology and that the party\u2019s aim was to establish a racist volk culture.

      "body": "<p>Chris \u201cSacriel\u201d Ball\u2019s computer is worth \u00a320,000 and looms over me like a monolith. It is a completely silent machine, an alien spacecraft, and pulses with orange-yellow tubes of coolant, which keep the graphics card and motherboard from melting out of it like an ice pop. This machine is used to kill people: three, so far, today, but there will be countless more over the next eight hours. Behind there\u2019s a looming greenscreen, as though Ball is an especially violent weather presenter; in front, a bank of four computer screens, each streaming an unending loop of information. </p> <p>Ball is a gaming streamer. He started seven years ago on YouTube, then pivoted to Twitch. And now it supports him and a team of over 20. His house is the most beautiful home I\u2019ve ever been to. His kitchen is a palace and his dogs are adorable. I wonder briefly if anyone would pay to watch me play Fortnite in just my pants, and what dark, awful things I would do with the ensuing wealth. Ball specialises in tactical combat games where he chillingly explodes the heads of hundreds of competing gamers, and 507 people are watching him do it right now. They are following his antics through <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\" title=\"\">Twitch</a>, a website where you can watch people doing things. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the entire concept. It feeds live from people\u2019s living rooms, bedrooms and dedicated gaming rooms, out to thousands of devices at once. If YouTube is a <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em>-style summer blockbuster, Twitch is the concurrent <em>Big Brother </em>equivalent: live cameras, often at a fixed and unflattering angles, revelling in conversational silence. Though it started out as primarily for gamers, the site has since evolved into a teeming community with people existing, doing, being on camera, and essentially performing anything as long as it is live.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Twitch started out for gamers, but now covers almost any live activity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s weird that Twitch exists. It is weirder that culture has sharpened to a point where Twitch is a thing. And weirder still that Twitch is now one of the biggest websites on earth, with up to 500,000 performers streaming live on the platform every day and more than 1 million users watching them at any one time. The set-up, if you\u2019re unfamiliar, is this: you point a webcam at yourself and, as long as you remain more-or-less clothed, you are free to broadcast yourself doing whatever it is you do. People can watch for free, subscribe for a small monthly support- the-artist style fee, or just throw money at them in the form of credits, a digital version of pelting wads of cash at a street performer.</p> <p>Twitch started as a portal to stream games and people-watching-people-playing-video games is still central to the essence of what it is. But in the eight years since it started, the platform has evolved and mutated, a synonymous call and response with the community that helps shape and support it. So now you can stream yourself cooking, for instance, or getting ready to go out, or playing poker, or walking around a city with a GoPro attached to a special rod, whispering, chatting. If you can do it and a camera can be pointed at it, then Twitch can host it. And people will watch it.</p> <p>Where this differs from other online video platforms is the sheer aliveness of it. If YouTube is for the jump-cut blockbuster movie versions of reality, then Twitch revels in the mediocrity, in the burble of half- conversation. It\u2019s reality without all the boring bits edited out \u2013 conversational lulls where a person talking to themselves alone in a room finally runs out of steam; gaps in the broadcast where someone goes out-of-shot to eat their dinner or go to the loo; mic-silences where someone\u2019s mum walks into shot to have a dull, administrative mum conversation with them.

He cites a number of streamers he prefers to watch with completely made up names that I\u2019m too afraid to go back to ask him to clarify in case he laughs at me.

      "bodyText": "Chris \u201cSacriel\u201d Ball\u2019s computer is worth \u00a320,000 and looms over me like a monolith. It is a completely silent machine, an alien spacecraft, and pulses with orange-yellow tubes of coolant, which keep the graphics card and motherboard from melting out of it like an ice pop. This machine is used to kill people: three, so far, today, but there will be countless more over the next eight hours. Behind there\u2019s a looming greenscreen, as though Ball is an especially violent weather presenter; in front, a bank of four computer screens, each streaming an unending loop of information. Ball is a gaming streamer. He started seven years ago on YouTube, then pivoted to Twitch. And now it supports him and a team of over 20. His house is the most beautiful home I\u2019ve ever been to. His kitchen is a palace and his dogs are adorable. I wonder briefly if anyone would pay to watch me play Fortnite in just my pants, and what dark, awful things I would do with the ensuing wealth. Ball specialises in tactical combat games where he chillingly explodes the heads of hundreds of competing gamers, and 507 people are watching him do it right now. They are following his antics through Twitch, a website where you can watch people doing things. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the entire concept. It feeds live from people\u2019s living rooms, bedrooms and dedicated gaming rooms, out to thousands of devices at once. If YouTube is a Fast &amp; Furious-style summer blockbuster, Twitch is the concurrent Big Brother equivalent: live cameras, often at a fixed and unflattering angles, revelling in conversational silence. Though it started out as primarily for gamers, the site has since evolved into a teeming community with people existing, doing, being on camera, and essentially performing anything as long as it is live. It\u2019s weird that Twitch exists. It is weirder that culture has sharpened to a point where Twitch is a thing. And weirder still that Twitch is now one of the biggest websites on earth, with up to 500,000 performers streaming live on the platform every day and more than 1 million users watching them at any one time. The set-up, if you\u2019re unfamiliar, is this: you point a webcam at yourself and, as long as you remain more-or-less clothed, you are free to broadcast yourself doing whatever it is you do. People can watch for free, subscribe for a small monthly support- the-artist style fee, or just throw money at them in the form of credits, a digital version of pelting wads of cash at a street performer. Twitch started as a portal to stream games and people-watching-people-playing-video games is still central to the essence of what it is. But in the eight years since it started, the platform has evolved and mutated, a synonymous call and response with the community that helps shape and support it. So now you can stream yourself cooking, for instance, or getting ready to go out, or playing poker, or walking around a city with a GoPro attached to a special rod, whispering, chatting. If you can do it and a camera can be pointed at it, then Twitch can host it. And people will watch it. Where this differs from other online video platforms is the sheer aliveness of it. If YouTube is for the jump-cut blockbuster movie versions of reality, then Twitch revels in the mediocrity, in the burble of half- conversation. It\u2019s reality without all the boring bits edited out \u2013 conversational lulls where a person talking to themselves alone in a room finally runs out of steam; gaps in the broadcast where someone goes out-of-shot to eat their dinner or go to the loo; mic-silences where someone\u2019s mum walks into shot to have a dull, administrative mum conversation with them. And that\u2019s how Twitch elevates from something that, on paper, should be entirely mediocre, but in practice becomes something that\u2019s half-entertainment, half-therapeutic. I never thought I\u2019d become the kind of person who watches other people play video games: some things, like hard drugs or drag racing, you always assume you are too sensible for. But after a particularly life-uprooting break-up and a period of at-home confinement while I wrote a book, I found myself bizarrely drawn to Twitch, the soothing hypnotism of watching mostly silently men down energy drinks and kill other players, bathed in the blue light of their computer screens.

He had spent almost a month in hospital, where he was being treated for injuries sustained during the incident on 6 August.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, officials said the boy had been hit by a stone thrown by protesters. Asrar\u2019s cousin, who was present at the time, said there had been no stone pelting in the area. The family produced records that described pellet, shell and blast injuries as the cause of death.</p> \n<p>Ajit Doval, India\u2019s national security adviser, said on Saturday that Asrar\u2019s death was unfortunate but demonstrated that the situation was largely peaceful. \u201cIf there\u2019s one incident that has taken place, that\u2019s good,\u201d he said, according to the Associated Press. \u201cZero would be better, but one is good.\u201d</p> \n<p>Media outlets have documented accounts from several other families who allege their relatives died due to the actions of security forces. It is not clear if the Indian authorities have changed their position regarding the circumstances in which Asrar died.</p> \n<p>His death, the first to be confirmed by the authorities, has intensified scrutiny of Indian officials, who have maintained that the situation in Kashmir is returning to normal. His father, Firdaus Ahmad Khan, said he wanted punishment for his son\u2019s killers. \u201cThe government is a liar. He was not hit by a stone but they killed him,\u201d he told the Guardian last week.</p> \n<p>Tens of thousands of extra troops were deployed to Kashmir ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\">revocation of the region\u2019s special status</a> on 5 August, when strict curfews were imposed, apparently to prevent unrest.<strong> </strong>On Sunday, restrictions in Srinagar were raised to their most severe levels since the clampdown began, as Shia Muslims observed an annual day of mourning. Mobile and internet services remain suspended across the Kashmir valley, home to around 7 million people. Only some landlines have been restored.

Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The human rights group Amnesty International India has raised serious concerns about the continued communication blackout in Kashmir, warning that it has given the government \u201ca near-total control of all information coming out of Kashmir\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis raises grave concerns of human rights violations that may occur yet remain unreported,\u201d the group said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79c34c9c3e91086a66611d72105c858b04bb8fd0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79c34c9c3e91086a66611d72105c858b04bb8fd0/150_0_3624_2176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An x-ray of skull of Asrar Ahmad Khan\u2019s skull\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An x-ray of Asrar\u2019s skull.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Asrar had been playing carrom, a table-top sports game, and then cricket, at a park near his home in Elahi Bagh on the outskirts of Kashmir\u2019s main city, Srinagar, on 6 August, according to his family.</p> \n<p>Two witnesses \u2013 Asrar\u2019s best friend Muqeet, and his cousin Adil \u2013 said a convoy of eight paramilitary vehicles had entered the neighbourhood.

      "bodyText": "The father of a teenager killed in Kashmir has demanded justice for his son, after witnesses said he was fired at with pellets and teargas in an unprovoked attack by Indian security forces. Asrar Ahmad Khan, described as a shy and studious teenager, died last week 11 days before his 18th birthday. He had spent almost a month in hospital, where he was being treated for injuries sustained during the incident on 6 August. On Wednesday, officials said the boy had been hit by a stone thrown by protesters. Asrar\u2019s cousin, who was present at the time, said there had been no stone pelting in the area. The family produced records that described pellet, shell and blast injuries as the cause of death. Ajit Doval, India\u2019s national security adviser, said on Saturday that Asrar\u2019s death was unfortunate but demonstrated that the situation was largely peaceful. \u201cIf there\u2019s one incident that has taken place, that\u2019s good,\u201d he said, according to the Associated Press. \u201cZero would be better, but one is good.\u201d Media outlets have documented accounts from several other families who allege their relatives died due to the actions of security forces. It is not clear if the Indian authorities have changed their position regarding the circumstances in which Asrar died. His death, the first to be confirmed by the authorities, has intensified scrutiny of Indian officials, who have maintained that the situation in Kashmir is returning to normal. His father, Firdaus Ahmad Khan, said he wanted punishment for his son\u2019s killers. \u201cThe government is a liar. He was not hit by a stone but they killed him,\u201d he told the Guardian last week. Tens of thousands of extra troops were deployed to Kashmir ahead of the revocation of the region\u2019s special status on 5 August, when strict curfews were imposed, apparently to prevent unrest. On Sunday, restrictions in Srinagar were raised to their most severe levels since the clampdown began, as Shia Muslims observed an annual day of mourning. Mobile and internet services remain suspended across the Kashmir valley, home to around 7 million people. Only some landlines have been restored. Thousands of people have reportedly been detained. The human rights group Amnesty International India has raised serious concerns about the continued communication blackout in Kashmir, warning that it has given the government \u201ca near-total control of all information coming out of Kashmir\u201d. \u201cThis raises grave concerns of human rights violations that may occur yet remain unreported,\u201d the group said. Asrar had been playing carrom, a table-top sports game, and then cricket, at a park near his home in Elahi Bagh on the outskirts of Kashmir\u2019s main city, Srinagar, on 6 August, according to his family. Two witnesses \u2013 Asrar\u2019s best friend Muqeet, and his cousin Adil \u2013 said a convoy of eight paramilitary vehicles had entered the neighbourhood. Two of them had stopped near the corner of the park. The paramilitaries inside the two vehicles then fired a teargas smoke shell into the park, they said. \u201cThe shell tossed Asrar in the head and then they fired a burst of pellets towards him,\u201d Adil, who had played the last carrom game with his teenage cousin, told the Guardian. \u201cThere was no stone-pelting in the area,\u201d he said. Adil and a neighbourhood friend rushed Asrar on a bike to the Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences. It is near-impossible to call for an ambulance because of the communications blackout.

Asrar immediately underwent an operation and was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. Under the advice of doctors, Asrar\u2019s family played him his favourite music, a collection of Sufi mystic songs, as he lay unconscious. He died at 8.15pm on 3 September, a hospital certificate said. The cause of death, according to the certificate shown to the Guardian by his family, was \u201cpellet injury with shell blast injury\u201d.

This included plans being worked up on technological \u201cpossibilities\u201d on the Northern Irish border to avoid using the backstop arrangement.</p> \n<p>Asked by Ridge if the prime minister would ignore the legislation passed in parliament asking him to seek a delay to Brexit, Raab said the government would test its legality to the limits and could not rule out that a legal challenge would be brought in the future.</p> \n<p>He said the prime minister was absolutely committed to not asking Brussels for an extension.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe will adhere to the law but also this is such a bad piece of legislation \u2026 we will also want to test to the limit what it does actually lawfully require. We will look very carefully at the implications and our interpretation of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The court challenge may come from outside government, he added. \u201cWe can\u2019t necessarily control that,\u201d he said, on exactly who would bring a legal case. \u201cPeople at various points challenged the government over Brexit. We had two legal challenges last week alone and we won both of those,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>On whether the prime minister would resign rather than ask for an extension to Brexit, he ducked the question and said: \u201cWe are always going to behave lawfully as a government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Accusations that the prime minister\u2019s chief strategist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/conservatives-rising-anger-at-cummings-role-in-purge-of-brexit-rebels\">Dominic Cummings</a>, is not a Conservative party member were also batted away by Raab.</p> \n<p>Cummings has been blamed by many Tory MPs this week for the much stricter treatment of Brexit rebels and for narrowing down the party\u2019s appeal by focusing solely on leaving the EU.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.

The foreign secretary praised his party\u2019s whips for restoring discipline and said the 21 MPs had known the consequences when they voted against the government to \u201chand control\u201d of parliament to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Amber Rudd has become the latest high-profile party figure to desert Boris Johnson, resigning both from her cabinet role as work and pensions secretary and as a Conservative MP with stinging criticism of her party\u2019s drift towards no deal and the axing of colleagues.

That\u2019s the real vandalism to democracy that\u2019s going on \u2026 so I regret it and we need to keep the family together, but the prime minister was very clear.\u201d Rudd told the BBC on Sunday morning she felt she had little choice but to resign after colleagues had lost the whip for backing Hilary Benn\u2019s bill instructing the prime minister to ask for a delay to leaving the EU on 31 October and in effect blocking a no-deal departure. \u201cI know I couldn\u2019t carry on in the Conservative party at such a high level and see 21 of my colleagues who are good, moderate people, who also want a deal, excluded from it, and I just needed to move and stand by them,\u201d she told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show. She said there was a \u201chuge machine\u201d preparing for a no-deal Brexit, which was taking up \u201c80-90% of government time\u201d, but when she had asked No 10 this week for an update on the work going into the negotiations, she had been sent a one-page summary. \u201cThere is a huge amount of planning and preparation around no deal. I have attended a number of those meetings. We are really stepping it up, which is the right thing to do, but I have not seen enough work going into actually trying to get a deal.\u201d Rudd said she did not regret joining Johnson\u2019s cabinet, which required signing up to his plan to leave the EU by 31 October, come what may. \u201cI entered in good faith, had frank conversations with the PM, and when I said I supported him on his strategy I was absolutely genuine.\u201d Raab said his former cabinet colleague had signed up to Johnson\u2019s plan to leave the EU at the end of October come what may, and that extensive no-deal planning was crucial to getting a deal, but that the government was also working on solutions to present to the EU. This included plans being worked up on technological \u201cpossibilities\u201d on the Northern Irish border to avoid using the backstop arrangement. Asked by Ridge if the prime minister would ignore the legislation passed in parliament asking him to seek a delay to Brexit, Raab said the government would test its legality to the limits and could not rule out that a legal challenge would be brought in the future. He said the prime minister was absolutely committed to not asking Brussels for an extension. He said: \u201cWe will adhere to the law but also this is such a bad piece of legislation \u2026 we will also want to test to the limit what it does actually lawfully require. We will look very carefully at the implications and our interpretation of it.\u201d The court challenge may come from outside government, he added. \u201cWe can\u2019t necessarily control that,\u201d he said, on exactly who would bring a legal case. \u201cPeople at various points challenged the government over Brexit. We had two legal challenges last week alone and we won both of those,\u201d he said. On whether the prime minister would resign rather than ask for an extension to Brexit, he ducked the question and said: \u201cWe are always going to behave lawfully as a government.\u201d Accusations that the prime minister\u2019s chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, is not a Conservative party member were also batted away by Raab. Cummings has been blamed by many Tory MPs this week for the much stricter treatment of Brexit rebels and for narrowing down the party\u2019s appeal by focusing solely on leaving the EU. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to ask him.\u201d",

Two years ago, prices were rising much faster than wages because the post-referendum fall in the pound was making imports dearer. That has now switched around: the lowest unemployment since the mid-1970s is putting upward pressure on wages and leading to increases \u2013 albeit modest \u2013 in living standards. In the upcoming poll, expect the Tories to cherry pick the best bits of their economic record, ignoring the food banks, the cuts in welfare and the proliferation of zero-hours contracts. Last week\u2019s spending announcement did not by any means make good the cuts imposed over the past decade but it was the biggest increase in departmental budgets in 15 years. Just as significantly, it deprives Corbyn of the clear-cut narrative that proved effective in 2017: Tory austerity versus Labour investment in the state. Corbyn\u2019s other great success in 2017 was to neutralise Brexit as a factor in the election. By saying that Labour would abide by the result of the referendum, he managed to hold on to most of the seats Labour was defending in leave-voting parts of Britain while at the same time making gains in remain-voting areas. Quite a lot of voters took a shine to Corbyn and rather liked Labour\u2019s manifesto, which was both radical and unthreatening. May\u2019s ineptitude as a campaigner was an added bonus. To win an overall majority Labour would need to win more than 60 seats as well as holding on to the ones it currently holds. Given that most of the key battles will be in leave-voting seats in England and Wales, this looks like a tall order. Two years ago, when May lost her overall majority, it really was a matter of \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d. But, this \u2013 as witnessed by Harold Wilson\u2019s victory when Britain was booming in 1964 \u2013 is not always the case. Brexit will dominate the coming election in a way it didn\u2019t in 2017 and Johnson\u2019s message of \u201cthe people v parliament\u2019\u201d is a lot easier to understand than Labour\u2019s fudge.",

After two years of military service he studied law in Budapest, and then political science at Pembroke College, Oxford.<br></p>\n    <p>For nationalists across Europe, Orb\u00e1n has become a hero, the embodiment of a nativist leader willing to eschew liberal political correctness and speak aggressively about the need to defend so-called Christian Europe. Steve Bannon has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/opinion/steve-bannon-europe-movement-far-right.html\">called him Trump before Trump</a>, and Nigel Farage and Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini are admirers.<br></p>\n    <p>For many liberals, and increasingly for some of his supposed allies in the EPP, he signifies all that is rotten, corrupt and downright scary in contemporary politics on the continent.</p>\n    <p>\u201cThe age of liberal democracy is at an end,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told the Hungarian parliament shortly after Fidesz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/hungary-liberals-torrid-four-years-viktor-orban-landslide\">won</a> a third successive electoral victory in 2018. \u201cIt is no longer able to protect people\u2019s dignity, provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture.\u201d</p>\n    <p>His messaging, repeated in speeches and interviews ad nauseam, is that he is on a mission to protect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hungary\">Hungary</a> and the rest of Europe from the evils of migration from the Middle East and Africa. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/22/hungary-viktor-orban-george-soros\">frequently accused</a> the Hungarian-born financier George Soros of a conspiracy to overrun Europe with Muslim migrants.</p>\n    <p>Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian parliament, which gives him leeway to make sweeping constitutional changes, and he has spoken of a plan to reshape the country over the next decade.

Awarded the low-profile portfolio of education, culture, youth and sport, Navracsics had to walk a tightrope between Brussels and Budapest. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to operate in a situation where everyone in Brussels and everyone in Budapest is waiting for the slightest sign where they can say you have betrayed them,\u201d said one diplomatic source. \u201cA lot of people in Budapest were saying he had become a brainwashed liberal, whereas right from the beginning he faced a hostile environment in the commission.\u201d As his possible successor, Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi will face the same scepticism from both sides. The former diplomat is not seen as a close ally of Orb\u00e1n: \u201cHe is an extremely talented expert, a professional executor and legal framer of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s will,\u201d the source said. \u201cAnd I think that is how Orb\u00e1n looks at him, as a legal tool.\u201d Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi said he was \u201cdelighted that president-elect Ursula von der Leyen considers me in her future team. It is a great honour.\u201d He declined to comment on the criticism from the MEPs, or his portfolio.",

In the case of the Portuguese wineries, both already had good reputations for quality. All they wanted to do was to keep giving consumers great wine at a good price, without degrading their soil. They hadn\u2019t increased the cost of making wine as they shifted to organic practice. Their management was concerned that introducing the organic designation would lead consumers to question the quality of their wine. They also feared that if they raised their prices to meet the expectation that organic wine costs more, they risked making their wine unaffordable to their current customers. Why rock the boat?

Evans was amazed when he discovered this while working with the manufacturer and asked if he could tell the world. It refused, not because the innovations were trade secrets, or because it risked losing a cost-saving competitive edge (due to cheap electricity prices, the cost saving amounted to less than 1%), but because the management was worried that to flag one area of innovation in the business for praise might attract unwanted attention to parts of its operation that were less sustainable, potentially sparking accusations of \u201cgreen-washing\u201d. </p> <p>Evans claims that, in business-to-business transactions, there may be even less incentive to advertise sustainable practices.

For companies championing a given innovation, it\u2019s an unnecessary risk: you are unlikely to get any other business customers to sign up based on your sustainability credentials, but you might spook those who fear an increased cost being passed on to them.

It was built in the 1920s for art patrons Charles and Marie-Laure de Noailles, who knew all the best artists and designers of the time (Picasso painted her portrait). While I was there, they were holding a festival called <a href=\"https://villanoailles-hyeres.com/en/festivals/design-parade-hyeres\" title=\"\">Design Parade</a> [until 29 September] between the villa and Toulon.

I don\u2019t have kids, but anyone who does should definitely take them to this. It\u2019s interactive and playful in a really nerdy, smart way. Eliasson is one of my favourite artists: his <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series/unilever-series-olafur-eliasson-weather-project-0\" title=\"\">Weather Project</a> in 2003, with the big sun, was one of the best-ever Turbine Hall installations. The way people interacted with that work, lying down on the floor and so on, was echoed here. I loved the fog room so much I queued twice to experience it. You can feel Eliasson\u2019s humanity in this exhibition \u2013 there\u2019s something really warm about it.</p> <h2>3.

There\u2019s something romantic about it \u2013 it feels a bit lost in time, with its vintage plates and cutlery that remind me of my grandma and the little white roadside flowers they put on the tables. Everything comes from the heart, and the Mediterranean-style food and wine are really delicious. One time I ordered confit garlic with goat\u2019s cheese and it came with a whole head of garlic, which I ate by myself. Going here on a sunny morning during the week (I try to avoid the weekend because it\u2019s so busy), you feel like you\u2019re somewhere else, not in London.

It\u2019s a small festival in a field, with just 800 people, organised by a group of friends. They don\u2019t want any branding, they\u2019re just doing it for the love of making people dance. They get brilliant dance-music DJs, many of them women \u2013 the line-up this year included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/04/the-black-madonna-favourite-tracks\" title=\"\">the Black Madonna</a> and Eris Drew.

      "bodyText": "Camille Walala, 44, is a designer whose striking use of pattern and colour spans her textiles, interiors, installations and civic artworks. Born in Provence, she studied textile design at the University of Brighton and established Studio Walala in 2009 in east London, where she now lives. Her work draws from influences as broad as the Memphis Group (an eye-popping Italian design movement in the 80s) and African tribal patterns. From 14 to 22 September, Walala will transform Mayfair\u2019s South Molton Street into an open-air living room, Walala Lounge, for the London Design festival. 1. Architecture Villa Noailles, Hy\u00e8res, France Going back to see my family in Provence this summer, I visited this amazing early-modernist villa near Toulon. It was built in the 1920s for art patrons Charles and Marie-Laure de Noailles, who knew all the best artists and designers of the time (Picasso painted her portrait). While I was there, they were holding a festival called Design Parade [until 29 September] between the villa and Toulon. It was really nicely curated, with beautiful design, but the main attraction for me was the villa itself, its wonderful garden and the view over the town of Hy\u00e8res. 2. Art Olafur Eliasson, Tate Modern I was amazed by this exhibition at the Tate. I don\u2019t have kids, but anyone who does should definitely take them to this. It\u2019s interactive and playful in a really nerdy, smart way. Eliasson is one of my favourite artists: his Weather Project in 2003, with the big sun, was one of the best-ever Turbine Hall installations. The way people interacted with that work, lying down on the floor and so on, was echoed here. I loved the fog room so much I queued twice to experience it. You can feel Eliasson\u2019s humanity in this exhibition \u2013 there\u2019s something really warm about it. 3. Restaurant Towpath Cafe, London N1 I love this little canal-side cafe in Islington, which opens in spring and summer. There\u2019s something romantic about it \u2013 it feels a bit lost in time, with its vintage plates and cutlery that remind me of my grandma and the little white roadside flowers they put on the tables. Everything comes from the heart, and the Mediterranean-style food and wine are really delicious. One time I ordered confit garlic with goat\u2019s cheese and it came with a whole head of garlic, which I ate by myself. Going here on a sunny morning during the week (I try to avoid the weekend because it\u2019s so busy), you feel like you\u2019re somewhere else, not in London. It\u2019s a comforting place to go to. 4. Festival Field Maneuvers, Oxfordshire Once a year I need to have a big dance, to get it out of my system, so I go to this three-day festival just north of Oxford. It\u2019s a small festival in a field, with just 800 people, organised by a group of friends. They don\u2019t want any branding, they\u2019re just doing it for the love of making people dance. They get brilliant dance-music DJs, many of them women \u2013 the line-up this year included the Black Madonna and Eris Drew. There\u2019s a lovely feeling of community and I always end up bumping into people I know. It\u2019s like reuniting with a big family. 5. Podcast Justyna Green I\u2019ve been listening to this design podcast for a while, and just yesterday I went on as a guest. Justyna Green is a communications consultant who has conversations with artists and designers and other people in that world \u2013 such as Marcus Fairs from Dezeen, Hugo Macdonald and Morag Myerscough. It\u2019s very easygoing and fluid, and it was nice to be interviewed by her \u2013 she asks good questions that don\u2019t sound scripted, even though a lot of thought must have gone into them. Listening to it, you find out little details about people\u2019s lives, how they work, what they\u2019re into. It\u2019s quite intimate and personal, which I like. 6. Music The Golden Filter A friend introduced me to this duo a few years ago. They\u2019re an Australian-American couple, Penelope Trappes and Stephen Hindman, who are now based in London and make amazing electronic music. He plays drums and synths and she sings with a really beautiful voice. I try to see them whenever they\u2019re playing and there\u2019s always an interesting mix of people, young and old, at their gigs. She is quite petite but wears a massive blonde wig and has a stunning presence. It\u2019s really nice to see a couple on stage with such a great chemistry between them.

      "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"http://michaelwerner.com/exhibition/5790/information\" title=\"\">Peter Doig</a></strong>\u2019s latest paintings are as bewitching as ever \u2013 but even stranger. Given that lingering mystery has been the uppermost trait of his art for more than 30 years, this is no small feat. Many of his motifs remain the same, what is more \u2013 lone divers, solitary figures on glowing shorelines, curious birds, the scorching streets and blue shadows of Trinidad, where Doig has lived since 2002 \u2013 yet their significance has deepened with time, like recurring characters in a long sequence of novels.</p> <p>A blue pierrot is partially visible in the deep fronds of the forest. A bather comes up to a beach at dusk, the sea like moire silk behind him. Three figures in antique costumes, one in a tricorn hat, two holding guitars, stand ready for some outlandish performance to begin. Watteau in the jungle.</p> <p>At 60, Doig has long since made the Lion of Judah his own, releasing the beast into the haunts of his art. In the past, it has been a Rastafarian yellow. Now it lurks outside the prison in Port of Spain, a burning high-visibility orange. The spectral face of a lifer appears at a barred window above, the lion a beacon of his lost freedom.</p> <p>But now it appears, in another painting, abruptly close to the foreground as if by cinematic jump-cut. This time the creature basks in freeze-frame, dominating the burning yellow boulevard like a floating vignette. The image lies somewhere between memory, dream and hypnotic trance. It feels as if the scene were already in your head, somehow, and Doig\u2019s gift was to free it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9cf9b76ed796bb06324cc1cd3dcdb41d41493b6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cf9b76ed796bb06324cc1cd3dcdb41d41493b6c/0_0_1922_2400/801.jpg\" alt=\"Bather (Night Wave), 2019 by Peter Doig.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018St Elmo\u2019s fire flickers round his mythical face\u2019: Bather (Night Wave), 2019 by Peter Doig.<em> </em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Peter Doig/DACS/courtesy Michael Werner Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost as familiar as the lion, by now, is his musclebound bather in old-fashioned trunks. Doig found an old photograph of Robert Mitchum posing on a beach during filming in Trinidad. The original figure metamorphoses into a strongman fit for Picasso, then becomes a modernist colossus on blond sands. But at night the beach turns bitter orange, surf rises in spectral surges beneath a crescent moon and the bather is a ghost, St Elmo\u2019s fire flickering round his mythical face. Not the least pleasure of this enthralling show is this sense of narratives building between the works.</p> <p>Everywhere you see traces of the artists Doig admires: Chagall\u2019s flying figures brought down to earth in a painting of a postman pushing a white-beard along a street lit with eerie phosphorescent blossoms. A solitary lighthouse arrives out of De Chirico. There are hints of the yellow house at Arles, and of its tenants Gauguin and Van Gogh \u2013 all as inherent and fundamental as the landscape itself, or the washes of atmospheric distemper that steep the canvas, somehow coexisting with incidents in high-chrome oil.</p> <p>Doig is a tremendous shape-maker himself. Even just a shadow thrown on water between two luminescent green trees takes on an almost human force of personality. Leaves rhyme with bananas, and vice versa. The figure of a diver fishing for the electric squiggle of fish is as indelible as Superman, yet strangely diaphanous. How is it that his legs are visible through a bar of liquid green, while the lower body of a girl next to him is not? And where has she come from, in her wintry cagoule?</p> <p>A picture may be painted in several different idioms and registers. A nearly abstract stretch of wall will be pierced with the meticulous description of a door. Objects in the distance can seem sharper than those in the foreground. People in contemporary dress appear puzzlingly ancient. Small canvases skim images from the Trinidad streets \u2013 figures pressing towards the viewer \u2013 only to lose them in the hot night. Vast canvases fuse past and present like modern legends: behind the enormous bather is a blue shadow wrestling a leviathan.</p> <p>Each work invites you to solve its pictorial mystery, which sometimes seems nearly possible. A huge painting of an opalescent beach shows figures lying at intervals on the sands \u2013 a blue odalisque with hair like leaves, two pink palms glimmering on the shoreline. The scene is sumptuous yet diaphanous: Doig is painting the curious moonlight. But what then is that strange glowing oblong that hangs over the waves, rivalling the planetary moon? This shape holds fast, casting a light of its own, shifting the picture into another dimension \u2013 not a seascape so much as an indelible vision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"219c53fa45ad4800c6e71ba895162adab2fe2905\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/219c53fa45ad4800c6e71ba895162adab2fe2905/100_191_2797_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kiss (Odysseus &amp; Calypso), 2019, by Chris Ofili.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A Caribbean homage to Klimt\u2019: Kiss (Odysseus &amp; Calypso), 2019, by Chris Ofili.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Arca/\u00a9 Chris Ofili/courtesy the artist and David Zwirner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Commercial gallerists\u2019 shows serve a useful purpose, allowing admirers, as well as collectors, to keep abreast of their artists\u2019 latest work.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Dear Ms Paltrow,\u2019 began Dr Jen Gunter\u2019s <a href=\"https://drjengunter.com/2017/01/17/dear-gwyneth-paltrow-im-a-gyn-and-your-vaginal-jade-eggs-are-a-bad-idea/\" title=\"\">open letter</a> of 2017, regarding the jade eggs Paltrow was promoting on her website <a href=\"https://goop.com/uk\" title=\"\">Goop</a>. Paltrow claimed that inserting one into the vagina would improve a woman\u2019s life, in at least four ways. \u201cIt is the biggest load of garbage I have read on your site since vaginal steaming. It\u2019s even worse than claiming bras cause cancer. But hey, you aren\u2019t one to let facts get in the way of profiting from snake oil.\u201d And so it began. It was a war on wellness \u2013 an industry now worth more than $4.2tn (\u00a33.5tn) \u2013 and every battle went viral, leading to Gunter becoming the most famous gynaecologist in the world.</p> <p>When one of Goop\u2019s \u201cmedical experts\u201d wrote that Gunter was \u201cstrangely confident\u201d in her thoughts on jade eggs, she replied: \u201cI am not strangely confident about vaginal health; I am appropriately confident because I am the expert.\u201d Many of her statements end with similar mic drops.

Confusion that results in (as a <a href=\"https://eveappeal.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Eve-Appeal-Vagina-Dialogues.pdf\" title=\"\">2016 study</a> revealed) only 56% of British women being able to locate the vagina on a diagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96fe3250d794a614df44efe2a951d31525e589c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96fe3250d794a614df44efe2a951d31525e589c6/429_145_1930_1158/1000.jpg\" alt=\"in goop Health SummitNEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 27: Gwyneth Paltrow attends the in goop Health Summit on January 27, 2018 in New York City.

The former manipulates that confusion to take women\u2019s money, the latter to take their power. \u201cI even started to notice overlap between the language,\u201d she says with a shudder. \u201cThe anti-science views of wellness and the anti-science of the religious right. Themes like \u2018purity\u2019 and \u2018cleanliness\u2019 with their similar rituals. It\u2019s predatory. It\u2019s the patriarchy by another name. And it keeps women back by telling them lies about their body. They might be different lies, but the effect is the same.\u201d It is her responsibility, she says, with something like a sigh, to \u201cstep up\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Canada, it wasn\u2019t until the late 1990s when Gunter moved to the US and started working in Kansas that she had a \u201cpolitical awakening\u201d \u2013 quote marks her own. A patient had a medical condition that was deteriorating rapidly because of her pregnancy. Except, abortions on state property had just been made illegal unless it was a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d; the hospital\u2019s attorney said if Gunter performed one she would be fired. So, she called the legislator who wrote the law, who breezily told her to do what she thought best. She was furious. Furious at the man applauding a law in public while deferring to her expertise in private, furious that she\u2019d have to defend herself if she\u2019d been arrested and furious at the knowledge that women will die if these laws remain.</p> <p>Something shifted in Gunter. Her work started to expand beyond the hospital walls \u2013 she\u2019d see ripples relating to women\u2019s health in the tabloid press, in presidential debate. Celebrity trends would leak into the anxieties of her patients, her own personal life became political. In 2003, pregnant with triplets, her waters broke far too early. The next day she delivered her 1lb baby alone in a hospital bathroom. He lived for three minutes. After later giving birth to two sons with severe health complications, she quit obstetrics.</p> <p>The experiences traumatised and awakened her. One of her sons has cerebral palsy. \u201cAt some point, someone will discover the science behind it, and we\u2019ll see if we can fix it. The operations my sons had when they were babies were a lesson that there\u2019s just some things in medicine they don\u2019t have answers for yet.\u201d Or, as she realised: \u201cThere are no miracles, there\u2019s just undiscovered science.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These sites offer you that emotional connection that doctors often jumped. And I think that\u2019s a big fault of medicine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which is one of the reasons she understands the impact of sites like Goop. As a doctor she knew that scrolling for cures was a waste of time, but as a parent she wanted to believe in magic. \u201cThese sites offer you that emotional connection that doctors often jumped. And I think that\u2019s a big fault of medicine. When I trained, we were taught that you don\u2019t talk about yourself with patients, you keep a stiff upper lip. But part of my success comes from people wanting their doctor to be a human. They want their doctor to be authentic. They want to know their doctor cares for them.\u201d</p> <p>Her authenticity arrives like this, in bloody stories of personal trauma, used in tandem with her expertise to bolster arguments about science, but also in more unexpected places. For instance, in <em>The Vagina Bible</em> (a book whose ads were blocked on Twitter because its algorithm flags \u201cvulgar, obscene or distasteful\u201d words) her advice on pubic hair removal is based around the detail that she rarely has a clean razor and she refers, cuttingly, to an ex who told her that her vagina smelled. Facts are important to her \u2013 crystals are bullshit, you should not put glitter in your vagina, razors get blunt. But facts aren\u2019t enough and Gunter\u2019s skill is in her rawness, her frankness about her own experiences and the way she takes celebrity trends apart like oranges, spitting out pips.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I realised that people were believing Goop\u2019s fairy tales, I thought: \u2018I\u2019ll take them on.\u2019\u201d The first anti-Goop post she wrote, on vaginal steaming, centred around the idea that women have long been believed to be unclean. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the core beliefs of the patriarchy. That women are dirty inside. And yet Goop presents this as female empowerment? In Hippocrates\u2019s time they used to think that the womb wandered the body, causing mayhem, and you would coax it back into place by putting fragrant herbs between the legs. This is the same thing. It\u2019s in so many cultures, this belief that the uterus is toxic. I couldn\u2019t believe it was now being presented as female empowerment. It\u2019s bad feminism. And it\u2019s bad science.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, she went to the Goop summit. \u201cUnder my real name, of course. I mean, my whole thing is like, \u2018the truth\u2019, right?\u201d She chuckles darkly. \u201cThere were three talks on how death isn\u2019t real. Apparently when you die, you can use love in your brain to bring you back from the dead. Did you know that? One of the speakers said love cured her cancer, but neglected to tell everybody she\u2019d also had chemotherapy. She said she got cancer because she was \u2018afraid of getting cancer\u2019. That was a very common theme, that fear is the cause of the illness, and that love is the cure.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That was a very common theme, that fear is the cause of the illness, and that love is the cure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a <em>New York Times</em> column, Gunter showed that cancer patients who seek out alternative remedies are more likely to die sooner, because relying on, say, \u201clove\u201d, means they delay medical treatment. \u201cApart from anything, it\u2019s so insulting to anybody who\u2019s ever had an illness, right, that you somehow created it yourself?\u201d Her small bursts of fury are thrilling. She bangs her glass.</p> <p>At the Goop summit, a medium came into the audience where Gunter was sitting, and called out questions. \u201c\u2018Has anyone in the room thought about buying a handbag?\u2019 I mean, we\u2019re in a room full of rich women. \u2018Does anyone like shoes?\u2019 And they were eating it up. They were eating it up.\u201d Later, musing on Goop\u2019s love of mediums on her blog, she wondered: \u201cHow do ghosts have so much health information anyway? Are they all doctors?\u201d</p> <p>She was stunned, and yes, angry. \u201cPaltrow is able to call up any magazine in the world and get on the cover. And this is what she\u2019s doing with her privilege. Grifting off desperate women.\u201d</p> <p>Why does she think Paltrow does it? She pauses, thoughtful. \u201cSometimes people need to explain their success in a way that makes them feel better about themselves? Goop goes back to the fact that women have been destabilised by constantly being told they need to improve, along with the idea that they can have it all.\u201d Which now includes living forever and all the babies you want, and no pain, ever. \u201cIt\u2019s also about recognising the fact that the patriarchy has told them their emotions aren\u2019t valid. Like: you shouldn\u2019t cry when you\u2019re mad. I think Goop telling women that fear causes illness, that your emotions control you, preys on the societal belief that it\u2019s wrong to show emotion.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Goop telling women that fear causes illness, that your emotions control you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Would she like to sit down with Paltrow one day, have a conversation about, say, weaponising women\u2019s fears about femininity? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever get an answer that would be satisfying. People have had to spend money, just to prove her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/26/your-bra-could-kill-you-and-other-breast-cancer-myths-busted\" title=\"\">breast cancer bra</a> thing was false, money that could have been used to study something important. Many of the medical experts she publishes are part of the anti-vaccine world and post a lot of conspiracy theories. So, either it\u2019s a grift, or she\u2019s a true believer. As a \u2018feminist businesswoman\u2019 she\u2019s claimed the right to \u2018try out\u2019 being a reporter, and then, \u2018try out\u2019 being a doctor. It doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d</p> <p>Gunter smiles thinly. \u201cBut, you know, she\u2019s not the first.\u201d She leans back and tells a story about a man called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/23/nuts-review-animated-documentary-john-romulus-brinkley-goat-testicles\" title=\"\">John Brinkley</a>. Born in 1885, he took his \u201cmedicine show\u201d to rural towns, hawking a sex tonic. He bought a diploma in \u201ceclectic medicine\u201d and set up a business injecting coloured water into the veins of men concerned about their virility. After skipping town on a sea of debt, he opened a clinic where he transplanted goat testicles into people who were \u201csexually weak\u201d. \u201cHe was marketing to people with \u2018adrenal fatigue\u2019 \u2013 familiar, right? He made a lot of money very quickly, so bought off politicians and then bought the local radio station, so he controlled the media. It\u2019s not so different to what a celebrity will do today. The victims died as true believers.\u201d She shrugs.</p> <p>Has anything changed? \u201cI think more people are starting to ask questions. More people are starting to think, \u2018Who should I consider as an expert on a subject?\u2019 And, \u2018What does this person have to gain by giving me information?\u2019 I do think this has always been a constant in society. The difference is, we\u2019re becoming more aware of it now. And I think we\u2019re close to breaking through.\u201d</p> <p>She is veering away from Goop, partly because she\u2019s concentrating on things she sees as more important, like keeping abortion legal (\u201cPulling fetal skulls out of abdomens after clandestine abortions isn\u2019t something I want to do again\u201d) and partly because, ouch, \u201cit feels like punching down.\u201d Now Gunter wants to spend her time helping women understand their bodies, bringing down the patriarchy, and finishing her lunch. In no particular order.</p> <h2>Myths and medicine: an exclusive extract from the Vagina Bible</h2> <p><strong>Parsley in the vagina<br></strong>The sprig. Stuffed up the vagina each night for three to four nights to induce a period. Look, I don\u2019t make this stuff up, I just report on it. Apparently some people \u2014 people who are wrong \u2013 think it could stimulate uterine contractions. There is no evidence vaginal application of parsley can do that, but even if it could that would not make you have a period. Progesterone withdrawal causes a period, not uterine contractions.</p> <p><strong>Jade eggs for your \u2018yoni\u2019<br></strong>The idea is that you put an egg-shaped jade rock in your vagina and it puts you in tune with your feminine energy or something. Jade eggs were promoted as an ancient secret of Chinese concubines and queens. I researched this and published my data in a peer-reviewed medical journal \u2013 they are not. The only thing ancient about it is the absence of science.</p> <p><strong>Birth-control pills cause weight gain<br></strong>This has been well studied, and the answer is no. This is not disbelieving women; this is the exact opposite. This is taking what women report about weight gain and studying it. This data really reflects doctors listening to women. Several studies have shown no link between birth-control pills and weight gain. The life situation associated with starting new contraception may be associated with weight gain, but the pill is not.</p> <p><strong>Hormonal contraception causes \u2018infertility\u2019<br></strong>Nope, but the patriarchy trying to scare you away from controlling reproductive health is invested in this myth. Sadly, many \u2018natural\u2019 health proponents capitalise on this fear as well. With the injection, there can be a delay of several months of return to fertility, but by one year all women are back to baseline. With all other methods of contraception, once stopped or removed, you are good to go pregnancy-wise the next month.</p> <p><strong>Fancy water<br></strong>The latest is so-called \u2018alkaline water\u2019. Water has a pH of 7, and alkaline water has been modified so the pH is 8 or 9. This is an extension of the so-called alkaline diet, which has been promoted to \u2018neutralise the acid in your body\u2019 (medical gibberish) to treat just about everything, even as a treatment for cancer. IT\u2019S NOT. Why all caps? Because people have followed the alkaline diet for cancer and died. The man who wrote the book that helped popularise the alkaline trend was arrested for practising medicine without a licence and sentenced to three years and eight months in jail. This is a grift of epic proportions.</p> <p><strong>Magnets next to your vagina for hot flushes<br></strong>Sometimes I worry I am going to sprain my neck with my eye rolls writing about these and the \u2018science\u2019 *cough, cough* behind them.</p> <p><strong>Yogurt for yeast infections<br></strong>It doesn\u2019t contain the strains of lactobacilli that are important for vaginal health. When a woman puts yogurt in her vagina, she is putting other bacteria there and the consequences are unknown. It may feel soothing because it is cream-like, but the risks are unknown and it will be ineffective.</p> <p><strong>Coffee enemas<br></strong>Dear God, no. People, even some doctors, promote this to treat depression! I. Just. Can\u2019t. Even. Medically speaking, to believe coffee in your rectum could treat anything is ludicrous. I mean, why doesn\u2019t drinking it have the same effect? It is a rabbit hole of epic proportions.</p> <p><strong>Steaming the vagina<br></strong>This is promoted to \u2018cleanse\u2019 the uterus. This ties into a destructive myth that the uterus is unclean or that a period is cleaning the uterus. The idea of a toxin-filled uterus is literally used by many cultures to exclude women from society \u2013 it\u2019s a defining characteristic of the patriarchy. So telling women this exists is promoting a patriarchal idea.</p> <p><strong>Final thoughts<br></strong>Power and health are linked. You can\u2019t be an empowered patient and get the health outcomes you want with inaccurate information and half-truths. I\u2019ve been attacked for coming out against the misinformation and disinformation that are presented to women as worthy of consideration. True choice \u2013 weighing your personal risk-benefit ratio and making a decision for your body based on that information \u2013 requires facts. And it is this quest to give women facts that keeps me up at night. It is why I keep fighting. The patriarchy and snake oil have had a good run, but I\u2019m done with how they negatively affect and weaponise women\u2019s health. So I am not going to stop swinging my bat until everyone has the tools to be an empowered patient and those who seek to subjugate women by keeping them from facts about their bodies have shut up and taken a seat in the back of class. That\u2019s my vagenda.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2019 to clarify an aspect of abortion law in the US.</p> <p><em>The Vagina Bible by Dr Jennifer Gunter (Little Brown, \u00a314.99) is out now.

I thought, I\u2019m not celebrating my birthday in a middle seat, you know?\u201d Though she became famous for her sharp criticisms of Paltrow (the jade egg scandal led to a lawsuit against Goop\u2019s marketing), she has branched out from bodies and blogging, with two columns in the New York Times, a web series that unpicks health myths and a new book, The Vagina Bible. The book is already a bestseller, a sign there is a need for her expertise; last month a 62-year-old woman was hospitalised with second-degree burns after steaming her vagina. But it\u2019s not just Goop that Gunter is called to comment on \u2013 her knowledge is required daily, whether to debunk Teen Vogue\u2019s advice on how to achieve a \u201csummer vagina\u201d, anti-vaxxers, or to illuminate the way confusion around women\u2019s bodies fuels political efforts to control them. Confusion that results in (as a 2016 study revealed) only 56% of British women being able to locate the vagina on a diagram. Pouring a glass of water, Gunter argues that the wellness industry and the anti-abortion industry are, if not exactly dancing together, certainly at the same disco.

Something shifted in Gunter. Her work started to expand beyond the hospital walls \u2013 she\u2019d see ripples relating to women\u2019s health in the tabloid press, in presidential debate. Celebrity trends would leak into the anxieties of her patients, her own personal life became political. In 2003, pregnant with triplets, her waters broke far too early. The next day she delivered her 1lb baby alone in a hospital bathroom. He lived for three minutes. After later giving birth to two sons with severe health complications, she quit obstetrics. The experiences traumatised and awakened her. One of her sons has cerebral palsy. \u201cAt some point, someone will discover the science behind it, and we\u2019ll see if we can fix it. The operations my sons had when they were babies were a lesson that there\u2019s just some things in medicine they don\u2019t have answers for yet.\u201d Or, as she realised: \u201cThere are no miracles, there\u2019s just undiscovered science.\u201d Which is one of the reasons she understands the impact of sites like Goop. As a doctor she knew that scrolling for cures was a waste of time, but as a parent she wanted to believe in magic. \u201cThese sites offer you that emotional connection that doctors often jumped. And I think that\u2019s a big fault of medicine. When I trained, we were taught that you don\u2019t talk about yourself with patients, you keep a stiff upper lip. But part of my success comes from people wanting their doctor to be a human. They want their doctor to be authentic. They want to know their doctor cares for them.\u201d Her authenticity arrives like this, in bloody stories of personal trauma, used in tandem with her expertise to bolster arguments about science, but also in more unexpected places. For instance, in The Vagina Bible (a book whose ads were blocked on Twitter because its algorithm flags \u201cvulgar, obscene or distasteful\u201d words) her advice on pubic hair removal is based around the detail that she rarely has a clean razor and she refers, cuttingly, to an ex who told her that her vagina smelled. Facts are important to her \u2013 crystals are bullshit, you should not put glitter in your vagina, razors get blunt. But facts aren\u2019t enough and Gunter\u2019s skill is in her rawness, her frankness about her own experiences and the way she takes celebrity trends apart like oranges, spitting out pips. \u201cWhen I realised that people were believing Goop\u2019s fairy tales, I thought: \u2018I\u2019ll take them on.\u2019\u201d The first anti-Goop post she wrote, on vaginal steaming, centred around the idea that women have long been believed to be unclean. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the core beliefs of the patriarchy. That women are dirty inside. And yet Goop presents this as female empowerment? In Hippocrates\u2019s time they used to think that the womb wandered the body, causing mayhem, and you would coax it back into place by putting fragrant herbs between the legs. This is the same thing. It\u2019s in so many cultures, this belief that the uterus is toxic. I couldn\u2019t believe it was now being presented as female empowerment. It\u2019s bad feminism. And it\u2019s bad science.\u201d Last year, she went to the Goop summit. \u201cUnder my real name, of course. I mean, my whole thing is like, \u2018the truth\u2019, right?\u201d She chuckles darkly. \u201cThere were three talks on how death isn\u2019t real. Apparently when you die, you can use love in your brain to bring you back from the dead. Did you know that? One of the speakers said love cured her cancer, but neglected to tell everybody she\u2019d also had chemotherapy. She said she got cancer because she was \u2018afraid of getting cancer\u2019. That was a very common theme, that fear is the cause of the illness, and that love is the cure.\u201d In a New York Times column, Gunter showed that cancer patients who seek out alternative remedies are more likely to die sooner, because relying on, say, \u201clove\u201d, means they delay medical treatment. \u201cApart from anything, it\u2019s so insulting to anybody who\u2019s ever had an illness, right, that you somehow created it yourself?\u201d Her small bursts of fury are thrilling. She bangs her glass. At the Goop summit, a medium came into the audience where Gunter was sitting, and called out questions. \u201c\u2018Has anyone in the room thought about buying a handbag?\u2019 I mean, we\u2019re in a room full of rich women. \u2018Does anyone like shoes?\u2019 And they were eating it up. They were eating it up.\u201d Later, musing on Goop\u2019s love of mediums on her blog, she wondered: \u201cHow do ghosts have so much health information anyway? Are they all doctors?\u201d She was stunned, and yes, angry. \u201cPaltrow is able to call up any magazine in the world and get on the cover. And this is what she\u2019s doing with her privilege. Grifting off desperate women.\u201d Why does she think Paltrow does it? She pauses, thoughtful. \u201cSometimes people need to explain their success in a way that makes them feel better about themselves? Goop goes back to the fact that women have been destabilised by constantly being told they need to improve, along with the idea that they can have it all.\u201d Which now includes living forever and all the babies you want, and no pain, ever. \u201cIt\u2019s also about recognising the fact that the patriarchy has told them their emotions aren\u2019t valid. Like: you shouldn\u2019t cry when you\u2019re mad. I think Goop telling women that fear causes illness, that your emotions control you, preys on the societal belief that it\u2019s wrong to show emotion.\u201d Would she like to sit down with Paltrow one day, have a conversation about, say, weaponising women\u2019s fears about femininity? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever get an answer that would be satisfying. People have had to spend money, just to prove her breast cancer bra thing was false, money that could have been used to study something important. Many of the medical experts she publishes are part of the anti-vaccine world and post a lot of conspiracy theories. So, either it\u2019s a grift, or she\u2019s a true believer. As a \u2018feminist businesswoman\u2019 she\u2019s claimed the right to \u2018try out\u2019 being a reporter, and then, \u2018try out\u2019 being a doctor. It doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d Gunter smiles thinly. \u201cBut, you know, she\u2019s not the first.\u201d She leans back and tells a story about a man called John Brinkley. Born in 1885, he took his \u201cmedicine show\u201d to rural towns, hawking a sex tonic. He bought a diploma in \u201ceclectic medicine\u201d and set up a business injecting coloured water into the veins of men concerned about their virility. After skipping town on a sea of debt, he opened a clinic where he transplanted goat testicles into people who were \u201csexually weak\u201d. \u201cHe was marketing to people with \u2018adrenal fatigue\u2019 \u2013 familiar, right? He made a lot of money very quickly, so bought off politicians and then bought the local radio station, so he controlled the media. It\u2019s not so different to what a celebrity will do today. The victims died as true believers.\u201d She shrugs. Has anything changed? \u201cI think more people are starting to ask questions. More people are starting to think, \u2018Who should I consider as an expert on a subject?\u2019 And, \u2018What does this person have to gain by giving me information?\u2019 I do think this has always been a constant in society. The difference is, we\u2019re becoming more aware of it now. And I think we\u2019re close to breaking through.\u201d She is veering away from Goop, partly because she\u2019s concentrating on things she sees as more important, like keeping abortion legal (\u201cPulling fetal skulls out of abdomens after clandestine abortions isn\u2019t something I want to do again\u201d) and partly because, ouch, \u201cit feels like punching down.\u201d Now Gunter wants to spend her time helping women understand their bodies, bringing down the patriarchy, and finishing her lunch. In no particular order. Myths and medicine: an exclusive extract from the Vagina Bible Parsley in the vagina The sprig. Stuffed up the vagina each night for three to four nights to induce a period. Look, I don\u2019t make this stuff up, I just report on it. Apparently some people \u2014 people who are wrong \u2013 think it could stimulate uterine contractions. There is no evidence vaginal application of parsley can do that, but even if it could that would not make you have a period. Progesterone withdrawal causes a period, not uterine contractions. Jade eggs for your \u2018yoni\u2019 The idea is that you put an egg-shaped jade rock in your vagina and it puts you in tune with your feminine energy or something. Jade eggs were promoted as an ancient secret of Chinese concubines and queens. I researched this and published my data in a peer-reviewed medical journal \u2013 they are not. The only thing ancient about it is the absence of science. Birth-control pills cause weight gain This has been well studied, and the answer is no. This is not disbelieving women; this is the exact opposite. This is taking what women report about weight gain and studying it. This data really reflects doctors listening to women. Several studies have shown no link between birth-control pills and weight gain. The life situation associated with starting new contraception may be associated with weight gain, but the pill is not. Hormonal contraception causes \u2018infertility\u2019 Nope, but the patriarchy trying to scare you away from controlling reproductive health is invested in this myth. Sadly, many \u2018natural\u2019 health proponents capitalise on this fear as well. With the injection, there can be a delay of several months of return to fertility, but by one year all women are back to baseline. With all other methods of contraception, once stopped or removed, you are good to go pregnancy-wise the next month. Fancy water The latest is so-called \u2018alkaline water\u2019. Water has a pH of 7, and alkaline water has been modified so the pH is 8 or 9. This is an extension of the so-called alkaline diet, which has been promoted to \u2018neutralise the acid in your body\u2019 (medical gibberish) to treat just about everything, even as a treatment for cancer. IT\u2019S NOT. Why all caps? Because people have followed the alkaline diet for cancer and died. The man who wrote the book that helped popularise the alkaline trend was arrested for practising medicine without a licence and sentenced to three years and eight months in jail. This is a grift of epic proportions. Magnets next to your vagina for hot flushes Sometimes I worry I am going to sprain my neck with my eye rolls writing about these and the \u2018science\u2019 *cough, cough* behind them. Yogurt for yeast infections It doesn\u2019t contain the strains of lactobacilli that are important for vaginal health. When a woman puts yogurt in her vagina, she is putting other bacteria there and the consequences are unknown. It may feel soothing because it is cream-like, but the risks are unknown and it will be ineffective. Coffee enemas Dear God, no. People, even some doctors, promote this to treat depression! I. Just. Can\u2019t. Even. Medically speaking, to believe coffee in your rectum could treat anything is ludicrous. I mean, why doesn\u2019t drinking it have the same effect? It is a rabbit hole of epic proportions. Steaming the vagina This is promoted to \u2018cleanse\u2019 the uterus. This ties into a destructive myth that the uterus is unclean or that a period is cleaning the uterus. The idea of a toxin-filled uterus is literally used by many cultures to exclude women from society \u2013 it\u2019s a defining characteristic of the patriarchy. So telling women this exists is promoting a patriarchal idea. Final thoughts Power and health are linked. You can\u2019t be an empowered patient and get the health outcomes you want with inaccurate information and half-truths. I\u2019ve been attacked for coming out against the misinformation and disinformation that are presented to women as worthy of consideration. True choice \u2013 weighing your personal risk-benefit ratio and making a decision for your body based on that information \u2013 requires facts. And it is this quest to give women facts that keeps me up at night. It is why I keep fighting. The patriarchy and snake oil have had a good run, but I\u2019m done with how they negatively affect and weaponise women\u2019s health. So I am not going to stop swinging my bat until everyone has the tools to be an empowered patient and those who seek to subjugate women by keeping them from facts about their bodies have shut up and taken a seat in the back of class. That\u2019s my vagenda. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2019 to clarify an aspect of abortion law in the US.

Nathan Cleary surpassing Mick Gordon\u2019s record individual points tally in one game for a Panther, notching 34. At one stage one of the great all-time NRL marks looked under threat - Dave Brown\u2019s 45 points for Easts in 1935 - but even the Knights couldn\u2019t capitulate that badly.</p> <p>For all that it was too little, too late for the Panthers who finish as first loser in 9th on the table, as earlier Paul Gallen\u2019s first career drop-goal ensured, well, helped, Cronulla secure the final top-eight spot, at the expense of Robbie Farah\u2019s Wests Tigers.</p> <p>In the Super Netball the Sydney Swifts completed their metamorphosis from ugly cygnets to beautiful swans, qualifying for their first ever final. The imposing form of Noeline Taurua\u2019s Sunshine Coast Lightning looms there though, as they look to make it three straight championships.</p> <p>Huge news overnight from the US Open with the shock upset of Serena Williams by teenage Canadian Bianca Andreescu (and there will of course be the matter of another tennis game later tonight - so stick around for that).</p> <p>We\u2019ll also have day five of the Fourth Ashes Test from Old Trafford coming up shortly - where my comrade-in-arms the ever-versatile JP Howcroft will be back at the controls there.</p> <p>Thanks for your company, once again.

And it sees them finish an agonizing <em>one</em> point outside the NRL finals.

      "bodyText": "So the NRL regular season finishes amid a tumbling of records. Nathan Cleary surpassing Mick Gordon\u2019s record individual points tally in one game for a Panther, notching 34. At one stage one of the great all-time NRL marks looked under threat - Dave Brown\u2019s 45 points for Easts in 1935 - but even the Knights couldn\u2019t capitulate that badly. For all that it was too little, too late for the Panthers who finish as first loser in 9th on the table, as earlier Paul Gallen\u2019s first career drop-goal ensured, well, helped, Cronulla secure the final top-eight spot, at the expense of Robbie Farah\u2019s Wests Tigers. In the Super Netball the Sydney Swifts completed their metamorphosis from ugly cygnets to beautiful swans, qualifying for their first ever final. The imposing form of Noeline Taurua\u2019s Sunshine Coast Lightning looms there though, as they look to make it three straight championships. Huge news overnight from the US Open with the shock upset of Serena Williams by teenage Canadian Bianca Andreescu (and there will of course be the matter of another tennis game later tonight - so stick around for that). We\u2019ll also have day five of the Fourth Ashes Test from Old Trafford coming up shortly - where my comrade-in-arms the ever-versatile JP Howcroft will be back at the controls there. Thanks for your company, once again. And that\u2019s Sportwatch! Goodbye James Maloney, good night Newcastle Knights, and hello - the new era at the Panthers, heralded in some style by the Nathan Cleary show. They only scored above 30 points once all season - they\u2019ve saved their best til last, Penrith. And it sees them finish an agonizing one point outside the NRL finals. The son Nathan might be buzzing just now, the father Ivan must surely be ruing that fact. Still, a high note for Panthers fans to go home on. For Knights fans a bitter taste that will last until next March you\u2019d imagine. 76 min: And with their full complement restored after the sin-bin the Knights have thankfully brought a bit of belated steel back to this contest - almost going in themselves, but for some desperate try-line defence from the Panthers. A close up of a Newcastle fan in the crowd - oh my. That\u2019s a thousand-yard-stare with the gentle tinklings of Simon &amp; Garfunkel if ever you\u2019ve seen one. And they\u2019ve gone past the Cowboys and the Titans for season-long points now, Penrith. 400+ points brought up. What attacking issues! Remarkable to think though. Up until this bloodbath they\u2019d scored less points than a team that finishes the NRL season with just four wins. Yikes. NRL - Try! Penrith 54-10 Newcastle (Cleary) 66 min: They\u2019re already on the bus home, the Knights. But how about this kid! And to think he\u2019s still only 21-years-old. No wonder they signed him on a 57 year contract. What a future. He\u2019s scored a fourth try, he\u2019s converted a ninth goal - it\u2019s an incredible 34-point-haul for Cleary, and don\u2019t bet for a second that he\u2019s finished there. NRL - Try! Penrith 48-10 Newcastle (Burns) 65 min: Stop. The. Fight. This is Monty Python\u2019s Knight out there, taking flesh wound after flesh wound. They\u2019re being torn to shreds, Newcastle. Commiserations for any travelling fans who made the journey down the freeway. Cleary: 8/8. NRL - Try! Penrith 42-10 Newcastle (Cleary) 64 min: There\u2019s a drought across western New South Wales but it is beginning to absolutely rain in Western Sydney. And who else - it\u2019s Cleary with his second career hat-trick of tries! He kicks the conversion - 7/7. They are coming home HARD, Penrith. A bit more on all of that: I was meant to go to the bathroom and do a bunch of other miscellaneous tasks during the HT break, but I spent the 10-15 minutes break trying to crunch some stats for you (the perils of an idle mind). Trying to get my head round how Panthers can look reasonably good across the park but then score so few points (only Bulldogs have scored less this season) and musing on the absence of \u201cfinishers\u201d. In the list of top tryscorers across the whole NRL the first Panther enters the list in 33rd position (Brent Naden, with Brian To\u2019o the only other player to enter the top 50). All 15 other teams have one (or in some cases four) players above that. Is it a question of technique? Speed? Combinations? NRL - Try! Penrith 36-10 Newcastle (Leota) 59 min: This could get nasty for the Knights - the home fans are loving this. But surely they\u2019re scratching their heads and wondering, where was this when they needed it earlier in the season? It\u2019s only the second time all season the Panthers have put on 30+ points. And to think they\u2019ve beaten the Roosters, the Rabbits - plenty of other decent scalps along the way. They really should be playing finals footy, Penrith. And after all that talk about Penrith struggling to find points in the NRL in 2019, they\u2019ve suddenly turned into razzle-dazzlers! There will be more to come now, no doubt - as Connor Watson is sent to the bin for slowing they play. Professional foul, goodbye! NRL - Try! Penrith 30-10 Newcastle (Egan) 52 min: And now it\u2019s Burns\u2019 housemate Wayde Egan who crashes over - but that was unbelievable work in the lead up by Willy Kikau! How has he stayed in field?! That was Lomu-esque! Great strength, great determination and he keeps the ball alive to find his hooker back inside. And just for a change, Cleary plugs another from the sideline. NRL - Try! Penrith 24-10 Newcastle (Burns) 50 min: It\u2019s the kid Billy Burns who grabs the bounce-back try for the Panthers, and he\u2019s buzzing the boy from Parkes! It\u2019s his first in the NRL. No mistake from Cleary who makes it 4/4. Let\u2019s hope Bernard Foley\u2019s watching. NRL - Try! Penrith 18-10 Newcastle (Ese\u2019ese) 45 min: And they do make it count! It\u2019s the bustling interchanger Herman Ese\u2019ese (so good they named him twice) who gets over the line. Poor old Jimmy Maloney is spitting chips - he reckons it was a soft pen in the lead up, and replays suggest big question marks over a possible double movement. Anywho, game on! NRL - second half! We\u2019re back! And it\u2019s the Knights starting with two penalties in quick succession - can they turn it into early scoreboard pressure? Was their a mini rev up inside the Newcastle sheds? An interesting saying from Paul Gallen post-match from Cronulla\u2019s impressive win (see earlier) - apparently an old adage, but I for one had certainly never heard it. He said: the game was won early, even if the points came late - which was a pretty fair reflection of that from Penrith. Strong defence from the home side over the first 20, and suddenly they were into the sheds with three tries under the belt. Sport really is a psychological ol\u2019 contest. NRL - half-time: Penrith 18-4 Newcastle And there ends the first forty! I wanted to say it\u2019s been all Penrith, but remarkably it was the Knights with 54% of the pill. Some early repeat sets perhaps helping up that statistic, because certainly in terms of territory it was a half played predominantly just outside Newcastle\u2019s line. The margin a fair reflection, but for home fans they\u2019ll be wondering where this clinical edge has suddenly come from. NRL - Try! Penrith 18-4 Newcastle (Cleary) 37 min: Ooh, he\u2019s in a mood today! Cleary with just a second-ever career double, and again it comes from the halfback with his head up taking on the line. Quality work. More of this in 2020 from him, you\u2019d hope. And flawless again from the boot. Cleary 14-4 Knights. 34 min: It may be the end of the season for both these sides but what a chance to run the rule over Generation Next. Former Knights legend Danny Buderus gives an update on the talent coming through Newcastle\u2019s stable - it may have been a long six-years without finals footy for the faithful, but perhaps 2020 just could be one to get excited about for Novocastrians.. Try - Penrith 12-4 Newcastle (To\u2019o) 30 min: And apologies to anyone sweating on as-live-as-possible updates, I\u2019ve just realised I was about four minutes behind on my Kayo. (Old dogs, new tricks etc). It\u2019s still Penrith on the front foot here, A great bust from Kikau gets the Panthers close, but desperate defence from Ponga keeps them out. But from seemingly nowhere, it\u2019s To\u2019o who takes it all upon himself! He\u2019s jinked in from the outside - beats one, beats two, beats three, four, five - six! Remarkable run! Cleary adds the extras. Magic stuff, Panthers. NRL - try! Penrith 6-4 Newcastle (Cleary) 26 min: I was just maligning the lack of runners getting on the end of good work from Nathan Cleary - he obviously thinks the same so he\u2019s gone and done it all himself! And he\u2019s kicked the conversion himself. That all started from a clever short restart which they regathered to put the Knights straight back on the back foot. A great response to going behind! NRL - try! Penrith 0-4 Newcastle (Toa) 22 min: The highs and lows of professional footy! Minutes earlier the kid Starford Toa would have wanted the earth to open up and swallow him as he knocked-on on his own line. He\u2019s more than made amends with a clever intercept out wide and it\u2019s a 90m gallop to score his first NRL try in the corner! The conversion attempt looks good - but it fades into the post! And another one you may have missed - hell of a howler this from the overnight European football qualifiers: Here\u2019s the vid of the players responding to the mystery anthem. Amazing reactions of pure mystification (apologies to Albanian fans for reliving this colossal %^&amp;* up): 15 min: They\u2019re knocking at the door, the Panthers, but as they have all season, having done the hard work they just can\u2019t broach (breach?) the Knights\u2019 try-line. What was that stat - worst cumulative try-scoring tally in 20+ years? Hard to believe with Maloney and Cleary in the halves, but doubt there will be a big off-season examination into where it\u2019s gone wrong for Penrith. 10 min: It\u2019s backs-to-the-wall stuff early on for the Panthers who endure repeat sets, but they\u2019re handed a big boost here as debutant winger Starford Toa comes unstuck under a swirling Cleary bomb. He\u2019s spilled that, 5m outside his own line, as it bounces desperately off the youngster\u2019s chest. Can they make this count, Penrith? And for our northern hemisphere audience (or late night workers down under who have just emerged from hermetically sealed environments) - hasn\u2019t there been a result at Flushing Meadows in the US Open women\u2019s final. The imperious Kevin Mitchell is your humble scribe: History almost weighed both of them down, but it was Andreescu, younger by nearly 19 years \u2013 the biggest age gap in a slam final in the Open era \u2013 who held steady. It was the grand dame of tennis who cracked, despite launching a brave and desperate fightback in the second set. 4 min: Oh wow. They were across the line, but they couldn\u2019t ground it, the Panthers! The fullback Edwards came flying through to swoop on a Cleary grubber but he\u2019s been taken out in a flying try-saver.. by the goal post! Absolutely collected, and the ball spills free! You don\u2019t see that too often. NRL - Panthers v Knights - kickoff! We\u2019re away out in Sydney\u2019s West from Panthers Stadium and it\u2019s the irrepressible David Klemmer who takes the first hit up for the Knights. Look for James \u201cJimmy\u201d Maloney to play with a wry smile on his face - it\u2019s goodbye to another star of the game, let\u2019s see if the Panthers can send him out a winner. If you missed the result from earlier this afternoon it was another inspiring performance from the Swifts\u2019 sharpshooter Sam Wallace, as the one-time cellar-dwellers of the Super Netball book themselves a grand final berth. Terrific result for the club: The NRL doesn\u2019t stop there however - if you thought that was the key fixture of the weekend, look again. It\u2019s Knights v Panthers in the \u201coh, what could have been\u201d derby. Both sides sitting a tantalising two points away from finals footy irrespective of a win today, but no doubt keen to give their fans one last cheer to salve a close but no cigar season. Footy, eh? From the childlike joy of Paul Gallen (if that\u2019s a sentence you can write, let alone a concept you can get around) to the disappointment of Robbie Farah. Two colossi of the game, marking the end of their (regular season) careers in hugely divergent fashion - the latter saying goodbye to Leichhardt with pain etched all across his face. They\u2019ve not done it again, the Tigers. There will be no William Blake on the 433 bus back to Sydney CBD this evening. Happier times for the folk from the Shire (I hope they\u2019re well staffed at Engadine Maccas) and the people\u2019s prince, PM Scott Morrison, who will travel home in better spirits. A finals showdown with Manly awaits them next week and the season stays alive! Ok, that\u2019s all from me for now, Richard Parkin is your man to chaperone you through to the end of the day. The day began with the Tigers and Sharks in a sudden death finals eliminator. Seconds from half-time they still could not be separated. Ten minutes later and a three-try burst from Cronulla obliterated Wests and paved the way for a trip to Manly in the first week of the playoffs. NRL: 79 mins: Tigers 8-25 Sharks - Ha ha ha ha ha! Cronulla taking the p*** at Leichhardt Oval. With the Sharks\u2019s final possession of the game Paul Gallen drops a goal from in front of the posts. That is very very cruel indeed. NRL: 75 mins: Tigers 8-24 Sharks - The Tigers have pushed and pushed but the Sharks are still in command of their own destiny. NRL: 62 mins: Tigers 8-24 Sharks - Brilliant from Luke Garner, can it spark a Tigers comeback? They\u2019ll need Momirovski to kick better if they\u2019re to stand any chance. That was an awful conversion miss. NRL: 55 mins: Tigers 4-24 Sharks - Robbie Farah is on for his final appearance as a Tiger at Leichhardt Oval. It\u2019s going to take a miracle from the veteran to rescue Wests from here. NRL: 52 mins: Tigers 4-24 Sharks - What is happening out there!? Three tries in no time at all and the Sharks are blowing the Tigers out of the water. NRL: 49 mins: Tigers 4-18 Sharks - It was four-all in the shadows of half-time but now the Sharks are storming their way into the finals. Two tries in the blink of an eye since the break and now the Tigers have an uphill battle to keep their season alive. NRL: 46 mins: Tigers 4-12 Sharks - Who will make it into the finals? It\u2019s looking like Cronulla after Josh Morris\u2019s early second-half try. NRL: 45 mins: Tigers 4-6 Sharks - The second period is underway at Leichhardt Oval. Who will make it into the finals? The Swifts took this preliminary final by the scruff of the neck in the opening half and despite the best efforts of a desperate Vixens fightback that early lead always proved too much. As well as NSW performed Melbourne only have themselves to blame for a series of early shooting mishaps, then their failure to capitalise throughout the match when momentum was turning in their favour. As predicted pregame Paige Hadley and Karen Moloney dominated the Nissan Net Points, the former named player of the match by Cath Cox. The Swifts now travel to Brisbane for the 2019 Super Netball grand final against the Sunshine Coast Lightning. That\u2019s next Sunday at 1pm. NRL: HT: Tigers 4-6 Sharks - Just two points separating these sides after a low scoring half at Leichhardt Oval. Surely, surely, this pair can\u2019t engineer at draw and eliminate the Broncos, can they? This would rival West Germany v Austria in 1982! Super Netball: Q4: 5 mins remaining: Swifts 54-44 Vixens - Panic over Swifts fans. NSW have resisted all the Vixens can hurl at them and now they can look ahead to a grand final showdown. Super Netball: Q4: 8 mins remaining: Swifts 49-42 Vixens - Huge play by the Swifts, the ball went through hands for an age before Wallace finally put it away. The Vixens\u2019s defence was impressive but the industry of Hadley and Housby eventually found the opening. It\u2019s going to be hard for the Vixens to close the gap with so little time left. Super Netball: Q4: 11 mins remaining: Swifts 46-41 Vixens - The margin is down to five! The Swifts have lost all fluency around the circle and the visitors are chasing hard. But for the umpteenth time today Melbourne cannot really make NSW pay, fluffing their lines with a turnover goal on the cards. Super Netball: Q4: 12 mins remaining: Swifts 46-40 Vixens - The Vixens are still chasing... Super Netball: 3QT: Swifts 44-37 Vixens - The Vixens made up four points on the Swifts in that third quarter and threatened to bust the game wide open but they still trail by seven points at the final break. Total shots are now pretty much even but the Swifts are converting at 94%, the Vixens just 80%. NRL: 20 mins: Tigers 2-4 Sharks - The TMO works in Cronulla\u2019s favour this time, Briton Nikora crossing for the opening try of the match following good work from Shaun Johnson. Not so good from the Kiwi seconds later though after his straightforward conversion struck the upright. Super Netball: Q3: 4 mins remaining: Swifts 40-35 Vixens - Oh boy! The Vixens have finally strung some goals together (seven of the last eight!) and the momentum is all their way. Their ball movement is suddenly rapid and mistakes are creeping into the Swifts\u2019s game. This is getting nervy. Super Netball: Q3: 7 mins remaining: Swifts 39-31 Vixens - The Vixens are not giving up but the Swifts have stabilised in this third quarter. As has been the case throughout the match Melbourne have fashioned half-chances but been unable to finish the job only to find NSW ready to punish them as soon as they regain possession. NRL: 13 mins: Tigers 2-0 Sharks - The TMO rules No Try to the Sharks after Mulitalo almost capitalised on a chip and chase. Super Netball: Q3: 11 mins remaining: Swifts 36-28 Vixens - Time out called by the Swifts to settle this contest down after the Vixens burst out of the blocks after half-time. The margin is still eight points in the home side\u2019s favour and Housby is still causing havoc around the circle, but the Swifts have been instructed to match the intensity of their visitors in the huddle. Super Netball: Q3: 13 mins remaining: Swifts 33-25 Vixens - The opening three goals in the third quarter all to the Vixens... could the comeback be on? NRL: 7 mins: Tigers 2-0 Sharks - Not much to report early on but the Tigers have an early lead after being gifted a penalty under the posts. That was followed up by Dugan belting the restart miles over the dead ball line to hand the Tigers good field position. NRL: Tigers 0-0 Sharks - Underway at Leichhardt Oval in one of the moments of the NRL season. The beloved old ground has never looked better, packed to the rafters and bathed in sunshine, ready for a do-or-die contest between NSW rivals. The winner makes the finals, the loser can plan for 2020. If that wasn\u2019t enough there\u2019s the late late selection drama with fan favourite Robbie Farah added to the 17 at the very last minute, the veteran leading his team out for the final time on home turf after replacing Corey Thompson after the prematch warm-up. Super Netball: HT: Swifts 33-22 Vixens - The Swifts have now won nine out of ten quarters against the Vixens this season and they are cruising towards a grand final date with the Lightning. The Vixens started the quarter impressively but a series of mistakes saw them fail to capitalise on their ascendancy and by the half-time siren they looked all out of momentum. NRL: Drama at Leichhardt Oval! Robbie Farah will play after all after Corey Thompson injured himself in the warm-up. What a contest this is going to be. Super Netball: Q2: 6 mins remaining: Swifts 28-17 Vixens - That early burst from the Vixens has fizzled out and the Swifts are back in control. Melbourne\u2019s inability to craft an attack is letting them down possession after possession with Hail Mary passes going astray and chances around the circle going begging. Hadley is dominating the Nissan Net Points while Kumwenda has impressed for the Vixens since her introduction. Super Netball: Q2: 9 mins remaining: Swifts 23-16 Vixens - Copy and paste. The Vixens are right back in this as a contest but time and again the passing chain comes unstuck around the circle. The margin should be much closer and the momentum should be all with the visitors but the Swifts maintain their handy lead. Super Netball: Q2: 12 mins remaining: Swifts 22-14 Vixens - The Vixens have come out with greater intensity this quarter, forcing a midcourt turnover, but again they fail to punish the Swifts and the margin remains intimidating. Super Netball: QT: Swifts 19-12 Vixens - How bad was that opening quarter for the Vixens? Thwaites has already been replaced by Kumwenda with the visitors shooting at just 67%, while Mannix has also been dragged from the other circle. They\u2019re behind on intercepts (3-0), rebounds (3-0), and penalties (21-8). Is this one over already? Super Netball: Q1: 5 mins remaining: Swifts 15-7 Vixens - The Swifts are flying, the crowd is rocking, and the Vixens are stunned. Haythornthwaite is increasingly influential for the home side, feeding Samatha Wallace with ease. Super Netball: Q1: 8 mins remaining: Swifts 9-4 Vixens - Liz Ellis singled out Paige Hadley and Kate Moloney beforehand and they were both central to a pivotal passage of play that ended with the Swifts securing a five goal lead. First Moloney played a defence splitting pass that Thwaites was unable to finish before Hadley picked off a loose pass out of defence to feed Wallace and force the visitors into a time out. Super Netball: Q1: 10 mins remaining: Swifts 6-3 Vixens - It\u2019s all the Swifts in these early exchanges with Helen Housby to the fore, finding space in the Vixens defence. Super Netball: Q1: 12 mins remaining: Swifts 3-0 Vixens - A nervy start from both teams with handling errors and turnovers aplenty but the Swifts look to be settling the quickest. Can the Vixens get a foothold? Super Netball: We\u2019re underway in the preliminary final! Super Netball: Liz Ellis has singled out the match-up between Paige Hadley and Kate Moloney in the midcourt as the crucial battle in today\u2019s contest. Moloney was outstanding last week when she was named player of the match against the Magpies, her intensity sparking a dynamic performance from the Vixens. Hadley was MVP when the Swifts won all four quarters in Melbourne back in round five. NRL: The final team lists are in for the blockbuster between the Tigers and Sharks and there\u2019s no place in the Wests 17 for Robbie Farah. Super Netball: The two sides are out on court warming up at a packed Quaycentre. Remember the Swifts have won this match-up twice already this season, and both with room to spare. However, the Vixens are bringing in plenty of momentum after a superb showing in their derby against the Magpies last week. Hello everybody and welcome to another finals-focussed Sunday Sportwatch. Today\u2019s action begins in Super Netball with the Swifts hosting the Vixens for the right to travel to the Lightning in next week\u2019s grand final. That one gets underway shortly after 1pm. Then our attention turns to a very tasty finals decider in the NRL with the Tigers and Sharks facing off in an eliminator to see who makes the top eight. We\u2019re underway at Leichhardt Oval around 2pm. There\u2019s more NRL action later on with the Panthers and Knights from 4pm. Around that we have the Ashes to discuss, a changing of the guard in women\u2019s tennis at Flushing Meadows, the weekend\u2019s AFL finals action, and the continued excellence of the Australian women\u2019s cricket team - who are back in action tonight from 11.30pm in the West Indies.

Part of my love of the spite house is the way it questions what a house is for. As has been proven elsewhere by the erection of glass and steel buildings intended to be used as oligarchs\u2019 safety deposit boxes rather than homes, the myth that a house is built simply for people to sleep and eat and bathe in has long been debunked. Instead they are objects of war and anxiety, two-up, two-down, too much.</p> <p>In Rachel Cusk\u2019s new collection of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/05/2019-in-books-a-literary-calendar\" title=\"\">essays</a>, she writes about the effect it had on her to redecorate her house. Looking around her newly painted home, she felt a \u201ccertain sense of shame\u201d at having caused walls to be knocked down and floors to be ripped up and rooms to be gutted, at causing the past to be obliterated. She saw a hidden part of herself exposed \u2013 the private decisions she\u2019d made were exhibited for all to see. The domestic, she explains (and I imagine her writing this at a desk so exquisite it hovers half an inch above the ground) is more concerned with seeming than with being \u2013 personal ideas are externalised and failings made real.</p> <p>A fan of Cusk\u2019s bracing work, I spent a happy afternoon poring over pictures of her current home on an estate agent\u2019s website that I frequent, being also a fan of existential pain. A divine and brutal <a href=\"https://www.themodernhouse.com/journal/rachel-cusk-house-norfolk/\" title=\"\">mansion</a> on the Norfolk coast where she lives with her third husband, it is elevated further by Cusk\u2019s musings on property.</p> <p>\u201cPeople always buy the house,\u201d she says in captions accompanying the photos, \u201cfor the stage of life they\u2019ve just passed through. When something\u2019s completed it\u2019s often the moment that you suddenly understand what it is you\u2019ve wanted and needed.\u201d</p> <p>In the <em>New York Times</em> that same day I was introduced to the 1990s architecture of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/t-magazine/reversible-destiny-arakawa-madeline-gins.html\" title=\"\">Madeline Gins and Shusaku Arakawa</a>, who designed homes to allow their inhabitants eternal life. Their method was this: make them deeply uncomfortable. A brightly painted bathroom has no door, but it does have two toilets, plumbed back to back.</p> <p>Spite is a perfectly valid reason to build a house. Five years ago psychologists started studying spite and, using game theory, found that when it was used to punish other spiteful players (a person building the narrowest house in the country, perhaps, in the back-alley their neighbour coveted) the overall outcome was a decline in spiteful exchanges, leading to new stability. Plus, it feels good. In Romanian folklore a genie tells a peasant he can have anything he wants, but his neighbour will get twice as much. The peasant says, firmly: \u201cPut out one of my eyes.\u201d I picture the owner of the emoji house chuckling similarly over a pumpkin spice latte, calm in the knowledge that homes have become abstracted to the point of metaphor, that houses are machines for sulking in. And her rental glows pinkly in the corner of her sightline, providing constant reassurance that she is not the only person that suffers. </p> <p><em>Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

As has been proven elsewhere by the erection of glass and steel buildings intended to be used as oligarchs\u2019 safety deposit boxes rather than homes, the myth that a house is built simply for people to sleep and eat and bathe in has long been debunked. Instead they are objects of war and anxiety, two-up, two-down, too much. In Rachel Cusk\u2019s new collection of essays, she writes about the effect it had on her to redecorate her house. Looking around her newly painted home, she felt a \u201ccertain sense of shame\u201d at having caused walls to be knocked down and floors to be ripped up and rooms to be gutted, at causing the past to be obliterated. She saw a hidden part of herself exposed \u2013 the private decisions she\u2019d made were exhibited for all to see. The domestic, she explains (and I imagine her writing this at a desk so exquisite it hovers half an inch above the ground) is more concerned with seeming than with being \u2013 personal ideas are externalised and failings made real. A fan of Cusk\u2019s bracing work, I spent a happy afternoon poring over pictures of her current home on an estate agent\u2019s website that I frequent, being also a fan of existential pain. A divine and brutal mansion on the Norfolk coast where she lives with her third husband, it is elevated further by Cusk\u2019s musings on property. \u201cPeople always buy the house,\u201d she says in captions accompanying the photos, \u201cfor the stage of life they\u2019ve just passed through. When something\u2019s completed it\u2019s often the moment that you suddenly understand what it is you\u2019ve wanted and needed.\u201d In the New York Times that same day I was introduced to the 1990s architecture of Madeline Gins and Shusaku Arakawa, who designed homes to allow their inhabitants eternal life. Their method was this: make them deeply uncomfortable. A brightly painted bathroom has no door, but it does have two toilets, plumbed back to back. Spite is a perfectly valid reason to build a house. Five years ago psychologists started studying spite and, using game theory, found that when it was used to punish other spiteful players (a person building the narrowest house in the country, perhaps, in the back-alley their neighbour coveted) the overall outcome was a decline in spiteful exchanges, leading to new stability. Plus, it feels good. In Romanian folklore a genie tells a peasant he can have anything he wants, but his neighbour will get twice as much. The peasant says, firmly: \u201cPut out one of my eyes.\u201d I picture the owner of the emoji house chuckling similarly over a pumpkin spice latte, calm in the knowledge that homes have become abstracted to the point of metaphor, that houses are machines for sulking in. And her rental glows pinkly in the corner of her sightline, providing constant reassurance that she is not the only person that suffers.

She is upfront in her introduction about the obvious self-absorption of the personal essay \u2013 \u201cwriting is either a way to shed my self-delusions or a way to develop them\u201d \u2013 and if her arguments lack the elegant certainties of a writer such as Solnit, the frankness with which she expresses self-doubt and confusion seems an apt reflection of the cultural currents she sets out to investigate. Personal experience figures prominently in the pieces here, from her teenage experience on an early reality TV show, to growing up in an evangelical megachurch that was \u201cso big we called it the Repentagon\u201d. Elsewhere, she considers the social and cultural pressures on young women in Always Be Optimizing, a whistlestop drive through the vast subject of feminism and the beauty myth, in the light of her obsession with barre class. \u201cWe were lucky, I thought, dissociating, to even be able to indulge these awful priorities, to have the economic capital to be able to accrue more social capital via our looks.\u201d If the essay holds up the absurdity of desiring this commodification of ourselves while acknowledging the awfulness of it, without offering answers, this is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the book: the act of inquiry is worthwhile in itself, if only in ensuring that we are not sleepwalking. Regardless, Tolentino offers a sharp eye that cuts through the multiple distorted reflections thrown back at women by the culture that surrounds us. Rachel Cusk has always written fearlessly about personal experience as a way of considering the expectations on women, from the inequalities of motherhood to the destruction and reinvention that comes with divorce, and has often faced considerable backlash from other women for her frankness, so a new collection of her nonfiction is always to be eagerly anticipated. The first section, which contains the title essay, gathers a series of reflections on a particular stage of mid-life. Making Home and Lions on Leashes consider the reconfiguring of identity that comes with the point at which teenage children outgrow their home, and what the idea of \u201chome\u201d means as a woman and a writer. Cusk is rarely political in the explicit sense, but On Rudeness begins with an observation of immigration officers at an airport in the aftermath of the 2016 EU referendum and expands to examine the role of language and expression in the social divisions made visible by the vote. Cusk\u2019s unsparing ability to see links between her own experience and broader literary and historical perspectives has always elevated her personal writing above mere memoir, and this collection cements her reputation as one of the most fierce and elegant chroniclers of how we live now. \u2022 Whose Story Is This: Old Conflicts, New Chapters by Rebecca Solnit is published by Granta (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<p><strong>David Tennant </strong>is being lined up to play the murdered Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in a TV drama. Following Litvinenko\u2019s poisoning in London in 2006, the case has since proved popular for adaptation and retelling. A play, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/04/lucy-prebble-interview-litvinenko-very-expensive-poison-old-vic-enron-succession\" title=\"\">A Very Expensive Poison</a></em>, about his assassination has just opened at the Old Vic, itself loosely based on the book of the same name by <em>Guardian</em> journalist Luke Harding. Now ITV has a script from George Kay, who penned two episodes of <em>Killing Eve</em>, and whose 12-part drama, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAZac21Y9D8\" title=\"\">Criminal</a></em>, premieres on Netflix later this month.</p> <p>Tennant, a former Doctor Who, a cop from <em>Broadchurch</em>, and now a lead in <em>Criminal</em>, is favoured as Litvinenko. The TV series is itself based on Channel 4\u2019s 2017 documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/hunting-the-kgb-killers\" title=\"\">Hunting the KGB Killers</a></em>, whose producer, Richard Kerbaj, is behind the ITV series, along with drama veteran Patrick Spence.</p> <p><strong>Orazio Gentileschi\u2019s </strong><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/orazio-gentileschi-the-finding-of-moses\" title=\"\">The Finding of Moses</a> </em>has hung in the National Gallery since 2002.

      "bodyText": "David Tennant is being lined up to play the murdered Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in a TV drama. Following Litvinenko\u2019s poisoning in London in 2006, the case has since proved popular for adaptation and retelling. A play, A Very Expensive Poison, about his assassination has just opened at the Old Vic, itself loosely based on the book of the same name by Guardian journalist Luke Harding. Now ITV has a script from George Kay, who penned two episodes of Killing Eve, and whose 12-part drama, Criminal, premieres on Netflix later this month. Tennant, a former Doctor Who, a cop from Broadchurch, and now a lead in Criminal, is favoured as Litvinenko. The TV series is itself based on Channel 4\u2019s 2017 documentary Hunting the KGB Killers, whose producer, Richard Kerbaj, is behind the ITV series, along with drama veteran Patrick Spence. Orazio Gentileschi\u2019s The Finding of Moses has hung in the National Gallery since 2002. Graham Kirkham, who made his fortune with the furniture firm DFS, is believed to have owned the baroque masterpiece for two decades, and he is now selling it.

The nature of the tragedy that played out last August in north London seemed almost unprecedented in modern Britain. The desperation that drives someone to self-immolation is more familiar from foreign news reports: the protests of Tibetan monks in China, of demonstrators against Soviet tanks during the Prague spring, or the Tunisian fruit seller whose suicide sparked the Arab spring. Several people have threatened to set themselves on fire in British welfare offices in the past decade: one man is reported to have badly burned his legs. But the tragedy in Barnet House, the concrete high-rise where the council housing offices were based until recently, appears to be the only death on record. An Observer investigation has uncovered the pressures that were building in the months before Smith\u2019s devastating decision, and how safety nets that could have protected her in a double crisis of housing and mental health failed at the most critical moment. There is no way to untangle the web of factors that contributed to Smith\u2019s despair. But austerity policies have been linked to tens of thousands of extra deaths and a rise in suicides, studies have found, although most are private tragedies, not public protests. \u201cIt\u2019s the level of desperation that I find frightening,\u201d said Barry Rawlings, a Labour councillor in Barnet, of Smith\u2019s death. \u201cIt\u2019s an individual tragedy but it\u2019s also an indication of harm in our society.

A security guard rapidly extinguished the flames and Smith, who was in her fifties, was airlifted to hospital, but she died after several months in intensive care. Despite the extremity of the protest, once she was carried away in the air ambulance, she all but vanished from the public eye. The council ordered its employees in Barnet House not to talk about the incident to journalists, sources claimed. Police confirmed only that there had been an incident and the local paper noted simply that a woman had been taken to hospital with burn injuries. Smith\u2019s housing crisis began when an eviction notice arrived through the post in April 2018, warning that her landlord had started legal proceedings to remove her from her home. She had rent arrears of more than \u00a3700, which her mother said were a result of the bedroom tax. In theory, she could have moved to a smaller home, but across London there are severe shortages of social housing. Councils have moved tens of thousands of families out of their areas and many out of the city entirely, government figures show. Residents in Barnet said they had been left with no option but to move as far away as Leicester. Smith was not offered an alternative home by the council, her mother said, and knew her chance of finding one in Barnet was extremely low. But her life was rooted in the area.

The doctor certified Smith as healthy, however, and when she tried to speak to someone from the practice, she was turned away by the receptionist, she told her mother. The local clinical commissioning group said it was unable to comment on individual cases. Depression was given as a partial cause of her death, along with burn injuries. \u201cI feel she was let down in such a cruel way really,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cShe said things were getting on top of her and she was finding it difficult to cope. But it was beyond anything you would expect to happen in life.

Judges handing down eviction orders ask for proof that landlords have made genuine efforts to find a negotiated solution. So a housing association would normally send several letters and make home visits to a renter who faces losing their home.

His rule became defined by bloody, murderous excesses that claimed thousands of lives and were largely ignored by the west; by political repression and a tanking economy. Today Zimbabwe is a failed state because it has no capability of providing services to its people. The government-controlled power company can only provide six hours of electricity a day. Hospitals have been turned into death traps; there is no medication for the poorest of the poor. The country can\u2019t even provide passports for those who want to leave \u2013 the home affairs ministry can only produce 80 a day, where 8,000 should be normal. There is no fuel due to an acute shortage of foreign exchange caused by corruption and lack of investment. Long queues are a daily reality. The unemployment rate hovers around 90-95%, with many Zimbabweans who are educated to degree level selling newspapers and cigarettes at street corners. Inflation stands at around 550% a year and most food is beyond the reach of the poor. Teachers earn an equivalent of \u00a323 a month and doctors are paid \u00a387. Back in the day, Zimbabwe and Nigeria were the only two countries in sub-Saharan Africa that had television; today Zimbabwe is the only country of significance without commercial television. The list of Zimbabwe\u2019s brokenness is long, and it is a list that defines Mugabe\u2019s legacy and violent reign. He will not be mourned by millions of Zimbabweans who still suffer the consequences of his incompetent and corrupt rule.

Having come to power by fighting against the previous regime, with spells in prison or exile, charismatic leaders can only sustain their power as that charisma fades by progressively tightening control.

Inevitably, the economy suffers: there is a lack of investment, growing shortages, government rationing and rampant inflation.

      "bodyText": "If democracies have learned anything, it is that one man or woman in control of a country for decades never works. Having come to power by fighting against the previous regime, with spells in prison or exile, charismatic leaders can only sustain their power as that charisma fades by progressively tightening control. Challengers, typically embodying some combination of fresh ideas, new social forces and a desire to end abuse, are held down by ever fouler means. Even if the state purports to be a democracy, elections are rigged, the media muzzled and opposition politicians harried or even killed. Inevitably, the economy suffers: there is a lack of investment, growing shortages, government rationing and rampant inflation. As the despot gets older, there is a fight for the succession, but without rules, process or accountability, so that it becomes a raw and destructive battle between factions. The need for orderly succession is an overlooked and powerful argument for democracy, as those conniving in the strutting power of presidents Putin and Xi will one day discover.

      "body": "<p>Flesh rolls, stretch marks and dimpled thighs aren\u2019t a traditional mainstay of New York fashion week, nor are lingerie shows ever deemed to have a finger on the pulse. But if the hype around Rihanna\u2019s new collection is anything to go by, the industry is bracing itself for a wobble.</p> <p>This Tuesday the star, named the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/05/rihanna-named-worlds-richest-female-musician\" title=\"\">world\u2019s richest female musician</a> by Forbes, will be mounting her second Savage X Fenty show at an as-yet-to-be-disclosed Brooklyn venue. As per her debut last year, which was celebrated as a game-changing \u201cfestival of flesh of all skin tones\u201d by <em>Vogue</em>, the spectacle is expected to be diverse, inclusive and attended by fashion and celebrity A-listers.</p> <p>Last year Rihanna staged a direct assault on the traditionally hard-bodied, Barbie-doll aesthetic entrenched in the multibillion-dollar underwear industry by including plus size and pregnant models on her catwalk.</p> <p>This year she is making no bones about occupying the space created by the fast-declining but still dominant Victoria\u2019s Secret. Rihanna\u2019s event will be streamed on 20 September by Amazon Prime, and is expected to be aggressively marketed to its app users and customer base, propelling the viewership and sales far beyond the reach of any other show.</p> <p>After a 20-year tenure and posting its worst ever viewing figures last year, Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s annual show won\u2019t be broadcast on television at all this year.</p> <p>The brand best known for its frou-frou polyester knicker sets and fairy wings has been battered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/02/victorias-secret-female-friendly-shtick-pleasing-men-lingerie\" title=\"\">its association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who falsely posed as a model scout for the company. Epstein used his close friendship with Leslie Wexner, then head of the retailer\u2019s parent company L Brands, to facilitate his alleged crimes against young girls. But mainly Victoria\u2019s Secret has suffered for failing to adapt to social and consumer change, unable to influence the cultural zeitgeist in a way it once did.</p> <p>While the company still generated sales of $7.4bn (\u00a36bn) in 2018, its market share dropped from 33% to 24% in just two years. The chain has struggled to resonate with younger buyers, who appear to be choosing comfort over seduction, and will close 53 stores in the US alone this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2f18ee6134dde1fa048fb702ee3712550fc17df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2f18ee6134dde1fa048fb702ee3712550fc17df/706_152_1799_1079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Savage X Fenty fall/winter 2018 show at New York fashion week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Savage X Fenty fall/winter 2018 show at New York fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JP Yim/Getty Images for Savage X Fenty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rihanna\u2019s vision for Savage X Fenty, which launched with more than 90 styles of bras, knickers, bodysuits, rompers and robes, has been designed by her for women like her \u2013 who, as she put it, might be \u201ca curvy girl with thighs and a little bit of booty and hips\u201d. The brand is speaking directly to a contemporary audience hungry for a less narrow and prescriptive representation of sexiness.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Victoria\u2019s Secret has not hidden its debt to male fantasies. As noted by the <em>Atlantic</em>, its former president, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/victorias-secret-epstein/595507/\" title=\"\">Howard Gross, boasted</a> of \u201cnever conducting any research into what actual women wanted from their underwear or their lives\u201d. The company itself was founded in 1977 by a man named Roy Raymond who \u201cimagined it as a haven for straight men, something more titillating than the mainstream department-store offerings but less salacious and fringe than sex shops\u201d. The advertising campaigns and lingerie sets that followed were dreamed up from men\u2019s sexual fantasies, rather than making any claim of \u201cempowering\u201d women through garters and bralets.</p> <p>Rihanna, who has sold 60 million albums and 215 million digital tracks, making her the biggest-selling digital artist of all time, has been lauded for her business prowess. She pivoted from pop music to cosmetics with Fenty Beauty in 2017. The range was met with hysteria: when it was launched in the UK exclusively at Harvey Nichols, queues formed around the block.</p> <p>Savage X Fenty, which announced a $50m round of new funding from backers last week, followed in 2018 and has cemented the 31-year-old\u2019s reputation for immense savvy. Both brands have been actively designed, led and curated by Rihanna, whose authenticity and \u201cBadGalRiRi\u201d image remains a key part of her appeal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c2c0e985987dfa54f3b8fbea160a5859a1e5efd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c2c0e985987dfa54f3b8fbea160a5859a1e5efd/0_184_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models wear items from the range.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models wear items from the range.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Savage X Fenty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWomen should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves,\u201d she said when the brand launched. \u201cI can only hope to encourage confidence and strength by showing lingerie in another light. You don\u2019t have to stick to one personality \u2026 I want people to wear Savage X Fenty and think: \u2018I\u2019m a bad bitch\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Casting relatable women in beauty and lingerie campaigns, and offering products that cater to all body shapes and skin tones, and at affordable prices, may seem obvious, but it remains a groundbreaking model for the industry.</p> <p>According to Lou Stoppard, former editor of the fashion site SHOWStudio, Rihanna\u2019s success lies in serving consumers ignored by the mainstream: \u201cNot content with merely shaking up a beauty market that seemed committed to ignoring non-white women, she\u2019s Fenty-fying our underwear drawers. [Rihanna has] spotted the gap in the market for underwear that doesn\u2019t equate female excellence with a penchant for goji berries and 5am starts to get to the gym\u201d.</p>",

This Tuesday the star, named the world\u2019s richest female musician by Forbes, will be mounting her second Savage X Fenty show at an as-yet-to-be-disclosed Brooklyn venue. As per her debut last year, which was celebrated as a game-changing \u201cfestival of flesh of all skin tones\u201d by Vogue, the spectacle is expected to be diverse, inclusive and attended by fashion and celebrity A-listers. Last year Rihanna staged a direct assault on the traditionally hard-bodied, Barbie-doll aesthetic entrenched in the multibillion-dollar underwear industry by including plus size and pregnant models on her catwalk. This year she is making no bones about occupying the space created by the fast-declining but still dominant Victoria\u2019s Secret. Rihanna\u2019s event will be streamed on 20 September by Amazon Prime, and is expected to be aggressively marketed to its app users and customer base, propelling the viewership and sales far beyond the reach of any other show. After a 20-year tenure and posting its worst ever viewing figures last year, Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s annual show won\u2019t be broadcast on television at all this year. The brand best known for its frou-frou polyester knicker sets and fairy wings has been battered by its association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who falsely posed as a model scout for the company. Epstein used his close friendship with Leslie Wexner, then head of the retailer\u2019s parent company L Brands, to facilitate his alleged crimes against young girls. But mainly Victoria\u2019s Secret has suffered for failing to adapt to social and consumer change, unable to influence the cultural zeitgeist in a way it once did. While the company still generated sales of $7.4bn (\u00a36bn) in 2018, its market share dropped from 33% to 24% in just two years. The chain has struggled to resonate with younger buyers, who appear to be choosing comfort over seduction, and will close 53 stores in the US alone this year. Rihanna\u2019s vision for Savage X Fenty, which launched with more than 90 styles of bras, knickers, bodysuits, rompers and robes, has been designed by her for women like her \u2013 who, as she put it, might be \u201ca curvy girl with thighs and a little bit of booty and hips\u201d. The brand is speaking directly to a contemporary audience hungry for a less narrow and prescriptive representation of sexiness. Meanwhile, Victoria\u2019s Secret has not hidden its debt to male fantasies. As noted by the Atlantic, its former president, Howard Gross, boasted of \u201cnever conducting any research into what actual women wanted from their underwear or their lives\u201d. The company itself was founded in 1977 by a man named Roy Raymond who \u201cimagined it as a haven for straight men, something more titillating than the mainstream department-store offerings but less salacious and fringe than sex shops\u201d. The advertising campaigns and lingerie sets that followed were dreamed up from men\u2019s sexual fantasies, rather than making any claim of \u201cempowering\u201d women through garters and bralets. Rihanna, who has sold 60 million albums and 215 million digital tracks, making her the biggest-selling digital artist of all time, has been lauded for her business prowess. She pivoted from pop music to cosmetics with Fenty Beauty in 2017. The range was met with hysteria: when it was launched in the UK exclusively at Harvey Nichols, queues formed around the block. Savage X Fenty, which announced a $50m round of new funding from backers last week, followed in 2018 and has cemented the 31-year-old\u2019s reputation for immense savvy. Both brands have been actively designed, led and curated by Rihanna, whose authenticity and \u201cBadGalRiRi\u201d image remains a key part of her appeal. \u201cWomen should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves,\u201d she said when the brand launched. \u201cI can only hope to encourage confidence and strength by showing lingerie in another light. You don\u2019t have to stick to one personality \u2026 I want people to wear Savage X Fenty and think: \u2018I\u2019m a bad bitch\u2019.\u201d Casting relatable women in beauty and lingerie campaigns, and offering products that cater to all body shapes and skin tones, and at affordable prices, may seem obvious, but it remains a groundbreaking model for the industry. According to Lou Stoppard, former editor of the fashion site SHOWStudio, Rihanna\u2019s success lies in serving consumers ignored by the mainstream: \u201cNot content with merely shaking up a beauty market that seemed committed to ignoring non-white women, she\u2019s Fenty-fying our underwear drawers. [Rihanna has] spotted the gap in the market for underwear that doesn\u2019t equate female excellence with a penchant for goji berries and 5am starts to get to the gym\u201d.",

Along with other Tory MPs, including Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, and Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer and Hilary Benn, they had spent their summer holidays drawing up a bill they believed would force Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Brexit if he could not strike a new deal with the EU by mid-October.</p> <p>Johnson had insisted before and since becoming prime minister that he would never ask the EU for another postponement and would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d, \u201cdo or die\u201d.

As they chatted before the meeting, they were confident they had both the numbers to get the bill on the statute book and the time to do so before parliament was closed.</p> <p>Outside in Whitehall, and down the road in Parliament Square, a constant din of protest and counter-protest rang out from Remainers and Leavers alike. It was parliament\u2019s first day back after the long July and August recess \u2013 and the controversial prorogation announcement. Police had separated people on different sides of the Brexit divide as best they could but still arguments broke out between them on the pavement. Remainers chanted \u201cstop the coup\u201d while Leavers carried banners saying \u201cTraitor Parliament\u201d and \u201cBoris. No Deal is Ideal\u201d. Opposite the entrance to the Commons one of the protesters, Dr John Dinnen, said he had woken up at 2am so worried about what Brexit would mean for peace on the island of Ireland, where he was born, that he had decided to get a train from Hereford to protest about a possible no deal. \u201cI feel very strongly about it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When the No 10 meeting got under way, the former Tory ministers \u2013 members of the so-called Gaukeward Squad \u2013 asked Johnson what proposals he had to break the deadlock with Brussels and secure a new agreement to stop the UK crashing out in less than two months\u2019 time. If he really had such a plan, and it proved acceptable to the EU and parliament, they made clear that their efforts to force him to go to Brussels to ask for another delay would be unnecessary and everyone would be happy.</p> <p>\u201cHe had a folder on the desk with him and pointed at it, suggesting the plans were inside,\u201d said one source at the meeting. The MPs then inquired whether the folder\u2019s contents had been presented to EU leaders. \u201cHis response was that the EU would only really begin negotiating in earnest when it was sure the UK was serious about no deal,\u201d said another source. \u201cAnd the PM was clear the EU was not yet sure that we were serious about no deal so nothing had been sent to them yet.\u201d</p> <p>The message Johnson wanted to convey was that the MPs\u2019 attempts to block no deal were taking the heat off Brussels. During an hour of discussions, Clark asked for some specific details on particular issues and Johnson said someone from his office would get back to him. Later that day, Clark received a phone call from Johnson\u2019s closest aide, Dominic Cummings, which failed to provide answers. Instead Clark found himself on the end of a foul-mouthed tirade.</p> <p>According to sources aware of the exchange, Cummings bawled at him, saying: \u201cWhen are you MPs going to realise that we are leaving on 31 October?\u201d before adding: \u201cWe are going to fucking purge you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3de660a566082c8e991130a347486a99a36b2de2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3de660a566082c8e991130a347486a99a36b2de2/549_215_2951_1770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaks in the House of Commonson Tuesday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking in the House of Commons for the first time on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just a few hours after the meeting, Johnson made his first speech in the chamber as prime minister. Reporting on the G7 summit in Biarritz, he struck a different tone about the Brexit talks. \u201cIt is simply not true to say we are not making progress,\u201d he said. \u201cI returned from the G7 with real momentum in the Brexit discussions.\u201d This ran contrary not only to the impression he had given to rebel MPs earlier, but also to a report that day in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> which had quoted Cummings as having admitted in a private meeting that negotiations with the EU were \u201ca sham\u201d.</p> <p>As Johnson spoke, the Tory MP Phillip Lee, a Remainer,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/03/commons-showdown-looms-in-battle-over-no-deal-brexit-live?page=with:block-5d6e9e7e8f082da28762cb25\" title=\"\"> crossed the floor of the house to join the Liberal Democrats on the opposition benches</a>. In an instant Johnson had lost his majority; his ability to govern was draining away. Lee and the rebels could see that the Prime Minister was putting out one set of messages in private and another in public. \u201cThe only conclusion to be drawn was that he was actually planning for No Deal,\u201d said one of the rebels. Lee wrote in his resignation letter that Brexit had transformed the Conservative party into a \u201cnarrow faction\u201d that had \u201cincreasingly become infected with the twin diseases of populism and English nationalism\u201d.</p> <p>Later, during a debate that evening on the rebel plan to take control of parliamentary business, the leader of the Commons, Jacob-Rees Mogg, reclined on the government frontbench.

The government had lost by 328 to 301 votes.

All rebel MPs, including the father of the house, Kenneth Clarke, and Sir Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, had the whip withdrawn, and were told they would not be allowed to stand as Conservatives at the next election. The veteran Tory MP Roger Gale said Johnson was \u201cin danger of tearing the party apart\u201d and rumours spread that cabinet ministers, including Amber Rudd, were seething and considering how long they could remain in the government.</p> <p>It was clear by the evening that part one of the Johnson/Cummings masterplan - to use prorogation coupled with threats - had not only failed spectacularly but had backfired. One of those who were purged, the former foreign office minister Alistair Burt says: \u201cI have never seen a government strategy so misjudged, nor fail so speedily, as that devised in Downing Street since late July.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/boris-johnson-tory-rebels-trust-brexit-deal\">All trust is gone ... and the PM only has one way out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The treatment of grandees such as Clarke and Soames had upset Tory MPs of all Brexit persuasions, even some of the most committed Leavers, such as Sir Edward Leigh, who voiced his disquiet at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers. The rebels said the behaviour of No 10 was swelling their numbers, not reducing them so had been utterly counter-productive as well as deeply divisive.</p> <p>On the Tory benches on Wednesday \u2013 a day No 10 had set aside for Sajid Javid\u2019s spending review, with its many promises to increase funding of public services \u2013 purged MPs rose one after another to decry the gradual disintegration of a once-tolerant and internationalist Conservative party.</p> <p>There was defiance and dark humour.

Barring problems in the Lords it was heading on to the statute book.</p> <p>On only the second day of parliamentary business under Johnson\u2019s premiership he had suffered two defeats and lost his majority. Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP at Westminster, observed that \u201cthis must be the shortest-lived honeymoon in parliamentary history\u201d.</p> <p>Incredibly, some Conservatives went further, predicting that Johnson was cornered and could be finished as PM. He had promised never to extend the Brexit deadline but had failed to stop a new law being passed that was about to force him to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t like to say this, and I hardly dare, but I think it could be checkmate,\u201d said one of the leading Tory rebels.</p> <p>He was right to be cautious. Johnson, Cummings, and No 10\u2019s head of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa, might not have succeeded yet, but they had another scheme up their sleeves which they believed would still scupper the rebel plans.</p> <p>At 7.51pm on Wednesday, Johnson rose in the Commons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/boris-johnson-suffers-commons-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-him\" title=\"\">to move a motion</a> \u201cthat there shall be an early general election\u201d on 15 October. If parliament were to vote in favour in sufficient numbers, and the Tories were to win the election with a big enough majority, Johnson could then repeal the Benn bill and avoid having to ask for an extension. The pressure, it seemed, was on the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Johnson told MPs it would be unthinkable for the Labour party leader to refuse a chance to go to the country. \u201cHe has demanded an election for two years while blocking Brexit. He said only two days ago that he would support an election...is he now going to say the public cannot be allowed an election to decide which of us sorts out this mess?\u201d Labour and the other opposition parties, including the SNP, had, however, agreed their lines. They would back a general election \u2013 but not on Johnson\u2019s terms and not on 15 October.</p> <p>Instead they would vote against the motion and say an election should be called when the Benn bill had received royal assent or, better still, when Johnson had actually asked the EU for an extension. Corbyn responded to the election call with mockery. \u201cThe offer of the election today is a bit like the offer of an apple to Snow White from the Wicked Queen, because what the Prime Minister is offering is not an apple or even an election, but the poison of no deal.\u201d</p> <p>To force an election, Johnson needed a two-thirds majority of all MPs to back him. But Labour MPs abstained en masse. The result when it came at 9.21pm was 298 in favour and 56 against. The election ploy had failed, Johnson had lost again, and everyone wondered what on earth he could do next. In the early hours of the next day \u2013 Thursday \u2013 exhausted peers who were opposed to the Benn bill<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/05/thursday-briefing-peers-shut-down-tory-filibuster-of-bill-to-stop-no-deal\" title=\"\"> gave up their attempts at filibustering </a>in the House of Lords and the last hurdle in the way of the Benn bill had been cleared. It is expected to gain royal assent early this week.</p> <p>The headlines in the Tory-supporting papers tore into Corbyn. The <em>Daily Mail</em> declared: \u201cCorbyn chickens out of an election\u201d. But it was the prime minister who was in far deeper trouble. And things were to get worse. Shortly after 11pm, the prime minister\u2019s brother Jo, a Remainer, resigned from the cabinet, saying he had been \u201ctorn between family loyalty and the national interest\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b1e856cf79d7cdbf4c762c65ef7610e9553841f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1e856cf79d7cdbf4c762c65ef7610e9553841f2/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson speaking in West Yorkshire on Thursday; he was criticised for using police cadets for political purposes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson speaking in West Yorkshire on Thursday; he was criticised for using police cadets for political purposes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a visit to Morley, in West Yorkshire, the prime minister was harangued in front of TV cameras by residents, with one accusing him of \u201cplaying games\u201d when he \u201cshould be in Brussels negotiating\u201d, and another telling him: \u201cPlease leave my town\u201d. On the same trip north he gave speech in Wakefield, with rows of police cadets lined up behind, declaring that he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership. The decision to use police cadets for political purposes was widely criticised as senior Tories, including some in the Cabinet, called for a change of strategy. At a dinner that night, the former Conservative prime minister John Major called on Johnson to \u201cget rid\u201d of Cummings and reinstate the MPs he had suspended, without whom \u201cwe will cease to be a broad-based national party, and be seen as a mean-minded sect\u201d.</p> <p>This weekend, Johnson and his advisers suffered another blow: Amber Rudd quit as work and pensions secretary and resigned the Tory whip. She cited the same concerns that Gauke\u2019s rebels had raised, that she no longer believed Johnson wanted to get a deal with the EU. His decision to withdraw the whip from the 21 rebels was \u201can assault on decency and democracy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59a600783d0a298e899d6de7fecc998c51dcdda4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59a600783d0a298e899d6de7fecc998c51dcdda4/509_0_978_1222/800.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd resigned as work and pensions secretary and quit the Tory whip on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They are desperate to find ways to trigger a general election in which they can attack Labour and the other opposition parties for blocking the \u201cwill of the people\u201d.

But doing neither would mean Johnson being in contempt of court and having to quit, say lawyers.</p> <p>There are suggestions that he will try on Monday to call a vote of no confidence in his own government in an attempt to force a general election, and ask Tory MPs to back that motion. But would the speaker, John Bercow, allow such a move that was clearly aimed at achieving a purpose other than that stated in the motion itself?

      "bodyText": "At 11am last Tuesday a group of senior Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit gathered outside the cabinet room at No 10 for a meeting with the prime minister. The former chancellor Philip Hammond, the ex-justice secretary David Gauke and the former business secretary Greg Clark were among them. Along with other Tory MPs, including Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, and Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer and Hilary Benn, they had spent their summer holidays drawing up a bill they believed would force Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Brexit if he could not strike a new deal with the EU by mid-October. Johnson had insisted before and since becoming prime minister that he would never ask the EU for another postponement and would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d, \u201cdo or die\u201d. To limit the amount of parliamentary time the rebels would have to pass the bill, the prime minister had already announced he would shut parliament down for five weeks from next week ahead of a new Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October. But the cross-party alliance opposed to no deal had moved fast in response, and accelerated their plans. As they chatted before the meeting, they were confident they had both the numbers to get the bill on the statute book and the time to do so before parliament was closed.

Shortly after 11pm, the prime minister\u2019s brother Jo, a Remainer, resigned from the cabinet, saying he had been \u201ctorn between family loyalty and the national interest\u201d. On a visit to Morley, in West Yorkshire, the prime minister was harangued in front of TV cameras by residents, with one accusing him of \u201cplaying games\u201d when he \u201cshould be in Brussels negotiating\u201d, and another telling him: \u201cPlease leave my town\u201d. On the same trip north he gave speech in Wakefield, with rows of police cadets lined up behind, declaring that he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership. The decision to use police cadets for political purposes was widely criticised as senior Tories, including some in the Cabinet, called for a change of strategy. At a dinner that night, the former Conservative prime minister John Major called on Johnson to \u201cget rid\u201d of Cummings and reinstate the MPs he had suspended, without whom \u201cwe will cease to be a broad-based national party, and be seen as a mean-minded sect\u201d. This weekend, Johnson and his advisers suffered another blow: Amber Rudd quit as work and pensions secretary and resigned the Tory whip. She cited the same concerns that Gauke\u2019s rebels had raised, that she no longer believed Johnson wanted to get a deal with the EU. His decision to withdraw the whip from the 21 rebels was \u201can assault on decency and democracy\u201d. They are desperate to find ways to trigger a general election in which they can attack Labour and the other opposition parties for blocking the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. Polls this weekend, including the latest Opinium survey for the Observer, showing a 10-point lead for the Conservatives, will encourage them to hang on and fight. No 10 insists that the prime minister will neither resign nor ask for an extension to Brexit. But doing neither would mean Johnson being in contempt of court and having to quit, say lawyers. There are suggestions that he will try on Monday to call a vote of no confidence in his own government in an attempt to force a general election, and ask Tory MPs to back that motion. But would the speaker, John Bercow, allow such a move that was clearly aimed at achieving a purpose other than that stated in the motion itself? Another idea floated by sources close to Johnson yesterday was that he would try to force the EU to expel the UK by refusing to nominate a commissioner, a ploy Downing Street seems to think would bring the EU to its knees \u2013 but which Brussels insists would not work. After a week of such drama culminating in Rudd\u2019s resignation, MPs have no idea what will unfold next. \u201cWe just have to wait and see what the latest genius plans are from No 10,\u201d said a senior Labour figure. \u201cIf they are as disastrous as those they tried over the last few days, I don\u2019t see how he can survive. \u201cBut what do I know? What does anyone know?\u201d",

Sadly, he received a similarly swift introduction to some of the worst elements of Italian football culture.

Moise Kean was subjected to the same chants when Juventus visited Cagliari in April, just as Blaise Matuidi had been the previous year and Sulley Muntari in 2017.</p> <p>Nor are they exclusive to one club. Inter were ordered to play two games behind closed doors last season after Kalidou Koulibaly was racially abused during their win over Napoli.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it was striking to see the defence of Cagliari\u2019s supporters being led by ultras from the very club whose new signing had been targeted. Lukaku is a popular addition at Inter. The same Facebook group that aspired to teach him what constitutes racism had previously shared a picture of him stood with some of <a href=\" https://www.facebook.com/377678756165410/photos/a.379751342624818/446218435978108/?type=\" 3&amp;theater\"\" title=\"\">its members, wearing a Curva Nord T-shirt</a>.</p> <p>Solidarity between ultras, however, has often transcended club loyalties. Following the abuse of Koulibaly, Napoli distributed photographs of his face at their next home game. Thousands were held up before kick-off but the ultras behind each goal declined to participate \u2013 standing instead to commemorate Daniele Belardinelli, a Varese fan who had died after being run over following an attack on a minibus full of Napoli\u2019s own supporters on their way to the Inter game.</p> <p>This season, there have been tributes in various Italian stadiums to Fabrizio Piscitelli, widely known by his nickname, Diabolik. Piscitelli had been the leader of the Irriducibili, the group of Lazio ultras who long stood at the centre of the Stadio Olimpico\u2019s Curva Nord, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/10/death-of-diabolik-fabrizio-piscitelli-lazio-football-ultra\" title=\"\">before being shot dead in August.</a></p> <p>Under Piscitelli\u2019s leadership, the Irriducibili used violence to claim superiority over rival Lazio ultras in the late 1980s and became notorious for fascist imagery and antisemitic provocations.</p> <p>Even as their influence waned in recent years, the group still attracted attention by leaving stickers of Anne Frank wearing a Roma shirt on the walls of the Stadio Olimpico, and attempting to <a href=\"https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/lazio-ultras-flyer-in-curva-nord-forbids-women-in-first-ten-rows-28055\" title=\"\">ban women from the front 10 rows of the curva</a>.</p> <p>At Inter\u2019s opening home game of this season, against Lecce, ultras staged a giant choreography in Piscitelli\u2019s honour, the words \u201cFabrizio with us\u201d accompanied by two Lazio eagles spread across the second tier of San Siro\u2019s curva nord.</p> <p>Even Antonio Conte\u2019s first game as manager \u2013 also Lukaku\u2019s debut \u2013 marking the death of an admired rival was given precedence over their own team.</p> <p>Such a response may help to explain their treatment of Lukaku. In their open letter to the player, the Inter ultras sought to portray themselves as the persecuted party. \u201cWhen you declare that racism is a problem to be fought in Italy,\u201d they wrote, \u201cyou just help the repression against all football fans, including us.\u201d</p> <p>It is a narrative that ties together with far-right politics: the suggestion that free speech is under attack from an authoritarian establishment. Ultras are quick to highlight perceived inconsistencies as well.

      "bodyText": "Romelu Lukaku has adapted quickly to life in Serie A, scoring in his first two games for Internazionale. Sadly, he received a similarly swift introduction to some of the worst elements of Italian football culture. Targeted with monkey chants during the win at Cagliari, he was then addressed with an open letter from a group of his own club\u2019s ultras insisting he ought not to interpret such abuse as racist. \u201cYou have to understand that Italy is not like many other north European countries where racism is a REAL problem,\u201d said the statement, published on Facebook by a group who occupy the second tier of the Curva Nord at Inter\u2019s San Siro home. \u201cIn Italy we use some \u2018ways\u2019 only to \u2018help our teams\u2019 and to try to make our opponents nervous, not for racism but to mess them up.\u201d It is true the methods are nothing new. Moise Kean was subjected to the same chants when Juventus visited Cagliari in April, just as Blaise Matuidi had been the previous year and Sulley Muntari in 2017. Nor are they exclusive to one club. Inter were ordered to play two games behind closed doors last season after Kalidou Koulibaly was racially abused during their win over Napoli. Nevertheless, it was striking to see the defence of Cagliari\u2019s supporters being led by ultras from the very club whose new signing had been targeted. Lukaku is a popular addition at Inter. The same Facebook group that aspired to teach him what constitutes racism had previously shared a picture of him stood with some of its members, wearing a Curva Nord T-shirt. Solidarity between ultras, however, has often transcended club loyalties. Following the abuse of Koulibaly, Napoli distributed photographs of his face at their next home game. Thousands were held up before kick-off but the ultras behind each goal declined to participate \u2013 standing instead to commemorate Daniele Belardinelli, a Varese fan who had died after being run over following an attack on a minibus full of Napoli\u2019s own supporters on their way to the Inter game. This season, there have been tributes in various Italian stadiums to Fabrizio Piscitelli, widely known by his nickname, Diabolik. Piscitelli had been the leader of the Irriducibili, the group of Lazio ultras who long stood at the centre of the Stadio Olimpico\u2019s Curva Nord, before being shot dead in August. Under Piscitelli\u2019s leadership, the Irriducibili used violence to claim superiority over rival Lazio ultras in the late 1980s and became notorious for fascist imagery and antisemitic provocations. Even as their influence waned in recent years, the group still attracted attention by leaving stickers of Anne Frank wearing a Roma shirt on the walls of the Stadio Olimpico, and attempting to ban women from the front 10 rows of the curva. At Inter\u2019s opening home game of this season, against Lecce, ultras staged a giant choreography in Piscitelli\u2019s honour, the words \u201cFabrizio with us\u201d accompanied by two Lazio eagles spread across the second tier of San Siro\u2019s curva nord. Even Antonio Conte\u2019s first game as manager \u2013 also Lukaku\u2019s debut \u2013 marking the death of an admired rival was given precedence over their own team. Such a response may help to explain their treatment of Lukaku. In their open letter to the player, the Inter ultras sought to portray themselves as the persecuted party. \u201cWhen you declare that racism is a problem to be fought in Italy,\u201d they wrote, \u201cyou just help the repression against all football fans, including us.\u201d It is a narrative that ties together with far-right politics: the suggestion that free speech is under attack from an authoritarian establishment. Ultras are quick to highlight perceived inconsistencies as well. Footage has emerged of Cagliari supporters making similar noises to those directed at Lukaku at a white centre-forward, Brescia\u2019s Alfredo Donnarumma, as he prepared to take a penalty against them. Context matters, in cases of discrimination, and attempts to present the two cases as analogous ought to be resisted. Yet Cagliari officials have cited these events as muddying the waters in their own attempts to identify and ban those who engage in racist abuse. Knowing how to respond to an open letter published on a social media platform is more complicated still. When Koulibaly was abused at San Siro last season, Inter reacted by launching their own anti-racism initiative, Brothers Universally United (an acronym for the noise made by the abusers, \u201cBUU\u201d), but so far neither they nor Lukaku have made any comment on the ultras\u2019 letter. The player may feel he has said all he wanted on the subject with an Instagram post following the Cagliari game, in which he called on football federations and social media platforms to do more to combat discrimination. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, it\u2019s 2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstead of going forward we\u2019re going backwards.\u201d Serie A intends launching a fresh anti-racism initiative next month, to include all 20 clubs with \u201cthe aim of making all supporters more aware of this delicate and important issue\u201d. Awareness, though, can hardly be the problem after a week when the story spread around the world.",

Signed since she was 13, the Leicester singer-songwriter enjoyed early support from Ed Sheeran, putting out a 2016 debut project, <a href=\"https://lnk.to/DiaryOfMe\" title=\"\"><em>Diary of Me</em></a>, whose freshness was hampered by its fence-sitting between guitar balladry and soul. <em>Love and Compromise</em> is technically the 21-year-old\u2019s second album, but is being pushed as her debut proper. It resolves the genre problem, having opted for an eclectic take on British soul-pop. Despite the emotional content here, Mahalia exudes a breezy mellowness, with thoroughly 2019 themes rubbing up against retro stylings.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svTIrOcfYEs\" title=\"\">Do Not Disturb</a> feels like a natural successor to Mahalia\u2019s best-known older track, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sober+mahalia\" title=\"\">Sober</a>. Where Sober was inspired by her tendency to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47854958\" title=\"\">text while tipsy</a>, Do Not Disturb finds her locating her phone\u2019s leave-me-alone function. There other modish inflections here: the trap skitters of What You Did, and the 90s R&amp;B moves of He\u2019s Mine. Mahalia\u2019s distinctive coo and audible Caribbean heritage dovetails naturally with the global moment for dancehall, so that on-trend moments such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxjpzUgZvbo\" title=\"\">Simmer</a> (featuring Nigerian Afrobeats powerhouse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/28/burna-boy-african-giant-review\" title=\"\">Burna Boy</a>) feel organic rather than laboured. Contrary to the default sizzle of both genres, however, Mahalia is telling a love interest to simmer down. Elsewhere, the desire for mutual respect and a suspicion of compromise (voiced by an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlUjHu3H_L4\" title=\"\">Eartha Kitt sample</a>) also echoes loud and clear. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxjpzUgZvbo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GxjpzUgZvbo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxjpzUgZvbo\">Watch the video for Simmer by Mahalia, ft Burna Boy.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Mahalia\u2019s overly anointed status still raises the hackles somewhat. Signed since she was 13, the Leicester singer-songwriter enjoyed early support from Ed Sheeran, putting out a 2016 debut project, Diary of Me, whose freshness was hampered by its fence-sitting between guitar balladry and soul. Love and Compromise is technically the 21-year-old\u2019s second album, but is being pushed as her debut proper. It resolves the genre problem, having opted for an eclectic take on British soul-pop. Despite the emotional content here, Mahalia exudes a breezy mellowness, with thoroughly 2019 themes rubbing up against retro stylings. Do Not Disturb feels like a natural successor to Mahalia\u2019s best-known older track, Sober. Where Sober was inspired by her tendency to text while tipsy, Do Not Disturb finds her locating her phone\u2019s leave-me-alone function. There other modish inflections here: the trap skitters of What You Did, and the 90s R&amp;B moves of He\u2019s Mine. Mahalia\u2019s distinctive coo and audible Caribbean heritage dovetails naturally with the global moment for dancehall, so that on-trend moments such as Simmer (featuring Nigerian Afrobeats powerhouse Burna Boy) feel organic rather than laboured. Contrary to the default sizzle of both genres, however, Mahalia is telling a love interest to simmer down. Elsewhere, the desire for mutual respect and a suspicion of compromise (voiced by an Eartha Kitt sample) also echoes loud and clear.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cHas theatre abandoned the middle class?\u201d wailed a headline in the <em>Telegraph</em> last Tuesday. Well, not this week. Simon Woods\u2019s debut play, boldly programmed in the substantial space of the Lyttelton, is set in the Cotswolds, features a cream-coloured Aga and stars a sparring couple: (white) Tory MP (Eton\u2019n\u2019Oxford) and his (white) left-leaning, non-working wife. The foxes that destroy the garden are accused of being European; this country is accused of having an \u201cinsatiable desire to be fucked by an old Etonian\u201d. It is May 1988.</p> <p>Viewing the present through a 30-year-old lens, <strong><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/hansard\" title=\"\">Hansard</a></strong> is often elegant but rarely urgent. Woods, himself an actor (he was Mr Bingley in the 2005 <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> movie), has come up with springy one-liners and tried to guard against too obvious a distribution of sympathy, not least by giving the MP some shrewd anti-theatre grumbles: too many neurasthenics on stage; not enough people doing jobs. Yet some targets are too predictably lined up, as if the couple were appearing on the <em>Today</em> programme: he sneers at Islington and geography teachers. She snipes at Margaret Thatcher for favouring men.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHas theatre abandoned the middle class?\u201d wailed a headline in the Telegraph last Tuesday. Well, not this week. Simon Woods\u2019s debut play, boldly programmed in the substantial space of the Lyttelton, is set in the Cotswolds, features a cream-coloured Aga and stars a sparring couple: (white) Tory MP (Eton\u2019n\u2019Oxford) and his (white) left-leaning, non-working wife. The foxes that destroy the garden are accused of being European; this country is accused of having an \u201cinsatiable desire to be fucked by an old Etonian\u201d. It is May 1988. Viewing the present through a 30-year-old lens, Hansard is often elegant but rarely urgent. Woods, himself an actor (he was Mr Bingley in the 2005 Pride and Prejudice movie), has come up with springy one-liners and tried to guard against too obvious a distribution of sympathy, not least by giving the MP some shrewd anti-theatre grumbles: too many neurasthenics on stage; not enough people doing jobs. Yet some targets are too predictably lined up, as if the couple were appearing on the Today programme: he sneers at Islington and geography teachers. She snipes at Margaret Thatcher for favouring men. I would still like one day to see a play in which it was the chap who was the lefty and the woman rigidly unemotional. Crucially, a shift in emphasis and feeling comes too abruptly in this 90-minute play. 1988 was the year in which Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government introduced section 28, the law forbidding local authorities to \u201cpromote homosexuality\u201d. An unspoken truth is eventually disclosed and the couple\u2019s bitterness can be seen in a different light. But the revelation comes like a bushfire, not as something that has been simmering. It does, though, show two marvellous actors at their intricate best. Lindsay Duncan has a lethal delicacy. Slipping through the room that Hildegard Bechtler has cleverly designed to look opulent and uncared for, she eviscerates with a sigh or a husky emphasis. Alex Jennings, swinging around with smooth confidence but holding his jaw rigid, crumples like a blown-up paper bag.

      "body": "<p>There are some stories that, though they wait half a lifetime, must get told. Seven years ago, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje gave an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/13/adewale-akinnuoye-agbaje-interview\" title=\"\">interview</a> to this paper in which he talked about his autobiographical film, <em>Farming,</em> which was then about to go into production after a dramatised reading of the script had headlined a Sundance festival promotion in London. At the time the actor was enjoying a measure of Hollywood fame for his role in the cult TV series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/lost\" title=\"\">Lost</a></em>. <em>Farming</em>, which he had then already been writing and developing for nearly a decade, explored a real-life mystery: it was the incredible story of how he, a young Nigerian boy raised by white foster parents in 1970s Tilbury, Essex, had forged an identity for himself in a violently racist local skinhead gang, and lived to tell the tale.</p> <p>The film, which eventually premiered at the <a href=\"https://www.tiff.net/events/farming\" title=\"\">Toronto festival last year</a>, goes on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0uIvUqf_Jo\" title=\"\">wider release this month</a>. It both dramatises a brutal and moving coming-of-age and shines a light on a little-known chapter in the story of race relations in Britain: the practice that led to thousands of Nigerian children like Akinnuoye-Agbaje being \u2018farmed out\u2019 to British families in that period.

My parents would use racist slurs to us, but you would hear the same things on TV comedies; it was the wallpaper of that time. That is not to excuse them. But one of the things I hope the film shows is that their initial intent to take on children was pure \u2013 my mother could not have children of her own \u2013 but over time there was a realisation that it was also a racket, and money could be made out of it.\u201d</p> <p>As he grew older his mother encouraged him to shoplift for her, and just walking down the street was a trial: \u201cYou had dogs set on you, bricks thrown at you.\u201d</p> <p>His father forced him back out on the streets to stand up to the bullies on his own: \u201cThere was no way of getting love. If all you have experienced is humiliation and rejection, and your foster father forces you to fight back or get a beating from him, you look for any kind of lifeline. There were only two options: fight, or become a victim. I tried the victim option for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Akinnuoye-Agbaje\u2019s sense of dislocation was not helped when his birth parents, of whom he was hardly aware, abruptly arrived to take him with them back to Nigeria when he was eight or nine years old. From the streets of Tilbury he was suddenly transported to a traditional village. He was struck mute by the change. The solution his parents arrived at was to send him back to the same family in Essex where he now suffered an even greater identity crisis. In desperation he tried to scrub away at his skin to make it whiter. When that did not work, Akinnuoye-Agbaje adopted the only strategy for survival that seemed available to him. He made himself tougher and more fearless than his tormentors. At 16, expelled from school, he joined forces with them, becoming part of the skinhead gang that had once stripped and beaten him in the street.</p> <p>At first, he says he was treated as a weapon to be unleashed in turf battles with other gangs, or occasionally in racial assaults on black sailors in the docks. \u201cIt was not cosy at any moment.

He laughs when I mention that criticism.</p> <p>\u201cHad those people grown up in Tilbury? London was a so-called multicultural melting pot by the early 1980s. But on the outskirts, it was a very different story. Anybody who has those opinions I invite them to go back to Tilbury and be the only black kid in that school. It\u2019s not that I want to say all skinhead culture was like that, but this particular group certainly was.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the most extreme scenes in the film mix incidents that Akinnuoye-Agbaje heard about as well as experienced first hand. \u201cThe fights I was involved in were not fatal ones. But let\u2019s be clear,\u201d he claims, \u201cseveral of the guys I was with six months later were dead, and they were dead because of hammers to the head or whatever. It was a very real world that I conveyed.\u201d</p> <p>It was his foster mother who rescued him in the first instance. Unsure how to protect him from the gang, she contacted his birth family \u2013 and after one violent confrontation with his father (by now a successful lawyer in Nigeria) he was packed off to boarding school in Surrey. He first rejected that opportunity. Then, with the encouragement of a girlfriend and a teacher, eventually embraced education. He went on to study law at King\u2019s College London.</p> <p>\u201cPeople often ask me: how do you go from being a skinhead to having a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree?\u201d he says. He tells them: \u201cIntelligence is the ability to make the most of your circumstances, whether you are on the street or in a university. The big help was a teacher who helped to translate the language of the law into a vernacular I understood. Once I got that, I was off to the races.\u201d He laughs. \u201cObviously I had an intimate knowledge of breaking the law. My master\u2019s was in criminal justice; I did a thesis on the prison system.\u201d</p> <p>It was at college that he was first spotted to do some modelling and a friend suggested he go to Los Angeles to try to launch an acting career. He went to an audition for a 1995 movie called <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112715/\" title=\"\">Congo</a></em>, and got the part; roles in movies including <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bourne_Identity_(2002_film)\" title=\"\">The Bourne Identity</a> </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/28/thor-review\" title=\"\">Thor</a> </em>and (as Malko) in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/15/game-of-thrones-season-five-finale-episode-10-recap-mothers-mercy\" title=\"\">fifth season of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/15/game-of-thrones-season-five-finale-episode-10-recap-mothers-mercy\" title=\"\">Game of Thrones</a></em> followed, along with <em>Lost</em>. \u201cIt was not until I was on set and saw what was involved that I knew that the sum total of my life had led to this.

Though he is now more in touch with his Nigerian heritage, he never discussed the horrors of his childhood with his birth parents. He says: \u201cThey just thought, \u2018we did it all for you\u2019. \u201cI felt there was quite a bit of denial in that belief.\u201d</p> <p>He talks a little about subsequent difficulties in establishing relationships of his own: \u201cThere was this theme of abandonment in my life, and subsequently you make sure you reject before you get rejected, you put a wall up.\u201d He hasn\u2019t ruled out marriage and children: \u201cI am looking forward to that phase. I was 16 when this happened, I was 52 yesterday. I have had plenty of time to process it and my career as an actor has been a good tool for that. You can go through phases of bitterness and anger and hatred, but it has to have an expiry date, otherwise you are at a dead end.\u201d</p> <p>He became a Buddhist 27 years ago, and has been practising a Japanese regime of chanting morning and evening for 15 years. He says: \u201cIt allows you to hear the inner voice and not the anger. Once I started listening to that voice that\u2019s when I started writing.\u201d</p> <p>The first scene that he wrote was a long imaginary conversation with his foster mother, with whom he had the complicated relationship at the heart of the film. Loyalty to your parents is a powerful emotion, and Akinnuoye-Agbaje has had far more reason to wrestle with it than most. That first conversation he wrote down was an attempt to capture all the conflicted feelings in that. He says: \u201cYou have to remember that, whatever the motivation, they were quite extraordinary human beings to take on 10 Nigerian children in a terraced house in Tilbury in the 1970s, where no one had seen a black child before. They were ostracised because of it. It wasn\u2019t a picnic for them. I had to weigh all of that up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76a426cd32e318a3e21380ca547afc9d39f88df1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76a426cd32e318a3e21380ca547afc9d39f88df1/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young naked black male holding his crotch against a wall spray painted along with the words 'keep Britain white'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damson Idris playing the young Akinnuoye-Agbaje.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angus Young</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They became closer in some ways after he became an adult and established a life for himself that no one had imagined. He says: \u201cIn the years before they passed, in 2006, they tried to spend more time with me. That was perhaps to make up for what they knew was a very tough upbringing. What I hope comes through is that despite everything they were to a large degree heroes to me. Flawed, but we all have parents that do both good and do bad.\u201d</p> <p>Were they aware of the script and his ideas for the film, before they died?</p> <p>\u201cThey knew I was writing it, they had seen a short of it I made. My father said: \u2018All you can do is tell the truth.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What does he think they would have made of it? Would they have recognised themselves?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they would. And I think they would have been quite proud to be honest,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For himself, he hopes that now the film is done and out he can move on to directing other stories, in a different vein. His acting will continue, too, though I suggest there will never be a role to match that which he took on aged 16 in Tilbury. He smiles: \u201cIt\u2019s true, I was acting my butt off every day just to stay alive. Those were the best performances I ever gave.\u201d</p> <p><em>Farming is released on 11 October</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "There are some stories that, though they wait half a lifetime, must get told. Seven years ago, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje gave an interview to this paper in which he talked about his autobiographical film, Farming, which was then about to go into production after a dramatised reading of the script had headlined a Sundance festival promotion in London. At the time the actor was enjoying a measure of Hollywood fame for his role in the cult TV series Lost. Farming, which he had then already been writing and developing for nearly a decade, explored a real-life mystery: it was the incredible story of how he, a young Nigerian boy raised by white foster parents in 1970s Tilbury, Essex, had forged an identity for himself in a violently racist local skinhead gang, and lived to tell the tale. The film, which eventually premiered at the Toronto festival last year, goes on wider release this month. It both dramatises a brutal and moving coming-of-age and shines a light on a little-known chapter in the story of race relations in Britain: the practice that led to thousands of Nigerian children like Akinnuoye-Agbaje being \u2018farmed out\u2019 to British families in that period. When I met its creator last week in London, I suggested that having the film out in the world must produce many emotions in him, but I imagined that, given its long gestation, one of the primary ones is relief. Akinnuoye-Agbaje, back in London from his long-term home in Los Angeles, is a big-shouldered, charismatic presence, with an easy eloquence on many subjects, including his past. He agrees that \u201cthe film is an exhalation, and a huge one\u201d. He says: \u201cThe fact is, I literally first started writing the screenplay all those years ago because I could not sleep at night.\u201d In directing the film he has had to go through all the nightmarish boyhood trauma and violence it details for a second time. He says: \u201cA production designer rebuilt the house which for many years was the breeding ground for my own self-hatred. At the helm of a film you don\u2019t have the luxury of too much emotion, but afterwards, watching it, certainly.\u201d The film has provoked \u201can outpouring\u201d not only from his immediate family but from hundreds of other Nigerian British children who experienced something similar. Akinnuoye-Agbaje\u2019s parents were among a generation of Nigerians to come to the colonial \u201cmother country\u201d to get a university education they could take home and use to build democracy in their newly independent nation, then beset by civil war. His father came to study law, his mother accountancy. When he was a few months old, they placed a discreet advert in a local paper to find a family that could care for him while they studied and worked to pay for their degrees. The film begins with them handing over their child \u2013 and the first monthly payment for his care \u2013 to the family that responded to that advert in a dockside row of terrace houses in the outer reaches of east London. The scene raises many questions, most insistent of which is: what could they have been thinking? The film-maker has obviously given that question a great deal of thought.

The practice only really came to an end, he suggests, after stricter checks were put in place following the abuse and murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9 in 2000. In the intervening years, however, few of the foster arrangements could have been as extreme as the environment in which the film-maker found himself. He was one of at least 10 Nigerian children taken in by his foster parents and mostly raised by his new mother, Ingrid (played in the film with abrasive spirit by Kate Beckinsale) while her husband was away working as a lorry driver. All those children fell to earth in Tilbury, a fertile recruiting ground for nascent far-right groups in the years after Enoch Powell made his \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech.

But let\u2019s be clear,\u201d he claims, \u201cseveral of the guys I was with six months later were dead, and they were dead because of hammers to the head or whatever. It was a very real world that I conveyed.\u201d It was his foster mother who rescued him in the first instance. Unsure how to protect him from the gang, she contacted his birth family \u2013 and after one violent confrontation with his father (by now a successful lawyer in Nigeria) he was packed off to boarding school in Surrey. He first rejected that opportunity. Then, with the encouragement of a girlfriend and a teacher, eventually embraced education. He went on to study law at King\u2019s College London. \u201cPeople often ask me: how do you go from being a skinhead to having a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree?\u201d he says. He tells them: \u201cIntelligence is the ability to make the most of your circumstances, whether you are on the street or in a university. The big help was a teacher who helped to translate the language of the law into a vernacular I understood. Once I got that, I was off to the races.\u201d He laughs. \u201cObviously I had an intimate knowledge of breaking the law. My master\u2019s was in criminal justice; I did a thesis on the prison system.\u201d It was at college that he was first spotted to do some modelling and a friend suggested he go to Los Angeles to try to launch an acting career. He went to an audition for a 1995 movie called Congo, and got the part; roles in movies including The Bourne Identity and Thor and (as Malko) in the fifth season of Game of Thrones followed, along with Lost. \u201cIt was not until I was on set and saw what was involved that I knew that the sum total of my life had led to this. I was at home.\u201d His broken family history was harder to resolve. Though he is now more in touch with his Nigerian heritage, he never discussed the horrors of his childhood with his birth parents. He says: \u201cThey just thought, \u2018we did it all for you\u2019. \u201cI felt there was quite a bit of denial in that belief.\u201d He talks a little about subsequent difficulties in establishing relationships of his own: \u201cThere was this theme of abandonment in my life, and subsequently you make sure you reject before you get rejected, you put a wall up.\u201d He hasn\u2019t ruled out marriage and children: \u201cI am looking forward to that phase. I was 16 when this happened, I was 52 yesterday. I have had plenty of time to process it and my career as an actor has been a good tool for that. You can go through phases of bitterness and anger and hatred, but it has to have an expiry date, otherwise you are at a dead end.\u201d He became a Buddhist 27 years ago, and has been practising a Japanese regime of chanting morning and evening for 15 years. He says: \u201cIt allows you to hear the inner voice and not the anger. Once I started listening to that voice that\u2019s when I started writing.\u201d The first scene that he wrote was a long imaginary conversation with his foster mother, with whom he had the complicated relationship at the heart of the film. Loyalty to your parents is a powerful emotion, and Akinnuoye-Agbaje has had far more reason to wrestle with it than most. That first conversation he wrote down was an attempt to capture all the conflicted feelings in that. He says: \u201cYou have to remember that, whatever the motivation, they were quite extraordinary human beings to take on 10 Nigerian children in a terraced house in Tilbury in the 1970s, where no one had seen a black child before. They were ostracised because of it. It wasn\u2019t a picnic for them. I had to weigh all of that up.\u201d They became closer in some ways after he became an adult and established a life for himself that no one had imagined. He says: \u201cIn the years before they passed, in 2006, they tried to spend more time with me. That was perhaps to make up for what they knew was a very tough upbringing. What I hope comes through is that despite everything they were to a large degree heroes to me. Flawed, but we all have parents that do both good and do bad.\u201d Were they aware of the script and his ideas for the film, before they died? \u201cThey knew I was writing it, they had seen a short of it I made. My father said: \u2018All you can do is tell the truth.\u2019\u201d What does he think they would have made of it? Would they have recognised themselves? \u201cI\u2019m sure they would. And I think they would have been quite proud to be honest,\u201d he says. For himself, he hopes that now the film is done and out he can move on to directing other stories, in a different vein. His acting will continue, too, though I suggest there will never be a role to match that which he took on aged 16 in Tilbury. He smiles: \u201cIt\u2019s true, I was acting my butt off every day just to stay alive. Those were the best performances I ever gave.\u201d Farming is released on 11 October",

      "body": "<p>In the wake of the record-breaking success of 2017\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/10/it-review-enthusiastic-cine-literate-stephen-king-adaptation\" title=\"\">It</a></em> (dubbed \u201chorror\u2019s highest-grossing hit\u201d, albeit unadjusted for inflation), this follow-up brings the Stephen King story to an end, not with a whimper but with several spectacular bangs. More epic in both scope and length than its predecessor (the running time outstrips even Tarantino\u2019s ultra-indulgent <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/18/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-quentin-tarantino-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt\" title=\"\">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a></em>), Andy Muschietti\u2019s good-looking sequel has visual style to spare as it pits its now-adult antiheroes against an ever-expanding creepshow of shrieking scary monsters and crawly super creeps. From giant, drooling clowns to grotesque insect apparitions and spiderlike shape-shifters, <em>It Chapter Two</em> doesn\u2019t skimp on the funhouse theatrics, even riffing on a quotable moment from John Carpenter\u2019s <em>The Thing</em>, which remains a monstrous benchmark for mind-bending 80s horror. Yet in stretching its canvas so far, the film also bursts the balloon-like charm of its predecessor, throwing more at the audience while ultimately landing less of an engaging emotional punch.</p> <p>Twenty-seven years after the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/the-goonies-review-indomitable-all-american-innocence\" title=\"\">Goonies</a></em>-inflected adventures of the first film, the former members of the Losers\u2019 Club from Derry, Maine (now played by a new, grownup cast), have gone their separate ways, all but forgetting the oath they swore about their ghoulish childhood nemesis: \u201cIf it ever comes back, we\u2019ll come back too.\u201d Each has their own life, although the past still haunts them. Bill (James McAvoy) is a popular writer who has a problem with endings; Beverly (Jessica Chastain) has swapped an abusive father for an equally toxic husband; Ben (Jay Ryan) is still lovelorn despite remodelling himself as a ripped success story; Eddie (James Ransone) has retreated into risk assessment; Richie (Bill Hader) has funnelled his insecurities into standup comedy; and Stanley (Andy Bean) lives in terror of his childhood nightmare returning. Only Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) has stayed in Derry, awaiting an echo of former horrors that will call his comrades to \u201ccome home, come home\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ad25be61186089a8cc4c62d9e7c16a9a4b81762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ad25be61186089a8cc4c62d9e7c16a9a4b81762/0_0_3180_2120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, James Ransone, Isaiah Mustafa and Jay Ryan in It Chapter Two.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, James Ransone, Isaiah Mustafa and Jay Ryan in It Chapter Two.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brooke Palmer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things start promisingly with a nostalgic roundup that reunites the old gang in a Chinese restaurant, laying the table for what is to come. An encounter with devilish fortune cookies soon mutates into a shiversome set piece, the palpable chills of which are promptly undercut by a reassuring pay-off gag (\u201cCan we get the check?\u201d). This is a recurrent trope: whenever fear rears its ugly head, humour is swiftly deployed to rebalance the upbeat atmosphere, undercutting any genuine sense of dread. The titular beast may feed on fright, but this movie (like its predecessor) doesn\u2019t really want to scare us beyond delivering the odd jolt. For all its dark secrets (repressed guilt, violent homophobia, post-traumatic amnesia) and visions of sewers full of dead children, the film retains a mainstream popcorn sensibility, as carnivalesque as Derry\u2019s festival fairground.</p> <p>Nods to horror classics abound, from the ripped shower curtain of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/psycho-horror-hitchcock\" title=\"\">Psycho</a></em> to the \u201cHere\u2019s Johnny!\u201d refrain from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/24/the-shining-the-film-that-frightened-me-most\" title=\"\">The Shining</a></em>, but once again it\u2019s the family-friendly fantasies of Steven Spielberg that cast the longest shadow. From cave-bound Indiana Jones-style action to otherworldly sequences that play out like the third act of <em>Poltergeist</em> (the PG-rated horror on which writer-producer Spielberg cracked the whip), Muschietti draws heavily on the <em>ET</em> director\u2019s back catalogue. When Bill buys back his childhood bike from a grouchy antiquities dealer (one of several cute cameos), you half-expect it to fly.</p> <p>There are some elegantly orchestrated transitions between the young and old incarnations of these characters, although an abundance of flashbacks threatens to overcomplicate an already multistranded narrative. At times, the story becomes so episodic that it starts to feel like a TV miniseries, reminding us of Tommy Lee Wallace\u2019s flawed yet oddly beloved 1990 adaptation. But for all its talk about remembering and forgetting \u2013 the interplay between past and present \u2013 the film still seems to function largely in the moment, offering fleeting thrills that work in isolation rather than in context. The best of these are eerily understated: a lilting sing-song sentence from the leering Pennywise (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, still excellently sinister); a glimpse of an old woman moving in a mysterious way, recalling the scuttling of Mrs Clelia in <em>The Exorcist III</em> or the reverse-spooled staccato stride of Sadako from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/ring-nakata-ringu-horror\" title=\"\">Ringu</a></em>.</p> <p>Benjamin Wallfisch\u2019s expansive score amplifies the sense of adventure, while Checco Varese\u2019s widescreen cinematography effectively counterposes bright vistas with dark spaces. It adds up to a peculiar mix of the crowd-pleasing and the patience-testing, veering wildly between the entertaining and the frustrating, built round a story that ventures inexorably underground without ever getting to the heart of what lies beneath.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5P7Up3jA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xhJ5P7Up3jA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCLT_iQQ_38\">Watch a trailer for It Chapter Two.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

More epic in both scope and length than its predecessor (the running time outstrips even Tarantino\u2019s ultra-indulgent Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Andy Muschietti\u2019s good-looking sequel has visual style to spare as it pits its now-adult antiheroes against an ever-expanding creepshow of shrieking scary monsters and crawly super creeps. From giant, drooling clowns to grotesque insect apparitions and spiderlike shape-shifters, It Chapter Two doesn\u2019t skimp on the funhouse theatrics, even riffing on a quotable moment from John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing, which remains a monstrous benchmark for mind-bending 80s horror. Yet in stretching its canvas so far, the film also bursts the balloon-like charm of its predecessor, throwing more at the audience while ultimately landing less of an engaging emotional punch. Twenty-seven years after the Goonies-inflected adventures of the first film, the former members of the Losers\u2019 Club from Derry, Maine (now played by a new, grownup cast), have gone their separate ways, all but forgetting the oath they swore about their ghoulish childhood nemesis: \u201cIf it ever comes back, we\u2019ll come back too.\u201d Each has their own life, although the past still haunts them. Bill (James McAvoy) is a popular writer who has a problem with endings; Beverly (Jessica Chastain) has swapped an abusive father for an equally toxic husband; Ben (Jay Ryan) is still lovelorn despite remodelling himself as a ripped success story; Eddie (James Ransone) has retreated into risk assessment; Richie (Bill Hader) has funnelled his insecurities into standup comedy; and Stanley (Andy Bean) lives in terror of his childhood nightmare returning. Only Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) has stayed in Derry, awaiting an echo of former horrors that will call his comrades to \u201ccome home, come home\u201d. Things start promisingly with a nostalgic roundup that reunites the old gang in a Chinese restaurant, laying the table for what is to come. An encounter with devilish fortune cookies soon mutates into a shiversome set piece, the palpable chills of which are promptly undercut by a reassuring pay-off gag (\u201cCan we get the check?\u201d). This is a recurrent trope: whenever fear rears its ugly head, humour is swiftly deployed to rebalance the upbeat atmosphere, undercutting any genuine sense of dread. The titular beast may feed on fright, but this movie (like its predecessor) doesn\u2019t really want to scare us beyond delivering the odd jolt. For all its dark secrets (repressed guilt, violent homophobia, post-traumatic amnesia) and visions of sewers full of dead children, the film retains a mainstream popcorn sensibility, as carnivalesque as Derry\u2019s festival fairground. Nods to horror classics abound, from the ripped shower curtain of Psycho to the \u201cHere\u2019s Johnny!\u201d refrain from The Shining, but once again it\u2019s the family-friendly fantasies of Steven Spielberg that cast the longest shadow. From cave-bound Indiana Jones-style action to otherworldly sequences that play out like the third act of Poltergeist (the PG-rated horror on which writer-producer Spielberg cracked the whip), Muschietti draws heavily on the ET director\u2019s back catalogue. When Bill buys back his childhood bike from a grouchy antiquities dealer (one of several cute cameos), you half-expect it to fly. There are some elegantly orchestrated transitions between the young and old incarnations of these characters, although an abundance of flashbacks threatens to overcomplicate an already multistranded narrative. At times, the story becomes so episodic that it starts to feel like a TV miniseries, reminding us of Tommy Lee Wallace\u2019s flawed yet oddly beloved 1990 adaptation. But for all its talk about remembering and forgetting \u2013 the interplay between past and present \u2013 the film still seems to function largely in the moment, offering fleeting thrills that work in isolation rather than in context. The best of these are eerily understated: a lilting sing-song sentence from the leering Pennywise (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, still excellently sinister); a glimpse of an old woman moving in a mysterious way, recalling the scuttling of Mrs Clelia in The Exorcist III or the reverse-spooled staccato stride of Sadako from Ringu. Benjamin Wallfisch\u2019s expansive score amplifies the sense of adventure, while Checco Varese\u2019s widescreen cinematography effectively counterposes bright vistas with dark spaces. It adds up to a peculiar mix of the crowd-pleasing and the patience-testing, veering wildly between the entertaining and the frustrating, built round a story that ventures inexorably underground without ever getting to the heart of what lies beneath.",

      "body": "<p>Gillian Anderson is a woman of many duelling qualities, and it is hard to know quite what to expect when meeting her. Her old interviews are displays of either surprising candour or frosty reserve. She can be earnest and thoughtful, sometimes to the point of seeming grave, yet she peppers her social media with \u201cpenis/yoni of the day\u201d posts, pictures of things that happen to look like genitals, even when they are not. She speaks with an American accent when with Americans, and with a crisp British accent with Brits, though she retains a US sheen on only one word that I clocked: \u201cprocess\u201d. She is extremely famous and has been for more than half her life, yet has maintained a sense of mystery and intrigue, and is keenly private.</p> <p>Naturally, then, in a photographic studio in a tiny back street in north London, talk has turned to tattoos of Anderson\u2019s face on strangers\u2019 buttocks. It started with one of her own cashmere jumpers, part of her new capsule collection for the London brand <a href=\"https://www.winserlondon.com/shop/the-edits/gillian-anderson\" title=\"\">Winser</a> (she turned designer for them in 2018, adding another string to an already creaking bow that includes activist and author, as well as actor) that features a familiar-looking mouth emblazoned across the chest, accented by that Monroe-esque beauty spot.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a strange thing, yes,\u201d she agrees, adding that of all the pieces, she probably won\u2019t make a habit of wearing the one with her own face on it. It\u2019s an impish design, but this being Anderson, there\u2019s more to it than a bit of self-reflective fun: some of its profits will go to <a href=\"https://www.womenforwomen.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Women </a><a href=\"https://www.womenforwomen.org.uk/\" title=\"\">for Women</a>, which helps support female survivors of conflict.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9911573ff091e4cdf68fc1b25dfabe5e0cb198f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9911573ff091e4cdf68fc1b25dfabe5e0cb198f1/0_495_7924_4755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Anderson OBSERVER MAG USE ONLY\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The silly side of me has always been there\u2019: Gillian Anderson wears dress by Prada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWell, the way that started was, a fan showed up with a T-shirt that she had made with my mouth on it. Which I recognised, and I went, \u2018Wait, is that\u2026?\u2019\u201d That might be an unnerving experience for most people, but Anderson has to admit that for her, it is not so out of the ordinary. \u201cI\u2019m kind of used to it,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cEspecially because of my old job. The enthusiasm of the fans, from being in something that\u2019s remotely science fiction, is more intense. And so I\u2019m used to tattoos on calves and buttocks and stuff like that.\u201d</p> <p>In 1993, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-x-files\" title=\"\">The X</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-x-files\" title=\"\"> Files</a></em> arrived on television, with Anderson at the helm as the sceptical FBI agent Dana Scully. She had just turned 25, and she found herself at the frenzied frontier of a cultural phenomenon. The tattoos soon followed.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really early on, actually. I had gone to Australia to do press, and somebody had David Duchovny and me on their buttocks, and were offering to show us.\u201d She laughs. The thought of what they might look like now tickles her. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we are both less\u2026 chubby-cheeked?\u201d</p> <p>Anderson has been wrangling with what is public and private for the past three decades. Recently, she has found herself having to think about it again. <em>The X</em><em> Files</em> came back in 2016, after 14 years away, and now there is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/11/sex-education-review-netflix-asa-butterfield-gillian-anderson\" title=\"\">Sex Education</a></em>, the Netflix teen comedy-drama in which she plays a sex therapist. \u201cThis has gone to a completely different level,\u201d she smiles. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been in something that is so universally watched as this is. Even when I did <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-fall\" title=\"\">The Fall</a></em>, it was popular, but it wasn\u2019t Netflix popular, you know? So the level of recognition has gone up to what it was when I was younger.\u201d The trouble is that she forgets. \u201cI\u2019m so used to sliding under the radar that there have been some situations recently where it\u2019s just been\u2026 a lot. Travelling with kids and stuff. You don\u2019t want to be that person. You want to be like, ah, thanks!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51950e505dc40eb341e19dd6a19c792cd4030de7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51950e505dc40eb341e19dd6a19c792cd4030de7/0_55_1807_1084/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny in the X-Files, a field of tall crops behind them\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The enthusiasm of fans, from being in science fiction, is intense\u2019: in the X-Files, which aired from 1993 when she was 25.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/20 Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She has three children; two boys, Oscar and Felix, aged 10 and 12, while her daughter, Piper, is 24. At the height of <em>X Files</em> mania, when Piper was young, Anderson was followed constantly by paparazzi. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take my daughter to the park without long lenses and stuff. If that were the case here, I would not live here. I cannot stand it,\u201d she says, crisply.</p> <p>She was born in the US, but spent her early childhood in north London, before moving back to the States when she was 11. She speaks fondly of London, of its green spaces and its vibrancy, and it is where she has lived for most of her adult life. \u201cIn my formative years, my experience of private life was quite public. And I had a very different experience here in the UK, if one knows what neighbourhoods to stay out of and what restaurants to stay away from. And also, it\u2019s just always felt like this is where I belong.\u201d She is superstitious enough to curse herself for what she is about to say, but here, she explains, she doesn\u2019t have photographers on her doorstep. \u201cIt\u2019s that part of it that has made me really hate the business that I\u2019m in, at times.\u201d</p> <p>When she is working, Anderson says, she can be quite unpredictable. \u201cDepending on the day and what I\u2019m working on, and my need to focus or whatever, I can be very relaxed and jovial, and then sometimes I can be serious and slightly shut down. I\u2019m sure that must be confusing for people.\u201d I tell her I wasn\u2019t quite sure, from reading old interviews, who I was going to meet. She says that if she were to read an old interview with herself, which she doesn\u2019t, she could tell you which ones happened during periods of intense paparazzi interest, based on how frosty she was. \u201cIt makes you paranoid. I just completely clam up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ca79a301534971435d42b9558a95a417d407e42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ca79a301534971435d42b9558a95a417d407e42/0_385_3850_2309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Anderson wearing her own Gillian Anderson for Winser London roll neck.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I had a very different experience here in the UK \u2013 it\u2019s always felt like this is where I belong\u2019: wearing her own Gillian Anderson for Winser London roll neck.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, she is perfectly open and friendly. Women, particularly, do seem to like her. \u201cI do feel like a woman\u2019s woman, and I go out of my way to be one. And actually I get so shocked and shaken when I come across women who aren\u2019t. It really unsettles me.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson has played so many iconic characters, and almost all of them have shared a solitary, mournful quality, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/dec/27/great-expectations-review-sam-wollaston\" title=\"\">Miss Havisham</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/may/11/the-fall-gillian-anderson\" title=\"\">Stella Gibson</a>, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/charles-dickens-bleak-house-book-that-changed-me\" title=\"\">Lady Dedlock</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/03/gillian-anderson-compelling-streetcar-named-desire-observer-review\" title=\"\">Blanche DuBois</a> in <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>, who is not always played as a model of restraint. <em>Sex Education</em>, though, has given her the chance to be funny. Her character Jean is a nightmarishly frank parent, for whom oversharing does not exist, and Anderson has run with it. Her Twitter bio is still Shag Specialist. \u201cOh, is it?\u201d she says, coyly. \u201cI guess I\u2019m still the shag specialist. At least until <em>Sex Education</em> is off the air.\u201d Her social media has certainly taken on a fruitier twist. \u201cMostly, that\u2019s the penis and yoni of the day,\u201d she says. People send in images of accidental genitalia, and her team backlogs them, and posts them. \u201cIt\u2019s important!\u201d she laughs. It also shows off her sillier side. \u201cI mean, I feel like the silly side of me has always been there. Just in terms of the kind of humour. For a long time, Chewbacca was my boyfriend. I don\u2019t know if you know that, but we were dating for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>She says this so matter-of-factly that it almost passes me by. Hold on, I say. Chewbacca? \u201cI can\u2019t remember whether it predates me taking a picture at a comic-con with the real Chewbacca. That might have been the beginning or it might have just been our first outing.\u201d Either way, it turns out, she enjoyed a longstanding digital relationship with the <em>Star Wars</em> stalwart, which led to fans sending her a wild selection of Chewbacca memorabilia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ba62b15a75aa18f640961e2bd4ad23a91deafe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ba62b15a75aa18f640961e2bd4ad23a91deafe9/922_1001_5798_3479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Asa Butterfield on a sofa playing the no-boundaries therapist Jean in Netflix\u2019s Sex Education.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I guess I\u2019m still the shag specialist\u2019: as the no-boundaries therapist in Netflix\u2019s Sex Education.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Taylor/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThen, when I knew that I had started to date somebody in real life, I had announced at some point that Chewbacca and I had broken up.\u201d That was quite the declaration of commitment, to leave Chewbacca for your boyfriend. \u201cOh no, no, no. Let\u2019s be clear. They didn\u2019t overlap.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson\u2019s boyfriend \u2013 no overlap \u2013 is Peter Morgan, the screenwriter and playwright who is currently at the helm of <em>The Crown</em>. Anderson is about to start work on the fourth season, in which she\u2019ll play Margaret Thatcher; she is both keen to talk about it and wary of letting anything slip. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite figured out how to talk about her yet.\u201d She has immersed herself in reading and watching everything she can find. \u201cTo a certain degree, it\u2019s very helpful for an actor, at least in my experience, to slightly fall in love with the character you\u2019re playing, regardless of what your opinion might be of them, if it\u2019s a historical character, particularly. So I have.\u201d</p> <p>She is finding Thatcher \u201cabsolutely fascinating. Mostly because of her childhood. You could draw such a clear line from how she was raised and what she was exposed to in their religion, and how she was raised in the shop, and how she worked, and their work ethic and their beliefs. Just everything that came later stems so entirely from her childhood. But that in and of itself is fascinating, and \u2013 I\u2019m not going to use the word <em>forgivable</em>, but one can find compassion.\u201d She is excited to work with Olivia Colman, who will be her Queen, for the first time. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the third season, and she\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ece362b40facdcba8f9f1bd7db734f0847f98cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ece362b40facdcba8f9f1bd7db734f0847f98cf/506_407_2249_4446/506.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I like to think I am a women\u2019s woman\u2019: GillianAnderson for Winser London silk georgette blouse; stretch wool trousers by Stella McCartney; shoes by Rupert Sanderson and earrings by Alighitheri.\" width=\"506\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I like to think I am a women\u2019s woman\u2019: Gillian Anderson for Winser London silk georgette blouse; stretch wool trousers by Stella McCartney; shoes by Rupert Sanderson and earrings by Alighitheri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February, she appeared in London\u2019s West End as Margo Channing, the role made famous by Bette Davis, in Ivo van Hove\u2019s stage adaptation of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/13/all-about-eve-review-classic-hollywood-updated-with-technical-wizardry\" title=\"\">All About Eve</a></em>. It is the story of a famous woman facing the horrors of age in an industry that is not sympathetic to it, and I wonder if Anderson felt any significance in playing her when she herself was 50. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, firmly. \u201cIn the film, Margo had just turned 40. The point wasn\u2019t that I as an actress was trying to do something younger. In fact, we raised the ages of everyone by 10 years.\u201d Her eyes flash, and she suddenly gives the impression of a cat teasing its prey. \u201cIs there another part to that question?\u201d she purrs.</p> <p>Well, some of the reviews had an issue with the idea of you as an ageing actress at all; you weren\u2019t \u201cageing\u201d enough to be worried about ageing. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really the point,\u201d she says, with a sigh. \u201cFirstly, so many of our issues about ageing, as men and women, have absolutely nothing to do with reality. It\u2019s so much to do with our own perception or what we think other people\u2019s perception is, to the point that 20-year-olds are having plastic surgery and Botox, because they believe that if there\u2019s some sign of a wrinkle, or if they\u2019re flat-chested or whatever, that that\u2019s bad. So for a 50-year-old woman to be concerned about it makes sense, especially given that that\u2019s her career.\u201d</p> <p>She is on a roll; she loves talking about her characters. \u201cBut also it wasn\u2019t just about that. It was about her value, her value in her work, her value to her husband, not her value to her public, necessarily. So I was shocked at the small-mindedness of some of the reactions to it, in terms of just not understanding the psychology of human beings, and where lies fear, and one\u2019s currency in one\u2019s personal life and in one\u2019s work life.\u201d She takes a big breath, smiling. \u201cAnyway!\u201d</p> <p>It will be a while before we see her on stage again. She likes to break up theatre roles, leaving gaps of a few years in between them. \u201cI\u2019ve had such fear and anxiety around it, and there have been so many times when I\u2019ve been in the middle of it thinking, I must be mad to be doing it again.\u201d</p> <p>Blanche DuBois, in particular, was tough. \u201c<em>Streetcar</em> was something else entirely. Even in the short runs that we did here and in the US, it really takes it out of one. I mean, there was a point where I thought I might be losing touch with reality, which is known to happen during that play.\u201d Has she thought about doing a comedy? \u201cWell, <em>Sex Education</em> is a gift in that way. There\u2019s funny stuff in this second season.\u201d</p> <p>During <em>Sex Education</em>\u2019s first run, Anderson\u2019s hair was icy white. Today, it\u2019s a light strawberry blonde again. She went white initially just to try it, for herself, and it seemed to fit Jean\u2019s character, so she kept it. \u201cBut then my hair started to fall out.\u201d She lifts up her hair to show me her roots. Her natural colour is a mousey brown, with only the odd grey strand, though she has thought about going grey. \u201cOh, I would, yes, and I\u2019ve thought about it quite a lot, actually, when I had that hair.

      "bodyText": "Gillian Anderson is a woman of many duelling qualities, and it is hard to know quite what to expect when meeting her. Her old interviews are displays of either surprising candour or frosty reserve. She can be earnest and thoughtful, sometimes to the point of seeming grave, yet she peppers her social media with \u201cpenis/yoni of the day\u201d posts, pictures of things that happen to look like genitals, even when they are not. She speaks with an American accent when with Americans, and with a crisp British accent with Brits, though she retains a US sheen on only one word that I clocked: \u201cprocess\u201d. She is extremely famous and has been for more than half her life, yet has maintained a sense of mystery and intrigue, and is keenly private. Naturally, then, in a photographic studio in a tiny back street in north London, talk has turned to tattoos of Anderson\u2019s face on strangers\u2019 buttocks. It started with one of her own cashmere jumpers, part of her new capsule collection for the London brand Winser (she turned designer for them in 2018, adding another string to an already creaking bow that includes activist and author, as well as actor) that features a familiar-looking mouth emblazoned across the chest, accented by that Monroe-esque beauty spot. \u201cIt is a strange thing, yes,\u201d she agrees, adding that of all the pieces, she probably won\u2019t make a habit of wearing the one with her own face on it. It\u2019s an impish design, but this being Anderson, there\u2019s more to it than a bit of self-reflective fun: some of its profits will go to Women for Women, which helps support female survivors of conflict. \u201cWell, the way that started was, a fan showed up with a T-shirt that she had made with my mouth on it. Which I recognised, and I went, \u2018Wait, is that\u2026?\u2019\u201d That might be an unnerving experience for most people, but Anderson has to admit that for her, it is not so out of the ordinary. \u201cI\u2019m kind of used to it,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cEspecially because of my old job. The enthusiasm of the fans, from being in something that\u2019s remotely science fiction, is more intense. And so I\u2019m used to tattoos on calves and buttocks and stuff like that.\u201d In 1993, The X Files arrived on television, with Anderson at the helm as the sceptical FBI agent Dana Scully. She had just turned 25, and she found herself at the frenzied frontier of a cultural phenomenon. The tattoos soon followed. \u201cIt was really early on, actually. I had gone to Australia to do press, and somebody had David Duchovny and me on their buttocks, and were offering to show us.\u201d She laughs. The thought of what they might look like now tickles her. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we are both less\u2026 chubby-cheeked?\u201d Anderson has been wrangling with what is public and private for the past three decades. Recently, she has found herself having to think about it again. The X Files came back in 2016, after 14 years away, and now there is Sex Education, the Netflix teen comedy-drama in which she plays a sex therapist. \u201cThis has gone to a completely different level,\u201d she smiles. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been in something that is so universally watched as this is. Even when I did The Fall, it was popular, but it wasn\u2019t Netflix popular, you know? So the level of recognition has gone up to what it was when I was younger.\u201d The trouble is that she forgets. \u201cI\u2019m so used to sliding under the radar that there have been some situations recently where it\u2019s just been\u2026 a lot. Travelling with kids and stuff. You don\u2019t want to be that person. You want to be like, ah, thanks!\u201d She has three children; two boys, Oscar and Felix, aged 10 and 12, while her daughter, Piper, is 24. At the height of X Files mania, when Piper was young, Anderson was followed constantly by paparazzi. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take my daughter to the park without long lenses and stuff. If that were the case here, I would not live here. I cannot stand it,\u201d she says, crisply. She was born in the US, but spent her early childhood in north London, before moving back to the States when she was 11. She speaks fondly of London, of its green spaces and its vibrancy, and it is where she has lived for most of her adult life. \u201cIn my formative years, my experience of private life was quite public. And I had a very different experience here in the UK, if one knows what neighbourhoods to stay out of and what restaurants to stay away from. And also, it\u2019s just always felt like this is where I belong.\u201d She is superstitious enough to curse herself for what she is about to say, but here, she explains, she doesn\u2019t have photographers on her doorstep. \u201cIt\u2019s that part of it that has made me really hate the business that I\u2019m in, at times.\u201d When she is working, Anderson says, she can be quite unpredictable. \u201cDepending on the day and what I\u2019m working on, and my need to focus or whatever, I can be very relaxed and jovial, and then sometimes I can be serious and slightly shut down. I\u2019m sure that must be confusing for people.\u201d I tell her I wasn\u2019t quite sure, from reading old interviews, who I was going to meet. She says that if she were to read an old interview with herself, which she doesn\u2019t, she could tell you which ones happened during periods of intense paparazzi interest, based on how frosty she was. \u201cIt makes you paranoid. I just completely clam up.\u201d Today, she is perfectly open and friendly. Women, particularly, do seem to like her. \u201cI do feel like a woman\u2019s woman, and I go out of my way to be one. And actually I get so shocked and shaken when I come across women who aren\u2019t. It really unsettles me.\u201d Anderson has played so many iconic characters, and almost all of them have shared a solitary, mournful quality, from Miss Havisham to Stella Gibson, from Lady Dedlock to Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire, who is not always played as a model of restraint. Sex Education, though, has given her the chance to be funny. Her character Jean is a nightmarishly frank parent, for whom oversharing does not exist, and Anderson has run with it. Her Twitter bio is still Shag Specialist. \u201cOh, is it?\u201d she says, coyly. \u201cI guess I\u2019m still the shag specialist. At least until Sex Education is off the air.\u201d Her social media has certainly taken on a fruitier twist. \u201cMostly, that\u2019s the penis and yoni of the day,\u201d she says. People send in images of accidental genitalia, and her team backlogs them, and posts them. \u201cIt\u2019s important!\u201d she laughs. It also shows off her sillier side. \u201cI mean, I feel like the silly side of me has always been there. Just in terms of the kind of humour. For a long time, Chewbacca was my boyfriend. I don\u2019t know if you know that, but we were dating for a long time.\u201d She says this so matter-of-factly that it almost passes me by. Hold on, I say. Chewbacca? \u201cI can\u2019t remember whether it predates me taking a picture at a comic-con with the real Chewbacca. That might have been the beginning or it might have just been our first outing.\u201d Either way, it turns out, she enjoyed a longstanding digital relationship with the Star Wars stalwart, which led to fans sending her a wild selection of Chewbacca memorabilia. \u201cThen, when I knew that I had started to date somebody in real life, I had announced at some point that Chewbacca and I had broken up.\u201d That was quite the declaration of commitment, to leave Chewbacca for your boyfriend. \u201cOh no, no, no. Let\u2019s be clear. They didn\u2019t overlap.\u201d Anderson\u2019s boyfriend \u2013 no overlap \u2013 is Peter Morgan, the screenwriter and playwright who is currently at the helm of The Crown. Anderson is about to start work on the fourth season, in which she\u2019ll play Margaret Thatcher; she is both keen to talk about it and wary of letting anything slip. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite figured out how to talk about her yet.\u201d She has immersed herself in reading and watching everything she can find. \u201cTo a certain degree, it\u2019s very helpful for an actor, at least in my experience, to slightly fall in love with the character you\u2019re playing, regardless of what your opinion might be of them, if it\u2019s a historical character, particularly. So I have.\u201d She is finding Thatcher \u201cabsolutely fascinating. Mostly because of her childhood. You could draw such a clear line from how she was raised and what she was exposed to in their religion, and how she was raised in the shop, and how she worked, and their work ethic and their beliefs. Just everything that came later stems so entirely from her childhood. But that in and of itself is fascinating, and \u2013 I\u2019m not going to use the word forgivable, but one can find compassion.\u201d She is excited to work with Olivia Colman, who will be her Queen, for the first time. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the third season, and she\u2019s amazing.\u201d In February, she appeared in London\u2019s West End as Margo Channing, the role made famous by Bette Davis, in Ivo van Hove\u2019s stage adaptation of All About Eve. It is the story of a famous woman facing the horrors of age in an industry that is not sympathetic to it, and I wonder if Anderson felt any significance in playing her when she herself was 50. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, firmly. \u201cIn the film, Margo had just turned 40. The point wasn\u2019t that I as an actress was trying to do something younger. In fact, we raised the ages of everyone by 10 years.\u201d Her eyes flash, and she suddenly gives the impression of a cat teasing its prey. \u201cIs there another part to that question?\u201d she purrs. Well, some of the reviews had an issue with the idea of you as an ageing actress at all; you weren\u2019t \u201cageing\u201d enough to be worried about ageing. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really the point,\u201d she says, with a sigh. \u201cFirstly, so many of our issues about ageing, as men and women, have absolutely nothing to do with reality. It\u2019s so much to do with our own perception or what we think other people\u2019s perception is, to the point that 20-year-olds are having plastic surgery and Botox, because they believe that if there\u2019s some sign of a wrinkle, or if they\u2019re flat-chested or whatever, that that\u2019s bad. So for a 50-year-old woman to be concerned about it makes sense, especially given that that\u2019s her career.\u201d She is on a roll; she loves talking about her characters. \u201cBut also it wasn\u2019t just about that. It was about her value, her value in her work, her value to her husband, not her value to her public, necessarily. So I was shocked at the small-mindedness of some of the reactions to it, in terms of just not understanding the psychology of human beings, and where lies fear, and one\u2019s currency in one\u2019s personal life and in one\u2019s work life.\u201d She takes a big breath, smiling. \u201cAnyway!\u201d It will be a while before we see her on stage again. She likes to break up theatre roles, leaving gaps of a few years in between them. \u201cI\u2019ve had such fear and anxiety around it, and there have been so many times when I\u2019ve been in the middle of it thinking, I must be mad to be doing it again.\u201d Blanche DuBois, in particular, was tough. \u201cStreetcar was something else entirely. Even in the short runs that we did here and in the US, it really takes it out of one. I mean, there was a point where I thought I might be losing touch with reality, which is known to happen during that play.\u201d Has she thought about doing a comedy? \u201cWell, Sex Education is a gift in that way. There\u2019s funny stuff in this second season.\u201d During Sex Education\u2019s first run, Anderson\u2019s hair was icy white. Today, it\u2019s a light strawberry blonde again. She went white initially just to try it, for herself, and it seemed to fit Jean\u2019s character, so she kept it. \u201cBut then my hair started to fall out.\u201d She lifts up her hair to show me her roots. Her natural colour is a mousey brown, with only the odd grey strand, though she has thought about going grey. \u201cOh, I would, yes, and I\u2019ve thought about it quite a lot, actually, when I had that hair. I absolutely would. It\u2019s occurred to me that to decide to have it natural, as an actor, is quite a big decision. But it\u2019s interesting, because when I first did it, I thought, it\u2019s kind of cool, in an Annie Lennox, Billy Idol-ey kind of way.\u201d For a second, Anderson offers a glimpse of the teenage punk she was. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in your 50s, it just looks like you\u2019ve got grey hair. So I look forward to that, but I\u2019m not ready yet, to deal with the consequences of it, which would be, presumably, that I would naturally be cast in a different zone of characters.\u201d We meet a few days before her 51st birthday. She celebrated the big day last summer with three small parties, in London, in Canada and in the US. \u201cBut it was only five people, six, and 13,\u201d she says, merrily. \u201cThose are all the friends I have.\u201d She likes to be alone, and is a happily solitary person; the idea of a big party felt both presumptuous and like it was inviting \u201ctoo much attention.

Set in Henan province in 1992 and directed by Michael Boyd, former artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, it centres on the danger a young ministry of health official finds herself in when she is recruited into a new medical trade in human blood and uncovers a terrible secret.</p> <p>Boyd condemned the pressure that Wang\u2019s relatives were under but said: \u201cWe will do what Shuping wants, and she really wants this play to go on.\u201d</p> <p>The plot closely follows the battle Wang and her colleagues waged to uncover the truth. \u201cI first reported the HCV [hepatitis] epidemic among blood donors to the Ministry of Health of PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] in 1992,\u201d said Wang. \u201cThree years later, I discovered and reported a serious HIV epidemic among the plasma donors to the Health Bureau of Zhoukou Region and the ministry of health of the PRC ... Only after I reported my results to the central government in Beijing was any action taken. They requested that I falsify my information about the HIV epidemic situation among the plasma donors but I refused. To cover up the HIV epidemic situation, they broke up our clinical testing centre, hit me with a heavy stick and insulted me.\u201d </p> <p>Wang resisted pressure to close her laboratory, but the health bureau cut off the electricity and water supplies, forcing it to discard thousands of blood samples.</p> <p>Wang, an American citizen, learned of the visits that were \u201ccausing panic\u201d in her home town in a phone call from a relative last month. </p> <p>The allegation of renewed pressure on Wang and her associates comes as both China\u2019s government and its citizens become increasingly assertive internationally. The foreign policy maxim of the former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping \u2013 \u201chide your strength, bide your time\u201d \u2013 has been cast aside as Chinese economic power and global influence has grown. Instead, shows of strength have attempted to influence how China is depicted internationally.</p> <p>\u201cIt is worrying that China is not bothered that it will be seen to be doing this. It is a sign of its confidence,\u201d said Boyd.</p> <p>In her statement, Wang said punishing relatives and colleagues of people who spoke out against the leadership was commonplace inside China.</p> <p>\u201cWith bullying and censorship, the government has covered up the HCV and HIV epidemics in China very successfully,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy, in 2019, do they worry so much about a play being produced in London, 24 years after the events it depicts?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chinese security officials have been accused of targeting a whistleblower\u2019s family and friends in a campaign to force a theatre to abandon a play based on her case. Dr Shuping Wang, who exposed the spread of hepatitis and HIV infection through contaminated blood and plasma in China two decades ago, has said her relatives and former colleagues in Henan province are being told they should persuade her to drop the show at the London\u2019s Hampstead Theatre. She said the incident had revived memories of the original whistleblowing, but was determined that the show, The King of Hell\u2019s Palace, should go ahead. \u201cThe only thing harder than standing up to the government and their security police is not giving in to pressure from friends and relatives who are threatened with their livelihoods, all because you are speaking out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut even after all this time, I will still not be silenced, even though I am deeply sad that this intimidation is happening yet again.\u201d Wang said officials had also tried to obtain contact details for her daughter, in an attempt to exert pressure on her. \u201cI am particularly concerned for my daughter, who is very scared about being approached,\u201d she said, adding that former colleagues in Beijing were afraid to answer her phone calls and emails since high-level officials had visited. \u201cTheir reason is that this play will embarrass and damage the Chinese government and the reputations of specific officials.\u201d The play, written by Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig and due to open on Friday, is a thriller inspired by the true story of Wang\u2019s \u201cextraordinary mission to expose a cover-up of epic proportions\u201d. Set in Henan province in 1992 and directed by Michael Boyd, former artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, it centres on the danger a young ministry of health official finds herself in when she is recruited into a new medical trade in human blood and uncovers a terrible secret. Boyd condemned the pressure that Wang\u2019s relatives were under but said: \u201cWe will do what Shuping wants, and she really wants this play to go on.\u201d The plot closely follows the battle Wang and her colleagues waged to uncover the truth. \u201cI first reported the HCV [hepatitis] epidemic among blood donors to the Ministry of Health of PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] in 1992,\u201d said Wang. \u201cThree years later, I discovered and reported a serious HIV epidemic among the plasma donors to the Health Bureau of Zhoukou Region and the ministry of health of the PRC ... Only after I reported my results to the central government in Beijing was any action taken. They requested that I falsify my information about the HIV epidemic situation among the plasma donors but I refused. To cover up the HIV epidemic situation, they broke up our clinical testing centre, hit me with a heavy stick and insulted me.\u201d Wang resisted pressure to close her laboratory, but the health bureau cut off the electricity and water supplies, forcing it to discard thousands of blood samples. Wang, an American citizen, learned of the visits that were \u201ccausing panic\u201d in her home town in a phone call from a relative last month. The allegation of renewed pressure on Wang and her associates comes as both China\u2019s government and its citizens become increasingly assertive internationally. The foreign policy maxim of the former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping \u2013 \u201chide your strength, bide your time\u201d \u2013 has been cast aside as Chinese economic power and global influence has grown. Instead, shows of strength have attempted to influence how China is depicted internationally. \u201cIt is worrying that China is not bothered that it will be seen to be doing this. It is a sign of its confidence,\u201d said Boyd. In her statement, Wang said punishing relatives and colleagues of people who spoke out against the leadership was commonplace inside China. \u201cWith bullying and censorship, the government has covered up the HCV and HIV epidemics in China very successfully,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy, in 2019, do they worry so much about a play being produced in London, 24 years after the events it depicts?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Because Boris Johnson has such a notoriously casual relationship with the truth, there is a tendency not to take him seriously, even on the occasions when he is probably speaking with an unforked tongue. So there has been a lot of derision for his declaration that he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline.</p> \n<p>Seriously? Even if instructed to do so by the legislation that will be written into the statute book this week? Would he break the law, a ditch no previous occupant of his office has chosen to expire in? That, I think, is ultimately unlikely. He wouldn\u2019t like the food in prison. So might he resign as prime minister rather than carry out parliament\u2019s orders? Yes, I think he might do that. He would not want to quit. He may not have realised yet that the positions he has taken will compel him in that direction. But I think we may get to the point where resignation from Number 10, taking his government with him, ends up being his least worst option. He has been boxed by parliamentary votes that will not let him have a no-deal Brexit. He has been coxed by the opposition refusing him an election. The one thing they can\u2019t stop him doing is quitting as prime minister and taunting the Commons to find someone else to carry out its instruction. Deposing himself may turn out to be the most powerful card left in his hand.</p> \n<p>This was not in the original cunning plan when he arrived in Downing Street. The scheme did not envisage Mr Johnson having to hand in his cards to the Queen only weeks after becoming prime minister. If he ends up there, it will be the result of a series of miscalculations that have led to him losing control of Brexit, parliament and election timing in the space of less than a week.</p> \n<p>The first hubristic error was to announce the prorogation of parliament. Instead of greasing the wheels towards a no-deal Brexit, this provoked appeals to the courts and demonstrations outside Buckingham Palace. Most importantly, it galvanised opponents in the Commons. He managed the remarkable feat of uniting the Labour party not only with itself, but with other opposition parties. Having spent much of the summer engaged in dismal squabbling about how best to thwart a no-deal Brexit, they rallied around the standard of defending parliamentary rights against a dictatorial executive. They then made common cause with each other and Tory rebels to legislate against a crash-out Brexit.</p> \n<p>Making that vote a form of confidence issue was the next big misjudgment that backfired on the Johnson regime. Having made that nuclear threat, it had to be carried out, but the price has been huge. Stripping the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/what-have-tory-rebels-voted-for-and-will-an-election-now-happen\" title=\"\">21 rebels of the Tory whip</a> was the most brutal bloodletting in the party\u2019s modern history. The casualties of the purge include no less than seven former cabinet ministers, among them Ken Clarke, who served in the Heath, Thatcher, Major and Cameron governments. As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/ken-clarke-a-political-career-spanning-nearly-50-years\" title=\"\">Father of the House</a> points out in our interview with him in today\u2019s <em>Observer</em>, he first became an MP when Boris Johnson was \u201ca small toddler\u201d. Treating someone who has been a Conservative MP for nearly half a century as a traitor to Toryism shows just how far the party has become unanchored from its traditional principles. In anticipation that the Tory party will effectively run on a no-deal manifesto at the now looming election, a clutch of moderate Conservatives have since declared that they will not stand again, among them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/jo-johnson-quits-as-mp-and-minister-citing-national-interest\" title=\"\">the prime minister\u2019s younger brother, Jo</a>. That was the most personally wounding blow of the prime minister\u2019s catastrophe-strewn week.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d198604d9c3c9946f2e4ba1fc99ecfc34dfb83ab\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d198604d9c3c9946f2e4ba1fc99ecfc34dfb83ab/0_138_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MP Ken Clarke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MP Ken Clarke was among the casualties of the most brutal bloodletting in the Conservative party\u2019s modern history.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The worst miscalculation of the supposed grandmasters of political chess at Number 10 was to think they could then strike back by triggering an election on the prime minister\u2019s terms. The Johnson crew were convinced that an election was an offer the opposition could never refuse. After all, Labour facilitated an early election for Theresa May in 2017 even though she had a whopping poll lead at the time of the parliamentary vote to allow it and most Labour MPs thought it was going to mean a Tory landslide. So you can see why Number 10 believed this ploy had to work, but it turns out that there are still some people in the Labour party who can think a few moves ahead. Along with the other opposition parties, they decided to deny Mr Johnson an election timed for his convenience. Thus we have entered the looking-glass world in which a prime minister who wants to gamble the job he has only just acquired on an election is kettled inside Number 10 by Jeremy Corbyn.</p> \n<p>Tories hope, and some on Mr Corbyn\u2019s frontbench are nervous, that Labour will pay a price for appearing \u201cfrit\u201d. I am not sure about that. Past campaigns suggest that voters quickly forget how an election date came to be decided and concentrate instead on the choices before them.</p> \n<p>So the parliamentary tactics have exploded in his face, but this does not mean that his overall strategy is going to change. He has deepened the divisions in the Tory party. His chances of securing a refettled deal from the EU, never exactly high in the first place, look vanishingly slight. His scheme to force a snap election has been stymied. But like Macbeth, he is too stepped in blood to turn back now. He will double down on trying to frame the election battle as a choice between \u201cpeople and parliament\u201d, even if that means the sacrifice of more of his party\u2019s reputation with moderate voters.</p> \n<p>Will the expulsion of so many Tory MPs push more swing voters over to the Lib Dems? Highly likely. Will the Conservatives\u2019 electoral chances be diminished when the prime minister\u2019s own brother so little trusts him that he has sacrificed his parliamentary career? History suggests that the Tories will suffer for that. Is the metastasis of the Tories into a version of the Brexit party going to cost them seats, especially in Scotland, London and the south? This is very probable too. But then these were always going to be consequences of his \u201cdo or die\u201d, \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d, \u201ccome what may\u201d, \u201cshit or bust\u201d strategy. It is predicated on the assumption that his single most important task is to squeeze down the Brexit party \u2013 to \u201cput Farage back in his box\u201d, as he has said. Its overarching ambition is to recreate something resembling the coalition of voters that delivered the Leave outcome in the referendum in the hope that the British electoral system will translate that into a parliamentary majority for a hardcore Brexit.</p> \n<p>The electoral gamble is that the seats lost by the Tories will be more than compensated for by taking seats from Labour in Brexity areas currently represented by Labour MPs. The events of the past week have not so much changed the trajectory of the Tory party as accelerated it along the path it chose to take when it made him its leader.</p> \n<p>To have any chance of pulling off this massive gamble, he will have to retain credibility with pro-Brexit voters. Any hope of doing that would be shattered were he to go along to the EU and grovel, as Brexiters would see it, for another delay. Breaking the law would land him in the courts. Asking for an extension while protesting that he has been forced into it by parliament would look no better. In Brexiter eyes, that would turn him into a pathetic puppet prime minister.

      "bodyText": "Because Boris Johnson has such a notoriously casual relationship with the truth, there is a tendency not to take him seriously, even on the occasions when he is probably speaking with an unforked tongue. So there has been a lot of derision for his declaration that he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline. Seriously? Even if instructed to do so by the legislation that will be written into the statute book this week? Would he break the law, a ditch no previous occupant of his office has chosen to expire in? That, I think, is ultimately unlikely. He wouldn\u2019t like the food in prison. So might he resign as prime minister rather than carry out parliament\u2019s orders? Yes, I think he might do that. He would not want to quit. He may not have realised yet that the positions he has taken will compel him in that direction. But I think we may get to the point where resignation from Number 10, taking his government with him, ends up being his least worst option. He has been boxed by parliamentary votes that will not let him have a no-deal Brexit. He has been coxed by the opposition refusing him an election. The one thing they can\u2019t stop him doing is quitting as prime minister and taunting the Commons to find someone else to carry out its instruction. Deposing himself may turn out to be the most powerful card left in his hand. This was not in the original cunning plan when he arrived in Downing Street. The scheme did not envisage Mr Johnson having to hand in his cards to the Queen only weeks after becoming prime minister. If he ends up there, it will be the result of a series of miscalculations that have led to him losing control of Brexit, parliament and election timing in the space of less than a week. The first hubristic error was to announce the prorogation of parliament. Instead of greasing the wheels towards a no-deal Brexit, this provoked appeals to the courts and demonstrations outside Buckingham Palace. Most importantly, it galvanised opponents in the Commons. He managed the remarkable feat of uniting the Labour party not only with itself, but with other opposition parties. Having spent much of the summer engaged in dismal squabbling about how best to thwart a no-deal Brexit, they rallied around the standard of defending parliamentary rights against a dictatorial executive. They then made common cause with each other and Tory rebels to legislate against a crash-out Brexit. Making that vote a form of confidence issue was the next big misjudgment that backfired on the Johnson regime. Having made that nuclear threat, it had to be carried out, but the price has been huge. Stripping the 21 rebels of the Tory whip was the most brutal bloodletting in the party\u2019s modern history. The casualties of the purge include no less than seven former cabinet ministers, among them Ken Clarke, who served in the Heath, Thatcher, Major and Cameron governments. As the Father of the House points out in our interview with him in today\u2019s Observer, he first became an MP when Boris Johnson was \u201ca small toddler\u201d. Treating someone who has been a Conservative MP for nearly half a century as a traitor to Toryism shows just how far the party has become unanchored from its traditional principles. In anticipation that the Tory party will effectively run on a no-deal manifesto at the now looming election, a clutch of moderate Conservatives have since declared that they will not stand again, among them the prime minister\u2019s younger brother, Jo. That was the most personally wounding blow of the prime minister\u2019s catastrophe-strewn week. The worst miscalculation of the supposed grandmasters of political chess at Number 10 was to think they could then strike back by triggering an election on the prime minister\u2019s terms. The Johnson crew were convinced that an election was an offer the opposition could never refuse. After all, Labour facilitated an early election for Theresa May in 2017 even though she had a whopping poll lead at the time of the parliamentary vote to allow it and most Labour MPs thought it was going to mean a Tory landslide. So you can see why Number 10 believed this ploy had to work, but it turns out that there are still some people in the Labour party who can think a few moves ahead. Along with the other opposition parties, they decided to deny Mr Johnson an election timed for his convenience. Thus we have entered the looking-glass world in which a prime minister who wants to gamble the job he has only just acquired on an election is kettled inside Number 10 by Jeremy Corbyn. Tories hope, and some on Mr Corbyn\u2019s frontbench are nervous, that Labour will pay a price for appearing \u201cfrit\u201d. I am not sure about that. Past campaigns suggest that voters quickly forget how an election date came to be decided and concentrate instead on the choices before them. So the parliamentary tactics have exploded in his face, but this does not mean that his overall strategy is going to change. He has deepened the divisions in the Tory party. His chances of securing a refettled deal from the EU, never exactly high in the first place, look vanishingly slight. His scheme to force a snap election has been stymied. But like Macbeth, he is too stepped in blood to turn back now. He will double down on trying to frame the election battle as a choice between \u201cpeople and parliament\u201d, even if that means the sacrifice of more of his party\u2019s reputation with moderate voters. Will the expulsion of so many Tory MPs push more swing voters over to the Lib Dems? Highly likely. Will the Conservatives\u2019 electoral chances be diminished when the prime minister\u2019s own brother so little trusts him that he has sacrificed his parliamentary career? History suggests that the Tories will suffer for that. Is the metastasis of the Tories into a version of the Brexit party going to cost them seats, especially in Scotland, London and the south? This is very probable too. But then these were always going to be consequences of his \u201cdo or die\u201d, \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d, \u201ccome what may\u201d, \u201cshit or bust\u201d strategy. It is predicated on the assumption that his single most important task is to squeeze down the Brexit party \u2013 to \u201cput Farage back in his box\u201d, as he has said. Its overarching ambition is to recreate something resembling the coalition of voters that delivered the Leave outcome in the referendum in the hope that the British electoral system will translate that into a parliamentary majority for a hardcore Brexit. The electoral gamble is that the seats lost by the Tories will be more than compensated for by taking seats from Labour in Brexity areas currently represented by Labour MPs. The events of the past week have not so much changed the trajectory of the Tory party as accelerated it along the path it chose to take when it made him its leader. To have any chance of pulling off this massive gamble, he will have to retain credibility with pro-Brexit voters. Any hope of doing that would be shattered were he to go along to the EU and grovel, as Brexiters would see it, for another delay. Breaking the law would land him in the courts. Asking for an extension while protesting that he has been forced into it by parliament would look no better. In Brexiter eyes, that would turn him into a pathetic puppet prime minister. Though no one in the opposition parties is prepared to admit this in public, the boost this would give to the Brexit party at the expense of the Tories is one of the reasons the opposition wants to delay an election beyond the end of October. Allies report that Mr Johnson has privately said that he would rather resign than be the prime minister who asked for another postponement of Brexit. I think I believe that. Either Jeremy Corbyn or someone from the so-called Rebel Alliance would then have to take over in order to ask for the extension \u2013 after which the temporary unity between them would likely start to crack.

I know it sounds incredible, if not insane. And yet once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.

The station, whose acclaimed \u00a31bn remodelling by Grimshaw Architects has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/18/stirling-prize-2019-riba-shortlist-cork-building-social-housing\" title=\"\">shortlisted for the 2019 Stirling prize</a>, is airy and spacious, in spite of the crowds it must accommodate, and the ribbons of wood that cover the ceilings of its vast concourse give it a Scandinavian feel, at once modest and grand. It is like some 21st-century cathedral: a rush-hour temple that for all its circulatory efficiency is determined to remind the harried commuter that there is more to life than work; that a moment of contemplation is worth, if not a missed train, then at least a dozen emails.</p> <p>The new London Bridge is, to my eyes, Britain in microcosm; its history and its people. Its brick viaducts, for instance, speak of its Victorian beginnings \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.networkrail.co.uk/who-we-are/our-history/iconic-infrastructure/the-history-of-london-euston-station/\" title=\"\">the first station to be built in the capital</a>, it dates from 1836 \u2013 while Grimshaw\u2019s concrete arches subtly conjure postwar brutalism and the building boom of those years. There is an ineffable sense of confidence here, of a kind that many of us haven\u2019t much felt since 2012 and the Olympics. Western Arcade, which links the mainline station to the underground, is devoted to smart shops such as Kiehl\u2019s and the shirtmaker TM Lewin, as well as to a breed of cafe that sells \u2013 a sight new to me \u2013 \u201cred velvet croissants\u201d. But since last December it has also been home to a branch of the somewhat less elite Greggs, Britain\u2019s largest and best-value bakery chain, where a hungry traveller in search of a bargain can still pick up a bacon bap and a cup of coffee for just \u00a31.80.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The company is adept in social media \u2013 'a masterclass in public relations' said PR Week of its vegan sausage roll launch</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With Brexit looming, who knows how well Kiehl\u2019s will do at London Bridge \u2013 or even Pret a Manger and Leon? If, as seems almost certain, food becomes more expensive in Britain, and workers more worried about their jobs, people may soon be rather less inclined to spend their money on such quotidian luxuries as moisturising lotion, crayfish sandwiches and Moroccan meatballs. The crisis that currently afflicts the high street \u2013 shops closing, premises standing empty, major companies posting profit warnings \u2013 may not be strictly applicable to the busy realms of neatly designed transport hubs such as this one; in contrast to the decline of traditional stores, the so-called <a href=\"https://www.mca-insight.com/market-reports/uk-food-to-go-market-report-2019/576350.article\" title=\"\">food-to-go market is set to grow by \u00a32bn</a> over the next three years. Nevertheless, chill winds blow from every side. In the second quarter of this year, the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/09/uk-economy-contracts-on-back-of-brexit-uncertainty\" title=\"\">shrank by 0.2%</a>. Another contraction in the current quarter would signal a recession. Meanwhile, confidence ebbs away. Consumer confidence fell sharply in August. Last month, Lloyds Bank reported that businesses are <a href=\"https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/Media/Press-Releases/2016-press-releases/lloyds-bank/uk-business-confidence-falls-back-in-august/\" title=\"\">at their gloomiest since 2011</a>, when the UK was still recovering from the financial crash.</p> <p>If any business can defy this mood, it seems likely to be Greggs. But then it\u2019s already doing just that. In the six months to 29 June, <a href=\"https://www.conveniencestore.co.uk/greggs-reports-58-pre-tax-profits-rise-as-it-broadens-food-to-go-appeal/596113.article\" title=\"\">pretax profits at the company rose to </a><a href=\"https://www.conveniencestore.co.uk/greggs-reports-58-pre-tax-profits-rise-as-it-broadens-food-to-go-appeal/596113.article\" title=\"\">\u00a340.6m</a><a href=\"https://www.conveniencestore.co.uk/greggs-reports-58-pre-tax-profits-rise-as-it-broadens-food-to-go-appeal/596113.article\" title=\"\">, up from \u00a325.7m</a> in the same period last year, an amazing 58% rise in first-half profits, with sales up nearly 15% in total. When these figures were released, to a media fanfare that loudly contrasted such success with the misery elsewhere on the high street, its chief executive, Roger Whiteside, spoke of an \u201cexceptional year\u201d at the company, a period that began with the publicity attracted by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/14/greggs-vegan-sausage-rolls-fuel-profit-boom\" title=\"\">launch of its vegan sausage roll last January</a> (23% of those purchasing it were new customers \u2013 and once they were inside the store they couldn\u2019t resist buying other things too). </p> <p>That, however, is hardly the whole story. Greggs has been growing steadily for years now, a success story largely unnoticed by those who buy their breakfast at Starbucks, their lunch at Pret and who are very keen indeed on avocados (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/30/greggs-stores-to-open-late-in-effort-to-entice-dinner-shoppers\" title=\"\">Greggs, incidentally, now has a greater share of the UK coffee market than Starbucks</a>). It has had bad times, of course. Its worst year ever was 2013, when it found itself at a crossroads (we\u2019ll come back to that). Nevertheless, it remains one of very few British businesses with an unbroken record of dividend payments to its shareholders (the company was floated on the stock market in 1984).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GreggsOfficial/status/1095977195108028416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Two sausage rolls, both alike in dignity, In fair Greggs, where we lay our scene\u2026 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Valentines?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Valentines</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TJehdPNU7v\">pic.twitter.com/TJehdPNU7v</a></p>&mdash; Greggs (@GreggsOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreggsOfficial/status/1095977195108028416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 14, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The London Bridge branch isn\u2019t big and has no seating, but there are noticeably more customers queuing inside it than at any other store in the station and after a while I join them. I pick up a vegan sausage roll, which I will road test later, and a Portuguese custard tart (a new line in London branches) that looks just like the ones you buy in the overpriced deli near where I live, but at less than half the price. I also ask for a flat white and a bacon roll (the latter is made to order, with the sauce of your choice). The bill comes to \u00a35.10.</p> <p>Minutes later, I\u2019m outside again, sitting on a bench, people-watching, roof-gazing and eating: my own moment of contemplation. I consider myself an aficionado of bacon butties and this one is excellent: the white roll, smeared with ketchup, is soft with a good crumb and the bacon is crisp and not too salty. The coffee is also good, if a bit exiguous. This bap isn\u2019t the first thing I\u2019ve ever eaten from Greggs, but it is by some stretch the most delicious, though how much Grimshaw\u2019s soaring edifice has to do with this, I wouldn\u2019t like to say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75dab8a44816e95055cf894b2207b4c5e5584fe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75dab8a44816e95055cf894b2207b4c5e5584fe8/0_181_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greggs of Gosforth: the first Greggs store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greggs of Gosforth: the first Greggs store, which opened in 1951.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greggs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greggs began life in 1939, when a man called John Robson Gregg started selling eggs and yeast door to door on his bicycle around Newcastle upon Tyne. The first bakery, Greggs of Gosforth in Gosforth High Street, opened in 1951. Today, with some 2,000 shops and<a href=\"https://corporate.greggs.co.uk/sites/default/files/GREGGS%2021488%20AR2014%20Web.pdf\" title=\"\"> 20,000 employees</a>, its HQ is still in Newcastle, housed in an unprepossessing business park a 20-minute drive from the centre of the city. The company is well known for its publicity stunts and adept way with social media \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.prweek.com/article/1522045/hello-piers-weve-expecting-you-industry-pros-salivate-greggs-vegan-sausage-roll-pr-masterclass\" title=\"\">\u201ca masterclass in public relations\u201d, said </a><em><a href=\"https://www.prweek.com/article/1522045/hello-piers-weve-expecting-you-industry-pros-salivate-greggs-vegan-sausage-roll-pr-masterclass\" title=\"\">PR Week</a></em> of the launch of its vegan sausage roll \u2013 but when I ask to meet those who run it, there is a certain amount of what feels like foot-dragging. It seems that while the Greggs marketing team is relaxed about feeding stories to the <em>Sun</em> and the <em>Daily Mail</em>, it\u2019s rather less interested in giving the <em>Observer</em> access to its secrets, though I could be imagining this, given that it\u2019s also currently trying quite hard to change the way people see it. Perhaps I\u2019ve just caught them on the hop.</p> <p>In the end, however, a trip is arranged, which is how I come to be sitting in the test kitchen at Greggs\u2019 HQ one overcast morning with Kate Jones, its senior product development manager. It was Jones\u2019s team that developed the vegan sausage roll; the very item that Piers Morgan greeted on Twitter with the words: \u201cNobody was waiting for a vegan bloody sausage, you PC-ravaged clowns\u201d \u2013 cue the biggest social media storm ever to hit the world of baked goods (\u201cOh hello, Piers, we\u2019ve been expecting you,\u201d replied Greggs, smoothly). How quickly did they know it was a hit? (It\u2019s now a bestseller, though they won\u2019t give me numbers \u2013 on this or anything.) \u201cFrom day one,\u201d says Jones. \u201cWe got great coverage, there was Piers Morgan, and it snowballed from there.\u201d</p> <p>Did she have any doubts beforehand? \u201cIt was very challenging. Rolling a new product like this out is difficult because the whole supply chain has to be vegan: storage, transportation, how it\u2019s handled in the shops. It would have been easy to give up. But we knew there was a gap in the market for a hot vegan snacking product. A couple of years ago, we were working on a vegetarian sausage roll and it was almost ready for launch. It was, though, becoming very clear from customers that as more people are avoiding certain foods \u2013 like dairy, say \u2013 vegan products are becoming a proxy for flexitarian diets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GreggsOfficial/status/1151948525799968768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To address the confusion\u2026 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LoveIsland?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LoveIsland</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fwFkqbEcIP\">pic.twitter.com/fwFkqbEcIP</a></p>&mdash; Greggs (@GreggsOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreggsOfficial/status/1151948525799968768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The vegetarian sausage roll was ditched and the company began working instead on a vegan one. What\u2019s inside it? Jones smiles and looks coy. \u201cWe work with Quorn and then we add our <em>very secret </em>savoury flavouring.\u201d</p> <p>Jones, a home economist by training, began her career at M&amp;S, where she worked as a buyer for 16 years; later, she led food policy at the Co-op. Nevertheless, moving to Greggs represents a \u201cbig\u201d career change for her. \u201cI\u2019ve come out of retail and into food-to-go,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m also working in a company that is fully vertically integrated.\u201d I must look blank, because she adds: \u201cI mean one that makes virtually everything itself, rather than buying anything in.\u201d</p> <p>Her team develops all its products, first in this kitchen, in pots and pans, and then in the industrial stage (vats, rather than pans). An average Greggs store has about 150 food products. Her team creates 50 new ones each year, though this number includes items where only an ingredient has been changed or a sandwich filling tweaked. How many people taste something before it goes out? \u201cWe have a good 30 to 50 people who do factory trials as part of their jobs and then we hold panels with the wider Greggs population, people from finance or HR or wherever, who try them. We want people who are not necessarily dead close to the product, who haven\u2019t nursed it from conception, to say if they like it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c3a5dd28211aa51b531b31a212f95376f0080c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c3a5dd28211aa51b531b31a212f95376f0080c1/0_118_3550_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greggs\u2019s bestselling vegan sausage roll.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greggs\u2019s bestselling vegan sausage roll.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Fortune/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She takes me on a tour. First, we meet a baker, Fraser, who is icing new flavours of doughnuts that may \u2013 Jones is slightly reluctant to tell me \u2013 be launched next year: cookies and cream and honeycomb. Then we visit its sensory booths: compartments that bring to mind those cubicles you see in TV dramas in which a prisoner communicates with their visitor via a telephone through a screen. On one side of a divide someone from Jones\u2019s team pushes whatever is to be tasted through a hatch. On the other is the taster. The cubicles are tightly controlled in terms of heat and light and no taster is able to see the reaction of their colleagues. To avoid weariness, he or she only ever tries three products at a time.</p> <p>What are the areas of growth for Greggs? \u201cHealth,\u201d says Jones. The company anticipates more legislation around calorie reduction and believes it\u2019s already well ahead in its planning for this. What else? \u201cHot food \u2013 and coffee is huge.\u201d How would she sum up the company\u2019s ethos, food-wise? \u201cTaste and great value for money.\u201d</p> <p>Are perceptions of Greggs changing? It seems to me that if they are, then the success of its vegan sausage roll is emblematic of such a shift. But what does she think? Are people still snobbish about it? Do they still think that it only sells greasy, stodgy foods to those who want, and need, to fill up quickly for very little cost?</p> <p>\u201cTwo years ago, I might have said yes,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019d have looked at my mother and taken her as absolute proof of that. But now it\u2019s becoming quite savvy to get it \u2013 to know about our quality.\u201d This moment reminds her, she says, of when discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl came along. \u201cThere were Waitrose shoppers who suddenly realised they could get great commodities at Aldi.\u201d I remember this too. \u201cJust <em>guess</em> where this smoked salmon came from!\u201d shouted the broke middle classes, as if with one voice. But are the two things really the same? She nods. \u201cPeople are genuinely delighted when they explore the range of our products.\u201d</p> <p>As I listen to her, I take her words with a fairly hefty pinch of salt. A few weeks later, however, I will open a magazine and there will be Nicky Haslam, the old Etonian society decorator who once claimed to have had an affair with Lord Snowdon, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/my-london-nicky-haslam-a4222466.html\" title=\"\">proudly insisting that Greggs\u2019 coffee is \u201cthe best\u201d</a>.</p> <p>In the hope of bringing new customers \u2013 and a new <em>kind</em> of customer \u2013 to Greggs, the company has deployed a number of stunts. Some are cheesy. A Valentine\u2019s Day promotion offered \u201cfine dining\u201d in stores, where waiters dressed in black tie served guests mini doughnuts in chocolate dipping sauce. Others are nifty and smart. Last year, for instance, it attended a food festival in Richmond, Surrey, where it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tibTtj5vY1Y\" title=\"\">offered visitors its wares under the name Gregory &amp; Gregory</a>. When the sign was turned around to reveal the word Greggs, people could, says Hannah Squirrel, the company\u2019s marketing director, \u201chardly believe it\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tibTtj5vY1Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tibTtj5vY1Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tibTtj5vY1Y\">Greggs at the Richmond food festival.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Others are downright cheeky. There is a branch of Greggs opposite Fenwick of Newcastle, the Harrods of the north. Last year, just as Fenwick\u2019s Christmas windows were revealed to the public, a display that usually attracts a crowd, the company flipped the Greggs sign so that it would no longer be back to front when reflected in the glass. News of this coup is said to have travelled as far as Australia. Its missteps are rare, though there was an outcry in 2017 when it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/15/greggs-nativity-jesus-sausage-roll-advent-calendar\" title=\"\">replaced Jesus with a sausage roll in a nativity scene</a> (the company soon apologised).</p> <p>But it is a balancing act. Loyal, older customers \u2013 the kind of people, perhaps, who caused a selection of sausage roll-covered socks, umbrellas and iPhone cases to sell out at Greggs on the first day they became available \u2013 must be kept on side, too, for they are the majority and still the biggest key to its success. To that end some stores continue to stock regional items, available only in certain parts of the UK (stotties in the north-east, Empire biscuits in Scotland, Tottenham cakes in London; there are reputed to be 25 such delicacies). For these customers, service is extremely important.</p> <p>\u201cPeople will tell us proactively that they left the shop with a smile on their face,\u201d says Squirrel. \u201cThere was banter, it was down to earth. Some people say that our staff have been known to begin making up their usual order even before they\u2019ve stepped in the door. They\u2019re regulars, they\u2019re recognised, and they like that.\u201d Are its northern roots still relevant? \u201cYes. Because it has never lost sight of its original values.\u201d This filters down, she believes. It feels, she says, caring and warm.</p> <p>Greggs began acquiring other bakeries in 1972, first in Glasgow and Leeds, and then in Manchester, London, Kent and East Anglia (by this time, John Gregg had died and his son, Ian, a lawyer who read classics at Cambridge, was running the business; he is now a philanthropist). In 1994, it acquired Bakers Oven, a chain of bakeries in the south, shops that it rebranded as Greggs in 2008. The 1,500th store, in York, opened in 2011.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No one leaves the house looking for a Greggs. They leave the house and then they feel hungry.</p> <footer> <cite>Roger Whiteside, CEO</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his 2013 book, <em>Bread</em> \u2013 a memoir-cum-business-manual that includes recipes for bridies, parkin and bread cakes (otherwise known as white rolls) \u2013 Ian Gregg describes his great joy and sense of relief when, on its flotation in April 1984, the company\u2019s shares were oversubscribed by a factor of 90. But he also writes \u2013 he was always something of a reluctant entrepreneur \u2013 of the anxiety he felt. He worried about its \u201cculture\u201d; that its \u201cvalues\u201d might not be maintained. Three years later, in 1987, he established the <a href=\"https://www.greggsfoundation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Greggs Foundation</a>. So far this year, it has provided 6.6m breakfasts to children in underprivileged communities.</p> <p>Roger Whiteside became chief executive in 2013, having first joined the company as a nonexecutive director. (After university in Leeds, he began his career at M&amp;S; he then launched Ocado, worked for a private equity firm on the Thresher Group and put in a stint at Punch Taverns.) Whiteside is the kind of enthusiastic, plain-speaking leader you hear on Evan Davies\u2019s Radio 4 business programme, <em>The Bottom Line</em><em> </em>(he recently appeared on the <a href=\"http://www.maryportas.com/podcast\" title=\"\">podcast of </a><a href=\"http://www.maryportas.com/podcast\" title=\"\">retail guru Mary Portas</a>). It comes as no surprise when he chooses to meet me for lunch in the branch of Greggs nearest his office (when I say near, what I mean is that if he chucked a hot steak bake out of his window, it would land outside the shop\u2019s door). I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that, at this point, I\u2019ve never eaten in Greggs. But this doesn\u2019t bother him at all. It\u2019s perfect. Another convert! \u201cHave a sausage roll,\u201d he says. Is that what he\u2019s having? \u201cNo, I\u2019ve already had one this week.\u201d He will have a chicken caesar wrap.</p> <p>When Whiteside joined the company he immediately liked what he saw: \u201cBusinesses operate on a moral compass and Greggs is at the nice end of that compass, as opposed to the purely hard-nosed end. I prefer this end: trying to do business in as good a way as you can, given that there is always tension between trying to make a profit and behaving well.\u201d</p> <p>In particular, he liked the profit share scheme, which he believes contributes \u201cmassively\u201d to the atmosphere at the company and to its success (10% of its profits are shared with every member of staff, so long as they have been at the company for a year). \u201cWe look after our people and they respond by giving better service,\u201d he says. How does he know this? \u201cWe do rigorous engagement surveys and the scores are always high. And remember when we had snow? A Greggs lorry got stuck and the driver took it upon himself, knowing he was not going to get to the shop, to distribute his goods, free, to those behind him. He didn\u2019t ask for permission, because he didn\u2019t need to.\u201d Did this please him? \u201cI was over the moon!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61306b785448532f789215b9cf9a0eaef0928964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61306b785448532f789215b9cf9a0eaef0928964/0_302_2201_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Greggs delivery driver hands out free cakes and pastries to snowed-in drivers in March last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Greggs delivery driver hands out free cakes and pastries to snowed-in drivers in March last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Les Goff/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All the same, in 2013, he had his work cut out. \u201cGreggs\u2019 worst year ever. It was losing market share in bakery, where it had been competing with supermarkets for decades. To compensate for that it had been developing a presence in food-on-the-go, but it was also losing share there too, because there were so many new entrants to that sector: Costa, Subway, Tesco Express, M&amp;S Simply Food\u2026 We also had a coffee shop concept.\u201d</p> <p>Whiteside decided that the company could not compete on three separate fronts and that it would henceforth concentrate on food-on-the-go. Its \u201coffer\u201d was completely revamped, with more focus on the growing breakfast market as well as on healthier and hot foods, its stores were refitted and, to support all this, its 12 factories were consolidated, with those remaining concentrating on the manufacture of just one item. (Its cream cakes are now all made in Leeds, for instance, and its rolls in Enfield.).</p> <p>Meanwhile, Whiteside pondered Greggs\u2019 locations. People like Greggs, he believes, for the freshness of its goods; the supermarkets sell a wider selection of sandwiches at similar prices, but unlike Greggs, theirs are made in factories and kept for two or three days (Greggs makes its sandwiches in store and they are not kept overnight). However, there is also the question of convenience. \u201cNo one leaves the house looking for a Greggs,\u201d he says, with some honesty. \u201cThey leave the house and <em>then</em> they feel hungry.\u201d Where are they likely to be when this raging hunger strikes? With footfall on the high street in decline, Greggs began opening branches in office parks, on garage forecourts and other out-of-town places.</p> <p>\u201cWe open 150 shops each year and 90% of those will be non-high street and we close 50 every year, and those are all high street. In the past six years, we have closed 300 high street shops, but we have opened a lot more elsewhere.\u201d Opening hours are being extended in some stores in the hope of luring in evening diners. As Whiteside boasted this summer, \u201cWe want to try and do the same for evening as we did in breakfast.\u201d</p> <p> In the next five years, the company will open 100 stores every year, in the process creating 1,000 new jobs every year. And after that? \u201cEach of our shops currently has only one queue: the walk-in queue. We want to build three: we want to add click and collect and delivery, both of which we\u2019re trialling.\u201d Does he visit his stores incognito? \u201cI don\u2019t announce myself. But in today\u2019s video age, a lot of people recognise me. With ears like this \u2013\u201d he points to the sides of his head \u2013 \u201cI haven\u2019t got a chance! I\u2019d need a toupee and Sellotape.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GreggsOfficial/status/1080527865467322369\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh hello Piers, we&#39;ve been expecting you</p>&mdash; Greggs (@GreggsOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreggsOfficial/status/1080527865467322369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 2, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Perceptions of Greggs are changing, he says. People like me \u2013 a wide smile \u2013 have outdated views about it. However, this takes careful management. When the company ceased to be a traditional baker, people were upset. \u201cI\u2019ve got a drawer full of letters from customers who were angry they could no longer buy their loaf. The customer is always right, but you have to say to those who are hanging on to the past that you are not there for them any more.\u201d</p> <p>How posh would the company go? \u201cWe\u2019re not posh now.\u201d Would he put, say, hummus on the menu? \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do things that have limited appeal. We democratise things that have a <em>growing</em> appeal. We will sometimes take things we see in London, like the flat white. Other things we\u2019ve tried [to copy] only have appeal in London, like protein pots. Two boiled eggs on a bed of spinach. Even at half the price, no one wanted it.\u201d</p> <p>As Whiteside talks \u2013 at moments, he is unstoppable \u2013 I think about Greggs and its long history. Its metamorphosis says so much about British eating habits and all the ways in which they\u2019ve changed (and, equally, not changed at all \u2013 for don\u2019t we still crave pastry, even if it is free of animal fats?). The company has reached its zenith, moreover, at the same time as the major political event and potential catastrophe that is Brexit. Its Britishness, its success, and this historical moment appear, in some way, to be linked, though it\u2019s hard to pin this down precisely. Does Greggs have a position on Brexit? \u201cNo,\u201d says Whiteside. \u201cIt\u2019s too divisive. Our customers are split. We\u2019re not going to take sides.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Britain\u2019s leading purveyor of Empire biscuits (two rounds of shortbread stuck together with jam), emphatically does not support a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. If there is disruption at the port\u2026 We might go short of salad. We don\u2019t grow enough here and you can\u2019t store it. What if we\u2019ve got no lettuce? Can we still make a sandwich without it? Would spinach be an acceptable replacement? Or would we have to discontinue certain sandwiches?\u201d</p> <p>He looks at his chicken caesar wrap as if it contains half the mysteries of the world.</p> <h2>The view from the counter: customers\u2019 verdict on Greggs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cccf8fd7367f6c06b161140b3f400c47a805e9e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cccf8fd7367f6c06b161140b3f400c47a805e9e3/0_467_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kshitij Patel outside the Great Portland Street branch of Greggs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kshitij Patel outside the Great Portland Street branch of Greggs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anita Sethi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kshitij Patel, 53, IT engineer (Great Portland Street branch, London)</strong><br>It\u2019s a good price \u2013 elsewhere in central London the prices are bonkers. I\u2019m from Luton but I commute to Soho to work and stop by here especially. It\u2019s quick service and great for vegetarians. Since they brought in the vegan roll it\u2019s been fantastic. Occasionally, I get the tuna bake. I\u2019m a regular here but it\u2019s not my daily routine \u2013 it would be too fattening to come every day! It\u2019s my treat for the week. Today, I\u2019ll be having two vegan rolls.</p> <p><strong>Jay Reed, 44, Builder (Great Portland Street branch, London)</strong><br>I love the fact that the price is good and the food tastes great. I work just around the corner. I\u2019m a builder and a regular here. I love the breakfast \u2013 bacon baguettes, sausage rolls and steak bakes are my favourites. We\u2019re back at lunchtime too for one of their sandwiches. Whenever I see a Greggs I pop in and get something \u2013 I can\u2019t resist.</p> <p><strong>Fiona Mayle, 62, works at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Westminster branch, London)</strong><br>Greggs increases my wellbeing in the morning. I live in E13 but work at the FCO. I love that the service is very quick and also the excellent meal deals, which I often get \u2013 a roll with sausage or bacon and a coffee. Today, I will have a lovely sausage roll with tomato sauce \u2013 a great start to the day.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Koumis, 30, analyst (Westminster branch, London)</strong><br>Their sausage rolls are my absolute favourite and great value for money. I\u2019ve been coming to Greggs regularly since this branch opened [last year]. Several of my colleagues and friends also come \u2013 it\u2019s so good to have a branch in the area.</p> <p><strong>Sheena Mal, 29, commerce consultant (Westminster branch, London)</strong><br>I love Greggs \u2013 it\u2019s affordable and tasty. The pasties and the breakfasts are fantastic. Today, I\u2019m having the creamy porridge. I\u2019ve been going to Greggs for years, including the one in the area where I grew up in west London. There\u2019s always something I like and often something new on the menu.</p> <p><strong>Eleanor Lisney, 60, disability campaigner (Westminster branch, London)</strong><br>I live in Greenwich but I\u2019m here for a meeting. It\u2019s great to find Greggs here. I come for the vegan food. I love the vegan rolls. I\u2019m a wheelchair user and in terms of accessibility restaurants are variable but I\u2019ve never found any Greggs inaccessible. It\u2019s good to find a branch at the actual tube station.</p> <p><strong>Prav Gupta, 35; Steve Agate, 45; Masoud Bayat, 42, IT consultants (Westminster branch, London)</strong><br>We\u2019re colleagues and often come here together \u2013 we love how the smell hits you when you get off the escalator first thing in the morning. The breakfasts really set us up for the day, including the omelette and sausage rolls, and nothing beats a good coffee from Greggs to get the day started.</p> <p><strong>Aamna Mohdin, 27, news reporter (Westminster branch, London)</strong><br>I love how cheap it is.

      "bodyText": "One morning towards the end of summer I pay a visit to London Bridge station. The day is warm and sunny and, in spite of the news, which is as unrelentingly grim as ever, I feel suddenly hopeful; optimism rising inside me like mercury in a thermometer. The station, whose acclaimed \u00a31bn remodelling by Grimshaw Architects has been shortlisted for the 2019 Stirling prize, is airy and spacious, in spite of the crowds it must accommodate, and the ribbons of wood that cover the ceilings of its vast concourse give it a Scandinavian feel, at once modest and grand. It is like some 21st-century cathedral: a rush-hour temple that for all its circulatory efficiency is determined to remind the harried commuter that there is more to life than work; that a moment of contemplation is worth, if not a missed train, then at least a dozen emails. The new London Bridge is, to my eyes, Britain in microcosm; its history and its people. Its brick viaducts, for instance, speak of its Victorian beginnings \u2013 the first station to be built in the capital, it dates from 1836 \u2013 while Grimshaw\u2019s concrete arches subtly conjure postwar brutalism and the building boom of those years. There is an ineffable sense of confidence here, of a kind that many of us haven\u2019t much felt since 2012 and the Olympics. Western Arcade, which links the mainline station to the underground, is devoted to smart shops such as Kiehl\u2019s and the shirtmaker TM Lewin, as well as to a breed of cafe that sells \u2013 a sight new to me \u2013 \u201cred velvet croissants\u201d. But since last December it has also been home to a branch of the somewhat less elite Greggs, Britain\u2019s largest and best-value bakery chain, where a hungry traveller in search of a bargain can still pick up a bacon bap and a cup of coffee for just \u00a31.80. With Brexit looming, who knows how well Kiehl\u2019s will do at London Bridge \u2013 or even Pret a Manger and Leon? If, as seems almost certain, food becomes more expensive in Britain, and workers more worried about their jobs, people may soon be rather less inclined to spend their money on such quotidian luxuries as moisturising lotion, crayfish sandwiches and Moroccan meatballs. The crisis that currently afflicts the high street \u2013 shops closing, premises standing empty, major companies posting profit warnings \u2013 may not be strictly applicable to the busy realms of neatly designed transport hubs such as this one; in contrast to the decline of traditional stores, the so-called food-to-go market is set to grow by \u00a32bn over the next three years. Nevertheless, chill winds blow from every side. In the second quarter of this year, the economy shrank by 0.2%. Another contraction in the current quarter would signal a recession. Meanwhile, confidence ebbs away. Consumer confidence fell sharply in August. Last month, Lloyds Bank reported that businesses are at their gloomiest since 2011, when the UK was still recovering from the financial crash. If any business can defy this mood, it seems likely to be Greggs. But then it\u2019s already doing just that. In the six months to 29 June, pretax profits at the company rose to \u00a340.6m, up from \u00a325.7m in the same period last year, an amazing 58% rise in first-half profits, with sales up nearly 15% in total. When these figures were released, to a media fanfare that loudly contrasted such success with the misery elsewhere on the high street, its chief executive, Roger Whiteside, spoke of an \u201cexceptional year\u201d at the company, a period that began with the publicity attracted by the launch of its vegan sausage roll last January (23% of those purchasing it were new customers \u2013 and once they were inside the store they couldn\u2019t resist buying other things too). That, however, is hardly the whole story. Greggs has been growing steadily for years now, a success story largely unnoticed by those who buy their breakfast at Starbucks, their lunch at Pret and who are very keen indeed on avocados (Greggs, incidentally, now has a greater share of the UK coffee market than Starbucks). It has had bad times, of course. Its worst year ever was 2013, when it found itself at a crossroads (we\u2019ll come back to that). Nevertheless, it remains one of very few British businesses with an unbroken record of dividend payments to its shareholders (the company was floated on the stock market in 1984). The London Bridge branch isn\u2019t big and has no seating, but there are noticeably more customers queuing inside it than at any other store in the station and after a while I join them. I pick up a vegan sausage roll, which I will road test later, and a Portuguese custard tart (a new line in London branches) that looks just like the ones you buy in the overpriced deli near where I live, but at less than half the price. I also ask for a flat white and a bacon roll (the latter is made to order, with the sauce of your choice). The bill comes to \u00a35.10. Minutes later, I\u2019m outside again, sitting on a bench, people-watching, roof-gazing and eating: my own moment of contemplation. I consider myself an aficionado of bacon butties and this one is excellent: the white roll, smeared with ketchup, is soft with a good crumb and the bacon is crisp and not too salty. The coffee is also good, if a bit exiguous. This bap isn\u2019t the first thing I\u2019ve ever eaten from Greggs, but it is by some stretch the most delicious, though how much Grimshaw\u2019s soaring edifice has to do with this, I wouldn\u2019t like to say. Greggs began life in 1939, when a man called John Robson Gregg started selling eggs and yeast door to door on his bicycle around Newcastle upon Tyne. The first bakery, Greggs of Gosforth in Gosforth High Street, opened in 1951. Today, with some 2,000 shops and 20,000 employees, its HQ is still in Newcastle, housed in an unprepossessing business park a 20-minute drive from the centre of the city. The company is well known for its publicity stunts and adept way with social media \u2013 \u201ca masterclass in public relations\u201d, said PR Week of the launch of its vegan sausage roll \u2013 but when I ask to meet those who run it, there is a certain amount of what feels like foot-dragging. It seems that while the Greggs marketing team is relaxed about feeding stories to the Sun and the Daily Mail, it\u2019s rather less interested in giving the Observer access to its secrets, though I could be imagining this, given that it\u2019s also currently trying quite hard to change the way people see it. Perhaps I\u2019ve just caught them on the hop. In the end, however, a trip is arranged, which is how I come to be sitting in the test kitchen at Greggs\u2019 HQ one overcast morning with Kate Jones, its senior product development manager. It was Jones\u2019s team that developed the vegan sausage roll; the very item that Piers Morgan greeted on Twitter with the words: \u201cNobody was waiting for a vegan bloody sausage, you PC-ravaged clowns\u201d \u2013 cue the biggest social media storm ever to hit the world of baked goods (\u201cOh hello, Piers, we\u2019ve been expecting you,\u201d replied Greggs, smoothly). How quickly did they know it was a hit? (It\u2019s now a bestseller, though they won\u2019t give me numbers \u2013 on this or anything.) \u201cFrom day one,\u201d says Jones. \u201cWe got great coverage, there was Piers Morgan, and it snowballed from there.\u201d Did she have any doubts beforehand? \u201cIt was very challenging. Rolling a new product like this out is difficult because the whole supply chain has to be vegan: storage, transportation, how it\u2019s handled in the shops. It would have been easy to give up. But we knew there was a gap in the market for a hot vegan snacking product. A couple of years ago, we were working on a vegetarian sausage roll and it was almost ready for launch. It was, though, becoming very clear from customers that as more people are avoiding certain foods \u2013 like dairy, say \u2013 vegan products are becoming a proxy for flexitarian diets.\u201d The vegetarian sausage roll was ditched and the company began working instead on a vegan one. What\u2019s inside it? Jones smiles and looks coy. \u201cWe work with Quorn and then we add our very secret savoury flavouring.\u201d Jones, a home economist by training, began her career at M&amp;S, where she worked as a buyer for 16 years; later, she led food policy at the Co-op. Nevertheless, moving to Greggs represents a \u201cbig\u201d career change for her. \u201cI\u2019ve come out of retail and into food-to-go,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m also working in a company that is fully vertically integrated.\u201d I must look blank, because she adds: \u201cI mean one that makes virtually everything itself, rather than buying anything in.\u201d Her team develops all its products, first in this kitchen, in pots and pans, and then in the industrial stage (vats, rather than pans). An average Greggs store has about 150 food products. Her team creates 50 new ones each year, though this number includes items where only an ingredient has been changed or a sandwich filling tweaked. How many people taste something before it goes out? \u201cWe have a good 30 to 50 people who do factory trials as part of their jobs and then we hold panels with the wider Greggs population, people from finance or HR or wherever, who try them. We want people who are not necessarily dead close to the product, who haven\u2019t nursed it from conception, to say if they like it.\u201d She takes me on a tour. First, we meet a baker, Fraser, who is icing new flavours of doughnuts that may \u2013 Jones is slightly reluctant to tell me \u2013 be launched next year: cookies and cream and honeycomb. Then we visit its sensory booths: compartments that bring to mind those cubicles you see in TV dramas in which a prisoner communicates with their visitor via a telephone through a screen. On one side of a divide someone from Jones\u2019s team pushes whatever is to be tasted through a hatch. On the other is the taster. The cubicles are tightly controlled in terms of heat and light and no taster is able to see the reaction of their colleagues. To avoid weariness, he or she only ever tries three products at a time. What are the areas of growth for Greggs? \u201cHealth,\u201d says Jones. The company anticipates more legislation around calorie reduction and believes it\u2019s already well ahead in its planning for this. What else? \u201cHot food \u2013 and coffee is huge.\u201d How would she sum up the company\u2019s ethos, food-wise? \u201cTaste and great value for money.\u201d Are perceptions of Greggs changing? It seems to me that if they are, then the success of its vegan sausage roll is emblematic of such a shift. But what does she think? Are people still snobbish about it? Do they still think that it only sells greasy, stodgy foods to those who want, and need, to fill up quickly for very little cost? \u201cTwo years ago, I might have said yes,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019d have looked at my mother and taken her as absolute proof of that. But now it\u2019s becoming quite savvy to get it \u2013 to know about our quality.\u201d This moment reminds her, she says, of when discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl came along. \u201cThere were Waitrose shoppers who suddenly realised they could get great commodities at Aldi.\u201d I remember this too. \u201cJust guess where this smoked salmon came from!\u201d shouted the broke middle classes, as if with one voice. But are the two things really the same? She nods. \u201cPeople are genuinely delighted when they explore the range of our products.\u201d As I listen to her, I take her words with a fairly hefty pinch of salt. A few weeks later, however, I will open a magazine and there will be Nicky Haslam, the old Etonian society decorator who once claimed to have had an affair with Lord Snowdon, proudly insisting that Greggs\u2019 coffee is \u201cthe best\u201d. In the hope of bringing new customers \u2013 and a new kind of customer \u2013 to Greggs, the company has deployed a number of stunts. Some are cheesy. A Valentine\u2019s Day promotion offered \u201cfine dining\u201d in stores, where waiters dressed in black tie served guests mini doughnuts in chocolate dipping sauce. Others are nifty and smart. Last year, for instance, it attended a food festival in Richmond, Surrey, where it offered visitors its wares under the name Gregory &amp; Gregory. When the sign was turned around to reveal the word Greggs, people could, says Hannah Squirrel, the company\u2019s marketing director, \u201chardly believe it\u201d. Others are downright cheeky. There is a branch of Greggs opposite Fenwick of Newcastle, the Harrods of the north. Last year, just as Fenwick\u2019s Christmas windows were revealed to the public, a display that usually attracts a crowd, the company flipped the Greggs sign so that it would no longer be back to front when reflected in the glass. News of this coup is said to have travelled as far as Australia. Its missteps are rare, though there was an outcry in 2017 when it replaced Jesus with a sausage roll in a nativity scene (the company soon apologised). But it is a balancing act. Loyal, older customers \u2013 the kind of people, perhaps, who caused a selection of sausage roll-covered socks, umbrellas and iPhone cases to sell out at Greggs on the first day they became available \u2013 must be kept on side, too, for they are the majority and still the biggest key to its success. To that end some stores continue to stock regional items, available only in certain parts of the UK (stotties in the north-east, Empire biscuits in Scotland, Tottenham cakes in London; there are reputed to be 25 such delicacies). For these customers, service is extremely important. \u201cPeople will tell us proactively that they left the shop with a smile on their face,\u201d says Squirrel. \u201cThere was banter, it was down to earth. Some people say that our staff have been known to begin making up their usual order even before they\u2019ve stepped in the door. They\u2019re regulars, they\u2019re recognised, and they like that.\u201d Are its northern roots still relevant? \u201cYes. Because it has never lost sight of its original values.\u201d This filters down, she believes. It feels, she says, caring and warm. Greggs began acquiring other bakeries in 1972, first in Glasgow and Leeds, and then in Manchester, London, Kent and East Anglia (by this time, John Gregg had died and his son, Ian, a lawyer who read classics at Cambridge, was running the business; he is now a philanthropist). In 1994, it acquired Bakers Oven, a chain of bakeries in the south, shops that it rebranded as Greggs in 2008. The 1,500th store, in York, opened in 2011. In his 2013 book, Bread \u2013 a memoir-cum-business-manual that includes recipes for bridies, parkin and bread cakes (otherwise known as white rolls) \u2013 Ian Gregg describes his great joy and sense of relief when, on its flotation in April 1984, the company\u2019s shares were oversubscribed by a factor of 90. But he also writes \u2013 he was always something of a reluctant entrepreneur \u2013 of the anxiety he felt. He worried about its \u201cculture\u201d; that its \u201cvalues\u201d might not be maintained. Three years later, in 1987, he established the Greggs Foundation. So far this year, it has provided 6.6m breakfasts to children in underprivileged communities. Roger Whiteside became chief executive in 2013, having first joined the company as a nonexecutive director. (After university in Leeds, he began his career at M&amp;S; he then launched Ocado, worked for a private equity firm on the Thresher Group and put in a stint at Punch Taverns.) Whiteside is the kind of enthusiastic, plain-speaking leader you hear on Evan Davies\u2019s Radio 4 business programme, The Bottom Line (he recently appeared on the podcast of retail guru Mary Portas). It comes as no surprise when he chooses to meet me for lunch in the branch of Greggs nearest his office (when I say near, what I mean is that if he chucked a hot steak bake out of his window, it would land outside the shop\u2019s door). I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that, at this point, I\u2019ve never eaten in Greggs. But this doesn\u2019t bother him at all. It\u2019s perfect. Another convert! \u201cHave a sausage roll,\u201d he says. Is that what he\u2019s having? \u201cNo, I\u2019ve already had one this week.\u201d He will have a chicken caesar wrap. When Whiteside joined the company he immediately liked what he saw: \u201cBusinesses operate on a moral compass and Greggs is at the nice end of that compass, as opposed to the purely hard-nosed end. I prefer this end: trying to do business in as good a way as you can, given that there is always tension between trying to make a profit and behaving well.\u201d In particular, he liked the profit share scheme, which he believes contributes \u201cmassively\u201d to the atmosphere at the company and to its success (10% of its profits are shared with every member of staff, so long as they have been at the company for a year). \u201cWe look after our people and they respond by giving better service,\u201d he says. How does he know this? \u201cWe do rigorous engagement surveys and the scores are always high. And remember when we had snow? A Greggs lorry got stuck and the driver took it upon himself, knowing he was not going to get to the shop, to distribute his goods, free, to those behind him. He didn\u2019t ask for permission, because he didn\u2019t need to.\u201d Did this please him? \u201cI was over the moon!\u201d All the same, in 2013, he had his work cut out. \u201cGreggs\u2019 worst year ever. It was losing market share in bakery, where it had been competing with supermarkets for decades. To compensate for that it had been developing a presence in food-on-the-go, but it was also losing share there too, because there were so many new entrants to that sector: Costa, Subway, Tesco Express, M&amp;S Simply Food\u2026 We also had a coffee shop concept.\u201d Whiteside decided that the company could not compete on three separate fronts and that it would henceforth concentrate on food-on-the-go. Its \u201coffer\u201d was completely revamped, with more focus on the growing breakfast market as well as on healthier and hot foods, its stores were refitted and, to support all this, its 12 factories were consolidated, with those remaining concentrating on the manufacture of just one item. (Its cream cakes are now all made in Leeds, for instance, and its rolls in Enfield.). Meanwhile, Whiteside pondered Greggs\u2019 locations. People like Greggs, he believes, for the freshness of its goods; the supermarkets sell a wider selection of sandwiches at similar prices, but unlike Greggs, theirs are made in factories and kept for two or three days (Greggs makes its sandwiches in store and they are not kept overnight). However, there is also the question of convenience. \u201cNo one leaves the house looking for a Greggs,\u201d he says, with some honesty. \u201cThey leave the house and then they feel hungry.\u201d Where are they likely to be when this raging hunger strikes? With footfall on the high street in decline, Greggs began opening branches in office parks, on garage forecourts and other out-of-town places. \u201cWe open 150 shops each year and 90% of those will be non-high street and we close 50 every year, and those are all high street. In the past six years, we have closed 300 high street shops, but we have opened a lot more elsewhere.\u201d Opening hours are being extended in some stores in the hope of luring in evening diners. As Whiteside boasted this summer, \u201cWe want to try and do the same for evening as we did in breakfast.\u201d In the next five years, the company will open 100 stores every year, in the process creating 1,000 new jobs every year. And after that? \u201cEach of our shops currently has only one queue: the walk-in queue. We want to build three: we want to add click and collect and delivery, both of which we\u2019re trialling.\u201d Does he visit his stores incognito? \u201cI don\u2019t announce myself. But in today\u2019s video age, a lot of people recognise me. With ears like this \u2013\u201d he points to the sides of his head \u2013 \u201cI haven\u2019t got a chance! I\u2019d need a toupee and Sellotape.\u201d Perceptions of Greggs are changing, he says. People like me \u2013 a wide smile \u2013 have outdated views about it. However, this takes careful management. When the company ceased to be a traditional baker, people were upset. \u201cI\u2019ve got a drawer full of letters from customers who were angry they could no longer buy their loaf. The customer is always right, but you have to say to those who are hanging on to the past that you are not there for them any more.\u201d How posh would the company go? \u201cWe\u2019re not posh now.\u201d Would he put, say, hummus on the menu? \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do things that have limited appeal. We democratise things that have a growing appeal. We will sometimes take things we see in London, like the flat white. Other things we\u2019ve tried [to copy] only have appeal in London, like protein pots. Two boiled eggs on a bed of spinach. Even at half the price, no one wanted it.\u201d As Whiteside talks \u2013 at moments, he is unstoppable \u2013 I think about Greggs and its long history. Its metamorphosis says so much about British eating habits and all the ways in which they\u2019ve changed (and, equally, not changed at all \u2013 for don\u2019t we still crave pastry, even if it is free of animal fats?). The company has reached its zenith, moreover, at the same time as the major political event and potential catastrophe that is Brexit. Its Britishness, its success, and this historical moment appear, in some way, to be linked, though it\u2019s hard to pin this down precisely. Does Greggs have a position on Brexit? \u201cNo,\u201d says Whiteside. \u201cIt\u2019s too divisive. Our customers are split. We\u2019re not going to take sides.\u201d Nevertheless, Britain\u2019s leading purveyor of Empire biscuits (two rounds of shortbread stuck together with jam), emphatically does not support a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. If there is disruption at the port\u2026 We might go short of salad. We don\u2019t grow enough here and you can\u2019t store it. What if we\u2019ve got no lettuce? Can we still make a sandwich without it? Would spinach be an acceptable replacement? Or would we have to discontinue certain sandwiches?\u201d He looks at his chicken caesar wrap as if it contains half the mysteries of the world. The view from the counter: customers\u2019 verdict on Greggs Kshitij Patel, 53, IT engineer (Great Portland Street branch, London) It\u2019s a good price \u2013 elsewhere in central London the prices are bonkers. I\u2019m from Luton but I commute to Soho to work and stop by here especially. It\u2019s quick service and great for vegetarians. Since they brought in the vegan roll it\u2019s been fantastic. Occasionally, I get the tuna bake. I\u2019m a regular here but it\u2019s not my daily routine \u2013 it would be too fattening to come every day! It\u2019s my treat for the week. Today, I\u2019ll be having two vegan rolls. Jay Reed, 44, Builder (Great Portland Street branch, London) I love the fact that the price is good and the food tastes great. I work just around the corner. I\u2019m a builder and a regular here. I love the breakfast \u2013 bacon baguettes, sausage rolls and steak bakes are my favourites. We\u2019re back at lunchtime too for one of their sandwiches. Whenever I see a Greggs I pop in and get something \u2013 I can\u2019t resist. Fiona Mayle, 62, works at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Westminster branch, London) Greggs increases my wellbeing in the morning. I live in E13 but work at the FCO. I love that the service is very quick and also the excellent meal deals, which I often get \u2013 a roll with sausage or bacon and a coffee. Today, I will have a lovely sausage roll with tomato sauce \u2013 a great start to the day. Andrew Koumis, 30, analyst (Westminster branch, London) Their sausage rolls are my absolute favourite and great value for money. I\u2019ve been coming to Greggs regularly since this branch opened [last year]. Several of my colleagues and friends also come \u2013 it\u2019s so good to have a branch in the area. Sheena Mal, 29, commerce consultant (Westminster branch, London) I love Greggs \u2013 it\u2019s affordable and tasty. The pasties and the breakfasts are fantastic. Today, I\u2019m having the creamy porridge. I\u2019ve been going to Greggs for years, including the one in the area where I grew up in west London. There\u2019s always something I like and often something new on the menu. Eleanor Lisney, 60, disability campaigner (Westminster branch, London) I live in Greenwich but I\u2019m here for a meeting. It\u2019s great to find Greggs here. I come for the vegan food. I love the vegan rolls. I\u2019m a wheelchair user and in terms of accessibility restaurants are variable but I\u2019ve never found any Greggs inaccessible. It\u2019s good to find a branch at the actual tube station. Prav Gupta, 35; Steve Agate, 45; Masoud Bayat, 42, IT consultants (Westminster branch, London) We\u2019re colleagues and often come here together \u2013 we love how the smell hits you when you get off the escalator first thing in the morning. The breakfasts really set us up for the day, including the omelette and sausage rolls, and nothing beats a good coffee from Greggs to get the day started. Aamna Mohdin, 27, news reporter (Westminster branch, London) I love how cheap it is. I grew up in east London and went to the Greggs there but stopped going for a while. It\u2019s the vegan rolls that have brought me back! Interviews by Anita Sethi",

      "bodyText": "Congress returns to Washington this week after a summer recess punctured by a string of mass shootings under pressure to confront a uniquely American problem: how to combat the scourge of gun violence? Though it has been a quarter of a century since Congress passed significant gun control legislation, Democrats and advocacy groups are displaying a fresh sense of resolve as major American retailers heed public calls for action in response to the recent wave of mass shootings. After weeks of deliberation, Walmart announced it would stop selling ammunition for military-style assault rifles and no longer allow customers to openly carry firearms in their stores. In short order, Kroger, Walgreens, Wegmans and CVS said they too would discourage shoppers from openly carrying guns in their stores. The response from corporate America followed back-to-back tragedies in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, that left 31 people dead last month and a shooting in Odessa, Texas, that left seven people dead. Now, activists say, it\u2019s time for Washington to step up and stop politicians from lagging behind corporate America when it comes to gun reforms. \u201cWhen consumer-facing corporations make moves like this, there is no better statement of the shifting opinion of the American public,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \u201cCongress needs to pass a strong background check law and a strong red flag law. Anything less and the mood of the country will be \u2018See you at the polling booth in 2020.\u2019\u201d Everytown released new data on Friday indicating overwhelming support for new stricter gun laws.

Goss said this reflects the party\u2019s changing electoral coalitions. In the 1990s, when working-class, rural voters were still a key constituency, the party was bitterly divided over the issue and preferred to downplay it. But now Democrats believe guns could be a defining issue in 2020, as they make gains with suburban voters, especially college-educated women fearful for their children\u2019s safety in school. \u201cFor the first time in more than two decades, we believe that guns could be an issue that matters in a real and positive way for Democrats,\u201d said Matt Bennett, executive vice-president for public affairs at Third Way, a centrist Democratic thinktank.

A few years ago, I spent a fascinating hour with a detective exploring the online marketplaces that exist in the so-called \u201cdark web\u201d (shorthand for the parts of the web you can only get to with a <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" title=\"\">Tor</a> browser and some useful addresses).

Different categories of these stolen goods are more or less expensive. (The most expensive logins, as I remember it, were for PayPal). But the funniest thing of all was that some of the marketplaces operated a \u201creputation\u201d system, just like eBay\u2019s. Some vendors had 90%-plus ratings for reliability etc. Some purchasers likewise. Others were less highly regarded. So, one reflected, there really is honour among thieves.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just credit cards and logins that are valuable in this underworld. The most highly prized \u201cgoods\u201d are what hackers call \u201cexploits\u201d \u2013 ie specialist knowledge of vulnerabilities in operating systems or other software that can be exploited by intruders for malign purposes.

But there are other, even less savoury customers too. And there are vendors of varying degrees of transparency and integrity who operate in the marketplace. Companies like <a href=\"https://zerodium.com\" title=\"\">Zerodium</a>, for example, which describes itself as \u201cthe leading exploit acquisition platform for premium zero-days and advanced cybersecurity capabilities\u201d, operate openly. Their modus operandi seems to involve connecting ethical hackers and computer scientists who have discovered vulnerabilities with organisations whose computer systems might suffer from them and would therefore value being alerted.</p> <p>Some zero-day exploits can fetch high prices. This week <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7x584y/exploit-sellers-say-there-are-more-iphone-hacks-on-the-market-than-theyve-ever-seen\" title=\"\">Zerodium announced</a> that it will pay $2.5m to security researchers who provide exploits that allow the complete takeover of Android phones without requiring the target to click on anything. But the big news in the announcement was that Zerodium was valuing the same kinds of exploits on Apple\u2019s iOS operating system at only $2m. Given that the Android system is notoriously littered with security vulnerabilities while iOS is reckoned to be relatively secure, the discrepancy looked like a misprint. Surely the rewards for cracking the more secure system should be higher?</p> <p>In principle, yes. But on 29 August, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html\" title=\"\">Threat Analysis Group\u2019s researchers revealed</a> that m alicious websites had been covertly and successfully hacking iPhones <em>for years</em>. The hacked sites were being used in \u201cindiscriminate watering hole attacks\u201d against their visitors, using iPhone zero-day exploits. Simply visiting a hacked site was enough for the exploit server to attack the iPhone, and if it was successful, install a monitoring implant. Google estimated that these sites received \u201cthousands of visitors\u201d per week. And an enigmatic passage in the Google report \u2013 \u201cTo be targeted might mean simply being born in a certain geographic region or being part of a certain ethnic group\u201d \u2013 has led to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/09/01/ahead-of-iphone-11-new-apple-hack-revelation-will-shock-1-billion-users/#5cada4614feb\" title=\"\">fevered speculation</a> that the culprit was China and the target its Muslim Uighur minority.</p> <p>This revelation of iOS\u2019s unsuspected vulnerability came as a shock to a world that had assumed that the orderly, tightly controlled Apple software ecosystem would be more secure than the chaotic, multi-versioned and unpoliced Android system. Nothing, remember, goes on an iPhone that Apple has not vetted and approved, whereas anything goes on Android. But the corollary of this is that iOS is a complacent monoculture \u2013 a vast billion-strong monoculture. That has two consequences. One is that it\u2019s a juicy target for attackers. The other is that if you are confident that your phone is secure then you will be cavalier in what you do with it.

Surely the rewards for cracking the more secure system should be higher? In principle, yes. But on 29 August, Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group\u2019s researchers revealed that m alicious websites had been covertly and successfully hacking iPhones for years. The hacked sites were being used in \u201cindiscriminate watering hole attacks\u201d against their visitors, using iPhone zero-day exploits. Simply visiting a hacked site was enough for the exploit server to attack the iPhone, and if it was successful, install a monitoring implant. Google estimated that these sites received \u201cthousands of visitors\u201d per week. And an enigmatic passage in the Google report \u2013 \u201cTo be targeted might mean simply being born in a certain geographic region or being part of a certain ethnic group\u201d \u2013 has led to fevered speculation that the culprit was China and the target its Muslim Uighur minority. This revelation of iOS\u2019s unsuspected vulnerability came as a shock to a world that had assumed that the orderly, tightly controlled Apple software ecosystem would be more secure than the chaotic, multi-versioned and unpoliced Android system. Nothing, remember, goes on an iPhone that Apple has not vetted and approved, whereas anything goes on Android. But the corollary of this is that iOS is a complacent monoculture \u2013 a vast billion-strong monoculture. That has two consequences. One is that it\u2019s a juicy target for attackers. The other is that if you are confident that your phone is secure then you will be cavalier in what you do with it. Which leads one to wonder how many Uighurs are now ruing the day they first thought of buying an iPhone. What I\u2019m reading Ne\u2019er the twain Two systems, one world. That\u2019s the subject of a thoughtful essay on the Project Syndicate site by Joshka Fischer, former German foreign minister, about the prospect of a bi-polar world dominated by China and the US. The word on the street There\u2019s some wonderful reportage by Maciej Ceg\u0142owski on his idlewords.com blog about being among the demonstrators on the streets of Hong Kong.

Each comes with four vegan stops over a four-hour tour, with breakfast, lunch in two parts and dessert (from \u20ac55). Prague Prague has seen an increase in meat-free restaurants in recent years, from a vegan doughnut shop to socially conscious veggie cafes employing homeless and disadvantaged people. I Like Veggie runs tours of the historic centre, exploring the new healthy gastronomy that is gathering force in the Czech capital, as an alternative to the country\u2019s traditional meat-oriented dishes. There are four stops \u2013 including a raved-about raw cake \u2013 and sightseeing stops at the famous Astronomical Clock, the Old Town Square and Municipal House (four hours, \u20ac80) of Prague\u2019s historic centre. Stockholm According to a study last year, 30% of Swedes say they are eating more plant-based foods in a bid to help save the environment. For a taste of that Scandi spirit, Stockholm Food Tours\u2019 vegetarian walk explores the southern district of S\u00f6dermalm, a favourite with locals for its creative vibe and innovative restaurants. The four-hour tour (\u00a377pp) mixes neighbourhood delis, high-end and health food restaurants \u2013 including a vegan buffet with panoramic city views \u2013 and also caters for raw food diets. Budapest Hungarian cuisine is traditionally meat-heavy, but it now has plenty of options for hungry vegan travellers. Budapest 101 offers private, tailormade tours with a local hosts (four hours, from \u20ac46pp for up to six), exploring Hungarian history and culture while tasting the city\u2019s best veggie and vegan food, from traditional pickles to cakes, coffee and wine. Stops include markets, confectioners and health food shops for gooey, fried vegan cheese and traditional krumplis t\u00e9szta (potato pasta and paprika). Lisbon Also by Vegan Food Tours and new for this year is a journey around the pretty bakeries and squares of Lisbon\u2019s Baixa district (pictured) \u2013 the city\u2019s historic heart famous for its neoclassical architecture \u2013 for dairy-free pastries, \u201csteak\u201d sandwiches made with seitan and vegan cheese, and local vegan wine (three hours, from \u20ac59/\u20ac19pp). For traditional Portuguese food (adapted to be meat- and dairy-free) in a rural setting, take a trip to an organic farm in Sintra west of Lisbon. A farm tour is followed by a cooking class using seasonal ingredients \u2013 participants can then eat their creations at a table with a sea view (\u20ac40pp). Athens Courgette fritters with tzakiki, slabs of feta, stuffed vine leaves and spinach pie\u2026 Vegetarians are unlikely to go hungry in Greece. But vegans can get their fill too \u2013 and the Secret Vegan Tour in Athens comes with a warning to bring an empty stomach. The two-hour-15-min tour includes vegan tacos, gyros souvlaki, Greek salad (pictured) and waffles with ice-cream, plus booze (\u20ac55). The company, Vegan Tour Athens, also runs a Beach Vegan Tour, heading out to two lesser-known beaches close to the city, with lunch at an award-winning restaurant, including vegan cheese tasting and raw food desserts (six hours, \u20ac109pp). Owner Frank is also the organiser of the Vegan Life Festival in Greece, with a bill of talks, exhibitions and parties (next on in Crete, 5-6 Oct 2019). \u2022 Looking for a holiday with a difference?

But they are not happy.</p> <p>Andrew Yang, the tech entrepreneur turned presidential candidate, is being given the cold shoulder by the mainstream media, says Scott Santens, a writer and Yang advocate. As his chihuahua Titus plays in his lap Santens shows me his Twitter feed where he has documented how many times Yang has been slighted.</p> <p>One screenshot from CNN titled \u201cTop choice for Dem nominee\u201d shows the six leading candidates from a Quinnipiac poll that put Joe Biden in the top spot with Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg behind.

But as he scrolls through more and more \u201ccrazy weird\u201d examples of how Yang has been excluded from mainstream coverage of the Democratic field his evidence becomes compelling.</p> <p>\u201cIn aggregate it looks way too weird to be an accident,\u201d says Santens. Twitter agreed and #YangMediaBlackout went viral thanks to Santens.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s gathering of the Yang Gang was just one of hundreds of similar events being <a href=\"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/\">organized across the country</a> to promote Yang, who is in many ways the dark horse of the Democratic race. His fundraising, which had been lackluster, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/andrew-yang-democratic-presidential-race-fundraising-yang-gang-868481/\">took off </a>after the last presidential debate where he shone, despite having the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/politics/cnn-dem-debate-night-two-btn/index.html\">least speaking time</a>. He has another chance to shine on 12 September when the top 10 Democrats hold their next debate.</p> <p>Media blindspots are not new news. A look back at the early coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy shows ample evidence the media is not always good at judging the seriousness of candidates\u2019 chances when they don\u2019t fit the usual mould. And Yang certainly doesn\u2019t fit the mould. He is not from the political establishment like Biden, Warren or Sanders. Nor is he a careerist aspirant to that class like O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg. He\u2019s a nerdy Asian technocrat. His hats read \u201cMath\u201d not Maga.

      "bodyText": "The Yang Gang are huddled round a collection of tables in the back of the Bayou Beer Garden in New Orleans knocking back local beers. It\u2019s a beautiful evening, it\u2019s dry, the sun is out and the gang have been spared the city\u2019s often oppressive humidity. But they are not happy. Andrew Yang, the tech entrepreneur turned presidential candidate, is being given the cold shoulder by the mainstream media, says Scott Santens, a writer and Yang advocate. As his chihuahua Titus plays in his lap Santens shows me his Twitter feed where he has documented how many times Yang has been slighted. One screenshot from CNN titled \u201cTop choice for Dem nominee\u201d shows the six leading candidates from a Quinnipiac poll that put Joe Biden in the top spot with Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg behind. In sixth position is Beto O\u2019Rourke, who polled just 1%. Yang had polled 3%. \u201cWhat!\u201d exclaims Santens. It\u2019s initially tempting to dismiss Santens\u2019 ire. But as he scrolls through more and more \u201ccrazy weird\u201d examples of how Yang has been excluded from mainstream coverage of the Democratic field his evidence becomes compelling. \u201cIn aggregate it looks way too weird to be an accident,\u201d says Santens. Twitter agreed and #YangMediaBlackout went viral thanks to Santens. Last week\u2019s gathering of the Yang Gang was just one of hundreds of similar events being organized across the country to promote Yang, who is in many ways the dark horse of the Democratic race. His fundraising, which had been lackluster, took off after the last presidential debate where he shone, despite having the least speaking time. He has another chance to shine on 12 September when the top 10 Democrats hold their next debate. Media blindspots are not new news. A look back at the early coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy shows ample evidence the media is not always good at judging the seriousness of candidates\u2019 chances when they don\u2019t fit the usual mould. And Yang certainly doesn\u2019t fit the mould. He is not from the political establishment like Biden, Warren or Sanders. Nor is he a careerist aspirant to that class like O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg. He\u2019s a nerdy Asian technocrat. His hats read \u201cMath\u201d not Maga. He\u2019s pro-marijuana legalization, wants to make Puerto Rico a state, lower the voting age to 16 and give every cop a camera. But his unique selling point is he wants to give every American $1,000 a month, a handout he believes will end poverty and transform American society. Yang himself has provided the best introduction to why people join the Yang Gang. The War on Normal People, his 2018 book, is both highly worrying, charming and deeply odd. The bulk of it is an analysis of the current jobs market, income inequality and the impact of technology on current trends if nothing changes. Artificial intelligence will hollow out the jobs market, Yang predicts. It will start with cashiers, receptionists and truck drivers and then make its way up the income ladder taking jobs from everyone from journalists to surgeons and accountants. His analysis is serious and convincing, his conclusions stark. \u201cThe future without jobs will come to resemble either the cultivated benevolence of Star Trek or the desperate scramble for resources of Mad Max,\u201d he writes. \u201cUnless there is a dramatic course correction, I fear we are heading toward the latter.\u201d After reading an early draft one of his friends suggested he change the title to: We\u2019reFucked.

      "body": "<p>The reactions you get to saying you\u2019re doing Oslo, one of the most expensive cities in the world, \u201con the cheap,\u201d are a lot like those you\u2019d get if you announced your plans to fund your own space agency, or build a malaria lab in your upstairs bedroom. Friends, colleagues, even curious passersby, will affect not mere dubiousness, but wild, mocking scepticism.</p> \n<p>Undeterred, or perhaps inspired, I set out to see what could be done on an Oslo day trip, without resorting to remortgaging my hair or selling my trousers for scrap. Landing in Oslo airport at 10am for my 12-hour jaunt in the city, I decided my first cost-saving measure would be to buy an Impulskort, which allowed me 24 hours\u2019 travel on the city\u2019s trains, trams, buses, certain waterways and \u2013 most pleasingly of all \u2013 a speedy shuttle train to and from the airport to the city centre, all for 246 kroner (roughly \u00a323). Satisfied that, whatever else happened, I wouldn\u2019t have to flee my Nordic debtors on foot, I took a short trip on the immaculate airport train and began my adventure in earnest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fdc2b46b4c40ec814a1c84d5a9e82d8c588d2d3b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdc2b46b4c40ec814a1c84d5a9e82d8c588d2d3b/304_297_5441_3265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peaceful: the Nobel Peace centre in Oslo.

The city\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/eastern-norway/oslo/oslo-opera-house/\" title=\"\">opera house</a> is an ideal space to take in the glory of Oslo by walking up the sloping marble crevasse on its side, a rare landmark that\u2019s roughly 80% ramp. Ascending to the height of its auspicious roof gives you an impressive view over the entire city. Two landmarks down, zero kroner spent, I smugly set off for the flurry of museums located a few miles away by train, in the forested peninsula of <a href=\"https://www.visitoslo.com/en/activities-and-attractions/boroughs/bygdoy/\" title=\"\">Bygd\u00f8y</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/07/interactive-co2-widget\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There, at the splendid <a href=\"https://www.khm.uio.no/english/visit-us/viking-ship-museum/\" title=\"\">Viking Ship Museum</a>, I learned how Norwegians once travelled the world, making millions by raiding and pillaging as far as the Mediterranean and Middle East. This so enriched them that they buried beautiful objects of great value with their fallen dead, some spectacular examples of which are collected here among the wonderfully restored, full-size longboats. Of course, the Vikings stopped all the travelling when they realised they could achieve the same effect without leaving the house, by simply getting the rest of the world to come visit, and charging them \u00a34.60 for a can of coke on arrival.</p> \n<p>Joking aside, when it comes to cultural attractions, Oslo isn\u2019t that eye-wateringly expensive in the grand scheme. I visited several museums while I was there, and they were uniformly excellent. The <a href=\"https://frammuseum.no/\" title=\"\">Fram Museum</a>, in particular, represents great value for \u00a311, with its innovatively designed attractions, installations and video pieces, and the sheer mammoth scale of its incredible centrepiece: Roald Amundsen\u2019s exploration ship, the Fram, complete with explorable cabins, store rooms and top deck. While the Viking Ships Museum was certainly smaller for its \u00a39 asking price, its ticket also grants you free admission to the <a href=\"https://www.khm.uio.no/english/visit-us/historical-museum/\" title=\"\">Historical Museum</a> in the city centre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14c812bd4c7be735e0f587e566d4a20aeb7e3359\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14c812bd4c7be735e0f587e566d4a20aeb7e3359/0_135_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A dizzying array of poses and positions\u2019: two of 212 statues by Gustav Vigeland in Frogland Park.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A dizzying array of poses and positions\u2019\u2026 two of 212 statues by Gustav Vigeland in Frogland Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One pleasant way to find your way back is by waterbus. For around \u00a35, it will take you from Bygd\u00f8y to the opera house and give you a nice 20-minute trip round the sights of the fjord. It\u2019s also a good spot to indulge in a few quick rounds of PriceSpotting, the game in which you and fellow travellers try and one-up each other on best bits of value you\u2019ve encountered. For fellow passengers, Alf and Chris Saville, visiting from England, it was the medieval castle, <a href=\"https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/akershus-fortress/432/\" title=\"\">Akershus Fortress</a>, on the Oslo harbour front; free to enter, pleasantly capacious, and filled with interesting corners to snoop around in.</p> \n<p>Stopping at Sentrum will take you in the direction of the Nobel Peace Center (\u00a311) and the Historical Museum. This will also take you past some cheaper eating options in the form of street food vans offering everything from fish and chips (\u00a38-10 for a hearty serving) to Thai food (\u00a39 for pad thai or red curry, or five spring rolls for \u00a35).</p> \n<p>A little further from existing tramlines is Oslo\u2019s crown tourist jewel, the <a href=\"https://www.visitoslo.com/en/product/?TLp=181601\" title=\"\">Vigeland exhibit in Frogner Park</a>. The exhibit comprises 212 statues made by Gustav Vigeland, almost all of which are of naked men, women and children in a dizzying array of poses and positions, all seemingly conceived deliberately to make those with less Scandinavian attitudes to nudity feel decidedly square. The whole thing is vast, mesmerising, and entirely free. Less well known is the <a href=\"https://www.emanuelvigeland.museum.no/museum.htm\" title=\"\">mausoleum</a> of his brother, Emmanuel. Housed in a brick building that\u2019s open for a few hours each week, it showcases his distinctly dark and brooding paintings depicting just about every sin imaginable. Very much the Solange of the Vigeland brothers, Emmanuel\u2019s works are less famous but carry a frisson of cool which Gustav\u2019s may never attain. A trip inside will cost about \u00a35, and serve as an edgier alternative to his brother\u2019s nudes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4262f911929c19ca142181edfbee5d574c016f1e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4262f911929c19ca142181edfbee5d574c016f1e/0_358_5372_3223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blue sky at night: Oslo in the evening.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue sky at night \u2026 Oslo in the evening.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nattee Chalermtiragool/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s true that being in a place this expensive does risk making you money obsessed. Even the world\u2019s least materialistic person will find a world where a beer costs \u00a311 fascinating. It\u2019s mind-blowing to imagine Norwegians anywhere else, say, ordering a lukewarm beer on London\u2019s Southbank, before turning to their partner as they fork over \u00a37 and saying, \u201cW\u00f8w, Bj\u00f8rn, look how cheap everything is here.\u201d But, in the end, I made it back for my return flight that evening, having spent roughly \u00a360 in 12 hours, taking in four museums, a gigantic <a href=\"https://www.visitoslo.com/en/product/?TLp=181601\" title=\"\">sculpture park</a>, an opera house, a beautiful harbour walk, a boat trip and delightful interactions with the city\u2019s locals, most of whom have the sunny, easygoing mien of either heavy metal roadies or tennis coaches.</p> \n<p>Only once did I get into anything resembling a harsh word, when a woman near a public bathroom turned to complain about the price. \u201c15 kroner!\u201d she said, in bemusement. \u201cWow\u201d I replied, joining in. \u201cCrazy!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she said, although now scowling ever so slightly, \u201cbut you have to also remember that it\u2019s very clean.\u201d I forgave her for unintentionally levelling a vague accusation as to the cleanliness of the toilets I\u2019m used to, for I had misstepped. It\u2019s clearly one thing for a local to complain about the prices, but visitors should perhaps mind their Ps and \u00d8s.</p> \n<h2>Way to go</h2> \n<p><br><em>Seamas flew Ryanair to Oslo Gardermoen airport from about \u00a320 with Ryanair.

      "bodyText": "The reactions you get to saying you\u2019re doing Oslo, one of the most expensive cities in the world, \u201con the cheap,\u201d are a lot like those you\u2019d get if you announced your plans to fund your own space agency, or build a malaria lab in your upstairs bedroom. Friends, colleagues, even curious passersby, will affect not mere dubiousness, but wild, mocking scepticism. Undeterred, or perhaps inspired, I set out to see what could be done on an Oslo day trip, without resorting to remortgaging my hair or selling my trousers for scrap. Landing in Oslo airport at 10am for my 12-hour jaunt in the city, I decided my first cost-saving measure would be to buy an Impulskort, which allowed me 24 hours\u2019 travel on the city\u2019s trains, trams, buses, certain waterways and \u2013 most pleasingly of all \u2013 a speedy shuttle train to and from the airport to the city centre, all for 246 kroner (roughly \u00a323). Satisfied that, whatever else happened, I wouldn\u2019t have to flee my Nordic debtors on foot, I took a short trip on the immaculate airport train and began my adventure in earnest. Twenty-five minutes later, I arrived at Oslo\u2019s central station right in front of more than a few free activities, and took a pleasant walk around the majestic fjord-side harbour. The city\u2019s opera house is an ideal space to take in the glory of Oslo by walking up the sloping marble crevasse on its side, a rare landmark that\u2019s roughly 80% ramp. Ascending to the height of its auspicious roof gives you an impressive view over the entire city. Two landmarks down, zero kroner spent, I smugly set off for the flurry of museums located a few miles away by train, in the forested peninsula of Bygd\u00f8y. There, at the splendid Viking Ship Museum, I learned how Norwegians once travelled the world, making millions by raiding and pillaging as far as the Mediterranean and Middle East. This so enriched them that they buried beautiful objects of great value with their fallen dead, some spectacular examples of which are collected here among the wonderfully restored, full-size longboats. Of course, the Vikings stopped all the travelling when they realised they could achieve the same effect without leaving the house, by simply getting the rest of the world to come visit, and charging them \u00a34.60 for a can of coke on arrival. Joking aside, when it comes to cultural attractions, Oslo isn\u2019t that eye-wateringly expensive in the grand scheme. I visited several museums while I was there, and they were uniformly excellent. The Fram Museum, in particular, represents great value for \u00a311, with its innovatively designed attractions, installations and video pieces, and the sheer mammoth scale of its incredible centrepiece: Roald Amundsen\u2019s exploration ship, the Fram, complete with explorable cabins, store rooms and top deck. While the Viking Ships Museum was certainly smaller for its \u00a39 asking price, its ticket also grants you free admission to the Historical Museum in the city centre. One pleasant way to find your way back is by waterbus. For around \u00a35, it will take you from Bygd\u00f8y to the opera house and give you a nice 20-minute trip round the sights of the fjord. It\u2019s also a good spot to indulge in a few quick rounds of PriceSpotting, the game in which you and fellow travellers try and one-up each other on best bits of value you\u2019ve encountered. For fellow passengers, Alf and Chris Saville, visiting from England, it was the medieval castle, Akershus Fortress, on the Oslo harbour front; free to enter, pleasantly capacious, and filled with interesting corners to snoop around in. Stopping at Sentrum will take you in the direction of the Nobel Peace Center (\u00a311) and the Historical Museum. This will also take you past some cheaper eating options in the form of street food vans offering everything from fish and chips (\u00a38-10 for a hearty serving) to Thai food (\u00a39 for pad thai or red curry, or five spring rolls for \u00a35). A little further from existing tramlines is Oslo\u2019s crown tourist jewel, the Vigeland exhibit in Frogner Park. The exhibit comprises 212 statues made by Gustav Vigeland, almost all of which are of naked men, women and children in a dizzying array of poses and positions, all seemingly conceived deliberately to make those with less Scandinavian attitudes to nudity feel decidedly square. The whole thing is vast, mesmerising, and entirely free. Less well known is the mausoleum of his brother, Emmanuel. Housed in a brick building that\u2019s open for a few hours each week, it showcases his distinctly dark and brooding paintings depicting just about every sin imaginable. Very much the Solange of the Vigeland brothers, Emmanuel\u2019s works are less famous but carry a frisson of cool which Gustav\u2019s may never attain. A trip inside will cost about \u00a35, and serve as an edgier alternative to his brother\u2019s nudes. It\u2019s true that being in a place this expensive does risk making you money obsessed. Even the world\u2019s least materialistic person will find a world where a beer costs \u00a311 fascinating. It\u2019s mind-blowing to imagine Norwegians anywhere else, say, ordering a lukewarm beer on London\u2019s Southbank, before turning to their partner as they fork over \u00a37 and saying, \u201cW\u00f8w, Bj\u00f8rn, look how cheap everything is here.\u201d But, in the end, I made it back for my return flight that evening, having spent roughly \u00a360 in 12 hours, taking in four museums, a gigantic sculpture park, an opera house, a beautiful harbour walk, a boat trip and delightful interactions with the city\u2019s locals, most of whom have the sunny, easygoing mien of either heavy metal roadies or tennis coaches. Only once did I get into anything resembling a harsh word, when a woman near a public bathroom turned to complain about the price. \u201c15 kroner!\u201d she said, in bemusement. \u201cWow\u201d I replied, joining in. \u201cCrazy!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she said, although now scowling ever so slightly, \u201cbut you have to also remember that it\u2019s very clean.\u201d I forgave her for unintentionally levelling a vague accusation as to the cleanliness of the toilets I\u2019m used to, for I had misstepped. It\u2019s clearly one thing for a local to complain about the prices, but visitors should perhaps mind their Ps and \u00d8s.

The state should not be concerned with an individual\u2019s religious beliefs or his means of salvation.</p> <p>Written at a time when Europe was rent by religious strife, and when intolerance and persecution were the norm, it was a powerful argument for religious freedom.

Neither Catholics nor atheists were, in his view, deserving of tolerance, the former because they gave their allegiance to a \u201cforeign prince\u201d (the pope), the latter because their opinions were \u201ccontrary\u2026 to the preservation of civil society\u201d.</p> <p>And here lies the significance of the newly discovered document. Written some 20 years before <em>A Letter Concerning Toleration</em>, its very title cuts against the grain of much of what we know of his thought.</p> <p>\u201cIf Papists can be supposd to be as good subjects as others,\u201d he writes, \u201cthey may be equally tolerated.\u201d This has led many scholars to suggest, like Walmsley, that Locke was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/03/unknown-text-by-john- locke-reveals-roots-of-foundational-democratic-ideas\" title=\"\">\u201cmuch more tolerant in certain respects than was ever previously supposed\u201d</a>.</p> <p>That seems doubtful. What the new manuscript shows was that Locke was aware of the arguments for religious freedom being extended to Catholics but in his published work he rejected them. Catholics were not \u201cas good subjects as others\u201d because their beliefs threatened society and so had to be excluded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a386d440fc855172dc08c16b7ca1baccd3a50793\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a386d440fc855172dc08c16b7ca1baccd3a50793/0_52_2900_3623/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Locke (1632\u20131704).\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Locke (1632\u20131704).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stock Montage/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This blindness to the meaning of tolerance was not peculiar to Locke. The question of what, and who, should be tolerated has been a fraught issue for liberal thought over four centuries. Today, anti-Catholic bigotry has largely faded. But Jews and, more recently, Muslims have faced the same argument that once applied to Catholics \u2013 that they have a \u201cdual loyalty\u201d and that their beliefs threaten society.</p> <p>Today, too, the question of what we should tolerate is as contested as it was in Locke\u2019s time. From sedition to hate speech, from fake news to the giving of offence, there is a plethora of arguments about the need to constrain speech so as not to harm society, arguments that are often as hollow as Locke\u2019s.</p> <p>The Enlightenment thinker who adopted a truly liberal attitude towards toleration was not Locke but the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, whose work is far too little known, especially in the Anglophone world.</p> <p>Locke, as the historian Jonathan Israel <a href=\"https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4194/seeing-reason-jonathan-israels-radical-vision\" title=\"\">has sketched out</a> in a series of monumental books, was a key figure of the \u201cmainstream\u201d Enlightenment, while Spinoza was a guiding light of the \u201cradical\u201d wing. The mainstream, Israel suggests, was constrained in its ability to critique laws and conventions by its intellectual and social timidity. The radical Enlightenment was far less willing to compromise its beliefs about toleration, democracy and equality.</p> <p>This distinction is particularly visible on the question of freedom of expression. \u201cThe less freedom of judgment is granted to men,\u201d Spinoza said,\u201cthe further are they removed from the most natural state and consequently the more repressive the regime.\u201d Involvement by the state, he insisted, \u201cshould be restricted to men\u2019s actions, with everyone being allowed to think what he wishes and say what he thinks\u201d. It is a view that seems startling even today.</p> <p>So, let us celebrate a great historical find in the new Locke manuscript. But if we want to address questions of tolerance we would do far better to look to Spinoza than to Locke.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

And here lies the significance of the newly discovered document. Written some 20 years before A Letter Concerning Toleration, its very title cuts against the grain of much of what we know of his thought. \u201cIf Papists can be supposd to be as good subjects as others,\u201d he writes, \u201cthey may be equally tolerated.\u201d This has led many scholars to suggest, like Walmsley, that Locke was \u201cmuch more tolerant in certain respects than was ever previously supposed\u201d. That seems doubtful. What the new manuscript shows was that Locke was aware of the arguments for religious freedom being extended to Catholics but in his published work he rejected them. Catholics were not \u201cas good subjects as others\u201d because their beliefs threatened society and so had to be excluded. This blindness to the meaning of tolerance was not peculiar to Locke. The question of what, and who, should be tolerated has been a fraught issue for liberal thought over four centuries. Today, anti-Catholic bigotry has largely faded. But Jews and, more recently, Muslims have faced the same argument that once applied to Catholics \u2013 that they have a \u201cdual loyalty\u201d and that their beliefs threaten society. Today, too, the question of what we should tolerate is as contested as it was in Locke\u2019s time. From sedition to hate speech, from fake news to the giving of offence, there is a plethora of arguments about the need to constrain speech so as not to harm society, arguments that are often as hollow as Locke\u2019s. The Enlightenment thinker who adopted a truly liberal attitude towards toleration was not Locke but the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, whose work is far too little known, especially in the Anglophone world. Locke, as the historian Jonathan Israel has sketched out in a series of monumental books, was a key figure of the \u201cmainstream\u201d Enlightenment, while Spinoza was a guiding light of the \u201cradical\u201d wing. The mainstream, Israel suggests, was constrained in its ability to critique laws and conventions by its intellectual and social timidity. The radical Enlightenment was far less willing to compromise its beliefs about toleration, democracy and equality. This distinction is particularly visible on the question of freedom of expression. \u201cThe less freedom of judgment is granted to men,\u201d Spinoza said,\u201cthe further are they removed from the most natural state and consequently the more repressive the regime.\u201d Involvement by the state, he insisted, \u201cshould be restricted to men\u2019s actions, with everyone being allowed to think what he wishes and say what he thinks\u201d. It is a view that seems startling even today. So, let us celebrate a great historical find in the new Locke manuscript. But if we want to address questions of tolerance we would do far better to look to Spinoza than to Locke. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>A grim little vaudeville act is currently touring some of Scotland\u2019s Catholic parishes, featuring the remains of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, a long-dead French nun. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 in 1897 and was canonised in 1925, becoming Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face. By all accounts, this young woman developed an exemplary devotion to her faith and was the author of some beautiful (if slightly ripe) spiritual tracts. I\u2019m not sure she deserved the fate of having some of her remains bumped in and out of cars and through the hills of South Lanarkshire and Paisley for the devoted titillation of the faithful.</p> <p>These relics of Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se are considered to be \u201cfirst class\u201d, this being the ultimate seal of Vatican authentication. To be accorded this distinction, they must be parts of the bodies of the saints, such as fragments of bone, skin, blood, hair or ash. Apparently, poor dead Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (or parts thereof) has been getting ferried like this throughout the Catholic world since 1994. Is there no one to call a halt to this unedifying distortion of faith? Can we not let this blameless lassie rest in peace?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The church, still reeling from the global crisis of clerical sex abuse, is keen to encourage devotion like this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In secular society, we similarly raise up those who have performed feats of heroism that inspire us to make more of ourselves or to come to the aid of those in need. Behold the Scotland national football team. Our squad hasn\u2019t qualified for a proper international tournament for 21 years and has long been tormented by the feats of better generations. The ghosts of great Scottish managers and players still haunt Hampden Park and our modern performers seem mesmerised by their shadows as they struggle to master the basics of the game. Thus, there were more people interested in attending Scotland\u2019s rugby international against Georgia than our footballers\u2019 encounter with Russia on Friday night. Perhaps we could seek permission from the families of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/bill-shankly\" title=\"\">Bill Shankly</a>, Jim Baxter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/14/guardianobituaries.football\" title=\"\">Jimmy Johnstone</a> to exhume their bodies in the national interest.</p> <p>A lock of Shankly\u2019s hair or Baxter\u2019s left metatarsal or a bone fragment from Jinky\u2019s hips, which he used to swivel and pirouette away from defenders, could be secured and placed in a casket. These could then be borne aloft through the neighbourhoods that reared these great footballers for the purposes of rekindling interest among these communities for our national sport. Perhaps, too, something of the sorcery interred in their bones might escape into the feet of a passing urchin and transport him to greatness in a dark blue jersey.</p> <p>When the church\u2019s spinmeisters urge its followers to bow down in medieval veneration to the bleached fragments of dead heroes you know that political machinations lie beneath. Our secular aristocracy relies on the fecundity of the royal family or the sacrifice of its soldiers in contrived theatres of war to avert our gaze from problems nearer to home. And the Roman Catholic church, still reeling from the global crisis of clerical sex abuse, is keen to encourage supernatural devotion like this for the purposes of redirecting scrutiny of its own grievous failings.</p> <p>The success of the Reformation lay in freeing people from the spiritual slavery of Rome, where the bones of saints and counterfeit fragments of the Holy Cross had become an industry. The profits from this paid for the ruinous and brutal Crusades (and the beginning of Islamophobia).</p> <p>The reformers offered a purer and less unequal route to heaven and the mercy of God, unencumbered by profiteering, exploitation and superstition. It wasn\u2019t just a theological revolution, but a temporal one, which seemed to say that you didn\u2019t need to wait until you entered paradise to experience equality and fairness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"28f8d4d5290feb4fb08e893d0dbd164cc3737d41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28f8d4d5290feb4fb08e893d0dbd164cc3737d41/1537_196_1082_1352/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cardinal Raymond Burke:\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cardinal Raymond Burke: \u2018a totem for rightwing Catholic conservatives\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franco Origlia/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s relics continue on their ghostly tour up and down the hills and glens, the visit to Scotland takes place of the American cardinal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Leo_Burke\" title=\"\">Raymond Burke</a>, perhaps the most powerful Catholic churchman after Pope Francis. Burke, who has long viewed the current pope\u2019s relaxed and compassionate views on human sexuality and the environment with deep suspicion, has become his greatest critic. He has thus become a totem for rightwing Catholic conservatives, a powerful and influential lobby, which is currently being wooed by Donald Trump and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/13/steve-bannon-matteo-salvini-pope-francis-is-the-enemy\" title=\"\">his chosen acolyte in this field, Steve Bannon</a>. Perhaps it\u2019s merely a coincidence that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s posthumous visit to Scotland is occurring at the same time as Burke\u2019s live one, but I hae ma doots.</p> <p>Among the cardinal\u2019s wide range of reactionary views is that female altar servers are a wretched <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2fnews%2fmorning-mix%2fwp%2f2015%2f01%2f13%2fformer-highest-ranking-u-s-cardinal-blames-feminized-church-for-the-catholic-churchs-problems%2f%3f\" title=\"\">sign of the increased \u201cfeminisation\u201d of the church</a>. \u201cThe introduction of girl servers led many boys to abandon altar service,\u201d he has said. \u201cYoung boys don\u2019t want to do things with girls. It\u2019s just natural.\u201d This is rubbish, of course. Where I grew up, if young female altar servers had been allowed there would have been a stampede among the boys to toil in the Lord\u2019s vineyard alongside them. Burke also views any form of gay relationships as \u201cevil\u201d and has encouraged Catholics not to expose their children to close relatives who are actively gay. He\u2019s had less to say about why the God he purports to serve and who does not make mistakes created, in His wisdom, gay people.</p> <p>The familiars and acolytes attending this false prophet will include a shadowy assortment of arcane organisations that seek to preserve unfettered clerical control and power by means of exclusion and unholy inquisition. Spare a thought for us Catholics at this time. Not only are we seeking to deal with Brexit in the secular world but leave this shower of ecclesiastical Blimps in the spiritual one.</p> <p>\u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "A grim little vaudeville act is currently touring some of Scotland\u2019s Catholic parishes, featuring the remains of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, a long-dead French nun. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 in 1897 and was canonised in 1925, becoming Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face. By all accounts, this young woman developed an exemplary devotion to her faith and was the author of some beautiful (if slightly ripe) spiritual tracts. I\u2019m not sure she deserved the fate of having some of her remains bumped in and out of cars and through the hills of South Lanarkshire and Paisley for the devoted titillation of the faithful. These relics of Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se are considered to be \u201cfirst class\u201d, this being the ultimate seal of Vatican authentication. To be accorded this distinction, they must be parts of the bodies of the saints, such as fragments of bone, skin, blood, hair or ash. Apparently, poor dead Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (or parts thereof) has been getting ferried like this throughout the Catholic world since 1994. Is there no one to call a halt to this unedifying distortion of faith? Can we not let this blameless lassie rest in peace? In secular society, we similarly raise up those who have performed feats of heroism that inspire us to make more of ourselves or to come to the aid of those in need. Behold the Scotland national football team. Our squad hasn\u2019t qualified for a proper international tournament for 21 years and has long been tormented by the feats of better generations. The ghosts of great Scottish managers and players still haunt Hampden Park and our modern performers seem mesmerised by their shadows as they struggle to master the basics of the game. Thus, there were more people interested in attending Scotland\u2019s rugby international against Georgia than our footballers\u2019 encounter with Russia on Friday night. Perhaps we could seek permission from the families of Bill Shankly, Jim Baxter and Jimmy Johnstone to exhume their bodies in the national interest. A lock of Shankly\u2019s hair or Baxter\u2019s left metatarsal or a bone fragment from Jinky\u2019s hips, which he used to swivel and pirouette away from defenders, could be secured and placed in a casket. These could then be borne aloft through the neighbourhoods that reared these great footballers for the purposes of rekindling interest among these communities for our national sport. Perhaps, too, something of the sorcery interred in their bones might escape into the feet of a passing urchin and transport him to greatness in a dark blue jersey. When the church\u2019s spinmeisters urge its followers to bow down in medieval veneration to the bleached fragments of dead heroes you know that political machinations lie beneath. Our secular aristocracy relies on the fecundity of the royal family or the sacrifice of its soldiers in contrived theatres of war to avert our gaze from problems nearer to home. And the Roman Catholic church, still reeling from the global crisis of clerical sex abuse, is keen to encourage supernatural devotion like this for the purposes of redirecting scrutiny of its own grievous failings. The success of the Reformation lay in freeing people from the spiritual slavery of Rome, where the bones of saints and counterfeit fragments of the Holy Cross had become an industry. The profits from this paid for the ruinous and brutal Crusades (and the beginning of Islamophobia). The reformers offered a purer and less unequal route to heaven and the mercy of God, unencumbered by profiteering, exploitation and superstition. It wasn\u2019t just a theological revolution, but a temporal one, which seemed to say that you didn\u2019t need to wait until you entered paradise to experience equality and fairness. While Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s relics continue on their ghostly tour up and down the hills and glens, the visit to Scotland takes place of the American cardinal Raymond Burke, perhaps the most powerful Catholic churchman after Pope Francis. Burke, who has long viewed the current pope\u2019s relaxed and compassionate views on human sexuality and the environment with deep suspicion, has become his greatest critic. He has thus become a totem for rightwing Catholic conservatives, a powerful and influential lobby, which is currently being wooed by Donald Trump and his chosen acolyte in this field, Steve Bannon. Perhaps it\u2019s merely a coincidence that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s posthumous visit to Scotland is occurring at the same time as Burke\u2019s live one, but I hae ma doots. Among the cardinal\u2019s wide range of reactionary views is that female altar servers are a wretched sign of the increased \u201cfeminisation\u201d of the church. \u201cThe introduction of girl servers led many boys to abandon altar service,\u201d he has said. \u201cYoung boys don\u2019t want to do things with girls. It\u2019s just natural.\u201d This is rubbish, of course. Where I grew up, if young female altar servers had been allowed there would have been a stampede among the boys to toil in the Lord\u2019s vineyard alongside them. Burke also views any form of gay relationships as \u201cevil\u201d and has encouraged Catholics not to expose their children to close relatives who are actively gay. He\u2019s had less to say about why the God he purports to serve and who does not make mistakes created, in His wisdom, gay people. The familiars and acolytes attending this false prophet will include a shadowy assortment of arcane organisations that seek to preserve unfettered clerical control and power by means of exclusion and unholy inquisition. Spare a thought for us Catholics at this time. Not only are we seeking to deal with Brexit in the secular world but leave this shower of ecclesiastical Blimps in the spiritual one. \u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist",

I rarely find a mainstream styling product that works on my hair, which is why Davines Oi range (for it is all good) delights me so. The hair butter - and yes it is the texture of a light butter without the greasiness - is a considerable softener, anti-frizz agent and hydrator that also works as a breakage-prevention treatment. The key ingredient is roucou oil, which helps to restructure, strengthen and protect the hair. I use a tiny bit every other day to keep my hair ends soft, frizz free and less prone to snapping off. If you have really fine hair, you are better off using it as a pre-shampoo nourishing treatment as it might prove too heavy otherwise. Regardless of your hair type, expect softer, more manageable, shinier hair. Oh, and lest I forget, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: the scent - an amber, floral, musk and citrus concoction.

      "bodyText": "The self-image of the public-school ethos from which Boris Johnson springs is best expressed in Thomas Hughes\u2019s high-Victorian novel, Tom Brown\u2019s School Days. But Johnson\u2019s own model is surely not the honourable Tom but the contemptible cad Harry Flashman, as he is so hilariously reimagined in George MacDonald Fraser\u2019s The Flashman Papers. The arch-bounder was sometimes suggested as an avatar for David Cameron but he is surely a better match for Johnson. He rises inexorably to become Sir Harry Flashman VC and brazenly informs us that \u201call my fame and glory has been earned by accident, false pretence, cowardice, doing the dirty, and blind luck\u201d. Flashman makes his career in the military and explains: \u201cSome human faults are military virtues, like stupidity, and arrogance, and narrow-mindedness.\u201d We may take assurance from the very fact that Johnson is prime minister that the same goes for politics. Some human faults \u2013 mendacity, cynicism, opportunism, bluster, recklessness \u2013 are political virtues. But only up to a point. Those qualities have taken Johnson to the pinnacle of power.

MPs would do well to swear something similar this week.<br><strong>Andrew McLuskey</strong><br>Ashford, Middlesex</p> <p>Will Hutton is correct to say that Switzerland has elaborate rules for the conduct of referendums. Any citizen or organisation that collects a defined number of signatures can demand that a referendum be held. The exact wording is drawn up by civil servants and constitutional lawyers in discussions with the proposers to ensure that voters know precisely what they are being asked to agree to.</p> <p>It is even permitted to propose a motion to strike down legislation recently approved in parliament. This ingenious balance between direct democracy and representative democracy has the enormous benefit that legislation for significant change is couched in moderate terms for fear of subsequent rejection by the people.

It has been clear from the outset that the people behind Brexit have very clear intentions. The EU is a capitalist entity that not only rejects the worst aspects of the US system but has the clout to resist its encroachments. The disaster capitalists who want to discard laws designed to limit the ill effects of capitalism on employment, the environment, the climate, food, health etc and unleash an unrestricted race to the bottom will get even richer if Brexit goes through.</p> <p>This was always the purpose behind Brexit, whatever lies have been put up to hide it. These are not people who will be harmed by a no-deal Brexit; on the contrary, the potential to take advantage of it is almost unlimited.<br><strong>Jeremy Cushing</strong><br>Taddyforde, Exeter</p> <h2>Turning down Oxbridge<br></h2> <p>My experience was similar to that of Sophie Hastings\u2019s daughter (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/01/my-daughter-rejected-oxford-university-history-of-art-leeds\" title=\"\">\u201cWhy my daughter said no to Oxbridge\u201d</a>, Focus). I grew up in a working-class family in Barrow-in-Furness and at sixth-form college, it was clear that I was expected to apply to Oxbridge. </p> <p>When the vice-principal, a Cambridge alumnus, took several of us on a visit it seemed a stuffy place to a young man from such a different environment. The trip did a good job of deterring me, but there was still pressure from staff at my college. So I applied to Oxford, did well in the exam, was successful at interview and was made an offer of 2 grade Es. After I rejected Oxford, selecting Warwick, Oxford told my college that it wasn\u2019t too late for me to change my mind and I was called to a meeting with the vice-principal. I remained adamant.</p> <p>When the A-level results came out, the local newspaper had photos of the highest achieving students.

No doubt this resistance played its part, but surely the crux of the inaction lay in Anthony Eden\u2019s statement to parliament after Ed Morrow\u2019s radio broadcast in 1942: the \u201cimmense geographical and other difficulties in the matter\u201d.</p> <p>Bombing of the camps and railways may have been considered impractical (although that might have seriously disrupted the mechanised killing), but the options for Jews already locked inside a Nazi-occupied Europe were virtually non-existent. Some in southern France may have been able to escape into neutral Spain or Portugal, and from there to the US or Britain, but the vast majority would have had no chance of reaching friendly shores, especially the millions trapped inside Poland or the Soviet Union. </p> <p>Even if there had been more political will to do something to prevent further slaughter of the Jews, in practice there was very little that could be done before the camps were overrun towards the end of the war and it is unfair to the wartime allied leaders to suggest that they could have prevented the Holocaust.<br><strong>Melvin Hurst</strong><br>Ventnor, Isle of Wight</p> <h2>Stars aren\u2019t always greener<br></h2> <p>It is disappointing to see that prominent cultural figures Grayson Perry and Olivia Colman, who, one would hope, would put their popularity to good use as beneficial social influencers, are instead encouraging the perpetuation of environmentally damaging behaviour (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/31/pilot-strike-british-airways-passenger-anger-computer-failures\" title=\"\">\u201cStrikes, IT failures, customer unrest: can BA pull out of this nosedive?\u201d,</a> Business).</p> <p>At a time when we must transform our way of life, including a significant reduction in flying, in order to avoid the worst effects of global heating, I hope they will both recognise their mistake and find a way to make amends.<br><strong>Teresa Belton</strong><br>Norwich</p> <h2>Fast fashion, fast everything<br></h2> <p>Fast fashion is not qualitatively different to most other consumer industries in its impact upon the environment (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/31/can-fashion-keep-its-cool-and-help-save-the-planet\" title=\"\">\u201cCan fashion keep its cool?\u201d</a>, Special Report).</p> <p>Consumer goods in general are too cheap, leading to over-consumption and waste, while things that improve the quality of our lives are too expensive (decent housing) or increasingly unavailable (public services).

While priority must be given to ensure that we do not crash out of the EU on 31 October, the need for a Speaker\u2019s conference to draft a new constitution should be pretty high on the agenda. One is reminded of the Tennis Court Oath taken by the members of the French Third Estate in 1789 when they vowed not to dissolve until they had given their country a constitution. MPs would do well to swear something similar this week. Andrew McLuskey Ashford, Middlesex Will Hutton is correct to say that Switzerland has elaborate rules for the conduct of referendums. Any citizen or organisation that collects a defined number of signatures can demand that a referendum be held. The exact wording is drawn up by civil servants and constitutional lawyers in discussions with the proposers to ensure that voters know precisely what they are being asked to agree to. It is even permitted to propose a motion to strike down legislation recently approved in parliament. This ingenious balance between direct democracy and representative democracy has the enormous benefit that legislation for significant change is couched in moderate terms for fear of subsequent rejection by the people. Under such a system, the Brexit vote wouldn\u2019t even have reached the starting line. Karl Gehring Sheffield Nick Cohen says that the Brexit movement \u201chas no purpose now other than to secure an empty victory\u201d (Comment). It has been clear from the outset that the people behind Brexit have very clear intentions. The EU is a capitalist entity that not only rejects the worst aspects of the US system but has the clout to resist its encroachments. The disaster capitalists who want to discard laws designed to limit the ill effects of capitalism on employment, the environment, the climate, food, health etc and unleash an unrestricted race to the bottom will get even richer if Brexit goes through. This was always the purpose behind Brexit, whatever lies have been put up to hide it. These are not people who will be harmed by a no-deal Brexit; on the contrary, the potential to take advantage of it is almost unlimited. Jeremy Cushing Taddyforde, Exeter Turning down Oxbridge My experience was similar to that of Sophie Hastings\u2019s daughter (\u201cWhy my daughter said no to Oxbridge\u201d, Focus). I grew up in a working-class family in Barrow-in-Furness and at sixth-form college, it was clear that I was expected to apply to Oxbridge. When the vice-principal, a Cambridge alumnus, took several of us on a visit it seemed a stuffy place to a young man from such a different environment. The trip did a good job of deterring me, but there was still pressure from staff at my college. So I applied to Oxford, did well in the exam, was successful at interview and was made an offer of 2 grade Es. After I rejected Oxford, selecting Warwick, Oxford told my college that it wasn\u2019t too late for me to change my mind and I was called to a meeting with the vice-principal. I remained adamant. When the A-level results came out, the local newspaper had photos of the highest achieving students. Mine was captioned: \u201cDamian Rogan: turned down place at Oxford.\u201d Damian Rogan London, E16 Holocaust was unstoppable Peter Beaumont (\u201cWWII: eighty years on, the world is still haunted by a catastrophe foretold\u201d, Comment) blames the allied governments, most notably the British and the American ones, for failing to offer relief to the persecuted Jews of Europe, despite the unequivocal evidence of the horrors taking place. He relates the resistance offered by authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, for a variety of reasons, to the very idea of offering sanctuary to the threatened Jews. No doubt this resistance played its part, but surely the crux of the inaction lay in Anthony Eden\u2019s statement to parliament after Ed Morrow\u2019s radio broadcast in 1942: the \u201cimmense geographical and other difficulties in the matter\u201d. Bombing of the camps and railways may have been considered impractical (although that might have seriously disrupted the mechanised killing), but the options for Jews already locked inside a Nazi-occupied Europe were virtually non-existent. Some in southern France may have been able to escape into neutral Spain or Portugal, and from there to the US or Britain, but the vast majority would have had no chance of reaching friendly shores, especially the millions trapped inside Poland or the Soviet Union. Even if there had been more political will to do something to prevent further slaughter of the Jews, in practice there was very little that could be done before the camps were overrun towards the end of the war and it is unfair to the wartime allied leaders to suggest that they could have prevented the Holocaust. Melvin Hurst Ventnor, Isle of Wight Stars aren\u2019t always greener It is disappointing to see that prominent cultural figures Grayson Perry and Olivia Colman, who, one would hope, would put their popularity to good use as beneficial social influencers, are instead encouraging the perpetuation of environmentally damaging behaviour (\u201cStrikes, IT failures, customer unrest: can BA pull out of this nosedive?\u201d, Business). At a time when we must transform our way of life, including a significant reduction in flying, in order to avoid the worst effects of global heating, I hope they will both recognise their mistake and find a way to make amends. Teresa Belton Norwich Fast fashion, fast everything Fast fashion is not qualitatively different to most other consumer industries in its impact upon the environment (\u201cCan fashion keep its cool?\u201d, Special Report). Consumer goods in general are too cheap, leading to over-consumption and waste, while things that improve the quality of our lives are too expensive (decent housing) or increasingly unavailable (public services). We need higher taxes on most goods (as well as on high incomes and wealth) to fund housebuilding, green public transport and other public expenditure. Richard Mountford Tonbridge, Kent All at sea on London buses The MSC G\u00fcls\u00fcn\u2019s containers (\u201cThe shifting patterns of English: Measurements that are meaningless\u201d, Comment), being stacked outside the hull, are built of steel to withstand the onslaught of waves, the weather and the ship\u2019s pitching and rolling during a long ocean voyage. Today, most containers being FEUs (40ft equivalent units), the G\u00fcls\u00fcn can carry up to 11,878 FEUs, each weighing 3.6 tons empty. That\u2019s 42,000 tons of dead-weight steel, the equivalent of 5,701 old London Routemaster buses \u2013 over half the weight of the old Queen Mary \u2013 before a single banana is loaded.

Volume three, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-Powers-Earth-Political-1856-1863/dp/1476777284\">All the Powers of Earth</a>, concerns the late 1850s, years of division over slavery and the slide to civil war.</p> <p>\u201cI think I have an unusual and broad range of political experiences, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the beginning, with the anti-war movement when I was at the university, even before that I had participated in a rally at which I\u2019d seen Martin Luther King, down to the present.</p> <p>\u201cI certainly have a view on impeachment that\u2019s more than academic, having been the third and final witness in the Clinton impeachment and seeing everything firsthand, and everyone.</p> <p>\u201cSo I would say that experience, combined with my journalistic experience, creates a way of not only understanding history that makes it seem vivid and the conflicts understandable in a contemporary way, but that have to be translated into a method for researching and coming to the realities of what politics is.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re back to the how of the Lincoln biography, the why springing from a fascination instilled as a child in Chicago and an adult life writing for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/09/04/donald-trumps-republican-party-is-not-party-lincoln/\">Washington Post</a> and the New Yorker \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sidneyblumenthal\">the Guardian</a> \u2013 as well as working for the Clinton machine.</p> <p>Blumenthal is now 70. His Lincoln, the summit of his career, will run to five volumes. It tells the story of the president who came up in Illinois in the 1830s, served in Congress in the 1840s, shaped the Republican party in the 1850s, won the White House in 1860 and was killed after winning the civil war.</p> <p>It is also a political history of a riotous national scene which in volume three Lincoln doesn\u2019t enter until page 183. This could be daunting but Blumenthal\u2019s style is as propulsive as it is exhaustive. As before there are chapter-length portraits of key players: the Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner, Preston Brooks, <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Caning_of_Senator_Charles_Sumner.htm\">the South Carolina fire-eater who caned him</a>, and Thaddeus Stevens, radical Republican and implacable foe of slavery. As <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/september-october-2019/lincoln-the-politician/\">Lincoln scholars</a> have said, the result is a magisterial read, the familiar made fresh.</p> <p>\u201cIt requires relentless work,\u201d Blumenthal says, happy at the thought. \u201cFollowing footnotes to sources and then footnotes of the sources, all the way down, and reading everything with as fresh an eye as I can, and mining my own experience, which is different from if I were just an academic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"936f3c59dd204ab62105da34ed8cdff40aaeb6a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/936f3c59dd204ab62105da34ed8cdff40aaeb6a4/0_0_1514_1984/763.jpg\" alt=\"Blumenthal speaks outside court in February 1998, after testifying before a grand jury.\" width=\"763\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blumenthal speaks outside court in February 1998, after testifying before a grand jury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt helps in understanding the psychology and motives of people engaged in struggles for power and what the stakes are, having been involved in that.\u201d</p> <p>Such stakes have been high, notably so in the end of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/hitchens020899.htm\">a close friendship with the writer Christopher Hitchens</a>, over what was said or not said about Monica Lewinsky.</p> <p>Hitchens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-obituary\">died in 2011</a> so I chance a question about him, asking if such a painful experience might help Blumenthal put himself in Lincoln\u2019s shoes when, say, he writes about the perfidy of Senator John J Crittenden of Kentucky, or about defeat by the demagogue Stephen Douglas in the great Illinois Senate election of 1858.</p> <p>This time, Blumenthal doesn\u2019t smile.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had everything I have to say about Hitchens in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/may/25/politicalbooks.politics\">The Clinton Wars</a>.

Short answer, a lot. Volume four, Blumenthal says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t go to the assassination. Right now it goes to Gettysburg.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/july-3-1863\">battle</a> was won on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/us/at-gettysburg-a-battle-of-history-vs-modernity.html\">3 July 1863</a>, four months before Lincoln gave the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/04/abraham-lincoln-president-gettysburg-address\">address</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see how far it goes \u2026\u201d he pauses, slightly distracted, perhaps in his mind back in the scene he describes when I ask how he works: at his desk, books open, his wife at work in the office next door, facts to chase down, friends to call for discussion.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of it is written but I have to write a lot of the opening chapters. Well, I want to, I have to. I want to get to the bottom of the secession, of how it was done.</p> <p>\u201c[Volume] five is pretty much done,\u201d he adds, saying it will cover \u201cthe whole campaign of \u201964 \u2026 the triumph of Lincoln, the assassination, Reconstruction and Grant.\u201d He has not \u201creached the mountaintop\u201d, he says, but he can see it.

He was, in fact, illegitimate, and it was claimed he was foreign born and, therefore, not really an American.</p> <p>\u201cThese were not vague smears. These were highly massaged attacks done by campaign organizations and politicians against Fr\u00e9mont in order to discredit him and to discredit the new Republican party.

He chooses his words with care.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous environment that Lincoln\u2019s operating in,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of altogether a new party, which essentially has one platform plank, opposition against national slavery. People have histories in politics, and they\u2019ve warred against each other, Democrats, Whigs. People have become Know Nothings, abolitionists.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a happy family. Lincoln is kind of holding them together, and at the same time tamping down their worst instincts and attempts to impose their own views on the entire party which could sink the whole cause. It\u2019s a very hard project.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles.</p> <p>\u201cIt requires extraordinary leadership to hold a fractious party together.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the Palm restaurant at Dupont Circle, amid the buzz of Washington\u2019s political talk, Sidney Blumenthal is discussing John Brown\u2019s raid of 1859 and its place in his biography of Abraham Lincoln. He pauses, thinks, and smiles. \u201cI would say the investigation into Harper\u2019s Ferry conducted by Jefferson Davis was fairer than the Benghazi investigation.\u201d It\u2019s a pointed remark. In the 1990s, Blumenthal was an adviser to Bill Clinton during the impeachment crisis. In the 2000s, he was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in the race against Barack Obama. Now, as 2020 looms, he has become a bogeyman to Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party, a political Zelig lurking in every rightwing nightmare. His reference to Benghazi is to congressional hearings in 2015 in which he spent a day being questioned over his relationship with Hillary and the 2012 incident in Libya in which four Americans died. He walked out unbowed but when we first spoke about his work as a writer, in 2016, he was fresh from TV studios in which he had been asked more about Benghazi than anything in his life of Lincoln. When we discussed volume two, a year later, Blumenthal was mostly off the stage. But this time we meet amid dark hints from Republicans that the \u201cClinton attack dog\u201d, as Fox News gleefully calls him, had something to do with the Steele Dossier, the file of opposition research on Trump that fuels fever dreams on both sides of the aisle. Blumenthal skips over a question about that but his work on Lincoln is fueled by deep experience of all the brutalities of Washington. Volume three, All the Powers of Earth, concerns the late 1850s, years of division over slavery and the slide to civil war. \u201cI think I have an unusual and broad range of political experiences, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the beginning, with the anti-war movement when I was at the university, even before that I had participated in a rally at which I\u2019d seen Martin Luther King, down to the present. \u201cI certainly have a view on impeachment that\u2019s more than academic, having been the third and final witness in the Clinton impeachment and seeing everything firsthand, and everyone. \u201cSo I would say that experience, combined with my journalistic experience, creates a way of not only understanding history that makes it seem vivid and the conflicts understandable in a contemporary way, but that have to be translated into a method for researching and coming to the realities of what politics is.\u201d We\u2019re back to the how of the Lincoln biography, the why springing from a fascination instilled as a child in Chicago and an adult life writing for the Washington Post and the New Yorker \u2013 and the Guardian \u2013 as well as working for the Clinton machine. Blumenthal is now 70. His Lincoln, the summit of his career, will run to five volumes. It tells the story of the president who came up in Illinois in the 1830s, served in Congress in the 1840s, shaped the Republican party in the 1850s, won the White House in 1860 and was killed after winning the civil war. It is also a political history of a riotous national scene which in volume three Lincoln doesn\u2019t enter until page 183. This could be daunting but Blumenthal\u2019s style is as propulsive as it is exhaustive. As before there are chapter-length portraits of key players: the Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner, Preston Brooks, the South Carolina fire-eater who caned him, and Thaddeus Stevens, radical Republican and implacable foe of slavery. As Lincoln scholars have said, the result is a magisterial read, the familiar made fresh. \u201cIt requires relentless work,\u201d Blumenthal says, happy at the thought. \u201cFollowing footnotes to sources and then footnotes of the sources, all the way down, and reading everything with as fresh an eye as I can, and mining my own experience, which is different from if I were just an academic. \u201cIt helps in understanding the psychology and motives of people engaged in struggles for power and what the stakes are, having been involved in that.\u201d Such stakes have been high, notably so in the end of a close friendship with the writer Christopher Hitchens, over what was said or not said about Monica Lewinsky. Hitchens died in 2011 so I chance a question about him, asking if such a painful experience might help Blumenthal put himself in Lincoln\u2019s shoes when, say, he writes about the perfidy of Senator John J Crittenden of Kentucky, or about defeat by the demagogue Stephen Douglas in the great Illinois Senate election of 1858. This time, Blumenthal doesn\u2019t smile. \u201cI\u2019ve had everything I have to say about Hitchens in The Clinton Wars. I wrote about him.\u201d His next line stops me short. \u201cI\u2019m done. Thank you.\u201d Fortunately, he isn\u2019t ending the interview. He\u2019s just finished his lobster salad. \u2018I haven\u2019t reached the mountaintop\u201d Over coffee, we discuss what\u2019s left to be done on a political biography that will rival Robert Caro\u2019s LBJ in length and perhaps renown. Short answer, a lot. Volume four, Blumenthal says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t go to the assassination. Right now it goes to Gettysburg.\u201d The battle was won on 3 July 1863, four months before Lincoln gave the address. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how far it goes \u2026\u201d he pauses, slightly distracted, perhaps in his mind back in the scene he describes when I ask how he works: at his desk, books open, his wife at work in the office next door, facts to chase down, friends to call for discussion. \u201cA lot of it is written but I have to write a lot of the opening chapters. Well, I want to, I have to. I want to get to the bottom of the secession, of how it was done. \u201c[Volume] five is pretty much done,\u201d he adds, saying it will cover \u201cthe whole campaign of \u201964 \u2026 the triumph of Lincoln, the assassination, Reconstruction and Grant.\u201d He has not \u201creached the mountaintop\u201d, he says, but he can see it. Getting there will be \u201cthe greatest contribution I can make\u201d. Given that Blumenthal isn\u2019t an academic, I ask about influences outside the great corpus of Lincoln studies. \u201cTrying to recreate Lincoln\u2019s world,\u201d he says, \u201cinvolves creating all these characters that he was aware of, that he followed in real time, not knowing how anything was going to work out. So there\u2019s a novelistic aspect to it.\u201d All right. We\u2019re in the mid-19th century, the work is all-encompassing. What about Moby-Dick? \u201cMoby-Dick had a big impact on me when I read it in college. I write about it in volume two. It\u2019s about the Compromise of 1850\u201d \u2013 which dealt with territory acquired in the Mexican war of 1846-48, balancing slave states and free \u2013 \u201cwhich absorbed Melville. A lot of what happened there he turned into metaphors of both characters and forces of Moby-Dick, including a sense of the driven mania of [South Carolina senator and vice-president] John C Calhoun in Ahab. \u201cI ended that chapter with Ishmael: I alone have survived to tell the tale. That\u2019s Lincoln. He doesn\u2019t know it. He\u2019s been cast out. The whole thing has gone down, and he\u2019s cast out into central Illinois, and he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s there to develop. He\u2019s in his chrysalis \u2026 So, I\u2019m a big Moby-Dick fan.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have much time for books not related to his grand project but he says he did recently read Adam Gopnik\u2019s \u201clittle book on liberalism, which I wish could be taught everywhere\u201d. These days, any American historian is guaranteed to be asked what their new book might teach us about Donald Trump. Blumenthal has discussed the 45th president in light of the 16th almost as often as Trump has laid absurd claim to some sort of Lincolnian greatness. He\u2019s happy to go there again. After all, his second volume, Wrestling His Angel, contained a chapter on Millard Filmore, a notably awful president, entitled The Art of the Deal. In All the Powers of Earth there are chapters called Witch Hunt and The Birther Campaign. For a man who has denied being the first political operative to suggest a look into where Barack Obama was born, it is a provocative move. \u201cYeah, well,\u201d he says. \u201cJohn C Fr\u00e9mont, first candidate of the Republican party, the great explorer of the west, senator from California, a great naturalist, author, very wealthy, has a sketchy background. People aren\u2019t quite clear on it. His father was a French Canadian \u2026 he\u2019s accused of, worst thing of all, being a Catholic. He was, in fact, illegitimate, and it was claimed he was foreign born and, therefore, not really an American. \u201cThese were not vague smears. These were highly massaged attacks done by campaign organizations and politicians against Fr\u00e9mont in order to discredit him and to discredit the new Republican party. So, that was the first birther campaign, as it were.\u201d I suggest he\u2019ll get more questions about that. He continues. \u201cThe witch-hunt, of course, is a reference to the investigation after Harper\u2019s Ferry.\u201d Trump says special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation was the greatest witch-hunt of all. Blumenthal smiles again. In 1859, he says, investigators were \u201ctrying to attack all the anti-slavery figures in the Congress as tainted with conspiracy with John Brown. \u201cWell, maybe they colluded.\u201d \u2018The real politician\u2019 Blumenthal does not just allude to modern politics. He\u2019s still directly involved. In an afterword to volume three, he thanks the Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin for inviting him to Capitol Hill in January, to address new congressmen and women about Lincoln and the birth of a very different Republican party. \u201cIt was an interesting meeting for a lot of reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were actually interested in Lincoln, the real politician, and what he had done and how to do it. He had walked where they had literally walked. \u201cHow did he keep all these different factions together? How do you exercise leadership? How do you know when to step forward, when to step back, when to compromise, when not to compromise? When to follow your leader, when not to? All these things were relevant questions for the freshman Democrats I spoke with.\u201d As those freshmen debate whether to impeach a president, progressives among them are battling moderates for the soul of the party. I wonder if Blumenthal thinks Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar \u2013 or Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer \u2013 might profit from reading his book. He chooses his words with care. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous environment that Lincoln\u2019s operating in,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of altogether a new party, which essentially has one platform plank, opposition against national slavery. People have histories in politics, and they\u2019ve warred against each other, Democrats, Whigs. People have become Know Nothings, abolitionists. \u201cThis is not a happy family. Lincoln is kind of holding them together, and at the same time tamping down their worst instincts and attempts to impose their own views on the entire party which could sink the whole cause. It\u2019s a very hard project.\u201d He smiles. \u201cIt requires extraordinary leadership to hold a fractious party together.\u201d",

The <em>Observer</em> has long argued that a referendum on a negotiated exit versus the status quo is ultimately the only way to resolve this. Asking voters to decide only on the basis of a yes/no question, with no concrete Brexit plan on the table, could never have imbued a vote to leave the EU with sufficient democratic legitimacy. The fact that parliament has repeatedly rejected the withdrawal agreement, which contained all the real-world trade-offs that the Leave campaigns denied ever existed, only provides further impetus.

Mouth them, like some florid incantation: Sugar. Skin. Iberico. Char. Siu. It is not just char siu, that boisterous Cantonese way with roasted pork, involving the aromatics of five spice punched up with fermented bean curd and honey. It is char siu fashioned from Iberico pork, prized for its thick gilding of glistening, ivory fat. No, it\u2019s more than that. It is Iberico char siu with a crisp, sugared skin. Some of you, the pork-eating ones obviously, may feel you need this in your life. I need this in my life.</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://tearoom.bar/\" title=\"\">Wun\u2019s Tea Room and Bar</a> on a corner site in London\u2019s Soho, they serve it just above room temperature and so well rested, it seems to dissolve obligingly on the tongue, leaving just a gust of savoury piggyness and sweet shop sugar, as if whispering, \u201cDo not forget me.\u201d I take another piece, and another. A serving costs \u00a314.80 \u2013 every single price ends with 80p \u2013 which is a few quid more than you\u2019ll pay in Chinatown, over on the other side of Shaftesbury Avenue. Fair enough.

For decades Chinese food in Britain meant Cantonese food, often slicked in addictively sweet sauces, because a significant number of the chefs responsible for cooking it had come here from Hong Kong. With the opening up of China over the past few years, we became aware that it\u2019s a country of many provinces, each with their own distinct cooking style.</p> <p>So we rolled our eyes at the apparently banal familiarities of Cantonese and babbled excitedly instead about the fire and punch of the food of Sichuan or Hunan. We cooed over steaming hot pots and skewered meats crusted with chilli and cumin and ribbon noodles from Xinjiang. I say \u201cwe\u201d. I mean, I did that. I babbled a lot. The expansion of the Chinese food experience in the UK has been thrilling. I have become skilled at picking through heaps of dried red chillies in search of the fragrant joys within. I have been serious and committed.</p> <p>It was inevitable, therefore, that somebody would decide it was time to swing the pendulum back towards applauding the many virtues of the food of Canton, which is what owners Z He and Alex Peffly have done here. Pass through the upstairs tea room with its artfully distressed brickwork, and head into the basement with its down-lit cocktail bar and its jade green walls and its midcentury modern music cabinet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbe34744012c61e5ee304573fa51dec4b332f8d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbe34744012c61e5ee304573fa51dec4b332f8d0/35_1_2863_2364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Sprightly\u2019: peanut and noodle salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"826\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sprightly\u2019: peanut and noodle salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhana/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the table you will find a drinks menu in the form of a 12-page newspaper. It\u2019s tightly printed, graphically excitable and frankly baffling. There\u2019s a bunch of cocktails, with names that read like word spaghetti: Devilwood and Aged Tangerine, or Mango and Sago, or Salted Lime and Rice? Nope. No idea. There\u2019s a list of Chinese beers with their own thrilling titles: North Cloud Yunnan black lager or Monkey King amber ale. There\u2019s another of whisky, a section of baijiu, their own rice wines, gin and tea. There\u2019s a lot of tea, and a ceremony to go with it. Apparently, every single beverage comes direct from China. Donald Trump would hate it. So there\u2019s that. They offer a gin gimlet. I ask for one made with vodka, but they can\u2019t do that because they have no vodka. Fair enough. It\u2019s not bad if a little sweet.</p> <p>The food menu is a paper checklist, and relatively short. I set to work with a pencil, tongue clasped between teeth in concentration. The result is a mixed experience. The highs are very high indeed. I will return for these dishes, probably by myself so I don\u2019t have to share them. Alongside the char siu are \u201cwind shelter\u201d fried chilli sardines. The crisp-skinned fish rest in a heap of dried red chillies and a golden crumb of salty deep-fried garlic. You eat them and worry that your breath will scare away small children the next day. Then you realise that being scared is character-building for small children, so you don\u2019t care.</p> <p>Their \u201cfinger licking\u201d barbecue beef spare ribs are broad flat slices, sawn through the bone (in a way familiar from Korean barbecue). They are heavily sauced, all dark sweet soy stickiness, with huge bone-nibblage potential. You will indeed lick your fingers, because they are impossible to manage with chopsticks. The star dish, and the most expensive at \u00a318.80, is \u201cMy gran\u2019s secret recipe sour plum braised duck\u201d, which is a serious come-on but justified. It\u2019s a big steaming bowl of soft meat and crumbling potatoes in a savoury gravy that you\u2019ll want to dab behind your ears. We have rice, piled with pieces of fried lardo and shallots and served in a claypot so hot the rice is starting to crisp at the bottom. Scraping down there with a spoon becomes a mission. I am determined to complete it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"238554999483718d5f501871a7a49ee3b0b04a14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/238554999483718d5f501871a7a49ee3b0b04a14/292_0_1944_2430/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Heavy on friable pastry, light on custard\u2019: egg custard tarts.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Heavy on friable pastry, light on custard\u2019: egg custard tarts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhana/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everything delights. The skewers here \u2013 a few trimmed green beans, lined up to look like a raft, a curl of chicken skin, some weirdly unfatty lamb belly \u2013 feel like an afterthought and are not particularly good value at \u00a32.80 each. Whole prawns wrapped in spring roll pastry, deep fried and served with a wasabi mayonnaise, are a little greasy. And brussels sprouts in a bland sauce are a reminder of the days when this vegetable was a cruel and unusual punishment meted out to kids. There is, however, a sprightly salad of peanut and crisped noodles to take away the taste.</p> <p>We finish with their egg custard tarts, which are heavy on friable pastry, light on custard and not entirely worth hanging around for. Pop down to one of Soho\u2019s ice-cream parlours instead.</p> <p>Service is cheery if haphazard. Order your dishes in batches, otherwise they will throw everything at you at once. And the cocktail bar doesn\u2019t seem able to keep up with the kitchen; our drinks are ordered long before we order the food, but turn up five minutes after it arrives. That said, compared to most of the waiters working the rooms over on Gerrard Street, where customers are regarded as a dreary inconvenience to be tolerated, those at Wun\u2019s are a delight. Plus, there\u2019s the sugar skin Iberico char siu. Though I may already have mentioned that.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>A short stroll away from Wun\u2019s, over on the newly reconditioned piazza at the east end of Gerrard Street is Jinli. It\u2019s named after a famous street in Chengdu and accordingly much of the menu is Sichuan, boldly executed. Go with enough friends to explore the lengthy list of dry pot dishes, and the whole sea bass with chilli sauce. Unlike many of Chinatown\u2019s restaurants, it\u2019s a light, bright, high-ceilinged space <em><a href=\"https://www.jinli.co.uk/en/\">jinli.co.uk</a></em>.</p> <p>The Photographers\u2019 Gallery in London\u2019s Soho is staging \u2018Feast for the Eyes\u2019, an exhibition, previously staged in New York, examining the history of food in photography. The show, which includes work by Man Ray, Cindy Sherman, Weegee and Martin Parr, stretches from food in fine art photography through commercial and scientific images to journalism and fashion.

      "bodyText": "Wun\u2019s Tea Room and Bar 23 Greek Street, London W1D 4DZ (020 8017 9888). Snacks and small plates \u00a32.80-\u00a39.80, larger dishes \u00a311.80-\u00a318.80, desserts \u00a34.80-\u00a35.80, wines from \u00a322.80 It is tempting to shove just five words at you and leave it at that: sugar skin Iberico char siu. Mouth them, like some florid incantation: Sugar. Skin. Iberico. Char. Siu. It is not just char siu, that boisterous Cantonese way with roasted pork, involving the aromatics of five spice punched up with fermented bean curd and honey. It is char siu fashioned from Iberico pork, prized for its thick gilding of glistening, ivory fat. No, it\u2019s more than that. It is Iberico char siu with a crisp, sugared skin. Some of you, the pork-eating ones obviously, may feel you need this in your life. I need this in my life. At Wun\u2019s Tea Room and Bar on a corner site in London\u2019s Soho, they serve it just above room temperature and so well rested, it seems to dissolve obligingly on the tongue, leaving just a gust of savoury piggyness and sweet shop sugar, as if whispering, \u201cDo not forget me.\u201d I take another piece, and another. A serving costs \u00a314.80 \u2013 every single price ends with 80p \u2013 which is a few quid more than you\u2019ll pay in Chinatown, over on the other side of Shaftesbury Avenue. Fair enough. It\u2019s better than the char siu available over there. Wun\u2019s, from the team behind steamed bao specialists Bun House, is a logical development of the UK\u2019s Chinese restaurant sector. For decades Chinese food in Britain meant Cantonese food, often slicked in addictively sweet sauces, because a significant number of the chefs responsible for cooking it had come here from Hong Kong. With the opening up of China over the past few years, we became aware that it\u2019s a country of many provinces, each with their own distinct cooking style. So we rolled our eyes at the apparently banal familiarities of Cantonese and babbled excitedly instead about the fire and punch of the food of Sichuan or Hunan. We cooed over steaming hot pots and skewered meats crusted with chilli and cumin and ribbon noodles from Xinjiang. I say \u201cwe\u201d. I mean, I did that. I babbled a lot. The expansion of the Chinese food experience in the UK has been thrilling. I have become skilled at picking through heaps of dried red chillies in search of the fragrant joys within. I have been serious and committed. It was inevitable, therefore, that somebody would decide it was time to swing the pendulum back towards applauding the many virtues of the food of Canton, which is what owners Z He and Alex Peffly have done here. Pass through the upstairs tea room with its artfully distressed brickwork, and head into the basement with its down-lit cocktail bar and its jade green walls and its midcentury modern music cabinet. On the table you will find a drinks menu in the form of a 12-page newspaper. It\u2019s tightly printed, graphically excitable and frankly baffling. There\u2019s a bunch of cocktails, with names that read like word spaghetti: Devilwood and Aged Tangerine, or Mango and Sago, or Salted Lime and Rice? Nope. No idea. There\u2019s a list of Chinese beers with their own thrilling titles: North Cloud Yunnan black lager or Monkey King amber ale. There\u2019s another of whisky, a section of baijiu, their own rice wines, gin and tea. There\u2019s a lot of tea, and a ceremony to go with it. Apparently, every single beverage comes direct from China. Donald Trump would hate it. So there\u2019s that. They offer a gin gimlet. I ask for one made with vodka, but they can\u2019t do that because they have no vodka. Fair enough. It\u2019s not bad if a little sweet. The food menu is a paper checklist, and relatively short. I set to work with a pencil, tongue clasped between teeth in concentration. The result is a mixed experience. The highs are very high indeed. I will return for these dishes, probably by myself so I don\u2019t have to share them. Alongside the char siu are \u201cwind shelter\u201d fried chilli sardines. The crisp-skinned fish rest in a heap of dried red chillies and a golden crumb of salty deep-fried garlic. You eat them and worry that your breath will scare away small children the next day. Then you realise that being scared is character-building for small children, so you don\u2019t care. Their \u201cfinger licking\u201d barbecue beef spare ribs are broad flat slices, sawn through the bone (in a way familiar from Korean barbecue). They are heavily sauced, all dark sweet soy stickiness, with huge bone-nibblage potential. You will indeed lick your fingers, because they are impossible to manage with chopsticks. The star dish, and the most expensive at \u00a318.80, is \u201cMy gran\u2019s secret recipe sour plum braised duck\u201d, which is a serious come-on but justified. It\u2019s a big steaming bowl of soft meat and crumbling potatoes in a savoury gravy that you\u2019ll want to dab behind your ears. We have rice, piled with pieces of fried lardo and shallots and served in a claypot so hot the rice is starting to crisp at the bottom. Scraping down there with a spoon becomes a mission. I am determined to complete it. Not everything delights. The skewers here \u2013 a few trimmed green beans, lined up to look like a raft, a curl of chicken skin, some weirdly unfatty lamb belly \u2013 feel like an afterthought and are not particularly good value at \u00a32.80 each. Whole prawns wrapped in spring roll pastry, deep fried and served with a wasabi mayonnaise, are a little greasy. And brussels sprouts in a bland sauce are a reminder of the days when this vegetable was a cruel and unusual punishment meted out to kids. There is, however, a sprightly salad of peanut and crisped noodles to take away the taste. We finish with their egg custard tarts, which are heavy on friable pastry, light on custard and not entirely worth hanging around for. Pop down to one of Soho\u2019s ice-cream parlours instead. Service is cheery if haphazard. Order your dishes in batches, otherwise they will throw everything at you at once. And the cocktail bar doesn\u2019t seem able to keep up with the kitchen; our drinks are ordered long before we order the food, but turn up five minutes after it arrives. That said, compared to most of the waiters working the rooms over on Gerrard Street, where customers are regarded as a dreary inconvenience to be tolerated, those at Wun\u2019s are a delight. Plus, there\u2019s the sugar skin Iberico char siu. Though I may already have mentioned that. News bites A short stroll away from Wun\u2019s, over on the newly reconditioned piazza at the east end of Gerrard Street is Jinli. It\u2019s named after a famous street in Chengdu and accordingly much of the menu is Sichuan, boldly executed. Go with enough friends to explore the lengthy list of dry pot dishes, and the whole sea bass with chilli sauce. Unlike many of Chinatown\u2019s restaurants, it\u2019s a light, bright, high-ceilinged space jinli.co.uk. The Photographers\u2019 Gallery in London\u2019s Soho is staging \u2018Feast for the Eyes\u2019, an exhibition, previously staged in New York, examining the history of food in photography. The show, which includes work by Man Ray, Cindy Sherman, Weegee and Martin Parr, stretches from food in fine art photography through commercial and scientific images to journalism and fashion.

The latest move will add an additional 10% to the price of lobsters headed for China, which already face 25% penalty tariffs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/05/us-and-china-agree-to-reopen-trade-talks-in-october\">US and China agree to reopen trade talks in October</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One clear winner of the trade war has been Canada, which has exported twice as many live lobsters in 2019 as the previous year, according to industry figures.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just picked up a lot more of the market than we had before,\u201d said Geoff Irvine, head of the Lobster Council of Canada. \u201cAnd at the same time, the market is growing, so it\u2019s a twofold story.\u201d</p> <p>Canada was well-positioned for market dominance. It was already the largest lobster supplier in the world, and has signed free trade agreements with Europe, the US and a number of Asian countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p> <p>The booming fortunes of Canada\u2019s lobster industry have also have been aided by a changing climate. The waters around Nova Scotia, where the bulk of lobster are hauled from the Atlantic Ocean, have <a href=\"http://dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/publications/soto-rceo/2018/atlantic-ecosystems-ecosystemes-atlantiques/index-eng.html#box1\">warmed slightly in recent years</a>, dramatically increasing the number of lobsters that can be harvested.</p> <p>As a result of global demand, Canada\u2019s lobster market share is expected to continue its blistering growth, surpassing more than $3bn by 2025 \u2013 triple the figure for 2010 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/ea-ae/economic-analysis/outlook-to-2027-perspectives-jusqu-en-2027-eng.html\">according to figures</a> from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Much of the demand is projected to come from Asia.</p> <p>\u201cNine years ago, China didn\u2019t buy any lobster,\u201d said Irvine. But rapidly growing middle and affluent classes in the country have spurred demand for luxury shellfish.</p> <p>Canadian fishermen are hesitant to weigh in on the trade war, fearful they might be caught in the crossfire \u2013 and for good reason: Canada has its own problems with China.</p> <p>As recently as last year, talks of a free trade pact between China and Canada <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/18/canada-china-trade-deal-huawei\">looked promising</a>. But diplomatic relations between the two countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/16/canadians-detained-in-china-charged-with-espionage\">entered a deep freeze</a> following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/10/huawei-meng-wangzhou-bail-hearing-canada-china-response\">arrest of the telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou</a> in Vancouver at the request of the US.</p> <p>In recent months, China has sharply curtailed canola and pork markets imports from Canada, in a move largely seen as retribution for Meng\u2019s detention.</p> <p>And as the tariff war drives greater demand for live Canadian lobster, Irvine cautions against premature celebration. \u201cYou can\u2019t generalize in this industry. Even with the increased sales to China, it\u2019s meant less for other markets \u2013 which has affected people who are focused on those markets.\u201d </p> <p>But the effects of the trade war have been unavoidable south of the border: US lobster fishermen are struggling to stay afloat. </p> <p>Stephanie Nadeau, who runs the Lobster Company in Arundel, Maine, said she never experienced such bleak prospects.</p> <p>Over the past year, exports to China have ground to halt, forcing her to lay off seven employees \u2013 nearly half of her staff. \u201cWe have no market in China right now. None,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you want to go sell for nothing and you have a giant salesforce that can sit there and beat the phones all day, you\u2019re not going to replace [the Chinese market],\u201d she said.</p> <p>In previous years, the US and Canada exported roughly the same amount of lobster to China. By June this year, Maine, America\u2019s largest lobster exporter, was supplying just 15% of the toothsome crustacean, while Canada accounted for 85%.</p> <p>In the first six months of 2019, US lobster exports to China dropped to just 2.2m compared to 12m lb in the same period in 2018.</p> <p>More than a year into the trade war, US lobster fishermen and women can see no end to their economic pains \u2013 and little sign that their plight has even been recognized by their own government. \u201cHow long am I supposed to sit here and not make any money?\u201d asked Nadeau.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Long hours, rolling ocean swells, and the occasional spring snowstorm are all part of the job for Francis Morrissey. \u201cIt\u2019s bred into you from the time you\u2019re a child: you either like the ocean or you don\u2019t,\u201d said the fisherman and business owner from the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. \u201cEven when I\u2019m in the office, I wish I was out there.\u201d In recent months, Morrissey has had even more reason to head back out on to the water: prices are at record levels and demand is only growing as Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China undercuts America\u2019s own lobster industry, giving an unexpected boost to fishermen north of the border. The US lobster industry was dealt a fresh blow in July, when China announced new tariffs on live lobsters, as part of a broader levy on exports from the US. The latest move will add an additional 10% to the price of lobsters headed for China, which already face 25% penalty tariffs. One clear winner of the trade war has been Canada, which has exported twice as many live lobsters in 2019 as the previous year, according to industry figures. \u201cWe\u2019ve just picked up a lot more of the market than we had before,\u201d said Geoff Irvine, head of the Lobster Council of Canada. \u201cAnd at the same time, the market is growing, so it\u2019s a twofold story.\u201d Canada was well-positioned for market dominance. It was already the largest lobster supplier in the world, and has signed free trade agreements with Europe, the US and a number of Asian countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The booming fortunes of Canada\u2019s lobster industry have also have been aided by a changing climate. The waters around Nova Scotia, where the bulk of lobster are hauled from the Atlantic Ocean, have warmed slightly in recent years, dramatically increasing the number of lobsters that can be harvested. As a result of global demand, Canada\u2019s lobster market share is expected to continue its blistering growth, surpassing more than $3bn by 2025 \u2013 triple the figure for 2010 \u2013 according to figures from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Much of the demand is projected to come from Asia. \u201cNine years ago, China didn\u2019t buy any lobster,\u201d said Irvine. But rapidly growing middle and affluent classes in the country have spurred demand for luxury shellfish. Canadian fishermen are hesitant to weigh in on the trade war, fearful they might be caught in the crossfire \u2013 and for good reason: Canada has its own problems with China. As recently as last year, talks of a free trade pact between China and Canada looked promising. But diplomatic relations between the two countries entered a deep freeze following the arrest of the telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the request of the US. In recent months, China has sharply curtailed canola and pork markets imports from Canada, in a move largely seen as retribution for Meng\u2019s detention. And as the tariff war drives greater demand for live Canadian lobster, Irvine cautions against premature celebration. \u201cYou can\u2019t generalize in this industry. Even with the increased sales to China, it\u2019s meant less for other markets \u2013 which has affected people who are focused on those markets.\u201d But the effects of the trade war have been unavoidable south of the border: US lobster fishermen are struggling to stay afloat. Stephanie Nadeau, who runs the Lobster Company in Arundel, Maine, said she never experienced such bleak prospects. Over the past year, exports to China have ground to halt, forcing her to lay off seven employees \u2013 nearly half of her staff. \u201cWe have no market in China right now. None,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless you want to go sell for nothing and you have a giant salesforce that can sit there and beat the phones all day, you\u2019re not going to replace [the Chinese market],\u201d she said. In previous years, the US and Canada exported roughly the same amount of lobster to China. By June this year, Maine, America\u2019s largest lobster exporter, was supplying just 15% of the toothsome crustacean, while Canada accounted for 85%. In the first six months of 2019, US lobster exports to China dropped to just 2.2m compared to 12m lb in the same period in 2018. More than a year into the trade war, US lobster fishermen and women can see no end to their economic pains \u2013 and little sign that their plight has even been recognized by their own government. \u201cHow long am I supposed to sit here and not make any money?\u201d asked Nadeau.",

Familiar because we\u2019re accustomed to the fact-based crime movie formula, but fresh because we don\u2019t usually see it played out with women. It\u2019s 2007 and Destiny (Constance Wu) has discovered that the life of a stripper isn\u2019t quite as glamorous or as lucrative as she thought. The competition is fierce, the clientele is either creepy (\u201cWhat did daddy do to you?\u201d) or racist (\u201cHey, come here Lucy Liu!\u201d) and by the time the men she works for have taken their cut, the money is barely adequate. It doesn\u2019t help that she\u2019s not quite sure what to do or just how to move her body to make more money, something she\u2019s keenly aware of when she meets Ramona (Jennifer Lopez).</p> <p>Ramona is everything Destiny isn\u2019t: she\u2019s in control of her sexuality, her business, and the men she\u2019s trying to impress. She\u2019s also more than happy to take Destiny under her wing to show her some more dextrous moves, and the pair become fast, financially fruitful friends, working the champagne room together, earning more than ever before. But then something happens: the recession. Destiny gets pregnant, leaves the club and years later tries to re-enter the workforce. But her inexperience outside of stripping makes her largely unemployable and so she returns to the place she knows best. Without excessive overspending from Wall Street\u2019s most aggressive earners, it\u2019s a bleaker landscape, and once she\u2019s reunited with Ramona, she learns about fishing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_dfc0iqmig\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P_dfc0iqmig?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>To fish is to leave the four walls of the strip club and bring in guys from outside, to fool them into thinking they\u2019re genuinely interested before drugging them, stealing their account details and racking up exorbitant credit card bills.

Even when films have focused on strippers as something other than window dressing, they\u2019ve still been written and directed by men and have smoothed over rougher edges, turning them all into titillating one-note archetypes.

      "bodyText": "Tony Burke has given the strongest indication yet that Labor plans to push back against Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d agenda on welfare, as the government flags a national rollout of cashless debit cards. Just days after reviving the drug testing policy for Newstart recipients which failed to pass the last parliament, the prime minister has told Nine newspapers the government will extend its cashless debit card program, despite the auditor general finding it was \u201cunclear\u201d whether it had any positive impacts. Labor has so far taken a middle road approach to the cashless debit card program, but speaking to Sky News on Sunday the senior Labor frontbencher said it made life harder, not just for those assigned the card but for the communities they live in. \u201cLet me tell you a really quick local example as to how this cashless debit card creates real problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe already know all the challenges about the money provided through Newstart not being enough for people to be able to make ends meet. Suburbs like mine, the corner stores, the little small businesses, fruit and veg shops, butchers massively undercut the major supermarkets on a whole range of items. \u201cBut the cashless debit card says you can only go to those who\u2019ve signed up. So what does it mean? It means the government will be forcing people away from small businesses to buy products at a higher price, to make it harder for people to make ends meet. \u201c Those sorts of examples will be found with people who are not part of this system and retailers that are not part of it are more likely to be small businesses. So they punish the small businesses and they make cost of living even more difficult for the exact group of people who have more cost of living challenges than any other Australians.\u201d Labor caucus will meet early this week before announcing its final position. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to Linda Burney for the final announcement but it\u2019s pretty clear where we\u2019re headed on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of the government saying there are signs it has worked, I\u2019d say they ought to have a look at what the auditor general\u2019s had to say. The auditor general has been deeply critical of claims that this program is working.\u201d Australian Council of Social Service\u2019s director of policy, Jacqueline Phillips, said on Sunday: \u201cCashless debit is unnecessary, expensive, stigmatising and impractical, making it harder for people to buy second-hand goods. \u201cIt costs thousands per person to administer and many people feel humiliated when they have to pay with the card, especially in small towns. \u201cThis can compound the sense of shame many people feel about being unemployed when they are doing all they can to find paid work in today\u2019s competitive job market with one job available for every eight people looking. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the government is floating these ineffective, expensive policies in a misguided attempt to distract from the urgent need to increase Newstart, which is widely supported and would provide the economy with much-needed stimulus.\u201d Although the government has announced it is reviving its drug testing policy and expanding the cashless debit card, it has not moved to increase the Newstart rate, despite conservatives such as the former prime minister John Howard admitting the payment was too low. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, who remains focused on delivering an operating surplus in next year\u2019s budget, said the allowance, which has not increased in real terms in more than two decades, was never meant as \u201ca replacement wage\u201d and said the government believed it to be \u201cappropriate\u201d. \u201cIn the lead-up to the last election, there were two alternative agendas and neither party promised to increase the Newstart allowance,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cLabor went in with $387bn in higher taxes and not one cent of the $387bn in higher taxes was [for] Newstart. \u201c \u2026 We believe that the rate of the Newstart allowance is appropriate \u2026 But we also believe that those Australians who are unemployed, who are on Newstart, and who have a drug addiction problem, that this drug addiction problem is a barrier to them getting back into the workforce.

      "bodyText": "The Victorian government will put in $3m for crisis response to support asylum seekers hit by federal government cuts. In 2017 the federal government announced it was tightening requirements for the status resolution support services payments for asylum seekers on bridging visas, which came into effect in 2018. The payment was about $35 a day for just over 13,000 people, and also provided access to trauma and torture counselling services and case management support. Advocates said the restrictions cut the number of people on the program to about 5,000. A report last year found the change put close to 80% of asylum seekers who were on the payment at risk of homelessness. In April the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre reported a huge surge in people seeking help for food and accommodation because of the changes. On Sunday the Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, announced $3m in funding to cover health and support services for 6,000 asylum seekers across the state. It had given $600,000 last year. The money will be distributed to the Red Cross, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, Monash Health, Improving and Promoting Community Health, Cabrini Refugee and Asylum Seeker Hub, Foundation House and Refugee Legal. \u201cThis funding will ensure people who have already endured great trauma and hardship and are seeking asylum in Victoria get the specialist care they need,\u201d Foley said. \u201cWhile this can\u2019t address every need or resolve the larger uncertainty of waiting for a visa outcome, we hope this support can relieve some of the pressures faced by those seeking asylum.\u201d Last year a Refugee Council of Australia report found the cuts, which were aimed at moving refugees off the payment and into employment, simply shifted the cost from the federal government to state governments and charity organisations. It was estimated the cuts would cost state and territory governments between $80m and $120m a year in additional funding for health, corrective services and homelessness programs.",

      "bodyText": "Congress is investigating Donald Trump over a potential conflict of interest involving increased US military spending at Prestwick airport near Glasgow and visits to his Trump Turnberry resort, according to reports. The house oversight committee has been investigating whether increasing expenditure at the airport and allegations of US military personnel being offered discount deals at Trump\u2019s Ayrshire golf resort represent a violation of the US constitution, Politico reported. Elijah Cummings, the chairman of the committee, wrote in June to the then acting secretary of defence, Patrick Shanahan, to raise \u201cserious conflict of interest concerns\u201d about Trump making money from military trips to Scotland. According to the news website, the letter said US military spending at Prestwick, the closest airport to the resort, appeared to have \u201cincreased substantially since the election\u201d. It follows reports of the airport offering \u201ccut-price rooms for select passengers and crew\u201d, along with free rounds of golf at Turnberry for US military staff and civilian air crews. The air force confirmed that seven crew from a C-17 aircraft stayed at Turnberry in March. The committee is demanding to see all the financial documents from the US Department of Defense relating to Trump Turnberry, in addition to details of all communications between the two parties. However, reports from the US suggest there has not yet been any response. \u201cTwo years before the 2016 election, President Trump spent hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and renovate the Turnberry golf course in Scotland,\u201d said the letter, which was also signed by the Democrat congressman, Jamie Raskin. \u201cTo date, the property has continued to suffer financial losses and has not turned a profit for the president of his companies. \u201cThe airport closest to the Trump Turnberry golf course \u2013 Glasgow Prestwick airport \u2013 has been viewed as integral to the golf course\u2019s financial success, yet it too has lost millions of dollars every year since its purchase by the Scottish government in 2013.\u201d It cited Defence Logistics Agency records showing 629 fuel purchase orders worth $11m since October 2017. \u201cGiven the president\u2019s continued financial stake in his Scotland golf courses, these reports raise questions about the president\u2019s potential receipt of US or foreign government emoluments in violation of the US constitution and raise other serious conflict of interest concerns. \u201cIn order to fulfil its responsibilities under the constitution, the committee is seeking information related to expenditures at both Prestwick airport and the president\u2019s nearby Scotland golf resorts.\u201d CNN reported that a Democratic committee aide said the defense department had not cooperated with the investigation or produced any of the requested documents. The US defense department said in a statement to the New York Times that a stopover of a US air force C-17 and its crew at Trump Turnberry in March 2019 had not been unusual, and they had \u201cused the closest available and least expensive accommodations to the airfield within the crew\u2019s allowable hotel rates\u201d. Both Trump Turnberry and the airport have operated at significant losses in recent years, with the Scottish government putting Prestwick up for sale after taking it into public ownership in 2013.",
