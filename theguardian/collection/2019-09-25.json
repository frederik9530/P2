It hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cNobody said that we could change the, uh, the backstop that is,\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cBut has it been done?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cThat is now under serious negotiation.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201ct\u2019s under discussion but when I talk to people in European capitals. They are very sceptical. You\u2019ll get anything like what you want.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cWell, it is certainly true, Robert, that uh, the British negotiating position has been undermined by the so-called surrender bill. Well not \u2018so called\u2019 It is a surrender bill. Uh, the, the, the bill that says that we\u2019d have to rule out no deal. They\u2019ve tried to wreck our negotiating position, but we\u2019re not going to let them do it,</p> \n  <p>We\u2019re going to get on and negotiate a deal if we possibly can. And if we can\u2019t get up to you, then we\u2019re going to come out of the EU on October the 31st come what may.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cBut you did say something that I thought was very interesting to MPs, which is, that you believe now that EU are agreeing to some mechanism. You\u2019ve got it, the principle of consent whereby whatever arrangements, if any arrangements to replace the backstop are agreed, they will be a way for Northern Ireland to get out of those arrangements. How would that work?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cWell, I mean, this is, this is kind of where the rubber is hitting the road. Okay. The, the, the, the, the problem with the backstop is, is it, it\u2019s the, it\u2019s the arrangement, right?</p> \n  <p>Exactly. It\u2019s the arrangement that keeps the UK locked in the, uh, EU\u2019s legal order, the customs union and the single market with the EU having the say about our ability to exit. That\u2019s the problem with it. And it\u2019s just never going to go through the House of Commons. So we need to get rid of that.</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cBut do you get any sense, you were saying to some MPs that you think the EU will move on that. Genuinely?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cYes, I do. And they already genuinely have moved in the sense that they\u2019re willing to consider other ways that allow us to work with our Irish friends to accomplish several things. Number one, we need to avoid any kind of border checks.\u201d</p> \n  <p>[...]</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201c...the attorney general said today that you would abide by the so called Benn act, which says if you can\u2019t get a deal, you\u2019ve got to write to the EU requesting an extension. So you\u2019re going to write this letter, are you?</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cWell we\u2019re going to go for a deal\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cNo! No! He said you would abide by this law, that means you would have to write the letter if there is no deal?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cThat of course only kicks in. If we fail to get a deal\u201d</p> \n  <p>RP: \u201cBut you\u2019re conceding there\u2019s a reasonable prospect you\u2019re not going to get a deal.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cAnd under these circumstances, what I can say to you is that we will respect the law and we will come out on October the 31st\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cBut those two statements, many would say are completely incompatible\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cWell we will respect the law and we will come out on October 31st\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cHow?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ:</strong> \u201cWell.

A few hours later <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> chose exactly the same hyper-aggressive approach. Having been found to have acted unlawfully by the supreme court, some humility might have been expected. But instead Johnson sounded utterly unrepentant, and instead his speech amounted highly-charged, after-dinner rant about Labour and the rest of the opposition, whom he accused of blocking Brexit.</p> \n  <p>Tory MPs loved it. And if the Number 10 strategy at the moment is all about depicting Johnson as a tribune of the Brexit-loving masses, taking on the courts and parliament, perhaps at one point, when the election comes, it will work. </p> \n  <p>But what was striking was that this appears to be about the only strategy Johnson has. Today Johnson had absolutely nothing to say about his Brexit negotiating strategy and he had absolutely nothing to say about his strategy for getting legislation through parliament. Jeremy Corbyn said the speech amounted to \u201c10 minutes of bluster\u201d, and he was right. All the alpha-male belligerent bravado was cover for the fact that the PM seems to be running out of options.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson challenged the opposition parties to call a vote of no confidence if they want a general election.</strong> He said he would make time for a motion tabled by a minor opposition party, not just Labour, to be debated. But the opposition parties want a guarantee that there will not be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October first, and so it is hard to see this offer being taken up.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson accused the opposition of being afraid of facing the public. </strong>This was undemocratic, he claimed. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not just that this parliament is in gridlock, paralysed and refusing to deliver the priorities of the people. It\u2019s not just unable to move forward. It\u2019s worse than that \u2013 out of sheer selfishness and political cowardice members opposite are unwilling to move aside and give the people a say.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he wanted to offer voters a \u201clife after Brexit\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The public don\u2019t want another referendum \u2013 what they want and what they demand, is that we honour the promise we made to the voters to respect the first referendum.

She asked for an assurance that, if troops were going to be sent to the Gulf for military action, that the Commons would get a vote.</p> \n  <p><strong>Dominic Raab</strong>, the foreign secretary, claimed that there were no such plans. Responding to Thornberry, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Thornberry] talked whether the UK would be sending troops to Saudia Arabia. There has been no suggestion of that at all. It is simply wrong for her to say it. What has been said is that the US is sending troops to Saudi Arabia to make sure that Saudi can protect itself from further attacks, or repeats of the attacks Aramco.</p> \n   <p>We have said that we would consider a request that we\u2019ve received for support in relation to air defences.

But we need to be absolutely unwavering and clear in our resolve that the only way that will happen is if Iran steps up and starts to meet its responsibilities.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The suggestion that the UK was considering sending troops to Saudia Arabia, emerged from what Boris Johnson said when he spoke to reporters on his flight to New York recently, although the headlines about troops being despatched (see <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/british-troops-could-deployed-saudi-20148091\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9983177/boris-johnson-troops-gulf-iran/\">here</a>) did not necessarily match what was actually being proposed.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8ba36d8f081108db9bcb2c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-25T17:31:37.544Z\">6.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson expected to challenge opposition parties to table no-confidence motion</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>According to a leak of what Boris Johnson is due to say in his statement to MPs shortly, he will challenge the opposition parties to table a motion of no confidence in the government.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/25/what-happens-next-in-parliament-after-supreme-court-ruling\">full guide is here</a>, but here are the answers to a few key questions: </p> \n  <h2><strong>What\u2019s happening with parliament on Wednesday?</strong></h2> \n  <p>The president of the UK\u2019s highest court, Lady Hale, announced on Tuesday that \u201cparliament has not been prorogued\u201d. The unanimous judgment of all 11 justices was that it was for parliament - and particularly the speakers of both houses - to decide what to do next. Commons Speaker John Bercow has already said that parliament must be reconvened as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/bercow-mps-return-urgent-supreme-court-ruling-suspension-parliament\">\u201cmatter of urgency\u201d</a>and that MPs will sit at 11.30am. The usual Wednesday session of prime minister\u2019s questions would not take place, he said, although there would be opportunities for MPs to hold the Government to account.</p> \n  <h2>What does it mean for Brexit?</h2> \n  <p>Corbyn was meeting the leaders of the Scottish Nationalists, Lib Dems and other opposition parties last night to work out how to exert maximum pressure to achieve their number one goal: making sure Johnson cannot escape the legal obligation set out in the Benn-Burt bill to delay Brexit if he has not reached a deal of any description by 19 October. Johnson has always insisted<strong> </strong>he will not request an extension of article 50 and may be hoping that the EU summit on 17 October will provide a breakthrough.</p> \n  <p>Government ministers have repeatedly dodged questions about whether they think there are loopholes they could use to avoid complying with the Benn legislation. But it would risk another potentially humiliating legal battle with the courts if Johnson chose to go down that route. In a hint he could have another go at suspending parliament he said there was a \u201cgood case for getting on with a Queen\u2019s speech\u201d.</p> \n  <h2>Does any of this make an election more likely?</h2> \n  <p>Johnson would like to have an election as soon as possible, but he has failed to force the necessary legal instrument through parliament. As he put it, \u201cwe have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to have an election\u201d. The opposition parties don\u2019t want an election until Johnson has asked for the Brexit extension. Their calculation is that Johnson will be weakened by doing so because he has made delivering Brexit on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d the totem of his prime ministership. They can therefore go to the country portraying him as someone who has failed to deliver his promises.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/25/what-happens-next-in-parliament-after-supreme-court-ruling\">What happens next in parliament after supreme court ruling?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8aeb5b8f08fbb0c171af03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-lyons\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-25T04:59:24.852Z\">5.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog.</p> \n  <p>Yesterday was a fairly extraordinary day on both sides of the Atlantic.

Quite the day for brash, blonde world leaders.</p> \n  <p>The Supreme Court verdict has meant that Johnson has had to cut short his visit to New York, where he was attending the United Nations general assembly. He is due to arrive in London around lunchtime on Wednesday after an overnight flight. </p> \n  <p>Parliament will resume at 11:30am, with MPs returning to the House of Commons two weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/09/brexit-latest-news-eu-no-deal-bill-royal-assent-boris-johnson-parliament-politics-live\">it was suspended in chaotic scenes</a>. A government official in New York with the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/boris-johnson-flies-back-to-face-mps-fury-after-court-ruling\">said it was impossible to say whether Johnson would appear before the Commons</a>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI would anticipate there would be statements to the house, I\u2019m just not in a position to say what they will be on,\u201d the official said.</p> \n  <p>Downing Street suggested the prime minister would continue to push for a snap general election, while opposition parties attempted to inflict maximum embarrassment on Johnson.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn the coming days parliament is likely to be put on the spot to see if it will have an election or whether it will continue to keep the country in zombie-parliament stasis.

      "bodyText": "I will wrap this blog up now. The first Commons session since parliament was prorogued by prime minister Boris Johnson with the intention to keep it suspended for 5 weeks on September 9 was as intense as anticipated. Furious MPs confronted the PM, after the Supreme Court had found that the suspension had been \u201cunlawful\u201d. Boris Johnson and Jacob-Rees Mogg told MPs repeatedly that they believe the Supreme Court verdict to be \u201cwrong\u201d. Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn called for the PM\u2019s resignation and Plaid Cymru for his impeachment. The PM mocked the opposition for voting against a general election and No 10 Downing Street challenged them to table a motion of no confidence tonight or \u201cshut up\u201d. Tory MPs reacted with standing ovations to the PM\u2019s attack on the opposition front bench - which is, strictly speaking, forbidden in the Commons. Widespread condemnation erupted after Boris Johnson shrugged off emotional comments by an MP about the murder of remain-campaigner and Labour MP Jo Cox with the word \u201chumbug\u201d; shortly after, the PM said Cox was best remembered by getting Brexit done, which further fuelled the outrage. Various MPs and pundits clamoured for the elimination of inflammatory language in parliament, and pointed out examples where such language has incited violence and endangered MPS and their families. The shadow Brexit secretary Matthew Pennycook has resigned, citing his wish to campaign full time for remain in a second referendum and the imminent birth of his second child as factors. Jacob Rees-Mogg said he would be making an \u201cexciting announcement\u201d in the Commons tomorrow. That\u2019s everything from me, goodnight. This from the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges: And this from Tory MP Tobias Ellwood: The sentiment that the increasingly irresponsible use of hazardous language is endangering MPs, judges and democracy itself has pervaded the evening and is even being uttered by Tory MPs now, here by cabinet minister Nicky Morgan: Here my colleagues Heather Stewart and Kate Proctor with a summary of tonight\u2019s Commons debate. Boris Johnson addresses MPs after supreme court ruling and clashes with Corbyn \u2013 video What a night it\u2019s been. Dominic Grieve told Peston he found the PM \u201cterrifying\u201d tonight, who received standing ovations from Conservative MPs for what Grieve describes as \u201ctotal populism\u201d. Here a reaction from the former Labour leader Ed Miliband: The Commons session has now been adjourned. Boris Johnson has given ITV\u2019s Peston a pre-recorded interview, which has aired at 10:45pm. Here some excerpts from the transcript: Boris Johnson: \u201c60 days ago, nobody said that we could change the withdrawal agreement in the EU Treaty\u201d Robert Peston: \u201cBut you haven\u2019t changed it\u201d BJ: \u201cNobody said everybody \u2013 on the contrary\u2026Everybody around the EU. Now accepts that it must be changed\u201d RB: \u201cBut it may be changed. It hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d BJ: \u201cNobody said that we could change the, uh, the backstop that is,\u201d RP: \u201cBut has it been done?\u201d BJ: \u201cThat is now under serious negotiation.\u201d RP: \u201ct\u2019s under discussion but when I talk to people in European capitals. They are very sceptical. You\u2019ll get anything like what you want.\u201d BJ: \u201cWell, it is certainly true, Robert, that uh, the British negotiating position has been undermined by the so-called surrender bill. Well not \u2018so called\u2019 It is a surrender bill. Uh, the, the, the bill that says that we\u2019d have to rule out no deal. They\u2019ve tried to wreck our negotiating position, but we\u2019re not going to let them do it, We\u2019re going to get on and negotiate a deal if we possibly can. And if we can\u2019t get up to you, then we\u2019re going to come out of the EU on October the 31st come what may.\u201d RP: \u201cBut you did say something that I thought was very interesting to MPs, which is, that you believe now that EU are agreeing to some mechanism. You\u2019ve got it, the principle of consent whereby whatever arrangements, if any arrangements to replace the backstop are agreed, they will be a way for Northern Ireland to get out of those arrangements. How would that work?\u201d BJ: \u201cWell, I mean, this is, this is kind of where the rubber is hitting the road. Okay. The, the, the, the, the problem with the backstop is, is it, it\u2019s the, it\u2019s the arrangement, right? Exactly. It\u2019s the arrangement that keeps the UK locked in the, uh, EU\u2019s legal order, the customs union and the single market with the EU having the say about our ability to exit. That\u2019s the problem with it. And it\u2019s just never going to go through the House of Commons. So we need to get rid of that. RP: \u201cBut do you get any sense, you were saying to some MPs that you think the EU will move on that. Genuinely?\u201d BJ: \u201cYes, I do. And they already genuinely have moved in the sense that they\u2019re willing to consider other ways that allow us to work with our Irish friends to accomplish several things. Number one, we need to avoid any kind of border checks.\u201d [...] RP: \u201c...the attorney general said today that you would abide by the so called Benn act, which says if you can\u2019t get a deal, you\u2019ve got to write to the EU requesting an extension. So you\u2019re going to write this letter, are you? BJ: \u201cWell we\u2019re going to go for a deal\u201d RP: \u201cNo! No! He said you would abide by this law, that means you would have to write the letter if there is no deal?\u201d BJ: \u201cThat of course only kicks in. If we fail to get a deal\u201d RP: \u201cBut you\u2019re conceding there\u2019s a reasonable prospect you\u2019re not going to get a deal.\u201d BJ: \u201cAnd under these circumstances, what I can say to you is that we will respect the law and we will come out on October the 31st\u201d RP: \u201cBut those two statements, many would say are completely incompatible\u201d BJ: \u201cWell we will respect the law and we will come out on October 31st\u201d RP: \u201cHow?\u201d BJ: \u201cWell. Obviously we\u2019ve got some, some tough negotiations ahead and if you\u2019ll forgive me, I don\u2019t want to tip the hand of the UK government more than parliament is already required us to do so RP: \u201cThe only reason I have the pleasure of seeing you here today is because you had to come back [inaudible]\u201d BJ: \u201cNo I was coming back anyway\u201d RP: [inaudible] many hours earlier than you would have expected. BJ: \u201cI fulfilled my commitments in New York.\u201d Rees-Mogg just promised \u201can exciting announcement\u201d for tomorrow, and paraphrased the PM\u2019s infamous \u201cwhat\u2019s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander\u201d line - which originally referred to equal treatment of the Tory MPs who might vote down a new deal and the Tory rebels who lost their whip for defying the government a few weeks ago. And here an interesting comment from Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary, University of London: While a somewhat deflated debate rumbles on about the PM\u2019s conduct tonight and around the prorogation, I\u2019m turning my attention briefly to this from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby: Rees-Mogg now responds to a question by the shadow leader of the house Valerie Vaz, who quoted Rees-Mogg\u2019s alleged remark about the Supreme Court ruling representing a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. Rees-Mogg says this quote was attributed to him after a cabinet meeting, and that cabinet meetings are meant to be confidential, to much laughter. He says it\u2019s a reasonable thing to disagree with somebody while also respecting them, like it is the case with himself and Bercow, and repeats the PM\u2019s stance that he believes the judgment was \u201cwrong\u201d. This is what\u2019s on tomorrow\u2019s Common\u2019s agenda: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the House, is now making his business statement. He opens by picking up the topic of the evening: Language that can have dire consequences for members of the house and their families. Says while he personally has only been subjected to \u201cminor\u201d affronts, incidents relating to other members have been more severe. A short while ago, Jeremy Cobyn called on the Speaker to get the leaders of all parties to issue a joint declaration \u201copposing any form of abusive language or threats\u201d. Rees-Mogg then congratulates Bercow for sitting in his chair for more than 10 hours. Amidst the turmoil in parliament tonight, the Brexit shadow secretary, Matthew Pennycook MP, has resigned, citing his desire to focus his efforts on campaigning \u201cunequivocally\u201d for remain in a second referendum and the imminent arrival of his second child. Anna Soubry is now speaking, again making the point that the use of inflammatory language in politics is vitally important to reflect on. She words such as \u201ctraitor\u201d, \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201ctreason\u201d are dangerous if deployed by politicians, and that the fact that MPs and their families are getting death threats because of such language could have grave consequences for parliamentary democracy. Boris Johnson has now left the chambers, which has caused some opposition MPs to complain to the Speaker. Bercow asked Johnson to stay and \u201csit down\u201d on his way out, and told him it would be \u201ccourteous\u201d, for him to stay, but then says he has been in the Commons for many hours and answered many, at times repetitive, questions, and that he does not think that the PM\u2019s departure represents a breech of the stipulations set out by the Supreme Court ruling. This from Brendan Cox, Jo Cox\u2019 widower, on the PM\u2019s remarks about his late wife tonight: Boris Johnson is now answering questions from a half empty chambers, more than 3 hours after he first appeared at the despatch box to address the Commons. Speaker John Bercow seems not bothered. \u201cThe hour is still quite early,\u201d he just told MPs. Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse made Johnson a rather extraordinary offer in the Commons. She said she will vote for his new deal, with the proviso that he promises to let the people make the ultimate decision in a second referendum. This, she said, would \u201cguarantee him\u201d a majority. Johnson\u2019s response is that this remark shows the Lib Dems can\u2019t be trusted, as party leader Jo Swinson pledged to revoke article 50 and scrap Brexit altogether. Here a video of Paula Sherriff\u2019s emotional speech about her friend Jo Cox, the Labour MP who was fatally shot and stabbed in June 2016 by a far-right extremist in the run up to the Brexit referendum. Cox was a passionate remain campaigner. Johnson\u2019s response of \u201cHumbug\u201d to Sherriff\u2019s speech is also being condemned. This from Channel 4\u2019s Ciaran Jenkins: And this from the Spectator\u2019s Isabel Hardman: Outrage about the PM\u2019s earlier suggestion that the best way to honour the murdered MP Jo Cox is to get Brexit done is widespread and growing. Here Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon: The Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson: And this from Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips: Just a little reminder that it\u2019s worth refreshing the blog every once in a while, as sometimes posts are added to or changed. And here a true nugget of gold, courtesy of Boris Johnson, here reported by the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul: Boris Johnson just said, when pressed on whether he\u2019ll go for a second prorogation, that the government will look closely at the provisions in the Supreme Court judgment to find a way forward. If you thought parliament gave Theresa May a tough time, tune in and watch the sheer rage Boris Johnson is at the receiving end of tonight. This from Labour MP Bridget Phillipson: This from Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner: This from Green MP Caroline Lucas: And this from my colleague Marina Hyde on tonight\u2019s backlash against the PM\u2019s tone: Johnson just said in the Commons that the best way of honouring the memory of Jo Cox and of bringing this country together is to get Brexit done. The atmosphere is still very charged, with a number of emotional speeches and pleas from MPs having taken place in the last half hour, with many addressing the distasteful tone in which much of the debate is being delivered. At some point, Johnson sounded like a father telling his distressed children that all will be well in the end, in a low, soft voice after many minutes of shouting and booing. This is the statement Lammy is referring to in the post below, here reported by the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley: This from Labour MP David Lammy, on Downing Street\u2019s announcement a little while ago that a second prorogation could be on the cards if the opposition does not table a no confidence vote tonight: And this from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on the scenes that have played out in the Commons over the last hour or so. This is a point well worth noting, in the words of SkyNews\u2019 Lewis Goodall: Labour MP Paula Sherriff just had a withering, tearful outburst in the Commons, saying Johnson should be \u201cashamed\u201d of his conduct and that MPs had been threatened and put in danger, and should enjoy more respect from the prime minister. Sherriff reminded MPs of her friend Jo Cox\u2019s fate, who was murdered by an extremist for standing publicly by her beliefs. The PM rebuffed her remarks with blunt indifference. This from the HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh: Justine Greening, who had the Conservative whip removed on 3 September and now sits as an independent politician, is now asking the PM whether, if he brings a deal back to the Commons and, if it is rejected, he will respect it. She asks also whether he will respect the Benn bill and ask for an extension. She adds that it is \u201cdeeply disrespectful\u201d of the PM to continue to call the Benn bill \u201csurrender bill\u201d. Johnson responds by saying the \u201csurrender act\u201d has done great damage to what the government is trying to do, a clear and direct provocation. Adds that there will not be another extension. The mood dips after this, with an almost eerie momentary silence falling over the Commons. Asked by Conservative MP Victoria Prentis whether he is working hard for a Brexit deal and whether MPs will have the opportunity to vote on another deal, Johnson responds: \u201cI can absolutely guarantee that if and when we are able to bring back an agreement that I think will work for this house and this country on October 17 and 18, of course we will put it to parliament and I do hope it will then get assent.\u201d Following the PM\u2019s statement, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts MP, has called on the prime minister to be impeached for misleading the public about his attempted shut down of parliament. Roberts reminded Johnson that he had supported current Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price\u2019s motion seeking to impeach Tony Blair in 2004 for lying about the Iraq war. The process of impeachment would involve the House of Commons first voting on an impeachment motion, which, if passed, could lead to prosecution and trial. Historically trials have taken place in Westminster Hall, on the parliamentary estate. Saville Roberts asked the PM: The prime minister is surely not a man who would like to look inconsistent. So, I ask him: does he still believe it to be right and proper to seek to impeach a prime minister who has been judged to mislead the public? Anna Soubry, the leader of the Independent Group for Change, calls on Johnson to apologise to parliament and to the Queen. The PM responds by bringing up John\u2019s Major\u2019s previous proroguing of parliament for 18 days, and adds that parliament still has enough time to debate Brexit and always had enough time. Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips says the biggest difference between her and the PM is that she\u2019d be ashamed if the Labour party was responsible for the current mess. She joins the chorus of MPs calling on Johnson to show remorse, apologise, and be honest. This from the Labour MP Toby Perkins: Yvette Cooper was next up, and brought up the incongruence between the attorney general\u2019s concession from earlier that the government \u201cgot it wrong\u201d in relation to prorogation of parliament, and the PM\u2019s statement in the Commons a little while ago, in which he told MPs that the supreme court judgment was wrong. Johnson responded by restating that the judgment \u201cwas wrong\u201d. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, weighed in shortly after, and reminded the PM that \u201cactions have consequences\u201d. \u201cEven my five-year-old knows that if you do something wrong you have to say sorry,\u201d she said. Added that if her son can apologise for kicking a football indoors, the prime minster can have the humility to say sorry for \u201cmisleading the Queen and illegally shutting down\u201d democracy. Jeremy Hunt told Boris Johnson that he\u2019s glad he\u2019s not PM. He said that a large proportion of people are being \u201calienated\u201d by attempts to block Brexit. Hello everyone, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Andrew Sparrow now. Ian Blackford, parliamentary leader of the SNP, is not beating around the bush tonight. \u201cHas he no shame?\u201d he asked about Boris Johnson in his speech in the Commons a little while ago. Blackford said Johnson accuses MPs of running off to the courts, but has no reasonable justification for his actions, and called it \u201cdevastating\u201d for a PM to have such judgment. That\u2019s not leadership, he said. He added that Johnson\u2019s language was \u201cdespicable\u201d and unsuitable for a PM, and that he is no longer tenable. He said the PM sought to silence parliament and fought the law, but the law won. \u201cThe opposition must unite to trigger a vote of no confidence to bring this chaotic government down,\u201d Blackford said. He reiterated that the SNP\u2019s priority is stopping no deal, and that doing nothing is no option anymore. The PM\u2019s \u201ctime must be up\u201d, he said. The Speaker, John Bercow, reminded Blackford that he must not call on the prime minister to \u201cend his lying\u201d. Blackford conceded. Earlier, when Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, was under pressure during questions, he retaliated with a blistering, offensive broadside about parliament, dismissing it as \u201cdead\u201d and having \u201cno moral right to sit\u201d. (See 12.21pm.) MPs have a perfect right to sit because they were elected, just two years ago, but no matter. A few hours later Boris Johnson chose exactly the same hyper-aggressive approach. Having been found to have acted unlawfully by the supreme court, some humility might have been expected. But instead Johnson sounded utterly unrepentant, and instead his speech amounted highly-charged, after-dinner rant about Labour and the rest of the opposition, whom he accused of blocking Brexit. Tory MPs loved it. And if the Number 10 strategy at the moment is all about depicting Johnson as a tribune of the Brexit-loving masses, taking on the courts and parliament, perhaps at one point, when the election comes, it will work. But what was striking was that this appears to be about the only strategy Johnson has. Today Johnson had absolutely nothing to say about his Brexit negotiating strategy and he had absolutely nothing to say about his strategy for getting legislation through parliament. Jeremy Corbyn said the speech amounted to \u201c10 minutes of bluster\u201d, and he was right. All the alpha-male belligerent bravado was cover for the fact that the PM seems to be running out of options. Here are the main points. Johnson challenged the opposition parties to call a vote of no confidence if they want a general election. He said he would make time for a motion tabled by a minor opposition party, not just Labour, to be debated. But the opposition parties want a guarantee that there will not be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October first, and so it is hard to see this offer being taken up. Johnson accused the opposition of being afraid of facing the public. This was undemocratic, he claimed. He said: It\u2019s not just that this parliament is in gridlock, paralysed and refusing to deliver the priorities of the people. It\u2019s not just unable to move forward. It\u2019s worse than that \u2013 out of sheer selfishness and political cowardice members opposite are unwilling to move aside and give the people a say. He said he wanted to offer voters a \u201clife after Brexit\u201d. He said: The public don\u2019t want another referendum \u2013 what they want and what they demand, is that we honour the promise we made to the voters to respect the first referendum. And they also want us to move on \u2013 to put Brexit behind us and focus on the NHS, on violent crime and on cutting the cost of living. That is why I also brought forward a Queen\u2019s speech. My government intends to present a programme for life after Brexit. He said that he thought the supreme court decision was wrong. Corbyn renewed his call for Johnson should resign. He opened his statement saying: I thank the prime minister for advance copy of his statement. Unfortunately it was like his illegal prorogation of parliament: null, of no effect, and should be quashed. This was 10 minutes of bluster from a dangerous prime minister who thinks he is above the law, but in truth is not fit for the office he holds. Corbyn said Labour would be happy to back an election as soon as Johnson agreed to extend article 50. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is taking over now. Johnson is replying to Corbyn. He says he does respect the supreme court. On the subject of the Benn Act, he says he will respect the law and come out of the EU on 31 October. He says preparations for a no-deal Brexit are going well. He says there is progress in the Brexit talks. But he says it has not been made any easier by the opposition, and the \u201csurrender bill\u201d (his term for the Benn Act). He says he is sorry the Labour conference is over. He says he would have liked people to have heard more of Labour policies like abolishing private schools. Johnson says he has heard that Corbyn wanted to announce an election in his conference speech. But he was censored by the \u201cStasi\u201d in Labour, in the form of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, he says. He says Corbyn is being held hostage by his party. \u201cFree the Islington One,\u201d he says. He says: \u201cThis parliament must either stand aside and either let this government get Brexit done or bring a vote of confidence and finally face a day of reckoning with the voters.\u201d As he ends he gets a prolonged round of applause from Conservative MPs. This is unusual. MPs are not supposed to applaud, and when MPs do break the rules, it is more often SNP and Labour MPs who clap than Tories. Corbyn says, for the good of the country, Johnson should go. He says he wants an election. And Johnson wants an election. Corbyn ends: If he wants an election, get an extension and let\u2019s have an election. Corbyn says Johnson also has questions to ask about his conduct in public office. He says the culture department is reviewing the awarding of a grant to a company run by his friend. Did Johnson initiate that review? Will he report himself to the Cabinet Office for investigation. Here is the Guardian\u2019s latest story on this, from my colleagues Rajeev Syal and Matthew Weaver. Corbyn says the Operation Yellowhammer document shows why a no-deal Brexit would be so serious. Why did the government describe these documents when they were leaked as out-of-date? When it was published, it was exactly the same? Corbyn says it talks of people going of without food and medicine. He says Johnson has hardly put any progress into the Brexit talks. Any progress has been minimal. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said there had been very little support. Corbyn says he has some questions for Johnson. Does Johnson think the government got it wrong, or does he agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg that the supreme court committed a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. Can Johnson confirm that he will abide by the terms of the Benn Act? Jeremy Corbyn is responding to Johnson now. He says Johnson\u2019s statement was similar to what the supreme court said about prorogation - \u201cnull, of no effect, and should be quashed\u201d. He says this is an extraordinary and precarious moment in this country\u2019s history. The highest court in the land found that the PM broke the law, he says. He says the judges concluded there was no reason, let alone a good reason, for the PM to have shut down parliament. He says Johnson should have done the right thing and resigned afterwards. But instead he is here, with no shred of humility and no substance either. Johnson says Labour has until the house rises today to table a motion of no confidence. If it does that, it can have the vote tomorrow. And he uses the line flagged up earlier about being willing to make the time for a confidence vote if the other opposition parties want to table a no confidence motion. Johnson ends by saying it is time to get Brexit done. He wants to deal with the people\u2019s priorities, like the NHS. He says parliament decided to hold this referendum. It should either get this done or face the voters. Johnson says the opposition parties had a remedy at their disposal. He says the opposition parties could have voted for an election. In Brighton Labour members demanded one - even though they twice voted against it. He says Jeremy Corbyn keeps changing his mind. He does not know whether John McDonnell has forced him to change his mind. He asks if Corbyn will vote no confidence in Johnson as PM. He asks if Corbyn even wants to be PM. He says Corbyn wants him to go to Brussels on 17 October to negotiate a delay. But Corbyn won\u2019t go himself. And even if he did want to go, his colleagues would not let him, because they don\u2019t want him negotiating for Britain with people like Vladimir Putin. Johnson says some MPs have been going to the courts to block Brexit. He says it is no disrespect to say that while he respects the supreme court, he thinks its decision was wrong. He says decisions about prorogation are political matters. He says the Labour party is determined to say it knows best, and to thumb its noses at the people. Jeremy Corbyn and his party do not trust the people, he says. He says they do not care about the extra cost of staying in. And they do not care about Brexit being delayed for months, he says. He says he wants to move up a gear. But Labour wants to put on the handbrake. He says he will not betray the people. Johnson says he wants to show the public there is \u201clife after Brexit\u201d. That is why he wants a Queen\u2019s speech, so he can show his domestic programme. Johnson says the opposition parties are promising a second referendum. But the idea that there could be a second referendum, with people respecting the result, is a fantasy, he says. He says the public do not want a second referendum. They want the first one honoured, he says. Boris Johnson is making his statement now. He says the British people just want Brexit done. He says he has been making progress in the Brexit talks with the EU. In his speech to the Labour conference yesterday Jeremy Corbyn accused Boris Johnson of planning to send troops to Saudia Arabia. He told delegates: It really beggars belief that this week Boris Johnson is openly talking about sending troops to Saudi Arabia as part of the increasingly dangerous confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, in an apparent bid to appease Donald Trump. Have we learned nothing? In the Commons a few minutes ago, in a statement on Iran, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, repeated the same point, saying that Johnson was \u201copenly talking about sending troops to Saudia Arabia in an apparent bid to please Donald Trump\u201d. She asked for an assurance that, if troops were going to be sent to the Gulf for military action, that the Commons would get a vote. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, claimed that there were no such plans. Responding to Thornberry, he said: [Thornberry] talked whether the UK would be sending troops to Saudia Arabia. There has been no suggestion of that at all. It is simply wrong for her to say it. What has been said is that the US is sending troops to Saudi Arabia to make sure that Saudi can protect itself from further attacks, or repeats of the attacks Aramco. We have said that we would consider a request that we\u2019ve received for support in relation to air defences. That is something that we will consider. But we are absolutely clear that our over-arching strategic objective is deescalation, reducing tensions. And we want to see Iran come in from out of the international cold. But we need to be absolutely unwavering and clear in our resolve that the only way that will happen is if Iran steps up and starts to meet its responsibilities. The suggestion that the UK was considering sending troops to Saudia Arabia, emerged from what Boris Johnson said when he spoke to reporters on his flight to New York recently, although the headlines about troops being despatched (see here and here) did not necessarily match what was actually being proposed. According to a leak of what Boris Johnson is due to say in his statement to MPs shortly, he will challenge the opposition parties to table a motion of no confidence in the government. This is from the Press &amp; Journal\u2019s Dan O\u2019Donoghue. Under current parliamentary rules only a motion of no confidence tabled by the leader of the opposition has to be debated. Jeremy Corbyn says he will only do that when he is sure he can win, and when he has absolutely guaranteed that there will not be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Johnson seems to be planning to say that, if the Lib Dems or the SNP tabled a no confidence motion, he would make time for it to be debated. But all the opposition parties are agreed at the moment that they want an absolute guarantee that there will not be a no-deal Brexit first. My colleague Heather Stewart has more on the plans for a vote tomorrow on a mini-recess to allow Tory MPs to attend their party conference in Manchester. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley John Bercow, the Speaker, has just confirmed that he wants Boris Johnson\u2019s statement to MPs to start at 6.30pm. This is from Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti. He says Labour MPs have been told to expect a vote on a conference recess tomorrow. The Tories want to go ahead with a recess so that they can hold their party conference in Manchester. Jeremy Corbyn said this morning that Labour was not in favour of agreeing a recess motion, although Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, suggested the party might offer some flexibility. See 9.46am. According to the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard, Labour suggested that one compromise might be for the Commons to sit next week, but with no contentious legislation scheduled for early in the week. The government does not seem to have accepted the offer. My colleague Gwyn Topham has a wonderful story on the Grant Shapps Thomas Cook statement earlier. This is how it starts. If there was a previous transport secretary that the incumbent, Grant Shapps, might hope not to imitate, it would surely be his notoriously calamity-stricken predecessor Chris Grayling. But just a few months after his return to cabinet after several years out in the cold, Shapps appears to have followed Grayling\u2019s example rather too closely \u2013 lifting sections of his speech to the House of Commons on the collapse of Thomas Cook from Grayling\u2019s equivalent statement when Monarch Airlines went bust in 2017. At the beginning of his statement, Shapps appears to have followed Grayling\u2019s text almost to the letter, simply substituting Thomas Cook for Monarch and adjusting numbers. \u201cWith your permission, I would like to make a statement about the steps the government have been taking to support those affected by the collapse of Monarch Airlines, Thomas Cook, in particular the 110,000 150,000 passengers left abroad without a flight back to the UK and the almost 2,000 9,000 people who have lost their jobs.\u201d And here is the full story. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar In the Commons Labour\u2019s Justin Madders asks Gove if he has any plans to use the Civil Contingencies Act in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Gove says he has no plans to use it. His statement is now over. John Bercow, the Speaker, says 87 backbenchers were able to ask questions. The Gove statement is still going on \u2013 although the length of the statement is in inverse proportion to the quantity of information being revealed. Gove is doing a very professional job of sidestepping the awkward questions. We have got a statement on Iran from the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to come next. All this means that it will probably be 6.30pm at the earliest before Boris Johnson starts his statement. In response to a question from the independent MP John Woodcock, Gove says it is impossible to tell if the food bill for an average low-income family will go up or down after Brexit. Antoinette Sandbach, the former Tory now sitting as an independent, asks Gove if the government will now publish all version of the Operation Yellowhammer documents, as it is supposed to under the terms of the \u201chumble address\u201d motion. Gove does not give that commitment. He just says the government is publishing a lot of detail about its no-deal planning. Responding to a private notice question in the Lords on the extension of article 50, Lord Callanan, minister of state for exiting the European Union, repeated again and again that the government would always \u201cabide by the law\u201d, but refused to be drawn on whether they would seek to find a loophole in the Benn Act. He was asked repeatedly about quotes from a Number 10 spokesperson that the government could send a second letter \u2013 along with the letter requesting an extension as mandated in the Benn Act \u2013 which sought to dissuade the EU from granting a delay. \u201cThe government will of course abide by the law,\u201d he said, in response to a question by Labour\u2019s Lady Hayter of Kentish Town. Lord Cormack, a Conservative, followed up: \u201cCan I ask my noble friend to confirm that in the unhappy event, and for me it would be an unhappy event, that no deal is reached by 31 October, that the prime minister will abide by the law that parliament has passed?\u201d \u201cI am happy to confirm to the noble Lord the answer that I gave earlier: the government will abide by the law,\u201d said Callanan. Labour\u2019s Lord Harris of Haringey said Callanan hadn\u2019t answered the question. He went on: We of course assume that the government will abide by the law. But the question was about [whether] a second letter would be sent saying to the EU \u2018please don\u2019t accept our request\u2019. Can he give a categorical assurance that the government will not do that and will not seek to go around the wording of the law which was passed by this house. Callanan replied: I can give the noble lord a categorical assurance that the government will abide by the law. We write all sorts of letters to all sorts of people, all of the time. I\u2019m sure letter-writing will continue even in no deal. And I can go no further that to repeat what I\u2019ve said which is of course we are a law-abiding government. Earlier Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told the Commons that the automative industry was ready for a no-deal Brexit. As the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam points out that, that is not what the industry\u2019s trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said this week. Labour\u2019s Owen Smith asks Gove if he can assure police officers in Northern Ireland will not be asked to patrol the Irish border, putting their lives at risk. Gove says the government has \u201cabsolutely no intention\u201d of putting infrastructure at or near the border that might have to be policed. Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney general, asks when the phrase \u201cbase case\u201d in the Operation Yellowhammer document was changed to \u201cworst case\u201d. And he says, as chair of the intelligence and security committee, he wants to know what the mitigations are that will replace having access to the Schengen database. Gove explains the difference between base case (agreed outcomes) and worst case, but he does not say when the wording was changed. And he refuses to say what the alternatives to the Schengen database will be. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, says even if Border Force officers get new powers, they will not have the information they need to check people in the event of a no-deal Brexit. She asks Gove why he is claiming the UK would be safer. Gove says she has questioned people involved in national security and the Border Force. \u201cAppropriate mitigations are in place,\u201d he says, and new powers are available. Sir David Lidington, the former Cabinet Office minister, asks what will happen in Northern Ireland if there is a no-deal Brexit. How will the civil service be able to manage if there is no functioning executive. Gove says if there is still no power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland, the government would have to consider giving new powers to Northern Ireland civil service. That is because, under no deal, the civil servants running Northern Ireland would need to take decisions (in relation to matters like customs) going beyond the powers they currently have. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, asks how Britain will be safer than before when the police will not have access to EU crime and justice databases in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Because Border Force staff will have new powers, says Gove. Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, asks if hauliers have done what is necessary to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Green represents Ashford in Kent. Gove says the government is contacting hauliers. But further steps need to be taken. Gove is responding to Starmer. He starts by welcoming Starmer back from Brighton, saying one thing about the House of Commons is that at least they record votes properly. That\u2019s a reference to Labour deciding its new Brexit policy on a show of hands, despite calls for a card vote. Gove repeats his point about the withdrawal agreement now being \u201cin play\u201d in the negotiations. And he says business is preparing for Brexit. But Gove spends most of his time criticising Labour, and he ends by saying Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit policy is \u201cas solid as a blancmange in a hurricane\u201d. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is responding to Gove now. He asks Gove to confirm that the four papers submitted to the EU about alternatives to the backstop are \u201cnon-papers\u201d. And is it right they have not been shared with the EU27? Starmer says he does not accept that businesses are well prepared. He sat with business leaders last week, and their main concern was about how ill-prepared businesses were. He asks about the Commons vote earlier this month requiring the publication of all the Operation Yellowhammer documents. He says the government just published a short document (pdf). Nothing else has been disclosed. Gove claimed it was a document from the last government. But it was dated 2 August, when Boris Johnson was PM, Starmer says Gove claimed on the Marr Show was that this was an old document, and the worst-case scenario. Gove also claimed it was being updated, Starmer says. He asks Gove to explain why, when it was leaked to the Sunday Times, it said it was a base case scenario. But when it was published it was described as worst-case scenario. Referring to Gove\u2019s comment on LBC this morning about Boris Johnson being a \u201cborn winner\u201d (see 11am), Starmer says he is glad that Gove has not lost his sense of humour. He says to leave the country unprepared for a no-deal Brexit is unforgivable. In the Commons Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, is making a statement now. He says there has been \u201csignificant movement in recent weeks\u201d in the the Brexit talks with the EU. Until recently the withdrawal agreement was sacrosanct. But now they have acknowledged that it can be changed. And up until this point, the European Union have also said that the backstop was inviolable but again European leaders have said they are \u2018not emotionally attached to the backstop\u2019 and there are other ways, other ways, of ensuring that we can safeguard the gains of the Good Friday/Belfast agreement and also ensure that smooth trade flows across the island of Ireland. He says he wants to talk about no-deal plans. The cabinet XO (EU exit operations) has met 48 times, he says. He says under Operation Yellowhammer the government has prepared for worst-case scenarios. From my colleague Daniel Boffey From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth One theory is that the PM could resign, oblige the Queen to make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister, defeat the government on a no confidence motion and then wait for the election a few weeks later. But there are two obvious problems with this tactic. 1) As PM Corbyn would have the authority to request an extension to article 50. That means Boris Johnson would be leading the opposition Tory party into a general election having failed to deliver his key pledge \u2013 taking the UK out of the EU by 31 October. 2) Incumbent prime minister have considerable advantages in electoral politics. Even with a government majority, they can exercise power and patronage and spend government money. And for Johnson the danger would be that, after having Corbyn as PM for a few months, the public might decide they like him a lot more. David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary who had the whip withdrawn earlier this month after rebelling over Brexit, has called for Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief of staff, to be sacked. Cummings is blamed for Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to adopt a highly confrontational approach to parliament, including proroguing parliament for five weeks. \u201cI think the prime minister needs a different strategy and a different strategist,\u201d Gauke told the World at One. A plan is in place to restrict holiday leave for police officers in Northern Ireland following Brexit. As the Press Association reports, a total of 10% of officers will be able to take time off for the first six weeks after the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union on 31 October. Police Service of Northern Ireland assistant chief constable George Clarke described it in an interview with the PA news agency as a \u201csensible operational contingency\u201d, adding it would be kept under review. MPs returning to parliament on Wednesday are discussing plans to force Boris Johnson to request a Brexit extension earlier than the current 19 October deadline, to avoid no deal, my colleague Kate Proctor reports. In the Commons Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is making a statement about Thomas Cook. He said that bailing out the company would have involved \u201cthrowing good money after bad\u201d, but he said the government would legislate to ensure that in future airlines can be wound down in a more orderly way. He told MPs: [Firms] need to be able to look after their customers and we need to be able to ensure their planes can keep flying in order that we don\u2019t have to set up a shadow airline. This is where we will focus our efforts in the next couple of weeks. We will require primary legislation, and, dare I say it, a new session of parliament. While all eyes are on the newly reconvened Commons, the Labour party\u2019s autumn conference is still under way. Members this morning voted overwhelmingly to give full voting rights to all UK residents, urging the party to extend the franchise to millions of migrants. As well as extending voting rights, the motion tabled by the Labour for Free Movement campaign calls on a future Labour government to close all immigration detention centres, ending \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d policies, and to seeking to extend free movement rights. The motion also opposed immigration systems based on a person\u2019s income or \u201cutility to big business\u201d and any caps or targets on the numbers of people moving to the UK. The fact that a motion passes at the Labour party\u2019s conference does not necessarily mean it will end up in a future general election manifesto, though it contributes to the policy-making process. Only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens are able to vote in general elections, while citizens of EU countries can vote in local elections and European elections. Extending the vote to the 3 million EU nationals living in the UK would have a significant impact on any second referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership. Ana Oppenheim, from the Labour Campaign for Free Movement and the leftwing pro-EU group Another Europe is Possible, said it was \u201ca source of shame for many activists\u201d that the party\u2019s 2017 manifesto pledged to end free movement. She said: Now we can move forward not only committed to defending free movement, but to giving migrants the vote. If we win, the next election will be the last election in which people like me are shut out of the democratic process. Celebrating the success of the motion the Labour Campaign for Free Movement tweeted a photograph of the controversial \u201cControls on Immigration\u201d mug, which was produced by the Labour party during the 2015 general election campaign. \u201cNow officially in the bin,\u201d the tweet read. The motion said Labour should campaign for \u201cfree movement, equality and rights for migrants\u201d. It also said: Free movement, equality and rights for migrants, are socialist values and benefit us all. Confronted with attacks on migrants \u2013 from the racist \u2018hostile environment\u2019 to the Conservatives\u2019 immigration bill that plans to end free movement and strip the rights of working-class migrants \u2013 we stand for solidarity, equality and freedom. Scapegoating, ending free movement and attacking migrants\u2019 rights are attacks on all workers. They make migrant workers more precarious and vulnerable to hyperexploitation, pressing down wages and conditions for everyone. They divide us, making it harder to unionise and push back. At the 2017 election Labour\u2019s manifesto said freedom of movement within the EU would end when the UK ceased to be a member. After Brexit Labour wants a close relationship with the single market, but it has not formally committed to keeping the UK in the single market \u2013 a move that would ensure EU free movement continued. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, told MPs earlier that the government would comply with the Benn Act that is intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. (See 12.34pm.) But ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston has had a message from a government source implying that, although the PM would be willing to write a letter to the EU formally requesting an article 50 extension (in the event of there being no Brexit deal by 19 October), he would also send a second letter containing all sorts of arguments intended to ensure that the EU would say no. Peston himself is not one of those people inclined to use capital letters in his tweets, and so I\u2019m presuming that the angry, Trump-style capitalisation comes from an original message sent by his source. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, is speaking now. He says it is hard to see how the grant to Hacker House was justified. It was awarded under a scheme intended to develop cyber-skills in the UK. But this company is headquartered in California, and its owner lives in the US, he says. And it refuses to say how many employees it has in the UK, or where they work. Then he turns to Boris Johnson. Watson goes on: The truth is our prime minister does reckless things. He is a man whose character rends him unfit for the office he holds. Warman repeats his point about Johnson not being involved in the decision to award the grant to Hacker House. He criticises Watson for raising issues irrelevant to this issue. In the Commons Matt Warman, the culture minister, is answering an urgent question about the \u00a3100,000 grant to Hacker House - a company run by Jennifer Arcuri, a close friend of Boris Johnson\u2019s. He confirms that Hacker House has had a grant. He says the culture department is reviewing whether this grant was properly awarded. The Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, who tabled the UQ, says she is not interested in Johnson\u2019s personal life. But she is interested in ensuring that the rules are followed. She says these grants are supposed to go to UK companies, but that this firm does not seem to be genuinely based in the UK. And she asks if Johnson was involved in the award of the grant. Warman says Johnson and his staff were not involved in the decision to award this grant. He says Hacker House is registered with Companies House as being based in the UK. He says he is happy to answer questions about whether this grant was properly awarded. But he says Moran should not be using this issue to \u201cspread tittle-tattle\u201d. Cox has just finished. At this rate, Boris Johnson is unlikely to be starting his statement before 5pm. Cox has just said that the government will bring forward another motion calling for a general election \u201cshortly\u201d. It tried twice earlier in the month, but on both occasions failed to get get the support of two-thirds of MPs, as required under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for an early election to happen. Phillip Lee, the former Tory MP who defected to the Lib Dems, told Cox he should be showing more humility. He asks him if he can say if he has given Downing Street legal advice on bypassing the Benn Act. Cox said that he was not allowed to say whether he had given legal advice on a topic or not. But he said Lee was not in a position to urge him to show more humility. Having been elected for one party, and now sitting for another without holding a byelection, Lee should be \u201con his knees\u201d begging for forgiveness from his constituents, Cox said. Amber Rudd, the former Tory work and pensions secretary who now sits as an independent having resigned over Brexit, tells Cox she objects to him calling this a \u201cdead\u201d parliament. She says it was only elected in 2017. She says, if it is divided, that is because it reflects the divisions in Britain. I must raise my concerns about the attorney general constantly saying that this parliament is dead. This parliament was elected in 2017, it reflects the divisions in this country, the divisions in our communities and the divisions in our families. The failure is that we have not yet reached a compromise, many of us long to leave the EU as we set out in the referendum but are frustrated by the fact that we have not been able to find a consensus amongst the different factions. Cox replies: If I had not been driven to this language, I would not have used it. But he was driven to use this language, he says. No one worked harder than he did to get a compromise deal through parliament, he says. He goes on: I have now reached a sad conclusion that this parliament is no longer worth sitting. It should be gone, for any good it is doing. Here is a full version of what Geoffrey Cox said about parliament being a \u201cdisgrace\u201d with \u201cno moral right to sit\u201d. He was responding to a question from Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary who lost the Tory whip after rebelling over Brexit. Cox said: I would agree with him that parliament has to determine the terms on which we leave, but this parliament has declined three times to pass a withdrawal act, with which the opposition \u2013 in relation to the withdrawal act \u2013 had absolutely no objection. Then we now have a wide number of this house setting its face against leaving at all. And when this government draws the only logical inference from that position, which is that it must leave therefore without any deal at all, it still sets its face, denying the electorate the chance of having its say in how this matter should be resolved. This parliament is a dead parliament. It should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on these green benches ... They don\u2019t like to hear it Mr Speaker. Twice they have been asked to let the electorate decide upon whether they should be allowed to sit in their seats, while they block 17.4 million people\u2019s vote. This parliament is a disgrace. Given the opportunity, since I am asked, let me tell them the truth: they could vote no confidence at any time, but they are too cowardly. They could agree to a motion to allow this house to dissolve but they are too cowardly. This parliament should have the courage to face the electorate. But it won\u2019t, because so many of them are really all about preventing us leaving the European Union at all. But the time is coming, the time is coming Mr Speaker, when even these turkeys won\u2019t be able to prevent Christmas. Cox has just told MPs that in future it might make sense for appointments to the supreme court to be approved by parliament. In response to a question about whether allowing MPs to confirm judicial appointments would be necessary if the courts became more political, he said MPs might have to \u201creflect\u201d on that. He said Brexit would mean \u201cwe are going to have to look again at our constitutional arrangements\u201d. As the UK left the EU, a \u201cgreat gap\u201d would open up in the law, he said. One matter may very well be whether there needs to be parliamentary scrutiny of judicial appointments in some manner. But Cox said that he personally would not be \u201centhusiastic\u201d about the idea. Jacob Rees Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, is expected to lay out government business this afternoon. He is expected to request a short break for Conservative Party conference - a proposal which Jeremy Corbyn said they could oppose. The Conservative party has indicated it will continue with conference, scheduled to take place in Manchester from Sunday to Wednesday next week, whatever is decided by Parliament. James Cleverly, the party\u2019s co-chairman, has Tweeted that it will go ahead. A debate could be held on any proposed break as early as Thursday. If the government loses that vote, it could give the Conservatives a real headache. Conference is a highly lucrative event for the party. If a break is not formally supported, it could force Tory ministers and MPs to return from conference events for votes. One option for the government would be to table non-controversial bills for next week, which would take up most of the day. However, they might still have to return for major votes. It has also emerged that the government\u2019s opponents in parliament could apply to the high court asking for a civil servant to go to Brussels if Boris Johnson has not brought back a deal by October 19th and refuses to request an article 50 extension. It is understood that an application would be made at the Royal Courts of Justice to direct a high ranking civil servant, possibly the cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, to carry out parliament\u2019s duty. The Queen\u2019s speech, scheduled for October 14, is where the government will set out its agenda and forthcoming priorities. A vote is scheduled to take place five days later on October 21, where MPs will debate the measures put forward by the government. Nick Boles, the former Conservative who now sits as an independent, asked Cox if he could give MPs an assurance that the government would abide by the Benn Act in the event of the government not agreeing a Brexit deal. In those circumstances, the act says, the PM must request a three-month Brexit extension. Cox gave a clear answer: \u201cYes.\u201d Twice now Geoffrey Cox has challenged the opposition to agree to back an early general election by backing a one-line bill amending the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and allowing one. This mechanism could have been used in early September to hold a general election before 31 October. Although Labour said it wanted an early election, it argued that it could not risk this approach because it could not be sure that the PM would not change the date of the election, to hold it after 31 October. Cox seemed to be implying that the government would back a one-line bill that would specify a particular date for the election. But it is now too late. Under electoral law an election has to take place at least 25 working days after dissolution, and so even if parliament were to pass a law and dissolve today, it would be impossible to hold an election before 31 October. Attack is the best form of defence, they often say. And Geoffrey Cox, who has faced considerable criticism during this UQ, has just retaliated with remarkable attack on the opposition, and the authority of parliament. He said that parliament was \u201cdead\u201d and had \u201cno moral right to sit\u201d, but that the opposition were afraid of an election. This parliament is a dead parliament. It should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on these green benches. This generated an uproar from the opposition. But Cox went on, saying the opposition did not like to hear what he had to say. Twice MPs have been asked to approve a general election, he said. But they would not allow one, he went on. This parliament is a disgrace ... They could vote no confidence at any time. But they are too cowardly ... This parliament should have the courage to face the electorate. But it won\u2019t because so many of them are about preventing us leaving the European Union. But the time is coming when even these turkeys won\u2019t be able to prevent Christmas. Here is LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood on Cox\u2019s answer to Letwin. (See 12.09am.) Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Tory Cabinet Office minister who lost the whip after rebelling over Brexit earlier this month, asks Cox for an assurance that there will be no further prorogation, other than a short one ahead of a possible Queen\u2019s speech, before the end of October. Cox says he can assure Letwin that the government will comply with the supreme court judgment. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle asks Cox how Jacob Rees-Mogg can stay as leader of the Commons if he has accused the supreme court of a constitutional coup. Cox says there is \u201cnothing wrong with expressing robust, critical views about a judgment\u201d. There is nothing wrong with expressing robust critical views about a judgment, in so far as it imputes inappropriate or improper motive then it is wrong. So, I think it\u2019s a question of wording and of being careful with ones language but I took that remark in so far as I saw it reported simply to be a robust criticism of the judgment and nothing more. Cox says it is acceptable to be critical of judgments. But it is not acceptable to attack the motives of judges, he says. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, asked Cox if he agreed that the supreme court ruling was a constitutional coup. (See 10.26am.) Cox implied that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, did not really mean it when he used that phrase. Cox said: I don\u2019t think it was a constitutional coup ... I don\u2019t think anybody does ... These things can be said in the heat of rhetorical and poetic licence. In response to a question from Dominic Grieve, a former Tory who now sits as an independent, Cox says he would not have been able to support a decision to prorogue parliament until the end of October. If the PM had proposed that, Cox would have resigned, he suggests. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow solicitor general, says the supreme court judgment amounts to \u201cthe most damning judicial indictment of a government in modern times\u201d. He says the government \u201cstands shamed \u2013 tendering illegal advice to Her Majesty\u201d. He says the legal advice should be published in full. And he points out that, although Cox is saying he accepts the supreme court judgment, Michael Gove told the BBC this morning that the government still thought it had done nothing wrong. (See 8.09am.) He says the government has already been found in contempt of parliament. Now it has been found in contempt of law. Cox says there is nothing unusual about a lawyer having his opinion rejected by a court. He says courts in Scotland and in England backed his view. If people think Cox should resign, should the lord chief justice and the master of the rolls (who both said prorogation was lawful) resign too? He accuses Thomas-Symonds of a \u201cshameless piece of cynical opportunism\u201d. He says his advice was sound at the time. The supreme court took a different view, he says. He says it was entitled to do that. But it was making new law. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry told Cox she was not calling for his resignation \u2013 yet. But she asked him if he could confirm what Amber Rudd said \u2013 that cabinet ministers asked to see the prorogation legal advice, but that they were not shown it. In reply, Cox repeated the point he had made about considering what more might be published, but he did not address the point about ministers being denied access to it. Cox says the government does not publish the legal advice it gets. But he says he would consider over the coming days whether the public interest would be served by his disclosing more information about the advice given to the government in this case. Cox says he will consider publishing more information about the legal advice he gave the PM about prorogation. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is responding to an urgent question from the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry about his legal advice regarding prorogation. Yesterday Sky News ran a story about Cox advising the government that a five-week prorogation would be lawful. It led to Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, saying that Cox should consider his position. Cox says the government set out its view in a court document published on the supreme court\u2019s website. He says the government thought prorogation was legal. On the subject of resigning, he says: If every time I lost a case I was called upon to resign, I would probably have never had a practice. He says the government accepts the judgment from the supreme court. At all times the government acted in good faith and in the belief that its approach was both lawful and constitutional. John Bercow, the Speaker, is addressing MPs. He says the official record will be changed so that the reference to parliament being prorogued will be \u201cexpunged\u201d. Instead he says it will be recorded that parliament adjourned until today instead. He thanks the staff of the Commons for allowing it to meet today. He says there are no ministerial questions today, including no PMQs. That is because three days are normally allowed for MPs to table questions. The UK must table written proposals to solve the Irish border Brexit question within the next week, Leo Varadkar and Donald Tusk have said. The taoiseach revealed the details of his conversation with Tusk on Monday in New York in remarks after his meeting with Boris Johnson last night. He said: We have working methods and I know that President Tusk and other EU heads of government would like to see British proposals in writing really in the first week of October, otherwise it is very hard to see how we could agree something at the summit in the middle of October. He also signalled a significant shift on the EU\u2019s opposition to re-opening the withdrawal agreement by noting it could not be changed at the last minute because of its treaty status. The withdrawal agreement is actually an international treaty. It\u2019s not the kind of thing that can be amended or cobbled together late at night at the European council meeting on 17 October. So if the UK does have meaningful proposals, changes that they would like to suggest to the withdrawal agreement or to the joint political declaration more particularly, we really need to see them in advance so that they can be worked through and worked up in advance of the EU summit. A full write up is in the Irish Times. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is speaking to the media outside Westminster now. She says the Lib Dems want parliament to bring forward a mechanism that would stop the government trying to bypass the Benn Act, which is designed to stop the UK leaving the EU on 31 October without a deal. Although the government says it will obey the law, Johnson also says repeatedly \u2013 as he did again yesterday \u2013 that the UK will definitely leave the EU on 31 October, implying that in the event of no deal he wants to ignore the act. Labour has also said it wants to get further assurances to ensure that the Benn Act achieves what it is supposed to achieve. Both Labour and the Lib Dems are saying that, once they get those absolute guarantees, they will back a general election. But they have not said yet what parliament could do to make the act watertight. We are also getting two urgent questions today. UQs come first, so Joanna Cherry will be up at 11.30am. Hacker House is the company which has Boris Johnson\u2019s close friend, or former close friend, Jennifer Arcuri as a director. It received a \u00a3100,000 grant from the culture department. In normal circumstances this story would probably be dominating the news, but it is probably not Johnson\u2019s primary worry at the moment. This is from Robert Buckland, the justice secretary and lord chancellor. It may be a veiled dig at his cabinet colleague, Jacob Rees-Mogg. (See 10.26am.) Boris Johnson is a winner like the Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, Michael Gove has said. The Cabinet Office minister told LBC: I think it is only fair to say that Boris is the Pep Guardiola of British politics. Asked about the court \u201chumiliation\u201d, Gove also said: Words like humiliation are good journalistic hyperbole. In response to a question on whether the prime minister\u2019s losing streak would be longer than Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s, Gove said: No, look, the prime minister is a born winner ... he was mayor of London twice, he beat Ken Livingstone twice. Those statements have now been confirmed. Because parliament is reconvening at short notice, there are no questions today, and no bills or debates scheduled. In fact, the agenda is empty. Statements often take about an hour. If Grant Shapps starts at 11.30am, with the Thomas Cook statement, you would expect Johnson to start at around 2.30pm. But urgent questions come before statements, and apparently the Speaker has received 32 applications for urgent questions. (See 10.41am.) Perhaps he might take two or three? If so, you would expect Johnson to speak late afternoon. Boris Johnson is expected to address parliament later now that he is back in the country, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby reports. Boris Johnson is back in the UK after his trip to the UN in New York. His RAF Voyager touched down a few minutes ago, PA Media reports. Lord Heseltine, the former Conservative deputy prime minister, has criticised Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, for describing the supreme court judgment as a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. (See 10.08am.) He said Rees-Mogg used to be a \u201cpillar of rectitude\u201d. But in the last few weeks he has been seen lounging on the front bench, and criticising the supreme court, Heseltine said. He went on: This is a Tory, this is someone who believes in the high principles of Conservatism, taking about a constitutional coup when he\u2019s lost a legal case. If I\u2019m arraigned on some sort of criminal charge in the courts, and I then said \u2018Well, of course it\u2019s a personal vendetta\u2019, people would laugh. Yet we\u2019ve got the leader of the House of Commons talking about the unanimous judgment of 11 judges, calling it a constitutional coup. Heseltine is an arch-remainer, and so you would expect him to be critical of Rees-Mogg. But Sir Geoffrey Clifton Brown, a Tory Brexiter, told the same programme that he also thought Rees-Mogg\u2019s language was wrong. Clifton-Brown said: I do think it\u2019s a lapse of judgment on Jacob\u2019s behalf. And, like Lord Heseltine, I\u2019m surprised that he said that. As a result of 24 hours since the judgment, I think cooler minds will prevail. Michael Gove was very careful what he said this morning about criticising the supreme court. We are the party of law and order. We will accept and uphold the judgment. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, reportedly described the supreme court judgment as a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d when cabinet ministers spoke on a conference call last night. This morning, in an interview on Sky News, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister refused to deny the story. Sky\u2019s Sarah-Jane Mee asked him three times if the reports about what Rees-Mogg were wrong, and each time Gove sidestepped the question. When she asked a fourth time, he replied: I don\u2019t recognise that language at all. This sounds like a denial, but actually it isn\u2019t. It is a formula frequently used by politicians at the moment when they want to sound as if they are denying a story but don\u2019t feel comfortable saying it is untrue. The justification for using the phrase is that the reality of what happened was rather different from the way it was reported. But that is true of almost any event reported second-hand as seen by someone who was involved in person. In his Today interview Jeremy Corbyn seemed to rule out Labour voting for a short Commons recess next week to allow the Conservative party conference in Manchester to go ahead. (See 8.41am.) But Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics that the shadow cabinet would be discussing this issue when it meets this morning. She suggested that the Labour party might agree to the Commons not sitting early next week. Asked whether Labour would let a mini conference recess go ahead, she replied: The Labour party is very benevolent and believes in fair play. So we\u2019ll see what [the Conservatives] come forward with. But we want to be benevolent. Normally, when the Conservative conference is on, the Commons is in recess for the whole week. The opposition parties will almost certainly want it to be sitting next Wednesday for PMQs, when Boris Johnson was meant to be delivering his party conference speech, but one option might be to agree for the Commons not to sit for a day or two at the start of the week, so a shortened conference could go ahead. We are likely to know more about what is happening by the end of the day. On the subject of who might head an interim government, if Boris Johnson were to lose a confidence vote and if the opposition parties were to unite behind someone else who could take over solely to negotiate a Brexit delay with the EU and then hold a general election, Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt says Margaret Beckett is a possible candidate. Beckett, a former foreign secretary and former leader of the Commons, is respected by MPs from all sides of the Commons. Unlike Hilary Benn, another Labour backbencher sometimes tipped as leader of an interim, cross-party anti-no-deal government, she would be more amenable to Jeremy Corbyn and his team. She would also be seen as someone with no ambition to hold on to the job beyond a general election. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Simon Murphy. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, was on the Today programme earlier this morning and he said something potentially important about what might happen after a vote of no confidence in the Commons. One plan would be for the opposition parties to install an interim PM who could request a delay to Brexit and then hold a general election. In the past the SNP has been very negative about the idea of installing Jeremy Corbyn as PM. But this morning Blackford indicated that the SNP might support putting Corbyn into Downing Street on this interim PM basis. Asked whether he could support Corbyn taking over in those circumstances, Blackford said: I\u2019m less concerned about the individual. I think it is fair to say that, in such a scenario, the official leader of the opposition is the first point of contact as far as that is concerned. But we are only talking about putting someone in place in order to call an election. On that basis, I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to that [Corbyn being interim PM]. Reaction here from some lobby journalists on Corbyn\u2019s interview. And this, from the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley, on a dig Corbyn made about what he considers to be unfair media coverage. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has already called on Boris Johnson to resign, says the prime minister should apologise to the Queen and the British people following the supreme court ruling. In a rare appearance on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said Johnson abused his powers. I think he should apologise both to her [the Queen] for the advice he gave her [over suspending parliament] but, more importantly, apologise to the British people for what he\u2019s done in trying to shut down our democracy at a very crucial time when people are very, very worried about what will happen on 31 October. Johnson did speak to the Queen yesterday after the supreme court ruling, although No 10 has refused to say whether he apologised. In his interview Corbyn said his priority was to prevent a no-deal exit but he would not be bounced into a general election before that is secured. Asked about accusations he is scared of holding a general election because of his party\u2019s dire poll ratings, he replied: I\u2019m very happy to have a general election when we\u2019ve taken no deal off the table and the EU has granted that extension. Pressed on his party\u2019s poor polling, he claimed Labour had been a \u201cvery effective opposition\u201d. Corbyn also confirmed Labour will not vote for a short recess for Conservative party conference next week. Reaction here from the editor of Politics Home, Kevin Schofield, to that Gove interview. Michael Gove denied the government did anything wrong by suspending parliament \u2013 despite the supreme court\u2019s ruling yesterday. The Tory cabinet minister, who is in charge of no-deal planning, said he respected the court\u2019s position but would not accept being at fault over prorogation. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether the government did something wrong by proroguing parliament, Gove said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d Accused of having a lack of humility during a testy interview, he replied: I absolutely respect the integrity of the supreme court, I respect the judgment, the government will comply with it. That is the law. It is also the case that the principle of judicial review is a well-understood one, it has often been the case that government ministers have taken actions which they believed were right and then the courts, whether it\u2019s been the high court or other courts, have said: \u2018Actually, do you know what? Your exercise of your executive power or your prerogative power was wrong\u2019. Tory grandee Ken Clarke \u2013 who has been tipped as a potential caretaker prime minister \u2013 stops short of calling for Boris Johnson to resign but says the supreme court ruling \u201cleaves us back in a more sensible constitutional position\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think it just leaves us back in a more sensible constitutional position. The smash, bang, wallop approach to government of the country in the last few weeks was in danger of leaving us in an extraordinary situation. It was as if we were going to have President Trump but with no checks and balances, just a presidential system. Asked about the next steps in parliament, he said: The most important task is to decide as quickly as we can how we are going to move forward on Brexit. It\u2019s not true, which is being repeated over and over again by ministers, that everybody who\u2019s involved in parliament is just trying to stop Brexit, defy the people \u2026 I voted for Brexit three times with a deal on these three preliminary points. I think the best thing to do is to produce a majority in parliament on a cross-party basis \u2013 which people would normally approve of the parties co-operating \u2013 to actually have those three points disposed of, leave with that preliminary deal and then have an election and get a government that explains what its long-term negotiations are going to be. He added: You might have to add a referendum on whatever interim withdrawal agreement you reach. I\u2019m not in favour of referendums. Having a referendum with such a simplistic question and answer for such a huge number of complex \u2013 they\u2019re quite technical \u2013 issues has caused all the trouble. But if you had to have a referendum to validate the withdrawal agreement or to decide on what the alternatives are if you don\u2019t, I might resign myself to that. Now, whether enough people would resign themselves to that to get a majority in parliament, I\u2019m not sure. According to the Financial Times\u2019 economics editor, Chris Giles, his paper never calls for \u201cheads to roll in editorials\u201d but, in a thundering piece, it says today: \u201cFaced with such a damning judgment, any premier with a shred of respect for British democracy and the responsibilities of his office would resign.\u201d Good morning, folks. Simon Murphy here taking the helm of the live blog ahead of parliament opening its doors to MPs this morning following the extraordinary supreme court ruling yesterday. Another big day of politics in store \u2026 Quite a lot was made of Lady Hale\u2019s remarkable spider brooch yesterday. There is a lovely piece of analysis from the Guardian\u2019s senior fashion writer and senior social reporter here about what Hale might be telling us with her fashion choice, with a brief history of subversive brooches. Since then, I\u2019ve started seeing a few people adding a spider into their Twitter name. Trudy Harpham has done this and offers this explanation as to why. The stunning supreme court ruling, which found Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament \u201cunlawful\u201d, is unsurprisingly the lead on all the newspapers today, with very mixed takes on the news. Lord Adonis is up, he is angry and he is tweeting. The Labour peer has called the Tories \u201ca revolutionary rabble \u2013 with Eton accents\u201d, published an imagined Queen\u2019s speech, and tweeted a quote from a (real) speech from Margaret Thatcher, in which she asserts the importance of an independent judiciary whose decisions aren\u2019t undermined for the rule of law. From the Labour MP Kevin Brennan Overnight, Boris Johnson delivered his inaugural speech to the UN General Assembly. It was, let\u2019s just say, a remarkable speech. My colleague Graham Russell pulled together a selection of quotes from the address, which was meant to be about the opportunities and challenges of technology, in which Johnson ranged from mattresses that can monitor your nightmares to a diet of \u201cterrifying limbless chickens\u201d. Enjoy. 1. \u201cIn the future, voice connectivity will be in every room and almost every object: your mattress will monitor your nightmares; your fridge will beep for more cheese.\u201d 2. \u201cA future Alexa will pretend to take orders. But this Alexa will be watching you, clucking her tongue and stamping her foot.\u201d 3. \u201cYou may keep secrets from your friends, from your parents, your children, your doctor \u2013 even your personal trainer \u2013 but it takes real effort to conceal your thoughts from Google.\u201d 4. \u201cAI \u2013 what will it mean? Helpful robots washing and caring for an ageing population? Or pink-eyed terminators sent back from the future to cull the human race?\u201d 5. \u201cWhat will synthetic biology stand for \u2013 restoring our livers and our eyes with miracle regeneration of the tissues, like some fantastic hangover cure? Or will it bring terrifying limbless chickens to our tables?\u201d 6. \u201cWhen Prometheus brought fire to mankind. In a tube of fennel, as you may remember, that Zeus punished him by chaining him to a Tartarean crag while his liver was pecked out by an eagle. And every time his liver regrew the eagle came back and pecked it again. And this went on forever \u2013 a bit like the experience of Brexit in the UK, if some of our parliamentarians had their way.\u201d Martin Farrer has written this helpful guide to what happens next in parliament. The full guide is here, but here are the answers to a few key questions: What\u2019s happening with parliament on Wednesday? The president of the UK\u2019s highest court, Lady Hale, announced on Tuesday that \u201cparliament has not been prorogued\u201d. The unanimous judgment of all 11 justices was that it was for parliament - and particularly the speakers of both houses - to decide what to do next. Commons Speaker John Bercow has already said that parliament must be reconvened as a \u201cmatter of urgency\u201dand that MPs will sit at 11.30am. The usual Wednesday session of prime minister\u2019s questions would not take place, he said, although there would be opportunities for MPs to hold the Government to account. What does it mean for Brexit? Corbyn was meeting the leaders of the Scottish Nationalists, Lib Dems and other opposition parties last night to work out how to exert maximum pressure to achieve their number one goal: making sure Johnson cannot escape the legal obligation set out in the Benn-Burt bill to delay Brexit if he has not reached a deal of any description by 19 October. Johnson has always insisted he will not request an extension of article 50 and may be hoping that the EU summit on 17 October will provide a breakthrough. Government ministers have repeatedly dodged questions about whether they think there are loopholes they could use to avoid complying with the Benn legislation. But it would risk another potentially humiliating legal battle with the courts if Johnson chose to go down that route. In a hint he could have another go at suspending parliament he said there was a \u201cgood case for getting on with a Queen\u2019s speech\u201d. Does any of this make an election more likely? Johnson would like to have an election as soon as possible, but he has failed to force the necessary legal instrument through parliament. As he put it, \u201cwe have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to have an election\u201d. The opposition parties don\u2019t want an election until Johnson has asked for the Brexit extension. Their calculation is that Johnson will be weakened by doing so because he has made delivering Brexit on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d the totem of his prime ministership. They can therefore go to the country portraying him as someone who has failed to deliver his promises. Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog. Yesterday was a fairly extraordinary day on both sides of the Atlantic. Just hours after the supreme court handed down its ruling declaring Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament was \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect\u201d, Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry into US president Donald Trump. Quite the day for brash, blonde world leaders. The Supreme Court verdict has meant that Johnson has had to cut short his visit to New York, where he was attending the United Nations general assembly. He is due to arrive in London around lunchtime on Wednesday after an overnight flight. Parliament will resume at 11:30am, with MPs returning to the House of Commons two weeks after it was suspended in chaotic scenes. A government official in New York with the prime minister said it was impossible to say whether Johnson would appear before the Commons. \u201cI would anticipate there would be statements to the house, I\u2019m just not in a position to say what they will be on,\u201d the official said. Downing Street suggested the prime minister would continue to push for a snap general election, while opposition parties attempted to inflict maximum embarrassment on Johnson. \u201cIn the coming days parliament is likely to be put on the spot to see if it will have an election or whether it will continue to keep the country in zombie-parliament stasis. The only way out is an election and they will be given another opportunity to let the public decide if and when we leave the EU,\u201d said a No 10 source. I\u2019ll be at the helm of this blog in the early hours, before I hand it over to my brilliant colleagues. As always, you can get in touch via Twitter or email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). We don\u2019t know what the day will bring, but it\u2019s a fairly sure bet that it will bring drama, so buckle up and thanks for reading along.",

It is unclear what health risk easily ingested microplastics pose to marine life, but researchers fear toxic chemicals in the plastics, and other compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which stick to them, could be harmful to the animals. The particles may also help spread disease-causing viruses and bacteria. The Newcastle team measured the amount of microfibres released from black polyester T-shirts, first in a series of lab tests that mimicked full-scale washing machines, and then in real washing machines at a Procter &amp; Gamble research centre. The results showed that earlier recommendations to use more water and less aggressive washing cycles may actually be releasing more microfibres into the environment. Some washing machine manufacturers are introducing microfibre filters, but Mark Kelly, the first author of the study published in Environmental Science and Technology, said avoiding delicate washes and half loads would help to reduce the amounts of microfibres released by washing. \u201cThis research is important as it helps to identify how microfibres are reaching the marine environment,\u201d said Prof Tamara Galloway, an ecotoxicologist at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the study. \u201cWe have found microplastics in most of the marine animals we study, including turtles, seals and dolphins. Microfibres are the type of microplastics we find most frequently. Whilst we can\u2019t say for sure what the health impacts of ingesting microfibres from textiles might be, minimising exposure has got to be a high priority for protecting the marine environment and the food chain.\u201d",

Really? \u201cVisit a typical independent school classroom with children of any age and you will see a more ethnically diverse group of faces looking back at you than is likely to be the case elsewhere.\u201d However, the headteacher of a state primary school in the south-east of England, speaking anonymously, rejected that claim, saying: \u201cAny state school is more diverse in terms of backgrounds and incomes than the most diverse prep school, even in the wealthiest areas. Prep schools usually offer no bursaries or financial scholarships, they are worse in that respect than public schools.\u201d King\u2019s organisation represents 600 prep and junior schools in England with around 160,000 pupils, educating children up to the age of 13. According to the Independent Schools Council, the average annual fee is just over \u00a313,000 a year for day pupils. In his defence of the sector, he was due to say: \u201cThere is no denying we offer a premium product and there is a cost for this but in turn it produces results. \u201cThere are regional differences, but the state per-pupil primary-age funding level is circa \u00a35,000. The comparable figure for independent schools is two and a half times this. What does this extra per-pupil funding bring apart from excellent facilities? More, specialist teachers from an early age, smaller class sizes and a commitment to the development of the individual.\u201d He contrasts the \u201cMichael Gove-directed changes focused on the rote and robotic\u201d in state schools with the autonomy enjoyed by private school heads, \u201cfree of the shackles of government ministers\u2019 diktat\u201d. \u201cIt is a simple truth that one of the great joys, and indeed responsibilities of being a head in an independent school is that you get the freedom to choose the curriculum and co-curricular shape that is best for the pupils in the school.\u201d The National Association of Head Teachers said all heads faced restrictions on what they could do and teach. \u201cIn almost every case, whether you\u2019re in the state sector or elsewhere, the headteacher\u2019s office comes equipped not just with a desk and chair but a straitjacket too,\u201d the NAHT said in response to King\u2019s speech. \u201cAccountability, funding, data and problems with recruitment \u2013 all well known in the state sector \u2013 all act against school leaders who want to use the freedom and autonomy that come with the role. In the independent sector, there are different problems. \u201cGood leadership is about having a clear plan to overcome whatever obstacles you face in a way that works for you, your school and its pupils.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Everton v Watford Aston Villa v Wolves Manchester City v Southampton Burton Albion v Leicester City Crawley Town v Colchester United Chelsea v Manchester United Oxford v Sunderland Liverpool v Arsenal And with that, I\u2019m gone. It\u2019s been eventful. Here\u2019s one more match report. Bye! A couple of match reports for you: That is a very tasty draw. A couple of massive ties - Chelsea v Manchester United, Liverpool v Arsenal - and one of Crawley or Colchester will be in the quarter-finals! Now it\u2019s the draw for round four! This happened really very quickly, almost as if Sky needed to go to an ad break. Anyway, here it is: Everton v Watford Aston Villa v Wolves Manchester City v Southampton Burton Albion v Leicester City Crawley Town v Colchester United Chelsea v Manchester United Oxford v Sunderland Liverpool v Arsenal So it\u2019s humiliation for West Ham, disaster for Bournemouth, disappointment for Sheffield United but glory for Manchester United, who thrashed Rochdale 5-3 on penalties at Old Trafford. Here are the final final scores: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 1-3 Aston Villa Burton Albion 2-0 Bournemouth Chelsea 7-1 Grimsby Town Manchester United 1-1 Rochdale (Manchester United through on penalties) MK Dons 0-2 Liverpool Oxford United 4-0 West Ham United Sheffield United 0-1 Sunderland Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-1 Reading (Wolves through on penalties) And the final whistle finally sounds at the Pirelli Stadium, where the lights have gone out for Bournemouth! Dan James scores with United\u2019s fifth penalty, and they\u2019re through after a perfect shoot-out! Greenwood also scores from the spot. United\u2019s penalties have been, well, spot on so far. Fred tucks his penalty away, and Morley does likewise. United lead 3-2 after three penalties apiece. A lovely penalty from Pereira, who sidefoots high to his right while the Rochdale keeper goes low to the left! And then Romero saves Rochdale\u2019s second! Rochdale also convert their first penalty, the keeper going the right way but still unable to reach it! The shoot-out is about to get under way at Old Trafford. Juan Mata is to take the first penalty ... and he sends the keeper the wrong way! Some news from our European friends: PSG have lost 2-0 at home to Reims, and Rodrygo has scored a brilliant goal on his debut for Real Madrid, who beat Osasuna 2-0. It\u2019s all over at Old Trafford, and Rochdale have taken Manchester United to a penalty shoot-out! Wolves have won the shoot-out 4-2! At Old Trafford, the game is about to go into stoppage time with Manchester United laying siege to the Rochdale goal! And Reading\u2019s next penalty is sent into orbit! Wolves are in control of this shoot-out now. SAVE! Swift, author of that stoppage-time rabona, has missed his penalty! It\u2019s 1-1 in the shoot out, but Reading have taken two penalties and Wolves only one! Some final scores, and some latest scores, here: Carabao Cup Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 1-3 Aston Villa Burton Albion 2-0 Bournemouth (still playing here) Chelsea 7-1 Grimsby Town Manchester United 1-1 Rochdale (still playing there) MK Dons 0-2 Liverpool Oxford United 4-0 West Ham United Sheffield United 0-1 Sunderland Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-1 Reading (penalties here) Scottish League Cup Celtic 5-0 Partick Thistle Heart of Midlothian 2-2 Aberdeen (extra time being played) Kilmarnock 0-0 Aberdeen (extra time being played) Livingston 0-1 Rangers Reading have equalised with a header from a 99th-minute rabona cross! Into added time at Burton, and there\u2019ll be 28 minutes of it! It starts with a goal, Nathan Broadhead sidefooting in unchallenged at the far post after a low cross from the right! Sky say it was scored in the 72nd minute rather than the 98th. It\u2019s a thrashing! Shandon Baptiste picks up the ball outside the area, skips into it, cuts onto his right foot and sidefoots a shot across goal and in! The keeper doesn\u2019t even bother to dive, which pretty much sums up the state of West Ham\u2019s defending here. Three Premier League sides are through, and one goes out - it\u2019s a tale of Max Power and max humiliation for Sheffield United. Rochdale have only gone and equalised! 16-year-old Luke Mathesonn with it, running onto a looping cross from the left and smashing a volley that bounces into the net! I was just tapping away, composing an update about Chelsea\u2019s sixth goal, scored by Michy Batshuayi, when they run away and score a seventh! It\u2019s the most popular of the night, Callum Hudson-Odoi running into the area before lashing a vicious shot inside the near post! Oxford clear a West Ham corner to the halfway line. A West Ham defender comes across to deal with it, but at the vital moment he falls over, allowing Tariqu Fosu to collect the ball and sprint away, all the way to the West Ham area, round the keeper, and score! West Ham are being humbled here! Meanwhile at Burton, it\u2019s lights, and indeed game, back on! Finally, United take the lead at home to Rochdale! Mason Greenwood gets the ball in the right-hand side of the area, checks onto his left foot and then scores with a low shot inside the near post. The keeper will be disappointed there, methinks. Reece James, given a tiny scrap of pace a few yards outside the area, curls a lovely shot inside the right-hand corner! Bournemouth have got a massive get-out-of-jail card at Burton. Or have they? The lights have failed for a third time at Burton Albion, and this is starting to get silly. Jack Grealish comes off the bench to half-volley Villa back into a two-goal lead from just inside the area! Another save at MK Dons and this time it\u2019s Kelleher who stops the home side getting a foothold in the game! More accurately Bowery hits his leg with a header, with the keeper knowing very little about it, but for a moment there that looked a certain goal. A low cross from the right, and the simplest of tap-ins by Matt Taylor at the far post! Liverpool hit the post! Oxlade-Chamberlain slams in a vicious low 30-yard screamer, which is touched onto the woodwork by the keeper! The lights are back on at the Pirelli Stadium, where Burton are insisting it\u2019s not their fault, and that the entire town has been plunged into darkness (though their own scoreboard, strangely, was not). Incredible Rochdale miss at Old Trafford! They work the ball to the byline, square it to Camps, four yards out, and even though he doesn\u2019t make good contact it still took phenomenal reactions for Wan-Bissaka to hook it clear! Another Milner assist! From the left wing he lifts the ball to the back stick, where Hoever steams in, outjumps everyone else by a massive margin, and thumps in a super header! Meanwhile at Burton the lights come back on, the players come back out, the match restarts and, two minutes later, the floodlights fail again! Brighton pull one back! It\u2019s a corner from the right, turned in from the edge of the six-yard box! That was Oxford\u2019s first shot on target. West Ham immediately bring on Haller, and very nearly go two down! A free kick is tossed into the area, headed across goal, passed around a bit - all this inside the penalty area - crossed back in, and Elliott Moore controls, turns, and surprises the goalkeeper with an early shot that rolls inside the far post! That\u2019s Chelsea home and hosed! Barkley takes a free-kick short, and the ball is crossed from the right wing. I think Grimsby\u2019s No4, Davis, could have dealt with it but he tried to usher the ball across the area to safety and Zouma punished him by flicking out a boot and diverting it in! Floodlight failure! It\u2019s all gone very dark at Burton, where the home side lead Bournemouth 1-0 but, more importantly, need an electrician sharpish. It\u2019s not all goalkeeping howlers: Villa\u2019s Trezeguet has just been denied by a miracle save from Brighton\u2019s Button! \u201cSomeone, for the love of God, make these United players do some rondos in training,\u201d pleads Souradeep Sengupta. \u201cThis is punishing to watch even for hardened fans.\u201d The half-time whistle has now gone at Old Trafford, where Manchester United are being held to a goalless draw with Rochdale. Meanwhile, the other games have all restarted. Five minutes to go until half-time in Paris, and Paris Saint-Germain are 1-0 down to Reims. Here are all the key half-time scores: Carabao Cup Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-2 Aston Villa Burton Albion 1-0 Bournemouth Chelsea 3-1 Grimsby Town Manchester United 0-0 Rochdale (still playing there) MK Dons 0-1 Liverpool Oxford United 0-0 West Ham United Sheffield United 0-1 Sunderland Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-0 Reading Scottish League Cup Celtic 1-0 Partick Thistle Heart of Midlothian 1-2 Aberdeen Kilmarnock 0-0 Aberdeen Livingston 0-1 Rangers Chance for Manchester United! It\u2019s a Greenwood cross from the right that floats onto the head of Pogba, on the edge of the six-yard box, with the keeper leaden-footed at the front stick, but his header floats high! \u201cAny word on the Man Utd game? The Guardian article headline says you are covering it,\u201d wonders Douglas Thiel. Er, no news is good news, right? I can tell you that United have had two shots on target, and Rochdale none. United have just won a corner, though. It is their first of the game. Pedro scores from the spot! As a corner is sent into the area Zouma is blocked at its edge and tumbles, the referee is about two yards away and points to the spot, and Pedro sends the keeper the wrong way! Ross Barkley\u2019s time as designated penalty taker, if it ever existed, appears to be over. Another howler! James Milner, from precisely on the line at the edge of the area, on the left-hand corner, blasts a vicious shot straight at the goalkeeper, who tries to catch it but fails and it skews over his right shoulder and into the net, despite the keeper\u2019s desperate attempt to claw it away! Villa double their lead at the Amex, Hourihane smartly converting a straightforward chance after being teed up by Keinan Davis, whose lungbusting run down the left and into the area was very fine. \u201cGiven Liverpool have raided their academy for tonight\u2019s game v MK, who\u2019s playing in the Checkatrade Trophy match at Fleetwood? The U11s?\u201d wonders Graeme Thorn. Yes, plenty of debuts there as well. That\u2019s a goalkeeping howler! Bruno Jordao\u2019s shot is hard enough, but it\u2019s from crazy distance and straight at the keeper, who inexplicably fumbles it in! Another chance for Liverpool! After Milner laid one on a plate for Elliott, this time Elliott lifts the ball into the area and Milner, from just inside the corner of the six-yard box, heads across goal and wide! Oxford hit the West Ham woodwork! It\u2019s a free-kick from 20 yards or so, which is lifted over the wall but not quite into the net! A hard, low cross from the left is palmed out by the goalkeeper but it goes straight to Jota, who controls and then pummels a low shot into the net! After conceding twice in the opening minutes Grimsby have managed to slow the Chelsea goal train, and now they\u2019re back in the game! It\u2019s an assist from the goalkeeper, and the ball bounces through to Matt Green who volleys an absolute cracker into the top corner from just inside the area! Burton take the lead! It\u2019s a cross from the left, and Sarkic times his run from deep perfectly to meet the ball just as it drops to earth, and he thunders a low half-volley into the net! Incredible miss from Liverpool! Milner does excellently, cutting in from the left, and his low pul-back finds Elliott at the far post, and with another yawning net to aim at he hits the bar! Chance for MK Dons! Hesitation from the keeper, who could surely have claimed the ball and ended the move, and instead it\u2019s pulled back to McGrandles, who shoots over an empty net! Max Power by name, max power by nature! It\u2019s a 20-yarder, and it flies into the top left corner! I think, to be fair, that it was probably only 80% power. And another one! It\u2019s a low ball from the right that arrives behind Batshuayi, but he controls, spins and shoots into the top corner! Chelsea take an early lead! Barkley picks up the ball 10 yards outside the area, with a defender in front of him. So he runs around his opponent, spies empty space in front of him, keeps going into the box and then scores with a low shot inside the near post! Peeeeeep! And they\u2019re off! Out they come now, holding the hands of some lucky young pups who look all kinds of cute in their matchday kits. Yes, it\u2019s the mascots! Matt Dony writes: \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about that Beautiful South song, but I am quite confident that, should injuries affect Liverpool\u2019s backline, Hoever should be able to fill a defensive vacuum.\u201d Here\u2019s a good stat.

Here are the all-important numbers: Liverpool have announced their team, with debuts for Kelleher, Elliott and Brewster, a Keita comeback and all sorts of excitement: Hello world! Last night Tottenham tasted the vile brew that is League Cup humiliation. Tonight Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United will be desperately attempting to avoid a similar fate. The first and last of those are at home, which coupled with having much better players should give them enough of an advantage over their lower-league opposition, though stranger things have definitely happened. Liverpool meanwhile are expected to field an entire classroom of youngsters in Milton Keynes, with Rhian Brewster, Caomhin Kelleher, Curtis Jones, Sepp van den Berg, Yasser Larouci and Ki-Jana Hoever among the teenaged wizards jostling for a place on the team sheet. I know what you\u2019re thinking: Hoever? Didn\u2019t the Beautiful South write a song for him? Anyway, and without further ado, here are tonight\u2019s Carabao Cup fixtures (all 7.45pm BST kick-offs): Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v Aston Villa Burton Albion v Bournemouth Chelsea v Grimsby Town Manchester United v Rochdale (8pm) MK Dons v Liverpool Oxford United v West Ham United Sheffield United v Sunderland Wolverhampton Wanderers v Reading There are also some Scottish League Cup quarter-finals: Celtic v Partick Thistle Heart of Midlothian v Aberdeen Kilmarnock v Aberdeen Livingston v Rangers Plus Real Madrid host Osasuna in La Liga at 8pm, the same time that Paris Saint-Germain host Reims and six Serie A matches will get under way, with Napoli and Internazionale, who will overtake Juventus to go top should they beat Lazio at home, among the teams in action. All in all, it should be a busy night. Welcome!",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 26 September. Top stories Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have conducted a tense open meeting addressing the scandal that prompted an impeachment inquiry against the US president. It caps a difficult day for the Republican party, on which a damning White House memo revealed that Trump had pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to help investigate his political rival Joe Biden, and an internal party briefing note aiming to limit fallout was accidentally emailed to a list including rival House Democrats. Elsewhere, Elizabeth Warren has surged to the front of the Democratic primary field for the 2020 election, after she topped a national poll \u2013 ahead of Biden and Bernie Sanders \u2013 for the first time. Taxpayers spent $2,600 for Barnaby Joyce to charter a flight between Melbourne and Horsham so the former Nationals leader could attend a regional show alongside a local Nationals candidate during the lead-up to the federal election. Joyce attended the Wimmera Machinery Field Day in his capacity as drought envoy, as part of an expenses bill of $675,000 accumulated during nine months in the role. Backpackers in Australia are working in unsafe and gruelling conditions for as little as $4 an hour, according to stories alleging exploitation being shared under the Instagram hashtag #88daysaslave. Visitors under the working holiday scheme have shared more than 5,000 posts, including reports of sexual abuse and underpayment of workers desperate to avoid deportation. The 88 days refers to the time that first-year visa holders must work in regional areas to be eligible for a second-year visa, a program the federal government has hailed as a success after a 20% rise in uptake last year. World A faction of British Conservative MPs have declared \u201ca real sense of doom\u201d over Boris Johnson\u2019s tactics, as the prime minister continued to invite Labour to face a \u201cday of reckoning\u201d by going to an election, while Jeremy Corbyn repeated calls for Johnson to resign. The PM also sparked fury by arguing that the best way of honouring the memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox was to get Brexit done. Italian authorities have closed off roads and evacuated homes after warnings that a portion of the Mont Blanc glacier is at risk of collapse. Up to 250,000 cubic metres of ice is in danger of breaking free, with Europe\u2019s heatwave said to have accelerated the melt. Israel\u2019s president has invited Benjamin Netanyahu to form government, giving the Likud leader six weeks to put together a functioning coalition. Should the 69-year-old fail to do so, it is expected that the opposition leader, Benny Gantz, will also be invited to try. The woman who sparked France\u2019s equivalent of the #MeToo campaign has been found guilty of defaming the man she accused. Ordered to pay \u20ac15,000 in damages to the executive and \u20ac5,000 in legal fees, Sandra Muller has called the ruling a \u201cbackwards step\u201d. Angela Merkel has promised more than half a billion euros to revitalise Germany\u2019s crisis-hit forests after a combination of storms, drought, forest fires and aggressively spreading bark beetle plagues have destroyed 250,000 football fields worth of forest.

Two years ago Richmond ran on to the MCG as heavy underdogs before winning a fairytale first premiership in 37 years. But given the context of their season, Kylie Maslen asks, if they win another flag on Saturday could this one prove even more remarkable? Thinking time: Greta Thunberg\u2019s ferocious courage With just 495 words, Greta Thunberg\u2019s address to the UN\u2019s climate action summit has already resonated much longer than the four and a half minutes it took to deliver.

Cushing gave chances to the Ireland youngster Tyler Toland and the 17-year-old Jess Park, who both impressed, but it was the more experienced Walsh and Beckie partnership that would give the manager the option of resting a few more legs.

A weak attempt at a clearance fell kindly at Beckie\u2019s feet and the Canadian turned and powered a shot high past Bertsch. Bremer added a fourth, and her seventh in all competitions, when she carried the ball from deep, rounded Bertsch and prodded towards goal as she slipped to the ground.</p>",

Cushing gave chances to the Ireland youngster Tyler Toland and the 17-year-old Jess Park, who both impressed, but it was the more experienced Walsh and Beckie partnership that would give the manager the option of resting a few more legs. Walsh broke to the byline before slipping a cross across the face of goal for Beckie to poke in. Cushing was full of praise for Walsh: \u201cI will not hold back, she is up there with the most intelligent players I have worked with. She is pivotal for us.\u201d This was much more comfortable for City. The Nationalliga A runners-up Lugano have become an unlikely home for former US college players. They have 16 Americans in their ranks and 10 were in the starting line up to face City, with English defender Helen Seed the outlier (she too, though, played NCAA football). Former NWSL player Beckie was the difference for City, and just two minutes after the break she had her third. A weak attempt at a clearance fell kindly at Beckie\u2019s feet and the Canadian turned and powered a shot high past Bertsch. Bremer added a fourth, and her seventh in all competitions, when she carried the ball from deep, rounded Bertsch and prodded towards goal as she slipped to the ground.",

      "body": "<p>Just hours after he had been deported a day early from the US, Boris Johnson found himself back in the Commons to give a statement on the supreme court\u2019s judgment. One that he had never wanted or expected to give.</p> <p>The Incredible Sulk came out angry. Sulk shouty. Sulk guilty. There was no contrition. No humility. A normal person would have \u2019fessed up and resigned. But this was the speech of a serial offender \u2013 the narcissistic sociopath \u2013 who couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d been caught red-handed yet again. \u201cI done nothing,\u201d sulked Sulk. He had been fitted up. The supreme court had got it wrong. Technically he was innocent. The electronic tag<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/nothing-spoils-a-crisp-fall-morning-like-a-supreme-court-ruling\"> fitted by Lady Hale the previous day</a> proved otherwise.</p> <p>Lie followed lie. Lying is one of the only things Boris can be trusted to do. The prorogation had been perfectly normal. The Brexit negotiations were well advanced. Everything was going splendidly. The real problem wasn\u2019t him. It was everyone else in Westminster. So give him an election and allow him to break his word on avoiding no deal.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn wasn\u2019t stupid enough to fall for Classic Dom\u2019s last roll of the dice. But even so, his response was half-arsed. To put it kindly. The Labour leader had the prime minister on the ropes. The government\u2019s credibility and integrity were in tatters but he could barely lay a punch. This was two washed-up drunks getting lairy in a pub at closing-time.</p> <p>The Tory benches cheered. But the applause was laden with desperation. They know Johnson is a fraud. They know they\u2019ve made a mistake. Worse, they know they are complicit. They and Johnson are parasitic, their survival dependent on the other. But what neither realises is that they are in a death spiral, draining each other\u2019s lifeblood. The eyes are already dead, their bodies hollowed-out shells.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t even their nadir. That came when Johnson said, \u201chumbug\u201d in response to Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff mentioning the death of Jo Cox. An insult compounded by him insisting the only way to honour her memory was to deliver his Brexit. As if the reward for getting his way was that women would not be murdered. It was one of the most shameful episodes the Commons has witnessed in years. If Tory MPs had an ounce of integrity and self-worth they would force him to resign within hours. If.</p> <p>But they don\u2019t. Many may subconsciously long for a no-confidence vote in The Sulk. Just to have the chance to do one thing in which they believe. But they will be denied. Their self-hatred will tear them apart. The punishment for their failure is their continued existence on life-support under the unforgiving gaze of parliament. And what\u2019s left of their consciences.</p> <p>The Commons had reconvened in the morning with a short \u2013 as in not as long as many had feared \u2013 statement from the Speaker welcoming MPs back to their place of work.

      "bodyText": "Just hours after he had been deported a day early from the US, Boris Johnson found himself back in the Commons to give a statement on the supreme court\u2019s judgment. One that he had never wanted or expected to give. The Incredible Sulk came out angry. Sulk shouty. Sulk guilty. There was no contrition. No humility. A normal person would have \u2019fessed up and resigned. But this was the speech of a serial offender \u2013 the narcissistic sociopath \u2013 who couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d been caught red-handed yet again. \u201cI done nothing,\u201d sulked Sulk. He had been fitted up. The supreme court had got it wrong. Technically he was innocent. The electronic tag fitted by Lady Hale the previous day proved otherwise. Lie followed lie. Lying is one of the only things Boris can be trusted to do. The prorogation had been perfectly normal. The Brexit negotiations were well advanced. Everything was going splendidly. The real problem wasn\u2019t him. It was everyone else in Westminster. So give him an election and allow him to break his word on avoiding no deal. Jeremy Corbyn wasn\u2019t stupid enough to fall for Classic Dom\u2019s last roll of the dice. But even so, his response was half-arsed. To put it kindly. The Labour leader had the prime minister on the ropes. The government\u2019s credibility and integrity were in tatters but he could barely lay a punch. This was two washed-up drunks getting lairy in a pub at closing-time. The Tory benches cheered. But the applause was laden with desperation. They know Johnson is a fraud. They know they\u2019ve made a mistake. Worse, they know they are complicit. They and Johnson are parasitic, their survival dependent on the other. But what neither realises is that they are in a death spiral, draining each other\u2019s lifeblood. The eyes are already dead, their bodies hollowed-out shells. This wasn\u2019t even their nadir. That came when Johnson said, \u201chumbug\u201d in response to Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff mentioning the death of Jo Cox. An insult compounded by him insisting the only way to honour her memory was to deliver his Brexit. As if the reward for getting his way was that women would not be murdered. It was one of the most shameful episodes the Commons has witnessed in years. If Tory MPs had an ounce of integrity and self-worth they would force him to resign within hours. If. But they don\u2019t. Many may subconsciously long for a no-confidence vote in The Sulk. Just to have the chance to do one thing in which they believe. But they will be denied. Their self-hatred will tear them apart. The punishment for their failure is their continued existence on life-support under the unforgiving gaze of parliament. And what\u2019s left of their consciences. The Commons had reconvened in the morning with a short \u2013 as in not as long as many had feared \u2013 statement from the Speaker welcoming MPs back to their place of work. Then the first act of the day\u2019s drama got under way. It was just that no one had told the attorney general if he was appearing in a tragedy or a farce as he answered an urgent question on his legal advice to the government over prorogation. Little more than a year ago, Geoffrey Cox had been just another MP with a crazy dream. But then he had won Westminster\u2019s Got Talent \u2013 exclusively available on Hacker House TV, just dial 0800 and get a recorded message redirecting you to a woman in Florida \u2013 and had become its leading actor. The man with the golden voice. A shining beacon of intelligence in a cabinet of low voltage mediocrities. Today he blew it. A Star has Died. Cox began by channelling his inner Ibsen in An Enemy of the People. The supreme court had ruled and the government would abide by its decision. The outcome hadn\u2019t been as he and other members of the legal team had hoped and it was a matter of deep, deep personal regret that he found himself unable to disclose what his own advice had been. \u201cNo one is suggesting for a moment that the supreme court has staged a constitutional coup,\u201d he declared, happy to make a passive-aggressive attack on Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had done just that 24 hours previously. Just for the fun of it. Shares in the leader in the house have steadily tumbled since he\u2019s been elevated to the cabinet. Rees-Mogg shuffled awkwardly on the frontbench. Where was nanny when you needed her? So far, so good. But then Cox spoiled it all by insisting the government had at all times acted in good faith. Not even the dopiest Tory backbenchers believed that. As if trying to cover up this schoolboy error, Cox then went full-on space cadet. What followed was Brian Blessed appearing in a village hall farce, while out of his head on acid. The arms started flailing and spit dribbled from his lips as the hallucinations became ever more intense. Then he went into spasms and rolled on the floor. The spiders, the spiders! They were everywhere, crawling up the walls. The hollow laughs of 11 Lady Hales echoed in his head. Parliament was a dead parliament. An ex-parliament with no moral right to sit. The government couldn\u2019t govern. Several MPs gently tried to talk him down by explaining the reason it couldn\u2019t govern was entirely the government\u2019s own fault for shedding 21 of its own MPs. No luck.

After Corbyn\u2019s stinging critique, Johnson hit back with an extended political attack on the leader of the opposition, accusing him of running scared \u2013 to which many Conservative MPs responded with rowdy cheers and an extended round of applause. \u201cWhy won\u2019t they allow him to unleash his charms on the electorate? Is it because they are not only terrified that he is going to lose but also even more terrified of the remote possibility that he might win.\u201d \u201cHe can\u2019t control his own party. He can\u2019t decide whether he is for leave or for remain. He\u2019s being held captive by his colleagues,\u201d he said. Johnson was the fourth minister to address parliament on Wednesday, as MPs took the opportunity to press the government on a series of other issues, including the collapse of travel company Thomas Cook and the situation in Iran. Earlier, the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who advised the government that an extended suspension of parliament would be lawful according to advice leaked on Wednesday, launched an extraordinary attack on MPs. \u201cThis parliament is a dead parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on these green benches.\u201d",

company on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter then sat.</p> <p>Trump tells Zelenskiy that he will receive calls from Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, and William Barr, the attorney general, to talk about \u201cthe way they shut your very good prosecutor down\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that,\u201d Trump says, \u201cso whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d</p> <p>Zelenskiy replies: \u201cI understand and I\u2019m knowledgeable about the

asked Zelenskiy for something in return for US aid. Analysts said that no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d was necessary for the solicitation by Trump to be inappropriate and illegal \u2013 and also, there is a clear quid pro quo being negotiated.</p> <p>According to the summary, Trump begins the call by highlighting US aid for Ukraine, which he had suspended without clear explanation in advance of the call. \u201cWe spend a lot of effort and a lot of time,\u201d Trump says \u2013 but then he suggests Ukraine isn\u2019t doing enough in return.</p> <p>\u201cThe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Then Zelenskiy says Ukraine wants to buy more Javelin missiles from the United States, and Trump replies: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/extract/index.html?document-title=&amp;extract=I%20will%20say%20that%20we%20do%20a%20lot%20for%20Ukraine.%20We%20spend%20a%20lot%20of%20effort%20and%20a%20lot%20of%20time.%20Much%20more%20than%20the%20European%20countries%20are%20doing%20and%20they%20should%20be%20helping%20you%20more%20than%20they%20are%20%E2%80%A6%20so%20I%20think%20it%E2%80%99s%20something%20you%20want%20to%20look%20at%20but%20the%20United%20States%20has%20been%20very%20very%20good%20to%20Ukraine.%20I%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20say%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20reciprocal%20necessarily%20because%20things%20are%20happening%20that%20are%20not%20good%20but%20the%20United%20States%20has%20been%20very%20very%20good%20to%20Ukraine.\" data-alt=\"i will say\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/extract/index.html?document-title=&extract=I%20will%20say%20that%20we%20do%20a%20lot%20for%20Ukraine.%20We%20spend%20a%20lot%20of%20effort%20and%20a%20lot%20of%20time.%20Much%20more%20than%20the%20European%20countries%20are%20doing%20and%20they%20should%20be%20helping%20you%20more%20than%20they%20are%20%E2%80%A6%20so%20I%20think%20it%E2%80%99s%20something%20you%20want%20to%20look%20at%20but%20the%20United%20States%20has%20been%20very%20very%20good%20to%20Ukraine.%20I%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20say%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20reciprocal%20necessarily%20because%20things%20are%20happening%20that%20are%20not%20good%20but%20the%20United%20States%20has%20been%20very%20very%20good%20to%20Ukraine.\">i will say</a> </figure>    <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/extract/index.html?document-title=&amp;extract=Zelenskiy%3A%20I%20would%20also%20like%20to%20thank%20you%20for%20your%20great%20support%20in%20the%20area%20of%20defense.%20We%20are%20ready%20to%20continue%20to%20cooperate%20for%20the%20next%20steps%20specifically%20we%20are%20almost%20ready%20to%20buy%20more%20Javelins%20from%20the%20United%20States%20for%20defense%20purposes.%0A%0ATrump%3A%20I%20would%20like%20you%20to%20do%20us%20a%20favor%20though%20because%20our%20country%20has%20been%20through%20a%20lot%20and%20Ukraine%20knows%20a%20lot%20about%20it.\" data-alt=\"zelenskiy - i would like to thank you\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/extract/index.html?document-title=&extract=Zelenskiy%3A%20I%20would%20also%20like%20to%20thank%20you%20for%20your%20great%20support%20in%20the%20area%20of%20defense.%20We%20are%20ready%20to%20continue%20to%20cooperate%20for%20the%20next%20steps%20specifically%20we%20are%20almost%20ready%20to%20buy%20more%20Javelins%20from%20the%20United%20States%20for%20defense%20purposes.%0A%0ATrump%3A%20I%20would%20like%20you%20to%20do%20us%20a%20favor%20though%20because%20our%20country%20has%20been%20through%20a%20lot%20and%20Ukraine%20knows%20a%20lot%20about%20it.\">zelenskiy - i would like to thank you</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>3) It\u2019s not a \u2018</strong><strong>transcript</strong><strong>\u2019 \u2013 and there appear to be significant elisions</strong></h2> <p>While Trump and his allies are referring to the call summary as a transcript, it is not. Instead, the document is a \u201cmemorandum of telephone conversation\u201d kept by notetakers in the White House situation room. A note on the document advises: \u201cA memorandum of a telephone conversation (Telcon) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion\u201d and warns \u201ca number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record\u201d.</p> <p>Prosecutors emphasized that beyond the call summary, it was paramount for Congress to obtain an unredacted version of a report filed by a whistleblower about Trump\u2019s Ukraine contacts, because the report probably contains additional information and context not available in the summary.</p> <p>But the summary itself appears to omit potentially valuable material.

Trump does not discuss with Zelenskiy the countries\u2019 supposedly aligned policies on Russia and counter-terrorism.

      "bodyText": "The White House on Wednesday released a five-page summary of a 30-minute call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that lies at the heart of the growing impeachment process. Here are five key takeaways: 1) Trump asks Zelenskiy for dirt on Biden and his son The call summary establishes that Trump solicited help from a foreign power against a domestic political opponent, in apparent violation of both statutory law and, as the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said Wednesday, \u201cthe integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security\u201d. In the summary, Trump presses Zelenskiy to help stand up a debunked conspiracy theory that the former vice-president Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to shelve an investigation of an energy company on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter then sat. Trump tells Zelenskiy that he will receive calls from Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, and William Barr, the attorney general, to talk about \u201cthe way they shut your very good prosecutor down\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that,\u201d Trump says, \u201cso whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d Zelenskiy replies: \u201cI understand and I\u2019m knowledgeable about the situation.\u201d 2) Trump ties his request to US aid Trump and his defenders claimed the call summary did not feature a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d deal in which Trump asked Zelenskiy for something in return for US aid. Analysts said that no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d was necessary for the solicitation by Trump to be inappropriate and illegal \u2013 and also, there is a clear quid pro quo being negotiated. According to the summary, Trump begins the call by highlighting US aid for Ukraine, which he had suspended without clear explanation in advance of the call. \u201cWe spend a lot of effort and a lot of time,\u201d Trump says \u2013 but then he suggests Ukraine isn\u2019t doing enough in return. \u201cThe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily \u2026\u201d Then Zelenskiy says Ukraine wants to buy more Javelin missiles from the United States, and Trump replies: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\u201d 3) It\u2019s not a \u2018transcript\u2019 \u2013 and there appear to be significant elisions While Trump and his allies are referring to the call summary as a transcript, it is not. Instead, the document is a \u201cmemorandum of telephone conversation\u201d kept by notetakers in the White House situation room. A note on the document advises: \u201cA memorandum of a telephone conversation (Telcon) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion\u201d and warns \u201ca number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record\u201d. Prosecutors emphasized that beyond the call summary, it was paramount for Congress to obtain an unredacted version of a report filed by a whistleblower about Trump\u2019s Ukraine contacts, because the report probably contains additional information and context not available in the summary. But the summary itself appears to omit potentially valuable material. Previous reporting on the call had Trump pressing Zelenskiy about Biden \u201ceight times\u201d \u2013 more than represented in the call summary. The summary also includes a single ellipsis, coming just when Trump explicitly asks Zelenskiy to \u201clook into\u201d Biden. A tweet that raised questions about that ellipsis was retweeted Wednesday by a lawyer for the whistleblower, Mark S Zaid. 4) Trump describes past and future coordination In the call summary, Trump lays out a plan for cooperation with Ukraine against Biden and Democrats that includes past conversations with Giuliani and future anticipated meetings, with Trump extending an invitation to Washington and Zelenskiy inviting the president to Kyiv. The extent of that planning could make it more difficult for Trump in the future to deny or cast doubt on the intentions behind the call, on his side. 5) Trump does not talk about US regional interests One key takeaway from the call summary is what was not part of the conversation. Trump does not discuss with Zelenskiy the countries\u2019 supposedly aligned policies on Russia and counter-terrorism. They don\u2019t discuss Nato, in which Ukraine has in the past sought membership, or energy policy, apart from a mention by Zelenskiy that Ukraine buys US oil. Trump is focused on two things: Biden, and the US firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the last election to analyze an infiltration of DNC email networks. Trump makes a reference to CrowdStrike servers being inside Ukraine, apparently based on a conspiracy theory separate from the Hunter Biden one. So on Trump\u2019s side, the conversation was used to pursue two conspiracy theories. On Zelenskiy\u2019s side, the main objective seems to be to flatter Trump into submission.",

      "body": "<p>An angry and disturbingly pumped-up Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the court in the recalled House of Commons tonight was an act of total contempt \u2013 for the courts, for parliament and ultimately for public and political decency. For the time being, Johnson still retains much of the formal power of the prime minister. But the role\u2019s inner power, its moral authority, the holder\u2019s ability to govern and his meaningful capacity to represent the country are practically shot. There is nothing tragic about this for Johnson personally. There is everything tragic for the country that never asked for him to become its leader.</p> <p>He can\u2019t blame the judges, because he does not dare. He likes to blame MPs, because they are an easy target. But the real blame lies with himself and the Tory hard leavers.</p> <p>On Tuesday, in the immediate aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">supreme </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">court\u2019s unanimous finding</a> that Johnson\u2019s attempt to silence parliament was unlawful and void, it was still just possible to suppose that the prime minister\u2019s instant reaction in New York was merely foolish and off-the-cuff. While claiming to respect the court, Johnson and his lieutenants had gone into instant denial. Johnson announced that he \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/boris-johnson-may-renew-attempt-to-suspend-parliament\" title=\"\">disagreed profoundly</a>\u201d with the ruling, as if that disagreement was in any way relevant. Meanwhile in London, Downing Street charged the justices with extending their reach into political matters, and Jacob Rees-Mogg was alleged to have described the ruling as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/25/boris-johnson-flies-to-uk-as-parliament-returns-after-court-ruling-politics-live?page=with:block-5d8b30228f084ab84172cb78#block-5d8b30228f084ab84172cb78\" title=\"\">constitutional coup</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps, after sleeping on the matter, and with the prospect of a resumed parliamentary session in front of them, there was a possibility that the Johnson government would adopt a humbler and more contrite tone in the light of day today. Not a bit of it. First, with Johnson still in the air over the Atlantic, Michael Gove went on a media round and announced that the government had done nothing wrong in suspending parliament in the way that the court had ruled against. Then the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, told the reassembled MPs that the government had acted in good faith, refused to rule out a further prorogation, and then lost it altogether, dismissing parliament as \u201cdead\u201d, \u201ca disgrace\u201d and possessing \u201cno moral right to sit\u201d.</p> <p>These were merely the warm-up acts for Johnson\u2019s own eventual appearance in the Commons this evening. But they had already pointed unerringly to the strategy that the prime minister was to adopt and which, it was now clear, he had intended to adopt from the very start when he spoke in New York. That strategy was that this is now a naked political fight to the death with the opposition and with the unbelievers. He is not interested in any of the issues on which the judges ruled. All that matters to him is to wade through chaos to Brexit. The twin objectives of the Johnson government when it took office after the ousting of Theresa May \u2013 Brexit by the end of October and a general election fought on a \u201cpeople versus the elites\u201d platform \u2013 remain utterly unchanged by the supreme court ruling.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s two-month premiership has been based on an audacious and slightly crazy plan. It still is based on it today, even after Tuesday\u2019s humiliation. That plan is the overriding need, as the Tory right sees it, to deliver Brexit after three years, and in so doing marginalise the Brexit party in a general election. The as yet insuperable problem with the plan is that it is fuelled wholly by the kind of bravado and pomposity that Johnson displayed this evening. There is a hung parliament, which means the Johnson Conservatives cannot get their own way without compromises they are not prepared to make. And there is the rule of law, which means they cannot ignore the constitution and the courts.</p> <p>To Johnson, these are merely distractions. His objective remains to achieve his two goals by hook or by crook, come what may. If parliament supports him, fine.

      "bodyText": "An angry and disturbingly pumped-up Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the court in the recalled House of Commons tonight was an act of total contempt \u2013 for the courts, for parliament and ultimately for public and political decency. For the time being, Johnson still retains much of the formal power of the prime minister. But the role\u2019s inner power, its moral authority, the holder\u2019s ability to govern and his meaningful capacity to represent the country are practically shot. There is nothing tragic about this for Johnson personally. There is everything tragic for the country that never asked for him to become its leader. He can\u2019t blame the judges, because he does not dare. He likes to blame MPs, because they are an easy target. But the real blame lies with himself and the Tory hard leavers. On Tuesday, in the immediate aftermath of the supreme court\u2019s unanimous finding that Johnson\u2019s attempt to silence parliament was unlawful and void, it was still just possible to suppose that the prime minister\u2019s instant reaction in New York was merely foolish and off-the-cuff. While claiming to respect the court, Johnson and his lieutenants had gone into instant denial. Johnson announced that he \u201cdisagreed profoundly\u201d with the ruling, as if that disagreement was in any way relevant. Meanwhile in London, Downing Street charged the justices with extending their reach into political matters, and Jacob Rees-Mogg was alleged to have described the ruling as a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. Perhaps, after sleeping on the matter, and with the prospect of a resumed parliamentary session in front of them, there was a possibility that the Johnson government would adopt a humbler and more contrite tone in the light of day today. Not a bit of it. First, with Johnson still in the air over the Atlantic, Michael Gove went on a media round and announced that the government had done nothing wrong in suspending parliament in the way that the court had ruled against. Then the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, told the reassembled MPs that the government had acted in good faith, refused to rule out a further prorogation, and then lost it altogether, dismissing parliament as \u201cdead\u201d, \u201ca disgrace\u201d and possessing \u201cno moral right to sit\u201d. These were merely the warm-up acts for Johnson\u2019s own eventual appearance in the Commons this evening. But they had already pointed unerringly to the strategy that the prime minister was to adopt and which, it was now clear, he had intended to adopt from the very start when he spoke in New York. That strategy was that this is now a naked political fight to the death with the opposition and with the unbelievers. He is not interested in any of the issues on which the judges ruled. All that matters to him is to wade through chaos to Brexit. The twin objectives of the Johnson government when it took office after the ousting of Theresa May \u2013 Brexit by the end of October and a general election fought on a \u201cpeople versus the elites\u201d platform \u2013 remain utterly unchanged by the supreme court ruling. Johnson\u2019s two-month premiership has been based on an audacious and slightly crazy plan. It still is based on it today, even after Tuesday\u2019s humiliation. That plan is the overriding need, as the Tory right sees it, to deliver Brexit after three years, and in so doing marginalise the Brexit party in a general election. The as yet insuperable problem with the plan is that it is fuelled wholly by the kind of bravado and pomposity that Johnson displayed this evening. There is a hung parliament, which means the Johnson Conservatives cannot get their own way without compromises they are not prepared to make. And there is the rule of law, which means they cannot ignore the constitution and the courts. To Johnson, these are merely distractions. His objective remains to achieve his two goals by hook or by crook, come what may. If parliament supports him, fine. But if parliament opposes him, he will simply bank the defeat and use it to accuse MPs of being determined to frustrate the 2016 vote. Similarly, if the law supports him, that is fine too. But if it doesn\u2019t \u2013 and this week it has not \u2013 then this too becomes part of the narrative that sees Johnson as the tribune of the leave majority and the courts as part of the resentful, threatened remain minority of establishment bad losers. There are loud echoes here of Donald Trump\u2019s response to this week\u2019s early moves to impeach him. It may have been tempting, especially for liberals, to imagine that an event like an impeachment process or the supreme court ruling will be generally seen as disturbing enough to change the public mood.

      "bodyText": "Wally Downes has been suspended indefinitely from his role as AFC Wimbledon manager after he was accused of breaking the Football Association\u2019s betting rules. Downes has been charged with contravening rule E8 and is alleged to have placed eight bets on football matches between November 2013 and July of this year. During this period Downes had worked briefly as a coach at Queens Park Rangers before later taking on his role at AFC Wimbledon, where he helped the club avoid relegation from League One last season. The FA would not comment on the contents of the charges, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. But in a statement the club said they had suspended Downes due to the \u201cseriousness\u201d of the allegations and would be conducting their own investigation into his conduct. In a statement, the club said: \u201cManager Wally Downes has been suspended from first-team duties pending further notice. Given the seriousness of this breach in FA regulations, the club has decided to suspend Wally with immediate effect, giving time for the club and Dons Trust boards to look at the allegations more closely and make a further announcement in due course.\u201d AFC Wimbledon are struggling again, second bottom in League One having taken just three points from their first 10 games. The club confirmed that Downes\u2019s assistant, Glyn Hodges, will take charge of this weekend\u2019s fixture at Peterborough. Any action taken against Downes will be closely scrutinised after recent high-profile cases under the FA\u2019s betting rules, tightened in 2014 to prevent any player, coach or official in England\u2019s top eight divisions betting on any football-related activity anywhere in the world, led to lenient punishments. This summer, an independent regulatory commission found Daniel Sturridge guilty of passing insider information on a possible transfer to Sevilla to his brother for the purposes of betting. The punishment, however, was a \u00a375,000 fine and a six\u2011week ban from playing, four of them suspended, which was served during the close-season break. The sports minister Tracey Crouch subsequently described the ruling as having made \u201ca mockery of the FA\u2019s rules\u201d. In June Paul Scholes was fined \u00a38,000 after placing 140 bets worth \u00a326,159 during his time as a director of Salford City. In deciding the punishment, the FA accepted Scholes\u2019s mitigating argument that he had not realised the full scope of the betting rules.",

      "bodyText": "Opposition MPs are discussing plans to force Boris Johnson to request a Brexit extension earlier than the current 19 October deadline. MPs returned to Westminster on Wednesday after the government\u2019s suspension of parliament was declared unlawful. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, said her party was looking at ways of legislating in parliament to remove the threat of no deal more quickly than the date set out in the Hilary Benn act. Speaking outside Westminster, she said: \u201cWe have a prime minister who has abused our democracy, who has been found guilty of breaking the law, unlawfully proroguing parliament. And so he has proved time and again that he simply cannot be trusted. \u201cLiberal Democrats will be working with and talking with people across the different parties to find a way to remove that threat of a no-deal Brexit more quickly. It\u2019s vital we do this for our country\u2019s future.\u201d The idea was backed by the Scottish National party\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who said the party\u2019s aim was to \u201ccreate the circumstances that we can give that guarantee the article 50 process is going to be extended and we have an early election\u201d. He added: \u201cIf anybody brings forward a bill then of course that\u2019s amendable.\u201d Blackford, whose party has 35 MPs, said Jeremy Corbyn was the \u201cright and proper\u201d person to lead calls for a Brexit extension and immediate election, but that any future cooperation would be on the proviso that Labour supported a second independence referendum in Scotland. He said: \u201cJeremy and John [McDonnell] have made supportive noises over the course of the last few weeks in terms of recognising that.\u201d MPs have returned to parliament after the supreme court ruled that Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension was unlawful. It is understood opposition parties could seek to amend the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019, which was introduced by Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee, and passed this month before Johnson suspended parliament. The act gives Johnson until 19 October to either pass a deal in parliament or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit. If he fails to do either then he will be forced to ask for an extension to the UK\u2019s departure date from 31 October to 31 January 2020. With no working Commons majority for the government, MPs are emboldened to try to use their numbers and legislative tactics to force Johnson to act. The shadow cabinet met on Wednesday morning to consider Labour\u2019s tactics. Corbyn is keen to secure a general election as soon as possible, once the threat of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October has been definitively ruled out \u2013 though some Labour MPs would prefer a referendum to be held first. If an extension is requested and agreed before 19 October, Labour would then be likely to support a general election. Corbyn gave a rousing speech at Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton on Tuesday, urging party activists to \u201cgo forward to win an election for the people of this country\u201d. His close ally Richard Burgon said on Wednesday that Labour would support an election, \u201conce the extension preventing no deal is nailed down\u201d \u2013 which he said could be \u201cright after the EU summit. Or sooner if the extension is sorted before\u201d. Swinson said: \u201cThere\u2019s various different ways we can do this and I think if anything has been shown in the last few weeks and months it\u2019s that parliament can be innovative and inventive. \u201cWe saw in September the House of Commons take control of the order paper to pass a piece of legislation and that\u2019s the type of way forward that may well enable us to take the threat of a no-deal Brexit off the table much sooner than 19 October.\u201d There is mounting concern among some MPs that the Benn act may contain legal loopholes and that there are several weeks remaining until no deal is officially removed as a threat. Other ways MPs might box in the prime minister and compel him to act over Brexit emerged on Wednesday morning. Remain-backing MPs could apply to the high court asking for a government official to go to Brussels if Johnson has not brought back a deal by 19 October and refuses to request an article 50 extension. It is understood that an application would be made at the Royal Courts of Justice to direct a high-ranking civil servant, possibly the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to carry out parliament\u2019s duty.",

The Bank of England estimates that the shock of a hard Brexit would see GDP decline by about 5.5%, an economic shock comparable to the 2008 financial crash. Then the UK economy took five years to get back to the size it was before the recession \u2013 and wages have yet to recover in real terms for the average worker. In his book Beyond Brexit, Vernon Bogdanor warns that in leaving the EU, Britain could again become a country with no legal remedy for breaches of human rights. At present, when courts make a declaration of incompatibility between convention rights and British law, ministers act to put things right. That might not be the case in the years ahead. We could become a \u201cparadise for an overweening executive\u201d. Brexit populism is pouring arsenic into the water supply of our national conversation. Brexit raised questions that it cannot answer because it identified problems that politicians did not recognise and were unprepared to solve. They should start. Only dullness in parliamentary government can heal the divisions.",

      "bodyText": "Privatisation of NHS care will be significantly curbed under confidential plans that health service bosses expect Downing Street to include in the Queen\u2019s speech next month. Local NHS bodies in England would no longer have to put out to tender any contract worth at least \u00a3615,278. That requirement has contributed to a big increase in outsourcing of services and a record \u00a39.2bn of the NHS\u2019s budget now being handed to private firms. Under NHS England\u2019s proposals, Boris Johnson would have to scrap key elements of Andrew Lansley\u2019s shake-up of the NHS in England in 2012, which bitterly divided the then coalition government. The Guardian has obtained an NHS England document which summarises 22 key changes it believes will be included in an NHS reform bill due to be published next month. A twin-pronged attempt to severely restrict future privatisation would involve scrapping section 75 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and removing the commissioning of healthcare services from the remit of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015. The proposals also seek to limit the role of competition between different parts of the NHS, which critics claim has proved costly, damaging and a distraction from caring for patients. The proposals are likely to gain government backing because NHS England was asked to draw them up by Theresa May when she was prime minister, in order to allow changes in how the health service operates to go ahead as part of its ambition under the long-term plan to integrate care. \u201cThis is long overdue.

He\u2019d be like, \u2018You\u2019re this, you\u2019re that,\u2019\u201d he says, furrowing his brow and pointing his finger in mimicking accusation. While his father might not have been around much, Naidu carried him everywhere.</p> <p>Naidu weighed 270kg at the time, and absorbed any messages that affirmed the way he already felt. \u201cI still have shades of anxiety, but at that point it was extreme.\u201d His mental health was dipping; he remembers thinking about suicide. \u201cAt that point in Adelaide, I had probably two friends. When I dropped out of high school, I told them that I moved to the country. I didn\u2019t want to see anybody.\u201d</p> <p>He returns to that time in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzmhWnApKns\">17 Again</a>, which became a surprise hit on Triple J in 2017: \u201cBack when I was 17, I stopped trying to kill myself,\u201d he sings. The song set him off on a trajectory that seemed impossible as a teenage shut-in. In it, he name-drops the hip-hop act Hilltop Hoods; a year later, he was on stage collecting an Aria with them, for their song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_XVw0235gY\">Clark Griswold</a>; in November he\u2019ll be joining the Adelaide stalwarts on a US tour.</p> <p>Adelaide is an integral part of Naidu\u2019s origin story. He\u2019s a Crows supporter, and names the players who have reached out with love for his music, and one who came to a hometown show. His latest single, Housing Trust, is named for the South Australian public housing that put a roof over Naidu\u2019s and his mother\u2019s heads. \u201cIf diamonds come from pressure, I\u2019ll glow,\u201d he sings in his earnest, treacly voice, painting a vivid sonic watercolour of what their lives were like.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o8MoNUQCMU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4o8MoNUQCMU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The \u201cstreet-gospel\u201d style of Naidu\u2019s music extends beyond the songs, weaving into his conversation. At times, when he speaks, he drops the kind of inspirational aphorisms you might find stamped inside a travel journal or scrawled inside a congratulatory card.</p> <p>But considering what he has overcome on the road to finding his voice, I find myself listening without any cynicism. Still being here is success in itself \u2013 and anything Naidu is able to do with his time seems like an incredible bonus. \u201cMy first intention is for me,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic has to heal parts of me before it can do anything else.

He\u2019d be like, \u2018You\u2019re this, you\u2019re that,\u2019\u201d he says, furrowing his brow and pointing his finger in mimicking accusation. While his father might not have been around much, Naidu carried him everywhere. Naidu weighed 270kg at the time, and absorbed any messages that affirmed the way he already felt. \u201cI still have shades of anxiety, but at that point it was extreme.\u201d His mental health was dipping; he remembers thinking about suicide. \u201cAt that point in Adelaide, I had probably two friends. When I dropped out of high school, I told them that I moved to the country. I didn\u2019t want to see anybody.\u201d He returns to that time in 17 Again, which became a surprise hit on Triple J in 2017: \u201cBack when I was 17, I stopped trying to kill myself,\u201d he sings. The song set him off on a trajectory that seemed impossible as a teenage shut-in. In it, he name-drops the hip-hop act Hilltop Hoods; a year later, he was on stage collecting an Aria with them, for their song Clark Griswold; in November he\u2019ll be joining the Adelaide stalwarts on a US tour. Adelaide is an integral part of Naidu\u2019s origin story. He\u2019s a Crows supporter, and names the players who have reached out with love for his music, and one who came to a hometown show. His latest single, Housing Trust, is named for the South Australian public housing that put a roof over Naidu\u2019s and his mother\u2019s heads. \u201cIf diamonds come from pressure, I\u2019ll glow,\u201d he sings in his earnest, treacly voice, painting a vivid sonic watercolour of what their lives were like. The \u201cstreet-gospel\u201d style of Naidu\u2019s music extends beyond the songs, weaving into his conversation. At times, when he speaks, he drops the kind of inspirational aphorisms you might find stamped inside a travel journal or scrawled inside a congratulatory card. But considering what he has overcome on the road to finding his voice, I find myself listening without any cynicism. Still being here is success in itself \u2013 and anything Naidu is able to do with his time seems like an incredible bonus. \u201cMy first intention is for me,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic has to heal parts of me before it can do anything else. I feel like the longer I get to live, the more I\u2019ll be able to know myself.\u201d \u2022 Mama by Adrian Eagle is out now on Island/Universal. The singer is touring Australia with Tones &amp; I in September, and the US with Hilltop Hoods in November and December. He returns to Australia for Falls festival and his EP tour, which kicks off in January 2020 \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",

      "bodyText": "When the governor of the Reserve Bank speaks, the market listens, trying to sift the gold dust out from the dirt for any signs of a movement in interest rates. And from Philip Lowe\u2019s speech in Armidale on Tuesday, the market has very clearly sifted out a rate cut next week, as more evidence comes that fiscal and monetary policy are not working in the same direction. The economy, as we all have a fair idea, is not performing as it should. Yes, employment is growing well \u2013 which is always a good thing \u2013 but overall GDP, productivity and inflation growth are all weak. Wages growth remains equally slow, and given the recent increase in underutilisation, there is no sense of this changing anytime soon. We have a government rather joyfully talking up a budget surplus for this financial year, which by definition is removing growth from the economy. And so, what is left? Monetary policy \u2013 and it seems likely to be used again. When Lowe suggested at the end of his speech that \u201cthe board is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, make further progress towards full employment, and achieve the inflation target over time\u201d, everyone in the market said: \u201cThanks for the nod and the wink, Philip\u201d. As it is, the market had already been pricing in a pretty decent chance (76%) of a rate cut on 1 October: And as a general rule the RBA does not surprise the market by not cutting rates. The market is slightly more optimistic about things than it was six weeks ago, when it was sure of a further cut to 0.5% by February next year. Now they only see that occurring by May. The governor noted that there have been clear signs recently that the issue of flat real income growth is translating into our spending habits. He said the \u201cpersistent slow growth in household income has led many people to reassess how fast their incomes will increase in the future. As they have done this, they have also reassessed their spending, particularly on discretionary items\u201d: There has also been a sharp fall in the sales of houses \u2013 the drop in house prices has been halted somewhat but growth in the overall number of houses being sold is as low as it has been since the early 1990s. As a result, he noted, \u201cwith fewer of us moving homes, spending on new furniture and household appliances has been quite soft\u201d. In effect, the rise in house price data is from a smaller than usual number of houses being sold \u2013 and thus perhaps tells us less about the housing market than we think. It is not so much a recovery as a niche improvement. A look at housing credit growth shows that, even with the improvement in June and July, monthly growth remains very weak \u2013 and investors continue to leave the market: But the bigger issue for the RBA is business investment. Lowe suggested that \u201cwe will all be better off if businesses have the confidence to expand, invest, innovate and hire people.\u201d The current annual growth of business credit is below 5% \u2013 a level associated with very weak economic conditions \u2013 and a place where we have been now for most of the past decade: This is an issue not just of businesses unwilling to grasp the \u201canimal spirits\u201d but also banks being too wary of lending money to small businesses. We also saw in the latest engineering construction figures that construction for the private and public sector fell once again in the June quarter: It represents a sharp fall in the level of public infrastructure work being done over the past 12 months: It all goes again to the lack of fiscal expansion in the economy, and leaving the bank to do the work to get the economy moving again. But in a broader sense, the world economic situation is mostly forcing the bank\u2019s hand. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning If other central banks cut their rates (as the US Federal Reserve recently has done), then the RBA needs to respond or our exchange rate will rise and make out exports more expensive, and that will hit our economy. Lowe also noted the unprecedented levels of economic uncertainty due to the US-China trade dispute (exaggerated by having an unpredictable loon in the White House) and Brexit: This uncertainty puts a hold on investment worldwide and generally has a stalling effect on the world economy \u2013 something that does not benefit Australia. And while Australia is suffering less from policy uncertainty than the rest of the world, our outlook is not brilliant. The spread between the Australian government 10-year and two-year bond yields is as close as it has been since the GFC \u2013 the closer the two get, the more likely it is that an economic downturn will occur: And while the governor noted that inflation expectations have improved, they still remain at rock-bottom levels: All of which adds up to a situation where, with no sign of the government willing to step up to the plate, it is left to the RBA. And so a rate cut is very much more likely than not. All our previous mention of record low interest rates will have to be rewritten as a new record is about to be set again. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

The flight, for a 299km trip each way, was claimed as part of Joyce\u2019s work as special envoy for the drought when he went to regional Victoria for a day trip to open the Wimmera Machinery Field Day. His presence at the event was controversial in the local Horsham community, with a resident starting a petition against the visit, criticising the former Nationals leader for disrespecting \u201cthe country and farmers\u201d after he was embroiled in a scandal involving an affair with a former staffer. It is also understood that some Nationals were concerned that Joyce\u2019s appearance with Webster may not help her chances of election, given Joyce\u2019s damaged reputation. According to the expenses reports, taxpayers were charged $2,600 for the flight, along with connecting flights from Armidale to Melbourne costing about $2,000. The charge is included in expenses reports published by the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority which show Joyce incurred $675,000 in expenses while engaged in the role, including his office expenses as a backbencher but excluding his salary and that of the two extra staff allocated to him in the role. As revealed by Guardian Australia on Tuesday, Joyce spent less than three weeks on the ground in drought-affected communities outside his electorate despite being engaged in the role for nine months. A spokesman for Joyce justified the charter flight to Horsham, saying the former Nationals leader was invited to open and be a guest speaker at the field day in his role as drought envoy.

As part of the trip to Victoria, Joyce also held meetings with the Australian Dairy Farmers Limited , AUSVeg and Victorian Farmers Federation. Joyce\u2019s speech to the field day focused on trade and the role of farmers exporting primary produce. He did not mention the drought. Joyce promoted the event on his Facebook page, but Webster did not share any pictures or videos of his visit on her social media. Ahead of the event, Joyce\u2019s presence was criticised in the local press by local resident Daniel Ward who started a petition that secured more than 100 signatures against Joyce\u2019s visit. The event was in the electorate of Mallee, where the former MP Andrew Broad quit after his involvement in a sexting scandal with a woman he met on a \u201csugar baby\u201d website. \u201cIf the only man we can get to open our showcase of the Wimmera is a disrespected Nationals member from northern NSW, we might as well get Andrew Broad because at least he\u2019s our local member,\u201d Ward told the Wimmerra Mail Times. Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said the revelations about the time Joyce had spent in drought-affected communities required the government to release the documents prepared by Joyce relating to his work. \u201cThe prime minister has to explain to the Australian people what he sought to achieve by appointing Barnaby Joyce into this new position of drought envoy and what return on their investment did taxpayers receive as a result of any activities Barnaby Joyce undertook,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. \u201cWhat\u2019s pretty clear is that he didn\u2019t do much and the prime minister can clear this up today by producing any correspondence between him and Barnaby Joyce.\u201d",

The top bureaucrat who oversees water in the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, Jim Bentley, told a Committee for the Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) lunch in Sydney, that planning for the expansion had now begun. He also said Sydney and other cities needed to be having a discussion about when they would reach Day Zero \u2013 the day when they would run out of water, as Cape Town almost did \u2013 in order to understand what was happening and to motivate discussions about solutions. He later clarified that he did not believe Sydney was on the verge of such a scenario. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to leave here thinking we are at a Cape Town situation, we are far from that. But we could be in that situation in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are places in NSW that are somewhat more dire and the government is working with those councils.\u201d For Sydney, the NSW government has opted for more desalination. \u201cWe have taken the decision to begin the planning for the expansion of the desalination plant. There will be other schemes for Sydney, for the Hunter and other parts of NSW,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cI will say the D word\u201d, he said. \u201cWe will be investing in dams, we will be investing in desalination, but also we must work on the adaptive side of the equation: efficiency and using the great resource that is now called waste water.\u201d The decision on more desalination plants comes as the prime minister, Scott Morrison, prepares to make a major announcement about additional funding for dams. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Funding for a list of dams in drought-affected communities was revealed by Nine News on Tuesday night, including the Mole River dam on the border of NSW and Queensland, Dungowan near Tamworth, and Wyangala in central-west NSW. Morrison will also announce $16m in funding for \u201cmanaged aquifer recharge\u201d to boost the supply of water in Dubbo, Cobar and Nyngan. This is similar to Perth, where purified wastewater is put back into the aquifer before being extracted for town supplies. The go-ahead for the expansion of the desalination plant in Sydney had been given \u201cin anticipation that water shortages will become the norm in the expanding city,\u201d Bentley said. The current desalination plant is now producing 15% of Sydney\u2019s water supply, or 250m litres a day. The plan is to double the plant, to provide 30% of Sydney\u2019s water. Sufficient intake piping is already in place for the expanded plant and the site prepared, which should allow a swift build of the additional structure to house the new plant. Bentley also flagged the need for further community discussion about using waste water as either potable water or a secondary source of water through additional pipes to new houses. Putting recycled water directly into the dam system proved a bridge too far for the Carr government when it considered options to deal with the last drought. It opted for desalination instead. However, a number of cities now recycle their sewage into the drinking water system, usually diluted in dams and rivers first, including California, Singapore and London. Perth injects it back into the aquifer before reuse. Kevin Werksman, global water markets leader at engineering consultancy Aurecon, said paleontological records showed that it was possible to have 30-year droughts, which is why recycling needed to be considered. He said treating waste water to drinking standard was one third to 50% cheaper than desalination. Bentley said reuse needed to be discussed with the community and did not necessarily mean putting it into the drinking water supply. He said recycled water could potentially be used to achieve the goal of growing a million more trees in Sydney to reduce the \u201cheat island\u201d effects of a large city. The managing director of South East Water in Victoria, Terry Benson, described how her company was collaborating on a new development, Aquarevo, which uses a community waste-water treatment plant to provide a second source of water to houses. Each house is also connected to smart technology to allow residents to monitor their water and energy use and the weather.

It was by far the hardest day of work I have ever done in my life and the pines left me with cuts on my arms and a rash that lasted 2 weeks. I drank all 6 litres of water I had in 5 hours of work. I honestly had no idea of how I will get through my 88 days of farmwork, this was going to be hell and I only had the worst expectations. June 26, 2019 marked my last day of regional farmwork in Australia towards getting my 2nd year visa. During my 88 days I was lucky to have worked on 6 different farms: \ud83c\udf4dPinerapple \ud83c\udf4a Mandarin \ud83c\udf49 Watermelon \ud83c\udf45 Tomato \ud83c\udf4b Lemon \ud83c\udf46 Zucchini I also became really close friends with people from Italy, England, France, Brazil, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and Germany. Together we turned our negative experiences of living in a jail cell (our hostel was a repurposed police station), being severely underpaid, living off bare necessities in a dirty kitchen with only one hot plate that worked for 40 people, working for a farm that was in $40+ million dollar debt, my body aching, constantly working in fear of farmers replacing you, and we turned it into an amazing experience that I will never forget. This was definitely a character building experience that brought me out of my comfort zone. Thanks to everyone one of you that I have met and who stuck though those surreal 88 days, next time I see you we&#39;ll be partying it up in a different city, or continent! #88days #88daysaslave #australia #farmwork #agriculture #nature #farm #travel #dingoblue #fruit #vegetables #oldtownroad #queensland #smoko #aussie #canada #foodporn #adventure #food #potd #drone #friends #work #pacific #holiday #experience #beautiful #photooftheday #ootd #happy</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dankusobieraj/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Da\u0144ku Sobieraj</a> (@dankusobieraj) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-06-29T02:58:43+00:00\">Jun 28, 2019 at 7:58pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Announcing the latest results of the program on Wednesday, the immigration minister, David Coleman, said that the expanded working holiday visa program was providing a vital workforce to the regions.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there are some jobs in regional Australia that aren\u2019t being filled by Australian workers, and we are giving regional businesses the immigration settings to help them fill those roles.\u201d</p> <p>The government is preparing to expand the program to allow visa holders to stay for a third year if they carry out an additional six months specified work in regional areas during their second year.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect the third year visa option will encourage even more travellers to spend more time working in regional Australia,\u201d Coleman said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/05/australia-to-relax-working-holiday-visas-to-ease-farm-jobs-shortage\">Australia to relax working holiday visas for backpackers and Pacific Islanders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government is hailing the success of a Tourism Australia campaign that targeted overseas school leavers after 43,219 second-year visas were granted in 2018-19, up by more than 7,000 compared with the previous year.</p> <p>The number of working holiday makers is expected to keep growing, with the government pursuing reciprocal visa agreements with 13 more countries, on top of the 44 already in place.</p> <p>Labor criticised the government on Wednesday for talking up the program, saying serious problems in the sector still needed to be addressed, particularly given the plans for its expansion.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is claiming victory when all they have really done is put a bandaid on,\u201d Labor\u2019s assistant shadow minister for immigration, Andrew Giles, said. \u201cWe are seeing no plan to prevent further exploitation.\u201d</p> <p>The Fair Work Ombudsman has raised concerns about worker exploitation on Australian farms, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2018-06-27/workplace-watchdog-investigation-into-labour-exploitation/9911710\">describing the conditions endured by foreign workers as \u201cbonded like slaves\u201d to labour hire contractors.</a></p> <p>A <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/content/dam/corporate/documents/business-school/research/work-and-organisational-studies/towards-a-durable-future-report.pdf\">report</a> from the University of Adelaide has also found the 88-day requirement has encouraged exploitation by attaching a critical migration outcome to work performance.</p> <p>Coleman said that the Department of Home Affairs was monitoring the program to ensure employers of working holiday makers were \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, the vast, vast majority of business do the right thing and create great opportunities for backpackers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAny criminal behaviour is, of course, treated extremely seriously and anyone who is breaking the law of Australia will be subject to very serious penalties.\u201d</p> <p>He said the government had given an extra $50m to the Fair Work Ombudsman, to assess and investigate issues in the sector and \u201ctake action where people are doing the wrong thing.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Backpackers are sharing stories of slave-like conditions while picking produce on Australian farms under a working holiday program the government is hailing a success after a 20% spike in uptake last year. Under the hashtag #88daysaslave on Instagram, backpackers are sharing images and stories of exploitation, including being paid as little as $4 an hour and working in unsafe and gruelling conditions. While many of the posts are lighthearted, the more than 5,000 posts by visa holders also highlight rampant problems of exploitation in the agricultural sector that has seen reports of sexual abuse and underpayment of workers desperate to avoid deportation. The 88 days refers to the time that first-year working holiday visa holders must work in regional areas to be eligible for a second-year visa. One backpacker marked the end of her stint with a post on Instagram stating: \u201cFarm life is finally over 88/88 days finished to get my second year visa from picking peas for $4 an hour to packing oranges in a shed with great people.\u201d Another man posted: \u201cIt took me 5.5 months to get my 88 days but now it\u2019s done and my 2nd year visa is granted! \u2026 In these 5 months I\u2019ve picked pumpkins, vaccinated thousands of chickens, struggled to find enough work while smoking heaps of weed and drinking way too much goon to be working 75 hour weeks on a construction site building chicken sheds\u201d. Announcing the latest results of the program on Wednesday, the immigration minister, David Coleman, said that the expanded working holiday visa program was providing a vital workforce to the regions. \u201cWe know there are some jobs in regional Australia that aren\u2019t being filled by Australian workers, and we are giving regional businesses the immigration settings to help them fill those roles.\u201d The government is preparing to expand the program to allow visa holders to stay for a third year if they carry out an additional six months specified work in regional areas during their second year. \u201cWe expect the third year visa option will encourage even more travellers to spend more time working in regional Australia,\u201d Coleman said. The government is hailing the success of a Tourism Australia campaign that targeted overseas school leavers after 43,219 second-year visas were granted in 2018-19, up by more than 7,000 compared with the previous year. The number of working holiday makers is expected to keep growing, with the government pursuing reciprocal visa agreements with 13 more countries, on top of the 44 already in place. Labor criticised the government on Wednesday for talking up the program, saying serious problems in the sector still needed to be addressed, particularly given the plans for its expansion. \u201cThe government is claiming victory when all they have really done is put a bandaid on,\u201d Labor\u2019s assistant shadow minister for immigration, Andrew Giles, said. \u201cWe are seeing no plan to prevent further exploitation.\u201d The Fair Work Ombudsman has raised concerns about worker exploitation on Australian farms, describing the conditions endured by foreign workers as \u201cbonded like slaves\u201d to labour hire contractors. A report from the University of Adelaide has also found the 88-day requirement has encouraged exploitation by attaching a critical migration outcome to work performance. Coleman said that the Department of Home Affairs was monitoring the program to ensure employers of working holiday makers were \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d. \u201cOf course, the vast, vast majority of business do the right thing and create great opportunities for backpackers,\u201d he said. \u201cAny criminal behaviour is, of course, treated extremely seriously and anyone who is breaking the law of Australia will be subject to very serious penalties.\u201d He said the government had given an extra $50m to the Fair Work Ombudsman, to assess and investigate issues in the sector and \u201ctake action where people are doing the wrong thing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Police and health and safety experts are investigating after a worker died in an incident involving machinery at the Tata steelworks in Port Talbot. Emergency services including a hazardous area response team were called to the site in south Wales shortly before 2pm on Wednesday. Police initially described it as an \u201cisolated incident\u201d with no threat to the public. Officers later confirmed the man had been fatally injured. \u201cWe can confirm that one person has died and his next of kin have been informed. We are now liaising with the Health and Safety Executive [HSE],\u201d said a South Wales police spokeswoman. Stephen Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon, the constituency in which the steelworks is located, said: \u201cTerrible, tragic news coming out of Port Talbot steelworks today. My heart and thoughts go out to the family and friends of the young man who has had his life so tragically cut short. I have just spoken with Tata, who will of course be launching an investigation.\u201d David Rees, the Welsh assembly member for Aberavon, said: \u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with his family and colleagues at this sad time. We must now await police &amp; HSE investigation on this incident.\u201d A spokesperson for the Welsh ambulance service said: \u201cWe were called at approximately 1.58pm to reports of a person needing urgent medical attention after an accident with a machine at Tata steelworks, Port Talbot. \u201cWe responded with two ambulance officers, one emergency ambulance, two vehicles of our hazardous area response team and our crews were supported by the Wales air ambulance.\u201d Tata Steel confirmed the incident in a tweet and said a full investigation had been launched. In April, two workers were injured at the plant after several fires broke out when molten metal came into contact with cold water on a railway track. The explosion and fire at the Tata Steel site lit up Port Talbot and could be heard up to 15 miles (24km) away. In 2001, three men were killed and 12 injured in a blast at the plant, then owned by Corus. The steelworkers\u2019 union Community described the death as \u201cabsolutely tragic news\u201d and said its thoughts were with the family of the worker. \u201cWe will be pressing Tata Steel to carry out a full investigation and ensuring that all lessons are learnt, and procedures and processes are reviewed, and necessary changes are implemented to ensure all workers at the Port Talbot plant are safe at work,\u201d said the union\u2019s general secretary, Roy Rickhuss.",

Iran has turned back to expanding its nuclear enrichment programme after Trump\u2019s decision last year to pull out of the accord and re-impose sanctions on Tehran, targeting its ability to export oil.</p> <p>In an eagerly awaited address, Rouhani said: \u201cFor one and a half years, the US government has sought to deprive Iran of its right to access the world economy by threats and extra-territorial sanctions \u2026 Halt the sanctions and return to your commitments so the dialogue may reopen.\u201d</p> <p>Iran has \u201cresisted the most merciless economic terrorism\u201d from a nation that is engaging in \u201cinternational piracy\u201d, Rouhani said. \u201cMemento photos are the final stage of negotiations, not the first one.\u201d</p> <p>He challenged the sincerity of America\u2019s offer of negotiations, pointing to Trump administration officials\u2019 boasts of the damage inflicted by sanctions on Iran. \u201cWe cannot believe the invitation to negotiations by people who claim to have applied the harshest sanctions in history against the dignity and prosperity of our nation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His remarks left the US and Iran as far apart as ever despite parallel mediation efforts from France, the UK, Pakistan and Japan.</p> <p>The impasse leaves the west and its Gulf allies faced with a dilemma over how to respond to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/saudi-arabia-oil-attack-boris-johnson-says-uk-believes-iran-responsible\">attack on oil facilities</a> in Saudi Arabia earlier this month. The EU has attributed responsibility to Iran, but a detailed report has not yet been compiled. Iran for its part is likely to take further steps away from the nuclear deal, and may escalate attacks on Gulf shipping.</p> <p>Iran has denied any involvement and says any strikes by the US or Saudi Arabia will lead to \u201call-out war\u201d. Emphasising the precarious regional situation, Rouhani said on Wednesday: \u201cOur region is on the edge of collapse, as a single blunder can fuel a big fire.\u201d</p> <p>Some key Gulf states such as the United Arab Emirates are wary of military action.

      "bodyText": "Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, has ruled out negotiations on its nuclear programme with the United States so long as sanctions remained in place and said he was not interested in a \u201cmemento photo\u201d with Donald Trump. \u201cI would like to announce that our response to any negotiation under sanctions is negative,\u201d Rouhani said in an address to the UN general assembly in New York. His remarks represent the final nail in the coffin of efforts to negotiate a high-profile summit between Rouhani and the US president at the UN. European states will now face fresh pressure from the US to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which is unravelling under pressure from the Trump administration. Iran has turned back to expanding its nuclear enrichment programme after Trump\u2019s decision last year to pull out of the accord and re-impose sanctions on Tehran, targeting its ability to export oil. In an eagerly awaited address, Rouhani said: \u201cFor one and a half years, the US government has sought to deprive Iran of its right to access the world economy by threats and extra-territorial sanctions \u2026 Halt the sanctions and return to your commitments so the dialogue may reopen.\u201d Iran has \u201cresisted the most merciless economic terrorism\u201d from a nation that is engaging in \u201cinternational piracy\u201d, Rouhani said. \u201cMemento photos are the final stage of negotiations, not the first one.\u201d He challenged the sincerity of America\u2019s offer of negotiations, pointing to Trump administration officials\u2019 boasts of the damage inflicted by sanctions on Iran. \u201cWe cannot believe the invitation to negotiations by people who claim to have applied the harshest sanctions in history against the dignity and prosperity of our nation,\u201d he said. His remarks left the US and Iran as far apart as ever despite parallel mediation efforts from France, the UK, Pakistan and Japan. The impasse leaves the west and its Gulf allies faced with a dilemma over how to respond to the attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia earlier this month. The EU has attributed responsibility to Iran, but a detailed report has not yet been compiled. Iran for its part is likely to take further steps away from the nuclear deal, and may escalate attacks on Gulf shipping. Iran has denied any involvement and says any strikes by the US or Saudi Arabia will lead to \u201call-out war\u201d. Emphasising the precarious regional situation, Rouhani said on Wednesday: \u201cOur region is on the edge of collapse, as a single blunder can fuel a big fire.\u201d Some key Gulf states such as the United Arab Emirates are wary of military action. UAE officials said privately that diplomacy is the focus. The Gulf states believe the Saudi attack has shaken EU support for the existing nuclear deal, and scope now exists to bring the US and Europe together in pursuit of a reworked wider deal that covers Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and constraints on Iran\u2019s regional behaviour. Germany, France and the UK remain committed to the nuclear deal but it was becoming \u201cincreasingly difficult\u201d, the EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, said earlier on Wednesday. Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson expended intense energy on the sidelines of the UN general assembly trying to persuade Iran to make a move that would allow Trump to drop sanctions. Iran claimed it was offering to break the deadlock by moving more quickly to to an era of permanent more intrusive inspections of its potential nuclear sites. But it said it would act only so long as the US agreed to lift its sanctions and the US Congress turned the deal into a permanent treaty. The proposal, as briefed, did not extend beyond what was proposed previously by the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, in July and rejected by the US as insufficient. But Rouhani offered a glimmer of hope in his speech, saying: \u201cStop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations...The JCPOA was a minimum for you and for us, however if you wish more, or require more, you should also give and pay more.\u201d The US emphasised the negative diplomatic trend by announcing further sanctions against Iran, including by targeting Chinese entities that purchasing oil from Tehran. Speaking to an Iranian dissident group in New York, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said: \u201cWe\u2019re telling China, and all nations \u2013 know that we will sanction every violation of sanctions of all activity.\u201d He said that sanctions were being placed both on companies and on their chief executives. On the first two days of the general assembly, Macron had sought to persuade the US and Iran to move simultaneously so the Iranians give wider explicit assurance to adjust the nuclear deal, including coming back into compliance with its existing terms, at the same time as Trump lifted sanctions. In broadcast interviews at the UN Rouhani had admitted that the lack of trust between the US and Iran was making it difficult for either side to move. At a late-night meeting on Tuesday Johnson urged Rouhani metaphorically to stand by the swimming pool with Trump and to jump together. The foreign secretary, Douglas Raab, told MPs that the UK was not abandoning support for the current nuclear deal, but said \u201cwe can improve on it\u201d. \u201cUltimately, we need a longer-term framework that provides greater certainty over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.

      "body": "<p>More than a century ago, the German pathologist Alois Alzheimer observed that people who died with dementia had deposits of an insoluble material in their brains, later known as amyloid plaques. Amyloid turned out to be made of protein, but in a form unlike the thousands of proteins our cells turn out every minute of our lives to carry out all our essential functions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/news/tributes-professor-sir-christopher-dobson\" title=\"\">Chris Dobson</a>, who has died aged 69 of pancreatic cancer, devoted his life to explaining the chemical processes that disrupt the production of healthy proteins and instead trigger their aggregation into toxic clumps. He focused on the mechanisms that direct long protein chains to fold up into the three-dimensional shapes that allow them to engage in essential biochemical interactions, and exhaustively researched the question of how they \u201cmisfold\u201d when these mechanisms fail, instead adopting forms that stick tightly to one another as toxic amyloid fibrils.</p> <p>Dobson pursued the question out of scientific interest, but came to realise that his discoveries were of enormous potential benefit to patients: the range of misfolding diseases now includes diabetes and Parkinson\u2019s disease as well as Alzheimer\u2019s, and many others that are less well known. He was knighted in 2018 for his work, among a host of international awards.</p> <p>A key discovery came about by chance. In the early 1990s one of Dobson\u2019s graduate students left a solution of the protein lysozyme (derived from egg white) inside a laboratory instrument over the weekend, and found on his return that it had set like a jelly. On closer inspection it proved to contain amyloid fibrils, structures that until that moment Dobson had known only from descriptions of disease.</p> <p>Using the latest advances in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, techniques that had only recently begun to be applied to molecules as large as proteins, Dobson and his colleagues systematically set about understanding the dynamics of protein folding and misfolding, applying insights from chemistry to this biological problem.</p> <p>He went on to provide a strong theoretical underpinning by writing a mathematical description of the way fibrils form, and of how they can set off a chain reaction by \u201cseeding\u201d the production of new fibrils, as happens in prion diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy.</p> <p>More recently he turned to drug discovery, screening a variety of agents for their ability to prevent fibrils forming. Encouraging laboratory results suggest this approach could transform the prevention and treatment of the diseases of ageing, which emerge as the body\u2019s natural repair mechanisms begin to fail.</p> <p>Born in Rinteln, in Lower Saxony, Germany, Dobson had his roots in Yorkshire. His parents, Arthur and Mabel (nee Pollard), grew up in Bradford, and both left school without qualifications. Arthur worked in the wool exchange before joining the army on the outbreak of war. He rose through the ranks and had been commissioned as an officer by the time Chris was born, the third of three children after his siblings, Graham and Gillian. The family followed their father from one posting to another, including a spell in Nigeria. Dobson\u2019s education became more stable when he went to the Cathedral preparatory school for boys in Hereford and then to Abingdon school in Oxfordshire, where he enjoyed excellent science teaching.</p> <p>He entered Keble College, Oxford, to read chemistry in 1967, graduated with a first, and then moved to Merton College, Oxford, for a doctorate.

      "bodyText": "More than a century ago, the German pathologist Alois Alzheimer observed that people who died with dementia had deposits of an insoluble material in their brains, later known as amyloid plaques. Amyloid turned out to be made of protein, but in a form unlike the thousands of proteins our cells turn out every minute of our lives to carry out all our essential functions. Chris Dobson, who has died aged 69 of pancreatic cancer, devoted his life to explaining the chemical processes that disrupt the production of healthy proteins and instead trigger their aggregation into toxic clumps. He focused on the mechanisms that direct long protein chains to fold up into the three-dimensional shapes that allow them to engage in essential biochemical interactions, and exhaustively researched the question of how they \u201cmisfold\u201d when these mechanisms fail, instead adopting forms that stick tightly to one another as toxic amyloid fibrils. Dobson pursued the question out of scientific interest, but came to realise that his discoveries were of enormous potential benefit to patients: the range of misfolding diseases now includes diabetes and Parkinson\u2019s disease as well as Alzheimer\u2019s, and many others that are less well known. He was knighted in 2018 for his work, among a host of international awards. A key discovery came about by chance. In the early 1990s one of Dobson\u2019s graduate students left a solution of the protein lysozyme (derived from egg white) inside a laboratory instrument over the weekend, and found on his return that it had set like a jelly. On closer inspection it proved to contain amyloid fibrils, structures that until that moment Dobson had known only from descriptions of disease. Using the latest advances in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, techniques that had only recently begun to be applied to molecules as large as proteins, Dobson and his colleagues systematically set about understanding the dynamics of protein folding and misfolding, applying insights from chemistry to this biological problem. He went on to provide a strong theoretical underpinning by writing a mathematical description of the way fibrils form, and of how they can set off a chain reaction by \u201cseeding\u201d the production of new fibrils, as happens in prion diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy. More recently he turned to drug discovery, screening a variety of agents for their ability to prevent fibrils forming. Encouraging laboratory results suggest this approach could transform the prevention and treatment of the diseases of ageing, which emerge as the body\u2019s natural repair mechanisms begin to fail. Born in Rinteln, in Lower Saxony, Germany, Dobson had his roots in Yorkshire. His parents, Arthur and Mabel (nee Pollard), grew up in Bradford, and both left school without qualifications. Arthur worked in the wool exchange before joining the army on the outbreak of war. He rose through the ranks and had been commissioned as an officer by the time Chris was born, the third of three children after his siblings, Graham and Gillian. The family followed their father from one posting to another, including a spell in Nigeria. Dobson\u2019s education became more stable when he went to the Cathedral preparatory school for boys in Hereford and then to Abingdon school in Oxfordshire, where he enjoyed excellent science teaching. He entered Keble College, Oxford, to read chemistry in 1967, graduated with a first, and then moved to Merton College, Oxford, for a doctorate. As a graduate student with the physical chemist Iain Campbell, he was one of the first to demonstrate dynamic change in the structure of a protein molecule (lysozyme) using nuclear magnetic resonance. After a spell at Harvard University he returned to Oxford as a lecturer in chemistry and fellow of Lady Margaret Hall in 1980, and subsequently became founding director of the Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences. Dobson moved to Cambridge University in 2001 as John Humphrey Plummer professor of chemical and structural biology. Thereafter his research group began to apply their new understanding of protein folding more directly to diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, and in 2012 he founded the Cambridge Centre for Misfolding Diseases. In 2016 he completed the journey from basic science to medical application when he co-founded Wren Therapeutics, a company specialising in drug discovery and development for such diseases. He always insisted his discoveries owed everything to the bright young people he attracted to work with him, and paid particular attention to promoting the careers of women in his lab \u2013 for example he appointed Carol Robinson, now president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, to a post-doctoral position at Oxford after she had taken an eight-year career break to raise her family. In 2007 Dobson accepted the post of master of St John\u2019s College, Cambridge. He threw himself into the life of the college and was reputed to know the name of every student and staff member. He took particular interest in making St John\u2019s more accessible to students from non-traditional backgrounds, introducing a grant scheme for those from low-income families and initiatives for students with disabilities. In 1977 he married Mary Schove, a historian of medicine. She survives him, as do their sons, Richard and William. \u2022 Christopher Martin Dobson, chemist, born 8 October 1949; died 8 September 2019",

Rebay-Salisbury, who is leading a major project on motherhood in prehistory, said that there is a growing realisation that studying how children lived in the past could provide crucial insights into ancient societies. \u201cFor a long time, people were just interested in swords and men,\u201d she said. \u201cGradually we\u2019re discovering that there were other people as well who deserve our attention, including children and mothers.\u201d The team is planning to analyse other, similar artefacts. \u201cSimilar vessels, although rare, do appear in other prehistoric cultures, such as Rome and ancient Greece, across the world,\u201d said Dunne. \u201cIdeally, we\u2019d like to carry out a larger geographic study and investigate whether they served the same purpose.\u201d The analysis is published in the journal Nature.",

We all saw it this year, with the frustrated discussion about a possible World Nations League, and the opposition of several members of the Six Nations to change the status quo. Rugby is also a very logical sport. It is almost impossible for a tier one country to lose to a tier two nation. Or that a country at the top end of tier two, such as Fiji, lose to one at the bottom end, such as Uruguay. Fiji\u2019s pack weighed 891kg, Uruguay\u2019s 817. Impossible to compete, right?

Any interpretation will be yours, but there\u2019s a fairytale logic to it, and the action is anchored by Seale Jones\u2019s remarkably assured image-making and a performance of intense hollow-eyed persistence by Kosky. Self-evidently a first feature \u2013 running to just 75 minutes \u2013 it nevertheless serves as a striking and effective calling card. How encouraging it is to see an emergent British film-maker reaching for the uncanny and mysterious, rather than settling for hackneyed or humdrum. \u2022 To Tokyo is released in the UK on 27 September.",

      "bodyText": "Weaker growth in both advanced and developing countries means the possibility of a global recession in 2020 is a clear and present danger, the UN has warned. In a flagship report, the UN\u2019s trade and development body, Unctad, said 2019 will endure the weakest expansion in a decade and there was a risk of the slowdown turning into outright contraction next year. The UN said warning lights were flashing around trade wars, currency gyrations, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and movements in long-term interest rates but there was little sign that policymakers were prepared for the coming storm. The annual trade and development report said finance ministries and central banks should end their \u201cobsession with stock prices, quarterly earnings and investor confidence\u201d and instead focus on job creation, boosting wages and increasing public investment. The Unctad report said: \u201cA spluttering north, a general slowdown in the south and rising levels of debt everywhere are hanging over the global economy: these combined with increased market volatility, a fractured multilateral system and mounting uncertainty, are framing the immediate policy challenge.\u201d It said the global economy remained fragile even though the financial crisis ended a decade ago, and called for a fundamental rethink of a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d model that had saddled the developing world with record levels of debt. The report also said: \u201cThe macro-economic policy stance adopted to date has been lopsided and insufficiently co-ordinated to give a sustained boost to aggregate demand, with adjustments left to the vagaries of the market through a mixture of cost-cutting and liberalisation measures. Ephemeral growth spurts and financial volatility have been the predictable results.\u201d Global growth will fall from 3% in 2018 to 2.3% this year \u2013 its weakest since the 1.7% contraction in 2009, according to the report. Several big emerging countries were already in recession and some advanced economies, including Germany and the UK, were dangerously close to one. Central banks , including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have recently announced interest cuts in an attempt to stimulate activity but the UN report was pessimistic about the chances of success. \u201cThe slowdown in growth in all the major developed economies, including the US, confirms that relying on easy monetary policy and asset price rises to stimulate demand produces, at best, ephemeral growth, while tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals fail to trigger productive investment.\u201d Unconventional monetary measures \u2013 such as negative interest rates and creating money through quantitative easing \u2013 remained the go-to policies for addressing weaknesses in the global economy even though they have had a weak record since the financial crisis. Trade growth was expected to slow sharply this year as a result of a slump in global demand and the protectionist measures announced by Donald Trump. The UN stressed the need to look beyond the short-term threat of recession to deeper and long-running threats. \u201cBeyond the immediate risks that could stall the global economy are a series of macrostructural challenges that predate the global financial crisis and have gone largely unattended since then,\u201d the report said. It added that four issues stood out due to their high degree of interdependence: the smaller share of the economy\u2019s proceeds going to labour; the erosion of public spending; the weakening of investment; and the unsustainable increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It continued: \u201cClimate protection requires a massive new wave of investment, reinventing energy and other carbon-emitting sectors. New low-carbon technologies must be created, installed and maintained on a global scale.\u201d The report also highlighted increased green investment, which it said would be a significant source of income and jobs. \u201cRecent discussions call this strategy the Green New Deal, recalling the 1930s New Deal, which tackled unemployment and low wages, the predatory nature of finance, infrastructure gaps and regional inequalities, in the context of recovering from the Great Depression.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The maker of the revived Routemaster bus and one of Northern Ireland\u2019s biggest employers has collapsed into administration \u2013 leading immediately to 1,200 redundancies. The failure of Wrightbus, which comes after a breakdown in 11th-hour rescue talks, represents the UK\u2019s second significant insolvency of the week, following the demise of the holiday group Thomas Cook. The Ballymena-based engineering company had been scrambling to find a buyer. An expected sale evaporated at the end of last week when the Chinese engineering group Weichai and a firm led by the JCB heir, Jo Bamford, pulled out of talks. That double blow came days after the Northern Irish businessman Darren Donnelly also withdrew from making a potential bid for the firm. The accounting group Deloitte, which had been running the sales auction for the company, has now been appointed administrator for a collection of the businesses within the group, including Wrights Group, Wrightbus, Wright En-Drive, Wright Composites and Metallix. The firm\u2019s collapse came after Boris Johnson told parliament his government would do everything it could to help Wrightbus. Ian Paisley, the MP for North Antrim, also told the Guardian last week he believed the government had already demonstrated it could help the stricken manufacturer without breaching state aid rules by directing state-controlled companies to place orders with Wrightbus.

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel\u2019s government has promised more than half a billion euros to revitalise the country\u2019s crisis-hit forests in the fight against climate change. A third of Germany\u2019s landmass is covered in woodland, and forests play an important role in the country\u2019s national folklore, from the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm to the poems of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. But a combination of storms, drought, forest fires and aggressively spreading bark beetle plagues have so far this year destroyed swathes of German forest equivalent to more than 250,000 football fields, forcing the government to convene an emergency \u201cforest summit\u201d, held on Wednesday in Berlin. \u201cEvery missing tree is a missing comrade-in-arms against climate change,\u201d agriculture minister Julia Kl\u00f6ckner said ahead of the gathering of around 170 organisations representing both environmental groups and industry. \u201cWhatever we don\u2019t reforest today, our grandchildren will, of course, miss.\u201d In the face of the numerous challenges, Germany\u2019s federal government has announced making available \u20ac547mover the next four years to remove dead trees and plant new ones, with state contributions boosting the emergency fund to \u20ac800m. The defence minister and CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has pledged the military\u2019s help with the effort. Woodland owners however insist their trees deserve better financial compensation for cleaning polluted air. Representatives of the country\u2019s influential forestry industry \u2013 employing some 720,000 people, almost as many as the car sector \u2013 have already warned the funds won\u2019t be enough to replace the forest that has been lost. Umbrella organisation AGDW, representing forest owners and forestry workers, has called for direct investments of \u20ac2.3bn, as well as a new tax on industrial pollution that would help to subsidise forests at \u20ac125 a year per hectare of forest. Trees absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), and their leaves can trap the toxic pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082), ozone, and harmful microscopic particles produced by diesel vehicles, cooking and wood burning. According to AGDW, Germany\u2019s forest currently compensates 14% of the country\u2019s CO\u2082 emissions. \u201cThose who pollute our environment with dirt have to pay for it, and those who receive the dirt should be financially compensated in turn\u201d, forest owner Ferdinand Graf von Westerholt told broadcaster ZDF. \u201cThat\u2019s the solution.\u201d But even how the funds already made available can be used has become a divisive issue between landowner and environmentalists. The forestry industry proposes replanting areas of destroyed forest with some non-native species that are more suited to a drier and hotter climate, such as the Japanese larch, the North American Douglas fir or the northern red oak. Environmental groups warn this could have a devastating impact on local wildlife, which could struggle to adapt to the new environment. Hubert Weiger, chair of the German branch of Friends of the Earth said cash should be injected on \u201cpublic money for public services\u201d principle: \u201cTaxpayers\u2019 money should only be spent to build up natural broad-leaved deciduous forests made up of native species\u201d.",

EDF Energy said the construction cost for Hinkley Point C in Somerset had climbed by between \u00a31.9bn to \u00a32.9bn from the company\u2019s last estimates and is running the risk of further delays. As a consequence, the total cost has risen from \u00a319.5bn to between \u00a321.5bn and \u00a322.5bn. The nuclear developer blamed challenging ground conditions, which made earthworks at the site more expensive than it expected. The French company also misjudged the cost of adapting its new pressurised water reactor design to meet UK nuclear regulation standards. EDF is using the same reactor design at the Olkiluoto nuclear project in Finland and at Flamanville in France, where costs have also spiralled by billions of euros. EDF Energy\u2019s strategy director, Paul Spence, told BBC Radio 4 that he \u201ccan\u2019t be sure today\u201d that there won\u2019t be further cost increases at Hinkley Point, which is due to start supplying 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity by 2025. He said: \u201cThe important point for me to make is that those costs are not costs that hit the consumer, they are costs that come to us as shareholders in the project.\u201d In a letter to staff, EDF Energy\u2019s chief executive, Simone Rossi, said Hinkley\u2019s cost overruns will \u201cnot add a penny\u201d to energy bills or raise costs for the taxpayer. The project has a government contract that guarantees a set price of \u00a392.50 for every megawatt hour of electricity produced and was \u201cdesigned with the risks of a first-of-a-kind project in mind\u201d, he said. The set price is high enough for EDF Energy to remain in line for healthy shareholder returns from the Hinkley Point project despite its rising costs. The Guardian understands that the latest cost increase brings EDF Energy\u2019s internal rate of return down to between 7.6% and 7.8%. The project originally offered a 9% return on investment, which slipped to 8.5% after its 2017 cost review. However, the rising costs have raised questions over plans to fund a follow-up nuclear project at Sizewell C using a different financing model to Hinkley, which would put taxpayers on the hook for rising costs. Ministers hope t a regulated asset base, or Rab, model will make the projects cheaper by shifting the risk of rising costs from the developer to billpayers. The model helps cut the upfront costs of large infrastructure projects by allowing developers to start claiming their investment back from consumers at an agreed rate before the project is complete. The model has been used to fund the Thames Tideway project, which will be completed by 2023 but has already raised water bills by \u00a320-25 a year. The model has found favour in the City for offering investors the promise of steady, long-term returns. Infrastructure investors, in particular, are understood to be eager for an alternative to the regulated energy and water sectors. Both of which are under pressure to cut profits or risk a run-in with regulators or renationalisation under a Labour government. Critics of the plan said using a Rab model for a nuclear project could mean higher risks for billpayers if there are delays. Jonathan Marshall, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said the \u201capparent inability\u201d of the nuclear industry to deliver projects on time and on budget will be a \u201ccause for concern\u201d if the Rab model is adopted. \u201cNew delays and cost overruns highlight why there are concerns around transferring more construction risk of new nuclear power stations ,\u201d Marshall added. Hinkley\u2019s latest cost overrun has also reignited debate over whether the government should pursue an expensive nuclear renaissance while the cost of renewable energy becomes cheaper. The cost of supporting new offshore windfarms from the mid-2020s fell to record lows of about \u00a340 per megawatt hour of electricity last week in an auction for government contracts, less than half the cost of Hinkley Point C. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThe new Hinkley nuclear plant looked like a bad idea when it was first proposed, and it\u2019s got worse ever since. New offshore wind now costs less than half as much as Hinkley, and it might get even cheaper by the time the much-delayed reactors crank into action.\u201d He said it has become overwhelmingly clear that an energy system run on renewables would be the cheapest, fastest and most reliable way to cut carbon emissions.",

For a while, it seemed as if everyone she had ever known was going to email. \u201cHi! We were in bio-chem class together, how are you doing?!\u201d she\u2019d read. Or: \u201cHey, I always knew you\u2019d write a book!\u201d She smiles at the bleak comedy of a situation which no one, least of all Miller herself, knows quite how to handle. At some point in the emails, every sender would jettison the pleasantries and make the awkward turn towards saying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Around midnight on 17 January 2015, Miller was spotted by two students at Stanford University being sexually assaulted by a third student as she lay unconscious on the ground behind some bins. She was 22, a recent graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, working in her first job at a tech firm and living with her parents in Palo Alto. Earlier that evening she had, on a whim, agreed to accompany her younger sister to a fraternity party at Stanford University, a 10-minute drive from the house. By the early hours of the morning, Miller was in a hospital having her vagina and anus swabbed by police doctors \u2013 and 19-year-old Brock Turner was in custody.</p> <p>What happened next has become a textbook example of the double standards applied to sexual assault victims and their assailants. While Turner was characterised as a champion swimmer, conscientious student and upstanding young man surely incapable of assault, Miller became the \u201cdrunk girl at the party\u201d.</p> <p>In that moment, her life split in two. To the majority of her friends and family, she was still Chanel \u2013 an anglicised version of her Chinese name, Zhang Xiao Xia \u2013 albeit a more muted version of the woman they knew. Within the legal system, and in a small, dark chamber of her own mind, she was \u201cEmily Doe\u201d, the pseudonym of the \u201cBrock Turner sexual assault victim\u201d, a woman reduced to the sum total of what someone else had done to her. After Turner was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault and sentenced to just six months in prison \u2013 of which he ultimately served three \u2013 Miller read out a victim impact statement in court. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d she said, addressing Turner directly, \u201cbut you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d Over 12 subsequent pages, Miller delineated, with devastating precision, the experience of being sexually assaulted by a man for whom the legal system had more sympathy than his victim. In June 2016, when the statement was published by <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/heres-the-powerful-letter-the-stanford-victim-read-to-her-ra\" title=\"\">BuzzFeed</a>, more than 18 million people read it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5eab9aab66ea819d8832d7d6724f73f10a397d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5eab9aab66ea819d8832d7d6724f73f10a397d/0_60_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanford University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman carries a sign in solidarity for Miller during graduation at Stanford University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabrielle Lurie/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three years later, Miller is sitting opposite me in a conference room at a publishing house in New York, her memoir, Know My Name, on the table before us. Miller is slight and softly spoken, with long hair and a mildly sardonic air, the kind of details that the victim in a sexual assault is used to having raised. Since the trial, every decision Miller makes \u2013 what to wear, how to comport herself, the extent to which she should smile or not smile, where she should go and what route she should take to get there \u2013 has, for a split-second, been refracted through what she calls \u201cthe lens of court\u201d, a reflex audit of how her most trivial choices might be levelled against her by lawyers. \u201cI know how to dismiss and turn down the volume on those voices, that question and reprimand,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s all there and it is really inhibiting.\u201d</p> <p>Know My Name is written in vivid, punishing detail. The fraternity house has \u201ca sour, yeasty atmosphere, where you could hear the soles of your shoes unpeeling from sticky floors\u201d. After the assault, Miller\u2019s body is \u201ca nerveless mannequin\u201d. She is bitterly funny about the dehumanising absurdity of the rape processing suite, where, after being swabbed and photographed (\u201cI wondered if I was suppose to smile with teeth, where I should be looking\u201d) she is given some sweatpants and a pamphlet, which together seem to say: \u201cWelcome to the club, here\u2019s your new uniform. In your folder you\u2019ll find guidelines that will lay out the steps of trauma and recovery which may take your entire lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>The amazing thing, says Miller, is that at the time, the circumstances of her assault seemed so open and shut that in her innocence she imagined there was no case to be answered. \u201cIf someone is found humping an unmoving body, what is the case?\u201d she says now. The case was one of consent; Turner pleaded innocent and claimed not only to have asked Miller \u201cif she wanted me to finger her\u201d, but to have asked if she liked it and heard her confirm: \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You get to choose how the experience serves you; what you draw from it. I use my anger as fuel, my grief as strength</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More broadly, however, the case turned less on the specifics of Miller\u2019s conduct that night and more on her credibility as a victim. Miller\u2019s sexual history, relationship status and the question of whether or not she \u201cdid a lot of partying in college\u201d were all considered permissible points of access for Turner\u2019s defence, as was the fact that, prior to blacking out and waking up in the hospital, she had peed outside. A man who drunkenly takes a leak under a tree is unremarkable; a woman who does so is lewd.</p> <p>There were other biases at work, among them the broad assumption that alcohol excuses sexual assault, particularly on campus. Oddly, this presumption is nowhere more starkly on display than in journalist Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s new book, Talking to Strangers \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/307/307823/talking-to-strangers/9780241351567.html\" title=\"\">publicity</a> for which promises to examine a \u201cseries of encounters and misunderstandings\u201d between people and in which he quotes extensively from Miller\u2019s case.</p> <p>Set aside, for a moment, the ethics of a man using the raw transcript of a woman\u2019s sexual assault trial to prop up his theory about communication, and focus on Gladwell\u2019s assertion that: \u201cPeople v. Brock Turner is a case about alcohol.\u201d The entire case, Gladwell writes, \u201cturned on the degree of Emily Doe\u2019s drunkenness\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49e37ae2a6c3e580700f91c8d330293189406524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49e37ae2a6c3e580700f91c8d330293189406524/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brock Turner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brock Turner leaves the Santa Clara County Jail in San Jose.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From a narrow legal point of view, Gladwell is correct. But in answer to the question: \u201cHow did an apparently harmless encounter on a dancefloor end in a crime?\u201d Gladwell describes the assault as a \u201ctransparency failure on steroids\u201d, and offers the apparently blithe summary: \u201cA young woman and a young man meet at a party, then proceed to tragically misunderstand each other\u2019s intentions \u2013 and they\u2019re drunk.\u201d Little credence is given to the possibility raised at the trial that Turner, far from \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d the signals from Miller, could have understood them perfectly, nor that the pivotal disinhibiting agent in this case may not have been alcohol but misogyny. An unconscious woman cannot object when a man inserts his fingers and foreign objects into her vagina; what Emily Doe did or didn\u2019t want was irrelevant.</p> <p>At mention of Gladwell, Miller smiles and zips her mouth. Who needs it? But a moment later, she says: \u201cWe say alcohol is the cause, but to me it\u2019s such a small way of thinking. Alcohol could never be the root of something that is part of such a greater pattern: when you look at the thousands of cases [of violence against women], the common thread is not that we are drinking too much. The fact that we continue to minimise and rationalise violence is so insanely damaging. This is not an intellectual conversation; it\u2019s not a time for posturing. And it\u2019s not OK that, in Gladwell\u2019s book, I was treated and regarded as a case, as something locked in, and not as a person who is actively functioning and speaking and writing and prepared to provide my opinion.\u201d</p> <p>She says: \u201cYou have trolls, then you have this very sophisticated way [of writing]; it\u2019s the same amount of damage, but disguised as this reasonable [critique]. It\u2019s so easy for someone to copy and paste these sections from the transcript, to take my statement and analyse it however they may please, but it\u2019s so difficult to live it. I\u2019m not interested in making excuses any more. When a drunk man beats a woman, we don\u2019t say: well the alcohol affected his decision-making. You\u2019re accountable for that behaviour. It\u2019s a crime.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s infuriating how much victims have to sacrifice, how we have to speak in\u00a0gruesome detail about private things</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the past 18 months, Miller has been emboldened to speak out and ultimately shed her anonymity by the examples of the women testifying against Harvey Weinstein, and by Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony against Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cI watched them literally sacrifice themselves for the greater good, with the single hope that it\u2019s going to help someone. It\u2019s infuriating when we see how much victims have to sacrifice and give away from themselves, and how much we have to speak in gruesome detail about things that feel very private, in order to make this apparent to people. How many times we\u2019re caught in that cycle of saying: \u2018Doesn\u2019t this mean something to you? Why can\u2019t you see me? Why doesn\u2019t this hurt you?

      "bodyText": "It has been just over three weeks since Chanel Miller allowed her name to become public and the 27-year-old is still trying to adjust. For a while, it seemed as if everyone she had ever known was going to email. \u201cHi! We were in bio-chem class together, how are you doing?!\u201d she\u2019d read. Or: \u201cHey, I always knew you\u2019d write a book!\u201d She smiles at the bleak comedy of a situation which no one, least of all Miller herself, knows quite how to handle. At some point in the emails, every sender would jettison the pleasantries and make the awkward turn towards saying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Around midnight on 17 January 2015, Miller was spotted by two students at Stanford University being sexually assaulted by a third student as she lay unconscious on the ground behind some bins. She was 22, a recent graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, working in her first job at a tech firm and living with her parents in Palo Alto. Earlier that evening she had, on a whim, agreed to accompany her younger sister to a fraternity party at Stanford University, a 10-minute drive from the house. By the early hours of the morning, Miller was in a hospital having her vagina and anus swabbed by police doctors \u2013 and 19-year-old Brock Turner was in custody. What happened next has become a textbook example of the double standards applied to sexual assault victims and their assailants. While Turner was characterised as a champion swimmer, conscientious student and upstanding young man surely incapable of assault, Miller became the \u201cdrunk girl at the party\u201d. In that moment, her life split in two. To the majority of her friends and family, she was still Chanel \u2013 an anglicised version of her Chinese name, Zhang Xiao Xia \u2013 albeit a more muted version of the woman they knew. Within the legal system, and in a small, dark chamber of her own mind, she was \u201cEmily Doe\u201d, the pseudonym of the \u201cBrock Turner sexual assault victim\u201d, a woman reduced to the sum total of what someone else had done to her. After Turner was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault and sentenced to just six months in prison \u2013 of which he ultimately served three \u2013 Miller read out a victim impact statement in court. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d she said, addressing Turner directly, \u201cbut you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d Over 12 subsequent pages, Miller delineated, with devastating precision, the experience of being sexually assaulted by a man for whom the legal system had more sympathy than his victim. In June 2016, when the statement was published by BuzzFeed, more than 18 million people read it. Three years later, Miller is sitting opposite me in a conference room at a publishing house in New York, her memoir, Know My Name, on the table before us. Miller is slight and softly spoken, with long hair and a mildly sardonic air, the kind of details that the victim in a sexual assault is used to having raised. Since the trial, every decision Miller makes \u2013 what to wear, how to comport herself, the extent to which she should smile or not smile, where she should go and what route she should take to get there \u2013 has, for a split-second, been refracted through what she calls \u201cthe lens of court\u201d, a reflex audit of how her most trivial choices might be levelled against her by lawyers. \u201cI know how to dismiss and turn down the volume on those voices, that question and reprimand,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s all there and it is really inhibiting.\u201d Know My Name is written in vivid, punishing detail. The fraternity house has \u201ca sour, yeasty atmosphere, where you could hear the soles of your shoes unpeeling from sticky floors\u201d. After the assault, Miller\u2019s body is \u201ca nerveless mannequin\u201d. She is bitterly funny about the dehumanising absurdity of the rape processing suite, where, after being swabbed and photographed (\u201cI wondered if I was suppose to smile with teeth, where I should be looking\u201d) she is given some sweatpants and a pamphlet, which together seem to say: \u201cWelcome to the club, here\u2019s your new uniform. In your folder you\u2019ll find guidelines that will lay out the steps of trauma and recovery which may take your entire lifetime.\u201d The amazing thing, says Miller, is that at the time, the circumstances of her assault seemed so open and shut that in her innocence she imagined there was no case to be answered. \u201cIf someone is found humping an unmoving body, what is the case?\u201d she says now. The case was one of consent; Turner pleaded innocent and claimed not only to have asked Miller \u201cif she wanted me to finger her\u201d, but to have asked if she liked it and heard her confirm: \u201cUh-huh.\u201d More broadly, however, the case turned less on the specifics of Miller\u2019s conduct that night and more on her credibility as a victim. Miller\u2019s sexual history, relationship status and the question of whether or not she \u201cdid a lot of partying in college\u201d were all considered permissible points of access for Turner\u2019s defence, as was the fact that, prior to blacking out and waking up in the hospital, she had peed outside. A man who drunkenly takes a leak under a tree is unremarkable; a woman who does so is lewd. There were other biases at work, among them the broad assumption that alcohol excuses sexual assault, particularly on campus. Oddly, this presumption is nowhere more starkly on display than in journalist Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s new book, Talking to Strangers \u2013 the publicity for which promises to examine a \u201cseries of encounters and misunderstandings\u201d between people and in which he quotes extensively from Miller\u2019s case. Set aside, for a moment, the ethics of a man using the raw transcript of a woman\u2019s sexual assault trial to prop up his theory about communication, and focus on Gladwell\u2019s assertion that: \u201cPeople v. Brock Turner is a case about alcohol.\u201d The entire case, Gladwell writes, \u201cturned on the degree of Emily Doe\u2019s drunkenness\u201d. From a narrow legal point of view, Gladwell is correct. But in answer to the question: \u201cHow did an apparently harmless encounter on a dancefloor end in a crime?\u201d Gladwell describes the assault as a \u201ctransparency failure on steroids\u201d, and offers the apparently blithe summary: \u201cA young woman and a young man meet at a party, then proceed to tragically misunderstand each other\u2019s intentions \u2013 and they\u2019re drunk.\u201d Little credence is given to the possibility raised at the trial that Turner, far from \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d the signals from Miller, could have understood them perfectly, nor that the pivotal disinhibiting agent in this case may not have been alcohol but misogyny. An unconscious woman cannot object when a man inserts his fingers and foreign objects into her vagina; what Emily Doe did or didn\u2019t want was irrelevant. At mention of Gladwell, Miller smiles and zips her mouth. Who needs it? But a moment later, she says: \u201cWe say alcohol is the cause, but to me it\u2019s such a small way of thinking. Alcohol could never be the root of something that is part of such a greater pattern: when you look at the thousands of cases [of violence against women], the common thread is not that we are drinking too much. The fact that we continue to minimise and rationalise violence is so insanely damaging. This is not an intellectual conversation; it\u2019s not a time for posturing. And it\u2019s not OK that, in Gladwell\u2019s book, I was treated and regarded as a case, as something locked in, and not as a person who is actively functioning and speaking and writing and prepared to provide my opinion.\u201d She says: \u201cYou have trolls, then you have this very sophisticated way [of writing]; it\u2019s the same amount of damage, but disguised as this reasonable [critique]. It\u2019s so easy for someone to copy and paste these sections from the transcript, to take my statement and analyse it however they may please, but it\u2019s so difficult to live it. I\u2019m not interested in making excuses any more. When a drunk man beats a woman, we don\u2019t say: well the alcohol affected his decision-making. You\u2019re accountable for that behaviour. It\u2019s a crime.\u201d Over the past 18 months, Miller has been emboldened to speak out and ultimately shed her anonymity by the examples of the women testifying against Harvey Weinstein, and by Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony against Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cI watched them literally sacrifice themselves for the greater good, with the single hope that it\u2019s going to help someone. It\u2019s infuriating when we see how much victims have to sacrifice and give away from themselves, and how much we have to speak in gruesome detail about things that feel very private, in order to make this apparent to people. How many times we\u2019re caught in that cycle of saying: \u2018Doesn\u2019t this mean something to you? Why can\u2019t you see me? Why doesn\u2019t this hurt you? Why aren\u2019t you alarmed?\u2019 Each one has propelled me forward, and has cleared out a little more space in order for me to step out today. I think it would have been a much slower process for me coming to terms with going public had they not laid that groundwork.\u201d Does she think Kavanaugh should be impeached? Miller smiles. \u201cI think a lot about that. Hmmm. I think when Christine Blasey Ford or Debbie Ramirez comes forward with their story, it is our job to create a space for them to speak the truth without being automatically converted into political punching bags. And, yes, I do think that people in power need to be held to a higher standard of behaviour. So many of these conversations feel so absurd.\u201d The point about gruesome detail is particularly relevant in Miller\u2019s case; she writes about how it felt to discover, after the fact, that a huge closeup of her exposed genitals had been flashed before the court as part of the presentation of evidence, moments before she walked in to testify. To attach her name to that image; to invite people to imagine her being assaulted was grotesque and terrifying and, in the first instance, she says: \u201cAnonymity was essential to self-preservation and processing.\u201d She was also fearful for her safety. At every stage of the trial and its aftermath, she has received death and rape threats from random men set on defending Turner online. Over time, however, she began to think that the anonymity was cauterising her ability to heal. \u201cWhen you keep something so contained, it restricts you from getting the help and support you need,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping out the bad but the good comes in through that same door.\u201d And what of shame? \u201cOh, of course.

      "body": "<p>If you have young children, you will know that you experience roughly 65 questions per day. Many, including: \u201cWhy do elephants have big ears?\u201d can be answered in a heartbeat. Others such as: \u201cWhy is the sea salty?\u201d need Google. Some, you just have to say: \u201cI have no idea.\u201d The latter comes sporadically, like it did last week.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy, what was the name of my great-great-grandad?\u201d my daughter asked. I paused to think. \u201cI have no clue. Let me phone your grandad to ask.\u201d</p> <p>Grandad (my dad) gave me the name I was looking for. He didn\u2019t know much else because it was so long ago. He was so young; he can barely picture his ancestor\u2019s face.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always wondered about where my family had come from. I have picked up the odd detail here and there from small anecdotes about my father growing up in a northern village in India, but that\u2019s as far as my knowledge goes. I\u2019ve thought about my background many times, but then thought I\u2019ll get around to finding out more tomorrow. If I had known more about my heritage, would I have turned out to be a different person? More well-rounded?</p> <p>I\u2019ve finally figured out why I\u2019ve put it off so many times. Apart from sketchy tales narrated by my parents, I just didn\u2019t know where to start. I did go to India in 2005 to find my roots, but it didn\u2019t amount to much. I was a naive twentysomething, travelling with a backpack and enough mosquito repellent for the whole population of Delhi. Besides, have you seen Who Do You Think You Are? The amount of research to get anywhere seems to require months of planning, travelling and \u2013 I assumed \u2013 a huge budget. But I was wrong.

I intend to get further than I have and not put it off until tomorrow. And given the fact that my offspring keep pestering me about their background, I\u2019d better get cracking.</p> <p>My wife has been even more successful in finding out about her past. My father-in-law has in his possession a handwritten journal in Gujarati, penned by his father. When it was left with the family many decades ago, the other grandad spent months typing up the pages and translating it into English for the new generation to read about their roots.</p> <p>I showed my daughter the diary extracts detailing her great-grandad\u2019s journey from India to Kenya on a steamship that by today\u2019s standards wouldn\u2019t be deemed good enough to sail in a pond, let alone the sea \u2013 she listened with her eyes wide open, jaw on the floor and her mind buzzing. The family names, the stories of his upbringing and the hardships he encountered tripled the child questions quota that week.</p> <p>From being orphaned at the age of 13, trying to raise money for an education, to travelling for days until he arrived in Kenya with hardly any money may sound horrifying to me and you, but in a nine-year-old\u2019s world this is the definition of a brave adventure. Here is someone who is part of her flesh and blood trying to make something from absolutely nothing. What my daughter was reading was an inspiration, and she was so happy to be part of his history.</p> <p>Having children has made me realise why it\u2019s so important to know who you are and where you fit into society. From a wellbeing perspective, it increases understanding of our own identity and place in the world.</p> <p><a href=\"http://shared.web.emory.edu/emory/news/releases/2010/03/children-benefit-if-they-know-about-their-relatives-study-finds.html#.XXAvRC3MzBK\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psychologists believe</a> there are emotional benefits for children in knowing about their family history.

I printed out photographs and stuck them in appropriate places on the family tree. There were pictures of [the children] and their cousins, and then pictures of their mum and dad. It was a case of building up the family,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Sienna and Charles were fascinated about just how many old people came before them. \u201cFor instance, I found a great-grandmother who had been born in Leicester and who frequently travelled to Gran Canaria in the 1920s.\u201d Her photograph was added to the tree.</p> <p>Not only educational and entertaining, building the family tree also helped Charles and Sienna deal with recent bereavement. \u201cThey\u2019d lost their other Nana, their dad\u2019s mum, and then soon after her son [their uncle] died, aged 37,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Their father Adam\u2019s parents split up when he was young, and he was not in touch with his own father. He also knew very little about his own mother\u2019s past. But Nunn was able to use her interest in genealogy to help her grandchildren deal with their loss.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/searching-for-my-past/2019/sep/19/chris-packham-i-wanted-to-know-how-my-parents-lives-were-shaped\">Chris Packham: 'I wanted to know how my parents' lives were shaped'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now aged nine and six, respectively, Charles and Sienna have benefited emotionally in different ways. Sienna was interested in knowing how people were related to each other, so Nunn explained to Sienna that while Rebecca (Nunn\u2019s daughter) was Sienna\u2019s mummy, she (Nunn) was Rebecca\u2019s mummy, another woman was Nunn\u2019s mummy, and so on.</p> <p>Charles took the paper family tree to school and showed his classmates what his grandmother had discovered. He was especially interested in knowing what his ancestors did for a living. The family tree also helped him come to terms with bereavements. \u201cHe understood that life is transient,\u201d says Nunn. \u201cMost of the people on family trees are dead. It made Charles feel that death is normal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c[The children] were interested in my granddad,\u201d says Nunn. \u201cWhen my mum was born in 1927, he was a chauffeur, but by the 1930s he was driving buses. They had been to London and liked the idea of someone who drove a red bus.</p> <p>\u201cThey were sometimes in the workhouse; they were very poor,\u201d she says. The shame and hardship of the workhouse was something the children already knew about. \u201cThey had seen the film Oliver!, and it brought to reality the lives people before them had.\u201d</p> <p>Nunn\u2019s paternal side were grocers and greengrocers, also from London. \u201cWe went back just beyond my great-grandparents.

      "bodyText": "If you have young children, you will know that you experience roughly 65 questions per day. Many, including: \u201cWhy do elephants have big ears?\u201d can be answered in a heartbeat. Others such as: \u201cWhy is the sea salty?\u201d need Google. Some, you just have to say: \u201cI have no idea.\u201d The latter comes sporadically, like it did last week. \u201cDaddy, what was the name of my great-great-grandad?\u201d my daughter asked. I paused to think. \u201cI have no clue. Let me phone your grandad to ask.\u201d Grandad (my dad) gave me the name I was looking for. He didn\u2019t know much else because it was so long ago. He was so young; he can barely picture his ancestor\u2019s face. I\u2019ve always wondered about where my family had come from. I have picked up the odd detail here and there from small anecdotes about my father growing up in a northern village in India, but that\u2019s as far as my knowledge goes. I\u2019ve thought about my background many times, but then thought I\u2019ll get around to finding out more tomorrow. If I had known more about my heritage, would I have turned out to be a different person? More well-rounded? I\u2019ve finally figured out why I\u2019ve put it off so many times. Apart from sketchy tales narrated by my parents, I just didn\u2019t know where to start. I did go to India in 2005 to find my roots, but it didn\u2019t amount to much. I was a naive twentysomething, travelling with a backpack and enough mosquito repellent for the whole population of Delhi. Besides, have you seen Who Do You Think You Are? The amount of research to get anywhere seems to require months of planning, travelling and \u2013 I assumed \u2013 a huge budget. But I was wrong. It\u2019s much easier than I thought with Ancestry. I started painting a family tree as soon as I got back and have been filling out the blanks for the past 14 years. I intend to get further than I have and not put it off until tomorrow. And given the fact that my offspring keep pestering me about their background, I\u2019d better get cracking. My wife has been even more successful in finding out about her past. My father-in-law has in his possession a handwritten journal in Gujarati, penned by his father. When it was left with the family many decades ago, the other grandad spent months typing up the pages and translating it into English for the new generation to read about their roots. I showed my daughter the diary extracts detailing her great-grandad\u2019s journey from India to Kenya on a steamship that by today\u2019s standards wouldn\u2019t be deemed good enough to sail in a pond, let alone the sea \u2013 she listened with her eyes wide open, jaw on the floor and her mind buzzing. The family names, the stories of his upbringing and the hardships he encountered tripled the child questions quota that week. From being orphaned at the age of 13, trying to raise money for an education, to travelling for days until he arrived in Kenya with hardly any money may sound horrifying to me and you, but in a nine-year-old\u2019s world this is the definition of a brave adventure. Here is someone who is part of her flesh and blood trying to make something from absolutely nothing. What my daughter was reading was an inspiration, and she was so happy to be part of his history. Having children has made me realise why it\u2019s so important to know who you are and where you fit into society. From a wellbeing perspective, it increases understanding of our own identity and place in the world. Psychologists believe there are emotional benefits for children in knowing about their family history. You don\u2019t have to be a rocket scientist to believe this. Knowing your past gives you a sense of belonging, which is why I can\u2019t wait to delve into my family history and share my findings with my daughter. Experience: \u2018I drew an enormous family tree on brown parcel paper\u2019 When Viv Nunn decided to show her young grandchildren, Charles and Sienna, how families evolve, she started with a drawing. \u201cI drew an enormous family tree on brown parcel paper. I printed out photographs and stuck them in appropriate places on the family tree. There were pictures of [the children] and their cousins, and then pictures of their mum and dad. It was a case of building up the family,\u201d she says. Sienna and Charles were fascinated about just how many old people came before them. \u201cFor instance, I found a great-grandmother who had been born in Leicester and who frequently travelled to Gran Canaria in the 1920s.\u201d Her photograph was added to the tree. Not only educational and entertaining, building the family tree also helped Charles and Sienna deal with recent bereavement. \u201cThey\u2019d lost their other Nana, their dad\u2019s mum, and then soon after her son [their uncle] died, aged 37,\u201d she says. Their father Adam\u2019s parents split up when he was young, and he was not in touch with his own father. He also knew very little about his own mother\u2019s past. But Nunn was able to use her interest in genealogy to help her grandchildren deal with their loss. Now aged nine and six, respectively, Charles and Sienna have benefited emotionally in different ways. Sienna was interested in knowing how people were related to each other, so Nunn explained to Sienna that while Rebecca (Nunn\u2019s daughter) was Sienna\u2019s mummy, she (Nunn) was Rebecca\u2019s mummy, another woman was Nunn\u2019s mummy, and so on. Charles took the paper family tree to school and showed his classmates what his grandmother had discovered. He was especially interested in knowing what his ancestors did for a living. The family tree also helped him come to terms with bereavements. \u201cHe understood that life is transient,\u201d says Nunn. \u201cMost of the people on family trees are dead. It made Charles feel that death is normal.\u201d \u201c[The children] were interested in my granddad,\u201d says Nunn. \u201cWhen my mum was born in 1927, he was a chauffeur, but by the 1930s he was driving buses. They had been to London and liked the idea of someone who drove a red bus. \u201cThey were sometimes in the workhouse; they were very poor,\u201d she says. The shame and hardship of the workhouse was something the children already knew about. \u201cThey had seen the film Oliver!, and it brought to reality the lives people before them had.\u201d Nunn\u2019s paternal side were grocers and greengrocers, also from London. \u201cWe went back just beyond my great-grandparents. Both sides of my family came from Northamptonshire, around the villages where we live now. I was surprised about this myself,\u201d says Nunn. The children were particularly interested in the photographs Nunn found had been uploaded to Ancestry. \u201cI have a lot of photos of my own family, but we didn\u2019t have many pictures of Adam\u2019s family,\u201d she says. Ancestry had other, older photographs that she had never seen before. \u201cI found my grandparents and great-grandparents on [another relative\u2019s] family tree. There was a lady in nurse\u2019s uniform from the 1920s. There was another of an elderly gentleman working as a labourer. That photograph was from 1900.

He said David Bernhardt, Trump\u2019s interior secretary, is hiring her for her \u201cdeep ties to the swamp and special interests\u201d.</p> <p>Skipwith\u2019s fiance, Leo Giacometto, is a former lobbyist who worked on behalf of Westlands from 2005 to 2010 in his role as the founder of Gage International. Skipwith has said she was an \u201cunpaid adviser\u201d for Gage starting in 2013.</p> <p>Bernhardt, who would be Skipwith\u2019s new boss if she is to be confirmed, also lobbied for Westlands. Bernhardt once sued the US government on behalf of Westlands, aiming to roll back protections for winter-run Chinook salmon in California.</p> <p>Under Bernhardt\u2019s watch, Westlands has benefited from policy changes enacted by the interior department and its subagency, the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p> <p>The interior department is currently working to loosen protections for imperiled fish in California, which would be a boon to Westlands and other irrigators who want to pull more water out of regional rivers and reservoirs. The rollback would likely harm endangered salmon, delta smelt, and other aquatic species in California.</p> <p>As the director of the FWS, Skipwith would be crucially placed to shape the outcome of those efforts.</p> <p>According to Senate lobbying records, Gage, Giacometto\u2019s firm, lobbied for Westlands between 2005 and 2010. During that time, Westlands paid Gage more than $200,000 to influence House and Senate policy on \u201cwater resource management issues\u201d. Gage also lobbied for another influential California water district, the San Luis &amp; Delta Mendota Water Authority, during approximately the same period.</p> <p>Shortly after Westlands ceased work with Gage in 2010, it hired Bernhardt\u2019s former firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck to help lead its lobbying operations.</p> <p>Skipwith is not required to disclose any information about her fiance\u2019s financial ties or involvement with Westlands because they are not yet married. Giacometto was prominent at Skipwith\u2019s confirmation hearing, where he was introduced as her fiance.</p> <p>Skipwith\u2019s ties to Giacometto and Gage, and through them to Westlands, raise questions about whether she will be able to act impartially when making critical decisions about water and wildlife policy in California, which are top priorities for Bernhardt and his interior department. </p> <p>At her confirmation hearing earlier this month, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse highlighted Skipwith\u2019s past work for Monsanto, a leading producer of an herbicide that has been linked to negative effects on honeybees and other wildlife. Skipwith worked for Monsanto between January 2006 and July 2012, according to her resum\u00e9, mainly in crop science and corporate affairs.</p> <p>In a written statement, the interior department said Skipwith is in \u201cfull compliance\u201d with federal ethics rules.</p> <p>Russell Newell, spokesperson for the interior department, said: \u201cMs Skipwith has actively sought and consulted with senior career ethics officials. Ms Skipwith started as an adviser with Gage International in 2013 well after the water district ended its contract with Gage in 2010.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the US Fish and Wildlife Service has links to powerful agricultural interests opposed to protections for endangered species she would oversee, the Guardian has learned. Aurelia Skipwith, who is already a top official at the interior department, formerly worked at the agrochemical giant Monsanto. New revelations show she also has ties to the Westlands Water District, a political powerhouse with a history of chafing against Endangered Species Act regulations that can interfere with farmers\u2019 demands for water in California. Yet a Senate committee approved Skipwith\u2019s nomination Wednesday in a party-line vote of 11-10. Jayson O\u2019Neill, the deputy director of Western Values Project, a public lands watchdog group based in Montana, claimed that Skipwith\u2019s resum\u00e9 \u2013 she is a lawyer with a master\u2019s degree in genetics \u2013 shows she is unqualified. He said David Bernhardt, Trump\u2019s interior secretary, is hiring her for her \u201cdeep ties to the swamp and special interests\u201d. Skipwith\u2019s fiance, Leo Giacometto, is a former lobbyist who worked on behalf of Westlands from 2005 to 2010 in his role as the founder of Gage International. Skipwith has said she was an \u201cunpaid adviser\u201d for Gage starting in 2013. Bernhardt, who would be Skipwith\u2019s new boss if she is to be confirmed, also lobbied for Westlands. Bernhardt once sued the US government on behalf of Westlands, aiming to roll back protections for winter-run Chinook salmon in California. Under Bernhardt\u2019s watch, Westlands has benefited from policy changes enacted by the interior department and its subagency, the Fish and Wildlife Service. The interior department is currently working to loosen protections for imperiled fish in California, which would be a boon to Westlands and other irrigators who want to pull more water out of regional rivers and reservoirs. The rollback would likely harm endangered salmon, delta smelt, and other aquatic species in California. As the director of the FWS, Skipwith would be crucially placed to shape the outcome of those efforts. According to Senate lobbying records, Gage, Giacometto\u2019s firm, lobbied for Westlands between 2005 and 2010. During that time, Westlands paid Gage more than $200,000 to influence House and Senate policy on \u201cwater resource management issues\u201d. Gage also lobbied for another influential California water district, the San Luis &amp; Delta Mendota Water Authority, during approximately the same period. Shortly after Westlands ceased work with Gage in 2010, it hired Bernhardt\u2019s former firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck to help lead its lobbying operations. Skipwith is not required to disclose any information about her fiance\u2019s financial ties or involvement with Westlands because they are not yet married. Giacometto was prominent at Skipwith\u2019s confirmation hearing, where he was introduced as her fiance. Skipwith\u2019s ties to Giacometto and Gage, and through them to Westlands, raise questions about whether she will be able to act impartially when making critical decisions about water and wildlife policy in California, which are top priorities for Bernhardt and his interior department. At her confirmation hearing earlier this month, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse highlighted Skipwith\u2019s past work for Monsanto, a leading producer of an herbicide that has been linked to negative effects on honeybees and other wildlife. Skipwith worked for Monsanto between January 2006 and July 2012, according to her resum\u00e9, mainly in crop science and corporate affairs. In a written statement, the interior department said Skipwith is in \u201cfull compliance\u201d with federal ethics rules. Russell Newell, spokesperson for the interior department, said: \u201cMs Skipwith has actively sought and consulted with senior career ethics officials. Ms Skipwith started as an adviser with Gage International in 2013 well after the water district ended its contract with Gage in 2010.\u201d",

Somerset, who must beat leaders Essex to overtake them, are in the unenviable position of needing to take 20 wickets on Thursday to claim the title for the first time.</p> <p> Hurry said: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the end. Our challenge now becomes stiffer, but it\u2019s important having demonstrated throughout the whole season courage, conviction and belief that we don\u2019t lose that overnight.</p> <p>We\u2019ve put too much on the line for too long a period to wave the white flag. It\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. We\u2019re also about the future as well, and making sure we put down a marker for next year.\u201d <br></p> <p>In the play that has been possible at Taunton this week, Somerset made 203 in their first innings, with Essex 25 for no wicket in reply.<br></p> <p>Even if the weather improves, and there is a kinder forecast for Thursday, Essex should avoid the ignominy of being bowled out twice to win a second Championship title in three seasons. <br></p> <p>But Hurry said: \u201cIt\u2019s important we turn up in the morning in the right frame of mind and give it 100%. And it\u2019s a funny old game. This summer we\u2019ve seen some amazing cricket and some huge twists and turns.</p> <p>\u201cAnything can happen - and we\u2019ve got to keep believing. <br>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get runs on the board and bowl them out.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8b8b298f08fbb0c171b561\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-25T15:49:56.229Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summing up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>So, Essex are ever closer</strong> to a second title in three years and an eighth in their history, leaving Somerset still chasing that elusive pennant. The home side are going to need an almighty clatter of wickets tomorrow to snatch the crown and Essex are surely too strong to let that happen. Aren\u2019t they? Elsewhere, the weather also looks like confirming the promotions of Northants and Gloucestershire, who are at least playing at the moment, against each other (Gloucs 164-6 since you ask). </p> <p>Anyway, stick around on the site for the thoughts of our man in Taunton, Vic Marks, and why not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/audio/2019/sep/25/will-essex-or-rain-spoil-somersets-party-the-spin-podcast-goes-to-taunton\">give The Spin a listen on your way home</a>?

      "bodyText": "The Somerset director of cricket, Andy Hurry, insists his players will not \u201cwave the white flag\u201d despite rivals Essex being on the brink of County Championship glory heading in to the final day of the season. No play was possible on the third day of the Taunton title decider, with umpires Alex Wharf and Rob Bailey ruling a damp area in front of the pavilion unplayable after the rain finally relented. Somerset, who must beat leaders Essex to overtake them, are in the unenviable position of needing to take 20 wickets on Thursday to claim the title for the first time. Hurry said: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the end. Our challenge now becomes stiffer, but it\u2019s important having demonstrated throughout the whole season courage, conviction and belief that we don\u2019t lose that overnight. We\u2019ve put too much on the line for too long a period to wave the white flag. It\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. We\u2019re also about the future as well, and making sure we put down a marker for next year.\u201d In the play that has been possible at Taunton this week, Somerset made 203 in their first innings, with Essex 25 for no wicket in reply. Even if the weather improves, and there is a kinder forecast for Thursday, Essex should avoid the ignominy of being bowled out twice to win a second Championship title in three seasons. But Hurry said: \u201cIt\u2019s important we turn up in the morning in the right frame of mind and give it 100%. And it\u2019s a funny old game. This summer we\u2019ve seen some amazing cricket and some huge twists and turns. \u201cAnything can happen - and we\u2019ve got to keep believing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get runs on the board and bowl them out.\u201d So, Essex are ever closer to a second title in three years and an eighth in their history, leaving Somerset still chasing that elusive pennant. The home side are going to need an almighty clatter of wickets tomorrow to snatch the crown and Essex are surely too strong to let that happen. Aren\u2019t they? Elsewhere, the weather also looks like confirming the promotions of Northants and Gloucestershire, who are at least playing at the moment, against each other (Gloucs 164-6 since you ask). Anyway, stick around on the site for the thoughts of our man in Taunton, Vic Marks, and why not give The Spin a listen on your way home? Thanks for your emails, tweets and comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for \u2013 hopefully \u2013 some of yer actual cricket, any cricket. Bye. No dice from that 4.30pm inspection, problems being not just the ever-present rain threat but the state of the outfield, so today is a washout. The 2019 championship, the 2019 season, doesn\u2019t deserve such a damp squib of an ending. It\u2019s been dry for an hour or so now at Taunton, so \u201cwe might get an hour or so in\u201d, says Sky\u2019s Nick Knight. Meanwhile, let\u2019s have a scores-on-the-doors roundup: Division One: Canterbury: Kent 147 v Hampshire 80-3 (no play Wednesday, rain); Taunton: Somerset 203 v Essex 25-0 (inspection, 4.30pm); The Oval: Surrey 402-6dec v Notts 5-0 (in play); Edgbaston: Yorkshire 261-2 v Warwickshire (no play Wednesday, rain) Division Two: Chester-le-Street: Durham 262-8 v Glamorgan (no play Wednesday, rain); Bristol: Gloucestershire 143-6 v Northants (in play); Leicester: Leicestershire 155 v Lancashire 118-7 (in play); Lord\u2019s: Middlesex 260 v Derbyshire 138-4 (in play) \u201cIf Durham and Glammy do forfeits, then Glammy can\u2019t get enough bonus points to catch TMN,\u201d points out Rooto below the line (my miscalculation \u2013 this is why I\u2019m not a county captain), \u201cso Rossington might be tempted to do the same with Gloucs \u2013 or at least dare Gloucs to set a target. This thought got me slightly excited about tomorrow\u2019s cricket, until I then looked at the weather forecast for Bristol tomorrow...\u201d Well they\u2019ve taken the covers off there again now, which constitutes excitement on a day like this. No sooner do I report that they\u2019re playing at Bristol then a Gloucestershire-supporting source texts. \u201cOff in Bristol,\u201d he parps unhappily. \u201cSheltering in Hammond Bar,\u201d he adds, rather more happily. So that one\u2019s almost certainly a draw, inviting the question: will Durham offer to make a game of it against promotion-chasing Glamorgan tomorrow, with innings-forfeits and such? Should they? There is actual play up the road from Taunton at Bristol, where Gloucestershire have advance briskly from 80 for 6 to 124 for 6, Ben Charlesworth unbeaten on 47. Their promotion looks in the bag though, with Glamorgan unable to get on the field today at Durham, who are 262 for 8 in their first innings. And at the Oval, Notts have finally got rid of Scott Borthwick, caught by Jake Ball off Steven Mullaney for 137, and Will Jacks, lbw to the same bowler for 17. Rikki Clarke has biffed three fours and a six though, and Surrey are 380 for 6. Derbyshire are 110 for 4 replying to Middlesex\u2019s 260. Play not abandoned yet. The umpires are going to have another look at 4.30pm. These are my straws and I\u2019m clutching at them. Of course it\u2019ll start getting dark by 7. Because, you know, it\u2019s late September, the perfect time of year for Really Important Cricket. No sooner had I drifted into a nostalgic reverie about the dramatic denouement of the golden Championship summer of 1984, than we\u2019ve launched an article on that very thing. The best title race finish ever? It\u2019d certainly give 2016 a run for its money. Weather news: it\u2019s not raining at the moment, and the umpires have just been out giving the outfield another once-over; they look worried about the dampness though. The pitch itself is still under cover, as an understandable precaution. More as we get it \u2026 Gary Naylor got here way before most of the rest of us with player-based verbs. He wrote this, way back in 2007. Lots to enjoy here. Choice cuts: \u201cKallis (v.t) \u2013 To selfishly guard something painstakingly accumulated over years in the mistaken belief that anyone else cares about it. \u2018We didn\u2019t go on holiday for three years as all the money was spent converting the loft so he could kallis his Hornby train set in there\u2019.\u201d And as we\u2019re doing an Essex match: \u201cPetersuch (v) \u2013 to achieve far beyond the parameters of your natural talents. \u2018I resent the accusation that Steve McClaren has petersuched his way into the England manager\u2019s job, he was the 4th person on my list after all.\u2019 Brian Barwick, 2006\u201d More verbing: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was ever a thing,\u201d writes Kim Thonger, \u201cbut someone dismissed by stumping by that marvellous Indian cricketer Farokh Engineer, should surely have considered themselves \u2018engineered\u2019?\u201d And we could all have hailed feats of Engineer-ing etc. And a pithy one from Geoff Wignall: \u201cI\u2019m not sure about players\u2019 names used as verbs - to Sober is certainly not in homage to the GOAT - but maybe the reverse happened with to boycott entertainment/ team spirit/ sportsmanship/ basic human decency.\u201d Quirky nostalgia stat-nugget: If it rains all day tomorrow, Essex will have won the title at Taunton without playing for the second time. The previous occasion was a proper cliff-hanger in 1984, when Somerset beat Nottinghamshire by three runs, the visitors\u2019 defeat handing Essex \u2013 who had completed victory against Lancashire a day earlier \u2013 the title. I\u2019ve got fond, hazy childhood memories of listening to the closing stages of this one on the Radio Four news at dinner time, in days when they\u2019d actually interrupt the news for county cricket thrills and spills. Let\u2019s return to those times \u2013 it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s much else going on in the news after all. Thanks Tanya, well this is maddening isn\u2019t it? Rain! In late September! Whodda thunk it? Whodda scheduled it? I\u2019m not actually in Taunton, so not able to alleviate the frustration by ambling around a cricket ground (one of life\u2019s great pleasures), but gazing out on what are currently quite sunny conditions in That London, for what it\u2019s worth. Two matches are taking place in the capital, of no great significance, where Surrey have mooched along to 339 for 4 against doomed Notts at The Oval (2013\u2019s Scott Borthwick is 134 not out), and Derbyshire are 90 for 3 in reply to Middlesex\u2019s 260 I went for my walk. The umpires came out. Loyal Somerset fans came through the gates. A huddle of over-tankered fans sang, \u201ctake the covers off\u201d to the tune of KC and the Sunshine Band\u2019s Give it up. Then it started to rain again. We\u2019re taking tea at three and then, well, who knows? But, and apologies, that\u2019s Somerset\u2019s Championship dreams over for another year. Anyway (clear\u2019s throat) that\u2019s it from me for today, I\u2019m handing over to Tom Davies. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon, and thank you very much for all the emails and chat BTL. Till tomorrow, ta-ra! Here, at last, through the ether, is Poppy. And how could we forget this? Thanks Dave. Round the counties - there will be an inspection at 2 at Canterbury and Gloucester, 2.30 here and Hove, 2.45 at The Riverside, There will be no play at Edgbaston today. So we have THREE games where the players have made it to the middle. Lords: Middlesex 260 (Malan 72) v Derbyshire 40-0 Grace Road: Leicestershire 155 (Gleeson 6-43) v Lancashire 5-1 (of course it was Keaton, bowled for 0) And The Oval, where Surrey are 302-3 v Notts, with the marvellous glory that is Ollie Pope just out for 106. Thank you! So we\u2019ve got Cooked (thank you Malcolm Ogilvie), Mankaded, Dilshaned, Tino\u2019d (Pettsvaldo), Waqared (Oharar). \u201cHi Tanya,\u201d writes Geoff Wignall. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose it was a cunning plan, but....CC finale in 4th week of Sept; no enthralling climax in the rain; so need for a new competition to create new enthusiasm: Ladeez an\u2019 Gentermen, I give you The Hundred!\u201d Geoff, you could be on to something. But the weather doesn\u2019t always play ball even in the summer... I\u2019m sure the ECB are on it. Apropros of nothing much, I\u2019ve been reading a book called When in French, Love in a second language which is very good, if typed in very small print. Anyway, it talked about the French verb zlataner, to amaze or dominate, coined after the footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It got me wondering about verbs named after cricketers. I\u2019ve used Morkelled which, in my head at least, means delivering a stump splattering. There must be more. And the latest news is that there will be a further inspection at 2.30pm, with the skies looking slightly brighter and the groundstaff folding some of the covers away. A nice lunch btw, couscous salad and coleslaw followed by toffee apple tart. Something to listen to in your lunch hour. 8 Back in 1980, Botham scored 228 against Gloucester, 180 odd between lunch &amp; tea. Does Vic have any memories of this rather speedy innings? I was playing, I\u2019m sure I enjoyed the innings, but my main memory is that we failed to win and Zaheer caressed me all around Taunton while saving the game for Gloucester. And that is the end of ASK VIC for today as we are going to find some lunch which is being served in the Ondaatje pavilion. In even better news - the covers are coming off! 7 Has Leach spent a lot of time with Trescothick honing his batting technique? It certainly looks like it. In which case, this helps make the case for a role in the England coaching set up for Tres wouldn\u2019t you say? Probably. He almost looks like him if you half-close your eyes. Marcus has already done some work with England, he was around in one or two of the Test matches helping and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got much to offer as a batting coach. He may still be wary of a permanent role because of the amount of travelling required. He has plenty of options I\u2019m sure which may involve a combination of coaching, broadcasting and he has also been employed by one of the local schools in the winter. He\u2019d probably make a good selector too. I was lucky enough to be present for the 705/9d against Hampshire in 2003 - what\u2019s the best team innings you\u2019ve ever seen at Taunton? I was at the other end when Viv Richards hit a triple century against Warwickshire in 1985 and my main contribution was managing not to run him out. However, off the top of my head, I remember in 1984 a run-chase against Leicester in what Peter Willey at the toss described as \u201cproper game of bloody cricket\u201d since he was deputising as captain for Gower and I was deputising for Botham. He set us a challenging fourth-innings target with Andy Roberts and, I think, Jonathan Agnew in his attack and Martin Crowe hit a sublime century with Peter Roebuck making one that wasn\u2019t quite so sublime but invaluable. 5 What would be your XI for the first test in New Zealand? And who should be the next England Coach? Burns, Sibley, Denly, Root, Stokes, Pope, Buttler, S Curran, Archer, Broad, Leach. The next England coach: if it was internal, Chris Silverwood would most likely get the job. The problem is that the most experienced coaches and maybe the wisest have decided they prefer an IPL franchise or even a surprisingly lucrative gig in the Hundred to the rigours of ten months on the road. So this enhances the chances of England reverting to an English coach. This time, however, it might not be Peter Moores. 4 Hameed? On Hameed, perhaps Somerset would be a good new home if only on the basis that it is just about the furthest point away from Old Trafford. And he is a very good player of spin which sometimes helps round here. 3 I was told once in my early career as a Lanky supporter that Lanky flogged Somerset within an inch of it\u2019s life and to this day it still brings on the tremors to a Somerset player/fan if you mention Archie MacLaren and Lanky\u2019s 801 and the flogging in three days. Is this still so Vic? Well, Archie MacLaren scored 424 at Taunton against Somerset - I know this because in 1988 as we were wearily clapping Graeme Hick on his way to the pavilion on 405 not out I churlishly mentioned that MacLaren got many more than that. In one of my last Sunday league games in a forlorn chase at Worcester I hit Graeme Hick for two sixes. \u201cI owe you 43 more I said.\u201d Boom, boom. 2 Of all the spinners to play in a World Cup for England, which were the three best performances in a tournament? Well, obviously me! 5-39 v Sri Lanka at Taunton in 1983 on a slightly drier day than today. No idea about the others though... 1 Who should Somerset sign next year? Overseas and/or local? Well, our bowling stocks are as strong as they\u2019ve ever been assuming we keep all our players (Dom Bess especially) so we need a top-order rock-solid someone. Warner? He may not be required at Test level too often. More seriously, there are not that many top openers around. They are very hard to find now especially on a long-term basis so it may well be a big year for Eddie Byrom who played in the first match of the season and hasn\u2019t been since against the red ball since. He was renowned as an old-fashioned crease occupier at the start of the season but by August he had transformed into a one-day basher. Somewhere in between is a damned good player. With no sign of the umpires peering at the pitch, there comes the announcement that lunch will be taken at 12.40. I\u2019ve got a lovely picture of Poppy the black labrador to cheer you up but my b**** phone won\u2019t send it to me. Apologies to Poppy\u2019s owner if you\u2019re reading this - hopefully the photo might come through to me in the next 6 hours. Paul Frame has emailed in to ask the state of the Division Two title race. Quite right Paul, so this is what I think is the case. Please let me know if I\u2019m wrong. Northants currently have 181 points, Gloucestershire 176 and Glamorgan 160. So Northants need a further two points to secure promotion and Glamorgan need to win with max points to overtake Gloucestershire, which seems unlikely in the current weather situation. A team is awarded 16 points for a victory, with both sides earning eight points for a tie and five points apiece if a match is drawn. Plus bonus points. No luck with Brian, but that could be because, I\u2019m sorry to say, it is now raining hard. Press box now smells of damp coats and is getting steamy in a deeply un-erotic kind of way. But, I have Vic Marks here who is available to answer any of your questions about Somerset and more, so do ask questions BTL or via email and we can start the first series of ASK VIC. Ok, so I\u2019ve got some info on Brian the cat. His real name isn\u2019t Brian but he was named after someone who worked at Somerset who has ginger hair. He doesn\u2019t belong to the club but lives with loving owners who work long hours, and mooches over to the club for some attention during the day. These owners were unaware that their cat had a twitter feed until a couple of weeks ago. I shall hunt for him now. The umpires have spoken: we have another inspection at noon. And I\u2019m afraid the skies are darkening again. Still, I\u2019ve got my hands on some bourbons so all is not lost. Ah, I know some of you have been doing this BTL, but the Beeb also have their CC team of the year. Sibley, Alastair Cook, Labuschagne, Northeast, Malan, Vilas, Higgins, Gregory, Harmer, Abbott, Rushworth. Ah here we have the three umpires. Black trousers, white shirts neatly tucked in. They stamp on the outfield with their matching white trainers, trying to squeeze water out of a sponge. One has a rolled up umbrella that he is swinging with a jaunty air. Round the covers they walk with the groundsman - how much is there to talk about I wonder? Perhaps they\u2019re just comparing breakfasts. Play at Lord\u2019s will start at 11.15 am if there is no further rain. We\u2019re down to three plastic rain sheets and the wheel-on covers now at Taunton, I\u2019m sniffing a noon start in the breeze. The drainage lines that are so prominent when you watch on the television are just as prominent on the ground, criss-crossing the grass like archaeological remains suddenly visible after a dry summer. I was talking to a journalist who has covered Somerset for many years and he was saying how much more interesting the cricket was here now than when teams scored 400 then 600 and everything was drawn. So in the good-natured end-of-season spirit of CCLive!, can anyone else come up with things that have got better in the last 15 years? Email me, go on. Oh BP, I wish I\u2019d seen your post BTL. No sign of Brian but I will go and search I promise. The stands are slowly filling up here, and I\u2019m tempted to return to the ice-cream stand where they sell chocolate chuckle, honeycomb and vegan chocolate cones. Ok, so things are looking up. The rain has stopped and they are pulling the sheets off and doing things with hoses. It\u2019s actually quite warm though I\u2019ve got soggy trousers after sitting on one of the benches to watch a shaggy golden retriever. The floodlights are off. No play before lunch at Grace Road, Edgbaston, The Riverside, Hove or Canterbury. A delayed start at The Oval and Bristol due to a wet outfield but, promisingly, just drizzle reported at Lord\u2019s. This is the scene. Good morning from a soggy Taunton, where the sky is slate and the groundstaff, who were pulling sheets off the field when I arrived, are now pulling them back on again. The super sopper zips backwards and forwards round the boundary edge, as if ironing a particularly stubborn shirt. There will be an inspection at 11am. It\u2019s all a great shame as both teams reckon this is only a 200-over game. However, in the definition of optimism, a few hardy souls settle into the Sir Ian Botham stand, an hour before the scheduled start. Hoods up, arms folded, stoicism origami - this is county cricket in late September! I\u2019m going to walk round the ground now to find a coffee, back in 15 minutes.",

The reason is that it imposes contradictory demands on the Democrats, which leave them no easy way out.</p> <p>On one hand, the evidence that Trump may have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/24/20879909/trump-ukraine-impeachment-mueller-russia\">abused his powers</a> in a variety of ways since assuming office is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. If these actions do indeed amount to \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2013 or even just a violation of his oath to protect the US constitution \u2013 then it is not just Congress\u2019s constitutional right, but also its legal duty, to initiate impeachment proceedings.</p> <p>What Nancy Pelosi said about Trump in her announcement yesterday also applies to Congress as a whole: \u201cNobody is above the law\u201d. So, if crimes have been committed, they must be pursued \u2013 and impeachment is the procedure specified by the constitution for this type of pursuit.</p> <p>On the other hand, from a political point of view, the legal drama that is now set to unfold will most likely harm Democrats. This is not just because there is very little chance that the Republican-controlled Senate will ultimately vote to depose the president by a wide enough margin; and if that fails to happen, the whole thing may well backfire as it did for the Republicans after their failed attempt to depose Bill Clinton by impeachment in 1998.</p> <p>There is a deeper reason why attempting to impeach Trump is politically counter-productive for Democrats. Up until now, the momentum in the presidential campaign was clearly on their side. Even though Trump\u2019s core basis of electoral support has proved surprisingly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/24/trumps-approval-ratings-are-bad-news-democrats/\">resilient</a>, his opponents were on the offensive on a number of key substantive issues, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/13/18103087/medicare-for-all-explained-single-payer-health-care-sanders-jayapal\">healthcare</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/climate/green-new-deal-questions-answers.html\">environment</a>, up to the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/analysis-how-financially-concerned-and-comfortable-democrats-differ-on-economy-and-2020-candidates/\">economy</a> (especially if, as seems likely, the country is now headed towards a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/22/recession-will-hit-the-us-within-12-months-david-rosenberg-warns.html\">recession</a>, in no small part because of Trump\u2019s unpopular <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/oecd-says-trump-china-trade-war-linked-global-economic-slowdown-1460250\">trade war</a> with China).</p> <p>Despite its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/03/democratic-debates-control-trump-campaign\">procedural flaws</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/31/democrats-2020-primary-1140793\">deep disagreements</a> it has laid bare, the Democratic primary process has so far demonstrated an ideological vitality and combativeness that hadn\u2019t been seen for decades, either within the US Democratic Party or, frankly, any other left-leaning political force in consolidated Western democracies.

She added: \u201cI don\u2019t have a specific location information to provide. I\u2019m in an offsite location. I\u2019m not allowed to release that type of information. I\u2019m in the United States.\u201d It has also emerged that in 2016 Arcuri admitted that Hacker House employed the hacker Lauri Love, who is wanted by the US authorities for breaking into US websites. She told Love\u2019s extradition hearing in 2016 that she met him the previous year and at the time he worked for Hacker House from Thursday to Monday. Arcuri\u2019s husband, Matthew Hickey, claimed on Twitter that the company employed several \u201cseveral British people\u201d. According to LinkedIn, only four of the 11 employees recorded on the site are located in the UK, and one of them is Arcuri, who moved to the US last year. In the House of Commons, Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cThe truth is our prime minister does reckless things. He is a man whose character renders him unfit for the office he holds.\u201d Johnson is under increasing pressure to explain his friendship with Arcuri, whose east London flat was reportedly visited frequently by the prime minister while he was in City Hall. She also attended three overseas trade missions led by Johnson and was given tens of thousands of pounds in City Hall funds during his time as mayor. The Sunday Times, which broke the story, said it had found the registered address on the grant application form was a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her. The Lib Dem MP Layla Moran tabled an urgent question asking why Hacker House received the grant this year and whether Johnson was involved in the award of the grant. Referring to his proroguing of parliament having been found to be unlawful, she said: \u201cThe fact that we are back in the Commons today is because the prime minister has been shown to ride roughshod over the laws of this land. It would indeed be disappointing if we were to find that the prime minister has form in bending the rules for personal or political gain.\u201d She also pointed out that the \u00a3100,000 grant exceeded 50% of the company\u2019s income and thus broke one of the criteria for the scheme. She asked: \u201cWhy did officials waive the rule that the grant could not exceed 50% of the company\u2019s collective income?\u201d Warman said neither the prime minister nor any MP had lobbied for the money, but that the department had launched a review of the process. \u201cThe prime minister and his staff had no role in the awarding of this grant,\u201d he said. Arcuri\u2019s company Innotech was given \u00a310,000 in sponsorship from a mayoral organisation in 2013, the Sunday Times reported. Johnson was also the guest speaker at several of its events, and appeared in a Google hangout alongside Arcuri. \u201cI\u2019m always happy to hang out at Innotech,\u201d the then mayor told Arcuri in 2014. A year later Arcuri won a \u00a315,000 grant under a government programme to encourage foreign entrepreneurs in the UK, the Sunday Times report alleged. The newspaper suggested that Arcuri was initially refused permission to attend two of the trade trips because her business did not meet the eligibility criteria. But after an intervention by Johnson, she was allowed on to the missions, according to an email seen by the paper. The Guardian disclosed that in 2014 Arcuri\u2019s company hosted a \u201ctech v brains\u201d summit in parliament that was booked by the Tory MP George Freeman, who backed Johnson in the Conservative leadership race and serves as a minister in his government. Freeman and Arcuri took part in a panel discussion at the event with entrepreneurs and policymakers about \u201cthe digital revolution\u201d. Pictures show guests enjoying drinks and pat\u00e9, tofu and mini chicken poppadom canap\u00e9s at the event. Commercial rates for a half-day event in the terrace pavilion are \u00a33,000. Len Duvall, the chair of the Greater London assembly oversight committee, has written to Johnson requesting details and a timeline of all contact with Arcuri during his time in office, demanding a response within a fortnight. Johnson\u2019s successor as mayor, Sadiq Khan, has ordered an inquiry into the alleged conflict of interest, asking the London fire brigade general counsel, Kathryn Robinson, to report back on the issue.",

President Reuven Rivlin is required by law to choose a candidate tasked with forming a government within a week, although amid the deadlock he has pressed for the bickering politicians to join forces instead. On Wednesday his office released a statement saying the president would meet with Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Benny Gantz at his apartment for further talks. The statement said the president had already made preparations to announce a candidate as early a 8pm (6pm BST). It was unclear if the announcement was a tactic to pressure the two candidates to agree to work together or a genuine intention to pick one of them. The central election committee released an official vote tally earlier on Wednesday, showing Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party one seat behind the Blue and White party, run by the former military chief Gantz. Critically, neither had enough support from lawmakers in the 120-seat Knesset to form a majority coalition. There was, however, little optimism they could forge a deal, as both men have demanded the top seat. Gantz, whose election campaign focused on ending the prime minister\u2019s 13-year rule, has also repeatedly pledged not to serve with Netanyahu while he faces three potential indictments for corruption. There is a precedent in Israel for political rivals to serve together after Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres rotated the role of prime minister in the mid-1980s, each agreeing to serve two years. If they do reach an agreement, Netanyahu would be under added pressure to serve first. Prime ministers are not required to step down if indicted for corruption and his pre-trial hearing is set for early October. He has denied all allegations. Rivlin faces a tough challenge but has attempted to show progress. His office released a photograph of the three men clasping hands at a Monday meeting. \u201cThe responsibility for establishing a government falls on you, and the people expect you to find a solution,\u201d Rivlin told Netanyahu and Gantz. Israeli media reported that negotiations have focused on policy issues to build confidence, rather than solely the big questions of who leads and who gets which ministerial post. Gantz told his followers on Tuesday evening that Blue and White had gone into negotiations \u201cwith an open mind and heart\u201d. But he added: \u201cThat said, it is important that everyone understands that we will not relinquish our principles or our partners.\u201d Further complicating talks, Netanyahu struck an agreement with rightwing and religious parties that back him to make sure they are part of any future government. Sticking to the bloc could stonewall negotiations as Gantz has promised to run only in a secular government. His Blue and White party wants civil marriage and to open shops on the sabbath, a holy day of rest. These issues could be deal-breakers for religious politicians. If negotiations break down, the president can choose either candidate, who will then have up to six weeks to form a majority government. If that person fails, Rivlin can ask a second person. That scenario played out in May after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition after a similar election result. But rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance.

As it is, Pochettino must try to convince his handful of morose cockerels to give a flying one again by other means. Maybe he could do some one-to-one motivational exercises with them in his office.

During the call, Trump asked Zelenskiy to \u201clook into\u201d the closed investigation of Biden\u2019s son, telling him repeatedly he would put him in touch with Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer with ties to Trump and a former mayor of New York City.</p> \n<p>Zelenskiy appeared eager to please Trump in the call, calling him a \u201cgreat teacher\u201d and echoing his criticisms of European leaders and the former US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom Zelenskiy called a \u201cbad ambassador\u201d. Zelenskiy also assured Trump that the next Ukrainian prosecutor would be \u201c100% my person\u201d and would \u201clook into the situation\u201d surrounding Biden and the company Burisma. It is not clear whether Zelenskiy did speak with Giuliani.</p> \n<p>He also pointedly told Trump that he had stayed at Trump Tower in New York City. Foreign delegations are thought to stay at Trump properties to curry favour with him.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday evening, Zelenskiy had sought to clear the air with a statement saying he wanted Kyiv\u2019s relations with Washington to be \u201cawesome\u201d and that he planned to invite the US president to visit Ukraine. If Trump accepts, it would be the first visit by an American president since George W Bush in 2008.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe most important thing is that [people] speak about Ukraine, that nobody forgets about Ukraine,\u201d he said in the public remarks.</p> \n<p>Pavlo Klimkin, the previous Ukrainian foreign minister, wrote with an acid sense of pride: \u201cUkraine will remain in the history of the United States as the country that led to the impeachment of the US president.

Ukraine, which counts on US political support and military aid to help repel its larger neighbour Russia, could end up being treated like a political football in the upcoming impeachment battle and the 2020 elections, even as it grapples with larger issues of security and reforms. \u201cI am afraid that Ukraine could become as toxic as Russia was during the Mueller investigation,\u201d said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the Kyiv-based New Europe Center. \u201cWe understand that every move that Trump does in Ukraine will be seen through this scandal.

The Ukrainian president said that he didn\u2019t want to get involved in American elections, but added: \u201cNobody pushed me.\u201d Trump chimed in: \u201cIn other words, no pressure.\u201d The White House on Wednesday released a memorandum of the telephone call between Trump and Zelenskiy. During the call, Trump asked Zelenskiy to \u201clook into\u201d the closed investigation of Biden\u2019s son, telling him repeatedly he would put him in touch with Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer with ties to Trump and a former mayor of New York City. Zelenskiy appeared eager to please Trump in the call, calling him a \u201cgreat teacher\u201d and echoing his criticisms of European leaders and the former US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom Zelenskiy called a \u201cbad ambassador\u201d. Zelenskiy also assured Trump that the next Ukrainian prosecutor would be \u201c100% my person\u201d and would \u201clook into the situation\u201d surrounding Biden and the company Burisma. It is not clear whether Zelenskiy did speak with Giuliani. He also pointedly told Trump that he had stayed at Trump Tower in New York City. Foreign delegations are thought to stay at Trump properties to curry favour with him. On Tuesday evening, Zelenskiy had sought to clear the air with a statement saying he wanted Kyiv\u2019s relations with Washington to be \u201cawesome\u201d and that he planned to invite the US president to visit Ukraine. If Trump accepts, it would be the first visit by an American president since George W Bush in 2008. \u201cThe most important thing is that [people] speak about Ukraine, that nobody forgets about Ukraine,\u201d he said in the public remarks. Pavlo Klimkin, the previous Ukrainian foreign minister, wrote with an acid sense of pride: \u201cUkraine will remain in the history of the United States as the country that led to the impeachment of the US president. Not a very fun prospect. But now everyone understands what we are capable of.\u201d Ukrainian diplomats and Zelenskiy himself have sought to downplay the scandal. In remarks to Russian journalists in New York on Wednesday morning, Zelenskiy denied that Trump pressured him in the 25 July call. \u201cNobody can put pressure on me because I am the president of an independent country,\u201d he said. The only person who could pressure him, he added, \u201cis my son, who is six\u201d. That contradicted an account by Chris Murphy, a member of the US Senate foreign relations committee, who described both Zelenskiy and his administration in recent meetings as \u201cconfused\u201d about \u201cthe nature of these demands they were getting from the Trump administration \u2026 and that they worry that the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness, at the time, to investigate the Bidens\u201d. A European diplomat in Kyiv called Zelenskiy\u2019s predicament a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d where \u201cthere is almost no middle ground\u201d between Trump and the Democratic party. Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst, said that Zelenskiy\u2019s administration had chosen a strategy of \u201cstrict neutrality\u201d in order to avoid angering Trump or a possible Democratic administration, should Biden or another candidate win in 2020. \u201cThe Democrats or Trump could be offended, in particular Trump, by the lack of support, but it\u2019s a necessary position for Ukraine,\u201d he said. Ironically, Fesenko said, the announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry could take some pressure off Zelenskiy this week, as Trump\u2019s actions were closely scrutinised by the press. \u201cTrump would have to be crazy to come out and put pressure on Zelenskiy now [about Biden],\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>The immense silliness of this high-concept, time-shift cop thriller about a detective solving a murder case with help from the victim phoning from two weeks before her death makes it virtually impossible to take seriously. Even with an intelligent, credible performance by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-oyelowo\">David Oyelowo</a>, the daftness and utter implausibility of a smartphone so smart it can make calls to the future is overwhelming.</p> <p>The opening 15 minutes are entertaining enough: this is the bit before the time-travel tricksiness. Don\u2019t Let Go is set in LA, where detective Jack Radcliff (Oyelowo), a good cop and solid dependable guy, keeps an eye on his teenage niece Ashley (beautifully played by Storm Reid) whose dad is struggling with addiction. One day, Jack gets a panicky call from Ashley, and, rushing over to her house, walks into a crime scene in which everyone is dead. Days later, paralysed by grief, he gets a call from Ashley. She sounds cheery and very much undead.</p> <p>Jack deduces that she is speaking to him from another time period \u2013 two weeks before her murder. Director and co-writer Jacob Estes explains nothing. Has there been some freaky fold in the fabric of time?

      "bodyText": "The immense silliness of this high-concept, time-shift cop thriller about a detective solving a murder case with help from the victim phoning from two weeks before her death makes it virtually impossible to take seriously. Even with an intelligent, credible performance by David Oyelowo, the daftness and utter implausibility of a smartphone so smart it can make calls to the future is overwhelming. The opening 15 minutes are entertaining enough: this is the bit before the time-travel tricksiness. Don\u2019t Let Go is set in LA, where detective Jack Radcliff (Oyelowo), a good cop and solid dependable guy, keeps an eye on his teenage niece Ashley (beautifully played by Storm Reid) whose dad is struggling with addiction. One day, Jack gets a panicky call from Ashley, and, rushing over to her house, walks into a crime scene in which everyone is dead. Days later, paralysed by grief, he gets a call from Ashley. She sounds cheery and very much undead. Jack deduces that she is speaking to him from another time period \u2013 two weeks before her murder. Director and co-writer Jacob Estes explains nothing. Has there been some freaky fold in the fabric of time? Is the psychic bond between uncle and niece so strong that not even death can break it? There are some nice Groundhog Day moments as Jack recruits Ashley to help investigate the murders that, in her timeframe, have yet to happen. He begins to alter events in the past, leading to a clammy sense of chaos and time unravelling. But in this end, this contrived concept doesn\u2019t remotely come off. It\u2019s so barmy you half expect Jack to wake up and realise it\u2019s all been a dream, or to be carted off for psychiatric care. There\u2019s not much excitement here, and the whodunnit, when it comes, feels pretty irrelevant. \u2022 Don\u2019t Let Go is released in the UK on 27 September.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI just think I\u2019m damaged, like really damaged,\u201d Jane Couch says quietly as the tears roll down her face. She hunches over and her body shakes. This is the painful cost of being the pioneer of women\u2019s boxing in Britain. Couch was the five-time world champion boxer who was barred from fighting in her own country. Just over 20 years ago the British Boxing Board of Control still insisted women were too emotionally unstable to box.</p> <p>On my way to meet Couch I hear that Katie Taylor, the brilliant Irish boxer, will headline a bill at the Manchester Arena on 2 November with Anthony Crolla. Without Couch\u2019s courage and defiance, Taylor would not be in this position.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/behind-the-lines/2019/sep/05/arthif-daniel-boxing-dentist-professional-boxer-teeth\">The boxing dentist: a fighter who breaks and remakes teeth for a living</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Couch had to win a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/150908.stm\" title=\"\">court case against the sport\u2019s governing body</a> to make British sporting history in August 1998. Bernard Buckley, the board\u2019s solicitor, built his case on the claim that \u201cmany women suffer from premenstrual tension which makes them more emotional and more labile and accident-prone. They are too fragile to box and they bruise easily.\u201d</p> <p>But Couch had shown her mettle to win her first world title in only her fifth fight in 1996. She had flown to Denmark to face Sandra Geiger, the French world champion who came from a kickboxing background. Couch suffered a broken jaw, shattered cheekbone, fractured eye-socket, cracked ribs and a missing tooth but she still won a unanimous decision over 10 rounds. She and Geiger both ended up in hospital.</p> <p>Her world titles and landmark legal victory were of little benefit to Couch. She still struggled to get fights and there were many times when she travelled abroad and, after brutal bouts, was not even paid. At home Couch was shunned by boxing promoters and mocked on television and in the tabloids.</p> <p>I have known Couch since the late 1990s, when I first interviewed her, and she is one of the most admirable and kindest people I\u2019ve met in boxing. She retired 10 years ago but today, as she relives the past trauma, her usual laughter is replaced by grief. When we take a break, because it is so upsetting for her, Couch says simply: \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t been the first. I wish I hadn\u2019t gone through all that shit.\u201d</p> <p>Couch nods when I ask if it\u2019s OK to continue. \u201cI want to,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if I had known what it would cost me I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it. I gave up everything. I didn\u2019t even get into a proper relationship until I was 41. I was my own worst enemy because I\u2019d just argue with [promoters] Frank Maloney and Frank Warren. I\u2019d be like: \u2018I\u2019m not frightened of you. Fuck the pair of you. I\u2019ll fight in France, Germany or America.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The 51-year-old Couch looks up when I say her scars seem more like wounds. \u201cI\u2019m damaged,\u201d she says again. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was but the counsellors and doctors encourage you to talk. They say: \u2018It\u2019s good to get it out. If you hold it in, Jane, you\u2019ll only do more damage.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She wipes her eyes and apologises for crying. Yet her tears are a sign of strength. They show her candour and fight. \u201cI hope so. I just find it hard. It hurts my pride to talk this openly but I don\u2019t think people realise the damage they did. Most of them had never met me and they\u2019d call me a lesbian or a freak.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acb9fd54447b1360505d5160c449b648a0bb573c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acb9fd54447b1360505d5160c449b648a0bb573c/0_0_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Couch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Couch on her way to beating Australia\u2019s Sharon Anyos for the WBF lightweight title in 1999, the year after winning her case against the British Board of Boxing Control.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Gichigi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the heart of Couch\u2019s engaging new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Final-Round-Autobiography-Jane-Couch/dp/1785315625\" title=\"\">The Final Round</a>, she details the legal battle she waged against the boxing board which peddled views of women more suited to the 1890s than the 1990s. Her victory changed sport in this country but Couch shakes her head. \u201cDon\u2019t credit me with women\u2019s boxing. All credit goes to them two women [who represented her]. Sarah Leslie, the solicitor who died of breast cancer at 42, and Dinah Rose, the top sex-discrimination barrister in the country by a mile. We were all young and one of the journalists wrote that we looked like three lesbians. I apologised to Dinah and Sarah because they\u2019re middle-class women. They went: \u2018Jane, it\u2019s terrible.\u2019 I was like: \u2018This isn\u2019t that bad compared to what I\u2019ve been through.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cDinah messed them up because they thought she was going only on sex discrimination. She used that but focused on restraint of trade. I was already a double world champion and the board was stopping me making a living in this country. We won but, when I got the licence, I thought: \u2018It will be all right now.\u2019 The abuse got worse. Dinah knew it would happen. We left the press conference after the court case. She put her arms around me and goes: \u2018I don\u2019t want to tell you this, but your fight\u2019s just beginning.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Couch\u2019s eyes are clear again. \u201cI know what she means now. I\u2019d be on TV shows like Richard and Judy and they would have phone-ins for people to vote. \u2018Is she a freak? Should she be allowed to box?\u2019 When people keep calling you a freak you think, \u2018Maybe I am?\u2019 Three years before I retired I would just sit on my own, crying. I couldn\u2019t see a way out.\u201d</p> <p>A year after she retired, in 2008, Couch had a breakdown. \u201cI was very down. I didn\u2019t want to go out. I was having panic attacks. Other women fighters were sending me messages about their problems. I had pains in my chest like I was having a heart attack.\u201d A friend took Couch to hospital and \u201cthis amazing lady doctor told me I was having a panic attack. I was like: \u2018How can I have a panic attack? I\u2019m not scared of anything.\u2019 I told her what I did and she said: \u2018You\u2019ve got to bury boxing otherwise this will always haunt you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Couch held a private little funeral for her boxing career in a graveyard. She tried to bury it, at least in her head if not the ground below her feet. It was an important symbolic step. \u201cThat night I slept properly for the first time. I started to think differently but it took two years on the [antidepressant] pills. Now I\u2019m getting counselling and I\u2019ve been off the pills for eight months. I\u2019m feeling brilliant.\u201d</p> <p>Writing her book, and talking about it, has been distressing but Couch knows this is the road to lasting peace. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a skilful boxer. I fought with my heart. I learned that in the gym because I had to be tough \u2013 sparring with boys. Those first days in the gym were bad. They\u2019d say: \u2018Fuck off, you\u2019re a girl.\u2019 They laughed at me. They\u2019re all skipping brilliant and I\u2019m tripping over the rope. I could hear them laughing but I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019ll show you.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c43d02306868245e5f729d1bac9c4719f2a19e96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c43d02306868245e5f729d1bac9c4719f2a19e96/0_0_2362_1579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WIBF light welterweight world title holder Jane Couch, pictured in July 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WIBF light welterweight world title holder Jane Couch, pictured in July 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She laughs at her youthful audacity. Before her first world title fight against Geiger she trained for nine months and sparred against well-known male professionals such as Glenn Catley and Dean Francis. \u201cThey were all good with me but they still hit me. They\u2019d be no good to me if they didn\u2019t. They taught me to fight back when you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Geiger was so well-known in France that, as Couch says, \u201cThe president of France [Jacques Chirac] was there when we fought.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI just think I\u2019m damaged, like really damaged,\u201d Jane Couch says quietly as the tears roll down her face. She hunches over and her body shakes. This is the painful cost of being the pioneer of women\u2019s boxing in Britain. Couch was the five-time world champion boxer who was barred from fighting in her own country. Just over 20 years ago the British Boxing Board of Control still insisted women were too emotionally unstable to box. On my way to meet Couch I hear that Katie Taylor, the brilliant Irish boxer, will headline a bill at the Manchester Arena on 2 November with Anthony Crolla. Without Couch\u2019s courage and defiance, Taylor would not be in this position. Couch had to win a court case against the sport\u2019s governing body to make British sporting history in August 1998. Bernard Buckley, the board\u2019s solicitor, built his case on the claim that \u201cmany women suffer from premenstrual tension which makes them more emotional and more labile and accident-prone. They are too fragile to box and they bruise easily.\u201d But Couch had shown her mettle to win her first world title in only her fifth fight in 1996. She had flown to Denmark to face Sandra Geiger, the French world champion who came from a kickboxing background. Couch suffered a broken jaw, shattered cheekbone, fractured eye-socket, cracked ribs and a missing tooth but she still won a unanimous decision over 10 rounds. She and Geiger both ended up in hospital. Her world titles and landmark legal victory were of little benefit to Couch. She still struggled to get fights and there were many times when she travelled abroad and, after brutal bouts, was not even paid. At home Couch was shunned by boxing promoters and mocked on television and in the tabloids. I have known Couch since the late 1990s, when I first interviewed her, and she is one of the most admirable and kindest people I\u2019ve met in boxing. She retired 10 years ago but today, as she relives the past trauma, her usual laughter is replaced by grief. When we take a break, because it is so upsetting for her, Couch says simply: \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t been the first. I wish I hadn\u2019t gone through all that shit.\u201d Couch nods when I ask if it\u2019s OK to continue. \u201cI want to,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if I had known what it would cost me I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it. I gave up everything. I didn\u2019t even get into a proper relationship until I was 41. I was my own worst enemy because I\u2019d just argue with [promoters] Frank Maloney and Frank Warren. I\u2019d be like: \u2018I\u2019m not frightened of you. Fuck the pair of you. I\u2019ll fight in France, Germany or America.\u2019\u201d The 51-year-old Couch looks up when I say her scars seem more like wounds. \u201cI\u2019m damaged,\u201d she says again. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was but the counsellors and doctors encourage you to talk. They say: \u2018It\u2019s good to get it out. If you hold it in, Jane, you\u2019ll only do more damage.\u2019\u201d She wipes her eyes and apologises for crying. Yet her tears are a sign of strength. They show her candour and fight. \u201cI hope so. I just find it hard. It hurts my pride to talk this openly but I don\u2019t think people realise the damage they did. Most of them had never met me and they\u2019d call me a lesbian or a freak.\u201d At the heart of Couch\u2019s engaging new book, The Final Round, she details the legal battle she waged against the boxing board which peddled views of women more suited to the 1890s than the 1990s. Her victory changed sport in this country but Couch shakes her head. \u201cDon\u2019t credit me with women\u2019s boxing. All credit goes to them two women [who represented her]. Sarah Leslie, the solicitor who died of breast cancer at 42, and Dinah Rose, the top sex-discrimination barrister in the country by a mile. We were all young and one of the journalists wrote that we looked like three lesbians. I apologised to Dinah and Sarah because they\u2019re middle-class women. They went: \u2018Jane, it\u2019s terrible.\u2019 I was like: \u2018This isn\u2019t that bad compared to what I\u2019ve been through.\u2019 \u201cDinah messed them up because they thought she was going only on sex discrimination. She used that but focused on restraint of trade. I was already a double world champion and the board was stopping me making a living in this country. We won but, when I got the licence, I thought: \u2018It will be all right now.\u2019 The abuse got worse. Dinah knew it would happen. We left the press conference after the court case. She put her arms around me and goes: \u2018I don\u2019t want to tell you this, but your fight\u2019s just beginning.\u2019\u201d Couch\u2019s eyes are clear again. \u201cI know what she means now. I\u2019d be on TV shows like Richard and Judy and they would have phone-ins for people to vote. \u2018Is she a freak? Should she be allowed to box?\u2019 When people keep calling you a freak you think, \u2018Maybe I am?\u2019 Three years before I retired I would just sit on my own, crying. I couldn\u2019t see a way out.\u201d A year after she retired, in 2008, Couch had a breakdown. \u201cI was very down. I didn\u2019t want to go out. I was having panic attacks. Other women fighters were sending me messages about their problems. I had pains in my chest like I was having a heart attack.\u201d A friend took Couch to hospital and \u201cthis amazing lady doctor told me I was having a panic attack. I was like: \u2018How can I have a panic attack? I\u2019m not scared of anything.\u2019 I told her what I did and she said: \u2018You\u2019ve got to bury boxing otherwise this will always haunt you.\u2019\u201d Couch held a private little funeral for her boxing career in a graveyard. She tried to bury it, at least in her head if not the ground below her feet. It was an important symbolic step. \u201cThat night I slept properly for the first time. I started to think differently but it took two years on the [antidepressant] pills. Now I\u2019m getting counselling and I\u2019ve been off the pills for eight months. I\u2019m feeling brilliant.\u201d Writing her book, and talking about it, has been distressing but Couch knows this is the road to lasting peace. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a skilful boxer. I fought with my heart. I learned that in the gym because I had to be tough \u2013 sparring with boys. Those first days in the gym were bad. They\u2019d say: \u2018Fuck off, you\u2019re a girl.\u2019 They laughed at me. They\u2019re all skipping brilliant and I\u2019m tripping over the rope. I could hear them laughing but I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019ll show you.\u2019\u201d She laughs at her youthful audacity. Before her first world title fight against Geiger she trained for nine months and sparred against well-known male professionals such as Glenn Catley and Dean Francis. \u201cThey were all good with me but they still hit me. They\u2019d be no good to me if they didn\u2019t. They taught me to fight back when you\u2019re hurt.\u201d Geiger was so well-known in France that, as Couch says, \u201cThe president of France [Jacques Chirac] was there when we fought. He gave her the belt but she took a hell of a beating. We both did. I had a metal plate in my cheekbone and I was pissing blood for three weeks after.\u201d Not one line about her becoming world champion was written in the national press or mentioned on radio or television. \u201cI thought I was going to get mobbed at the airport but no one was there. I got Boxing News that next Friday. I was all excited but there was nothing. My manager shrugged. \u2018They don\u2019t do women\u2019s boxing.\u2019 He was as bad as them. A week later he said: \u2018You\u2019ve got a defence in New Orleans.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even want to go back to the gym but I convinced myself.\u201d Couch cleared \u00a3200, after expenses were deducted, for winning the world title. But the New Orleans promoter said he had no money to pay her after she won another hard fight. At least she ended up having Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali\u2019s trainer, and the great former world champion Matthew Saad Muhammad helping in her corner. Couch also talks about the kindness of Marvin Hagler and Lennox Lewis, and her friendships with Frank Bruno and Ricky Hatton. But her love of boxing has soured. \u201cI wasn\u2019t right a few years before I retired. I went on too long. We did the brain scan. They said: \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve had a slight alteration.\u2019 I knew that meant brain damage.

They needed to at least get this out in the open. Trump has overreached a number of times and I think they need to take action.\u201d</p> <p>But Greg Whaley, a businessman from Nebraska who was in Des Moines for an insurance conference, had a different take. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bunch of crap. I think they\u2019re just looking for anything to just try to get Trump in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>A registered Republican, Whaley added: \u201cI think they\u2019ll go through the proceedings and it will hurt them in re-election time.\u201d</p> <p>Next to the Scenic Route Bakery in the East Village, a trendy neighborhood overlooked by the imposing gold dome of the Iowa state capitol building, Chris Costa, a president of a local real estate company, concurred. \u201cThere\u2019s always the risk that for the opposing party it will rally the base of the other side but I think this is going to be a universal situation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think this might be the one potential crime [Trump] has committed that all Americans will jump on board and say that it certainly violated the constitution. It could potentially have an impact on the 2020 election and I think that\u2019s what scares people. I think it\u2019s going to be tough to overcome the evidence that will come forward with the whistleblower complaint. I\u2019m very excited and very happy about it.\u201d</p> <p>At the AC hotel around the corner on Grand Avenue, its popular rooftop bar, The Republic, bustled with businesspeople. Brian Purscell was excited for a different reason. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to the Republicans,\u201d said the businessman and pharmacist who grew up on the south side of Des Moines. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to re-live the Russia thing and what they\u2019re going to find is there\u2019s no \u2018no\u2019 there. It all has to do with the fact that they all hate what Trump\u2019s doing and they just can\u2019t stand it because they\u2019re so diametrically opposed.\u201d</p> <p>Describing himself as an independent who voted Trump in the last election and would do so again, he said: \u201cI believe they\u2019re going to be hoisted by their own petard. The attitude out in the world, if you get past where the centers of elitism is, you get in the flyover country here, things are good. People are happy and they haven\u2019t been for a while.\u201d</p> <p>Across the street, Nick and Alex Meirick sat on the patio outside Ernie\u2019s Boondock, a recently opened dive bar, and reflected on the news while drinking from cans of craft beer.</p> <p>\u201cWhether or not he did anything wrong, I\u2019d like to see them go through the process and investigate it to its full level and see if anything happened,\u201d Nick Meirick said. \u201cMy concern is if there\u2019s any national security threats that it gets taken care of.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Meirick said: \u201cI\u2019m just kinda waiting to see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Kitzman, who works in communications for a local state agency, expressed no such patience. \u201cIt\u2019s about damn time. I can\u2019t believe it took him saying on TV, I did a crime, for the House Democrats to be like, oh, he did a crime. I\u2019m excited that he\u2019s getting impeached but it\u2019s too late, they should have done this years ago.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "News that Democrats have commenced impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump was greeted with mixed reaction in Iowa\u2019s capital, Des Moines. Iowa hosts the first vote in the 2020 fight for the Democratic nomination, and is a likely swing state in next year\u2019s presidential election. Both contests are set to be upended by a long impeachment process, triggered by a scandal over an intelligence service whistleblower complaint alleging the president tried to force Ukraine to help him in his re-election bid. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d said Rebecca Shell, a local bar manager. \u201cI\u2019d like to think it gets him out of office and in jail but he\u2019s slipped through so many different things at the very least I\u2019d hope it prevents him from getting in office in 2020.\u201d Shell\u2019s view was echoed by Cindi Griglione, a paralegal who, like many people in Des Moines, works for an insurance company. \u201cI think it\u2019s about time they started on it and hopefully things will progress as they should,\u201d she said. Outside a Marriott hotel, Daryl Washington, a retirement planner from Chicago in town on business, shared the same sentiment. \u201cI just heard it,\u201d he said, \u201cand my initial thought was what the hell happened to the stock market today, but secondly I thought it needed to be addressed. They needed to at least get this out in the open. Trump has overreached a number of times and I think they need to take action.\u201d But Greg Whaley, a businessman from Nebraska who was in Des Moines for an insurance conference, had a different take. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bunch of crap. I think they\u2019re just looking for anything to just try to get Trump in trouble.\u201d A registered Republican, Whaley added: \u201cI think they\u2019ll go through the proceedings and it will hurt them in re-election time.\u201d Next to the Scenic Route Bakery in the East Village, a trendy neighborhood overlooked by the imposing gold dome of the Iowa state capitol building, Chris Costa, a president of a local real estate company, concurred. \u201cThere\u2019s always the risk that for the opposing party it will rally the base of the other side but I think this is going to be a universal situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this might be the one potential crime [Trump] has committed that all Americans will jump on board and say that it certainly violated the constitution. It could potentially have an impact on the 2020 election and I think that\u2019s what scares people. I think it\u2019s going to be tough to overcome the evidence that will come forward with the whistleblower complaint. I\u2019m very excited and very happy about it.\u201d At the AC hotel around the corner on Grand Avenue, its popular rooftop bar, The Republic, bustled with businesspeople. Brian Purscell was excited for a different reason. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to the Republicans,\u201d said the businessman and pharmacist who grew up on the south side of Des Moines. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to re-live the Russia thing and what they\u2019re going to find is there\u2019s no \u2018no\u2019 there. It all has to do with the fact that they all hate what Trump\u2019s doing and they just can\u2019t stand it because they\u2019re so diametrically opposed.\u201d Describing himself as an independent who voted Trump in the last election and would do so again, he said: \u201cI believe they\u2019re going to be hoisted by their own petard. The attitude out in the world, if you get past where the centers of elitism is, you get in the flyover country here, things are good. People are happy and they haven\u2019t been for a while.\u201d Across the street, Nick and Alex Meirick sat on the patio outside Ernie\u2019s Boondock, a recently opened dive bar, and reflected on the news while drinking from cans of craft beer. \u201cWhether or not he did anything wrong, I\u2019d like to see them go through the process and investigate it to its full level and see if anything happened,\u201d Nick Meirick said. \u201cMy concern is if there\u2019s any national security threats that it gets taken care of.\u201d Alex Meirick said: \u201cI\u2019m just kinda waiting to see what happens.\u201d Mike Kitzman, who works in communications for a local state agency, expressed no such patience. \u201cIt\u2019s about damn time. I can\u2019t believe it took him saying on TV, I did a crime, for the House Democrats to be like, oh, he did a crime. I\u2019m excited that he\u2019s getting impeached but it\u2019s too late, they should have done this years ago.\u201d",

The judge praised McConnell for \u201cproperly and bravely\u201d bringing his case and said there was a \u201cpressing need\u201d for the government and parliament \u201cto address square-on the question of the status of a trans male who has become pregnant and given birth to a child\u201d.

He conceded that \u201cthe social and psychological reality\u201d of McConnell\u2019s relationship with his child was as a father and this was in tension with the law as it stands. In the Netherlands, for example, trans men who give birth are registered as fathers.

      "bodyText": "The attempted murder of Margaret Thatcher by the IRA has been raised by a former prime minister of Ireland as an example of the gravity of the violence that Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for the Irish border could fuel. John Bruton, who was the taoiseach between 1994 and 1997, accused Johnson of seeking to create a \u201cno-man\u2019s land\u201d at the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. \u201cThis is an open invitation to criminal and subversive organisations who have financed themselves in the past by smuggling\u201d, Bruton told MEPs in Brussels. \u201cGiven that one such smuggling-financed criminal organisation attempted to murder one of Mr Johnson\u2019s predecessors as leader of the Conservative party, one would would be forgiven for thinking that he has not studied the history of his party as closely as he should have done.\u201d The IRA attempted to kill Thatcher in a bomb attack at the Grand hotel in Brighton on the first day of the Conservative party conference in 1984. Johnson is due to appear at the Tory conference in Manchester this weekend. The former prime ministers of the UK and Ireland who signed the Good Friday agreement, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, also spoke of their concerns about the destabilising effect of Brexit on peace. Blair said it was \u201ctragic\u201d that tension had also been \u201cinjected\u201d into the relationship between London and Dublin. In a damning critique of the UK government\u2019s policies at a conference in Brussels, Bruton said Johnson\u2019s recent letter to the European council president, Donald Tusk had been highly significant. In the letter, the prime minister spelled out his need for the whole of the UK to be able to diverge from EU standards in order to benefit from Brexit. Bruton said Johnson\u2019s insistence that checks and controls would not be enforced in the event of a no-deal Brexit looked like an attempt to tie the EU into reneging on its duties to protect its borders. \u201cDoes prime minister Johnson want to break up the EU single market? Is that what he really wants?\u201d, the former taoiseach said. \u201cBecause in his letter to his colleagues he said this government would not put in place infrastructure, checks or controls at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland: \u2018We would be happy to accept a legally binding commitment to this effect from the EU and hope that they will offer such a binding commitment\u2019. \u201cHe seems to want the EU to legally bind itself not to enforce its own rules at its own borders. He thus seems to want some sort of no-man\u2019s land in the vicinity of the Irish border where no controls or checks will apply.\u201d Bruton said Northern Ireland\u2019s status was being changed without the consent of its people and that the prime minister had offered \u201cno specific content\u201d that lived up to the obligations of the 1998 Good Friday agreement. Ireland\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Declan Kelleher, told the conference that the current taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had reiterated his government\u2019s position on Monday that the UK proposals so far on the border failed to meet expectations. The UK has said it can agree to a single all-Ireland regulatory zone for trade in agrifood but that there would need to be checks and controls for other goods, with a customs border in place between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Kelleher said: \u201cThe immediate challenge we have is to ensure that the objectives set out in the backstop are reached fully and in all aspects. That\u2019s the approach of the Irish government, the approach the taioseach is taking.

Now all I want him [Johnson] to do is get us a deal and then resign.\u201d</p> \n<p>Outside JK\u2019s steakhouse and cafe bar, leave voter Tony Shaw, 76, and his partner Brenda Green, 70, who voted to remain, are now in agreement. They both feel Johnson\u2019s position has become untenable.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am not impressed,\u201d says Shaw, who was pleased by the judges\u2019 decision. \u201cHe\u2019s tried to overrule the country and stop democracy and that is way out of order. He should not be allowed to get away with this. I voted to leave because I did not like the idea of being ruled by the European Union but what is the point when our own politicians just do what they want and get away with it?\u201d</p> \n<p>But for James Sullivan, 26, who also voted to leave, there has been one delay too many and now there is only one drastic solution.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe politicians obviously can\u2019t seem to get this right. All they seem to think about is tactics. We should be following the examples of Scandinavian countries like Denmark and Norway where the royal families get involved in politics.

The whole country will vote Boris.\u201d</p> \n<p>Balkwill did not accept the supreme court\u2019s ruling. \u201cBoris never broke the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the law courts to decide how the country should be run. The government is there to run the country. The courts should let it get on with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Paul Boyce, 72, a retired railway worker and a leave-supporting Tory, agreed. \u201cI think the law courts have too much power. What\u2019s going to happen now? Is the government going to have to go the courts every time it passes a new law?\u201d</p> \n<p>Kingswood lies three miles east of Bristol city centre, its name originating from the time when it was part of the royal hunting estate. Bristol voted for remain but Kingswood falls within South Gloucestershire, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36597959\">where 53% voted </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36597959\">to leave.</a></p> \n<p>Jake Turner, a 19-year-old worker at the fruit and veg shop in Kings Chase shopping centre, was too young to vote in the EU referendum. He thinks he would have voted leave but if there is a second referendum might plump for remain.</p> \n<p>On Johnson, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s the man for the job but actually I\u2019m not sure who could do that job. I certainly don\u2019t trust Jeremy Corbyn, he scares me. He promises so much but the country wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yvonne Kelly, 51, who runs the flower shop in the shopping centre, was one of the few that thought the court had been right to find against Johnson.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think Boris is arrogant, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in touch with real people and what they want,\u201d she said. \u201cTo turn round and close parliament like he did shows that arrogance. I\u2019m more leaning to Labour at the moment.\u201d <strong>SM</strong></p> \n<h2>Perth \u2013 61% remain</h2> \n<p>Kenneth Sloan was pretty clear that Johnson deserved to lose in the supreme court. \u201cI think Boris wanted to game the system,\u201d Sloan said as he waited outside Primark in central Perth for his wife with their small white dog. \u201cWe\u2019re a parliamentary democracy, and we need to go back to parliament.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sloan, 42, added: \u201cThis talk about how they shouldn\u2019t get involved in the political system: there\u2019s the rule of law, you can\u2019t just do what you please. He said it wasn\u2019t about Brexit in the first place but it clearly was, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t need such a large prorogation.\u201d</p> \n<p>In many respects Perth exemplifies Scotland\u2019s recent political history and its political tensions. Once regarded as a Tory stronghold, it is now represented by Scottish National party MPs and MSPs. In the 2017 snap election, the Conservatives came within 21 votes of beating the veteran SNP MP Pete Wishart in Perth &amp; North Perthshire \u2013 one of the narrowest margins of the election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50a4ac3c6cd2e4ea1118bba313f51fabbca7469a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50a4ac3c6cd2e4ea1118bba313f51fabbca7469a/0_424_5406_3244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kenneth Sloan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kenneth Sloan: \u2018There\u2019s the rule of law, you can\u2019t just do what you please.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Perry/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A day after the supreme court judgment, voters in the city were split over whether the court was right to overrule Johnson: there were furious leave voters and delighted remain voters. </p> \n<p>Douglas Glen, a pro-Brexit businessman and former army officer, said the court\u2019s intervention raised profound questions that could only be resolved by a fresh election. \u201cI think it\u2019s the beginning of a major constitutional crisis in the UK,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Glen was nonplussed by the earlier high court ruling in England that said the prorogation was lawful and dismissive of the three senior Scottish judges in the court of session whose ruling against Johnson was upheld by the supreme court. They were too easily influenced by Scotland\u2019s nationalist devolved government, he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1ad7943d-0570-44fe-820f-f40a46b17537\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>That the court judgment was not about Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is important, once again, to emphasise that these cases are not about when and on what terms the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union. They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the court had the right to act</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That parliament has not been prorogued</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d</p>\n    <p><i>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf\">full judgment</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-summary.pdf\">summary judgment</a> can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIn the future, how on earth will this work if anyone who doesn\u2019t like anything will take it to the supreme court?\u201d Glen asked. \u201cWhat we need is an election. I think the House of Commons has become divorced from the people. People know when they\u2019re being had and the people of this country are being really, really had.\u201d</p> \n<p>A fellow leave voter, Elaine, who declined to give her full name, said the court ruling had shattered her confidence in democracy. \u201cI was disappointed that the judges got involved because they shouldn\u2019t be above parliament. Parliament should be making our decisions, whether they\u2019re right or wrong,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18376cf215823b0ae8df13c794ef91d41d17224f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18376cf215823b0ae8df13c794ef91d41d17224f/0_355_5489_3294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m quite optimistic that it will all come right somehow,\u2019 said student Fern Smith on Perth High Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m quite optimistic that it will all come right somehow,\u2019 said student Fern Smith on Perth High Street.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Perry/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Fern Smith, a 19-year-old student who was too young to vote in the 2016 referendum, said she would vote remain if there was a second vote and backed the supreme court\u2019s decision.

      "bodyText": "Blackpool \u2013 68% leave As flocks of seagulls caw and swoop to retrieve discarded chips and candyfloss, 90-year-old Gloria Maltby takes a moment on a bench near Blackpool\u2019s historic Winter Gardens. The great-grandmother has lived through 18 prime ministers \u2013 the same number as the Queen \u2013 yet none has ever incensed her as much as Boris Johnson. During a brief din from the wailing of the birds, the former factory worker describes her outrage, but above all her deep embarrassment. \u201cHe has brought this country to its knees,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is a liar and not only has he embarrassed the country and the Queen but what he did was illegal. There seems to be one law for Boris and another for everybody else.\u201d Maltby, like many others in the Irish Sea coast resort, voted to leave. In the 2016 referendum it was the most Eurosceptic place in north-west England with 67.5% saying they wanted to leave the EU. Amid reports that the government will seek to lay out a people v parliament campaign in any general election, one of the key questions about the supreme court\u2019s decision that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful is whether voters will conclude that the judges were justified \u2013 or decide that Brexit is being thwarted by an establishment stitch-up. \u201cYes, we voted to leave but we didn\u2019t ask for this mess,\u201d Maltby says. \u201cThis is undemocratic. Now all I want him [Johnson] to do is get us a deal and then resign.\u201d Outside JK\u2019s steakhouse and cafe bar, leave voter Tony Shaw, 76, and his partner Brenda Green, 70, who voted to remain, are now in agreement. They both feel Johnson\u2019s position has become untenable. \u201cI am not impressed,\u201d says Shaw, who was pleased by the judges\u2019 decision. \u201cHe\u2019s tried to overrule the country and stop democracy and that is way out of order. He should not be allowed to get away with this. I voted to leave because I did not like the idea of being ruled by the European Union but what is the point when our own politicians just do what they want and get away with it?\u201d But for James Sullivan, 26, who also voted to leave, there has been one delay too many and now there is only one drastic solution. \u201cThe politicians obviously can\u2019t seem to get this right. All they seem to think about is tactics. We should be following the examples of Scandinavian countries like Denmark and Norway where the royal families get involved in politics. It\u2019s time for the Queen to take charge!\u201d NP South Gloucestershire \u2013 53% leave In Kingswood, South Gloucestershire, 66-year-old Ken Balkwill declared himself a staunch fan of Johnson. \u201cBoris will sort it out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s an election I\u2019ll vote for Boris, my wife will vote for Boris, my son will vote for him. The whole country will vote Boris.\u201d Balkwill did not accept the supreme court\u2019s ruling. \u201cBoris never broke the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the law courts to decide how the country should be run. The government is there to run the country. The courts should let it get on with it.\u201d Paul Boyce, 72, a retired railway worker and a leave-supporting Tory, agreed. \u201cI think the law courts have too much power. What\u2019s going to happen now? Is the government going to have to go the courts every time it passes a new law?\u201d Kingswood lies three miles east of Bristol city centre, its name originating from the time when it was part of the royal hunting estate. Bristol voted for remain but Kingswood falls within South Gloucestershire, where 53% voted to leave. Jake Turner, a 19-year-old worker at the fruit and veg shop in Kings Chase shopping centre, was too young to vote in the EU referendum. He thinks he would have voted leave but if there is a second referendum might plump for remain. On Johnson, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s the man for the job but actually I\u2019m not sure who could do that job. I certainly don\u2019t trust Jeremy Corbyn, he scares me. He promises so much but the country wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.\u201d Yvonne Kelly, 51, who runs the flower shop in the shopping centre, was one of the few that thought the court had been right to find against Johnson. \u201cI think Boris is arrogant, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in touch with real people and what they want,\u201d she said. \u201cTo turn round and close parliament like he did shows that arrogance. I\u2019m more leaning to Labour at the moment.\u201d SM Perth \u2013 61% remain Kenneth Sloan was pretty clear that Johnson deserved to lose in the supreme court. \u201cI think Boris wanted to game the system,\u201d Sloan said as he waited outside Primark in central Perth for his wife with their small white dog. \u201cWe\u2019re a parliamentary democracy, and we need to go back to parliament.\u201d Sloan, 42, added: \u201cThis talk about how they shouldn\u2019t get involved in the political system: there\u2019s the rule of law, you can\u2019t just do what you please. He said it wasn\u2019t about Brexit in the first place but it clearly was, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t need such a large prorogation.\u201d In many respects Perth exemplifies Scotland\u2019s recent political history and its political tensions. Once regarded as a Tory stronghold, it is now represented by Scottish National party MPs and MSPs. In the 2017 snap election, the Conservatives came within 21 votes of beating the veteran SNP MP Pete Wishart in Perth &amp; North Perthshire \u2013 one of the narrowest margins of the election. A day after the supreme court judgment, voters in the city were split over whether the court was right to overrule Johnson: there were furious leave voters and delighted remain voters. Douglas Glen, a pro-Brexit businessman and former army officer, said the court\u2019s intervention raised profound questions that could only be resolved by a fresh election. \u201cI think it\u2019s the beginning of a major constitutional crisis in the UK,\u201d he said. Glen was nonplussed by the earlier high court ruling in England that said the prorogation was lawful and dismissive of the three senior Scottish judges in the court of session whose ruling against Johnson was upheld by the supreme court. They were too easily influenced by Scotland\u2019s nationalist devolved government, he said. \u201cIn the future, how on earth will this work if anyone who doesn\u2019t like anything will take it to the supreme court?\u201d Glen asked. \u201cWhat we need is an election. I think the House of Commons has become divorced from the people. People know when they\u2019re being had and the people of this country are being really, really had.\u201d A fellow leave voter, Elaine, who declined to give her full name, said the court ruling had shattered her confidence in democracy. \u201cI was disappointed that the judges got involved because they shouldn\u2019t be above parliament. Parliament should be making our decisions, whether they\u2019re right or wrong,\u201d she said. Fern Smith, a 19-year-old student who was too young to vote in the 2016 referendum, said she would vote remain if there was a second vote and backed the supreme court\u2019s decision. But since the country had voted leave originally, she said, that should be honoured. \u201cI\u2019m glad that it was ruled out because the rest of parliament didn\u2019t seem happy with it. It felt right that someone outside parliament told him not to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it has definitely been screwed up. I\u2019m quite optimistic that it will all come right somehow. It\u2019s going to happen so we might as well embrace it and hope for the best.\u201d SC",

Matthew (Scott Folan) remains a wan, inscrutable figure who does not account for his actions. This is the story of motherhood at its most tormented. Brenda is a single mother of two boys and a high-powered career woman. Tracy Ann Oberman\u2019s steely eyed performance as Brenda shows her still to be desperate to \u201cfix things\u201d. She is caught between the rock and hard place of seeing Matthew\u2019s actions as those of a rapist and those of a child \u2013 her child. Placey\u2019s rich and multilayered script takes us into tough and rarely visited territory to ask difficult questions: to what degree is the mother of a child-rapist answerable for his actions? Where should Brenda\u2019s allegiances lie? She questions her love for Matthew and speaks of hate. Other hard-edged sentiments are bravely spoken aloud; when she sees the rape victims for the first time she admits: \u201cI resented them.\u201d Her attempts to get answers out of Matthew are met with blankness and while his emotional repression reflects the inability to articulate reason or regret, it is frustrating on a dramatic level. The closest he gets to an explanation is a single, unfinished sentence to Brenda: \u201cYou know I never meant \u2026\u201d There is an occasional sense of emotional distance between actors in the toughest scenes, too, though there are moving moments between Brenda and her youngest son, Jason (Hari Aggarwal) to whom she can still show tenderness without feeling compromised. Matthew\u2019s fate is cleverly foregrounded in the visual symbolism of Lee Newby\u2019s monochrome grey set, which has a Lego-like quality, quickly rearranged from a bedroom to a kitchen to Matthew\u2019s bedroom. It looks like a home while recalling the grey concrete of a prison. Based on a real event and first staged almost a decade ago, Mother of Him is as relevant as ever in its exploration of motherhood and troubled, problematic, porn-fed young masculinity. \u2022 At Park theatre, London, until 26 October.",

      "bodyText": "When the actor, writer and director Gbolahan Obisesan was growing up in Nigeria, his older cousin would tell him stories. \u201cWhether they were Nigerian fables or Aesop\u2019s fables, she would take on the personas of all the characters,\u201d he remembers, \u201cand wrap our imagination in her ability to do that.\u201d Something similar happens in Obisesan\u2019s adaptation of Chigozie Obioma\u2019s Booker-shortlisted novel The Fishermen, an Edinburgh fringe hit for two years running and now at London\u2019s Trafalgar Studios. Obioma\u2019s novel looks at the tragedy one Nigerian family experiences after a chilling, violent prophecy. Obisesan and the director Jack McNamara determined to find the best way to tell \u201cthe journey of these four brothers and what happened to them. We went through different iterations of considering having four brothers, considering having the parents on stage, considering having two brothers and their mother \u2026 Eventually, we decided it needed to be two actors playing all the roles, as a sort of memory play.\u201d Obisesan is now directing another adaptation of a popular novel \u2013 this time, Steve Waters\u2019 version of The Last King of Scotland, based on Giles Foden\u2019s novel, at the Crucible in Sheffield. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky,\u201d he reflects, \u201cbecause books take different forms, and also the story within them. When you\u2019re adapting something, you have to consider whether you\u2019re pursuing a clearly dramatic sort of stage adaptation, for the story to live, or something that feels more in keeping with the artistic choices in the book.\u201d The Last King of Scotland looks at the regime of Ugandan president Idi Amin (played by Tobi Bamtefa) through the eyes of his Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan (played by Daniel Portman). Based loosely on Bob Astles, a British soldier who became a close associate of Amin, Garrigan is ultimately fictional \u2013 but the brutalities of Ugandan life at the time are not. \u201cWherever he is, we see the story of Uganda, the experience of Idi being in power and the spiralling descent of Ugandan social, economic and general stability.\u201d Obisesan worked as a dramaturg with Waters on different versions of the script, and they made the decision to use \u201ca chorus of journalists\u201d who help shine a light \u201con some of the outsider perspectives, as well as tie some of the historical milestones and bullet headings with regards to what\u2019s happening in Uganda, and what various bias newspaper agendas are. Whether it\u2019s a Ugandan press, a British press or an American global press representative, they all have a different understanding of what\u2019s happening, as well as different pressures, and different slants on how to present their information. Hopefully, that comes across as a way to anchor us throughout Idi\u2019s eight-year reign.\u201d Obisesan is a busy man. This year he has already directed Yvette, Urielle Klein-Mekongo\u2019s one-woman gig-theatre show at the Bush in west London, and debbie tucker green\u2019s random, the story of a black schoolboy and how he and his family are touched by knife crime, for Leeds Playhouse. This year also saw SS Mendi: Dancing the Death Drill, a moving ensemble piece that Obisesan adapted last year for South African company Isango Ensemble, visit the Royal Opera House.

I say what I believe all the time,\u201d he said, thrusting a finger in the Guardian\u2019s direction.</p> <p>Walsh then denied he had suggested Obama was born overseas, before almost immediately accepting he had suggested Obama was born overseas. \u201cI was wrong to say that and I\u2019ve apologized for that.\u201d</p> <p>Quite what difference Walsh\u2019s historic racism will make is unclear.

The fact that Business Insider\u2019s Facebook livestream received just 20,000 views is unlikely to change much.</p> <p>Embroiled in a deepening scandal over Ukraine, Trump gave no indication he was watching.

It\u2019s called Uncomfortable Conversations,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s the black guy, I\u2019m the white guy.\u201d It all sounded very noble \u2013 but in his criticism of Trump\u2019s racism, bigotry and small-mindedness Walsh rather glossed over his own record of engaging in all three. As a congressman, and later as a shock-jock radio host, Walsh repeatedly engaged in racism and Islamophobia. He pushed the birther conspiracy theory \u2013 the false claim that Barack Obama was not born in the US \u2013 and as recently as 2017 Walsh was claiming, falsely, that Obama was Muslim. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a racist,\u201d Walsh told MSNBC in August. \u201c[But] I\u2019ve said racist things on Twitter.\u201d In the \u201cspin room\u201d following the debate, Walsh continued his criticism of Trump, saying the president is a \u201cbully and a coward\u201d. When the Guardian asked Walsh if he is a bully and a coward, given his past racism, the congressman disagreed. \u201cNo. I classify myself as somebody who believes in this country, who wants this country to come together and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so outspoken,\u201d Walsh said. When the Guardian asked Walsh if he was a coward when he was peddling Islamophobia and conspiracy theories, he became visibly upset. \u201cNever been a bully or a coward. I say what I believe all the time,\u201d he said, thrusting a finger in the Guardian\u2019s direction. Walsh then denied he had suggested Obama was born overseas, before almost immediately accepting he had suggested Obama was born overseas. \u201cI was wrong to say that and I\u2019ve apologized for that.\u201d Quite what difference Walsh\u2019s historic racism will make is unclear. And quite what purpose the debate served is anyone\u2019s guess. Trump may repulse sections of American voters \u2013 52.1% disapprove of the job he is doing \u2013 but his support among his own party is robust. According to Gallup, 91% of Republicans approve of Trump. That makes it a tall order for anyone trying to convince Republicans to ditch Trump. The fact that Business Insider\u2019s Facebook livestream received just 20,000 views is unlikely to change much. Embroiled in a deepening scandal over Ukraine, Trump gave no indication he was watching. If he was, at least Trump could cling to that one bit of good news: should it come to it, former congressman Joe Walsh won\u2019t have him hanged.",

Women rarely speak, plot or work together, nor even fight or love one another. But our immediate attraction towards a particular kind of feminist impulse will lead us down the wrong avenues when it comes to Tartt, because in fact every one of her women is rich, dangerous and complex. The problem is that they can\u2019t be touched.</p> <p>The great pleasure and privilege of Tartt\u2019s first-person perspective is its all-encompassing immersion; notably, her one book led by a female character, The Little Friend, is told in third person. But part of that immersion involves a wilful blindness to the interiority of women. In a conversation with Camilla in The Secret History, Richard looks \u201cat the side of her face, listening to the sweet, throaty cadences of her voice, when I was jolted from my musing by a sharp exclamation\u201d. It\u2019s almost funny: he\u2019s not <em>listening </em>to her at all! Camilla is an unsatisfying, insubstantial ghost because Richard has no interest in what lies underneath her physical allure; she is \u201cthe real mystery, the safe I could never crack\u201d.</p> <p>Theo Decker is a bit more self-aware. His infatuation for Pippa is \u201cas if \u2013 sick with loneliness for my mother \u2013 I\u2019d imprinted on [Pippa] like some orphaned animal\u201d; romance is more about gaining comfort and safety. He is less self-aware when it comes to his fiancee Kitsey, whom he worries does not have the emotional depths he requires, \u201cso that sometimes I got the disconcerting sensation of wading around in knee-high waters hoping to step into a drop-off, a place deep enough to swim\u201d. A few pages later, when Theo stumbles upon Kitsey in the arms of another man, \u201ctalking quietly, in a low voice husky with emotion\u201d, Tartt shows us a glimpse of her true depth, which Theo can\u2019t see.</p> <p>Resisting the psychological pull of these unreliable narrators allows us glimpses of strange, complicated women Tartt knows down to their bones. Judy is kind and generous even with her parrot voice; she takes care of Richard, offers advice and is revealed in the epilogue to be one of the more successful graduates of their college. Pippa has a life full of trauma that Theo actively avoids thinking about, while Xandra, his apparently ditzy stepmother, is one of the few people in The Goldfinch who knows exactly what he\u2019s doing; she just has no interest in intervening.</p> <p>It\u2019s obviously Tartt\u2019s narrators who are shallow when it comes to the women they meet, not the women themselves. But this means that we never get to wade into those waters either. We watch their turbulent seas from over the clifftop, permitted to glimpse but not to enter. In this context, Harriet becomes less a determined outsider to the ranks of women and more a tragedy waiting to happen, her perspective about to be immolated.</p> <p>At the same time, it is both undeniable and exhausting that if Camilla were the hero of The Secret History or Pippa the star of The Goldfinch, the novels would be very different, because women don\u2019t move in the world the same way men do. Theo stumbles into the world of underground gangsters; Richard spends a winter nearly freezing to death. Their lives aren\u2019t easy, wrestling with trauma, class, loss and grief. But if they were women, there would be an additional layer of disadvantage they would have had to fight through just to tell the story in the first place. Perhaps they would have compensated by becoming \u201chard or quarrelsome\u201d, as Richard worries about Camilla. Tartt\u2019s characters are often working against a very ancient idea of fate, a dark thread set out for them to follow that they cannot divide themselves from. Undoubtedly, her clean, masterful novels would clutter quickly if you added the structural forces of misogyny alongside the divine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/08/the-goldfinch-review-donna-tartt-adaptation-settles-for-silver\">The Goldfinch review \u2013 Donna Tartt adaptation settles for silver</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All the same, sometimes I wonder about the Tartt heroines we could have had.

      "bodyText": "This year\u2019s edition of the avant garde photo art fair Unseen featured 140 exhibitors in total. There were 53 galleries from around the world showcasing artists, including 19 galleries exhibiting for the first time. \u00a9 Maud Chalard &amp; Th\u00e9o Gosselin Beside the main exhibition compound, the fair spread to several venues throughout the town. Promesas de Saliva, from the series Rage of Devotion, by Lisa Ambrosio More than 60 female photographers were on show, and subjects ranged from globalisation and the climate crisis, via abstract and experimental photography, portraiture and body photography, to political and urban landscapes. Skulz, from series The Years of Snake, by Delphone Diallo The main difference between Unseen and other major fairs is its dual nature as both a high-end art photo fair and a contemporary photography festival. Artistic director Marina Paulenka said: \u201cWe want to bridge worlds and erase boundaries between high-end and make it accessible for everyone to appreciate contemporary photography.\u201d Paulenka, a native of Zagreb in Croatia, was on her way to the Venice Biennale in May when the call came through of her appointment by Unseen. She admits to being in tears. One of her first contributions was to bring French artist Tabita Rezaire, whose work is about decolonisation and has observed that today\u2019s internet cables follow the slavery routes of old. Clockwise from top left: Premium Connect; Recaptiulation installation; Sugar Walls Teardom, by Tabita Rezaire, courtesy Goodman Gallery When asked if it was a bit cheeky to showcase an artist who predominantly uses video installation, Paulenka\u2019s answered that photography was constantly evolving and pushing boundaries. Joana Choumali Joana Choumali comes from Ivory Coast, and is exhibited by Gallery 1957 from Accra in Ghana. Her mixed-media photographs, overlaid with embroidered details in vivid colours, are truly a joyous spectacle. Trapped Soul (top), Waves Under My Eyelids and Eleutheria 2, from the series Albahian, by Joana Choumali, courtesy Gallery 1957 Her inspiration for this style came after a long and traumatic illness, during which she taught herself embroidery as a therapeutic exercise. It was the first light of the day whose colour Choumali wanted to capture. Her work will also be exhibited at the V&amp;A museum in London as a part of Prix Pictet 19, which opens on 14 November. Liz Nielsen Liz Nielsen\u2019s abstract landscapes vibrate with colour and layers, each telling a story. The American artist (presented by Black Box Projects) adheres to one of the first experimental photographic techniques: the photogram. She works in complete darkness, save for the occasional use of mobile phone light bounced off the ceiling, to create colours in the most basic ways without lenses. The Meeting, above left, and Pyramid, top, from the Interdimensional Landscapes series (2019); above right: Cosmic Stone Stack, from the series The Arrival (2018) by Liz Nielsen/Black Box Projects The Interdimensional Landscapes series was shot on a road trip in Yellowstone national park in Utah that turned out to be tragic and has a very personal meaning. David Favrod The Ibasho gallery exhibited artist David Favrod, who is of Swiss-Japanese heritage but is currently based in Spain. His work combines manga and anime-style drawings with photography. He usually starts by sketching. Or, in the case of an artwork titled The Fall (La Chute), by digging a hole for a week. Clockwise from top left: The Day of the Fires; Les 4 Cols, from the Sound of the Black Waves series; work-in-progress shots of The Fall; Une Pluie de Sardines \u00a9 David Favrod, courtesy Ibasho As there was a boulder beneath where he began digging, he used Photoshop to make the hole look deeper. After scanning the photograph, and 2,500 hours of Photoshop drawing later, the image was finished. His surreal work A Shower of Sardines, meanwhile, resembles Magritte in a manga style. Mustapha Azeroual At first sight, the work of French-Moroccan light artist Mustapha Azeroual (Galerie Binome) could be taken as being inspired by cubism. His technique involves capturing several images on the same film, transferring them on to a single image, and therefore distorting them in a multistage process of capturing and deconstructing, before merging them again. These untitled works from his series Radiance feature four different locations superimposed into one. Sans titre #0005 (top); Sans titre #1302 and Sans titre #0004, from the series ACTIN, 2019 by Mustapha Azeroual, courtesy Galerie Binome. Jana Sophia Nolle Jana Sophia Nolle\u2019s socially charged series Living Room (Catharine Clark Gallery) places the shelters of some of San Francisco\u2019s homeless into affluent domestic interiors. The intimacy and vulnerability of the shelters is emphasised by the stable structures of the living rooms, with their paintings and bookshelves. It offers a different take on the concept of privacy, and emphasises the value of security, by comparison to the temporary refuge used by the growing number of homeless people in the second richest city in the US. San Francisco, from the series Living Room, by Jana Sophia Nolle, courtesy Catharine Clark Gallery David Uzochukwu Slab, top; Bouyant, left; Uprising, right, both from the series Drown in Magic (2019) by David Uzochukwu, courtesy Galerie Number 8 Twenty-year-old David Uzochukwu (Galerie Number 8), was the youngest artist on show at Unseen this year, and his observations on race and migration are powerful and somewhat disturbing. One photograph, Uprising, involves fish Photoshopped to look like a serpent. He draws inspiration from Greek mythology, but Bleeding Body Near Water is a direct parallel with migrant crossings into Europe. Uzochukwu is of mixed Austrian and Nigerian heritage, and lives in Belgium. His everyday experiences of racial bias permeate his work. HyperFocal by Simon Roberts There were many other artists at Unseen deserving of mention, including Simon Roberts, whose magical forest landscapes could have come straight out of Lord of the Rings ; Charles Xelot, who shows Nenet reindeer herders filling the void of Siberian Arctic; Parisa Aminolahi, whose work deals with homeland, exile and childhood memories; and Xing, an online female collective.

      "body": "<p>Yesterday was a very good day to bury a bad conference. Three weeks ago, rapidly oxidising political genius Dominic Cummings briefed that the Tories were going to \u201cwreck\u201d the Labour party\u2019s annual gathering. After three days in Brighton, it was hard to see how even Downing Street\u2019s Eric Cartman could have done a better job of it than the party themselves. Maybe he could have made Labour go on for an extra day? Or had a few more Dadaist votes on their Brexit position? In the end, Cummings master-strategised himself on to the wrong end of a monster constitutional VAR decision, taking one of his \u201calternative branches of history\u201d right up the jacksy, and delivering Labour the considerable benefit of averting people\u2019s eyes from their unforced errors here.</p> <p>Sixteen hours earlier, Len McCluskey \u2013 who bestrides conference\u2019s jugular like a colossus \u2013 had been telling the TV cameras the party\u2019s shambolic show-of-hands vote on a Brexit position was a democratic triumph. \u201cEverybody\u2019s a winner here today,\u201d the Unite boss beamed. \u201cEverybody.\u201d Oh Len. You should definitely tell that to the people I can still hear screaming \u201cCARD VOTE?!?!?!\u201d \u2013 in vain \u2013 in the hall behind you, having been denied the opportunity to #usepens. At a fringe event later that evening, it was mentioned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/22/failed-watson-plot-exposes-what-really-scares-corbyn-and-his-coterie\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s approval rating is minus 60</a>, the worst for an opposition leader since comparable polling records began. \u201cSo what?\u201d called someone in the audience. Madam, I am sure it is a sublime irrelevance.</p> <p>As usual, this conference featured a number of Labour figures and outriders dismissing the implications of the fact their guy is trailing to a man they consistently recognise as Britain\u2019s leading useless shit. The general line is: \u201cI\u2019d expect Jeremy to put on X number of points in a campaign situation.\u201d Good for you. I\u2019d expect him to already be miles ahead of Boris Johnson, who, in the past three weeks alone, has lost control of Parliament; emitted a primal grunt as one of his MPs defected while he was conducting prime minister\u2019s questions; failed to stop the Commons passing a Brexit extension law; expelled 21 of his own MPs, including two former chancellors and his hero Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson; driven his own brother from the cabinet and politics; whiteyed a policewoman during a speech in which he appeared to have stirred a teaspoon of ketamine into his tea before going on \u2026</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to have to crack open a new paragraph because that one got too long. Continuing with Boris Johnson\u2019s September, then: the prime minister lost another cabinet minister, Amber Rudd, who in effect accused him of lying to the public; continued to be heckled by multiple members of said public every time he went out, including a new father who lambasted him for the state of the NHS outside a neonatal ward; declared himself the Incredible Hulk, only to be humiliated by the prime minister of Luxembourg after refusing to do a joint press conference because some people were shouting at him; it was revealed that a model-entrepreneur-whatever, whose flat he reportedly used to visit between mayoring stints, received \u00a3126,000 of public money; refused to answer questions about any of that; and has now suffered the Supreme Court/jacksy interface. There\u2019s more \u2013 so much more \u2013 but simply not the space.</p> <p>So yes: on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn was able to take to the conference stage to call for the resignation of the above guy. How is that for being born under a lucky sign? At that moment, and really quite by accident, he ended up looking better than Boris Johnson, even though he still delivers speeches with the same mesmeric vim your optician wonders: \u201cAnd is it clearer with this lens \u2026 or without? With \u2026. or without?\u201d Corbyn somehow seems to get worse at it the more of them he does. A bit like Emma Watson in the Harry Potter movies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3c1911d0a2ca55981ed35e097ac4494b80c18f4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c1911d0a2ca55981ed35e097ac4494b80c18f4e/0_39_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratically elected \u2026 Tom Watson outside the conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratically elected \u2026 Tom Watson outside the conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As you do when you have a radical and often interesting policy agenda, conference began with eye-catching, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/22/labour-deputy-row-tom-watson-brighton\" title=\"\">headline-frotting attempts to abolish deputy leader Tom Watson</a>, a man democratically elected by Labour members. Even as the Supreme Court was handing down its judgment on Boris Johnson\u2019s unlawful suspension of Parliament, conference delegates were still being handed leaflets bearing the headline: \u201cSHUN TOM WATSON!\u201d (If you\u2019re not familiar with the joy of sects, a Labour shunning is much like an Amish shunning, except you don\u2019t have to raise a barn afterwards.)</p> <p>Having failed to see Watson off, the Supreme Court news enabled Labour to bump his speech to the Wednesday morning so that Corbyn could speak on the Tuesday instead. Watson promptly tweeted that he would not be speaking at all. So we\u2019ll never know whether Labour\u2019s deputy leader would have been formally shunned. As he put it: \u201cI\u2019ll save the speech I was going to make to conference until next year.\u201d And you can set your watch by that. As long as it\u2019s one of those edible sweet-bracelet watches with a big fizzy face.</p> <p>Day two of conference dawned to news of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/remain-mps-accuse-jeremy-corbyn-shutting-down-brexit-debate\" title=\"\">the pending departure of Andrew Fisher</a>, one of Corbyn\u2019s very closest aides. Fisher\u2019s was a mild sort of resignation, accusing the most senior figures in the party ranks of \u201cclass war\u201d, \u201ca blizzard of lies and excuses\u201d, \u201ca lack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d, and concluding: \u201cI no longer have faith we can succeed.\u201d Only in Labour \u2013 and this genuinely happened \u2013 could Fisher then have had Sunday breakfast with Corbyn and his team in the full view of the conference hotel dining room. I do hope the waiter made the most of it. \u201cWould you like a newspaper with your breakfast, Mr Fisher? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve read the Sunday Times. Ooh, what am I like \u2013 you\u2019ve written half of it. Still, nothing some beans on toast can\u2019t smooth over.\u201d</p> <p>Light moments were in short supply. That said, Emily Thornberry opened her speech with some anecdote about falling off her bike and her life flashing before her eyes, and tapping her nose suggestively about some of the naughty fun she remembered having. Owing to the gesture being misunderstood, Thornberry was forced to clarify her position shortly after her speech, tweeting: \u201cJust for the removal of doubt, I was channelling Kenneth Williams in the Carry On films when I tapped my nose, not Pablo Bloody Escobar!!!\u201d Lol don\u2019t worry, conference \u2013 the shadow foreign secretary isn\u2019t doing her cocaine material, just the sexytime stuff. Hey \u2013 it\u2019s what the Palestinians would have wanted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6dcdaa761f8c0173244e5313250e45e033e13d80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dcdaa761f8c0173244e5313250e45e033e13d80/0_0_3350_2009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nudge, nudge \u2026 Emily Thornberry confuses her audience.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nudge, nudge \u2026 Emily Thornberry confuses her audience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Keir Starmer \u2013 whose expression during Corbyn\u2019s speech might have been that of a man realising he isn\u2019t going to get all of the Infinity Stones in time \u2013 Thornberry was primarily preoccupied with getting conference to adopt a position in which the party would campaign for remain at the next election. The good news is we\u2019ve found the only thing worse than the modern pox of \u201cgender reveal parties\u201d for couples expecting a baby. The bad news is that it\u2019s Labour\u2019s Brexit position reveal party, an event that now seems to have been happening for actual years. We will now have to wait until special one-day conference after the election to find out whether it\u2019s a girl Brexit position or a boy one.</p> <p>Before the big vote, Thornberry likened this moment to the one in Star Wars where the rebels are trapped in the garbage crusher. \u201cYou get the hero standing in the middle,\u201d she explained at one fringe event, \u201cand the walls are coming in.\u201d Please don\u2019t tell me that Jeremy Corbyn is Han Solo in this \u2013 but go on. \u201cThe answer is not to just stand there and go: \u2018Oh well, I\u2019m right,\u2019\u201d explained Thornberry. \u201cThe answer is to get out of there.\u201d Well, actually \u2026 technically, the answer is to get R2-D2 to disable all the trash compactors on the detention level of the Death Star. Or, I guess, get another R2 unit to disable the Labour powerbrokers who reckon it is better to achieve a show of loyalty to Corbyn than a Brexit position that doesn\u2019t fill with dread the person who has to ring a civilian doorbell and explain it.</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid no such R2 unit emerged. And for all the fire cover afforded by the Worst Government In History\u2122, what happened here in Brighton still happened. Whenever the next election comes \u2013 possibly in about 15 minutes \u2013 Labour will go into it with a Brexit policy that we already know makes every shadow minister who says it on TV sound like a stone-cold dick. And which goes viral \u2013 in an avian flu sort of way \u2013 every time one of them attempts it. We will come to the farcical voting scenes via which it was arrived at shortly. In the meantime, it is to be hoped that Labour will soon vote, ideally via a show of hands, to convene a special conference to decide how badly they messed this one up.</p> <p>Do people notice? There is a classic Victoria Wood mockumentary on the making of Acorn Antiques, her brilliant parodic soap opera set in an antique shop. A series of entirely self-induced setbacks mean cast and crew have run out of time, and have to shoot an episode that will go out live. Backstage at one point during the broadcast, tea lady Mrs Overall is so taken up with a humblebrag anecdote that she misses her cue, and enters the scene without her crucial tea tray. Given most of the lines relate to the contents of that tray, she and the other characters are forced to mime holding one in the ensuing discussion about the various items on it. Clearly, it\u2019s a disastrous and avoidable shambles, and there\u2019s panic in the director\u2019s gallery. \u201cShall we cut? Go back?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d drawls the monstrous show producer with a smile. \u201cWe professionals notice. Joe Public never clocks a damn thing.\u201d</p> <p>This high-handed insouciance is the preferred get-out at Labour conference, where needless rows and unprofessionalism are blithely assumed not to cut through. I spoke to figures from the top of the party downward telling me \u2013 and perhaps themselves \u2013 that the public doesn\u2019t pay attention to the plotting and walkouts and so on. But guys \u2026 that still doesn\u2019t mean you should do it?</p> <p>Joe Public does occasionally clock things that appear on the main news bulletins, however, and the decision to screen clips of Labour\u2019s handling of the back-remain-now motion means it might dimly have penetrated the consciousness of those dim remainers. It really was some special telly.</p> <p>By way of a curtain-raiser, John McDonnell had conceded: \u201cThere will be a bit of banter.\u201d In the event, there was bantergeddon (superseded 16 hours later by the Supreme Court banterpocalypse). After a closely run show of hands, this was the precise dialogue from the platform featuring the chair, Wendy Nichols, and Labour\u2019s general secretary Jennie Formby:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b3a0ab5c4c1b589505f1c8cb4fe532d05bcb28b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b3a0ab5c4c1b589505f1c8cb4fe532d05bcb28b/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A show of hands \u2026 Labour remain campaigners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A show of hands \u2026 Labour remain campaigners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nichols: \u201cSorry, I thought it was one way, and Jennie said something else, so \u2026\u201d [clamour from the floor]</p> <p>Formby: \u201cIt is lost.\u201d</p> <p>Nichols: Yeah \u2026 that was lost.\u201d [cheers/uproar]</p> <p>Nichols: [to Formby] They\u2019re calling for a card vote.

I\u2019m not sure of the wisdom of bringing this democracy masterclass to a wider TV audience. At the best of times the rules and processes of Labour conference appear entirely impenetrable to outsiders.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday was a very good day to bury a bad conference. Three weeks ago, rapidly oxidising political genius Dominic Cummings briefed that the Tories were going to \u201cwreck\u201d the Labour party\u2019s annual gathering. After three days in Brighton, it was hard to see how even Downing Street\u2019s Eric Cartman could have done a better job of it than the party themselves. Maybe he could have made Labour go on for an extra day? Or had a few more Dadaist votes on their Brexit position? In the end, Cummings master-strategised himself on to the wrong end of a monster constitutional VAR decision, taking one of his \u201calternative branches of history\u201d right up the jacksy, and delivering Labour the considerable benefit of averting people\u2019s eyes from their unforced errors here. Sixteen hours earlier, Len McCluskey \u2013 who bestrides conference\u2019s jugular like a colossus \u2013 had been telling the TV cameras the party\u2019s shambolic show-of-hands vote on a Brexit position was a democratic triumph. \u201cEverybody\u2019s a winner here today,\u201d the Unite boss beamed. \u201cEverybody.\u201d Oh Len. You should definitely tell that to the people I can still hear screaming \u201cCARD VOTE?!?!?!\u201d \u2013 in vain \u2013 in the hall behind you, having been denied the opportunity to #usepens. At a fringe event later that evening, it was mentioned that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s approval rating is minus 60, the worst for an opposition leader since comparable polling records began. \u201cSo what?\u201d called someone in the audience. Madam, I am sure it is a sublime irrelevance. As usual, this conference featured a number of Labour figures and outriders dismissing the implications of the fact their guy is trailing to a man they consistently recognise as Britain\u2019s leading useless shit. The general line is: \u201cI\u2019d expect Jeremy to put on X number of points in a campaign situation.\u201d Good for you. I\u2019d expect him to already be miles ahead of Boris Johnson, who, in the past three weeks alone, has lost control of Parliament; emitted a primal grunt as one of his MPs defected while he was conducting prime minister\u2019s questions; failed to stop the Commons passing a Brexit extension law; expelled 21 of his own MPs, including two former chancellors and his hero Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson; driven his own brother from the cabinet and politics; whiteyed a policewoman during a speech in which he appeared to have stirred a teaspoon of ketamine into his tea before going on \u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to have to crack open a new paragraph because that one got too long. Continuing with Boris Johnson\u2019s September, then: the prime minister lost another cabinet minister, Amber Rudd, who in effect accused him of lying to the public; continued to be heckled by multiple members of said public every time he went out, including a new father who lambasted him for the state of the NHS outside a neonatal ward; declared himself the Incredible Hulk, only to be humiliated by the prime minister of Luxembourg after refusing to do a joint press conference because some people were shouting at him; it was revealed that a model-entrepreneur-whatever, whose flat he reportedly used to visit between mayoring stints, received \u00a3126,000 of public money; refused to answer questions about any of that; and has now suffered the Supreme Court/jacksy interface. There\u2019s more \u2013 so much more \u2013 but simply not the space. So yes: on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn was able to take to the conference stage to call for the resignation of the above guy. How is that for being born under a lucky sign? At that moment, and really quite by accident, he ended up looking better than Boris Johnson, even though he still delivers speeches with the same mesmeric vim your optician wonders: \u201cAnd is it clearer with this lens \u2026 or without? With \u2026. or without?\u201d Corbyn somehow seems to get worse at it the more of them he does. A bit like Emma Watson in the Harry Potter movies. As you do when you have a radical and often interesting policy agenda, conference began with eye-catching, headline-frotting attempts to abolish deputy leader Tom Watson, a man democratically elected by Labour members. Even as the Supreme Court was handing down its judgment on Boris Johnson\u2019s unlawful suspension of Parliament, conference delegates were still being handed leaflets bearing the headline: \u201cSHUN TOM WATSON!\u201d (If you\u2019re not familiar with the joy of sects, a Labour shunning is much like an Amish shunning, except you don\u2019t have to raise a barn afterwards.) Having failed to see Watson off, the Supreme Court news enabled Labour to bump his speech to the Wednesday morning so that Corbyn could speak on the Tuesday instead. Watson promptly tweeted that he would not be speaking at all. So we\u2019ll never know whether Labour\u2019s deputy leader would have been formally shunned. As he put it: \u201cI\u2019ll save the speech I was going to make to conference until next year.\u201d And you can set your watch by that. As long as it\u2019s one of those edible sweet-bracelet watches with a big fizzy face. Day two of conference dawned to news of the pending departure of Andrew Fisher, one of Corbyn\u2019s very closest aides. Fisher\u2019s was a mild sort of resignation, accusing the most senior figures in the party ranks of \u201cclass war\u201d, \u201ca blizzard of lies and excuses\u201d, \u201ca lack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d, and concluding: \u201cI no longer have faith we can succeed.\u201d Only in Labour \u2013 and this genuinely happened \u2013 could Fisher then have had Sunday breakfast with Corbyn and his team in the full view of the conference hotel dining room. I do hope the waiter made the most of it. \u201cWould you like a newspaper with your breakfast, Mr Fisher? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve read the Sunday Times. Ooh, what am I like \u2013 you\u2019ve written half of it. Still, nothing some beans on toast can\u2019t smooth over.\u201d Light moments were in short supply. That said, Emily Thornberry opened her speech with some anecdote about falling off her bike and her life flashing before her eyes, and tapping her nose suggestively about some of the naughty fun she remembered having. Owing to the gesture being misunderstood, Thornberry was forced to clarify her position shortly after her speech, tweeting: \u201cJust for the removal of doubt, I was channelling Kenneth Williams in the Carry On films when I tapped my nose, not Pablo Bloody Escobar!!!\u201d Lol don\u2019t worry, conference \u2013 the shadow foreign secretary isn\u2019t doing her cocaine material, just the sexytime stuff. Hey \u2013 it\u2019s what the Palestinians would have wanted. Like Keir Starmer \u2013 whose expression during Corbyn\u2019s speech might have been that of a man realising he isn\u2019t going to get all of the Infinity Stones in time \u2013 Thornberry was primarily preoccupied with getting conference to adopt a position in which the party would campaign for remain at the next election. The good news is we\u2019ve found the only thing worse than the modern pox of \u201cgender reveal parties\u201d for couples expecting a baby. The bad news is that it\u2019s Labour\u2019s Brexit position reveal party, an event that now seems to have been happening for actual years. We will now have to wait until special one-day conference after the election to find out whether it\u2019s a girl Brexit position or a boy one. Before the big vote, Thornberry likened this moment to the one in Star Wars where the rebels are trapped in the garbage crusher. \u201cYou get the hero standing in the middle,\u201d she explained at one fringe event, \u201cand the walls are coming in.\u201d Please don\u2019t tell me that Jeremy Corbyn is Han Solo in this \u2013 but go on. \u201cThe answer is not to just stand there and go: \u2018Oh well, I\u2019m right,\u2019\u201d explained Thornberry. \u201cThe answer is to get out of there.\u201d Well, actually \u2026 technically, the answer is to get R2-D2 to disable all the trash compactors on the detention level of the Death Star. Or, I guess, get another R2 unit to disable the Labour powerbrokers who reckon it is better to achieve a show of loyalty to Corbyn than a Brexit position that doesn\u2019t fill with dread the person who has to ring a civilian doorbell and explain it. I\u2019m afraid no such R2 unit emerged. And for all the fire cover afforded by the Worst Government In History\u2122, what happened here in Brighton still happened. Whenever the next election comes \u2013 possibly in about 15 minutes \u2013 Labour will go into it with a Brexit policy that we already know makes every shadow minister who says it on TV sound like a stone-cold dick. And which goes viral \u2013 in an avian flu sort of way \u2013 every time one of them attempts it. We will come to the farcical voting scenes via which it was arrived at shortly. In the meantime, it is to be hoped that Labour will soon vote, ideally via a show of hands, to convene a special conference to decide how badly they messed this one up. Do people notice? There is a classic Victoria Wood mockumentary on the making of Acorn Antiques, her brilliant parodic soap opera set in an antique shop. A series of entirely self-induced setbacks mean cast and crew have run out of time, and have to shoot an episode that will go out live. Backstage at one point during the broadcast, tea lady Mrs Overall is so taken up with a humblebrag anecdote that she misses her cue, and enters the scene without her crucial tea tray. Given most of the lines relate to the contents of that tray, she and the other characters are forced to mime holding one in the ensuing discussion about the various items on it. Clearly, it\u2019s a disastrous and avoidable shambles, and there\u2019s panic in the director\u2019s gallery. \u201cShall we cut? Go back?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d drawls the monstrous show producer with a smile. \u201cWe professionals notice. Joe Public never clocks a damn thing.\u201d This high-handed insouciance is the preferred get-out at Labour conference, where needless rows and unprofessionalism are blithely assumed not to cut through. I spoke to figures from the top of the party downward telling me \u2013 and perhaps themselves \u2013 that the public doesn\u2019t pay attention to the plotting and walkouts and so on. But guys \u2026 that still doesn\u2019t mean you should do it? Joe Public does occasionally clock things that appear on the main news bulletins, however, and the decision to screen clips of Labour\u2019s handling of the back-remain-now motion means it might dimly have penetrated the consciousness of those dim remainers. It really was some special telly. By way of a curtain-raiser, John McDonnell had conceded: \u201cThere will be a bit of banter.\u201d In the event, there was bantergeddon (superseded 16 hours later by the Supreme Court banterpocalypse). After a closely run show of hands, this was the precise dialogue from the platform featuring the chair, Wendy Nichols, and Labour\u2019s general secretary Jennie Formby: Nichols: \u201cSorry, I thought it was one way, and Jennie said something else, so \u2026\u201d [clamour from the floor] Formby: \u201cIt is lost.\u201d Nichols: Yeah \u2026 that was lost.\u201d [cheers/uproar] Nichols: [to Formby] They\u2019re calling for a card vote. It\u2019s obviously a card vote. There\u2019s enough of them on their feet.\u201d [clamour/uproar, the \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn chant\u201d] Nichols: \u201cIn my view it was carried.\u201d Formby: \u201cIt was lost. It was lost.\u201d Formby: [inaudible] Nichols: \u201cSorry. Sorry. I\u2019m getting advice. It was lost.\u201d So there you go. I\u2019m not sure of the wisdom of bringing this democracy masterclass to a wider TV audience. At the best of times the rules and processes of Labour conference appear entirely impenetrable to outsiders. Composites, cancelled NEC meetings, late-night stitch-ups \u2026 What happens in the hall and beyond is partly The Glass Bead Game, the elaborate and rarefied pastime in Herman Hesse\u2019s novel, whose intricacies and opacities take a lifetime to master. But it is also partly Boar on the Floor, a bonding parlour game featured in a recent Succession episode about a corporate hunting trip, which sees participants forced to crawl around the floor of a Hungarian lodge and fight for sausages, willingly or otherwise, in a game that had zero rules beyond the bullying whim of the terrifying paterfamilias. Sorry, I know we\u2019ve already mentioned everyone\u2019s favourite self-appointed Boar Master, Len McCluskey. The upshot of Brighton is that Labour have once again done well out of events beyond their control. Events within their control, not so much.

      "bodyText": "An opposition leader in Rwanda has said the murder this week of a senior official in her party was an attempt to intimidate those trying to enter politics to challenge the veteran president, Paul Kagame. Sylidio Dusabumuremyi, the national coordinator of the FDU-Inkingi party, was stabbed to death at his workplace, a canteen at a health centre in southern Rwanda, by two unidentified attackers who arrived by motorbike. Victoire Ingabire, the party\u2019s leader, said Monday\u2019s attack was aimed at preventing her party from winning official recognition. \u201cThey want to prevent me from creating an opposition party \u2026 This killing has no other implications other than intimidating Rwandans from participating in politics of their country,\u201d she said. Kagame won a landslide victory in 2017 elections, securing a third term in office with 99% of the vote. The 61-year-old has garnered international praise for the stability and economic development he has achieved in Rwanda since the 1994 genocide, when an estimated 800,000 people were killed, but he has also been accused of running an authoritarian, one-party state. Authorities in Rwanda said they were investigating the attack and two people had been arrested. \u201cInvestigations continue to arrest other suspects and establish the motive behind the murder,\u201d the Rwanda investigation bureau said in a statement on social media. The murder was the latest in a series of attacks that have targeted opposition figures inside and outside Rwanda. Amnesty International said the killing of Dusabumuremyi followed numerous suspicious attacks and was \u201cextremely alarming\u201d. Ingabire, 50, returned to Rwanda to launch an opposition political movement in 2010 after 16 years exile in the Netherlands, but was jailed before she could contest the election. She then served much of a 15-year sentence on terrorism charges, which she says were politically motivated. Speaking to reporters in Kigali as she arrived at a hearing in the case of nine other people from her party who face terrorism-related charges, Ingabire called on security services to \u201cdo something about those killings and protect the opposition members as all Rwandans\u201d. Dusabumuremyi was at least the second of Ingabire\u2019s aides to be killed this year. On 15 July 2019, Eug\u00e8ne Ndereyimana, another member of FDU-Inkingi, was reported missing by his colleagues when he failed to show up for a meeting in Nyagatare in Rwanda\u2019s Eastern province, and in March the body of Ingabire\u2019s spokesman was found on the edge of the Gishwati forest in March after he disappeared while travelling to visit his parents. Last year Boniface Twagirimana, FDU-Inkingi\u2019s vice-president, was reported to have escaped from Mpanga prison, a maximum-security jail in the southern Nyanza district, but has not been seen since. Human rights campaigners say the circumstances of his alleged escape suggest he may have been abducted and killed. Kagame\u2019s government came under international scrutiny in 2014 when the president\u2019s former spy chief Patrick Karegeya was found strangled in a luxury hotel in Johannesburg on New Year\u2019s Day. Karegeya took charge of Rwanda\u2019s foreign intelligence services for a decade, until he fell into disgrace. He was jailed twice, in 2005 and 2006. South African prosecutors said they found \u201cclose links\u201d between the murder suspects and Kagame\u2019s government. Rwanda has always denied the allegations. South Africa has asked Rwanda to extradite two men suspected of murdering Karegeya, in a move likely to sour relations between the two countries. Kagame forcefully denied any human rights abuses in Rwanda earlier this year, calling criticism \u201cabsolute rubbish\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d. \u201cYou [in Europe] really need to stop this superiority complex nonsense about human rights,\u201d Kagame told France24. \u201cYou think you\u2019re the only ones who respect human rights, and all others it\u2019s about violating human rights. No, we have fought for human rights and freedoms of our people much better, and more than anyone including you people who keep talking about this nonsense.\u201d In September last year, 2,000 prisoners were released, including Ingabire. Human rights organisations welcomed this, saying it showed that \u201cRwanda may be turning a new leaf\u201d, but said the arrests, executions, disappearances and torture would have to end to prove that the change was meaningful. Despite some discontent over unemployment and other domestic issues, and a controversial reputation overseas, Kagame appears to be genuinely popular in Rwanda. Some observers have questioned the reliability of the economic statistics showing growth. Others allege that increasing cronyism could undermine economic progress.",

The problem, however, is that when the world of opera is confronted with an expanse of sand, its instinct is to bury its head in it.</p> <p>From the moment the allegations against Domingo from women at the Los Angeles and Washington operas first erupted in public in August, it was clear that the 78-year-old\u2019s performances this month at the New York Met, where he has performed since 1968, should have been put on ice. The allegations, which Domingo denies, often in very dignified language, were serious. The Met must have known that the singer\u2019s next US performances \u2013 in Verdi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.metopera.org/season/2019-20-season/macbeth/\">Macbeth</a> at the Met starting this week \u2013 could not go ahead in such an atmosphere.</p> <p>And yet, the Met allowed the issue to remain unresolved until the very eve of its 2019-20 season today. Domingo remained scheduled to open the season. He came to New York and took part in rehearsals, including last Saturday\u2019s dress rehearsal.

      "bodyText": "Placido Domingo\u2019s total withdrawal from the Metropolitan Opera in the wake of continuing sexual harassment allegations against him ought to mark a line in the sand for the operatic world. The problem, however, is that when the world of opera is confronted with an expanse of sand, its instinct is to bury its head in it. From the moment the allegations against Domingo from women at the Los Angeles and Washington operas first erupted in public in August, it was clear that the 78-year-old\u2019s performances this month at the New York Met, where he has performed since 1968, should have been put on ice. The allegations, which Domingo denies, often in very dignified language, were serious. The Met must have known that the singer\u2019s next US performances \u2013 in Verdi\u2019s Macbeth at the Met starting this week \u2013 could not go ahead in such an atmosphere. And yet, the Met allowed the issue to remain unresolved until the very eve of its 2019-20 season today. Domingo remained scheduled to open the season. He came to New York and took part in rehearsals, including last Saturday\u2019s dress rehearsal. It appears that it was only since Saturday that the issue of Domingo\u2019s participation finally came to its inevitable head and resulted in its predictable conclusion. Meetings \u2013 some of them described as heated \u2013 between staff and the Met\u2019s general manager Peter Gelb are said to have forced the issue. At the 11th hour, the company issued a statement saying: \u201cThe Met and Mr Domingo are in agreement that he needed to step down.\u201d Where do this week\u2019s developments leave the Royal Opera House in London? Domingo is just as much of a favourite performer at Covent Garden as he is at the Met. He has been appearing there since 1971 and he is scheduled to return next summer in Verdi\u2019s Don Carlo.

      "bodyText": "Ben Elton\u2019s sitcom Upstart Crow, which imagines the beleaguered personal and professional lives of a floridly loquacious William Shakespeare, is to be adapted for the stage. It will provide David Mitchell, who has played the lead role in three series for the BBC, with his West End theatre debut. Gemma Whelan will resume her role as Kate, the shrewd daughter of Shakespeare\u2019s landlord, in the new play. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to have the opportunity to bring history\u2019s most famous balding dramatist to the West End,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cTheatregoers can look forward to a comedy steeped in authentic Shakespearean ambience in every way apart from the smell.\u201d Elton, who wrote the original series with Mitchell in mind, has set the play in 1605, with Shakespeare desperately searching for a new plot, distracted by family troubles and no doubt coming up with a tortured metaphor or two. The comedy promises confusion caused by a pair of identical twins and a dancing bear named Mrs Whiskers that has escaped from the Globe. Several plays have featured the great Stratford dramatist as a character, most notably Edward Bond\u2019s Bingo and the 2014 stage adaptation of the Oscar-winning film Shakespeare in Love. Shakespeare also had a minor role in Emilia, Morgan Lloyd Malcolm\u2019s rousing portrait of Emilia Bassano, the supposed dark lady of his sonnets, which was a West End hit. Directed by Sean Foley, The Upstart Crow opens at the Gielgud theatre, London, on 7 February, and will run for 11 weeks.",

      "bodyText": "A global initiative to measure the extent of mental illness around the world and identify some of the most effective treatments is unveiled in New York on Wednesday. The Countdown Global Mental Health 2030 project is aimed at improving the sketchy data for illnesses like depression and anxiety, and establishing proper metrics so that countries can be compared with one another. A scorecard will be produced every two years, so that the best performing countries can be held up as examples to the rest. The broad aim is to pinpoint successes and failures in treatment and encourage states \u2013 and donors \u2013 to invest in what works best to deal with illnesses that afflict hundreds of millions of people. \u201cWhen it comes to mental health, all countries are developing countries,\u201d said Shekhar Saxena, a Harvard professor who is leading the project in conjunction with the World Health Organization, the Lancet and other civil society NGOs. \u201cThere will be comparisons across countries and across time,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to measure how much progress we have made, and establish how we allocate resources.\u201d The problem is that information on the mental health of nations is patchy, unreliable and hard to compare from one country to the next, making it difficult to set targets. There are no blood tests or X-rays that identify these types of illnesses, and much of the data rests on self-reporting or extrapolation of surveys. A tracker measuring the deleterious effect of disease on society \u2013 the global burden of disease \u2013 has operated since 1990, but its mental health component is shot through with uncertainty. Some countries have relatively robust assessment approaches, including doctor surveys and cohort studies. But many poorer countries do not. Additionally, the WHO collects information on services available in each country \u2013 the Mental Health Atlas \u2013 but here there are also big gaps. D\u00e9vora Kestel, the WHO director of mental health and substance abuse, says the aim is a \u201cmore real mapping of the situation\u201d. \u201cI am convinced that many countries are not even aware of the mental health burden in their population. So we need a stronger argument. If they do things that are doable in terms of funding they will be able to improve the mental health of the population \u2013 and also the economy of the country.\u201d The countdown metric is being unveiled at the \u201cGoalkeepers\u201d summit on the sidelines of the UN general assembly. Kestel said that if mental health needs were more accurately pinpointed it would help donors make more judicious investments to improve global mental health outcomes. Victor Ugo, a Nigerian who set up a mental health self-help group in Nigeria because of the lack of services and treatments, said a clearer picture of the prevalence of illness \u2013 and the shortcomings of treatment \u2013 could spur the authorities into better responses. \u201cThis will mean that we can see where we are \u2013 with data, policies and programmes and funding within the African states. That will help us demand better accountability and better systems.\u201d This article is part of a six-month global series on mental health.

      "bodyText": "Days after her powerful speech to the UN climate action summit reverberated around the world, Greta Thunberg has been named among four winners of an international award dubbed the \u201calternative Nobels\u201d. The Swedish activist, whose emotional address accusing world leaders of betraying her generation went viral this week, was recognised by the judges of Sweden\u2019s annual Rights Livelihood awards for \u201cinspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts\u201d. Honoured alongside Thunberg were Guo Jianmei, the leading Chinese lawyer and women\u2019s rights advocate, \u201cfor her pioneering and persistent work in securing women\u2019s rights in China\u201d, and Aminatou Haidar from western Sahara, whose \u201cdignity and resolve\u201d in campaigning for the independence of her homeland drew praise from the judges. Indigenous leader Davi Kopenawa, a spokesperson for the Yanomami people, who live in an area of the Amazon rainforest on the Brazil-Venezuela border, completed the four-strong list of laureates. Kopenawa was jointly recognised with the Hutukara Yanomami Association, which conserves the rainforest and campaigns for indigenous rights, in Brazil. The Right Livelihood awards began in 1980 after the Nobel foundation rejected a proposal for two new prizes for work on the environment and within developing countries. Previous winners include Edward Snowden, Wangari Maathai and Alan Rusbridger. \u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful for being one of the recipients of this great honour,\u201d said Thunberg, in New York for the UN general assembly. \u201cBut of course, it is not me who is the winner. I am part of a global movement of school children, youth and adults of all ages who have decided to act in defence of our living planet. I share this award with them.\u201d Thunberg and her fellow laureates will each receive 1m Swedish krona (\u00a383,000) to further their work in addition to long-term support that includes help and protection for those \u201cwhose lives and liberty are in danger\u201d. Announcing the laureates in Stockholm, Ole von Uexkull, executive director of the Right Livelihood Foundation, said: \u201cWith the 2019 Right Livelihood award, we honour four practical visionaries whose leadership has empowered millions of people to defend their inalienable rights and to strive for a liveable future for all on planet Earth.\u201d Jianmei, who has been hailed as China\u2019s \u201cpatron of the weak\u201d and has helped thousands of disadvantaged women to access justice , has faced sustained pressure in her efforts to support those affected by domestic violence. Jianmei said: \u201cThis award recognises and acknowledges the efforts of my team and me to uphold women\u2019s rights and promote democracy and the rule of law in China, under difficult circumstances, for the past 25 years. Currently, pro bono legal work in China is facing enormous challenges. To stand firm, we will need more passion, courage, perseverance and commitment. This award serves as an encouragement and motivation.\u201d Human rights defender Haidar, affectionately known as the \u201cSahrawi Gandhi\u201d, was recognised for \u201cher steadfast nonviolent action, despite imprisonment and torture, in pursuit of justice and self-determination for the people of western Sahara\u201d. Haidar said: \u201cThis is a recognition of my nonviolent struggle and the just cause of the Sahrawi people. Despite military occupation and violations of fundamental human rights, they continue their peaceful struggle. The Sahrawis deserve to be supported by all so that, one day, they will achieve independence and freedom.\u201d Kopenawa and the Hutukara Yanomami Association \u2013 of which he is president and co-founder \u2013 were hailed \u201cfor their courageous determination to protect the forests and biodiversity of the Amazon, and the lands and culture of its indigenous peoples\u201d. Dubbed the Dalai Lama of the Rainforest, Kopenawa has dedicated his life to advocating for Yanomami rights, culture and lands in the Amazon. Kopenawa, who wrote The Falling Sky, the first book by a Yanomami, said the award came \u201cjust at the right time\u201d and marked \u201ca show of trust in me and Hutukara and all those who defend the forest and planet Earth\u201d. He said: \u201cThe award gives me the strength to continue the fight to defend the soul of the Amazon forest. We, the peoples of the planet, need to preserve our cultural heritage as Omame [the Creator] taught \u2013 to live well caring for our land so that future generations continue to use it.\u201d The winners will receive their prizes in a ceremony in Stockholm on 4 December.",

Yet, as memorable experiences go, this no-longer-quite-so-secret bunker is hard to beat. \u2022 secretbunker.co.uk",

The partnership, signed on Wednesday, is an attempt by Rio Tinto to curb its \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions \u2013 those made by its customers \u2013 and follows a pledge in July by its rival, BHP, to spend $400m as part of a plan to tackle the climate crisis. It comes despite a campaign by the Morrison government to get big business to shut up about social issues such as the environment and restrict its campaigns to economic territory including corporate tax cuts. Coal-burning steel mills are a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions, creating about 1.8 tonnes of carbon emissions per tonne of steel and accounting for between 7% and 9% of the global total. It is possible to slash emissions by substituting hydrogen that has been manufactured using renewable energy for metallurgical coal, but the technology is not yet in commercial use. However, it is understood the partnership between Rio Tinto and China Baowu, which also includes Tsinghua University, will also look at emissions from shipping. Shipping represents low-hanging fruit for companies looking to improve their environmental credentials because emissions can be quickly reduced by changing from ships using bunker fuel \u2013 heavy, carbon-intensive oil \u2013 to natural gas. The China Baowu agreement is Rio Tinto\u2019s second project attacking scope 3 emissions. Last year, the company entered an agreement with the Canadian government, Alcoa and Apple to develop a carbon-free method of making aluminium. Steelmakers around the world are under increasing pressure to curb their emissions. In Europe, carbon pricing has crimped steel mill profits, putting jobs at risk and forcing companies to look for alternatives to coal to save on emissions costs. Both Rio Tinto and BHP have said they want to dramatically reduce their emissions but the strong language has so far not been enough to satisfy activists. Rio Tinto says it supports the international Paris agreement, which is designed to keep the increase in global temperature below 2C, and is aiming for the \u201csubstantial decarbonisation\u201d of its entire business by 2050.

As the situation worsened at the company, payment service providers including American Express, UniCredit and Barclaycard moved to protect themselves from potential losses in the case of a collapse. Fankhauser said: \u201c[They] took steps to mitigate their financial exposure to the group, such as by withholding cash collections and cancelling the payment services which they provide to the group. \u201cThese actions further demonstrated that the company\u2019s stakeholders were beginning to take steps that negatively impacted the company\u2019s liquidity and financial position.\u201d",

When there is no meat left to butcher or consume, sustenance is derived from the enunciation of words. The characters luxuriate in and savour language.

As the Captain, Hughes provides an eloquent counterpoint to the family\u2019s emotional inertia.

Exchanges feel tautological. Though labouring through language might be critical when language itself is the last mode of survival, it nevertheless inhibits the drama. The resolution, when it arrives, feels sudden. <br><br>One feels the play aims at a Beckettian nowhere while also being somewhere very specific; that its old language is a metaphor for all old languages, when it is clearly a specific old language. It\u2019s an ambitious mixture, for sure, but at the end its ambitions are unreconciled.</p> <ul> <li><p>At the <a href=\"https://www.shermantheatre.co.uk/performance/theatre/on-bear-ridge/\">Sherman theatre, Cardiff</a>, until 5 October.

Ed Thomas\u2019s play, presented by National Theatre Wales and the Royal Court, is set after an undefined societal, environmental and deeply personal catastrophe. When there is no meat left to butcher or consume, sustenance is derived from the enunciation of words. The characters luxuriate in and savour language. Although no longer able to speak \u201cthe old language\u201d \u2013 lost, like the chapel, to rampant urban capitalism \u2013 words become maps and pieces of jigsaws, the only things that tether these sad figures to their present. Co-directed by the playwright alongside Vicky Featherstone, this is Thomas\u2019s first stage play for 15 years. In many ways, it is a continuation of his earlier theatrical works, which were a mixture of lyrical realism and absurdity, located in often beleaguered Welsh landscapes. It is finely acted. Ifans and Ayola suggest a life lived together with heartbreaking ease, both saturated to their bones with grief. Ayola\u2019s performance is beautiful, possessing a grounded stillness that holds together the entire world. She and Young find surprising emotional nuance in brief, throwaway lines. As the Captain, Hughes provides an eloquent counterpoint to the family\u2019s emotional inertia. In Cai Dyfan\u2019s handsome design, the shop opens into a claustrophobic expanse, and Elliot Griggs\u2019s lighting \u2013 golds and flashes and silhouettes \u2013 sets mood as well as rhythm. But while persuasively staged, the script meanders like the Captain lost on a snowy hillside. Exchanges feel tautological. Though labouring through language might be critical when language itself is the last mode of survival, it nevertheless inhibits the drama. The resolution, when it arrives, feels sudden. One feels the play aims at a Beckettian nowhere while also being somewhere very specific; that its old language is a metaphor for all old languages, when it is clearly a specific old language. It\u2019s an ambitious mixture, for sure, but at the end its ambitions are unreconciled. At the Sherman theatre, Cardiff, until 5 October. Then at the Royal Court, London, 24 October to 23 November.",

Less than five years after construction began, the 450bn yuan (\u00a350bn) Daxing international airport was officially opened on Wednesday in a ceremony attended by the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. China is preparing to celebrate its National Day on 1 October, marking 70 years since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, against the backdrop of unrest in Hong Kong and a flagging economy.

According to Deadline, the three actors will reprise their roles from the Steven Spielberg-directed dinosaur film, released in 1993 to record box office. Goldblum played mathematician Ian Malcolm, utterer of the celebrated line \u201cLife finds a way\u201d, while Dern and Neill played paleontologists Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant. The Jurassic World spin-off series began in 2015, after the disappointing commercial performance of The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III, and proved a substantial box-office success, taking $1.7bn worldwide for Jurassic World and $1.3bn for its 2018 follow-up, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Currently known as Jurassic World 3, the new film will be directed by Colin Trevorrow (returning to the series after stepping aside for JA Bayona for Fallen Kingdom), and stars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. It is due to start shooting next year, with a planned release date of 11 June 2021. Interest in the film has also been stoked by the release of an eight-minute Jurassic World spin-off short film, titled Battle at Big Rock, directed by Trevorrow.",

Hundreds of thousands of Instagrammers have shared photos of eye-catching floors using the #ihavethisthingwithfloors hashtag. Featuring striking geometric designs, positive affirmations and colourful bricks, they reveal that attractive floors can appear in some pretty unlikely places \u2013 such as this one in Dallas/Fort Worth international airport. The craze started one night in a bar in Amsterdam when work friends Edith Beurskens, Josha Jansen and Pien van Wijmen discovered they had something in common: they all enjoyed sharing pictures of their feet on attractive floors on Instagram. They decided to create a dedicated account where they could share their own photos and re-gram beautiful floors, using the hashtag #ihavethisthingwithfloors. Instagrammers are instructed: \u201cWhen feet meet nice floors, take a selfeet.\u201d Five years later, more than 845,000 photos have been shared from cities from H\u1ed9i An to Beirut to Miami. Some are featured on the team\u2019s original account, often coupled with an inspirational or punny caption.

      "body": "<p>Capitalism reigns. But capitalism is in trouble. Therein lies the paradox of our age. For the first time in human history, a single economic system spans the globe. Of course there are differences between capitalism Chinese-style, American-style and Swedish-style. Close up, these differences can seem significant. But viewed through a wider lens, the distinctions blur. As the economist Branco Milanovic writes in his new book, Capitalism Alone, \u201cthe entire globe now operates according to the same economic principles \u2013 production organized for profit using legally free wage labor and mostly privately owned capital, with decentralized coordination\u201d.</p> <p>After the fall of Soviet communism in 1989, and China\u2019s embrace of the market, crowned by the nation\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, it seemed, for a brief flicker of human history, that the world was converging on a political economy of free markets in liberal democracies. As it turned out, markets spread, but without necessarily bringing more democracy or liberalism along with them.</p> <p>Capitalism without democracy was assumed to be at most a passing phase. Eventually, so western liberal thinking went, China and other Asian nations adopting what Milanovic calls \u201cpolitical capitalism\u201d \u2013 free markets, but authoritarian politics \u2013 would have to adopt liberal political institutions, too. But, so far, the liberalization thesis remains unproven. China has successfully adopted a market system \u2013 and, even more importantly, a market culture \u2013 without liberal democratic institutions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Opinion&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Broken%20Capitalism&amp;description=Wage%20stagflation%2C%20inequality%2C%20soaring%20CEO%20pay%2C%20market%20monopolies%20and%20food%20banks%20-%20why%20are%20the%20fruits%20of%20capitalism%20distributed%20so%20unfairly%3F%20Why%20does%20capitalism%20work%20for%20the%20few%2C%20but%20not%20the%20many%3F%20This%20ongoing%20series%20is%20a%20collaboration%20between%20The%20Guardian%20and%20Richard%20Reeves%2C%20author%20of%20Dream%20Hoarders%20and%20Senior%20Fellow%20at%20Brookings%20Institution.%20It%20will%20query%20why%20discontent%20with%20capitalism%20is%20rising%20and%20ask%20if%20it%20can%20it%20be%20repaired%3F&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2Fseries%2Fbroken-capitalism&amp;links=true&amp;link-1-headline=Boeing\u2019s%20travails%20show%20what\u2019s%20wrong%20with%20modern%20capitalism&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2019%2Fsep%2F11%2Fboeing-capitalism-deregulation&amp;link-2-headline=To%20rescue%20democracy%2C%20we%20must%20revive%20the%20reforms%20of%20the%20Progressive%20Era&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2019%2Faug%2F30%2Fdemocracy-capitalism-progressive-era-gilded-age&amp;link-3-headline=Yes%2C%20contemporary%20capitalism%20can%20be%20compatible%20with%20liberal%20democracy&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2019%2Faug%2F21%2Fcontemporary-capitalism-liberal-democracy-policies\" data-alt=\"series box\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Opinion&opinion-tint=false&title=Broken%20Capitalism&description=Wage%20stagflation%2C%20inequality%2C%20soaring%20CEO%20pay%2C%20market%20monopolies%20and%20food%20banks%20-%20why%20are%20the%20fruits%20of%20capitalism%20distributed%20so%20unfairly%3F%20Why%20does%20capitalism%20work%20for%20the%20few%2C%20but%20not%20the%20many%3F%20This%20ongoing%20series%20is%20a%20collaboration%20between%20The%20Guardian%20and%20Richard%20Reeves%2C%20author%20of%20Dream%20Hoarders%20and%20Senior%20Fellow%20at%20Brookings%20Institution.%20It%20will%20query%20why%20discontent%20with%20capitalism%20is%20rising%20and%20ask%20if%20it%20can%20it%20be%20repaired%3F&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2Fseries%2Fbroken-capitalism&links=true&link-1-headline=Boeing\u2019s%20travails%20show%20what\u2019s%20wrong%20with%20modern%20capitalism&link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2019%2Fsep%2F11%2Fboeing-capitalism-deregulation&link-2-headline=To%20rescue%20democracy%2C%20we%20must%20revive%20the%20reforms%20of%20the%20Progressive%20Era&link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2019%2Faug%2F30%2Fdemocracy-capitalism-progressive-era-gilded-age&link-3-headline=Yes%2C%20contemporary%20capitalism%20can%20be%20compatible%20with%20liberal%20democracy&link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2019%2Faug%2F21%2Fcontemporary-capitalism-liberal-democracy-policies\">series box</a> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, western democracies are in various states of crisis, struggling to contain a resurgent populism. To a large extent, they are reaping what they have sown. After the Berlin Wall fell, the western technocratic and political elite became complacent, hubristic, and arrogant. Over dinner in cosmopolitan cities, they discussed Fukuyama\u2019s The End of History, pushed further and faster towards freer trade and more porous borders, and insisted that inequality was being sanitized by meritocracy. The elite reformed our leftwing parties into Third Way parties, who swept to power: this was the era of Clinton, Blair and Schroeder. Yes, there were problems, but nothing beyond the reach of centrist technocratic solutions; a little retraining here, some social liberalization there.</p> <p>\u201cLooking back, the era since the fall of the Berlin Wall seems like one of complacency, or opportunities lost,\u201d said the novelist Kazuo Ishiguro in his 2017 Nobel lecture. \u201cEnormous inequalities \u2013 of wealth and opportunity \u2013 have been allowed to grow ... and the long years of austerity policies imposed on ordinary people following the scandalous economic crash of 2008 have brought us to a present in which far right ideologies and tribal nationalisms proliferate. Racism is once again on the rise, stirring beneath our civilised streets like a buried monster awakening.\u201d</p> <p>Western liberals thought they had won, because they looked around the world at burgeoning markets. But they missed the fact that they were losing, slowly but steadily, in their own backyards. As soon as working class voters were given outlets for their anger \u2013 Donald Trump, Brexit \u2013 it poured out of them. The populist stew is of course a complex concoction, mixing misanthropy and nativism with genuine concerns about economic prospects.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Western liberals thought they had won, because they looked around the world at burgeoning markets. But they missed the fact that they were losing in their own backyards</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Political leaders, disoriented by the backlash, are tempted by cultural explanations, as Hillary Clinton\u2019s unfortunate description of some of Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201cdeplorables\u201d. The phrase was taken out of context before being bounced around every social media echo chamber. But today Trump\u2019s most ardent followers wear \u201cdeplorable\u201d as a badge of honor. A decade ago, Barack Obama worried about folks who \u201ccling to guns or religion\u201d.

Philosophically, liberals will have to start by eating many slices of humble pie. It turned out to be a terrible mistake to assume that capitalism and democracy naturally go hand in hand. Perhaps an understandable one, given a certain historical view. Liberal democracy and liberal capitalism were, after all, twins, born of the European Enlightenment. But as history has shown repeatedly, they can be separated. It is simply wishful thinking to believe that some deep natural processes drive liberal causes. They have to be fought for, over and over and over again. Plato\u2019s line about democracy being \u201ca wonderfully pleasant way of carrying on in the short run\u201d used to be a modernists\u2019 laugh-line. But we\u2019re not laughing now.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>For liberal democracy to recover, we will have to recast prevailing liberal philosophy, politics and economic policy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Politically, the challenge is to reassert the authority of government over the market, not in order to cramp competition but in order to see it flourish. The corruption of government by powerful businesses is not a weird anomaly. It is precisely where market incentives lead; the currency of political economy is not money but power.</p> <p>\u201cThe fundamental concept in social science is Power,\u201d wrote the British philosopher Bertrand Russell, \u201cin the same sense in which Energy is the fundamental concept in physics\u201d.

If economic power or priestly power can be readily turned into political power, for instance, we should be wary of the likely result. Democracies have to be constantly patrolling the borders between different sources of power. Separation of powers is a political principle, not just a constitutional one. Russell was concerned about power because he was a liberal. In fact, he was John Stuart Mill\u2019s secular godson. (Both of them spent time in jail for their beliefs, but <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/John-Stuart-Mill-Victorian-Firebrand/dp/1843546442\">that\u2019s another story</a>.)</p> <p>The concatenation of political and economic power, especially in the US, is intrinsically damaging, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/11/boeing-capitalism-deregulation\">Matt Stoller showed in this series</a>.

At heart, both are massive power-sharing agreements. Capitalism works best when it acts in a centrifugal manner to disperse power, less well when it tends towards concentration. Right now, capitalism in many nations, including the US, is tending more towards centripetal than centrifugal capitalism \u2013 as many of the essays in this series have shown, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/30/democracy-capitalism-progressive-era-gilded-age\">from Ganesh Sitaranam</a>.</p> <p>Economic power is being concentrated geographically.

      "bodyText": "Capitalism reigns. But capitalism is in trouble. Therein lies the paradox of our age. For the first time in human history, a single economic system spans the globe. Of course there are differences between capitalism Chinese-style, American-style and Swedish-style. Close up, these differences can seem significant. But viewed through a wider lens, the distinctions blur. As the economist Branco Milanovic writes in his new book, Capitalism Alone, \u201cthe entire globe now operates according to the same economic principles \u2013 production organized for profit using legally free wage labor and mostly privately owned capital, with decentralized coordination\u201d. After the fall of Soviet communism in 1989, and China\u2019s embrace of the market, crowned by the nation\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, it seemed, for a brief flicker of human history, that the world was converging on a political economy of free markets in liberal democracies. As it turned out, markets spread, but without necessarily bringing more democracy or liberalism along with them. Capitalism without democracy was assumed to be at most a passing phase. Eventually, so western liberal thinking went, China and other Asian nations adopting what Milanovic calls \u201cpolitical capitalism\u201d \u2013 free markets, but authoritarian politics \u2013 would have to adopt liberal political institutions, too. But, so far, the liberalization thesis remains unproven. China has successfully adopted a market system \u2013 and, even more importantly, a market culture \u2013 without liberal democratic institutions. Meanwhile, western democracies are in various states of crisis, struggling to contain a resurgent populism. To a large extent, they are reaping what they have sown. After the Berlin Wall fell, the western technocratic and political elite became complacent, hubristic, and arrogant. Over dinner in cosmopolitan cities, they discussed Fukuyama\u2019s The End of History, pushed further and faster towards freer trade and more porous borders, and insisted that inequality was being sanitized by meritocracy. The elite reformed our leftwing parties into Third Way parties, who swept to power: this was the era of Clinton, Blair and Schroeder. Yes, there were problems, but nothing beyond the reach of centrist technocratic solutions; a little retraining here, some social liberalization there. \u201cLooking back, the era since the fall of the Berlin Wall seems like one of complacency, or opportunities lost,\u201d said the novelist Kazuo Ishiguro in his 2017 Nobel lecture. \u201cEnormous inequalities \u2013 of wealth and opportunity \u2013 have been allowed to grow ... and the long years of austerity policies imposed on ordinary people following the scandalous economic crash of 2008 have brought us to a present in which far right ideologies and tribal nationalisms proliferate. Racism is once again on the rise, stirring beneath our civilised streets like a buried monster awakening.\u201d Western liberals thought they had won, because they looked around the world at burgeoning markets. But they missed the fact that they were losing, slowly but steadily, in their own backyards. As soon as working class voters were given outlets for their anger \u2013 Donald Trump, Brexit \u2013 it poured out of them. The populist stew is of course a complex concoction, mixing misanthropy and nativism with genuine concerns about economic prospects. Political leaders, disoriented by the backlash, are tempted by cultural explanations, as Hillary Clinton\u2019s unfortunate description of some of Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201cdeplorables\u201d. The phrase was taken out of context before being bounced around every social media echo chamber. But today Trump\u2019s most ardent followers wear \u201cdeplorable\u201d as a badge of honor. A decade ago, Barack Obama worried about folks who \u201ccling to guns or religion\u201d. When voters feel that they are being looked down on, they are sure to become angry. Ishiguro\u2019s accusation (a self-accusation, too, I should add) of complacency is exactly right. We made the economic arguments for free trade, automation and immigration on the grounds that on net, and in the long run, these are good for the economy. True, as a matter of economic fact. But what we paid insufficient attention to was the necessary implication that right now, some real people will lose out.

      "body": "<p>On a crisp, newly autumnal night on Oxford Street in London, the 100 Club has a line of mostly old-school mods and skinheads wearing denim jackets and Fred Perry polo shirts, carrying 1970s-styled holdalls. The queue stretches across the front of several chain stores with people from all over the country \u2013 and even Italy \u2013 waiting to be let in.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/nov/11/the-gig-venue-guide-the-100-club-london\">100 Club</a> might be better known for its punk rock history, but the 6Ts Rhythm and Soul Society nights are celebrating their 40th anniversary, thus making it the longest-running club night in London and the longest-running <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/18/how-to-dance-to-northern-soul-1970s-dance\">northern soul</a> night in the world. Despite recent club closures and changing music tastes, 6Ts has held firm.</p> <p>The room is full by around 11.30pm with barely any space to dance; most people are over the age of 45, with an equal split of men and women. With the DJ gauging that the crowd are anticipating northern soul\u2019s biggest anthems, that\u2019s what we get: Sandi Sheldon\u2019s You\u2019re Gonna Make Me Love You, Soul Incorporated\u2019s My Proposal and Luther Ingram\u2019s If It\u2019s All the Same to You Babe. The dancefloor is quickly coated in sweat from the dancers\u2019 faces. There\u2019s a lot of swift, nifty footwork, including some trademark northern soul spins and shuffles, which are greatly aided by the talcum powder laid down to add traction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb3d1aeaf9514b6d093929423857ce1f2e145b7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb3d1aeaf9514b6d093929423857ce1f2e145b7a/24_24_1150_761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Murder on the dancefloor \u2026 a man gets the dancing going at 6Ts Rhythm and Soul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murder on the dancefloor \u2026 a man gets the dancing going at 6Ts Rhythm and Soul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Marshall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the bar is a small record stall with originals fetching anywhere between \u00a320 and \u00a3900. The crate-digging culture on the northern soul scene is often likened to train-spotting, complete with sage discussion of matrix numbers etched into the record itself. The most expensive northern soul record to date is Frank Wilson\u2019s Do I Love You (Indeed I Do), which was sold at auction for \u00a325,000 in 2009 \u2013 there are only two known copies in existence.</p> <p>6Ts began in August 1979 at the Bedford Head pub in Covent Garden, coinciding with the release of the film Quadrophenia, which helped kickstart the revival of the mod scene. Mods had themselves kickstarted northern soul in the late 1960s, thanks to their love of a particular kind of heavy, anthemic, danceable US soul music \u2013 the sound quickly took hold in clubs like Wigan Casino and Manchester\u2019s Twisted Wheel. \u201cThe new mods would have been about 20% to start with, in terms of the crowd,\u201d Ady Croasdell explains.</p> <p>The other 80% were avid northern soul heads from across the country, looking for newer sounds as the old classics began to grow stale. And when Wigan Casino began to decline as the DJs catered to tourists \u2013 mostly from London \u2013 favouring pop songs with the slightest hint of a uptempo beat, the old guard wanted an alternative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f01cece753b3d086ac6108c9abe42bfc8f681322\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f01cece753b3d086ac6108c9abe42bfc8f681322/27_20_1148_764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ady Croasdell on the decks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ady Croasdell on the decks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Marshall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Northern soul in the 70s was counter-cultural, and many looked to 6Ts for new discoveries of long-lost records that had been found by record collectors on regular visits to American warehouses and record company vaults. Some were often demos from singers who made one song, and then went back to their regular jobs as bus drivers or cleaners.</p> <p>\u201cBefore 6Ts we had northern soul nights in London but only 30 or 40 people would turn up, as opposed to thousands up north,\u201d Ady explains. \u201cWe were all on a big learning curve, but we already knew a lot of people, and being a record dealer I had a good reputation with other DJs and collectors.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, soulies from all over the country would flock to London just to hear rare records on a Friday night. To this day, Croasdell puts its success down to \u201cmainly luck\u201d and playing \u201cexclusive new-old discoveries that put us at the cutting-edge of northern soul\u201d.</p> <p>After a hop from Covent Garden to West Hampstead, he moved to the 100 Club in 1981.

      "bodyText": "On a crisp, newly autumnal night on Oxford Street in London, the 100 Club has a line of mostly old-school mods and skinheads wearing denim jackets and Fred Perry polo shirts, carrying 1970s-styled holdalls. The queue stretches across the front of several chain stores with people from all over the country \u2013 and even Italy \u2013 waiting to be let in. The 100 Club might be better known for its punk rock history, but the 6Ts Rhythm and Soul Society nights are celebrating their 40th anniversary, thus making it the longest-running club night in London and the longest-running northern soul night in the world. Despite recent club closures and changing music tastes, 6Ts has held firm. The room is full by around 11.30pm with barely any space to dance; most people are over the age of 45, with an equal split of men and women. With the DJ gauging that the crowd are anticipating northern soul\u2019s biggest anthems, that\u2019s what we get: Sandi Sheldon\u2019s You\u2019re Gonna Make Me Love You, Soul Incorporated\u2019s My Proposal and Luther Ingram\u2019s If It\u2019s All the Same to You Babe. The dancefloor is quickly coated in sweat from the dancers\u2019 faces. There\u2019s a lot of swift, nifty footwork, including some trademark northern soul spins and shuffles, which are greatly aided by the talcum powder laid down to add traction. By the bar is a small record stall with originals fetching anywhere between \u00a320 and \u00a3900. The crate-digging culture on the northern soul scene is often likened to train-spotting, complete with sage discussion of matrix numbers etched into the record itself. The most expensive northern soul record to date is Frank Wilson\u2019s Do I Love You (Indeed I Do), which was sold at auction for \u00a325,000 in 2009 \u2013 there are only two known copies in existence. 6Ts began in August 1979 at the Bedford Head pub in Covent Garden, coinciding with the release of the film Quadrophenia, which helped kickstart the revival of the mod scene. Mods had themselves kickstarted northern soul in the late 1960s, thanks to their love of a particular kind of heavy, anthemic, danceable US soul music \u2013 the sound quickly took hold in clubs like Wigan Casino and Manchester\u2019s Twisted Wheel. \u201cThe new mods would have been about 20% to start with, in terms of the crowd,\u201d Ady Croasdell explains. The other 80% were avid northern soul heads from across the country, looking for newer sounds as the old classics began to grow stale. And when Wigan Casino began to decline as the DJs catered to tourists \u2013 mostly from London \u2013 favouring pop songs with the slightest hint of a uptempo beat, the old guard wanted an alternative. Northern soul in the 70s was counter-cultural, and many looked to 6Ts for new discoveries of long-lost records that had been found by record collectors on regular visits to American warehouses and record company vaults. Some were often demos from singers who made one song, and then went back to their regular jobs as bus drivers or cleaners. \u201cBefore 6Ts we had northern soul nights in London but only 30 or 40 people would turn up, as opposed to thousands up north,\u201d Ady explains. \u201cWe were all on a big learning curve, but we already knew a lot of people, and being a record dealer I had a good reputation with other DJs and collectors.\u201d As a result, soulies from all over the country would flock to London just to hear rare records on a Friday night. To this day, Croasdell puts its success down to \u201cmainly luck\u201d and playing \u201cexclusive new-old discoveries that put us at the cutting-edge of northern soul\u201d. After a hop from Covent Garden to West Hampstead, he moved to the 100 Club in 1981. To commemorate each passing anniversary, they release a 7in single, only available to those who buy a ticket \u2013 some fetch up to hundreds of pounds on eBay. This year\u2019s release was Ready or Not, Here Comes Love by Carolyn Crawford with I Stand Blue by Mickey Stevenson as the B-side. At around 2am, when it\u2019s Croasdell\u2019s turn to man the decks onstage, he airs it: \u201cYou all have this single, and it\u2019s fucking great!\u201d At 3am, fellow 6Ts promoter, curator and DJ Matt Bolton, as well as resident DJ Butch, make a framed presentation to Croasdell for his Outstanding Contribution to Soul Music, with touching tributes from other DJs on the soul scene. There\u2019s a poignant, touching tribute for \u201ca few of those that can\u2019t be with us tonight\u201d, referring to co-founder Randy Cozens, who died of cancer in 2003, with an airing of Bettye Swann\u2019s Kiss My Love Goodbye. When the all-nighter comes to a close at 6am on Sunday morning, the traditional final three songs of every 6Ts night play out: Carla Thomas\u2019s I\u2019ll Never Stop Loving You, Four Tops\u2019 Baby I Need Your Loving, and Walter Jackson\u2019s That\u2019s What Mama Say. Walking outside after eight hours of dancing, there\u2019s a feeling that \u2013 middle-aged or not \u2013 6Ts punters still have a lot of energy left in those legs.

      "body": "<p>I did some hard time in Alcatraz \u2013 the walking tour, then the gift shop. Three hours, maybe even three and a half, but that was long enough. A burly ex-guard led my tour party round his former workplace. He\u2019d written a memoir, which he kept mentioning as he took us through the bleak horrors. Gleefully, he led us into the concrete recreation yard, the library, the kitchen. At the climax came the solitary confinement cell \u2013 \u201cthe Hole\u201d. It was basically a coffin with a slightly higher ceiling. \u201cFor five extra bucks,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can stay inside, individually, and I\u2019ll slam the door on you.\u201d I didn\u2019t take up the offer. A long queue of others did. I listened to the iron door go slam, slam, slam.</p> <p>Looking back, I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t shell out for the experience. Like many people, I am obsessed with tales of great escapes. Tension/release is how most stories work. But the rawest, most extreme form is confinement/escape. And the more extreme the confinement, the more exhilarating the escape. Of course, there are lots of different ways a person can be in prison, and you don\u2019t always have to get outside your particular prison to get away from it.</p> <p>I was quite a few years into writing my novel <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/patience-9781910296998.html\">Patience</a> before I realised it was \u2013 among other things \u2013 a kind of prison-break story. The prison is a Catholic children\u2019s home in 1979, and the prisoner is a boy called Elliott who can move only one finger, but the basic obsessive situation of confinement/escape is the same. Elliott yearns to be free.</p> <p>Here are 10 of my favourite great escapes, because sometimes Steve McQueen\u2019s motorcycle <em>does</em> make it over the barbed wire fence.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/persuasion-38.html\">Persuasion by Jane Austen</a><br></strong>Anne Elliot is the oldest of Austen\u2019s heroines, and the longest-suffering. In order to reach her happy ending, she endures years of confinement. She isn\u2019t literally in solitary, but \u2013 as an unmarried not-so-young woman, dependent on her demanding father, she is as trapped as any prisoner. Worse still, she has no true companionship. She is surrounded by a grotesque gallery of the neurotic and the interfering, the boring and the presumptuous. Only the reader knows Anne\u2019s true worth. Her victorious escape from the hell of the English country house to be together with her true love, Captain Wentworth, makes her years of anguish worthwhile \u2013 almost. </p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/peregrine-2.html\">The Peregrine by JA Baker</a><br></strong>Chasing an elusive bird of prey around 1960s Essex, we track an even more elusive author. This was chosen by Werner Herzog as one of the course books for his <a href=\"http://roguefilmschool.com/about.asp\">Rogue Film School</a> \u2013 where he teaches lock-picking alongside cinematography. I applied in order to make a film version of Patience, but didn\u2019t get on. Discovering this renowned classic of nature writing was some consolation. In its pages, a man tries to escape his human nature. The final encounter between man and bird is visionary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e4bb634facfb2bf9d52b123ac1edf4f780f2e7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4bb634facfb2bf9d52b123ac1edf4f780f2e7d/986_311_2297_2872/800.jpg\" alt=\"Peter O\u2019Toole in the 1976 film of Rogue Male.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hitler in his sights \u2026 Peter O\u2019Toole in the 1976 film of Rogue Male.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Prod DB/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/rogue-male.html\">Rogue Male by Geoffrey Household</a><br></strong>This novel begins with the most brutal chase sequence. Ten pages in, and you\u2019ve winced so many times your face is aching. The main character is more like an animal fleeing a pack of hounds than a human protagonist. Eventually, he is forced to go to ground. And then the tension really starts. All of this is based on the gossamer premise that an English gentleman decides one day, out of curiosity, to see if he can assassinate Adolf Hitler.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/long-way.html\">The Long Way by Bernard Moitessier, translated by William Rodarmor</a><br></strong>Some people escape from concrete jails. For others safe, normal life is the worst imprisonment. In 1968, Moitessier \u2013 already a legendary sailor \u2013 is planning to sail solo around the world, without touching land. He can\u2019t be doing with shore life. When he hears about the Golden Globe yacht race, he decides to join in. He has the chance to win and gain the glory. But as he is sailing towards the finish, he realises it just another entrapment. If there\u2019s such a thing as enlightenment, Moitessier found it halfway across the South Atlantic.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://timesflowstemmed.com/2015/09/19/tomas-espedals-tramp/\">Tramp by Tomas Espedal, translated by James Anderson</a><br></strong>Where Moitessier needs a bespoke sailboat, and plenty of supplies, to make his escape from the unbearableness of the day-to-day, Tomas Espedal needs only to step outside the door, decide whether to turn left or right, and just keep walking. This existentially narked Norwegian feels imprisoned by his limited world \u2013 his flat, the local bar where he drinks and then drinks some more. When this gets too much for him, he walks. But he refuses to wear hiking gear, preferring a suit. He loves to chain smoke as he goes, so as to annoy the more conservative ramblers. This is a deep and hilarious book about small truancies.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/books/how-to-be-gay-by-david-m-halperin.html\">How to Be Gay by David M Halperin</a><br></strong>Not everyone can run away from their captors. Some have to live with them for ever. But that doesn\u2019t mean they have to live in the same way as them. This is a wonderful, personal history of the many ways the constraints of the straight world have been subverted or co-opted by gay culture. \u201cWhy Are the Drag Queens Laughing?\u201d asks one section of the book<em>.</em> Until I read this, I can honestly say I had absolutely no idea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e679e5fd96d825cdcf3a6bc796488b69d22c4f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e679e5fd96d825cdcf3a6bc796488b69d22c4f8/0_0_1558_2190/711.jpg\" alt=\"A page from Hostage by Guy Delisle.\" width=\"711\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A page from Hostage by Guy Delisle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Cape</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hostage-548247.html\">Hostage by Guy Delisle, translated by Helge Dascher</a><br></strong>For the longest time, this graphic novel is confined to the limited doings and far-straying thoughts of a bearded man lying on a mattress, his left wrist handcuffed to a radiator. But what could be dull is mesmerising. It is based on interviews with Christopher Andre, who was taken hostage in 1997, while working in Chechnya for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. The escape is super-tense.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/papillon.html\">Papillon by Henri Charri\u00e8re, translated by Patrick O\u2019Brian</a><br></strong>Another true story, Charri\u00e8re\u2019s merciless account of his incarceration in French Guiana, and his failed and successful escape bids, became a worldwide phenomenon when it was published in 1969. From childhood, I still remember the chunky paperback, with its cover image of a butterfly (papillon is French for butterfly) resting on a heavy padlock. There it was, on beaches and restaurant tables. It seemed as if my parents were reading it for most of the decade. With good reason.

      "bodyText": "I did some hard time in Alcatraz \u2013 the walking tour, then the gift shop. Three hours, maybe even three and a half, but that was long enough. A burly ex-guard led my tour party round his former workplace. He\u2019d written a memoir, which he kept mentioning as he took us through the bleak horrors. Gleefully, he led us into the concrete recreation yard, the library, the kitchen. At the climax came the solitary confinement cell \u2013 \u201cthe Hole\u201d. It was basically a coffin with a slightly higher ceiling. \u201cFor five extra bucks,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can stay inside, individually, and I\u2019ll slam the door on you.\u201d I didn\u2019t take up the offer. A long queue of others did. I listened to the iron door go slam, slam, slam. Looking back, I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t shell out for the experience. Like many people, I am obsessed with tales of great escapes. Tension/release is how most stories work. But the rawest, most extreme form is confinement/escape. And the more extreme the confinement, the more exhilarating the escape. Of course, there are lots of different ways a person can be in prison, and you don\u2019t always have to get outside your particular prison to get away from it. I was quite a few years into writing my novel Patience before I realised it was \u2013 among other things \u2013 a kind of prison-break story. The prison is a Catholic children\u2019s home in 1979, and the prisoner is a boy called Elliott who can move only one finger, but the basic obsessive situation of confinement/escape is the same. Elliott yearns to be free. Here are 10 of my favourite great escapes, because sometimes Steve McQueen\u2019s motorcycle does make it over the barbed wire fence. 1. Persuasion by Jane Austen Anne Elliot is the oldest of Austen\u2019s heroines, and the longest-suffering. In order to reach her happy ending, she endures years of confinement. She isn\u2019t literally in solitary, but \u2013 as an unmarried not-so-young woman, dependent on her demanding father, she is as trapped as any prisoner. Worse still, she has no true companionship. She is surrounded by a grotesque gallery of the neurotic and the interfering, the boring and the presumptuous. Only the reader knows Anne\u2019s true worth. Her victorious escape from the hell of the English country house to be together with her true love, Captain Wentworth, makes her years of anguish worthwhile \u2013 almost. 2. The Peregrine by JA Baker Chasing an elusive bird of prey around 1960s Essex, we track an even more elusive author. This was chosen by Werner Herzog as one of the course books for his Rogue Film School \u2013 where he teaches lock-picking alongside cinematography. I applied in order to make a film version of Patience, but didn\u2019t get on. Discovering this renowned classic of nature writing was some consolation. In its pages, a man tries to escape his human nature. The final encounter between man and bird is visionary. 3. Rogue Male by Geoffrey Household This novel begins with the most brutal chase sequence. Ten pages in, and you\u2019ve winced so many times your face is aching. The main character is more like an animal fleeing a pack of hounds than a human protagonist. Eventually, he is forced to go to ground. And then the tension really starts. All of this is based on the gossamer premise that an English gentleman decides one day, out of curiosity, to see if he can assassinate Adolf Hitler. 4. The Long Way by Bernard Moitessier, translated by William Rodarmor Some people escape from concrete jails. For others safe, normal life is the worst imprisonment. In 1968, Moitessier \u2013 already a legendary sailor \u2013 is planning to sail solo around the world, without touching land. He can\u2019t be doing with shore life. When he hears about the Golden Globe yacht race, he decides to join in. He has the chance to win and gain the glory. But as he is sailing towards the finish, he realises it just another entrapment. If there\u2019s such a thing as enlightenment, Moitessier found it halfway across the South Atlantic. 5. Tramp by Tomas Espedal, translated by James Anderson Where Moitessier needs a bespoke sailboat, and plenty of supplies, to make his escape from the unbearableness of the day-to-day, Tomas Espedal needs only to step outside the door, decide whether to turn left or right, and just keep walking. This existentially narked Norwegian feels imprisoned by his limited world \u2013 his flat, the local bar where he drinks and then drinks some more. When this gets too much for him, he walks. But he refuses to wear hiking gear, preferring a suit. He loves to chain smoke as he goes, so as to annoy the more conservative ramblers. This is a deep and hilarious book about small truancies. 6. How to Be Gay by David M Halperin Not everyone can run away from their captors. Some have to live with them for ever. But that doesn\u2019t mean they have to live in the same way as them. This is a wonderful, personal history of the many ways the constraints of the straight world have been subverted or co-opted by gay culture. \u201cWhy Are the Drag Queens Laughing?\u201d asks one section of the book. Until I read this, I can honestly say I had absolutely no idea. 7. Hostage by Guy Delisle, translated by Helge Dascher For the longest time, this graphic novel is confined to the limited doings and far-straying thoughts of a bearded man lying on a mattress, his left wrist handcuffed to a radiator. But what could be dull is mesmerising. It is based on interviews with Christopher Andre, who was taken hostage in 1997, while working in Chechnya for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. The escape is super-tense. 8. Papillon by Henri Charri\u00e8re, translated by Patrick O\u2019Brian Another true story, Charri\u00e8re\u2019s merciless account of his incarceration in French Guiana, and his failed and successful escape bids, became a worldwide phenomenon when it was published in 1969. From childhood, I still remember the chunky paperback, with its cover image of a butterfly (papillon is French for butterfly) resting on a heavy padlock. There it was, on beaches and restaurant tables. It seemed as if my parents were reading it for most of the decade. With good reason. Some say this is the greatest of all escapes. 9. \u00c1gua Viva by Clarice Lispector, translated by Stefan Tobler A recent discovery, this is a fictional account of a woman\u2019s attempt to escape from conventional time and exist instead in a perpetually renewing \u201cthis instant-now\u201d. Lispector pursued this same seemingly impossible aim through a number of books \u2013 getting closer and closer to the confused and thrilling feeling of fully conscious aliveness. Agua Viva is where she succeeds most amazingly. 10. The Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester When I asked my friends for their favourite books of escape, The Count of Monte Cristo was so frequently and fondly picked that it seems silly to leave it out. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve never read it. And so for my ultimate selection I\u2019m going for this novel, (sometimes known as Tiger! Tiger!).

      "bodyText": "The supreme court judgment that Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament was unlawful has been met with a mix of anger, disbelief and concern in the Conservative party. Although government figures had been pessimistic ahead of the verdict, they were still taken back by the fact the ruling was unanimous. On hearing the news, Brexiteers were quick to take to the Tory MP WhatsApp group to query the judgment. A number pointed out that in reading the judgment, Lady Hale \u2013 president of the supreme court \u2013 had wrongly named Conservative MP Mark Harper as chief whip when in fact it is Mark Spencer. If she got that wrong, they contended, what else? The official party line is to question the judgment but not the judges who made it. During a cabinet call on Tuesday night, the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, said colleagues ought to refrain from criticising the motives of the judges. As for the ruling, the mood in government is unapologetic. Michael Gove has publicly said he believes the government did nothing wrong. Expect more non-apologies in the coming days as Johnson and his ministers find themselves forced into the Commons and unable to avoid awkward questions. With no working majority \u2013 it\u2019s currently in the region of -40 \u2013 the government will be the subject of ritual humiliation for weeks to come. While Labour remains unwilling to go for an early election until no deal is off the table, Johnson is stuck in the Commons against his will. Opposition MPs \u2013 with some help from Tory rebels \u2013 have a host of measures planned to try to strengthen their anti-no-deal plans and to force Johnson to face scrutiny on a range of issues, and ask for an extension from the EU next month. As for Johnson, there are limits to how he can respond. He could try to prorogue again \u2013 but it could only be for a couple of days this time. Until opposition MPs agree to an election, the most obvious route out is for the prime minister to resign \u2013 something he has repeatedly said he will not do. Senior Tories worry about the implication of a resignation in a subsequent general election campaign. He would be expected to recommend someone to lead in his place. It\u2019s much harder to argue that Jeremy Corbyn is unfit for the office of prime minister if you have suggested to the Queen he could be your stand-in. \u201cWe are trapped,\u201d laments one member of government.

Or how about: please name the goalscorer who would go on to be awarded an MBE after setting what was a Football League appearances record? Hats off to those who can identify Dave Booth, the Grimsby Town manager who masterminded a 3-2 win against their promotion rivals Chelsea in the old second division on an afternoon when his side had been 2-0 down with an hour gone. Watched by a crowd of 13,151, it was one of only four league defeats suffered by the late John Neal\u2019s team as they headed for the title and a first return to England\u2019s top flight since 1979. Booth, now 70 and coaching second-tier Ozone FC in Bangalore, would end up in fifth place with Grimsby that season. He was a product of Wakefield\u2019s famous Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, where he played rugby and cricket and was particularly fascinated by geography lessons. That perhaps explains why he resigned from managing Grimsby in 1985 to run an overseas property-development business, returning to UK for a brief stint at Darlington before becoming a confirmed expatriate in 1996. Since kicking off an itinerant coaching career with a side in Brunei playing in the Malaysian League, Booth has since managed 13 clubs in six more countries \u2013 India, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, the Maldives and Vietnam \u2013 in addition to two national sides: Myanmar and Laos. As for the goalscorer, the answer is Tony Ford MBE, who struck the 77th-minute winner after a Kerry Dixon penalty and a goal from John Bumstead had seen Chelsea canter into a deceptively comfortable-looking lead. The tide began turning in the 65th minute when Joe Waters reduced the deficit, before Paul Emson\u2019s equaliser and Ford\u2019s decider. Ford made a record 931 league appearances with nine clubs \u2013 including a brief loan at Sunderland \u2013 over a career which began as a 16-year-old flying winger with Grimsby and concluded as a 42-year-old right-back at Rochdale. In December 1983 Ford\u2019s youthful pace helped destabilise a strong home XI including Dixon, Eddie Niedzwiecki, Paul Canoville, John Hollins, Nigel Spackman, Pat Nevin, David Speedie. Incredible as it may seem today, Canoville and Ford were the first black players to appear for Chelsea and Grimsby respectively.

I\u2019d think: \u2018He\u2019s playing back at his club, why am I not doing it?\u2019 But I learned pretty quickly that each and every player goes on a different journey. Although I had to take a step back pretty early, I can still kick on massively with Bristol City and take my career to the next level.\u201d</p> <p>Moore, a down-to-earth, erudite young man, makes captivating company over an hour at Ashton Gate as he discusses seeking the help of a mental coach, going from a \u201cboy to a man\u201d, learning how \u201cto defend like a bloke\u201d on loan at Cheltenham in League Two under Gary Johnson, father of the City head coach, Lee \u2013 and trying to keep track of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in the Coupe Gambardella, the French equivalent of the FA Youth Cup.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d already pulled my hamstring but I tried to play on a little bit and completely tore it when he went through on goal \u2013 that\u2019s how quick he was; I couldn\u2019t catch him,\u201d says Moore, laughing. \u201cNo chance. I remember playing against PSG, I played as a central midfielder and Kingsley Coman played as a No 10. I think he played 60 minutes and he scored three goals. All three of them had nothing to do with me, thank God; I had a fairly good game actually. One of the [FA] delegates came out to watch that game so I didn\u2019t quite know what he was going to make of it after that but, thankfully, from an individual point of view, I played quite well and it was enough to get into the England team.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74ad35b648f9356e3b75c33026e17a8565782918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74ad35b648f9356e3b75c33026e17a8565782918/0_167_4072_2494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Moore in action against Hull City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"612\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Moore in action against Hull City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greig Cowie/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moore, 22, is mature enough to recognise he was not prepared for first-team football on arrival at Bristol City, and loans to Bury (\u201cthe club was in big financial trouble back then, I didn\u2019t have my rent paid\u201d), Cheltenham and, last season, Southend, followed. Some went better than others, with a season at Cheltenham under Johnson Sr a steep learning curve. \u201cI could think of four or five situations where I probably cost us games at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned how to defend like a bloke, like a man, because in certain situations I\u2019d be trying to play the nice tiki-taka you never see in League Two.</p> <p>\u201cIt was definitely a challenge,\u201d he says, puffing his cheeks. \u201cGoing from that difficult season, coming back and having a meeting with the manager here at the end of the season, when he had the feedback from his dad and it was pretty negative in general. And rightfully so, because it wasn\u2019t a pretty season for me although I played 40 games. We had a good conversation and the manager basically said: \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for Bristol City just yet. We might look at moving you on, loaning you out again, we\u2019re not too sure, but I\u2019m not too sure you\u2019re ready.\u2019 It was a negative outcome but that kind of fuelled me and gave me that bit more hunger to come back ready.\u201d</p> <p>Moore has not looked back, with a successful season at Southend under Chris Powell, who worked with him at England youth camps, priming him for a starting berth at Bristol City, where the defender has calmly stepped into the void left by Adam Webster. Before joining Southend, Moore says he effectively split the remaining year on his contract into two, halving his pay to get a contract extension. In August his progress was rewarded with a new two-year deal. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m back and I\u2019m here to stay. This is where I want to be in the long run and this is where I want to develop. I did absolutely everything I could this summer to show the manager, staff and the players that I am good enough.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>This season Moore has started seven of City\u2019s eight Championship games going into Saturday\u2019s match at third-placed Preston. Moore is adamant City, who finished eighth last season, are \u201cgoing places\u201d, touching on the attention to detail in training, where Johnson and his staff utilise virtual reality technology.</p> <p>\u201cI look a bit better than Carragher with it [the headset] on!\u201d Moore says, laughing. \u201cWe look back on certain situations. For example, Liverpool playing Napoli in the Champions League, we get into a Liverpool player\u2019s shoes and learn what you could or might do differently.\u201d</p> <p>Full-time flourishing centre-back, part-time translator?

I just grabbed him: \u2018Look, look.\u2019 All of that stuff helps him settle in and he absolutely loves it.

Although I had to take a step back pretty early, I can still kick on massively with Bristol City and take my career to the next level.\u201d Moore, a down-to-earth, erudite young man, makes captivating company over an hour at Ashton Gate as he discusses seeking the help of a mental coach, going from a \u201cboy to a man\u201d, learning how \u201cto defend like a bloke\u201d on loan at Cheltenham in League Two under Gary Johnson, father of the City head coach, Lee \u2013 and trying to keep track of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in the Coupe Gambardella, the French equivalent of the FA Youth Cup. \u201cI\u2019d already pulled my hamstring but I tried to play on a little bit and completely tore it when he went through on goal \u2013 that\u2019s how quick he was; I couldn\u2019t catch him,\u201d says Moore, laughing. \u201cNo chance. I remember playing against PSG, I played as a central midfielder and Kingsley Coman played as a No 10. I think he played 60 minutes and he scored three goals. All three of them had nothing to do with me, thank God; I had a fairly good game actually. One of the [FA] delegates came out to watch that game so I didn\u2019t quite know what he was going to make of it after that but, thankfully, from an individual point of view, I played quite well and it was enough to get into the England team.\u201d Moore, 22, is mature enough to recognise he was not prepared for first-team football on arrival at Bristol City, and loans to Bury (\u201cthe club was in big financial trouble back then, I didn\u2019t have my rent paid\u201d), Cheltenham and, last season, Southend, followed. Some went better than others, with a season at Cheltenham under Johnson Sr a steep learning curve. \u201cI could think of four or five situations where I probably cost us games at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned how to defend like a bloke, like a man, because in certain situations I\u2019d be trying to play the nice tiki-taka you never see in League Two. \u201cIt was definitely a challenge,\u201d he says, puffing his cheeks. \u201cGoing from that difficult season, coming back and having a meeting with the manager here at the end of the season, when he had the feedback from his dad and it was pretty negative in general. And rightfully so, because it wasn\u2019t a pretty season for me although I played 40 games. We had a good conversation and the manager basically said: \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for Bristol City just yet. We might look at moving you on, loaning you out again, we\u2019re not too sure, but I\u2019m not too sure you\u2019re ready.\u2019 It was a negative outcome but that kind of fuelled me and gave me that bit more hunger to come back ready.\u201d Moore has not looked back, with a successful season at Southend under Chris Powell, who worked with him at England youth camps, priming him for a starting berth at Bristol City, where the defender has calmly stepped into the void left by Adam Webster. Before joining Southend, Moore says he effectively split the remaining year on his contract into two, halving his pay to get a contract extension. In August his progress was rewarded with a new two-year deal. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m back and I\u2019m here to stay. This is where I want to be in the long run and this is where I want to develop. I did absolutely everything I could this summer to show the manager, staff and the players that I am good enough.\u201d This season Moore has started seven of City\u2019s eight Championship games going into Saturday\u2019s match at third-placed Preston. Moore is adamant City, who finished eighth last season, are \u201cgoing places\u201d, touching on the attention to detail in training, where Johnson and his staff utilise virtual reality technology. \u201cI look a bit better than Carragher with it [the headset] on!\u201d Moore says, laughing. \u201cWe look back on certain situations. For example, Liverpool playing Napoli in the Champions League, we get into a Liverpool player\u2019s shoes and learn what you could or might do differently.\u201d Full-time flourishing centre-back, part-time translator? Moore, who also speaks Spanish and some Portuguese, has helped the France Under-19s midfielder Han-Noah Massengo, a revelation since signing from Monaco, settle, as have French-speaking Famara Diedhiou, Benik Afobe and Kalifa Ciss\u00e9, who joined Johnson\u2019s backroom staff this summer. Massengo has proved a big hit with supporters, with the 18-year-old given a standing ovation after pressuring and then pickpocketing Swansea\u2019s Bersant Celina last weekend, and fans have been donning wigs in tribute to his afro. \u201cI\u2019ve got one already,\u201d Moore says, with a wry smile. \u201cWalking towards the tunnel, I had to do a double take to check I was actually seeing what I was seeing, all of these different Han-Noah Massengos. I just grabbed him: \u2018Look, look.\u2019 All of that stuff helps him settle in and he absolutely loves it. And, knowing Bristol City fans, they probably have a lot more up their sleeve \u2026\u201d",

When the trophy arrived at Boundary Park two days later at Roger Palmer\u2019s testimonial, it was engraved with West Ham\u2019s name.\u201d Theoretically playing more than 90 games in a season (revisited) \u201cGoing back a bit now (14 August), but I think Andy Brook\u2019s theoretical 94-game season for a League One team can be beaten,\u201d writes David Southworth. \u201cMy theoretical team hasn\u2019t won the Champions League or FA Cup, but last season they won the League Cup, which means they enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round. So they miss out on the Community Shield, Super Cup and World Club Cup, but more than make up for that with the extra Europa League games. As before, they make it to all possible finals, with FA Cup replays wherever possible, which gives them the following matches: League One 46, play-offs three, FA Cup 12, League Cup six, EFL Trophy eight, Europa League 21, giving a total of 96.\u201d Championship champions beating Premier League champions \u201cGiven Norwich\u2019s triumph over Manchester City, when was the last time the team that won the championship beat the Premier League champions in their first meeting of the season?\u201d asks Bill Farnham. It wasn\u2019t so long ago at all. You only have to rewind the clock back to 5 December 2015, when Bournemouth helped bundle Jos\u00e9 Mourinho towards the Chelsea exit door with a 1-0 defeat of his then reigning champions at Stamford Bridge. Twelve days later Mourinho was sacked following a defeat at Leicester. Knowledge archive \u201cDundalk scored after 12 seconds in the League of Ireland \u2026 after their opponents Derry had taken the kick-off,\u201d wrote Sam Alanson in September 2014. \u201cIs this the quickest goal ever scored by a team who didn\u2019t kick-off?\u201d The short answer to this question was, no. But we had several responses from which we permed the following quickfire top four, including the fastest goals in the entire history of the FA Cup, the Champions League and the World Cup: \u2022 9 seconds: Roda v Den Haag, October 2011. \u2022 9 seconds: Reading v West Brom, February 2010. \u2022 10.12 seconds. Bayern Munich v Real Madrid, March 2007. \u2022 10.80 seconds. South Korea v Turkey, July 2002. Can you help? \u201cWith Saturday at 3pm being the traditional kick-off time, which Premier League team has played the least in one season?\u201d asks Roger Kirkby. \u201cA conversation about Aaron Mooy (55.55% vowels) made us wonder which current player in the English top flight has the highest proportion of vowels in their combined first and last names? After much discussion we came up with \u00c9tienne Capoue (61.54% vowels). Are there any current (or past) Premier League players with a higher vowelage rate?\u201d wonders Richard Barnett (28.57%). \u201cManchester City scored five in the first 18 minutes against Watford. Is this a record? Or has a team scored five or more in a European top-flight faster than the first 18 minutes of a match?\u201d muses George Jones. \u201cIn last Thursday\u2019s Europa League, Wolverhampton, Wolfsburg and Wolfsberger FC all played,\u201d writes Maarten Westerveen. \u201cAdd Roma (nicknamed \u2018Wolves\u2019) to it and you have a pack stalking the league. Has there been any been any larger herd/murder/congregation of a single animal in an international competition.\u201d Email your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",

Nasibah and her family were moved to one of the containers 6 months ago and is not happy about the accommodation. A new report from the children\u2019s commissioner for England has said that children growing up in such temporary housing are having their health and wellbeing put at risk.

      "body": "<p>Music is, for most people, a learning curve. The more you write and play, the better you get. Which makes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/18/tegan-and-sara-people-never-talk-about-women-and-drug-use-positively\">Tegan and Sara\u2019s decision</a> to re-record songs they wrote in high school for their new album Hey, I\u2019m Just Like You rather remarkable. Most people would have shunted this stuff out of sight, never to be mentioned again. It\u2019s unfair, of course, to judge an artist on their juvenilia, the music they made before they settled on their eventual course. But it can be enlightening, too \u2013 to see both their immaturity and their precocity, and try to locate threads they would later expand on.</p> <h2>Dr Dre</h2> <p>It\u2019s strange to think of a man who has been a central figure in hip-hop for decades as part of the pack, rather than ahead of it. But long before his solo stardom, before he launched the careers of Eminem and Snoop, before he became the hottest producer in the world, he was wearing shiny suits at the back of the stage, manning the turntables \u2013 and sometimes rapping \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/13/gangsta-rap-history-nwa-ice-cube-dr-dre\">World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru</a>, an electro outfit who were local stars in Compton. Dre even had a theme song, Surgery (\u201cCalling Dr Dre to surgery\u201d), in which he rapped, clunkily: \u201cI\u2019m Dr Dre, gorgeous hunk of a man / Doing tricks on the mix that no others can / The nurses say I\u2019m cute, they say I\u2019m fine / But you better beware \u2019cause I\u2019ll blow your mind.\u201d Except there\u2019s nothing mind-blowing about the Cru\u2019s two albums, World Class (1985) and Rapped in Romance (86). They\u2019re generic electro, already out of date compared with the music coming from the east coast \u2013 Run DMC, LL Cool J, Mantronix, Schoolly D. Dre wouldn\u2019t sound outdated for long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"32793379a2ff18785cd4c542dd1a259b5d1b0f3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32793379a2ff18785cd4c542dd1a259b5d1b0f3c/0_0_4266_4265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bowie circa 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bowie circa 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CA/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>David Bowie</h2> <p>Few artists have offered quite as much juvenilia to the world as Bowie. There was the R&amp;B phase, with the King Bees and the Manish Boys, then his trying-to-be-the-Who phase, with the Lower Third, all of whom made recordings (all perfectly reasonable, and perfectly unremarkable), before he became your actual David Bowie. But not the actual David Bowie the world came to adore. There was freakbeat Bowie (Do Anything You Say), seaside special Bowie (I Dig Everything), before the first Bowie iteration that stuck: whimsical, Anthony Newley-esque David Bowie, who recorded the single The Laughing Gnome, then a self-titled album for Deram. And despite its status as the embarrassing, stunted relative of the Bowie catalogue, it\u2019s actually a pretty good album. It\u2019s very much of its time, but even if it didn\u2019t have Bowie\u2019s name on the cover, there\u2019d be collectors seeking it out as a prime piece of English psych whimsy. Just pretend it\u2019s by someone called Mrs Marmalade\u2019s Tea Party and it sounds wholly charming. And treasure the Kenneth Williams impression on We Are Hungry Men.</p> <h2>Beastie Boys</h2> <p>The Beastie Boys tend to look back in shame on their first hip-hop album, Licensed to Ill, but it wasn\u2019t some sidestep into wilful stupidity. Before becoming a wilfully stupid hip-hop group, they\u2019d been a wilfully stupid teenage hardcore punk band: in his compendious survey American Hardcore, even Steven Blush \u2013 who can compliment almost any hardcore band, no matter how rudimentary \u2013 calls them \u201cpuerile\u201d. Nor were they popular on the scene: Sean Taggart, who designed covers and flyers for hardcore bands, called them \u201ceffete little shits \u2013 a very snotty, elitist bunch\u201d. You can hear their manifest musical inadequacies on the early-years compilation Some Old Bullshit \u2013 which also contains their first, pre-Def Jam attempts at hip-hop, and the pastiche reggae (complete with \u201cJamaican\u201d accents) of Beastie Revolution. There is not one second of this album to suggest they would become one of pop\u2019s best-loved and most-admired groups.</p> <h2>Bj\u00f6rk</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkuXOtFLMZw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nkuXOtFLMZw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s hard to know which piece of Bj\u00f6rk juvenilia to avoid first. In 1977, she became one of the rare future art superstars to make a record while still, unarguably, a child \u2013 I Love to Love was recorded when she was 11, released when she was 12. And if tinny pop, designed to be listened to at the worst disco in the world \u2013 held in a church hall haunted by the smell of vomited-up Fanta and dust undisturbed for decades \u2013 is your bag, then be my guest. There was still a long way to go before adult Bj\u00f6rk arrived. Her warped but melodic new-wave band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/08/northern-souls-the-anarcho-punks-who-made-iceland-a-pop-powerhouse\">Tappi T\u00edkarrass</a> (who released an EP in 1982, and an album in 1983) were often good \u2013 and her voice is already amazing \u2013 but you\u2019ve got to get through KUKL before you get to the Sugarcubes. It\u2019s still music for church halls, but now the smell is patchouli, unwashed fabric and spilt cider, because the kid who threw up the Fanta is now a living in a squat and putting on anti-vivisection benefits.</p> <h2>Katy Perry</h2> <p>Sixteen-year-old Katheryn Hudson was possessed of a belting voice and a faith instilled in her by her deeply religious parents (her mother wouldn\u2019t let her eat Lucky Charms because Lucky sounded too much like \u201cLucifer\u201d). She\u2019d been singing in church since she was nine, so it seemed only natural for her to make a Christian record. Her album Katy Hudson sometimes gets called gospel, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s blandly efficient MOR \u2013 \u201cChristian Contemporary Music\u201d \u2013 differentiated from drivetime radio staples only by the fact that the subject of her passion isn\u2019t a man, but Him Upstairs. You can hear that Perry has something; you can also hear that she was never likely to be constrained by the CCM format, since she always seems to want to be doing more than the songs will allow. A few missteps later, though, and she was kissing a girl, which she apparently liked. Goodness knows what God thought.</p> <h2>Mick Hucknall</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxv1cwwfdr4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pxv1cwwfdr4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI feel like the \u2019unchback of Notre Dame / I\u2019m an ugly sod but it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d The Hunchback of Notre Dame was one of the five tracks in the first session the Frantic Elevators recorded for John Peel, broadcast on 3 March 1981. The gruff voice barking out those lyrics belonged to Mick Hucknall, not yet 21, but already a veteran of Manchester\u2019s punk and post-punk scene (the Elevators formed, as did every other group in Manchester after Herman\u2019s Hermits, fresh from seeing the Sex Pistols at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in June 1976). There\u2019s little in their handful of singles, their pair of Peel sessions or the few pieces of extant film to suggest that anything other than fondly remembered obscurity awaited \u2013 until their final single, written in 1978 but not recorded and released until 1982. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/27/simply-red-how-we-made-holding-back-the-years-mick-hucknall\">Holding Back the Years</a>, suddenly, the fact that there was an extraordinary melodicist and fabulous singer in the band became glaringly apparent.</p> <h2>Bobby Brown</h2> <p>The \u201cMichael Jackson\u201d in Boston\u2019s pre-adolescent answer to the Jackson 5, New Edition, Brown formed the group himself when he was nine, in 1978. They signed to Arthur Baker\u2019s Streetwise Records in 1982, and promptly had a massive hit on both sides of the Atlantic with Candy Girl. Even 37 years later, that single \u2013 on which Brown sang co-lead \u2013 is a delightful piece of bubblegum R&amp;B (albeit one so indebted to the Jacksons that it might have been called DEF). Brown was a troubled kid, though, and got thrown out of the group in 1985 owing to his behaviour. He would never again sound innocent the way he did on his three albums with New Edition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68e0f3d344057c152a2756cca9dd0b0c405e3635\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68e0f3d344057c152a2756cca9dd0b0c405e3635/0_0_3072_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m no disco queen!\u2019 ...

It was, as much as anything, a reaction to the experience of being a teen star, albeit only in Canada. She had made two hit albums \u2013 Alanis and Now Is the Time \u2013 and won several Juno awards. While she co-wrote across both of them, the sense remained of someone being moulded to fit a record label\u2019s idea of what a teenage singer should be: \u201cMy name is Alanis, I\u2019m just 16 / So gimme a break / I\u2019m no disco queen,\u201d she sang on Oh Yeah, from her debut. The first record was dance-pop, the second a little more grown-up (and less successful), and you can hear a voice that is a thousand times better than, say, that of Tiffany or Debbie Gibson; on The Time of Your Life, from Now Is the Time, you can hear the phrasing and delivery of Jagged Little Pill falling into place. But there was darkness to it all. Morrissette later said she was put under such pressure to lose weight that she developed anorexia, and took years to overcome her eating disorders. That confusion would tumble out on Jagged Little Pill.</p> <h2>Marc Bolan</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/18/tegan-and-sara-people-never-talk-about-women-and-drug-use-positively\">Tegan and Sara: \u2018People never talk about women and drug use positively\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like Bowie, Bolan spent much of the 1960s trying to work out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/11/t-rex-the-complete-studio-albums-review\">how to become himself</a>. And, like Bowie, he left behind plenty of recorded evidence of his voyage of self-discovery: The Wizard and the Third Degree are zippy enough; Hippy Gumbo prefigures Tyrannosaurus Rex. But things got interesting when Bolan joined the mod-psych band John\u2019s Children in 1967. His two best-known songs for them \u2013 much celebrated and oft-compiled \u2013 are genuinely brilliant. Midsummer Night\u2019s Scene is both haunted and hammering, the sound of purple hearts and blotter acid at the same time (the style that later got named \u201cfreakbeat\u201d); Desdemona was banned by the BBC for the lyric \u201clift up your skirt and fly\u201d. As Rob Chapman wrote in Psychedelia and Other Colours: \u201cBolan is only let loose at the very end, screaming the chorus line like he has no previous acquaintance with the lyrics or indeed the key he\u2019s supposed to be singing in. He sounds unhinged.\u201d</p> <h2>Neil Young and Rick James</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTE8hKvaaI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tQTE8hKvaaI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Two for the price of one, because the most contrary man in the history of rock music and the future Super Freak shared stages together in the mid-60s as part of the Mynah Birds, the best Toronto R&amp;B/soul band to be signed to Motown, albeit in a field of one. It wasn\u2019t really Young\u2019s metier \u2013 he was already singing folk when roped in to play guitar \u2013 and the band fell apart in 1966 when James was sentenced to five months\u2019 hard labour for going Awol from the US navy (his issues with the navy are a long and fascinating story). Though nothing was released at the time (it emerged later on compilations), the Mynah Birds did get round to recording for Motown before their career was derailed, and the music is worth hearing, for its berserk variety: I\u2019ll Wait Forever is pure folk-rock; I Got You (In My Soul) is stomping garage R&amp;B; It\u2019s My Time, the gem, is beautiful, ecstatic soul, but with a Byrdsy guitar line. What a strange, compelling group they might have become.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Music is, for most people, a learning curve. The more you write and play, the better you get. Which makes Tegan and Sara\u2019s decision to re-record songs they wrote in high school for their new album Hey, I\u2019m Just Like You rather remarkable. Most people would have shunted this stuff out of sight, never to be mentioned again. It\u2019s unfair, of course, to judge an artist on their juvenilia, the music they made before they settled on their eventual course. But it can be enlightening, too \u2013 to see both their immaturity and their precocity, and try to locate threads they would later expand on. Dr Dre It\u2019s strange to think of a man who has been a central figure in hip-hop for decades as part of the pack, rather than ahead of it. But long before his solo stardom, before he launched the careers of Eminem and Snoop, before he became the hottest producer in the world, he was wearing shiny suits at the back of the stage, manning the turntables \u2013 and sometimes rapping \u2013 with World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru, an electro outfit who were local stars in Compton. Dre even had a theme song, Surgery (\u201cCalling Dr Dre to surgery\u201d), in which he rapped, clunkily: \u201cI\u2019m Dr Dre, gorgeous hunk of a man / Doing tricks on the mix that no others can / The nurses say I\u2019m cute, they say I\u2019m fine / But you better beware \u2019cause I\u2019ll blow your mind.\u201d Except there\u2019s nothing mind-blowing about the Cru\u2019s two albums, World Class (1985) and Rapped in Romance (86). They\u2019re generic electro, already out of date compared with the music coming from the east coast \u2013 Run DMC, LL Cool J, Mantronix, Schoolly D. Dre wouldn\u2019t sound outdated for long. David Bowie Few artists have offered quite as much juvenilia to the world as Bowie. There was the R&amp;B phase, with the King Bees and the Manish Boys, then his trying-to-be-the-Who phase, with the Lower Third, all of whom made recordings (all perfectly reasonable, and perfectly unremarkable), before he became your actual David Bowie. But not the actual David Bowie the world came to adore. There was freakbeat Bowie (Do Anything You Say), seaside special Bowie (I Dig Everything), before the first Bowie iteration that stuck: whimsical, Anthony Newley-esque David Bowie, who recorded the single The Laughing Gnome, then a self-titled album for Deram. And despite its status as the embarrassing, stunted relative of the Bowie catalogue, it\u2019s actually a pretty good album. It\u2019s very much of its time, but even if it didn\u2019t have Bowie\u2019s name on the cover, there\u2019d be collectors seeking it out as a prime piece of English psych whimsy. Just pretend it\u2019s by someone called Mrs Marmalade\u2019s Tea Party and it sounds wholly charming. And treasure the Kenneth Williams impression on We Are Hungry Men. Beastie Boys The Beastie Boys tend to look back in shame on their first hip-hop album, Licensed to Ill, but it wasn\u2019t some sidestep into wilful stupidity. Before becoming a wilfully stupid hip-hop group, they\u2019d been a wilfully stupid teenage hardcore punk band: in his compendious survey American Hardcore, even Steven Blush \u2013 who can compliment almost any hardcore band, no matter how rudimentary \u2013 calls them \u201cpuerile\u201d. Nor were they popular on the scene: Sean Taggart, who designed covers and flyers for hardcore bands, called them \u201ceffete little shits \u2013 a very snotty, elitist bunch\u201d. You can hear their manifest musical inadequacies on the early-years compilation Some Old Bullshit \u2013 which also contains their first, pre-Def Jam attempts at hip-hop, and the pastiche reggae (complete with \u201cJamaican\u201d accents) of Beastie Revolution. There is not one second of this album to suggest they would become one of pop\u2019s best-loved and most-admired groups. Bj\u00f6rk It\u2019s hard to know which piece of Bj\u00f6rk juvenilia to avoid first. In 1977, she became one of the rare future art superstars to make a record while still, unarguably, a child \u2013 I Love to Love was recorded when she was 11, released when she was 12. And if tinny pop, designed to be listened to at the worst disco in the world \u2013 held in a church hall haunted by the smell of vomited-up Fanta and dust undisturbed for decades \u2013 is your bag, then be my guest. There was still a long way to go before adult Bj\u00f6rk arrived. Her warped but melodic new-wave band Tappi T\u00edkarrass (who released an EP in 1982, and an album in 1983) were often good \u2013 and her voice is already amazing \u2013 but you\u2019ve got to get through KUKL before you get to the Sugarcubes. It\u2019s still music for church halls, but now the smell is patchouli, unwashed fabric and spilt cider, because the kid who threw up the Fanta is now a living in a squat and putting on anti-vivisection benefits. Katy Perry Sixteen-year-old Katheryn Hudson was possessed of a belting voice and a faith instilled in her by her deeply religious parents (her mother wouldn\u2019t let her eat Lucky Charms because Lucky sounded too much like \u201cLucifer\u201d). She\u2019d been singing in church since she was nine, so it seemed only natural for her to make a Christian record. Her album Katy Hudson sometimes gets called gospel, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s blandly efficient MOR \u2013 \u201cChristian Contemporary Music\u201d \u2013 differentiated from drivetime radio staples only by the fact that the subject of her passion isn\u2019t a man, but Him Upstairs. You can hear that Perry has something; you can also hear that she was never likely to be constrained by the CCM format, since she always seems to want to be doing more than the songs will allow. A few missteps later, though, and she was kissing a girl, which she apparently liked. Goodness knows what God thought. Mick Hucknall \u201cI feel like the \u2019unchback of Notre Dame / I\u2019m an ugly sod but it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d The Hunchback of Notre Dame was one of the five tracks in the first session the Frantic Elevators recorded for John Peel, broadcast on 3 March 1981. The gruff voice barking out those lyrics belonged to Mick Hucknall, not yet 21, but already a veteran of Manchester\u2019s punk and post-punk scene (the Elevators formed, as did every other group in Manchester after Herman\u2019s Hermits, fresh from seeing the Sex Pistols at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in June 1976). There\u2019s little in their handful of singles, their pair of Peel sessions or the few pieces of extant film to suggest that anything other than fondly remembered obscurity awaited \u2013 until their final single, written in 1978 but not recorded and released until 1982. In Holding Back the Years, suddenly, the fact that there was an extraordinary melodicist and fabulous singer in the band became glaringly apparent. Bobby Brown The \u201cMichael Jackson\u201d in Boston\u2019s pre-adolescent answer to the Jackson 5, New Edition, Brown formed the group himself when he was nine, in 1978. They signed to Arthur Baker\u2019s Streetwise Records in 1982, and promptly had a massive hit on both sides of the Atlantic with Candy Girl. Even 37 years later, that single \u2013 on which Brown sang co-lead \u2013 is a delightful piece of bubblegum R&amp;B (albeit one so indebted to the Jacksons that it might have been called DEF). Brown was a troubled kid, though, and got thrown out of the group in 1985 owing to his behaviour. He would never again sound innocent the way he did on his three albums with New Edition. Alanis Morissette Jagged Little Pill in 1995 wasn\u2019t Alanis Morissette\u2019s emergence, fully formed, into the world. It was, as much as anything, a reaction to the experience of being a teen star, albeit only in Canada. She had made two hit albums \u2013 Alanis and Now Is the Time \u2013 and won several Juno awards. While she co-wrote across both of them, the sense remained of someone being moulded to fit a record label\u2019s idea of what a teenage singer should be: \u201cMy name is Alanis, I\u2019m just 16 / So gimme a break / I\u2019m no disco queen,\u201d she sang on Oh Yeah, from her debut.

But there was darkness to it all. Morrissette later said she was put under such pressure to lose weight that she developed anorexia, and took years to overcome her eating disorders. That confusion would tumble out on Jagged Little Pill. Marc Bolan Like Bowie, Bolan spent much of the 1960s trying to work out how to become himself. And, like Bowie, he left behind plenty of recorded evidence of his voyage of self-discovery: The Wizard and the Third Degree are zippy enough; Hippy Gumbo prefigures Tyrannosaurus Rex.

Never before has this been truer than it is now. The Swede\u2019s hat-trick against Sporting KC last week saw him break LA Galaxy\u2019s single-season scoring record, and he now has 27 goals in 26 games. But that still doesn\u2019t do justice to the way Ibrahimovic has affected the narrative in Major League Soccer this season.</p> <p>He has had his say on the league\u2019s playoff format (<a href=\"https://deadspin.com/zlatan-ibrahimovic-on-mls-playoffs-i-think-the-system-1837079212\">which he calls \u201cshit\u201d</a>), the quality of his teammates (<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/zlatan-ibrahimovic-trashes-teammates-and-mls-i-am-like-a-ferrari-among-fiats-211959426.html\">he is \u201ca Ferrari among Fiats,\u201d apparently</a>), his place in the pantheon of great MLS players and the league\u2019s artificial pitches. In typical fashion, there\u2019s very little that Ibrahimovic hasn\u2019t had his say on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/wayne-rooney-dc-united-mls-soccer-derby-county\">Wayne Rooney revived DC United but Europe still clearly trumps MLS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ibrahimovic\u2019s criticism of MLS comes from more than a place of trademark narcissism. Wayne Rooney, the league\u2019s other globally renowned superstar, has also joined his former Manchester United teammate in exposing the league\u2019s flaws, with the DC United forward this week highlighting the gross pay disparity in North American soccer.</p> <p>\u201cI feel that American players get underpaid,\u201d said Rooney <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/dc-united/story/3944171/rooney-says-us-players-in-mls-are-underpaid\">in an interview with ESPN FC</a>. \u201cI feel they deserve to get more money to stay in line with football in the rest of the world but also in terms of the American sports. I\u2019m not saying it to benefit me, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/church-criticises-wayne-rooney-over-derby-gambling-tie-up\">I obviously won\u2019t be in the league next season</a>. I think it\u2019s only fair to those players who are putting in the same work as all have to earn the right to earn more money for doing it.\u201d</p> <p>This comes just a month after Rooney criticized <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/01/mls-flights-commercial-travel-soccer\">the league\u2019s policy on charter flights</a>, with MLS teams only permitted four charter flights per season (a return trip would count as two flights). \u201cGutted about result last night. We deserved more,\u201d he tweeted after an away defeat to the Vancouver Whitecaps last month. \u201cLooking forward to a 12 hour travel day which could be done in six (sic) but hey this is MLS.\u201d</p> <p>Rooney certainly isn\u2019t the only active player to have spoken out against the current charter flight arrangement, but the former England and Manchester United striker has the sort of audience few others in MLS have. In fact, Ibrahimovic is the only figure who can match Rooney for his clout and it feels like both players are fighting for their fellow MLS professionals.</p> <p>MLS\u2019s centralized system has resulted in a culture of unwritten censorship. The league stamps the paychecks of every player, coach and member of staff at every one of MLS\u2019s 24 clubs, and many choose not to bite the hand that feeds. Even in the way the league is covered largely by reporters on the MLS payroll, there is a soft-touch approach.</p> <p>There\u2019s no suggestion that MLS itself actively enforces this culture. It is a by-product of North American soccer\u2019s structure. But this is why it\u2019s so important that the likes of Ibrahimovic and Rooney, figures with the status to be heard and quality not to be cut from the roster for causing a fuss, continue to offer their colleagues a voice. They don\u2019t have as much to lose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/01/mls-flights-commercial-travel-soccer\">Window or aisle, Zlatan? Why MLS teams still fly commercial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ibrahimovic and Rooney\u2019s comments are particularly pertinent due to the looming collective bargaining agreement discussions in MLS. The current CBA deal expires on 31 January 2020 and so the league and the Major League Soccer Players Union (MLSPA) will sit down soon to start official negotiations after two years of informal talks. Many of the hot button topics have been hit by Ibrahimovic and Rooney of late. That\u2019s unlikely to be a coincidence.</p> <p>Indeed, a number of players have changed their social media avatars to a graphic declaring \u201cI Am The MLSPA\u201d. This is about much more than just Ibrahimovic and Rooney taking on MLS HQ to keep themselves amused. Alejandro Bedoya and DaMarcus Beasley have also made themselves heard on a number of issues, with the latter taking aim at the format of the MLS season. \u201cNo disrespect to MLS, but when you lose a game and you don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s like \u2018Eh,\u2019\u201d said the Houston Dynamo veteran. \u201cFor MLS, making the playoffs is the threshold. That\u2019s where the line is. Really? That\u2019s how it is. It shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d</p> <p>Increasingly, it seems that MLS is at a pivotal point of its recent history. Off the field, the league continues to grapple with the implementation of its new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/21/mls-and-antifa-americas-top-flight-grapples-with-political-signage-ban\">political signage ban</a>, with the discourse over what makes something \u2018political\u2019 causing strife. Regarding on the field matters, discussion over the salary cap, the Designated Player rule and the general format of MLS has never before been so highly charged.</p> <p>If fundamental change does occur in MLS, the pressure from Ibrahimovic and Rooney will have played a part. Not all superstar Designated Players would feel such a sense of responsibility for a league that will likely be no more than a footnote on their shimmering resumes once they call it a day. Their impact on North American soccer won\u2019t just be quantified by the number of goals they scored.</p>",

The Swede\u2019s hat-trick against Sporting KC last week saw him break LA Galaxy\u2019s single-season scoring record, and he now has 27 goals in 26 games. But that still doesn\u2019t do justice to the way Ibrahimovic has affected the narrative in Major League Soccer this season. He has had his say on the league\u2019s playoff format (which he calls \u201cshit\u201d), the quality of his teammates (he is \u201ca Ferrari among Fiats,\u201d apparently), his place in the pantheon of great MLS players and the league\u2019s artificial pitches. In typical fashion, there\u2019s very little that Ibrahimovic hasn\u2019t had his say on. Ibrahimovic\u2019s criticism of MLS comes from more than a place of trademark narcissism. Wayne Rooney, the league\u2019s other globally renowned superstar, has also joined his former Manchester United teammate in exposing the league\u2019s flaws, with the DC United forward this week highlighting the gross pay disparity in North American soccer. \u201cI feel that American players get underpaid,\u201d said Rooney in an interview with ESPN FC. \u201cI feel they deserve to get more money to stay in line with football in the rest of the world but also in terms of the American sports. I\u2019m not saying it to benefit me, I obviously won\u2019t be in the league next season. I think it\u2019s only fair to those players who are putting in the same work as all have to earn the right to earn more money for doing it.\u201d This comes just a month after Rooney criticized the league\u2019s policy on charter flights, with MLS teams only permitted four charter flights per season (a return trip would count as two flights). \u201cGutted about result last night. We deserved more,\u201d he tweeted after an away defeat to the Vancouver Whitecaps last month. \u201cLooking forward to a 12 hour travel day which could be done in six (sic) but hey this is MLS.\u201d Rooney certainly isn\u2019t the only active player to have spoken out against the current charter flight arrangement, but the former England and Manchester United striker has the sort of audience few others in MLS have. In fact, Ibrahimovic is the only figure who can match Rooney for his clout and it feels like both players are fighting for their fellow MLS professionals. MLS\u2019s centralized system has resulted in a culture of unwritten censorship. The league stamps the paychecks of every player, coach and member of staff at every one of MLS\u2019s 24 clubs, and many choose not to bite the hand that feeds. Even in the way the league is covered largely by reporters on the MLS payroll, there is a soft-touch approach. There\u2019s no suggestion that MLS itself actively enforces this culture. It is a by-product of North American soccer\u2019s structure. But this is why it\u2019s so important that the likes of Ibrahimovic and Rooney, figures with the status to be heard and quality not to be cut from the roster for causing a fuss, continue to offer their colleagues a voice. They don\u2019t have as much to lose. Ibrahimovic and Rooney\u2019s comments are particularly pertinent due to the looming collective bargaining agreement discussions in MLS. The current CBA deal expires on 31 January 2020 and so the league and the Major League Soccer Players Union (MLSPA) will sit down soon to start official negotiations after two years of informal talks. Many of the hot button topics have been hit by Ibrahimovic and Rooney of late. That\u2019s unlikely to be a coincidence. Indeed, a number of players have changed their social media avatars to a graphic declaring \u201cI Am The MLSPA\u201d. This is about much more than just Ibrahimovic and Rooney taking on MLS HQ to keep themselves amused. Alejandro Bedoya and DaMarcus Beasley have also made themselves heard on a number of issues, with the latter taking aim at the format of the MLS season. \u201cNo disrespect to MLS, but when you lose a game and you don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s like \u2018Eh,\u2019\u201d said the Houston Dynamo veteran. \u201cFor MLS, making the playoffs is the threshold. That\u2019s where the line is. Really? That\u2019s how it is. It shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d Increasingly, it seems that MLS is at a pivotal point of its recent history. Off the field, the league continues to grapple with the implementation of its new political signage ban, with the discourse over what makes something \u2018political\u2019 causing strife. Regarding on the field matters, discussion over the salary cap, the Designated Player rule and the general format of MLS has never before been so highly charged. If fundamental change does occur in MLS, the pressure from Ibrahimovic and Rooney will have played a part. Not all superstar Designated Players would feel such a sense of responsibility for a league that will likely be no more than a footnote on their shimmering resumes once they call it a day. Their impact on North American soccer won\u2019t just be quantified by the number of goals they scored.",

They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the court had the right to act</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That parliament has not been prorogued</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d</p>\n    <p><i>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf\">full judgment</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-summary.pdf\">summary judgment</a> can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Parliament will reconvene at 11.30am on Wednesday, with all parties whipping their MPs to be there.</p> \n<p>Opposition parties are likely to start making moves to hold the government to account through motions that would seek to gain control of the Commons order paper and possibly a motion or humble address to get publication of the attorney general\u2019s legal advice on prorogation.</p> \n<p>The government will shortly want to table a motion to secure a short recess for the Tory party conference but the vote may be lost by the government as Johnson no longer has a majority.</p> \n<p>Corbyn said Labour would vote against parliament breaking up again at such a crucial time for Brexit.</p> \n<p><br></p>",

The Labour leader said the prime minister had abused the powers he has of the use of the royal prerogative and this was a very, very serious matter. Speaking on the BBC Today programme, Corbyn said it should have been obvious that it was a \u201cpretty risky\u201d decision to suspend parliament and reiterated his call for Johnson to resign. \u201cI think he should apologise to her [the Queen] for the advice he gave her and more importantly he should apologise to the British people for what he has done in trying to shut down our democracy at a crucial time when people are worried about what will happen on 31 October,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks to the supreme court, we now have parliament meeting again today and we will once again be able to question the government in what it is actually doing in taking us out of the EU without a deal, with all the damage that will do to people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods,\u201d he added. Despite his calls for Johnson to resign, Corbyn said he would only move to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister when it was clear that a no-deal Brexit was off the table. \u201cQuite simply our first priority is to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October,\u201d he said. Michael Gove, the minister responsible for no-deal planning, took a defiant tone on the judgment on Tuesday morning, saying he respected the supreme court ruling but did not agree with it. Asked whether the government had been wrong to prorogue parliament, Gove said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the government should apologise for having a strong domestic agenda or seeking to ring about or exit from the European Union,\u201d he added. Gove also denied widespread reports that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, had in cabinet criticised the judgment as a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d, saying he did not recognise that language. Elsewhere, the government was sending mixed messages on its response to the judgment, with a senior No 10 source briefing the view that judges had made a mistake, while Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, called for the independence of the judges to be respected. Parliament will reconvene at 11.30am on Wednesday, with all parties whipping their MPs to be there. Opposition parties are likely to start making moves to hold the government to account through motions that would seek to gain control of the Commons order paper and possibly a motion or humble address to get publication of the attorney general\u2019s legal advice on prorogation. The government will shortly want to table a motion to secure a short recess for the Tory party conference but the vote may be lost by the government as Johnson no longer has a majority. Corbyn said Labour would vote against parliament breaking up again at such a crucial time for Brexit.",

      "body": "<p>It could have been an entirely different story, one so ordinary in its violent diminishment of a woman. The script is well-worn. An assault at a student party; a disorienting walk through hospital clinics and police stations; panic attacks; a forensic examination of your character. How much did you drink? Why did you go to that party? Did you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend? You react by receding further into yourself. Perhaps you drop the charges; perhaps the judge is lenient. Your assailant soon gets on with his life, free to walk the halls of power. Trust the system, you were told.</p> <p>But sometimes there are facts that bring you closer to something resembling justice. For a 22-year-old recent university graduate known to the world as \u201cEmily Doe\u201d, there were a few. Fact: Brock Turner, the man who assaults her behind a fraternity house skip in January 2015, is a Stanford University student and swimmer. Spiralling media attention in what is deemed the \u201cStanford swimmer case\u201d means her rape forensic evidence kit receives expedited processing, thus avoiding, she later relates, the fate of a hundred others collecting dust in a slow-moving backlog. Fact: there are two witnesses to the assault, male graduate students who happen to be cycling past. They chase Turner away, and testify in Doe\u2019s favour. Fact: after Turner is found guilty on three felony counts in March 2016, Doe, now 23, writes a powerful 7,000-word letter addressed to her attacker that she reads aloud at his sentencing. It is published on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/buzzfeed\" title=\"\">Buzz</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/buzzfeed\" title=\"\">Feed </a>in June and goes viral, receiving 15m views within a week.</p> <p>The letter is read aloud by congresswomen in the House of Representatives and, in response, California\u2019s laws for sexual assault are amended to support future victims. Its opening line is often cited: \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d When I first read it, I was also haunted by two other lines: \u201cSometimes I think, if I hadn\u2019t gone, then this never would\u2019ve happened. But then I realised it would have happened, just to somebody else.\u201d What a strange world it is in which 23-year-olds are reflecting on the randomness of the cruelty inflicted on them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ecdcbf7a551957af865a21db8eefc5e230c0dad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ecdcbf7a551957af865a21db8eefc5e230c0dad/0_120_3957_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brock Turner leaves the Santa Clara County Main Jail in San Jose, California, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brock Turner leaves the Santa Clara County Main Jail in San Jose, California, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Honda/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month, \u201cEmily Doe\u201d revealed herself to be Chanel Miller, a half-Chinese artist and writer from California. Miller, now 27, looks back at her high-profile sexual assault case in <em>Know My Name</em>. In the three years since the sentencing, she has gathered court transcripts and witness testimonies withheld from her during the case, which inform her memoir. The book blends Miller\u2019s meditations on her life over the past few years with a discussion of the institutions that handle sexual assault cases: the police, the courts, and, in this instance, the university. Courtroom interrogations, ostensibly seeking objective facts, become contests over whose narrative draws the most sympathy. University administrators offer, then withdraw, their support in the face of potential litigation. The neutral faces of institutions, her story shows, so easily slip to reveal highly subjective battles over whose pain counts for what.</p> <p>The title of the book denotes declarative self-affirmation, something constantly denied to Miller after she woke up at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Centre in January 2015 with a police deputy and Stanford dean at her bedside. The last thing she remembers is stepping outside the fraternity house with her sister the night before. From then on, her life no longer feels like it is hers. In a daze at the medical centre, she is told there is reason to believe she has been assaulted and signs a stack of papers consenting to an immediate examination. Ten days later, on coming across an article online at work, she learns the full story of what happened to her. She reads of Turner\u2019s life as an \u201cOlympic hopeful\u201d and discovers she is referred to as an \u201cunconscious woman\u201d. This dynamic will carry over into the courtroom, where, she relates, Turner\u2019s ambitions, past accomplishments and present pain are magnified in testimonies from swimming coaches and ex-girlfriends. She, on the other hand, becomes a woman who failed to adequately protect herself against the natural lechery of the world that night in January, her use of alcohol thoroughly questioned. \u201cHis history included his childhood, education, summer jobs, sweet relationships,\u201d she writes. \u201cMy history was blackouts one through five.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Know My Name stands unapologetically large, asking others to reckon with its author\u2019s dazzling, undiminishable presence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book unveils what those on the outside can\u2019t see. Miller recalls the repeated postponement of her trials, which leaves her schedule agonisingly beholden to someone else\u2019s whims; her recurrent feelings of panic and dread that emerge long after the attack; the rebuilding of her life, as she takes art classes and joins comedy troupes to recover a sense of self. In the midst of all this, she navigates a byzantine legal system, often having to sit in the same courtroom as her attacker. One of the many lessons that comes across is how sexual assault victims need greater guidance through these worlds. When Miller agrees to press charges against Turner, she does so casually over the phone to a detective, right after she is discharged from the hospital. She does not realise what that will entail, thinking it to be the \u201cequivalent to signing a petition\u201d. A year and a half later, Miller is talking to a probation officer about Turner\u2019s sentencing and confuses jail with prison (jail typically holds people awaiting trial or serving short sentences while those in prison tend to be serving longer sentences for more severe offences). She is sure that the officer twists her meaning, playing down the anguish in her testimony to recommend a short county jail sentence for Turner.</p> <p>When it was published in 2016, Miller\u2019s letter stunned readers with the clarity of her voice, acuity of her rage and expansiveness of her empathy towards those in need of support. Her story offered other victims a shared language; Miller recalls receiving thousands of supportive letters from women recounting their own stories. Her memoir has this same mix of the intimate with the communal, placing her own pain against a backdrop of shared suffering. At the end of Turner\u2019s sentencing, she feels as if she has climbed a high mountain of justice, a climb that many fellow victims have not been able to scale. Exhausted, she imagines looking down, \u201cwhere I imagined expectant victims looking up, waving, cheering, expectantly \u2026 What could I tell them? The system does not exist for you.\u201d Against a system that leads victims to recede into their own spheres of private suffering, <em>Know My Name</em> creates a space where this pain can sit and receive support from others.</p> <p>The last few chapters discuss the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> movement and its landmark moments: the Harvey Weinstein revelations; the US gymnastics case; Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/17/will-brett-kavanaugh-be-impeached-dont-hold-your-breath\" title=\"\">Brett Kavanaugh</a> hearings. When listening to women tell their stories, Miller stresses, it is important to let them sit with their hurt and anger and resist the urge to pre-emptively tie up their suffering with a bow through platitudes of courage. There is a final irony in how Stanford University, after agreeing to mount a plaque memorialising her story on campus, proposed as the inscribed quote: \u201cI\u2019m right here, I\u2019m okay. Everything\u2019s okay, I\u2019m right here.\u201d (Stanford had rejected Miller\u2019s suggestions, finding them too emotionally charged.) These were the words, she tells us, she told her sister after being released from the hospital, hiding her own panic for her sister\u2019s comfort. Even after cases are concluded, the pain of victims is diminished by the false friend of commemorating one\u2019s bravery. In a world that asks too many survivors to keep their experiences to themselves and shrink their suffering to preserve someone else\u2019s potential, <em>Know My Name</em> stands unapologetically large, asking others to reckon with its author\u2019s dazzling, undiminishable presence.

Newcastle medical bods have taken a good look at Andy Carroll\u2019s ankle and have determined that it may well be the eighth wonder of the world. They also reckon he won\u2019t be able to start a game for Steve Bruce\u2019s struggling side until Christmas. It\u2019s the reason scouts have been told to keep a keen eye on Sevilla\u2019s former Manchester City trainee Rony Lopes, who the Spanish side are happy to let go in the winter transfer window. The attacking midfielder cost \u00a322.5m in August but new manager Julen Lopetegui has taken just a month to come to the conclusion that his face doesn\u2019t fit. After watching his Tottenham side get dumped out of the Carabao Cup by mighty Colchester, Mauricio Pochettino reckons he can fix everything by spending some cash. \u201cJanuary is going to be a good opportunity too to fix this situation and the next one,\u201d said the Spurs manager. We\u2019ll wager Daniel Levy thinks differently. Southend are not likely to name Henrik Larsson as manager after taking a cursory glance at his underwhelming managerial career to date. And if anyone cares about who might be the manager of a club in north America that has not even played a game in anger yet then this one\u2019s for you. Santiago Solari could be named Inter Miami boss if David Beckham gets his way. Excited?",

      "bodyText": "The sacked Wallabies player Israel Folau conceded at a tribunal hearing he had breached his Rugby Australia contract and offered to issue an apology following the termination of his employment earlier this year, according to court documents filed by Rugby Australia. Folau\u2019s contract was ripped up after he posted anti-gay sentiments on social media in April which were deemed to be in breach of RA\u2019s code of conduct. The 30-year-old launched legal proceedings against RA and is seeking damages worth $10m, an apology and reinstatement. He has not played rugby union since being sacked and is currently seeking a return to sport with the Tongan national rugby league team. In documents filed in the federal circuit court, RA alleges that \u201cMr Folau, through his senior counsel, conceded that his conduct in making the 2019 Posts constituted a breach of [the rules]\u201d and \u201coffered to make a public apology for the 2019 Posts\u201d. \u201cBefore the Tribunal, Mr Folau conceded that his posts had breached the Code of Conduct, conceded that the posts had the potential to cause damage to Rugby Australia\u2019s relationship with sponsors, and conceded that he knew, at the time of posting, that transgender and homosexual persons may have been offended by the posts,\u201d RA says in court documents. \u201cDespite his concession that the posts breached the Code of Conduct, Mr Folau refused to take down the posts.\u201d \u201cRemarkably, despite his concession before the Tribunal that he had breached the Code of Conduct, Mr Folau now seeks to argue that his posts did not breach the Code of Conduct,\u201d RA later says in the documents. RA says in its documents Folau was \u201cthe highest paid, and one of the highest profile, players in Australia\u201d and that his contract required him to be \u201can ambassador for the game of rugby in Australia\u201d. It claimed Folau had accepted his views were likely to make sponsors feel \u201cvery uneasy\u201d. In Folau\u2019s statement of claim, filed in August, the rugby star said he had suffered \u201closs and damage\u201d over his sacking, which he argues was unlawful. Folau accuses RA of sacking him for his religion and political views and demands that he is reinstated. \u201c\u2026 Mr Folau can no longer play rugby union at an international level (because he is only eligible to play for the Wallabies) or for an Australian team in the Super Rugby competition and [the sanction] is therefore an unreasonable restraint of trade, contrary to public policy, and void,\u201d the document says. The legal action comes as Folau\u2019s playing future continues to be shrouded in mystery, after reports he will line up for Tonga in rugby league tests against Australia and Great Britain were denied by the sport\u2019s international governing body.",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a question mark stalking EA\u2019s football series with the unshakeable tenacity of Fabio Cannavaro in his prime. While Fifa 20 is mostly very good, the issue of card-purchased loot boxes in its most popular mode, Ultimate Team, has led to calls for the game to be classified as gambling.</p> <p>A recap, for those unaware of the brouhaha: in Ultimate Team, you build a fantasy squad by opening loot box-style packs of individual player cards. You can use in-game currency to buy these packs, or do so using real money \u2013 but the chances of finding Messi, Ronaldo or Salah are \u2026 well, we don\u2019t know, because <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/news/fifa-pack-probabilities?utm_campaign=fifa19_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_pack-probabilities-tw&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=48860&amp;ts=1569271848171?utm_campaign=fifa19_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_pack-probabilities-tw&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=48860&amp;ts=1569271848171\">EA doesn\u2019t disclose unambiguous odds</a>. There\u2019s your first problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bf73033fa01e0843b2cc4b8276a3d59dbe60090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf73033fa01e0843b2cc4b8276a3d59dbe60090/83_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fifa 20\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keen to deliver big, memorable moments \u2026 Fifa 20.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electronic Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second is that this is a family-rated game, with teenagers around the globe spending money they don\u2019t necessarily have chasing cards they\u2019ll likely never get. In Belgium <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/news/fifa-points-belgium\">cash sales ceased in January</a>, but elsewhere it\u2019s business as usual. Some plan to boycott until EA makes pack odds clearer or implements an age rating, as neither is present here.</p> <p>The issue isn\u2019t all weighted one way. For those disciplined enough to avoid micro-transactions, Ultimate Team remains the best mode in all of sports gaming. Squad building challenges \u2013 in which you complete puzzles to earn superior cards \u2013 rely on skill rather than luck, and savvy use of the transfer market earns top players without spending a penny. A new XP system, where everything you do builds towards rewards such as Wilfried Zaha or Lucas V\u00e1zquez, also eliminates fortune from the equation.</p> <p>Plus, for anyone weaned on Panini collections, opening packs is the most euphoric part: to remove any chance of randomly unearthing last season\u2019s top scorer or your club\u2019s cult hero would be to disarm the mode\u2019s magic. Change seems inescapable, but an age gate feels like a more balanced compromise. Finishing your album never felt quite so fun when ordering specific stickers direct from the manufacturer.</p> <p>Judge Fifa for its on-field abilities and you discover a football sim keen to deliver big, memorable moments: crazy, mazy dribbles and thunderbolts arrowed into the top corner. Defending is difficult, and 0-0 draws as rare as a VAR-free Match Of The Day episode. There\u2019s no attempt to match PES 2020\u2019s cerebral passing game: Fifa 20 is all-action all the time. It won\u2019t suit purists, but the just-one-more-game pull at 11pm when you have work/college/school the next day is gravity-strong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b766a81b50360e35159bdb71debdce9cfa229d2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b766a81b50360e35159bdb71debdce9cfa229d2e/631_0_6369_3822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outrageous and hilarious \u2026 Fifa 20\u2019s new Volta mode.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outrageous and hilarious \u2026 Fifa 20\u2019s new Volta mode.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electronic Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is particularly true of Volta mode. Inspired by fan requests to exhume the Fifa Street series, it enables teams of six or fewer players to do battle in small arenas based on real locations. And it\u2019s superb. Claustrophobic pitches prevent pace being overpowered, and passing and shooting are reassuringly snappy \u2013 while skill moves are equal parts outrageous and hilarious.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a question mark stalking EA\u2019s football series with the unshakeable tenacity of Fabio Cannavaro in his prime. While Fifa 20 is mostly very good, the issue of card-purchased loot boxes in its most popular mode, Ultimate Team, has led to calls for the game to be classified as gambling. A recap, for those unaware of the brouhaha: in Ultimate Team, you build a fantasy squad by opening loot box-style packs of individual player cards. You can use in-game currency to buy these packs, or do so using real money \u2013 but the chances of finding Messi, Ronaldo or Salah are \u2026 well, we don\u2019t know, because EA doesn\u2019t disclose unambiguous odds. There\u2019s your first problem. The second is that this is a family-rated game, with teenagers around the globe spending money they don\u2019t necessarily have chasing cards they\u2019ll likely never get. In Belgium cash sales ceased in January, but elsewhere it\u2019s business as usual. Some plan to boycott until EA makes pack odds clearer or implements an age rating, as neither is present here. The issue isn\u2019t all weighted one way. For those disciplined enough to avoid micro-transactions, Ultimate Team remains the best mode in all of sports gaming. Squad building challenges \u2013 in which you complete puzzles to earn superior cards \u2013 rely on skill rather than luck, and savvy use of the transfer market earns top players without spending a penny. A new XP system, where everything you do builds towards rewards such as Wilfried Zaha or Lucas V\u00e1zquez, also eliminates fortune from the equation. Plus, for anyone weaned on Panini collections, opening packs is the most euphoric part: to remove any chance of randomly unearthing last season\u2019s top scorer or your club\u2019s cult hero would be to disarm the mode\u2019s magic. Change seems inescapable, but an age gate feels like a more balanced compromise. Finishing your album never felt quite so fun when ordering specific stickers direct from the manufacturer. Judge Fifa for its on-field abilities and you discover a football sim keen to deliver big, memorable moments: crazy, mazy dribbles and thunderbolts arrowed into the top corner. Defending is difficult, and 0-0 draws as rare as a VAR-free Match Of The Day episode. There\u2019s no attempt to match PES 2020\u2019s cerebral passing game: Fifa 20 is all-action all the time. It won\u2019t suit purists, but the just-one-more-game pull at 11pm when you have work/college/school the next day is gravity-strong. This is particularly true of Volta mode. Inspired by fan requests to exhume the Fifa Street series, it enables teams of six or fewer players to do battle in small arenas based on real locations. And it\u2019s superb. Claustrophobic pitches prevent pace being overpowered, and passing and shooting are reassuringly snappy \u2013 while skill moves are equal parts outrageous and hilarious. You\u2019ll chuckle at some of the celebrations, too. When was the last time a Fifa game successfully delivered humour? Volta is best enjoyed using real-world teams, but its bespoke story mode also hosts light-hearted build-a-player amusement, albeit without the subtle performances that made Alex Hunter\u2019s The Journey tale so likeable across Fifas 17 to 19. That, sadly, is gone \u2013 though some of its best elements now inform career mode. For much of Fifa\u2019s history, career mode was the series\u2019 focus, yet this decade it\u2019s taken on the mantle of sacrificial lamb to Ultimate Team\u2019s more immediate dream-team thrills. As such any kind of upgrade is welcome, and being able to converse interactively with squad members and the press \u2013 as occurred in The Journey \u2013 does break up the match-match-match grind.

Ajeigbe decided that a partial answer lay in the voluntary sector. A year ago, he agreed to head up the Abuja section of Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (Mani), a burgeoning user-led organisation fast emerging as a multi-pronged solution to Nigeria\u2019s mental health crisis.</p> \n<p>Mani was launched in 2016 by Victor Ugo, a then medical student from Lagos who had suffered from depression, as a response to the lack of mental health support in Nigeria, where an estimated 7 million people have the same condition.</p> \n<p>Ugo\u2019s vision was to drive change by raising awareness and dispelling stigmas that exist around mental health issues in Nigeria. And on Wednesday, he will appear at the annual <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/goalkeepers/\">Goalkeepers event on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York</a>, to make the case for more funding and fairer treatment for mental health.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you have depression,\u201d says Latifah Yusuf Ojomo, the deputy head of Mani\u2019s Lagos team, \u201cpeople can cast you as mad, which means that the majority of people who have mental health issues in Nigeria do not understand, or want to accept what they are feeling.\u201d</p> \n<p>From the outset, Ugo decided that if Mani was to have any significant impact it would need to focus attention on the country\u2019s most populous demographic. \u201cYoung people [in Nigeria] are much more open to learning new things,\u201d explains Ugo, \u201cthey are much more focused on ways to change.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mani needed a \u201ccool factor\u201d, something Ugo says was sorely lacking in the mental health sector: \u201cSymposiums, that was all that was happening with mental health in Nigeria, just more and more symposiums, people would give a lecture saying we need to increase awareness, but nothing was happening.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ugo and a small band of medical students took to social media, sharing stories and launching online campaigns. Then in October 2017 they hosted their first event, not a symposium as Ugo is keen to point out, but a food fair: \u201cWe just said come and you can taste different delicacies, play games and talk about mental health in a cool way.\u201d</p> \n<p>The event was a huge success, and evolved into a series of monthly workshops focused on topics such as depression and anxiety. As Mani continued to grow in numbers, these meet-ups became known as \u201cconversation cafes\u201d, held in restaurants, parks and cafes, and eventually spreading to cities all over Nigeria, including Abuja and Ibadan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e136c0659a7d4c554221b7c866e4bb4fb75c3253\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e136c0659a7d4c554221b7c866e4bb4fb75c3253/102_0_3060_1836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mani now conducts workshops in schools in Lagos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mani now conducts workshops in schools in Lagos.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mani</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Each month, a different topic is selected \u2013 childhood trauma, the benefits of mindfulness, relationship strains, the reactionary attitudes of the \u201cvillage\u201d \u2013 a case study is presented and discussion groups form.</p> \n<p>Two years later, Mani is now a leading voice on mental health issues in the country, with more than 1,500 volunteers and active in 13 of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states. Ugo is still taken aback by what the project has achieved. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know we were going to end up here; in fact, I feel like we have been a hundred times more successful than we expected at the start.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite the initial success, Ugo knew that still more needed to be done. \u201cWe thought if we don\u2019t balance this with some kind of help, we will cause more harm than good.\u201d So, in 2017, Mani launched a 24-hour mental health support service to run alongside its awareness campaigns. The service allowed people to reach out over WhatsApp or Twitter for emergency help in the form of advice, counselling and supportive listening. An emergency response team was also created via a network of volunteer counsellors. Mani also launched a confidential 24-hour suicide hotline. Attempted suicide is a criminal offence in Nigeria, punishable by up to one year in prison.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

It also leaves Mani with a limited pool of professionals to recruit. As a solution to this, Mani launched a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d system in which mental health professionals educate volunteers in subjects such as active assistance and safe talk (a programme that teaches participants to recognise and engage individuals who may be a suicide risk). Ajeigbe explains: \u201cWhat we do is train people in fundamental mental health skills, so if I train 10 people, they can in turn reach 100 people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mani\u2019s volunteers come from a diverse range of backgrounds. Alle Ayodele, the head of the organisation\u2019s Oyo state chapter, was studying microbiology when he decided to volunteer for Mani after coming across its support team on Twitter. He had been impressed by its speed and professionalism in responding to a series of suicide notes that were trending: \u201cMani took them really seriously, as soon as someone posted a note they stepped in.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ekene Okeke, from Lagos, has a background in sociology and criminology. After suffering from depression and connecting with Mani on Twitter, she decided to volunteer for it. Okeke was recently called out on an emergency where a woman had high levels of anxiety and had been alone for several days. \u201cI dropped what I was doing, and spent hours talking with her, I even went and bought her ice-cream.\u201d It\u2019s moments like this, Okeke says, that make volunteering so rewarding: \u201cIn the end, the woman was able to calm down and has since reached out for help.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/women-healing-rifts-central-african-republic\">The female bakers healing rifts in Central African Republic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Informal mental health support networks like this are becoming more prevalent around the world, as people realise that health systems cannot cope with mental illness, and that society will have to come up with other strategies.

It is already being dubbed as \u201cDavos with the poor\u201d.</p> <p>Social entrepreneur Kennedy Odede, who was raised in the slum of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/kibera-living-in-the-slum\">Kibera</a>, in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, has founded the event to bring world leaders and policymakers together to \u201cchange the dynamic\u201d of the way the big global issues are discussed. He said it was about making \u201cworlds collide\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is high time that the policymakers come to us, the people and the communities who are doing great work on the ground,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cMeetings like Davos are all very well, to bring together world leaders, but there is no space for them to interact with the poor and with people doing the work in the communities. So this forum will fill this gap.\u201d</p> <p>The forum is designed to tackle world poverty by reversing the often unequal power dynamics of development conferences, and will take place in January. It will be that rare example, said Odede, of a conference choosing its location to give a real voice to the poorest in finding solutions to their own problems.</p> <p>\u201cWe will have a 50/50 split of influential leaders and of community leaders from Kibera, from Africa, from India, from Brazil, who have been left out of the conversations for too long.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not about people helicoptering in. They will come with humility, they will come in as our guest and we will showcase all the things people in Kibera can teach the world,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is meant to be a learning journey \u2013 what is working, what is not working.

      "bodyText": "A global conference on poverty is to take place in Africa\u2019s largest slum in an effort to make sure the poorest get a voice. The inaugural World Poverty Forum will be announced on Wednesday in New York at the Decade of Action event taking place during UN general assembly week. It is already being dubbed as \u201cDavos with the poor\u201d. Social entrepreneur Kennedy Odede, who was raised in the slum of Kibera, in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, has founded the event to bring world leaders and policymakers together to \u201cchange the dynamic\u201d of the way the big global issues are discussed. He said it was about making \u201cworlds collide\u201d. \u201cIt is high time that the policymakers come to us, the people and the communities who are doing great work on the ground,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cMeetings like Davos are all very well, to bring together world leaders, but there is no space for them to interact with the poor and with people doing the work in the communities. So this forum will fill this gap.\u201d The forum is designed to tackle world poverty by reversing the often unequal power dynamics of development conferences, and will take place in January. It will be that rare example, said Odede, of a conference choosing its location to give a real voice to the poorest in finding solutions to their own problems. \u201cWe will have a 50/50 split of influential leaders and of community leaders from Kibera, from Africa, from India, from Brazil, who have been left out of the conversations for too long. \u201cThis is not about people helicoptering in. They will come with humility, they will come in as our guest and we will showcase all the things people in Kibera can teach the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is meant to be a learning journey \u2013 what is working, what is not working. We can learn from each other when the community get a voice. \u201cPeople on the frontline must be included. They have to have a place at the table. \u201cThey have been left out of the decisions made about them. Why? Because it\u2019s all been about top to bottom. Now it has to be about bottom to top, because inequality is growing too much. We need to fight this. \u201cI\u2019m so excited. This is for me a big step. We will be a bridge between real people and policymakers.\u201d WPF will be one of the first events in next year\u2019s plans to accelerate progress towards meeting the sustainable development goals, which are being widely criticised at the UNGA this week as being off course and unlikely to be met by the 2030 target. Odede, who is also the co-founder of Shofco, an organisation working in urban slums, said: \u201cIt is sometimes forgotten that any programme to improve lives can only be successful it if works with the grain of individuals \u2013 and the bundles of talent, hope and fear that make up their unique experiences. We will bring leaders to a place where they can feel both the unforgiving reality of poverty alongside the hope that an institution like Shofco can create. \u201cThe World Poverty Forum will spark new ideas through worlds colliding, bringing together leading politicians, CEOs, NGOs, entrepreneurs and thinkers, with those who are making things happen on the frontline, in the thick of the community \u2013 rather than in a western five-star hotel. \u201cWe want to reverse the usual power dynamics of development conferences and release the energies that genuine collaboration can bring.\u201d A two-day programme will focus on practical solutions to the issues of health, education, conflict and climate crisis that keep people entrenched in poverty.

It will also celebrate pioneers in the global fight against poverty \u2013 from individuals and tech startups to NGOs and corporations \u2013 with the launch of the first Kibera Awards. The event will hire local photographers, video crews, caterers and musicians and hold the daytime events in the Shofco school inside Kibera. The contribution of local people\u2019s talents is intended as a reminder to delegates that there are rich pools of skill, flair and inventiveness in the world\u2019s poorest communities. More than 700 million people \u2013 10% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 live in extreme poverty \u2013 defined as earning less than $1.90 a day. While many regions are making good progress with poverty reduction, almost all of Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, is off-track for ending extreme poverty. It is predicted 13 African countries will see an increase in the absolute numbers of extreme poor between now and 2030.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The latest report only provides top line figures where past iterations have included breakdowns by welfare payment, age and employment service program. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert described the report as \u201cabysmal\u201d. \u201cThere have been millions of occasions where payments have been suspended or cancelled and I think it is highly likely that many people were not at fault \u2013 but the government won\u2019t release the full picture,\u201d she said. This month, the government provided a briefing note to a few media outlets with selected figures showing the number of people who had their payments temporarily cut for reasons such as missing a job interview. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said in the subsequent media coverage that the figures showed jobseekers were not taking their obligations seriously. But those figures, included in previous official reports, were not provided in the new report. Nicole Steers, of Jobs Australia, told Guardian Australia the lack of data was \u201cdisappointing\u201d and would impact on the ability of job agencies to get people into work. \u201cThe government sets compliance to mutual obligations to assist people in doing what\u2019s expected of them.

      "body": "<p>The house in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ann-patchett\" title=\"\">Ann Patchett</a>\u2019s eighth novel is the last word in desirable real estate. \u201cSeen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on. The panes of glass that surrounded the glass front doors were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought-iron vines. The windows both took in the sun and reflected it back against the wide lawn.\u201d</p> <p>The sun-drenched Dutch House \u2013 so named not for its architecture but for the nationality of its original owners, the Van Hoebeeks \u2013 is in every sense a hot property. Built in boomtime 1920s Philadelphia, it boasts Delft mantels and marble floors, a ballroom and a dining room with a gilt ceiling \u201cmore in keeping with Versailles than Eastern Pennsylvania\u201d. Crammed with silk chairs, tapestry ottomans, Chinese lamps and oil paintings, it is, as one of the characters observes, \u201ca piece of art\u201d and, like a piece of art, it ignites extreme reactions in the people who come into contact with it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence Maeve has 'a stack of Henry James novels on her bedside table' \u2013 among them The Turn of the Screw</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>First in line are the Conroys. Cyril Conroy is a hard-up but ambitious property developer with a talent for life-changing surprises. He acquires the house in 1946 when the Van Hoebeeks go bankrupt, taking possession not only of the building but of its servants and sumptuous contents, and installing his wife, Elna, and children, Maeve and Danny, in their ready-made new existence overnight. Their rags-to-riches move from a rental \u201cthe size of a postage stamp\u201d to the Dutch House with its treasures spells the beginning of the end of the marriage. Elna\u2019s disintegration, in all its flamboyant pathos and ascetic self-denial, is brilliantly handled. Insisting that she has \u201cno business in a place like that, all those fireplaces and staircases, all those people waiting on me\u201d, she flees to help the destitute in India. Art is not for everyone.</p> <p>When Elna goes, the Conroys are thrown into a crisis of archetypal proportions: \u201cThey had all become characters in the worst part of a fairytale.\u201d The children are left to the ministrations of the cook and housekeeper, a pair of warm-hearted sisters (though Danny, like a fairytale prince, doesn\u2019t realise for a long time that his two watchful guardians have their own backstory). Their father, in the way of 1940s fathers and fairytale kings, is too busy ruling his empire to oversee their care. Danny survives the loss of his mother because his sister \u2013 loving, resourceful Maeve, vividly drawn by Patchett \u2013 steps into the breach: \u201cMaeve was there, with her red coat and her black hair, standing at the bottom of the stairs, the white marble floor with the little black squares.\u201d She\u2019s Snow White or Red Riding Hood as Vermeer might have painted her.</p> <p>Cyril introduces a young widow called Andrea and her two daughters to the Dutch House, and the fragile equilibrium of this kingdom is destroyed. Like all enchantresses, the demure but deadly Andrea has \u201ca knack for making the impossible seem natural\u201d, including marriage to Cyril. We know what happens next: once their stepmother has taken possession, Maeve and Danny will be systematically pushed out. But the question of what, if any, kind of reconciliation with the past might still be achieved after such a profound betrayal gives <em>The Dutch House</em> an irresistible narrative drive. It\u2019s a mark of Patchett\u2019s skill that the novel\u2019s bold fairytale elements \u2013 its doubles and archetypes, its two children left to find their own way back to their home after being expelled \u2013 add up to a story that feels wholly naturalistic.</p> <p>There are other, more subtle literary templates underpinning the book. It\u2019s no coincidence that Maeve has \u201ca stack of Henry James novels on her bedside table\u201d \u2013 among them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/03/fiction.colmtoibin\" title=\"\"><em>The Turn of the Screw</em></a>. An obsessive younger woman who comes to a big house and falls for the aloof owner? Check. Lost mother? Check. Terrorised children? Check. Stalwart and sceptical housekeeper? Check. \u201cLots of ghosts\u201d (as Danny puts it)? Check that, too. If <em>The Dutch House</em> is like a novel by James, however, then it\u2019s most like <em>The Spoils of Poynton</em>, cleverly appropriating that book\u2019s use of a coveted house and its treasures as an index to human character. Andrea is marked out as morally deficient during her very first visit to the Dutch House, when she singles out the portraits of the Van Hoebeeks to Cyril for praise: \u201c\u2018It must be a comfort, having them with you,\u2019 Andrea said to him, not of his children but of his paintings.\u2019\u201d Like a Jamesian villain, she prefers art to life.</p> <p>James said that the house of fiction has \u201cnot one window, but a million\u201d, depending on who is looking at the scene, and Patchett\u2019s elegantly constructed narrative often reads like a dramatisation of this idea. For years after they are banished from the Dutch House, Maeve and Danny make a ritual of parking outside their former home to watch the comings and goings of Andrea and their stepsisters through its vast windows. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?\u201d asks Danny, now in college, where Maeve forces him to endure years of expensive medical training simply to drain the educational fund that would otherwise devolve to Andrea\u2019s daughters. \u201cWe look back through the lens of what we know now,\u201d he decides, \u201cso we\u2019re not seeing it as the people we were, we\u2019re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.\u201d The glass-walled Dutch House may be open to view, but the truth it contains is obscured.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/29/q-and-a-ann-patchett-novelist\">Ann Patchett: \u2018My best kiss? I kissed John Updike as he presented me with an award\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the layers of the past are rolled away, the shocks keep coming. Vanished fairytale mothers have a habit of reappearing at critical times, and so it is with self-denying Elna, \u201cthe little sister of the poor, the assemblage of bones and tennis shoes\u201d. In spite of her frailty, she is a truly monstrous creation, dispensing charity with the ruthless impartiality of a saint, offering her love and presence to all except her own family. The other characters don\u2019t get off lightly either. Cyril is revealed as weak and neglectful, a man who never really liked children, even his own. And if Maeve is a substitute mother then she\u2019s in some ways as compromised a figure as Elna and Andrea, demanding her own relentless form of sacrifice in the guise of Danny\u2019s medical studies. Having carried out his sister\u2019s revenge against their stepmother by qualifying as a doctor, he refuses to practise medicine. Like art, healing is not for everyone.</p> <p>Except that, in the world of <em>The Dutch House</em>, it almost is. It\u2019s a rare Patchett novel that ends without the slightest glimmer of redemption, and here the major players virtually all \u2013 as in a story by James \u2013 arrive at final positions that involve an ironic inversion of where they started. Danny\u2019s eventual accommodation of the past, and of his family\u2019s choices, seems both inevitable and earned. \u201cThe point wasn\u2019t whether or not I liked it,\u201d he admits. \u201cThe point was it had to be done.\u201d And besides, by middle age he \u201chad the idea that all of the hard things had already happened\u201d: as always, Patchett leads us to a truth that feels like life rather than literature.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Elizabeth Lowry\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/15/dark-water-by-elizabeth-lowry-review-\" title=\"\"><em>Dark Water</em></a><em> is published by Riverrun.

      "bodyText": "The house in Ann Patchett\u2019s eighth novel is the last word in desirable real estate. \u201cSeen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on. The panes of glass that surrounded the glass front doors were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought-iron vines. The windows both took in the sun and reflected it back against the wide lawn.\u201d The sun-drenched Dutch House \u2013 so named not for its architecture but for the nationality of its original owners, the Van Hoebeeks \u2013 is in every sense a hot property. Built in boomtime 1920s Philadelphia, it boasts Delft mantels and marble floors, a ballroom and a dining room with a gilt ceiling \u201cmore in keeping with Versailles than Eastern Pennsylvania\u201d. Crammed with silk chairs, tapestry ottomans, Chinese lamps and oil paintings, it is, as one of the characters observes, \u201ca piece of art\u201d and, like a piece of art, it ignites extreme reactions in the people who come into contact with it. First in line are the Conroys. Cyril Conroy is a hard-up but ambitious property developer with a talent for life-changing surprises. He acquires the house in 1946 when the Van Hoebeeks go bankrupt, taking possession not only of the building but of its servants and sumptuous contents, and installing his wife, Elna, and children, Maeve and Danny, in their ready-made new existence overnight. Their rags-to-riches move from a rental \u201cthe size of a postage stamp\u201d to the Dutch House with its treasures spells the beginning of the end of the marriage. Elna\u2019s disintegration, in all its flamboyant pathos and ascetic self-denial, is brilliantly handled. Insisting that she has \u201cno business in a place like that, all those fireplaces and staircases, all those people waiting on me\u201d, she flees to help the destitute in India. Art is not for everyone. When Elna goes, the Conroys are thrown into a crisis of archetypal proportions: \u201cThey had all become characters in the worst part of a fairytale.\u201d The children are left to the ministrations of the cook and housekeeper, a pair of warm-hearted sisters (though Danny, like a fairytale prince, doesn\u2019t realise for a long time that his two watchful guardians have their own backstory). Their father, in the way of 1940s fathers and fairytale kings, is too busy ruling his empire to oversee their care. Danny survives the loss of his mother because his sister \u2013 loving, resourceful Maeve, vividly drawn by Patchett \u2013 steps into the breach: \u201cMaeve was there, with her red coat and her black hair, standing at the bottom of the stairs, the white marble floor with the little black squares.\u201d She\u2019s Snow White or Red Riding Hood as Vermeer might have painted her. Cyril introduces a young widow called Andrea and her two daughters to the Dutch House, and the fragile equilibrium of this kingdom is destroyed. Like all enchantresses, the demure but deadly Andrea has \u201ca knack for making the impossible seem natural\u201d, including marriage to Cyril. We know what happens next: once their stepmother has taken possession, Maeve and Danny will be systematically pushed out. But the question of what, if any, kind of reconciliation with the past might still be achieved after such a profound betrayal gives The Dutch House an irresistible narrative drive. It\u2019s a mark of Patchett\u2019s skill that the novel\u2019s bold fairytale elements \u2013 its doubles and archetypes, its two children left to find their own way back to their home after being expelled \u2013 add up to a story that feels wholly naturalistic. There are other, more subtle literary templates underpinning the book. It\u2019s no coincidence that Maeve has \u201ca stack of Henry James novels on her bedside table\u201d \u2013 among them The Turn of the Screw. An obsessive younger woman who comes to a big house and falls for the aloof owner? Check. Lost mother? Check. Terrorised children? Check. Stalwart and sceptical housekeeper? Check. \u201cLots of ghosts\u201d (as Danny puts it)? Check that, too. If The Dutch House is like a novel by James, however, then it\u2019s most like The Spoils of Poynton, cleverly appropriating that book\u2019s use of a coveted house and its treasures as an index to human character. Andrea is marked out as morally deficient during her very first visit to the Dutch House, when she singles out the portraits of the Van Hoebeeks to Cyril for praise: \u201c\u2018It must be a comfort, having them with you,\u2019 Andrea said to him, not of his children but of his paintings.\u2019\u201d Like a Jamesian villain, she prefers art to life. James said that the house of fiction has \u201cnot one window, but a million\u201d, depending on who is looking at the scene, and Patchett\u2019s elegantly constructed narrative often reads like a dramatisation of this idea. For years after they are banished from the Dutch House, Maeve and Danny make a ritual of parking outside their former home to watch the comings and goings of Andrea and their stepsisters through its vast windows. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?\u201d asks Danny, now in college, where Maeve forces him to endure years of expensive medical training simply to drain the educational fund that would otherwise devolve to Andrea\u2019s daughters. \u201cWe look back through the lens of what we know now,\u201d he decides, \u201cso we\u2019re not seeing it as the people we were, we\u2019re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.\u201d The glass-walled Dutch House may be open to view, but the truth it contains is obscured. As the layers of the past are rolled away, the shocks keep coming. Vanished fairytale mothers have a habit of reappearing at critical times, and so it is with self-denying Elna, \u201cthe little sister of the poor, the assemblage of bones and tennis shoes\u201d. In spite of her frailty, she is a truly monstrous creation, dispensing charity with the ruthless impartiality of a saint, offering her love and presence to all except her own family. The other characters don\u2019t get off lightly either. Cyril is revealed as weak and neglectful, a man who never really liked children, even his own. And if Maeve is a substitute mother then she\u2019s in some ways as compromised a figure as Elna and Andrea, demanding her own relentless form of sacrifice in the guise of Danny\u2019s medical studies. Having carried out his sister\u2019s revenge against their stepmother by qualifying as a doctor, he refuses to practise medicine. Like art, healing is not for everyone. Except that, in the world of The Dutch House, it almost is. It\u2019s a rare Patchett novel that ends without the slightest glimmer of redemption, and here the major players virtually all \u2013 as in a story by James \u2013 arrive at final positions that involve an ironic inversion of where they started. Danny\u2019s eventual accommodation of the past, and of his family\u2019s choices, seems both inevitable and earned. \u201cThe point wasn\u2019t whether or not I liked it,\u201d he admits. \u201cThe point was it had to be done.\u201d And besides, by middle age he \u201chad the idea that all of the hard things had already happened\u201d: as always, Patchett leads us to a truth that feels like life rather than literature. \u2022 Elizabeth Lowry\u2019s Dark Water is published by Riverrun.

SA is the last state in Australia to permit the use of spit hoods in youth detention centres after their use in the Northern Territory\u2019s Don Dale youth detention centre was exposed and sparked a royal commission in 2016. The Northern Territory is still fighting a civil case on the use of spit hoods. The Marshall government has given an in-principle commitment to phase out the use of the hoods by 5 September next year. Ombudsman Wayne Lines recommended the use of spit hoods be phased out within a year and the devices be removed from the list of approved mechanical restraints in youth detention facilities. In a report released this week, he said their use was \u201cinherently traumatic\u201d and not consistent with the \u201cobjects and guiding principles of the youth justice system\u201d. Spit hoods have been used at the Adelaide Youth Training Centre (AYTC) since 2014 and their use has been recorded since 2016. Between October 2016 and June 2019 they were used on 57 occasions against 22 kids. One-third of all reported uses of spit hoods were against the one child, who was placed in a spit hood 19 times in nine months. Lines said the hoods were also in breach of international rules around the treatment of prisoners and increased the risk of potentially fatal asphyxiation because children were often pinned in a prone position by several adults to get the hood on their head. The use of spit hoods has been linked to deaths in custody in the UK and United States. Lines reviewed the CCTV of 12 incidents where spit hoods were applied, during which children aged between 12 and 17 were restrained by a number of adult staff members. In one case, a 13-year-old girl was pinned to the floor by five staff members who put a spit hood on her head and handcuffed her hands behind her back, after she refused to go to bed. In another, 12 staff members went into a cell of a 17-year-old boy, which was not covered by CCTV, and emerged four minutes later with the boy handcuffed and wearing a spit hood. Both the boy and one staff member were later taken to hospital for assessment. In every case but one, the child was forced to the floor at some point during the interaction. \u201cChildren thrash about at the sight of the implement; some appear to be taken by surprise as it passes over their eyes; many appear to be crying when it is finally removed,\u201d Lines said. \u201cHaving reviewed the footage supplied to my investigation, I have no doubt that the application of a spit hood is an inherently traumatic event for the child or young person involved.\u201d Other states require that staff wear safety goggles and disposable surgical masks when handling detainees to mitigate the risk of contracting a blood-borne disease. The SA Department of Human Services, which manages the facility, accepted in-principle recommendations to phase out spit hoods but said that removing them as an option was \u201cproblematic at this time\u201d in \u201ca very specific and limited set of circumstances where other methods such as personal protective equipment are not viable or available\u201d. It did not accept a recommendation that legislation governing the management of youth justice facilities should be amended to end the use of force to \u201cmaintain order,\u201d restricting it to circumstances necessary to prevent a person from harming themselves or others. Two-thirds of the detainees at AYTC are Indigenous. Cheryl Axleby, co-chair of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service, said she was \u201chorrified\u201d by the report. \u201cThese primary school-aged kids were treated worse than animals,\u201d Axleby said. \u201cThey were pinned down and subject to risk of asphyxiation, which would cause immense trauma.\u201d This article was amended on 26 September 2019 to clarify the Ombudsman\u2019s recommendation on use of force.",

Her interests were zoology, psychology and chemistry, but the maths teacher convinced her that she would be unable to do lab and field work - \u201cI had a calliper and on uneven ground I would fall down\u201d - so she went to Oxford to read maths.</p> <p>\u201cI attended the first statistics lecture and thought \u2018this is rubbish\u2019.

Though these particular difficulties resolve by age eight, Golding says other associations may come to light and advises, \u201cpregnant women should reduce their intake of drugs, including over-the-counter drugs, whenever possible\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/31/summer-camps-for-all-no-mobiles-selfies-children\">Summer camps for all: no mobiles, no selfies \u2013 just the chance to be children | Hazel Davis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her research results often bring surprises, she says. In her current work on \u201cfascinating\u201d transgenerational effects, she recently found that if the grandmother smoked in pregnancy (yes, the grandmother), the grandchild was likely to have a higher than expected birthweight but a slightly raised risk of autism and obesity.

One ongoing piece of research is looking at the link between material on the internet and self-harm and suicide. It has so far found that <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhealth/1087/1087.pdf\" title=\"\">22% of young people have viewed self-harm</a> and suicide-related content online and 70% of those who have self-harmed with suicidal intent have accessed such material. Already presented to an all-party parliamentary committee, the work is feeding into development of mental health policy, as well as a joint approach with the Samaritans to try to get YouTube to change what it allows on its site.</p> <p>Alspac\u2019s role, Timpson believes, is to \u201cmake observations, explain them to government, push for specific policies and see practical change\u201d. It\u2019s a powerful model that has already proved its worth.</p> <p>Charlotte is gathering her daughters ready to go home. She has always been proud to be one of the Children of the 90s, she says, and she hopes Amelia and Isabella will be too.

Being here is much more fun than school, announces Amelia, as she shows off the animal plaster that covers her (apparently painless) blood test to a smiling Professor Jean Golding. The emeritus professor of paediatrics and perinatal epidemiology at the University of Bristol is founder of the hugely influential Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (Alspac), better known as Children of the 90s (CO90s).

As a child, Golding spent months at a time in hospital and contracted polio at the age of 13, which left her permanently disabled. Being ill so much meant she \u201cspent a lot of time watching,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I really am an observer.\u201d Clearly clever at school, she only realised many years later that her teachers were fighting over which of them would get the kudos of sending her to read their subject at a top university. Her interests were zoology, psychology and chemistry, but the maths teacher convinced her that she would be unable to do lab and field work - \u201cI had a calliper and on uneven ground I would fall down\u201d - so she went to Oxford to read maths. \u201cI attended the first statistics lecture and thought \u2018this is rubbish\u2019. They kept saying \u2018approximate\u2019. I don\u2019t like approximate. I like to know exactly.\u201d She switched to another branch of maths. She uses stats now of course? \u201cYes,\u201d she agrees, \u201cbut with care!\u201d She stood down as scientific director of Alspac aged 65, but her research is going strong. This month she published a paper showing that the children of mothers who take paracetamol in pregnancy (around half of mothers-to-be in Europe and America) are more likely to have behavioural difficulties, including hyperactivity in their early years. Though these particular difficulties resolve by age eight, Golding says other associations may come to light and advises, \u201cpregnant women should reduce their intake of drugs, including over-the-counter drugs, whenever possible\u201d. Her research results often bring surprises, she says. In her current work on \u201cfascinating\u201d transgenerational effects, she recently found that if the grandmother smoked in pregnancy (yes, the grandmother), the grandchild was likely to have a higher than expected birthweight but a slightly raised risk of autism and obesity. Traumatic events cascade down the generations, sometimes in unexpected ways. \u201cShock in one generation can be linked to a higher rates of obesity later on,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd one study involving grandparents who had been in one of the great famines of the second world war found that their sons have better mental health than others.\u201d Golding is now studying families with refugees, war deaths and similar challenges in their background and is \u201copen to any results\u201d. Her other main focus is locus of control. This identifies people as either \u201cinternals\u201d, who feel they have some control over their fate, and \u201cexternals\u201d, who think life happens to them and there isn\u2019t much point in trying to change it. \u201cThe main psychologist in the field pushed for us to include questions on this from the start,\u201d says Golding, \u201cand it turns out to have a big effect on the way people live and parent. \u201cChildren of externals are much more likely to be hyperactive, not sleep well, and have tantrums, and at age eight there is a huge difference in IQ [lower]. The really exciting thing is that you can change locus of control. We are now trying to gather enough evidence to convince people that this could have real benefits for the population.\u201d Clearly, Golding isn\u2019t retiring any time soon. \u201cI think I have enough to keep me going until I\u2019m 100,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, younger colleagues are developing new techniques for direct collection of data \u2013 including via smart devices and miniature head cameras \u2013 and examining social media, both for its use in data gathering and the effect it has on us. \u201cWe have followed people from an era when there was no real access to the internet, to it being inescapable,\u201d says Alspac\u2019s principal investigator, professor Nic Timpson. One ongoing piece of research is looking at the link between material on the internet and self-harm and suicide. It has so far found that 22% of young people have viewed self-harm and suicide-related content online and 70% of those who have self-harmed with suicidal intent have accessed such material. Already presented to an all-party parliamentary committee, the work is feeding into development of mental health policy, as well as a joint approach with the Samaritans to try to get YouTube to change what it allows on its site. Alspac\u2019s role, Timpson believes, is to \u201cmake observations, explain them to government, push for specific policies and see practical change\u201d. It\u2019s a powerful model that has already proved its worth. Charlotte is gathering her daughters ready to go home. She has always been proud to be one of the Children of the 90s, she says, and she hopes Amelia and Isabella will be too. With luck, she adds, she\u2019ll see their children joining as the COCOCO90s, bringing still more insight and improvement to our health and wellbeing.",

Since then we\u2019ve heard words from ministers, but what we haven\u2019t seen is action, backed by money, to improve existing housing and make more available. \u2018Some of the large housing associations have acknowledged they must go back to their social purpose\u2019 Tom Murtha Former housing association chief executive and founding member of Social Housing Under Threat There\u2019s been a feeling that maybe housing associations have lost their way \u2013 that they\u2019ve grown too big, or too commercial. Some are now changing. Some of the large ones have said very clearly that they need to go back to their social purpose. Some associations have recognised that, yes, they\u2019ve been developing new homes that, if they can afford it, some people find wonderful to live in, but that they also need to invest in their existing stock. Some are a lot slower to recognise the need to change, and I think that tension and separation is going to grow. \u2018For many disabled people, feeling you can do normal things at home also enables you to work\u2019 Delores Taylor Habinteg tenant, Surrey Habinteg\u2019s recent report [pdf] on the impending accessible homes crisis really saddened me. Living in an inaccessible property impacted my health and my ability to look after my children, who were considered young carers. Now I\u2019m in an accessible home, I can care for myself, which is wonderful for my children \u2013 they get to have a childhood. For many disabled people, feeling you can do normal things at home also enables you to work and contribute to society. Just building more homes isn\u2019t enough: the lack of accessible homes must be addressed. \u2018Helping people into employment isn\u2019t just a cutesy, nice-to-have extra\u2019 Lynsey Sweeney Managing director, Communities That Work Social housing is not just bricks and mortar. As a membership body for providers who want to support their tenants into good quality work, we believe you\u2019ve got to look at the impact of poverty on your community and do something about it. People living in social housing face a greater challenge to get into work, and when they do, they\u2019re likely to earn less. But helping people into employment isn\u2019t just a cutesy, nice-to-have extra, or part of a board\u2019s mission statement; research we commissioned shows there\u2019s a bottom-line business case to support your tenants to support their own tenancies. \u2018People are calling out for an alternative to the ideology driving Brexit\u2019 Harris Beider Professor of communities and public policy, Birmingham City University I think social housing has lost its way: it\u2019s going towards a philosophy where the bottom line is everything. People are calling out for an alternative to the ideology driving Brexit and it\u2019s beholden on social housing providers to articulate what it is that they\u2019re about, and how they can reach out to people who are disadvantaged, or poor, or black, or refugees, and say \u201cwe are trying to be a driver for diverse communities, because it\u2019s part of our ethos and values\u201d. I don\u2019t see that in a uniform way within housing organisations. I want to see a more progressive voice. \u2018The shortage of single-person dwellings is a big problem\u2019 Anna Lecky Environmental activist working to build a tiny house community in Belfast Over the course of 11 months last year, 148 people who were homeless in Northern Ireland died while waiting for social housing. There\u2019s a massive need for housing, but the shortage of single-person dwellings is a big problem. Tiny houses \u2013 sustainably built homes measuring approximately 35 sq metres, rented at low cost, like those designed here by the Holding Project \u2013 could be a solution. Other residents might be trying to get on the property ladder or have children who\u2019ve left home. We want to prove there is a demand for change, for the chance to live small and live differently. \u2018The first time they gave me a colour it was like they gave me magic\u2019 Nazzi Raha Artist, north-west London I worked as a phlebotomist in the UK for many years, but became homeless in 2016. After a year in a hostel with no support, I moved to One Housing\u2019s Arlington hostel in Camden and joined the art programme. It just opened the door for me: the first time they gave me a colour it was like they gave me magic. Art makes me calm, and it built up my confidence \u2013 I just forget every pain in my life. I live independently now but still use the studio and workshops at Arlington. It\u2019s so important these kinds of things are provided. \u2018For every \u00a31 invested in careful renewal, about \u00a312 of social value is generated\u2019 Anne Power Professor of social policy, London School of Economics We\u2019re losing a lot of social housing because of demolition and rebuilding. But there are a few cases where a housing association has taken control and replaced blocks one by one, allowing tenants to move across without breaking up communities. This requires careful, on-site housing management. Computer-based systems have their place, but they cannot run community services, or keep the grounds clean and safe. You need people on the ground and hands-on management. It means you can keep arrears in check, you can support people into work, you can help vulnerable people. Our research has shown that for every \u00a31 invested in that kind of renewal, about \u00a312 of social value is generated by reinforcing social links, maintaining neighbourhood conditions, and support community infrastructure. \u2018Some elderly LGBT tenants are going back in the closet because other residents don\u2019t accept them\u2019 Luchia Fitzgerald LGBT rights activist and resident, Irwell Valley Homes, Greater Manchester Housing associations need to be ready for an increase in the number of elderly LGBT tenants. Some are moving into accommodation and having to go back in the closet at the end of their lives because other residents don\u2019t accept them. That\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking. They also need to think about younger LGBT people \u2013 there\u2019s a serious problem with them becoming homeless and invisible. At Irwell Valley we\u2019re trying to create safe spaces for both groups, and we\u2019re training people up to spot the depression and isolation they can suffer. But a lot of housing associations really need to step up and recognise these issues.",

As it is, Zellweger\u2019s tour de force proves how \u2013 even as it comes at the expense of pure, eerie verisimilitude \u2013 having an actor literally find the voice of the person they\u2019re playing can contribute invaluably to the very arc of a performance. She matches Garland\u2019s tattered, liquor-soaked vocal stumbles early on, playing well beneath either woman\u2019s ability; by the time she reaches crisper, clearer notes, for a climactically redemptive onstage rendition of Over the Rainbow, the anxiety and labour that is audible in her voice feels so hard-earned, it hardly matters that she\u2019s not reaching Garland\u2019s highest peaks. The triumph belongs to the actor and character alike; with respect to the most lauded of lip-syncers, that\u2019s not a victory they know.

She and her partner Carsten Borck, an artist, knew they had to leave their residence in Italy soon and weren\u2019t looking forward to moving back to their native Berlin. \u201cI thought: \u2018Why not G\u00f6rlitz?\u2019\u201d said Bodenm\u00fcller, a freelance journalist . G\u00f6rlitz, Germany\u2019s easternmost city, is a well-preserved gem that has played the part of quaint Mitteleuropean burg in Hollywood films from The Grand Budapest Hotel to Inglourious Basterds to The Reader.

Other cities had already been experimenting with the idea of luring new residents by offering to cover their housing. Detroit was the first big city to try it, launching an innovative programme of paying promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year, and today the idea is being used everywhere from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela, Italy, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, which offers $10,000 to digital workers to move there for a year.

We\u2019re just the laboratory mice for this science experiment.\u201d The G\u00f6rlitz-based Interdisciplinary Centre for Ecological and Revitalising Urban Transformation (IZS), which is overseeing Testing the City, as the federally funded project is known, received more than 150 applications. Two-thirds were from larger cities, and several came from outside Germany, including from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the US and the UK. The 54 individuals and groups participating are singles, couples and families ranging from their 20s to 60s, including digital entrepreneurs, a film-maker, a model, visual artists and musicians. Each is assigned to one of three project-maintained apartments and offered free use of one of three spaces for work. Though the municipality hopes that some will permanently relocate to G\u00f6rlitz, the main intention is for ISZ to use participant interviews and questionnaires to inform a national urban development policy to help revive Germany\u2019s smaller cities. \u201cOur aim is to learn more about what people need, and if they move, what is their motivation,\u201d said IZS head Robert Knippschild.

The couple decided to leave Berlin because of its traffic, pollution and high rents, and settled in G\u00f6rlitz in April. \u201cG\u00f6rlitz feels like a lively town with a lot of young people, students, opportunities, empty spaces, and on the other hand peace and remoteness,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is a great combination for creative work.\u201d Borck and Bodenm\u00fcller like the cheap rents and high density of organic grocery stores and vegetarian restaurants but wish G\u00f6rlitz had better regional transport and more open-mindedness. They also wished they had more time there. \u201cIt\u2019s very intense, to try to meet people, learn the city and do our work in just four weeks,\u201d said Bodenm\u00fcller. \u201cIf we could stay here longer, we could leave and come back and have a better chance to understand the city.\u201d Knippschild\u2019s early conclusions from the pilot project suggest that cultural offerings and leisure activities are crucial to attracting nomadic workers, as are reliable travel connections and good housing. \u201cPeople are taking the project seriously, thinking about which phase of life they are in and what they need in terms of housing and living,\u201d he said of the participants. \u201cThis is giving us a great deal of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of G\u00f6rlitz.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

The figures, published in a Department for Transport survey, also reveal that the 10% most frequent flyers in England took more than half of all international flights in 2018. However, 48% of the population did not take a single flight abroad in the last year. The new findings bolster calls for a frequent flyer levy, a proposal under which each citizen would be allowed one tax-free flight per year but would pay progressively higher taxes on each additional flight taken. The revelations follow a new report from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government\u2019s official adviser, which urged ministers to put tougher regulations on the international aviation and shipping sectors to keep the economy on track for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Environmental activists said the new figures showed the UK could cut air traffic and emissions without affecting ordinary holidaymakers. \u201cThere is this narrative that tackling the climate change problem from aviation means stopping people from taking holidays or seeing their families \u2013 and actually, when you look at this data that is wrong,\u201d said Leo Murray, director of innovation at 10:10 Climate Action. \u201cWhat we need to do is target a minority of problem flyers and stop them from taking so many flights,\u201d he added.

Emissions from international aviation are not currently included in national carbon budgets such as the UK\u2019s but instead managed by a dedicated UN agency \u2013 the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, some have said the body is too secretive and close to industry to take on the major polluters. The CCC said international air travel should be included in the UK\u2019s climate strategy like any other business sector. \u201cNot having [international aviation] in the target is a barrier to putting in place good policies to get us on the trajectory to be net-zero overall,\u201d said Chris Stark, the CCC\u2019s chief executive. He argued that the UK should take a leading role in cutting emissions from the sector, rather than wait for more comprehensive international agreements to be struck. \u201cThere should be no barrier to bringing aviation emissions into the carbon budgets and then putting in place a set of policies that at some stage in the future will be compatible with those international agreements,\u201d Stark said.

But Johnson\u2019s refusal to answer any of the detailed questions about all this put to him by reporters en route to this week\u2019s United Nations summit looks very much like a stalling tactic, a bid to starve the story of oxygen. He will surely be hoping it gets lost in the enormity of everything else that is to follow Tuesday\u2019s supreme court ruling, which could yet plunge us into an early election or a constitutional crisis. But the two are not so easily separated. When parliament is sitting, able to ask questions or launch inquiries with legal force behind them, he will find it much harder to duck. Any threat to put parliament back into recess, or attempt to bury awkward questions about his past under all the sound and fury of a supposed \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d general election, will look as if he is avoiding scrutiny \u2013 not just over the realities of Brexit but over his personal integrity. Voters have long ago decided whether or not Johnson\u2019s character matters to them. But this is a public matter now, involving public money, which raises fundamental questions about fairness. The public deserves answers. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

She predicted that the Republican-dominated Senate would surely reject any articles of impeachment approved by the Democratic House, making the process appear to be merely partisan theater \u2013 a repeat of the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/clinton-impeachment/573940/\">1998 impeachment proceedings</a> mounted against President Clinton by House Republicans, which ultimately <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/16/will-impeachment-backfire-democrats-not-if-they-do-it-right/\">backfired</a> and led to Democratic gains in that year\u2019s elections.

She had previously <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/18/house-democrats-trump-impeachment-poll-1500741\">insisted</a> that impeachment would require public support as well as backing from at least some Republicans. It\u2019s too soon for polls to determine whether the latest revelations have shifted public opinion significantly, but so far only one Republican \u2013 Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan \u2013 has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/amash-impeachment/589783/\">called for Trump\u2019s impeachment</a>, and he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/451662-amash-leaves-republican-party\">quit the party</a> soon afterwards.</p> <p>Chances are, however, that Pelosi is calculating that while impeachment will pour petrol on America\u2019s already incendiary politics, Democrats stand to benefit from the conflagration. That\u2019s largely because, unlike the Mueller report, the Ukrainian scandal involves what appear to be clear and comprehensible issues of corruption and threats to US national security and the electoral process. Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/us/politics/trump-impeachment-whistle-blower.html\">already has admitted</a> that he attempted to pressure a foreign government to dig up dirt to use against his political opponent, Joe Biden, and he may also have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-ordered-hold-on-military-aid-days-before-calling-ukrainian-president-officials-say/2019/09/23/df93a6ca-de38-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html\">withheld military aid</a> appropriated by Congress as further leverage.

Historically, the college-educated voters who predominate in such districts voted Republican because they considered it the party of stability and responsibility. There are many reasons why college-educated voters (particularly women) have been tilting against the Republicans in recent elections. But the Ukrainian scandal, however it plays out, will strengthen the sense among these voters that Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/23/trump-falsely-tells-auditorium-full-teens-constitution-gives-him-right-do-whatever-i-want/\">considers himself to be above</a> the law and constitutional restraints, and further erode the Republican party\u2019s reputation as the law-and-order party.

Meanwhile, Greta Thunberg called him \u2013 and other world leaders \u2013 out for their malign neglect in failing to address the single most existential threat humanity faces, while revealing the energy with which a new generation of leaders is determined to act.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/world-leaders-generation-climate-breakdown-greta-thunberg\">If world leaders choose to fail us, my generation will never forgive them | Greta Thunberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Each year, leaders come to New York and remind us of the promise of the United Nations \u2013 the notion that the international community can work together to solve shared challenges. The meetings can also showcase the ability of US leadership to encourage countries to tackle serious threats. These gatherings can yield genuine results \u2013 commitments to tackle a pandemic like <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/25/remarks-president-obama-un-meeting-ebola\">Ebola</a>, for instance. Whether crafting solutions to pressing challenges or inspiring the world to act, UN general assembly can remind us how much America can achieve when it leads and works together with partners.</p> <p>Not this year. Of course, Trump\u2019s mere presence is more than enough to sap the power of American diplomacy on the world\u2019s greatest diplomatic stage, and this year Trump again came ready to embarrass himself \u2013 and America \u2013 by roaming the halls of the UN reminding the public that he attempted to force the president of Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden in a move that should be worthy of a unanimous impeachment conviction.</p> <p>And so, Trump refusing to participate in the UN climate summit was little surprise from a president who gutted domestic environmental protections, announced his intention to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, and is even trying to prevent California from enacting higher emissions standards for automobiles.</p> <p>Enter Thunberg. The climate activist from Sweden \u2013 who has helped spark a global movement of young people striking from school to press their leaders to urgently confront climate change \u2013 was the star of the show. Her remarks reminded us what leadership, courage and sacrifice look like.</p> <p>Speaking to the assembled world leaders, Thunberg outlined the stakes of inaction on the climate crisis and denounced the world\u2019s focus on \u201cmoney and fairytales of eternal economic growth\u201d. Thunberg made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/world-leaders-generation-climate-breakdown-greta-thunberg\">clear</a> what\u2019s coming: \u201cYou are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal \u2026 We will not let you get away with this \u2026 The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/world-leaders-generation-climate-breakdown-greta-thunberg\">Read</a> all of what Thunberg said. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/23/greta-thunberg-speech-un-2019-address\">Watch</a> the passion \u2013 and the justified anger \u2013 in how she said it. Too many of the world\u2019s leaders \u2013 political, corporate, civic \u2013 are collectively robbing the world\u2019s youth of their futures. The lack of action means that young people like her have to sacrifice, Thunberg said: \u201cThis is all wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d</p> <p>Thunberg\u2019s sacrifice couldn\u2019t find a stronger contrast than the selfishness of Trump, who only looks out for himself. His egotism was illustrated yet again when he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1176339522113679360?s=20\">mocked</a> Thunberg\u2019s speech.</p> <p>If politicians can\u2019t find a way to act quickly and on a scale the likes of which the world has never seen in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, the student strikes and marches will pale in comparison to what we are likely to see in the future. If entire generations know as a scientific fact that earth will, in their lifetimes, become violently inhospitable to vast swathes of humanity, what kinds of actions would we expect them to take?</p> <p>Thunberg is right \u2013 change is coming. There are leaders of countries and businesses making commitments to tackle the climate crisis. Local governments, like California, are trying to move ahead on their own when their countries abdicate their responsibility.

      "bodyText": "At the 2019 annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations, a 16-year-old climate activist took the mantle of global leadership usually reserved for the US president. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to not participate in the UN climate summit illustrated just how devastatingly Trump\u2019s climate-denying policies have undermined America\u2019s role in the world as a force for good, and how his actions could contribute to the destruction of the futures of countless billions. Meanwhile, Greta Thunberg called him \u2013 and other world leaders \u2013 out for their malign neglect in failing to address the single most existential threat humanity faces, while revealing the energy with which a new generation of leaders is determined to act. Each year, leaders come to New York and remind us of the promise of the United Nations \u2013 the notion that the international community can work together to solve shared challenges. The meetings can also showcase the ability of US leadership to encourage countries to tackle serious threats. These gatherings can yield genuine results \u2013 commitments to tackle a pandemic like Ebola, for instance. Whether crafting solutions to pressing challenges or inspiring the world to act, UN general assembly can remind us how much America can achieve when it leads and works together with partners. Not this year. Of course, Trump\u2019s mere presence is more than enough to sap the power of American diplomacy on the world\u2019s greatest diplomatic stage, and this year Trump again came ready to embarrass himself \u2013 and America \u2013 by roaming the halls of the UN reminding the public that he attempted to force the president of Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden in a move that should be worthy of a unanimous impeachment conviction. And so, Trump refusing to participate in the UN climate summit was little surprise from a president who gutted domestic environmental protections, announced his intention to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, and is even trying to prevent California from enacting higher emissions standards for automobiles. Enter Thunberg. The climate activist from Sweden \u2013 who has helped spark a global movement of young people striking from school to press their leaders to urgently confront climate change \u2013 was the star of the show. Her remarks reminded us what leadership, courage and sacrifice look like. Speaking to the assembled world leaders, Thunberg outlined the stakes of inaction on the climate crisis and denounced the world\u2019s focus on \u201cmoney and fairytales of eternal economic growth\u201d. Thunberg made clear what\u2019s coming: \u201cYou are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal \u2026 We will not let you get away with this \u2026 The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.\u201d Read all of what Thunberg said. Watch the passion \u2013 and the justified anger \u2013 in how she said it. Too many of the world\u2019s leaders \u2013 political, corporate, civic \u2013 are collectively robbing the world\u2019s youth of their futures. The lack of action means that young people like her have to sacrifice, Thunberg said: \u201cThis is all wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d Thunberg\u2019s sacrifice couldn\u2019t find a stronger contrast than the selfishness of Trump, who only looks out for himself. His egotism was illustrated yet again when he mocked Thunberg\u2019s speech. If politicians can\u2019t find a way to act quickly and on a scale the likes of which the world has never seen in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, the student strikes and marches will pale in comparison to what we are likely to see in the future. If entire generations know as a scientific fact that earth will, in their lifetimes, become violently inhospitable to vast swathes of humanity, what kinds of actions would we expect them to take? Thunberg is right \u2013 change is coming. There are leaders of countries and businesses making commitments to tackle the climate crisis. Local governments, like California, are trying to move ahead on their own when their countries abdicate their responsibility. And, as Thunberg exemplifies, younger generations are beginning to mobilize. One poll of US teenagers noted that roughly one in four people ages 13 to 17 have taken action \u2013 attended a protest, taken part in a walkout, written to an public official \u2013 to advocate for change in climate policy. But time is not on our side, and the longer that the actions of Trump and other leaders defending the use of fossil fuels are allowed to stand, the more catastrophic the results will be for our children. Tackling the climate crisis requires American leadership. America is by far the largest cumulative contributor of emissions since the industrial revolution and is currently the second largest emitter (after China). America has a responsibility to act; the worst effects of climate change cannot be averted without US action, and Americans are already feeling the pain of the climate crisis. Furthermore, American leadership, when wielded the right way, can produce results. The US has the unique ability to bring countries together on climate, as we saw when the US and China (the world\u2019s largest current emitter) struck a deal that created the political momentum that led to the Paris agreement. The speech that Thunberg gave should be echoed by an American president and accompanied by sweeping actions to cut emissions. Unfortunately, right now, such an America lies dormant. In his annual UN speech, Trump yet again trumpeted his nationalist \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies that do nothing but spurn the world. Trump has, for the time being, eviscerated the power of American leadership to do good. But Thunberg and her generation are ready to lead and to sacrifice. The world\u2019s youth won\u2019t accept failure \u2013 they have no choice.

      "bodyText": "Concerns about student welfare have been raised after a first-year student at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand is believed to have lain dead in his room for close to two months before the alarm was raised. The male student was found on Monday night at the Sonoda residence on campus in Christchurch after fellow students noticed a smell and alerted police, according to local media reports. He has not been named. According to the Christchurch Press newspaper, his father also contacted police after failing to locate him through his friends. The student\u2019s death is being examined by the coroner and no cause of death has yet been identified. Education minister Chris Hipkins said the death was deeply troubling. \u201cMy thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim. This must be an incredibly distressing time for them,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI have asked the Tertiary Education Commission to reach out to the university to offer any support. This tragedy raises a number of questions and I expect the university to conduct a thorough investigation.\u201d The dead boy\u2019s room was at the end of a long corridor and not attended to by the hall\u2019s cleaners, who worked only on common areas. Detective Senior Sergeant Craig Johnson said a scene examination was nearly complete and inquiries regarding the student\u2019s death were underway. \u201cSpecialist police teams have been called in to assist with formal identification, and this process is ongoing,\u201d Johnson said. The Press reported that a disaster victim identification team attended the scene examination because the body was in such poor condition. The team uses fingerprints, DNA and dental records to determine identity. A single room at Sonoda costs more than NZ$15,000 (\u00a37,600) a year. Professor Cheryl de la Rey, vice-chancellor at the university, said \u201ccomprehensive pastoral care programmes\u201d were in place at the Sonoda campus and that it would arrange an independent investigation to identify how the situation occurred and would offer counselling services to all students. She said in a statement: \u201cThis is an extremely distressing time for university students and staff. The University of Canterbury is doing everything it can to support the police investigation into the tragic death.\u201d",

The arboretum has 2,500 tree species from all over the world, including a national collection of maples. This autumn is predicted to be spectacular, thanks to a wet June and a sunny July, which provided trees with the right balance of sunlight and rain to produce the sugars that create the colours. Visitors can call the autumn hotline (0300 067 5691) to find the most vibrant areas to visit on the 600-acre site, and follow two seasonal trails through the Acer Glade in the Old Arboretum (one mile) and the Maple Loop in Silk Wood (two miles). There are free guided walks every day throughout September and October, and three autumn photography workshops (\u00a3125 on 15, 23, 25 October, imageseen.co.uk). \u2022 Adult \u00a310 adult, child \u00a34, until mid-November, forestryengland.uk Leaf drive, Forest of Dean/Wye Valley The UK\u2019s first \u201cleaf peeping drive\u201d has been mapped out through the Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley, offering domestic vistas to rival fall foliage tourism in New England and Japan. The 50-mile drive passes oak, ash, birch, beech, larch and sweet chestnut, and has 10 hotspots to stop at for the best views. Visitors can also explore the area on foot, by bike or by canoe, kayak or paddleboard; there are guided walks on 27-29 September (\u00a35, walkinginross.co.uk) and 26-28 October (walksinchepstow.co.uk). \u2022 wyedeantourism.co.uk Pig spotting, New Forest Ponies and cattle roam the New Forest in Hampshire all year round, but in autumn visitors can spot another creature: pigs. Up to 600 pigs and piglets are released each year to eat the fallen acorns, beechmast and chestnuts, an ancient practice called pannage \u2013 acorns are poisonous to horses and cows. Good places to spot them are around Bramshaw village, near Bolderwood deer sanctuary and on the northern edge of the national park. But don\u2019t get too close \u2013 they bite. \u2022 Until 10 November, thenewforest.co.uk Activity day, Kent Bedgebury pinetum in Kent has one of the most complete collections of conifers in the world: 610 of the 810 species that exist worldwide. Some that are particularly colourful in autumn are sweetgum, maidenhair tree, golden larch, cypress and redwood. Bedgebury also holds regular events, from children\u2019s treasure hunts to bat walks. This month, there is an activities taster day, when visitors will be able to try Nordic walking, Pilates, zipwiring or campfire cooking. There are walking, cycling, running and orienteering trails all year round. \u2022 From \u00a310 for parking, entry and activities free, 28 September, bedgeburypinetum.org.uk Running series, England A series of 10km runs is being held in 16 English forests this year. Still to come are runs around High Lodge in Thetford Forest, Suffolk (6 October); Salcey Forest, Northamptonshire (12 October); Sherwood Pines, Nottinghamshire (20 October); Thames Chase Forest, Essex (10 November); and Jeskyns Community Woodland, Kent (7 December). The routes are largely flat with even paths, making them suitable for novices as well as those looking to set a new off-road PB. \u2022 \u00a320 each, forestryengland.uk/run100 Forest festival, Borders There are more than 70 events taking place in forests, woodland, gardens and parks during the Scottish Tree festival. They include Treefest at Armadale Castle on the Isle of Skye; autumn walks and fungal forays at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh; and a tree treasure hunt and Samhain fire party at Cambo Gardens in Fife (from free, 28 September to 2 December, visitscotland.com). The annual Tweed Valley forest festival celebrates the woodland culture of the Scottish Borders. It incorporate the Peebles food festival and wood market; the Scottish conker championships; and Carvefest, a chainsaw-carving exhibition (free, 19 and 20 October, forest-festival.com). Photography exhibition, Dorset/Cumbria Fifty shortlisted entries in the annual Earth Photo competition are being exhibited in two English forests until the end of April 2020. Images fit into one of four categories: People, Place, Nature and, new this year, Changing Forests. The exhibit is at Moors Valley country park near Ringwood in Dorset from 30 September to 15 December, then moves to Grizedale Forest in Cumbria (19 December to 28 April). \u2022 Free, earthphoto.world Film screening, Northumberland The Custody Code, a film by artist Amanda Loomes, tells the story of sustainable timber production and the men and women who work in the industry, from the seed bank to the sawmill. The 25-minute film was commissioned as part of Forestry England\u2019s 100th birthday celebrations \u2013 the organisation was founded as the Forestry Commission in 1919, and now looks after more than 1,500 forests. Fittingly, the film is being shown in a wooden, solar-powered installation deep in Kielder Forest, Northumberland. \u2022 Free, until 1 December, forestryengland.uk Sculpture trails, Forest of Dean/North Yorkshire The Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail has a new permanent sculpture, Threshold by Natasha Rosling, next to a woodland pond. Visitors can walk through the artwork \u2013 two curved, interlocking red walls \u2013 which was inspired by the area\u2019s mining history. There are now 16 sculptures on the trail, which opened in 1986 with work by Cornelia Parker and David Nash (free, daily, forestofdean-sculpture.org.uk). Sculpture fans can also visit Rachel Whiteread\u2019s Nissen Hut in Dalby Forest, North Yorkshire, which was installed last year to mark the centenary of the first world war (free, daily, 1418now.org.uk). Forest bathing walks, near Cardiff Shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing, is said to reduce blood pressure, lower cortisol levels, improve concentration and memory, and boost the immune system. It\u2019s not difficult, either: it simply involves spending time in the woods, paying close attention to nature. And what better time to try it than in autumn? The National Trust website has a handy beginners\u2019 guide. For those who would prefer a real-life guide, there are plenty of organised forest bathing sessions on offer. For example, Mindful Walks offers forest-bathing walks and mindfulness practices in Fforest Fawr, eight miles north of central Cardiff. \u2022 \u00a310, next walk 17 November, mindfulwalks.uk Forest foraging, Northumberland Autumn is a great time to go foraging in the forest for mushrooms, nuts and berries. Unless you are an experienced forager, though, it is best to go with an expert to ensure anything harvested is safe and sustainable. One such company is Northern Wilds, which runs foraging days in Kielder Forest. The hunt ends with a feast prepared in the \u201cwild food wagon\u201d \u2013 a former military truck now powered by biodiesel and equipped with a wood-fired Rayburn. The day is based at Kielder campsite, handy for spending a night stargazing in the forest (Kielder is a dark sky park). \u2022 Adult \u00a365, child \u00a345, 5 October, northernwilds.co.uk Beaver walk, Highlands Knapdale Forest in Argyll &amp; Bute is known as Scotland\u2019s rainforest \u2013 the oak woodland is bisected by lochs and backs on to the sea. It is also home to a population of beavers, which were reintroduced in 2009. The Argyll Beaver Centre runs weekly guided beaver walks through the forest, viewing the work of \u201cnature\u2019s ecosystem engineers\u201d, and hopefully a glimpse of the rodents themselves. \u2022 Adult \u00a36, child \u00a33, Wednesdays until 30 October, argyllbeavercentre.co.uk Sound and light shows, Perthshire and Cheshire Every autumn, for the past 18 years, Faskally Wood in Highland Perthshire has been transformed into an Enchanted Forest by a sound and light show. The 2019 show is called Cosmos, and takes its inspiration from the skies above the tree canopy. Visitors follow an illuminated trail past Loch Dunmore, deep into the woods, with laser shows, video projections, pyrotechnics and a soundscape. A new feature this year is an inflatable geodome hosting an immersive experience that makes audiences feel as though they are flying through space (adult \u00a320, child \u00a310, 3 October-3 November, enchantedforest.org.uk). In Cheshire, the Magical Woodland is a similar show (adult \u00a317.95, child \u00a314.50, 12 October-3 November, magicalwoodland.com). Forest adventures, UK Garvagh Forest, 11 miles south of Coleraine, County Derry, opened new walking and biking trails this summer. The three walks include a 5km Agivey River route and a 6.9km circuit that skirts the perimeter of the forest, with great views. There is an easy circuit for family cycling and three mountain bike trails, from a short skills loop to a 4.7km technical trail (visitcausewaycoastandglens.com). For more high-octane adventures, Go Ape has some new night-time activities in forests this autumn. Sundown Segways take visitors speeding through the forest on Segways with only a head-torch to light the way, while Night Zips feature tree-top crossings and zipwire flights in the dark. Locations include Dalby Forest in North Yorkshire and Aberfoyle Forest near Stirling (selected dates in October and November, goape.co.uk). Woodland Trust events, nationwide The Woodland Trust is the UK\u2019s biggest woodland conservation charity, working to protect and restore existing woods, and plant new ones. It runs lots of guided walks and talks in its woodlands: upcoming events include a bat walk (soprano pipistrelle pictured) on the Smithills Estate in Bolton (free, 26 September) and a magical lantern walk in Plas Power Woods near Wrexham (\u00a32 children, adults free, 12 October).

The humiliated prime minister has been forced to cut short his visit to the United Nations in New York and return home after the Speaker, John Bercow, said the ruling by the 11 judges meant that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/bercow-mps-return-urgent-supreme-court-ruling-suspension-parliament\">parliament would be reconvened today.</a> Jeremy Corbyn was consulting with fellow opposition leaders last night about how to ensure the PM cannot escape the legal obligation passed earlier this month to delay Brexit if he hasn\u2019t reached a deal by 19 October.

      "bodyText": "Top story: PM and Trump face growing crises Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and it\u2019s my pleasure to bring you the top stories this morning. Boris Johnson and Donald Trump were all smiles yesterday as they gave a joint media conference in New York. But neither the British prime minister nor the president of the United States has much to laugh about today as they face mounting domestic political crises that threaten their positions. In this tale of transatlantic woe, Johnson will land back in Britain today to face furious MPs and a mounting constitutional crisis after his decision to prorogue parliament was declared unlawful by the supreme court. The humiliated prime minister has been forced to cut short his visit to the United Nations in New York and return home after the Speaker, John Bercow, said the ruling by the 11 judges meant that parliament would be reconvened today. Jeremy Corbyn was consulting with fellow opposition leaders last night about how to ensure the PM cannot escape the legal obligation passed earlier this month to delay Brexit if he hasn\u2019t reached a deal by 19 October. MPs want Johnson to face questions on this in the Commons today, although a Downing Street source said it was not clear if the PM would do so and it\u2019s not clear what happens next in parliament. Johnson, who maintains he will not seek a Brexit extension even he can\u2019t push a deal through parliament, tried to strike a defiant tone after the ruling, saying that he disagreed with the judges but that \u201cwe respect the court\u201d. Tory Brexiters rallied around their leader, as did some newspapers. Jeremy Corbyn tried to capitalise on the government\u2019s predicament by bringing forward his Labour conference speech by a day and issuing a rallying cry to the party to \u201cwin an election for the people of this country\u201d. Here are the five key takeaways from his rousing address in Brighton. * * * \u2018No one is above the law\u2019 \u2013 Back across the pond, Trump faces perhaps the most serious threat to his presidency yet after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she would begin a formal impeachment inquiry. Amid allegations that the president tried to engage Ukraine to smear Joe Biden, Pelosi said: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Democrats, who control the House, said they had no choice after the White House refused to comply with requests for information and testimony about the reports. The move comes in the wake of whistleblower allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate the business dealings of the son of Joe Biden, the former vice-president and the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential election. Trump dismissed the possibility of impeachment as a \u201cwitchhunt\u201d and his allies now plan to use the inquiry to their advantage. The increasing calls for impeachment will focus on electoral rules that prevent any party receiving a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign government. Tom McCarthy explains how the impeachment process might work and what happens next. * * * The computer will see you now \u2013 Artificial intelligence is on a par with human experts when it comes to making medical diagnoses based on images, according to a new study that will add to the growing excitement about the capability of computers in healthcare. AI interpretation of medical images relies on feeding information into algorithms and has shown promise in diagnosis of diseases from cancers to eye conditions. But the authors of the study from Birmingham university cautioned it was a reality check for the hype around AI. * * * Beauty myth \u2013 The advertising watchdog has banned two beauty salons from using ads on Instagram that imply their products can make customers look like Kylie Jenner. AKJ Aesthetics and Queen of Aesthetics used images of Jenner, the youngest of the Kardashian reality TV clan, to promote cosmetic filler products. But the Advertising Standards Authority says the ads \u201cmisleadingly suggested their packages would give customers lips, cheeks and jawline\u201d like Jenner, a cosmetics billionaire who has 150 million Instagram followers. * * * Mental health concerns \u2013 Psychiatrists have called for a public inquiry after inspectors found 28 privately run mental health units to be \u201cinadequate\u201d in the past three years. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has rated 16 independently run mental health units as inadequate so far this year. It put four others in the same category last year, and eight in 2017. * * * Fleaing the nest \u2013 Two days after her stunning triple triumph at the Emmys, Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge has announced that she has signed a deal to produce exclusive content for Amazon Prime. The actor and writer says she is \u201cinsanely excited\u201d to continue working for the entertainment arm of the global shopping site, which already screens Fleabag in 200 countries. But her decision bears out warnings by Channel Four boss Alex Mahon and former BBC boss Mark Thompson about the loss of homegrown British talent to overseas rivals. Today in Focus podcast: \u2018The effect on democracy was extreme\u2019 Philippe Sands QC on the decision by the supreme court to rule against the government on the suspension of parliament. Plus: Shoshana Zuboff on how to fight back against surveillance capitalism. Lunchtime read: Louis Tomlinson on personal tragedy and going solo Louis Tomlinson says he wasn\u2019t ready for the breakup of One Direction and a solo career outside the boyband bubble. The death of his mother Johannah from leukaemia a year later and his sister from an accidental overdose in March this year has left him facing a \u201cdark side\u201d, he tells our interviewer Emine Saner. But the personal tragedy he has suffered \u201cgives me strength everywhere else in my life\u201d, he says, and \u201cit makes everything else, not feel easier and not less important, but \u2026 you see things for what they are\u201d. His solo career is blossoming with a new single and, if not yet as successful as his former bandmates Harry Styles and Niall Horan, he is philosophical: \u201cI\u2019ve never been competitive like that, but, naturally, you think: \u2018If they\u2019re getting this then I deserve that.\u2019\u201d Sport Plans by the IOC to introduce stricter guidelines for transgender athletes before the Tokyo 2020 Games have run into the sand because its panel of scientists is struggling to reach agreement on the issue. Tottenham are out of the Carabao Cup after being beaten 4-3 on penalties by Colchester United, whose giantkilling exploits left a subdued Mauricio Pochettino wondering when his underperforming side will rediscover their sense of unity. There were no such upsets for Manchester City, Arsenal and Southampton. Eddie Jones has bristled at the suggestion he is taking a risk by naming Billy Vunipola to start for the second time in five days against the USA at the Rugby World Cup, and issuing a stark warning to the 10 new faces in his England side. At the Road World Championships, the women\u2019s time trial, won by Chloe Dygert, and the men\u2019s under\u201123 event, won by Mikkel Bjerg, were both hit by extreme weather that made conditions in Harrogate \u201clike riding into a lake\u201d. Manchester United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has offered Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r his long-term backing in response to the manager\u2019s mixed results at the start of the season. And Andy Murray claimed his first ATP Tour singles victory since January by beating Tennys Sandgren in the opening round of the Zhuhai Championships. Business Thomas Cook directors could face legal action in the wake of the collapse of the travel company which left more than 150,000 Britons stranded abroad. Investigations will focus on the conduct of the board and the last three chief executives, who were paid a total of \u00a335m in the years before the firm went bust with debts of \u00a31.7bn. The auditing firms responsible for signing off the company\u2019s accounts will also face scrutiny. There are also fears that Wrightbus, the Northern Ireland bus maker, could follow Thomas Cook into administration today.

Edwina MacDonald, the legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said Australian leadership to build international pressure on Saudi Arabia was welcomed. \u201cWe applaud the Australian government for taking a principled stand and speaking up about extremely concerning human rights violations that another member of the council has been committing with impunity,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cPublic condemnation like this from Australia and other countries will increase the pressure on Saudi Arabia \u2026 if you have a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, then you have an obligation to use it.\u201d The UN feud complicates Australia\u2019s relationship with the Saudi kingdom. Australia sells weapons to Saudi Arabia, and Australia is a part of the US-led mission patrolling the Strait of Hormuz, a mission aimed at curbing Saudi antagonist Iran\u2019s actions in the Gulf. A UN report earlier this month detailed compelling evidence of possible war crimes by the Saudi-led coalition fighting a war against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia has starved civilians, bombed hospitals and blocked humanitarian aid during the five-year conflict in the gulf state. The UN report warned that countries which arm the Saudi military, such as Australia, the US, UK and France, could also be guilty of war crimes.",

He\u2019d write music and I\u2019d go away and write words.\u201d The pair were surprised at how effectively this created what Radcliffe calls \u201celectronic pop songs, but very warm and dreamlike\u201d. Radcliffe hopes UNE aren\u2019t seen as \u201csome radio bloke having a dabble\u201d. He was, after all, in bands before becoming a DJ. \u201cI\u2019ve never really seen a divide between the two. Sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn\u2019t because radio people think, \u2018We can\u2019t play that \u2013 it\u2019s Mark.\u2019 I just hope we get the same chance as everyone else.\u201d Over the years, his DJing has coexisted with playing in the not-yet-legendary pirate folkies Galleon Blast, spoof combo the Shirehorses, and Dr Feelgood-inspired Mark Radcliffe and the Big Figures. Early on, he even played drums in Skrewdriver, before singer Ian Donaldson became known as a white supremacist. \u201cThere were never any obvious signs of that while I was in them,\u201d says the avowedly anti-racist DJ. \u201cHe did wear jackboots, though. God, I\u2019m making this worse, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Meanwhile, UNE\u2019s press release calls Langley a \u201cHa\u00e7ienda DJ-booth fixture\u201d. Langley laughs. \u201cMy brother was actually the DJ. But I carried his record box around the world.\u201d Radcliffe\u2019s radio career began in 1979 when, at the age of 21, Manchester\u2019s Piccadilly Radio asked him to present Transmissions, a show about the music exploding in the city, triggered by Joy Division and Factory Records. \u201cI thought, \u2018How hard can that be?\u2019 I tried to be Manchester\u2019s John Peel, telling people what we were playing in a manic depressive voice.\u201d In 1997, he found himself (alongside ex-Fall guitarist Marc \u201cLard\u201d Riley) briefly hosting Radio 1\u2019s flagship breakfast show. \u201cIt was the biggest show in Europe \u2013 until we took it over,\u201d he chuckles. Their anarchic, edgy, Mancunian humour didn\u2019t always travel. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten the focus-group woman in Guildford who said, \u2018I don\u2019t pay my licence fee to hear scummy northerners.\u2019\u201d But his radio persona \u2013 self-effacing, ordinary bloke lost in music \u2013 works because it\u2019s real. Langley roars at the tale Radcliffe tells of the time he and Lard were in David Bowie\u2019s dressing room with the star asking where \u201cHeroes\u201d should go on the setlist. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018Is this really happening?\u2019\u201d Radcliffe hoots. \u201cDon\u2019t ask us, Dave!\u201d In August last year, Radcliffe was diagnosed with cancer. As Langley ferried his mate around during treatment, the pair became even closer. Radcliffe is now cancer-free and doesn\u2019t want to spend his life worrying that it will come back. After well-received performances at Bluedot and Kendal Calling festivals, there will be more gigs, although the pair have yet to master the demands of being electronic gods. \u201cOne night,\u201d says Radcliffe, \u201cinstead of singing, \u2018The distant clatter of a thunderstorm\u2019, I sang, \u2018The distant clatter of a leprechaun.\u2019 You can see the trouble we\u2019ve got.\u201d Lost is out on 18 October. UNE play the Old Courts, Wigan, 3 October, and more dates before Christmas. Mark Radcliffe\u2019s book, Crossroads, is published by Canongate.",

      "bodyText": "Sustainably caught North Sea cod could disappear from UK supermarket shelves next year after it was announced that certification is being suspended following a dramatic decline in populations. Cod populations in the sea had been thought to be in good health but the latest scientific advice has revealed much lower amounts of fish, putting the fishery at increased risk of collapse. The decision by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) means North Sea cod is coming off the menu again for consumers who want their fish supper to be sustainable, just two years after the fishery secured the \u201cblue tick\u201d eco-label. MSC certification, which allows seafood and fish products to carry the label that shows it comes from sustainable fisheries, will be suspended from all MSC-certified fisheries targeting North Sea cod from 24 October. The news deals a blow to the fishing industry, which has introduced measures to avoid catching young fish, such as closing large spawning areas to fishing, trialling new nets, and avoiding areas where cod congregate to avoid catching them when fishing for other species. The North Sea cod fishery supplies a relatively small amount of the 115,000 tonnes of cod eaten every year in the UK.

      "body": "<p>After Louis Tomlinson\u2019s recent show in Madrid, some fans got the chance to meet him. One girl wanted to talk to him about his song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oX_gwwACls\" title=\"\">Two of Us</a> , which he had written after the death of his mother. The girl had lost her dad, and wanted the singer to know how much his lyrics had meant to her. He\u2019d never had that in his band One Direction, he says. \u201cWe wrote cool songs, but they were love songs. It only goes so far, and to have someone say that I could help them with my \u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt blows my mind, that shit. I was proper proud.\u201d</p> <p>It has been a hard few years. Tomlinson\u2019s mother died in 2016, just as he was about to launch his first solo single. In March this year, his 18-year-old sister was found unconscious at her flat in London and couldn\u2019t be revived. We will come to that, but, professionally, Tomlinson was struggling too. One Direction \u2013 that supernova of a boy band \u2013 broke up in 2015. Or announced they were taking a break. Or \u201c\u2018hiatus\u2019 or whatever word we use\u201d, he says with a smile.</p> <p>At the time, Tomlinson, now 27, was finding his place as a songwriter. \u201cI wasn\u2019t singing a lot, I wasn\u2019t the frontman. Without being a sorry little bastard, I thought: \u2018How do I do better, how do I make something of myself, an identity?\u2019\u201d In the last 18 months of One Direction, he says, \u201cI felt like I knew who I was in the band, and I felt a real worth for who I was.\u201d The break up, he says, \u201crocked me. I wasn\u2019t ready for it. I felt like I was getting to be a better songwriter, singer, a more confident performer, and all of a sudden, when I felt I was finally getting some momentum \u2026\u201d</p> <p>We meet at a bar in north London. Tomlinson greets me with a hug as if I am one of his fans (I am not, particularly, although I am by the end). He seems open but not vulnerable, and more self-aware and modest than you would expect from a man who was once part of the biggest boy band in the world. He is friendly and relaxed, dressed in a black tracksuit, with a beer in front of him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzuvvjrUBEw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IzuvvjrUBEw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for Kill My Mind</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Tomlinson\u2019s personal tragedies also meant his solo career has had a bit of a stop-start quality, but now it looks as if there is focus and momentum. He released his single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzuvvjrUBEw\" title=\"\">Kill My Mind</a> earlier this month; an album will follow next year. Kill My Mind is an indie-pop delight, not so huge a departure as to alienate his fanbase, but it sounds like the music he grew up listening to \u2013 Oasis and Arctic Monkeys \u2013 and his South Yorkshire accent brings more than a hint of Liam Gallagher-style northern vocals. He sounds confident on them, more so than on the previous singles he put out, a couple of fairly forgettable collaborations. \u201cI think, in hindsight, that was me trying to find my place in the industry and making music I thought I had to make to get on radio.</p> <p>\u201cI had this epiphany when I was thinking about the music I grew up with,\u201d he continues. \u201cI kind of had a bit of a word with myself and worked out what I want \u2013 to be happy and proud of what I\u2019m doing. I love those early singles, but I never really felt proud of them, because it didn\u2019t feel too true to me.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, growing up in Doncaster with his mum Johannah, who raised him alone until she married Tomlinson\u2019s stepfather, he loved performing. \u201cI liked to be the class clown, I liked to make people laugh, to show off, all that.\u201d When his younger twin sisters were cast on TV dramas, he would sometimes go along as their chaperone, earning \u00a330. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, we don\u2019t have anyone who\u2019s been on TV or anything like that, so it was super-exciting,\u201d he says. He ended up picking up work as an extra. \u201cThe pinnacle of my acting career was one line on an ITV drama. I don\u2019t even know if they used my scene,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p> <p>When he was 15, he joined a drama group in Barnsley, which his mum would take him to when she could afford it. \u201cI think I was confused, thinking I wanted to act when actually what I wanted to do was perform.\u201d</p> <p>At school he joined a band, where they sang Oasis and Green Day covers, and when The X Factor came up, he made it on to the show in 2010 on his third attempt.

That day in general was so poignant. As much as you try and prepare yourself, it\u2019s a whole other thing when it comes.\u201d Because they had worked so much with few days off, he assumed that a break would be exciting. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t like that. When you\u2019re used to working however many days, it\u2019s all that more evident when you\u2019re not doing something. Especially in the first six months.\u201d He spent time in Los Angeles with his son, who was born in 2016, after his relationship with a stylist, Briana Jungwirth. \u201cMy life became \u2013and I don\u2019t mean this to sound derogatory \u2013 very normal, from being a life of pure craziness.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time that Tomlinson was trying to work out what to do with himself, his mother, to whom he was intensely close, had been diagnosed with leukaemia; she died in December 2016. He performed his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-AD7YPkFTo\" title=\"\">first single on The X Factor</a> just a few days after her death, then seemed to half-heartedly continue with his solo career, releasing another single in 2017. It would be another two years \u2013 during which he became a judge on The X Factor \u2013 before he released Two of Us, a raw and beautiful (and under-rated) song.</p> <p>\u201cAfter I lost my mum, every song I wrote felt, not pathetic, but that it lacked true meaning to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt that, as a songwriter, I wasn\u2019t going to move on until I\u2019d written a song like that.\u201d He knew he needed to get it out of him, but there was a lot of pressure \u2013 he felt he should be an experienced songwriter before he attempted it. Two songwriters he worked with played him the chorus. \u201cIt was like the song I always wished I\u2019d written. I went in and put my personal touch to the verses. It was a real moment for me in my grief, and as part of the creative process, because it felt like it was hanging over me.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oX_gwwACls\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5oX_gwwACls?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for Two of Us</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Earlier this month, an inquest found that his sister F\u00e9licit\u00e9 had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/11/felicite-tomlinson-sister-of-one-direction-louis-died-of-accidental-overdose\" title=\"\">died of an accidental overdose</a>; she had been taking drugs, including anxiety medication, since the death of their mother. He has been through some terrible times, I say, which must put a perspective on a pop career. \u201cExactly,\u201d he says, a little quieter than before. \u201cThat whole dark side I\u2019ve gone through, it sounds stupid to say, but it gives me strength everywhere else in my life, because that\u2019s the darkest shit that I\u2019m going to have to deal with. So it makes everything else, not feel easier and not less important, but, in the grand scheme of things, you see things for what they are, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>His fans have been crucial, he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure every artist says this, but I do believe it. We\u2019ve been through some dark times together and those things I\u2019ve been through, they carry a weight, emotionally, on the fans as well. And I felt their love and support. I remember really clearly when I lost my mum, that support was mad.\u201d</p> <p>What have the experiences of loss he has been through taught him about himself? He thinks for a second. \u201cI keep going back to it, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a combination of where I grew up and my mum\u2019s influence, but I just have this luxury of being able to see the glass half-full no matter what.\u201d He is the oldest of his mother\u2019s seven children, which is grounding and means, he says, \u201cthere\u2019s no time for me to be sat feeling sorry for myself. I\u2019ve been to rock bottom and I feel like, whatever my career\u2019s going to throw in front of me, it\u2019s going to be nothing as big or as emotionally heavy as that.

      "bodyText": "After Louis Tomlinson\u2019s recent show in Madrid, some fans got the chance to meet him. One girl wanted to talk to him about his song Two of Us , which he had written after the death of his mother. The girl had lost her dad, and wanted the singer to know how much his lyrics had meant to her. He\u2019d never had that in his band One Direction, he says. \u201cWe wrote cool songs, but they were love songs. It only goes so far, and to have someone say that I could help them with my \u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt blows my mind, that shit. I was proper proud.\u201d It has been a hard few years. Tomlinson\u2019s mother died in 2016, just as he was about to launch his first solo single. In March this year, his 18-year-old sister was found unconscious at her flat in London and couldn\u2019t be revived. We will come to that, but, professionally, Tomlinson was struggling too. One Direction \u2013 that supernova of a boy band \u2013 broke up in 2015. Or announced they were taking a break. Or \u201c\u2018hiatus\u2019 or whatever word we use\u201d, he says with a smile. At the time, Tomlinson, now 27, was finding his place as a songwriter. \u201cI wasn\u2019t singing a lot, I wasn\u2019t the frontman. Without being a sorry little bastard, I thought: \u2018How do I do better, how do I make something of myself, an identity?\u2019\u201d In the last 18 months of One Direction, he says, \u201cI felt like I knew who I was in the band, and I felt a real worth for who I was.\u201d The break up, he says, \u201crocked me. I wasn\u2019t ready for it. I felt like I was getting to be a better songwriter, singer, a more confident performer, and all of a sudden, when I felt I was finally getting some momentum \u2026\u201d We meet at a bar in north London. Tomlinson greets me with a hug as if I am one of his fans (I am not, particularly, although I am by the end). He seems open but not vulnerable, and more self-aware and modest than you would expect from a man who was once part of the biggest boy band in the world. He is friendly and relaxed, dressed in a black tracksuit, with a beer in front of him. Tomlinson\u2019s personal tragedies also meant his solo career has had a bit of a stop-start quality, but now it looks as if there is focus and momentum. He released his single Kill My Mind earlier this month; an album will follow next year. Kill My Mind is an indie-pop delight, not so huge a departure as to alienate his fanbase, but it sounds like the music he grew up listening to \u2013 Oasis and Arctic Monkeys \u2013 and his South Yorkshire accent brings more than a hint of Liam Gallagher-style northern vocals. He sounds confident on them, more so than on the previous singles he put out, a couple of fairly forgettable collaborations. \u201cI think, in hindsight, that was me trying to find my place in the industry and making music I thought I had to make to get on radio. \u201cI had this epiphany when I was thinking about the music I grew up with,\u201d he continues. \u201cI kind of had a bit of a word with myself and worked out what I want \u2013 to be happy and proud of what I\u2019m doing. I love those early singles, but I never really felt proud of them, because it didn\u2019t feel too true to me.\u201d As a child, growing up in Doncaster with his mum Johannah, who raised him alone until she married Tomlinson\u2019s stepfather, he loved performing. \u201cI liked to be the class clown, I liked to make people laugh, to show off, all that.\u201d When his younger twin sisters were cast on TV dramas, he would sometimes go along as their chaperone, earning \u00a330. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, we don\u2019t have anyone who\u2019s been on TV or anything like that, so it was super-exciting,\u201d he says. He ended up picking up work as an extra. \u201cThe pinnacle of my acting career was one line on an ITV drama. I don\u2019t even know if they used my scene,\u201d he says with a laugh. When he was 15, he joined a drama group in Barnsley, which his mum would take him to when she could afford it. \u201cI think I was confused, thinking I wanted to act when actually what I wanted to do was perform.\u201d At school he joined a band, where they sang Oasis and Green Day covers, and when The X Factor came up, he made it on to the show in 2010 on his third attempt. He queued from 3am to make sure the producers wouldn\u2019t have audition fatigue before they saw him, and he got his goal \u2013 to get in front of Simon Cowell \u201cand just have a professional opinion on how I am as a singer. I was so flustered. Going from school performances to performing in front of professionals, TV cameras, a 3,000-strong audience. I wasn\u2019t present. I sang terribly. I remember coming away from it thinking: \u2018I wonder if I\u2019ve got through as one of those lads who looks all right but isn\u2019t really a good singer.\u2019\u201d Yet he ended up in One Direction, the band the show put together in its 2010 series. For six years they sold tens of millions of records, broke America and each made a rumoured \u00a340m-plus fortune. Their fans, Directioners, are another level of devoted. I don\u2019t know how he coped with the attention, or the pressure. There were really only a few times when it got too much, says Tomlinson.

I\u2019ve never been competitive like that, but, naturally, you think: \u2018If they\u2019re getting this then I deserve that.\u2019 I think, the longer time goes on, I can see it for what it is and just be proud of them.\u201d And success means something else to him now. \u201cIt means I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Kill My Mind, by Louis Tomlinson, is out now on Syco Music. His debut album will be released in 2020",

Ironically, while Mahdavian cut the film to \u201cunclean it up \u2013 to avoid editing norms, and to make you aware that they were mobile phones\u201d, the sound team worked to buffer up the audio enough to translate the experience of cell video to a bigger screen.</p> <p>The phone itself is a constant presence within the film, its screen \u2013 showing maps of Turkish countryside, WhatsApp, video of Nargis dancing to Michael Jackson\u2019s They Don\u2019t Care About Us played through another phone \u2013 shaping both the perception and direction of their journey. \u201cA lot of people have documented how central [the mobile phone] is to the migrant experience,\u201d said Mahdavian. \u201cWhether you are or are not a film-maker, it\u2019s a lifeline for so many people.\u201d A lifeline, and a semblance of control; every member of the Fazili family takes their turn capturing the experience \u2013 Fatima films Hassan, Hassan films Zahra, someone films Nargis filming her stuff bear, framed with barbed wire at a detention center on the Hungarian border. \u201cThis was a family-generated portrait, not just a father-generated portrait,\u201d Mahdavian said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4271a16f610ef313925bba0dc7c0bd15a24e94b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4271a16f610ef313925bba0dc7c0bd15a24e94b/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Midnight Traveler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As such, the ethics of filming \u2013 autobiography of your own family\u2019s painful and vulnerable moments \u2013 grow into one of Midnight Traveler\u2019s biggest, and most potent, themes.

The story is told in voiceover, over peaceful footage of the moon and birds. Hassan loves film-making, he says, \u201cbut sometimes cinema is so dirty\u201d. For one moment, he thinks not of his family\u2019s safety, but of the drama\u2019s potential on screen. \u201cWhat a scene you\u2019re in!\u201d he thinks. \u201cThis is the best scene in the film.\u201d And in that moment, he says, he hates himself so much.</p> <p>What happens when the processing of experience becomes inextricable from its recording, when living in the moment becomes simultaneous with understanding how you can use the moment in the story you will tell others?

In his imagination, Hassan says, the film ends when they reach their destination; in reality, the film ends in Hungary, with their case in limbo. In April 2018, the Fazilis arrived in Germany, where they remain today, both girls in school, according to Mahdavian and Kim.

      "bodyText": "Departmental officials have contradicted Christian Porter\u2019s claim the Coalition\u2019s union penalty bill does not allow deregistration for single instances of unprotected industrial action or breaches of court orders. Officials from the attorney general\u2019s department told an inquiry on Wednesday that although the Ensuring Integrity Bill was similar to the existing law in that respect, it would expand the type of breaches courts can punish with the strictest penalties. Also on Wednesday the controversial unionist John Setka doubled down on his war of words with the independent senator Jacqui Lambie \u2013 who has warned the bill will pass if he does not resign \u2013 accusing her of blackmail in a full-page ad in Melbourne\u2019s Herald Sun. \u201cWhile the sideshow surrounding me and my personal life \u2013 fuelled by politicians, union officials and anonymous faceless men \u2013 continues, the real issue is the Ensuring Integrity Bill which will affect millions of Australians\u2019 democratic rights,\u201d Setka said in the letter. He said the \u201clast thing that Australian working families need is Jacqui Lambie\u2019s personal attempts to blackmail myself, our members and 13 million other Australian workers\u201d. \u201cNo politician has the right to dictate who should lead a union. It is the democratic right of all union members to elect their leaders, just as it is the voting public\u2019s right to elect their politicians. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that neither I, nor any union, ever gives in to blackmail. At the end of the day our members want me to stay, so I stay.\u201d In two days of hearings at the Senate education and employment committee, union officials have urged senators to consider the bill\u2019s impact beyond Setka, who has been suspended from the Labor party pending possible expulsion and asked to resign by the head of the union movement, Sally McManus. On Wednesday the Labor senator Tony Sheldon \u2013 the former national secretary of the Transport Workers Union \u2013 challenged officials over Porter\u2019s claims that deregistration would require repeated, systematic breaches of law. Porter told the lower house on 31 July: \u201cThe idea that this bill, as it is drafted and presented to this parliament, would allow for deregistration for such minor or isolated instances of unprotected, unlawful industrial action is patently absurd. It\u2019s untrue.\u201d The officials agreed that under section 28G of the bill one instance of unprotected \u201cobstructive industrial action\u201d could result in deregistration if it interfered with an employer\u2019s activities, the provision of a public service or is likely to harm safety, health or welfare of part of the community. Similarly, section 28F would only require one breach of a court or tribunal order to trigger potential deregistration. The officials explained that those provisions were modelled on the existing law which already allowed for deregistration for single instances of failing to comply with orders in \u201cvery specific parts of the Fair Work Act or Registered Organisations Act\u201d. \u201cNow these would apply to any failure to comply with any order or injunction made under the core workplace laws,\u201d they said. \u201cThere\u2019s potentially more orders or failures to comply with injunctions that might be relevant.\u201d Sheldon told Guardian Australia the admission \u201craises questions about whether the government has misled the public and the parliament about the effect of this bill\u201d. He said the bill would help \u201crogue employers who want nothing less than to cripple the representatives of working people and tie them up in litigation\u201d. Earlier, departmental officials said the current law doesn\u2019t allow deregistration as a penalty for breaches involving coercion, misrepresentation, freedom of association, and right of entry. The evidence is significant as the majority of the legal breaches committed by the militant Construction Forestry Mining Maritime and Energy Union relate to right of entry and coercing employers to enter union pay deals or exclude subcontractors who refuse to sign them. The officials said the bill addressed the \u201cshortcoming\u201d of existing law by ensuring that unions which can afford to pay fines \u201cas a cost of business cannot sustain [law-breaking] as an operating model\u201d. They noted that courts would still be required to consider the gravity of offences and the impact of deregistration on members when considering if it was an \u201cunjust\u201d penalty. Earlier the Brickworks industrial relations manager, Wladyslaw Kluktewicz, said the legislation could prevent unions which \u201cpush the envelope\u201d by talking to non-unionised workers. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an issue with non-union employees attending meetings \u2026 but they shouldn\u2019t be intimidated,\u201d he then clarified. The Coalition is still at least one vote short of support for the bill with Lambie and Centre Alliance in the box seat. The Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick has been fiercely critical of Setka\u2019s handling of the bill negotiations but insists he will not vote for it in its present form, and is seeking extensive amendments from Porter.",

      "bodyText": "Mining billionaire Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest is launching a business-driven initiative to try to tackle the hundreds of millions of tonnes of plastic waste produced every year around the globe. Forrest, through his Minderoo Foundation, is committing US$300m to launch the scheme that proposes manufacturers of fossil-fuel based plastic pay a voluntary financial contribution for doing so. The rate would not be payable on recycled plastics, which he hopes could drive the transition to use of recycled plastics in production and stem the flow of waste into the world\u2019s oceans and terrestrial spaces. Forrest has a long-standing interest in oceans and is a candidate for a PhD in marine ecology. He believes if major resin producers sign up to his proposal, the initiative \u2013 called Sea the Future \u2013 could raise US$20bn annually for global recycling, collection and environmental measures. \u201cThere\u2019s 7.5 billion people who consume plastic,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cThey get that plastic distributed to them by tens of thousands of brands, from building products to fast-moving consumer goods like Coca-Cola [and] Nestl\u00e9. \u201cBut there\u2019s only really around 100 major resin producers for petrochemical/oil and gas companies who make plastic resin that need to come on side and that is manageable number.\u201d Forrest said he had travelled the globe talking to major manufacturers of plastics while he was developing the proposal. He said a voluntary contribution for fossil fuel-based plastics would start at US$200 per tonne and, for the most difficult to recycle plastics, could be up to US$5,000 per tonne. He believes transitioning to a circular economy that limits the production of single-use plastic and creates an end-use for plastic waste that is currently being discarded into the environment is an opportunity for big businesses. \u201cIf they elevate the price of bad plastic or fossil fuel plastic, then instantly what becomes commercial is all the plastic in the world which is currently known as waste,\u201d Forrest said. He said such a scheme could also have an impact in reducing the climate footprint of the global plastics industry by decoupling it from fossil fuels. Forrest\u2019s US$300m commitment consists of $40m in startup capital and $1m per week for 260 weeks for a global body that would independently audit the scheme and funds raised from it. He did not say whether any major companies had said they would sign up to pay a voluntary contribution. But he said major producers and users of plastics in the global supply chain such as the Coca-Cola Company, Walmart and Unilever had responded positively to the initiative. \u201cThe protection of our oceans is fundamental to the preservation and flourishing of life on Earth,\u201d Alan Jope, the chief executive of Unilever PLC said. \u201cAt Unilever we are committed to ending ocean plastic and we welcome cross-industry initiatives, like the Minderoo Foundation\u2019s, that is looking across the value chain to identify scalable solutions.\u201d Forrest\u2019s announcement comes as the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, prepares to address the United Nations on Wednesday. Plastic pollution and the need for greater global recycling efforts are expected to be a key focus of the speech. But Australia has come under scrutiny for its apparent rejection of the need to do more to address the global climate crisis and failure to lay out ambitious targets towards net zero emissions. Morrison was not present at the UN climate summit this week and on Wednesday said debate about climate change was subjecting children to \u201cneedless anxiety\u201d. Forrest said he would not be drawn into commenting on politics and government responses to environmental issues. \u201cI believe in [anthropogenic] climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we must do everything in our power to reduce its impact and ultimately reverse it.

Koloamatangi advised Wood that TNRL would submit a list of players to be registered for two Oceania Cup Tests. The list would include the name Israel Folau.</p> <p>According to TNRL secretary and legal counsel William Edwards, who had been invited to the meeting but was in court, \u201cAs George communicated to the board, Nigel appeared surprised with the announcement that Israel made himself available, but not concerned.\u201d</p> <p>Thus Koloamatangi, believing he did not receive \u201cany negative response\u201d to the revelation of Folau\u2019s impending selection, \u201ctook the view that the CEO for the RLIF and other members of the RLIF did not object to Israel\u2019s involvement\u201d.</p> <p>The TNRL then informed Folau that he was entitled to play for Tonga, \u201cfor the reason that there was no objection raised by the CEO for the RLIF, and that having considered the rules, Israel Folau was eligible to play for Tonga according to RLIF eligibility rules,\u201d according to a press release.</p> <p>Wood did ask Koloamatangi that the matter be put in writing. A letter was sent to the RLIF, according to the TNRL, \u201cprior to the press release of 23 September 2019\u201d.</p> <p>RLIF contends it has not received an official application.

      "bodyText": "The news that Israel Folau had been approved by the Rugby League International Federation to play for Tonga in Test matches against Great Britain and Australia in the end-of-year Oceania Cup was such a surprise to members of the RLIF board that their subsequent press release stated, effectively, \u201cthis is news to us\u201d. According to Tonga National Rugby League chairman George Koloamatangi, the matter of Folau turning out for Tonga was discussed with RLIF chief Nigel Wood at the Tanoa International Dateline Hotel in Nuku\u2019alofa on 20 September. Koloamatangi advised Wood that TNRL would submit a list of players to be registered for two Oceania Cup Tests. The list would include the name Israel Folau. According to TNRL secretary and legal counsel William Edwards, who had been invited to the meeting but was in court, \u201cAs George communicated to the board, Nigel appeared surprised with the announcement that Israel made himself available, but not concerned.\u201d Thus Koloamatangi, believing he did not receive \u201cany negative response\u201d to the revelation of Folau\u2019s impending selection, \u201ctook the view that the CEO for the RLIF and other members of the RLIF did not object to Israel\u2019s involvement\u201d. The TNRL then informed Folau that he was entitled to play for Tonga, \u201cfor the reason that there was no objection raised by the CEO for the RLIF, and that having considered the rules, Israel Folau was eligible to play for Tonga according to RLIF eligibility rules,\u201d according to a press release. Wood did ask Koloamatangi that the matter be put in writing. A letter was sent to the RLIF, according to the TNRL, \u201cprior to the press release of 23 September 2019\u201d. RLIF contends it has not received an official application. Asked if Folau is eligible to play for Tonga, an RLIF spokesman said: \u201cHe has not applied for eligibility therefore it\u2019s not appropriate to comment.\u201d A link to the RLIF\u2019s eligibility criteria was included in an email. Folau does not appear to contravene any of the eligibility criteria. Thus TNRL, which was sought legal advice in Australia, is of the belief that Tonga can pick any Tongans they desire. At the nub of the issue is whether RLIF has veto power over Tonga\u2019s selection of Folau in a tournament run by events management and sports promotion company Duco Events. Edwards says he his not aware of any veto power that the RLIF \u201cmay or may not have\u201d but \u201cwould be anxious to see what rule they rely upon to refuse him a right to play\u201d. Asked if RLIF had any veto power to stop a player representing their country, RLIF\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cAll players are required to abide by the operational rules and participation agreements. If they do not then there are a range of sanctions available subject to investigation.\u201d The TNRL asserts that it \u201cknows of no rule that requires Israel Folau or any other player registered with the TNRL to apply to the RLIF to be eligible to play for Tonga. That is not the procedure for any player to participate in the end of year games.\u201d Asked had Wood given tacit approval for \u2013 or at least had not ruled out \u2013 Folau playing for Tonga, the spokesman said: \u201cNo approval was given or implied.\u201d Wood was contacted by Guardian Australia for comment. For his part, Folau said: \u201cWhat I will do now is focus on playing great rugby league and do my talking on the field.\u201d Presumably Folau was seeking to reassure league officials that he wouldn\u2019t publicly repeat the homophobic social media comments that saw him sacked by Rugby Australia and subsequently launch legal action against the governing body. RLIF deputy chair Peter Beattie told Channel 9 that the RLIF board had not made a decision in relation to any registration request for Folau. \u201cAs a current member of the RLIF board, as the ARLC rep, I can assure you that this has never been discussed or mentioned around the board table,\u201d he said. The RLIF board will meet on Thursday. Tonga is emerging as a \u201cfourth force\u201d in international rugby league. Yet NRL stars including Andrew Fifita and Jason Taumalolo have declared that players would boycott the Test matches unless Koloamatangi and Edwards stand down over the sacking of coach Kristien Woolf. Fifita wrote on Twitter: \u201cAs players, we will not take part in the world 9s and the 2 test matches at the end of year.

A study published on Wednesday analysed the backgrounds of 560 lobbyists listed on the federal lobbyist register, including 197 who declared they had previously worked within government. Researchers were able to identify the background of 122 former government representatives, finding 18% were previously MPs or senators, and 47% were senior advisors or chiefs of staff. Almost 20% were previously media or communications advisers. About 45% had spent more than a decade in government. The study, published in Public Health and Research Practice, used a series of 15 interviews to further examine the movement between government and lobbying for the gambling, alcohol and food industries. It considered examples of NSW politicians moving to the Australian Hotels Association and federal politicians going on to work for Crown.

But the vast majority of it is either not recycled, unrecyclable, or doesn't get reused once it's been recycled. Volumes ending up in the natural environment are surging.

It kills sea creatures that eat it but cannot digest it. It gets into the human food chain by contaminating the fish that we eat. It is even in our tap water. There is no science about the long-term impact of humans ingesting plastic.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is to be done?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taxing plastic bags \u2013 or even banning them outright as Kenya has done \u2013 has changed consumer and producer behaviour. But what next? Deposit return schemes for plastic bottles work well in several countries. Charging for one-time coffee cups also seems to be on the agenda. But the real solutions may not be top down but ...<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>... bottom up?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yes. Grassroots movements led the way on plastic bags, and have spawned others such as Refill, which emphasises reusing bottles, and A Plastic Planet, which urges plastic-free aisles in supermarkets.

The royal commission is investigating historic abuse of children and adults by state-run institutions between 1950 and 1999. It is the largest and most complex royal commission ever undertaken in New Zealand, and has been plagued by issues since its inception, including the resignation of its chair, Sir Anand Satyanand, last month. Now, survivors say they feel re-traumatised after it was revealed they unwittingly ate, drank and shared a motel with a man convicted of historical sex crimes against a child. The man was the partner of one of the survivor advisory group members, and drove her to meetings, and socialised with survivors outside official meetings. A spokesperson for the royal commission said commissioners were made aware of the man\u2019s criminal background on 22 August, but survivors who had unknowingly spent time with the offender were not informed until 24 September when media reports emerged. \u201cThat is probably one of the worst possible scenarios for people who\u2019ve been through abuse. I\u2019m horrified,\u201d said Jane Stevens, a survivor of abuse and an advisory group member.

Commissioner Paul Gibson has said the nature of the inquiry meant many of the people it was dealing with had criminal convictions. A royal commission spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cWe acknowledge the distress that some survivors may feel about this but want to assure them that this won\u2019t happen again. \u201cWe have a new manager of the survivor advisory group who has begun the process of vetting the members.\u201d Tracey Martin, the internal affairs and children\u2019s minister, has called an urgent meeting with the inquiry commissioners, and has refused to rule out sackings.

It was also the moment many allies of Donald Trump had been waiting for. As Democrats spent months on internal debates over whether to impeach the president, Republicans and conservative media were ready to march in lockstep and mobilise a strategy to weaponise impeachment for their own electoral advantage. Following Pelosi\u2019s announcement, they launched an offensive on multiple fronts to discredit her, throw fresh dirt at Joe Biden and paint the Ukraine affair as a Russia hoax redux designed to overturn the 2016 election \u2013 and raise cash via a swiftly launched \u201cOfficial Impeachment Defense Task Force\u201d. Far from the consensus that eventually led to the downfall of Richard Nixon, the whiff of impeachment merely inflamed a sense of divisiveness, alternative realities and an ugly political brawl that could make last year\u2019s clash over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court look positively tame.

I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Trust me, you\u2019ll see the transcript.\u201d It announced the launch of the \u201cOfficial Impeachment Defense Task Force\u201d and sought donations. Some Democrats have long feared that impeachment could backfire by rallying Trump\u2019s base and deepening a sentiment of \u201cus versus them\u201d. Trump\u2019s backers certainly hope so. Brad Parscale, his 2020 campaign manager, said: \u201cDemocrats can\u2019t beat President Trump on his policies or his stellar record of accomplishment, so they\u2019re trying to turn a Joe Biden scandal into a Trump problem.\u201d On Tuesday night, Tucker Carlson, a host on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News network, played dazed and confused, saying he had been trying all day to understand what Democrats were alleging. \u201cEven allowing for the hysteria of the moment,\u201d he said, \u201cthis seems pretty reckless.\u201d An hour later, his fellow host Sean Hannity, who is friendly with Trump, was predictably incensed. \u201cThe psychotic anti-Trump hysteria, it has now completely overtaken the entire Democratic party,\u201d he told viewers. \u201cWhat is happening is dangerous to this country. It is grossly political, will forever alter how any president in the future in his constitutional role as commander-in-chief will be able to communicate freely with other world leaders.\u201d An entire rightwing ecosystem had kicked in, demonstrating how difficult it will be for the impeachment case to penetrate the Trump universe. Kurt Bardella, the president of the strategic communications firm Endeavor Strategies and a former congressional aide, said the entire Trump presidency had proved \u201cnothing will deter the majority of Republicans and their propaganda platforms from standing by their man. \u201cTrump\u2019s support of a serial sexual predator like Roy Moore didn\u2019t do it. Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine our democracy didn\u2019t do it. Trump\u2019s relentless campaign to profit from his presidency didn\u2019t do it. Trump\u2019s blatant displays of racism didn\u2019t do it. Certainly the president\u2019s plot to hold foreign aid hostage in order to extort an investigation into a political rival won\u2019t change the equation for the GOP.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The long-awaited laws to reduce the practice of jailing people for unpaid fines will be introduced in Western Australia, more than five years after the death in custody that sparked the reform. The legislation to be tabled in WA parliament on Thursday will cancel all unserved warrants for unpaid fines but will still allow for people to be jailed in \u201cstrict circumstances\u201d if a warrant is issued directly by a magistrate. The attorney general, John Quigley, said the 2014 death of Yamatji woman Ms Dhu was the \u201ccatalyst\u201d for the reform. The 22-year-old was detained in Port Hedland to \u201ccut out\u201d $3,622 of unpaid fines when she died of septicemia on 4 August 2014, following \u201cunprofessional and inhumane\u201d treatment by police. The state coroner in 2016 recommended the practice be abolished and the McGowan government took the policy to the 2017 election. Another reform sparked by Dhu\u2019s death, the introduction of a mandatory custody notification scheme, is scheduled to become operational late October. The delay has been criticised by legal and justice advocates who have raised more than $440,000 to free Aboriginal women affected by the law. The campaign, run by Sisters Inside, has paid $419,510 in fines for 137 woman and released 20 women from prison. The most recent case was Noongar woman Keennan Dickie, who was put in jail for unpaid fines on Sunday night when she went to police with a broken rib to report a robbery. Once the new legislation is given royal assent, all existing warrants will be cleared. Told of that element of the bill, Sisters Inside founder Debbie Kilroy said \u201challelujah.\u201d The fines, penalties and infringement notices enforcement amendment bill 2019 will replace existing laws that allow the fines enforcement registry to issue a warrant of commitment for unpaid fines. Police can thenarrest the person and hold them until their largest fine is \u201ccut out\u201d through time served, at a rate of $250 a day. The new legislation will allow the sheriff to issue orders to a person\u2019s employer or bank to garnish unpaid fines from their salary or bank account, through the introduction of garnishee orders. The legislation would also allow for the garnishing of Centrelink payments, if given Commonwealth approval. Forced withdrawal would only occur if a person had above a \u201cprotected amount\u201d in their account, to avoid undue hardship. Hardship provisions will also be introduced to require authorities to take into account a person\u2019s mental illness, disability, experience of family violence, homelessness, drug and alcohol addiction and financial situation. Cancelling the driver\u2019s licence of a person with an unpaid debtwill also be prohibited if a person\u2019s last known address is in a remote area. Where a person cannot pay a fine they may be issued with a work and development permit, to pay the debt that way. \u201cThis bill draws a careful distinction between those who can pay their fines but refuse to do so, and the many experiencing hardship who cannot pay and should not face enforcement measures that further entrench them in poverty,\u201d Quigley said.

For more analysis, read Lauren Gambino\u2019s piece summarizing the significance of House speaker and San Francisco representative Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment declaration: Of course, Congress has already been probing various aspects of Trump\u2019s campaign, his businesses and his conduct as president. Pelosi\u2019s formal announcement, won\u2019t really change the progress of the investigations \u2014 but it does add a sense of urgency and gravity to House democrats as they weigh evidence. For more on how the impeachment works, read Tom McCarthy\u2019s explainer: Pelosi and other Democrats members of Congress who resisted an impeachment inquiry were convinced by new allegations that Trump pressured Ukranian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his 2020 rival and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. There is no evidence that either Biden did anything wrong. Officials within the Trump administration tried to prevent Trump from meeting with or calling Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy out of concern that Trump would use such occasions as opportunities to press Zelenskiy to get intel on Joe Biden, according to the Washington Post: \u201cAn awful lot of people were trying to keep a meeting from happening for the reason that it would not be focused on Ukraine-U.S. relations,\u201d one former official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. White House officials disputed these accounts, saying that no such concerns were raised in National Security Council meetings and that Trump\u2019s focus was on urging Ukraine to root out corruption. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Once it became known that a whistleblower had complained about Trump\u2019s behavior... U.S. officials described an atmosphere of intense pressure inside the NSC and other departments since the existence of the whistleblower complaint became known, with some officials facing suspicion that they had a hand either in the complaint or in relaying damaging information to the whistleblower, whose identity has not been revealed and who is entitled to legal protection. One official \u2014 speaking, like others, on the condition of anonymity \u2014 described the climate as verging on \u201cbloodletting.\u201d Trump has fanned this dynamic with his own denunciations of the whistleblower and thinly veiled suggestions that the person should be outed. \u201cIs he on our Country\u2019s side. Where does he come from,\u201d Trump tweeted this week. The story also noted that Trump officials were concerned that the president\u2019s lawyer and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani was pursuing a \u201cshadow agenda\u201d with Ukraine that went against the administration\u2019s stance: \u201cRudy \u2014 he did all of this,\u201d one U.S. official said. \u201cThis s---show that we\u2019re in \u2014 it\u2019s him injecting himself into the process.\u201d Although impeachment appears to be preoccupying the president, his administration did announce some new policy today: The US Agency for International Development announced today that it will be more than tripling aid to Venezuela. For the first time, the US will be directly funding Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 in his bid to topple the socialist administration of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The AP reports: The funding was mostly repurposed from aid originally earmarked for Honduras and Guatemala that President Donald Trump cut last year after accusing the Central American countries of failing to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. The funding boost shows the level of U.S. support for Guaid\u00f3, who has drawn recognition as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader by more than 50 nations. But he has been unable to translate the international support and popularity at home into real power capable of helping regular Venezuelans suffering from hyperinflation and an economic collapse akin to the destruction wrought by war. Reports are trickling in that Donald Trump may allow congress to see the whistleblower report and meet with the whistleblower who filed a complaint having to do with Trump\u2019s efforts to get the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden and his son. The New York Times reports that the administration, which originally barred access to the whistleblower complaint, may be working on a deal to allow the whistleblower to meet with congress. Intelligence community lawyers sent a letter to the whistle-blower on Monday, indicating that the office was trying to work out the issues that would allow the whistle-blower to speak with Congress, according to a person briefed on the matter. Andrew P. Bakaj, a lawyer for the whistle-blower, had sent a letter to the director of national intelligence on Monday, saying that his client wanted to meet with members of Congress but needed the office\u2019s approval. Intelligence community lawyers have had discussions with the White House and the Justice Department officials about how the whistle-blower can share his complaint without infringing on issues like executive privilege. Politico is reporting that the White House may release the complaint to congress: The White House is preparing to release to Congress by the end of the week both the whistleblower complaint and the Inspector General report that are at the center of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, according to a senior administration official, reversing its position after withholding the documents from lawmakers. And according to NBC, Trump also called Pelosi in an attempt to get her to back away from impeachment: Democratic presidential candidates have backed Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement, including former secretary of housing and urban development Juli\u00e1n Castro: Senator Elizabeth Warren said she\u2019d vote to remove the president from office once the House votes to impeach him: Senator Cory Booker: Former representative from Texas Beto O\u2019Rourke: Senator Bernie Sanders: Senator Amy Klobuchar: Businessman Andrew Yang: Not every democratic 2020 candidate is on board. Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard, who has qualified for the next debate in October, told CNN that impeachment would be \u201cterribly divisive\u201d. And though Joe Biden said that Trump should be impeached if he continues to obstruct investigations, he stopped short of calling for an immediate impeachment. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s endorsement of an impeachment inquiry came about \u201cin the wake of allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate the son of Joe Biden, the former vice-president and the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to compete for the White House in the 2020 presidential election\u201d, The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino reports: Pelosi\u2019s change of heart come as Democrats from across the party amplified their calls from impeachment after revelations of a whistleblower complaint that the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog, Gen Michael Atkinson, deemed credible and an \u201curgent concern\u201d. The White House has refused to share the complaint with Congress as typically required by law, arguing that the allegations do not fall within the intelligence community whistleblower statute. For months Pelosi had stubbornly resisted calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment, telling colleagues at various points that the president is \u201cnot worth\u201d impeaching and that she would rather see him \u201cin prison\u201d than impeached. Meanwhile, the whistleblower has requested to speak to the House and Senate Intelligence committees, according to the attorney representing them. The House intelligence chairman Adam Schiff said: \u201cWe\u2018re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week.\u201d Senate leader Mitch McConnell has also responded to Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement, accusing House democrats of coming to a \u201cpredetermined conclusion.\u201d If congress votes to impeach the president, McConnell would be required to hold a trial in the Senate. But he could ensure that the proceedings are brief and limit democrats\u2019 arguments. At least two-thirds of the senate have to vote to remove the president from office. As The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy explains: \u201cAs things stand, for Trump\u2019s removal from office would thus require the partisan defection of about 20 Republican senators.\u201d Indeed, more than a dozen Democratic-led committees in congress have already been investigating Trump\u2019s businesses, his campaign and his conduct as president. Some investigations look to answer questions about whether Trump obstructed justice by interfering in the Russia probes, whether he inflated financial statements and whether he violated campaign finance rules. Others are probing Trump\u2019s rollback of environmental protections, his policy to separate migrant families at the border and his undermining of the Affordable Care Act. What Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement does is essentially make it \u201cofficial\u201d \u2014 framing these investigations as a way to suss out whether Trump can be charged with \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d, as the US Constitution puts it, and therefore should be removed from office. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said Nancy Pelosi \u201cdoes not speak for America on this issue,\u201d responding to Pelosi\u2019s announcement of an official impeachment inquiry, \u201cOur job is to legislate, not to continue to investigate,\u201d said the representative from California, adding that her announcement today \u201cchanges nothing\u201d as democrats have already been heavily investigating Trump. The Trump campaign is continuing to insist that the impeachment inquiry will help him win reelection. In a statement, Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said, \u201cThe misguided Democrat impeachment strategy is meant to appease their rabid, extreme, leftist base, but will only serve to embolden and energize President Trump\u2019s supporters and create a landslide victory for the President.\u201d Trump also tweeted out a campaign video, featuring a compilation of Democrats who support impeachment: Representative Al Green of Texas, who has been calling for impeachment for more than two years, says he feels \u201cvindicated\u201d by House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement today: The democratic congressman from Texas first called for Trump\u2019s impeachment in May 2017 \u2014 four months after Trump took office \u2014 after the president fired FBI director James Comey. Greetings from the West Coast bureau, as we pick up coverage. First, some background: To this date, no US president has been removed from office by impeachment Two presidents, Bill Clinton, in 1998, and Andrew Johnson, in 1868, were impeached \u2014 though both were acquitted by the senate. Richard Nixon resigned before he was formally impeached. The procedure for bringing articles of impeachment against presidents has varied as well, as HuffPost\u2019s Paul Blumenthal explains: That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi announced House Democrats are formally launching an impeachment inquiry against Trump. But it doesn\u2019t seem like that will have much of an impact on House Democrats\u2019 actual investigations, which will continue under the umbrella of a formal impeachment inquiry. Trump has already slammed the impeachment inquiry as a \u201cWitch Hunt.\u201d The Senate unanimously passed a resolution calling on the White House to release the whistleblower complaint that kicked off the controversy around Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman, said the whistleblower would like to testify to Congress and is conferring with the acting director of national intelligence on how to make that happen. Trump said he would release the transcript from the Ukraine call, but Democrats quickly said that would not be enough to satisfy their investigative demands. Joe Biden said Congress would be left with \u201cno choice\u201d but to initiate impeachment if Trump continued to obstruct House Democrats\u2019 investigations. Maanvi will have more on the latest impeachment developments, so stay tuned. Trump is already disparaging the impeachment inquiry as a \u201cWitch Hunt,\u201d the same derisive description he repeatedly applied to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. He has also resuscitated his claims that House Democrats\u2019 probes constitute \u201cpresidential harassment.\u201d Nancy Pelosi said Trump\u2019s actions represented a \u201cbetrayal of his oath of office, a betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\u201d \u201cTherefore, today, I\u2019m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,\u201d Pelosi said. But interestingly, the House speaker went on to say that six of the House Democratic committee chairs would continue their investigations into Trump under the umbrella of a formal impeachment inquiry. So it\u2019s unclear how this announcement will affect the actual work of the committees investigating the president. Trump has weighed in on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement that House Democrats are launching a formal impeachment inquiry, disparaging some of the committee chairs investigating him. The president is enjoying some \u201cexecutive time\u201d at Trump Tower after his day at the UN General Assembly, apparently allowing him to watch the House speaker\u2019s announcement. Nancy Pelosi condemned both Trump\u2019s alleged attempt to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his refusal to release the whistleblower complaint on the matter. On his denying House Democrats\u2019 request to see the complaint, Pelosi said, \u201cThis is a violation of law.\u201d The House speaker argued Trump\u2019s actions undermined national security and whistleblower protections. \u201cThe president must be held accountable,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d Nancy Pelosi has just confirmed that House Democrats are moving forward with a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump. Pelosi began her statement by noting last week\u2019s recognition of Constitution Day, which fell on the same day that reports first emerged about Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. \u201cThis is a breach of his constitutional responsibilities,\u201d Pelosi said of Trump reportedly pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden. Pelosi has started delivering her statement on the House Democrats\u2019 exploration of launching impeachment proceedings against Trump. It appears that the president himself has returned to Trump Tower, from the UN General Assembly, to tune in to Nancy Pelosi\u2019s 5 p.m. announcement. Meanwhile, over in the other chamber of Congress, the Senate has unanimously agreed to pass Chuck Schumer\u2019s resolution calling for the whistleblower complaint on the Ukraine controversy to be shared with the intelligence committees. Some expected Mitch McConnell to object to the resolution, but the Senate majority leader did not end up doing so. House Democrats have now gathered for their caucus meeting to discuss impeachment, and Nancy Pelosi will deliver a statement at 5 pm EST on the matter. But Pelosi is not expected to hold a press conference after making the statement, so she is unlikely to take questions on her position. Nancy Pelosi recently concluded a closed-door meeting with the Democratic chairs of six House committees: judiciary, intelligence, oversight, ways and means, financial services and foreign affairs. It appeared that the House speaker endorsed each of the committees continuing their investigations of Trump to determine whether to file articles of impeachment against the president, according to a CNN reporter. Joe Biden made a point in his statement on the Ukraine controversy to emphasize that Congress should only launch impeachment proceedings if Trump continues to obstruct House Democrats\u2019 investigations. \u201cThe president should stop stonewalling this investigation and all the other investigations of his wrongdoing,\u201d Biden said. \u201cUsing its full Constitutional authority, Congress should demand the information it has a legal right to receive. \u201cAnd if the President does not comply \u2014 if he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law \u2014 Donald Trump will leave Congress no choice but to initiate impeachment.\u201d This is a step short of calling for immediately initiating impeachment, and although it seems virtually certain that Trump will continue to obstruct the investigations, it will be interesting to see if Biden then forcefully comes out to demand that House Democrats follow through on his request. Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer have just confirmed that the House will vote on a resolution tomorrow condemning Trump\u2019s efforts to block the release of a whistleblower complaint about his call with the Ukrainian president. The House speaker and majority leader said in a statement: \u201cAllegations that the President of the United States sought to enlist a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by investigating one of his political rivals \u2013 and may have used the withholding of Congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance days earlier as intimidation \u2013 are deeply alarming. ... \u201cOn Wednesday, the House will vote on a resolution making it clear Congress\u2019s disapproval of the Administration\u2019s effort to block the release of the complaint and the need to protect the whistleblower. \u201cThis is not a partisan matter, it\u2019s about the integrity of our democracy, respect for the rule of law and defending our Constitution. We hope that all Members of the House \u2013 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2013 will join in upholding the rule of law and oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution as Representatives of the American people.\u201d Reporters are already gathering en masse outside Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office on Capitol Hill, hoping to get early confirmation that the House speaker is indeed launching a formal impeachment inquiry. Joe Biden has just finished issuing his statement on the Ukraine controversy, and, as expected, he said Congress would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to initiate impeachment proceedings if Trump continued to obstruct their investigations. Biden criticized the \u201cbaseless\u201d corruption claims Trump has leveled against him, but he emphasized the true danger in the president\u2019s actions were to the nation as a whole. \u201cI can take the political attacks. They\u2019ll come and they\u2019ll go, and in time they\u2019ll soon be forgotten,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cBut if we allow a president to get away with shredding the United States constitution, that will last forever.\u201d Biden concluded by saying that if Trump did not comply with the congressional requests, lawmakers would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to initiate impeachment proceedings. \u201cThat would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe know who Donald Trump is. It is time to let the world know who we are.\u201d The chair of the progressive group Democracy for America called on Nancy Pelosi to cancel the House recess next week and schedule an immediate vote on articles of impeachment against Trump. The chair, Charles Chamberlain, said in a statement: \u201cDonald Trump has committed clearly impeachable offenses and admitted to them in public. No further investigation is needed, and Trump\u2019s brazenly corrupt acts in the White House make it clear that he\u2019s an on-going threat to our national security. \u201cWe urge Speaker Pelosi to cancel next week\u2019s recess, and schedule a vote on Articles of Impeachment immediately.\u201d A co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus confirmed that House Democrats are unlikely to abandon their impeachment demands, even if Trump releases the transcript from his call with the Ukrainian president. In his latest tweet, Trump accused Democrats of being fixated on impeachment, to the detriment of their constituents. This charge seems a bit hypocritical, particularly on the issue of guns. Since last month\u2019s three mass shootings that left dozens dead, Trump has dragged his feet on specifying what type of gun legislation he would support, even though Mitch McConnell has repeatedly said he won\u2019t move forward without the president\u2019s endorsement. Meanwhile, House Democrats have repeatedly held hearings on gun control and urged McConnell to take up a background checks bill they passed earlier this year. Nancy Pelosi said at the Atlantic Festival that Trump called her earlier today to discuss gun legislation but that the conversation veered into \u201cother things.\u201d The House speaker would not clarify what those \u201cother things\u201d were. Nancy Pelosi clarified in her appearance at the Atlantic Festival that she did not consider \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to be the bar when it came to Trump allegedly pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden. The House speaker argued that the request on its own constituted incredibly problematic behavior for a president. Trump has repeatedly emphasized in his comments to reporters that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d in his conversation with the Ukrainian president. But if the transcript of the call reveals he did bring up Biden, as Trump had previously confirmed, that could be enough in the speaker\u2019s mind to merit further investigation. The Senate intelligence committee is reportedly seeking its own interview with the whistleblower who kicked off the Ukraine controversy. Yahoo News reports: A letter seeking to question the still-anonymous whistleblower was sent Tuesday to Andrew Bakaj, the lawyer who represents the official. It was signed by committee chair Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. \u2014 signifying that the panel is pursuing the politically explosive issue on a bipartisan basis. \u2018In order to ascertain the appropriate path forward for your client while protecting your client\u2019s privacy, we are writing to request that you make your client available for a closed bipartisan interview with Committee counsel no later than Friday, September 27, 2019, in a mutually agreeable secure location,\u2019 the letter reads. Members of the Blue Dog Coalition, a moderate group of House Democrats, are announcing their support for impeachment \u2013 a development that underscores how widespread these calls have become in the caucus. But the call for a select committee on impeachment is already being met with pushback from some House Democrats. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez warned in a tweet earlier today that such a move would hinder the investigation and create tension with the panels already probing the president\u2019s actions, namely the House judiciary committee. Nancy Pelosi appeared to hint at her leanings on impeachment when she told the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, \u201cAs soon as we have the facts, we\u2019re ready. Now we have the facts. We\u2019re ready.\u201d The House speaker then pivoted to reiterating that she would make a statement on her position later today, after meeting with her caucus, but the comment seemed to indicate she was supportive of launching an inquiry. Pelosi has previously been hesitant to back impeachment proceedings, arguing that Democrats needed to have the best possible case before moving forward. She now apparently thinks that they do. Nancy Pelosi intends to announce a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump later today, according to the Washington Post. The Post reports: The announcement later Tuesday from Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) comes amid reports that President Trump may have pressured a foreign leader to investigate former vice president and potential 2020 campaign rival Joe Biden and his family. A growing number of House Democrats are backing an impeachment inquiry as momentum shifts in the Democratic caucus. Democratic officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly, said she would back the step. Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said the whistleblower who first brought the Ukraine call into the news is open to testifying before Congress. But the California Democrat added that the whistleblower is conferring with acting director of national intelligence on how to testify. Nancy Pelosi similarly just confirmed, while speaking at the Atlantic Festival, that Trump releasing the transcript from the Ukraine call would not satisfy Democrats\u2019 investigation demands. Nancy Pelosi has appeared at the Atlantic Festival, but the House speaker is still clearly hesitant to invoke the i-word with Trump. She said she has tried to \u201cavoid\u201d an impeachment inquiry because it\u2019s a \u201cdivisive\u201d issue. She would only say that, if Trump did pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, then he was \u201cwrong.\u201d The California Democrat added to applause from the audience: \u201cThe president is making lawlessness a virtue.\u201d The release of the Ukraine call transcript is unlikely to quell Democrats\u2019 demands to launch an impeachment inquiry, given that they have also insisted on getting access to the initial whistleblower complaint that kicked off the controversy. Unless Trump also hands over that information, which seems unlikely, House Democrats will likely say that an inquiry is still necessary to get to the bottom of the controversy. Trump, who is attending the UN General Assembly in New York, has just announced on Twitter that he has authorized the release of the transcript from his phone call with the Ukrainian president. During the phone call, Trump allegedly pressured the Ukrainian president to launch an investigation into Joe Biden, a charge the US president has denied. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is now fundraising off the escalating calls among House Democrats for his impeachment. \u201cThe Democrats know they have no chance of winning in 2020, so now they are crying, \u2018Impeachment!\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign wrote in an email to supporters. It continued: \u201cThere are now over 150 House Democrats who back Impeachment. We CANNOT let these hateful and baseless attacks go on any longer.\u201d The effort to capitalize on Democrats\u2019 demands underscores Nancy Pelosi\u2019s concerns that moving forward with impeachment will spark public opposition and energize the right. Nancy Pelosi will soon appear at the Atlantic Festival, but the House speaker\u2019s deputy chief of staff also confirmed she would make a statement at 5 p.m. EST after meeting with her caucus. Bernie Sanders, who is campaigning in Iowa today, stopped short of calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment but reiterated his support for launching an inquiry. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd today, I hope very much that the judiciary committee will go forward with an impeachment inquiry.\u201d The Vermont senator still said impeachment was \u201clikely.\u201d House Democrats are reportedly planning to introduce a resolution tomorrow that would condemn Trump for allegedly trying to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden. But the resolution would not call for Trump\u2019s impeachment, an issue that Nancy Pelosi is discussing today with Democratic committee chairs and leaders, per Politico\u2019s congressional bureau chief. Nancy Pelosi has reportedly been exploring the creation of a select committee to investigate impeachment. The Washington Post reports: The California Democrat has spoken to key allies in recent days about establishing a special panel rather than leaving the task with the House Judiciary Committee, said several Democratic officials. Nothing has been decided, the individuals cautioned, but some members are expected to publicly endorse the move soon. ... The creation of a special committee is expected to come up at a series of Democratic meetings planned for Tuesday afternoon, when Pelosi will address her caucus on impeachment for the first time since the news about Trump\u2019s conversations with Ukraine broke. But some members of Pelosi\u2019s caucus, including representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are already pushing back against the possible creation of a select committee. They fear such a move could delay the investigation process and create friction with the committees already probing Trump\u2019s actions. A source close to Nancy Pelosi told an NBC News analyst that the House speaker will announce an impeachment inquiry and confirm her own support of launching proceedings in her statement later today. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: More House Democrats are coming out in favor of impeaching Trump, even those lawmakers who are from more conservative districts. The escalating support could put pressure on Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to give a statement later today, to back launching impeachment proceedings. Trump delivered his address to the UN General Assembly, in which he offered a wide-ranging (although somewhat low-energy) defense of his administration\u2019s foreign and domestic agendas. Trump also sat down with Boris Johnson, who is facing criticism back home after the UK supreme court ruled the prime minister\u2019s attempted suspension of parliament to force a no-deal Brexit was illegal. The blog is still tracking the latest developments on impeachment, so stay tuned. Representative Katie Hill \u2013 a first-term congresswoman from a district that flipped in 2018 and fierce ally of Nancy Pelosi \u2013 said on Tuesday: \u201cI strongly support the House of Representatives moving forward with impeachment proceedings \u2013\u2013 it is what the Constitution, my constituents, and my conscience demands.\u201d Hill previously said after special counsel Robert Mueller testified in July that she was \u201cwaiting until we have the STRONGEST possible case\u201d before backing impeachment. Apparently the Ukraine call tipped the scales for her. It appears a majority of House Democrats facing some of the toughest reelection races next year now favor impeachment, per a Politico reporter. Joe Biden is expected to give a statement about Trump allegedly pressuring Ukraine to investigate him at 2:30 p.m. EST. According to a source from Biden\u2019s campaign, the former vice president will call for impeachment if the White House does not hand over information about Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Representative John Lewis echoed the message from his House floor speech in a tweet calling for impeachment against Trump: Almost immediately after Lewis finished speaking, representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, put out a statement explaining her support for impeachment proceedings if the White House doesn\u2019t turn over information about the Ukraine call. Nancy Pelosi said she would make a statement later today, after meeting with House Democratic chairmen and leaders, as calls for impeachment intensify. The House speaker has previously been very cautious about backing impeachment, warning members of her caucus that they should have the best possible case against Trump before exploring such an option. But with House Democrats from more conservative districts coming out in favor of impeachment, Pelosi\u2019s calculus around protecting her most vulnerable members may have changed. Representative John Lewis, the veteran Democratic lawmaker and civil rights icon, has come out in favor of impeachment against Trump. \u201cI truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come,\u201d the Georgia Democrat said on the House floor. \u201cTo delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.\u201d He added: \u201cThe people of this nation realize that if they had committed even half of the possible violations, the federal government would be swift to seek justice.\u201d Lewis\u2019 announcement could trigger even more announcements of impeachment support, per a Politico reporter: Amid all of the news today, there are developments happening on the presidential campaign trail as well. Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October debate after receiving 2 percent in a Monmouth University poll of New Hampshire. But the bigger news from the New Hampshire poll may be Elizabeth Warren continuing to surge in the early voting states. Warren came out on top in the Monmouth poll, attracting the support of 27 percent of New Hampshire Democrats in comparison to Joe Biden\u2019s 25 percent. Similar to the Iowa poll released this weekend, Warren and Biden are head-and-shoulders above the rest of the field. The third-place finisher in the Monmouth poll, Bernie Sanders, attracted 12 percent. The dip in his support is pretty remarkable, given that the Vermont senator won the New Hampshire primary in 2016. In combination with a Nevada poll released earlier today, which also showed Biden and Warren leading the pack, the two are currently the unmistakable front-runners in the race. Another freshman House Democrat from a more conservative district, Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, has said she would be open to impeachment. According to a Politico reporter, the number of House Democrats open to supporting impeachment has reached 161, representing about two-thirds of the caucus. While meeting with Boris Johnson at the UN General Assembly, Trump reiterated his claim that he did not offer to release military aid to Ukraine if the country\u2019s president agreed to investigate Biden. The US president also repeated his argument, which he made for the first time earlier today, that he initially held back military aid from Ukraine over concerns about European allies not equally contributing. Climate activist Greta Thunberg has changed her Twitter bio to reflect Trump\u2019s mockery of her emotional address to the UN yesterday. Trump belittled the activist\u2019s condemnation of world leaders for their inaction on climate change by saying she seemed like a \u201cvery happy young girl.\u201d Thunberg has now embraced the titled by adding it to her Twitter bio. Democratic presidential candidates are lending their own voices to the impeachment debate, with several contenders reiterating their past comments that they support launching proceedings against Trump. It looks like more House Democrats are moving toward impeachment, per a New York Times reporter. Joe Biden is now expected to make a statement about Trump allegedly pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate him at 2:30pm ET. The blog is following news on multiple fronts today. Trump will meet with Boris Johnson in about 20 minutes, and House Democrats will have their caucus meeting this afternoon as impeachment talks intensify. But with Biden addressing the controversy, the Ukraine controversy is liking to remain the biggest story of the day \u2013 particularly with Trump acknowledging he did hold back military aid from the country. However, the president claimed today that he did so because of concerns about European allies not equally contributing. Trump has just wrapped up his speech to the UN General Assembly, which lasted about 37 minutes and covered a wide variety of topics. The president did not shy away from criticizing foreign adversaries, including China and Iran, and touted his administration\u2019s policies on issues like trade and immigration. In what will likely be one of the most-quoted lines of the speech, Trump defended his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda by saying, \u201cThe future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.\u201d Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Trump took aim at immigration advocates who have criticized his administration\u2019s policies, including family separations at the southern border, as cruel. The moderator of Face the Nation noted how much Trump\u2019s tone has shifted in his UN addresses: And a Washington Post reporter highlighted how the president has few foreign-policy achievements to tout nearly three years into his term: Trump threatened to escalate sanctions against Iran if the country continues its \u201cmenacing behavior.\u201d \u201cAll nations have a duty to act. No responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s blood lust,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted. They will be tightened.\u201d US-Iranian tensions have continued to rise since Trump scrapped the nuclear deal crafted by the Obama administration. Trump expressed support for crafting a new trade deal with the UK as the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, struggles to navigate Brexit. The UK supreme court ruled today that Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament, in an attempt to force a no-deal Brexit, was illegal. But Johnson said this morning he remained committed to leaving the European Union by the end of October. Trump is extensively criticizing China\u2019s trade practices in his address to the UN General Assembly, accusing the country of gaming the system and stealing intellectual property. The president showed no signs of backing down on his tariffs, even as US and Chinese negotiators plan to sit down for trade talks again next month. Trump also warned China to respect the democratic needs of Hong Kong, where demonstrators have launched a series of protests to push back against Chinese control. Trump is using his speech to the UN General Assembly to promote his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. \u201cThe future does not belong to globalists; the future belongs to patriots,\u201d Trump said. The president\u2019s use of the term \u201cglobalist\u201d is striking given complaints that its roots are anti-Semitic. He said his policies would allow for \u201cnational renewal.\u201d \u201cIf you want freedom, take pride in your country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty. If you want peace, love your nation.\u201d The president has started speaking at the UN General Assembly, where he is expected to tout his administration\u2019s handling of issues like trade and immigration. \u201cAt the center of our vision for national renewal is an ambitious campaign to reform international trade,\u201d Trump will say, according to excerpts released by the White House. \u201cFor decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in bad faith. As jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\u201d Trump will say on immigration: \u201cWhen you undermine border security you are undermining human rights and human dignity.\u201d Trump slammed calls for his impeachment, which are escalating among House Democrats, as \u201cnonsense.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous; it\u2019s a witch hunt,\u201d Trump told reporters at the UN General Assembly when asked about impeachment talks. He claimed Democrats were only pursuing impeachment because they feared they could not beat him in next year\u2019s election. The president then reiterated his expectation that a transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president would be released, but he was vague on a timeline for that. Trump specifically called out European allies for not offering more aid to Ukraine while speaking to reporters at the UN in New York. \u201cI want other countries to put up money. I think it\u2019s unfair that we put up the money,\u201d Trump said when asked why he reportedly instructed his acting chief of staff to hold back the military aid several days before his phone call with the Ukrainian president. Trump said he \u201clet it go\u201d once he had more conversations with advisers, noting that the $400 million in military aid was released to Ukraine earlier this month. But he singled out some of the United States\u2019 European allies in not pulling their fair weight. Trump said: \u201cGermany, France, other countries should put up money, and that\u2019s been my complaint from the beginning.\u201d Taking questions from reporters upon arrival to the UN General Assembly, Trump reiterated that Democrats should be investigating the unfounded corruption claims against Joe Biden and his son. The president went on to slam House Democrats\u2019 demands to investigate his phone call with the Ukrainian president as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d a phrase Trump repeatedly invoked to belittle special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe. Trump has arrived at the UN General Assembly and told reporters that he held back military aid from Ukraine because he felt allies should contribute more. \u201cI always ask, why are other allies in Europe not putting up money for Ukraine?\u201d Trump asked. The Washington Post reported yesterday that he instructed his acting chief of staff to hold back the aid several days before the phone call in which he allegedly pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden. More bad news for Trump: the president reportedly instructed his acting chief of staff to hold back military aid from Ukraine several days before the phone call in which he allegedly pressured the country\u2019s president to investigate Biden. The Washington Post reports: Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump\u2019s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They explained that the president had \u2018concerns\u2019 and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent. Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an \u2018interagency process\u2019 but to give them no additional information \u2014 a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11. Trump\u2019s order to withhold aid to Ukraine a week before his July 25 call with Volodymyr Zelensky is likely to raise questions about the motivation for his decision and fuel suspicions on Capitol Hill that Trump sought to leverage congressionally approved aid to damage a political rival. The latest domino to fall in the impeachment controversy is a Washington Post op-ed written by seven freshman House Democrats, all of whom have national security backgrounds and represent swing districts. The authors of the piece are Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. They write of reports that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden: If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense. We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of \u2018inherent contempt\u2019 and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security. ... These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do. It\u2019s worth noting that the op-ed does not explicitly call for immediately launching impeachment proceedings. All the same, the group\u2019s openness to impeachment is an unmistakable shot across the bow from the more centrist wing of the Democratic Party. Good morning, live blog readers! The UN General Assembly continues today in New York, and two of the most powerful and most controversial world leaders are set to meet at 11.15am ET: Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. The meeting between the pair comes as each faces potentially career-ending controversies back home. More Democrats are coming out in favor of launching impeachment proceedings against Trump, and the UK supreme court has just ruled that Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament to try to force a no-deal Brexit was illegal. Owen Bowcott and Severin Carrell have more on that latter development: The judgment from 11 justices on the UK\u2019s highest court follows an emergency three-day hearing last week that exposed fundamental legal differences over interpreting the country\u2019s unwritten constitution. ... [The president of the supreme court] said: \u2018This court has \u2026 concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty [ to suspend parliament] was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect should be quashed.\u2019 Johnson said this morning that, while he did \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d with the verdict, he would \u201crespect the judicial process\u201d. The prime minister also restated his commitment to Britain leaving the European Union by the end of October. Trump and Johnson will almost certainly be asked about their respective controversies when they sit down this morning, and the blog will cover that meeting live, so stay tuned. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will deliver remarks at the UN at 10.15am ET and meet with other world leaders, including India\u2019s Narendra Modi. Nancy Pelosi will speak at the Atlantic Festival, where she will likely be asked about the latest members of her caucus to come out in favor of impeachment. Two of Trump\u2019s primary challengers, Joe Walsh and Bill Weld, will attend a debate in New York tonight. (Mark Sanford declined the invitation to campaign in Iowa.) That\u2019s all still coming up.",

      "bodyText": "Jock Palfreeman\u2019s long-awaited liberty appears in serious jeopardy, after an extraordinary last-minute intervention from Bulgaria\u2019s chief prosecutor attempting to send him back to jail. The prosecutor general, Sotir Tsatsarov, made an application on Tuesday to Bulgaria\u2019s supreme court of cassation, the country\u2019s highest court, to revoke Palfreeman\u2019s parole. The 32-year-old Palfreeman was granted parole by a panel of three judges last Thursday, after serving 11 years of a 20-year sentence for fatally stabbing a 23-year-old law student, Andrei Monov, in the capital Sofia in 2007. Palfreeman has consistently maintained the murder was committed in self-defence. He was being held in immigration detention, awaiting a new Australian passport so he could return home from Bulgaria. Consular officials visited on Monday but without travel documents so he could not leave. Bulgaria has imposed strict conditions on Palfreeman\u2019s release, insisting he be driven straight from the detention centre to a flight out of the country. The legal validity of the prosecutor general\u2019s action is unclear, but Palfreeman\u2019s lawyer had urged Australia to move him quickly out of the country, saying he was in danger from state authorities. \u201cYour [Australian] authority needs to come here, take him with the car and put him on the plane,\u201d Kalin Angelov told the ABC. \u201cBecause in this moment of mass hysteria, I think he would be in some sort of danger. Even now I think he is in some sort of danger \u2026 from the authorities here.\u201d Jock Palfreeman, from Sydney, has consistently maintained he acted in self-defence in the early hours of 28 December 2007, after intervening to prevent Monov and a group of more than a dozen friends from attacking two Roma men in central Sofia. Palfreeman, then 21, pleaded not guilty to murdering Monov \u2013 he was carrying a large butterfly knife belonging to a friend with which he stabbed Monov in the side of his chest \u2013 but was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. The conviction and sentence were upheld by higher courts. Palfreeman said he\u2019d been carrying the knife because he\u2019d previously experienced violence in Sofia. While his parole has been greeted with elation by his family in Australia \u2013 his father, Simon Palfreeman, has said he was overjoyed at the unexpected news of his son\u2019s parole \u2013 it has been condemned by senior politicians in Bulgaria, including the dead man\u2019s father.

Their reports could help form articles of impeachment brought against the president. Launching an impeachment inquiry does not necessarily mean that the House will vote to charge the president with \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d, though that is the likely outcome of such a process. If the House does charge the president, the articles of impeachment would then be sent to the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans who rarely break with Trump. Pelosi\u2019s announcement follows allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a July phone call to investigate the son of Joe Biden, the former vice-president and the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to compete for the White House in the 2020 presidential election. Trump has admitted that he discussed Biden on a call with Zelenskiy but has denied any suggestion of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d, even as it was reported that he ordered his staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid to Ukraine days before his call with Zelenskiy. The allegations came to light after a whistleblower working in US intelligence filed a formal complaint reportedly related to the phone call. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to release the details of the complaint. Maguire is due to testify on Thursday, his deadline for turning over the whistleblower complaint to Congress. \u201cIn light of recent reporting on the whistleblower complaint, I want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,\u201d Maguire said in a statement on Tuesday evening. \u201cI look forward to working with the administration and Congress to find a resolution regarding this important matter.\u201d Trump on Tuesday ordered the unredacted transcript of his summer call with Zelenskiy to be released on Wednesday, the same day the pair are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the UN general assembly. \u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNo pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!\u201d There\u2019s no evidence to support Trump\u2019s repeated claim that Biden improperly used his position as vice president to fire a Ukrainian prosecutor to help his son. Later, Trump added: \u201cThey [the Ukrainian government] don\u2019t know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!\u201d Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Pelosi said Trump did not have to explicitly threaten aid to be guilty of an impeachable offense. \u201cThere is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,\u201d she said, adding that the \u201csequence\u201d of events suggested that the president acted improperly. Later that afternoon, the Senate, in a rare act of bipartisanship, unanimously approved a resolution calling for the DNI to turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress. Pelosi\u2019s change of heart came as Democrats from across the party amplified their calls from impeachment after revelations of the whistleblower complaint, which the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog, Gen Michael Atkinson, deemed credible and an \u201curgent concern\u201d. The White House has refused to share the complaint with Congress as typically required by law, arguing that the allegations do not fall within the intelligence community whistleblower statute. For months, Pelosi had stubbornly resisted calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment, telling colleagues at various points that the president was \u201cnot worth\u201d impeaching and that she would rather see him \u201cin prison\u201d than impeached. The House judiciary committee had been conducting an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d that centered on the revelations contained in the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, as well as several other allegations against Trump, his administration and his financial ties. But now the inquiry has the full support of the speaker, as well as several once reluctant members of Congress. Republicans said Pelosi\u2019s announcement was a rhetorical exercise. \u201cShe cannot unilaterally decide we\u2019re in an impeachment inquiry,\u201d the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said in brief remarks after Pelosi\u2019s address. \u201cWhat she said today made no difference with what\u2019s been going on.\u201d Adam Schiff, the head of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, said on Tuesday that the whistleblower would like to speak to the panel and had requested guidance from the Maguire on how to do so. Impeachment is a course of action with few precedents. Only two presidents have ever been impeached \u2013 Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither were convicted by the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned before a vote on impeachment in the full House could be taken. In the 24 hours preceding Pelosi\u2019s formal address, dozens of Democrats, including those in districts that voted for Trump, endorsed a plan to move forward with impeachment. Pelosi informed a Democratic caucus meeting on Capitol Hill on Tuesday afternoon of her plans. \u201cThere is really no other remedy other than impeachment,\u201d said the congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, a Washington progressive and an early backer of impeaching the president. But not all Democrats support impeachment. Congressman Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said an impeachment inquiry would distract from Democrats\u2019 legislative priorities and deepen the political divides in the country. \u201cI want to do what\u2019s right. I don\u2019t want to tear the country apart,\u201d he told reporters after the closed-door meeting. \u201cThe majority of Americans, at this point in time, do not want to see this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A senior Queensland public servant accused of rigging tenders to disadvantage a charity was swiftly cleared of wrongdoing by her own department last month, just days after the departure of the department\u2019s integrity manager who had been pushing for an external investigation. The state\u2019s corruption watchdog found prima facie evidence of alleged corrupt conduct by the public servant, who works in the Department of Child Safety, Youth and Women. She has been accused of misusing her authority to withdraw funding from a Cairns-based charity, Choice Australia Management Pty Ltd, which claims it was unfairly blacklisted for government grants over several years. In June, the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) ordered an investigation into the actions of the public servant, to be conducted by the child safety department\u2019s professional standards unit. Documents seen by Guardian Australia show the professional standards unit manager, Scott Tan, then flagged he would recommend an external inquiry \u201cto ensure transparency\u201d. In a phone call with the Choice chief executive officer, Todd Hartley, in July, Tan stated he would argue that an outside body should conduct an investigation or review of the evidence. Tan was transferred to an equivalent role in another department on 29 July. Eleven days later, the child safety department wrote to Hartley and claimed the professional standards unit had reviewed the complaint \u201cin full\u201d and that the matter was now to be closed. \u201cAs a result of that review, professional standards has determined that there is insufficient evidence to support the allegation and, therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated,\u201d the letter said. Hartley has lodged new complaints with the CCC and the Queensland ombudsman about the process. These complaints arrive amid criticism of the way corruption investigations are handled in Queensland, where the state\u2019s corruption watchdog operates under a \u201cdevolution principle\u201d, which means it only handles the most serious or systemic corruption investigations. In an overwhelming majority of instances, even when clear evidence of corruption exists, public sector agencies are tasked with investigating their own staff. There is growing concern that the process results in poor outcomes and enables systemic corruption. Hartley said the process appeared to be \u201ca wall of dishonesty designed to protect [public servants] and break the spirit of those who commit to hold them to account\u201d. In an ongoing civil court action, Choice alleges it consistently won funding and was acclaimed for its programs, which support disadvantaged people, youth and the unemployed, until 2011. That year Hartley complained that a bureaucrat had made racist comments. Choice alleges it has been repeatedly rejected for funding in retribution for lodging the complaint. In documents filed in the Queensland district court, Choice is seeking more than $700,000 in damages for \u201cmalfeasance in public office\u201d.

Complaints of this nature are usually reported to Congress within seven days.

Biden was vice-president at the time.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s push for the Bidens to be investigated relates to the prosecutor\u2019s removal.

Complaints of this nature are usually reported to Congress within seven days. Maguire, who was appointed by Trump, has refused to do so. What happened on the call? Numerous news outlets have reported that Trump pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked Zelenskiy eight times to investigate Hunter Biden. On Sunday, Trump confirmed he discussed the Bidens with Zelenskiy, and accused the pair \u2013 without offering any evidence \u2013 of corruption. \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place,\u201d he said. \u201cWas largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice-President Biden and his son, [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d Why is Ukraine involved? There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Joe Biden or Hunter Biden. The allegations relate to Biden Jr\u2019s time on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, which was owned by a businessman who was being investigated by Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor. In 2016 the US and a number of other western countries pressured Ukraine to remove the prosecutor. Biden was vice-president at the time. Trump\u2019s push for the Bidens to be investigated relates to the prosecutor\u2019s removal. Trump\u2019s assertions appear to be politically motivated. Joe Biden is favorite to win the Democratic nomination for president and polls show him beating Trump comfortably. Why is this so serious? It is illegal for a political campaign to accept a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign government. Democrats say an investigation into a political opponent \u2013 for which Trump appears to have been pushing \u2013 would amount to a thing of value. It has also been suggested that Trump may have threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine. About a month after the call, the US delayed $250m in such assistance. The money was released this month, after the existence of the whistleblower complaint became public. On Monday, at the United Nations in New York, Trump said of the call: \u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption. If you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? \u2026 It\u2019s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d The following day, the president confirmed that he had withheld military aid \u2013 but claimed he did so over concerns the US was contributing more than its fair share compared with other countries. Trump also continued to seek to cast doubt on the whistleblower\u2019s motivations, tweeting: \u201cWho is this so-called \u2018whistleblower\u2019 who doesn\u2019t know the correct facts. Is he on our country\u2019s side. Where does he come from?\u201d Will the Trump-Zelenskiy transcript be released? Amid the growing calls for an impeachment inquiry, Trump on Tuesday tweeted that he had ordered the release of an unredacted transcript of the call the following day. Democrats are arguing that in addition to the transcript of the call, the full whistleblower complaint should be released to Congress. What are Democrats saying? The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, on Tuesday announced the US House of Representatives would begin a formal impeachment inquiry into the president. \u201cThe actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the constitution,\u201d Pelosi said in a formal address in Washington on Tuesday evening. \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Pelosi had long resisted pressure from the Democratic rank-and-file to impeach Trump over his links to Russia. But the Ukraine revelations only intensified calls for impeachment. Also on Tuesday, the Senate unanimously approved a Democratic resolution calling for the DNI to turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress. This story was updated on Tuesday 24 September with Pelosi\u2019s announcement and other political developments.",

Data released to senator Rex Patrick shows the department failed to process 11,131 of the 36,126 FOI requests within the standard 30-day statutory timeframe in the past two years. That\u2019s almost one in every three FOI requests received. Typically, when the initial time limit expires, the department can seek an extension, either from the applicant or the information watchdog.

In a statement to local media, Selangor police confirmed the three men had been shot dead, and claimed officers acted in self-defence because one of the men had opened fire during the chase. However, the family dispute the account of events and the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia is now investigating whether there has been an \u201cabuse of power\u2019 by police. Police named the two Malaysian men, Thavaselvan Govindasamy and Mahendran Santhira Segaran, as members of the \u201c08\u201d gang, which it said was wanted for a series of robberies. They said the third, UK resident Janarthanan Vijayaratnam, had overstayed his visa. Vijayaratnam\u2019s family has strongly contested police claims, saying key facts did not add up.

However, police later denied a fourth individual was involved. The family question whether that fourth person initially mentioned may have been Vijayaratnam\u2019s wife, Moganambal Govindasamy, a 35-year-old Malaysian national and UK resident, who had joined the three men for dinner and has been missing since. Her sister, Vasanthi Govindasamy, said Moganambal had shared a GPS location with her via WhatsApp at 1.38am on 14 September, something she had never done before and that caused her to believe her sister was in danger. That morning the family went to the location where they found a car, a white Perodua Alza the family had rented, and which the four had driven to dinner on Friday night. Kumar claimed the Malaysian police did not investigate the vehicle. \u201cWhy was there no forensic investigation? Why weren\u2019t fingerprints taken? Instead, the rental company just took it back,\u201d he said. The couple, who lived in Portsmouth, had been in Malaysia since 27 August for a holiday with their children. The youngest child, aged five, holds a British passport. A spokesperson for the UK\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: \u201cOur staff are providing assistance to the family of a British child following an incident in Batu Arang, Malaysia and are in contact with both the British and Malaysian authorities.\u201d Police claimed that Vijayaratnam was not a UK resident and that there was no record of him entering Malaysia. However, the Guardian has seen receipts for return flights from London to Kuala Lumpur for the family, matching luggage tags. Income tax and council tax bills sent to the couple at a Portsmouth address also indicate the couple were living and working there. The Guardian spoke to another family friend in the UK who confirmed the family had lived in Portsmouth for more than 10 years. The Guardian called the Selangor police headquarters three times for comment but officers hung up each time upon hearing the case in question. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam) said it would investigate the deaths of the three men and the alleged disappearance of the fourth. \u201cOur concern is whether there was abuse of power by the police. Suhakam will investigate the shooting and also the missing person,\u201d said commissioner Gerald Joseph. According to the family\u2019s lawyer, the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur is facilitating the return of the three minors to the UK with their paternal grandparents.
