      "body": "<h2>1) Spurs must improve in derby</h2> <p>When did Tottenham last play well in a league game? Arguably not since their Boxing Day thrashing of Bournemouth, a win they followed up with a drab home defeat to Wolves three days later. The latter display became far too commonplace as the campaign rolled on, with a light squad wearied by the run to the Champions League final and possibly distracted by Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s grumbling in public. Pochettino has seemed unsettled for a while and last weekend\u2019s defeat by Newcastle means Tottenham have lost 15 league games in 2019.</p> <p>A massive improvement is required for the trip to Arsenal, though that will probably only be achievable if Pochettino restores Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen to the starting lineup. The threat posed by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette in Arsenal\u2019s attack means that Vertonghen should replace the jittery Davinson S\u00e1nchez in defence, while Tottenham\u2019s creative struggles against Newcastle were a reminder of what they would be losing if Eriksen is sold before the European transfer window shuts on 2 September. <strong>JS</strong></p> <h2><strong>2) Lingard feels the heat</strong></h2> <p>Despite his public claims to the contrary, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r must be concerned about the poor form of Jesse Lingard. The Manchester United midfielder has provided no assists and just one goal in his past 20 appearances, a worrying return from exactly 22 hours spent on the pitch.</p> <p>While Solskj\u00e6r says Lingard has \u201cbeen a big part of our team and will continue being an important part\u201d, he had no compunction in replacing the 26-year-old with Mason Greenwood after 55 minutes of United\u2019s match against Crystal Palace last weekend. At Southampton, the 17-year-old is likely to start in place of the injured Anthony Martial and with Alexis S\u00e1nchez gone on loan to Inter, it will be no surprise to see the berth behind Greenwood occupied by Juan Mata. <strong>BG</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/aug/29/bury-carabao-upsets-and-the-alexis-sanchez-mystery-football-weekly-extra\">Bury, Carabao upsets and the Alexis S\u00e1nchez mystery \u2013 Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3) Hornets require lift-off</h2> <p>The only team not to collect a Premier League point, Watford are rock bottom of the table and will play a Newcastle side buoyed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/tottenham-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">last weekend\u2019s win at Spurs</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/27/carabao-cup-round-up-norwich-dumped-crawley\">3-0 Carabao Cup win for Watford</a> against Coventry in midweek was expected but it did also provide a ray of hope for the Hornets going forward, in the form of their record \u00a330m signing Isma\u00efla Sarr, who made his full debut after missing pre-season due to international commitments. The Senegalese winger is outrageously talented but also looks as though he\u2019s got the mental fortitude to thrive in the English game, dealing with some ugly early challenges before going on to score. \u201cTheir full-back hit him a couple of times,\u201d said Adrian Mariappa. \u201cI think it was a, \u2018Hello, welcome to England\u2019 sort of thing. He got up, dusted himself down and showed what a player he is.\u201d Without the injured Troy Deeney, Javi Gracia will surely be desperate to get Sarr into the XI for the trip to St James\u2019 Park. <strong>MB</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e64f03cc6706fb8fbe6bf9f82395cbb17e45407\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e64f03cc6706fb8fbe6bf9f82395cbb17e45407/0_154_4625_2775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isma\u00efla Sarr celebrating while playing for Watford against Coventry City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isma\u00efla Sarr (right) was on fine form against Coventry City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linnea Rheborg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) British youngsters can shine at the King Power</h2> <p>Most of the focus will be on the wonderful James Maddison when Leicester host Bournemouth, but the midfielder will not be the only young British talent hoping to catch the eye at the King Power Stadium. For Leicester, Hamza Choudhury will hope to continue his impressive start to the season in central midfield and Harvey Barnes will hope he has done enough to earn a rare start after coming off the bench to score the winner against Sheffield United. As for Bournemouth, a couple of Welsh youngsters have caught the eye, with Chris Mepham making two starts in central defence and the on-loan Liverpool midfielder Harry Wilson scoring a spectacular free-kick against Manchester City last week. With Brendan Rodgers at Leicester and Eddie Howe at Bournemouth, youngsters at both clubs should continue to flourish. <strong>JS</strong></p> <h2><strong>5) Morrison edges closer for Blades</strong></h2> <p>Chris Wilder was grumpy after his team\u2019s defeat at the hands of Leicester and his mood will hardly have been improved by his decision not to bother going to Headingley the next day despite having a ticket for what turned out to be a quite remarkable day of Ashes cricket. A midweek Carabao Cup win over Blackburn will have put the smile back on his face, not least because Ravel Morrison excelled in a Sheffield United lineup featuring 10 changes. \u201cThere\u2019s still a little way for him to go,\u201d said Wilder, upon being asked about Morrison\u2019s fitness. \u201cBut he\u2019s within touching distance of it now and he\u2019ll bring a lot to the table for us.\u201d Whether the brooding, enigmatic midfielder starts against Chelsea remains to be seen, but he seems sure to play some part.

Burnley\u2019s fibrous, streetwise approach make them the closest the modern footballer will get to playing Wimbledon at Plough Lane. Liverpool were beaten in 2016-17, needed an injury-time winner from Ragnar Klavan in 2017-18 and came from behind to win last season. That match is best remembered for Joe Gomez suffering a fractured leg after a strong but fair tackle from Ben Mee. After the match there was a full and frank exchange of views between Sean Dyche and J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who criticised Burnley\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d approach. Dyche also accused Daniel Sturridge of diving during that game, and it\u2019s not hard to imagine a scenario whereby both teams ascend the moral high ground once again. Liverpool will doubtless highlight Burnley\u2019s robust approach, while Dyche\u2019s recent comments on diving will reappear should Mohamed Salah have any gravitational issues. <strong>RS</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/tyrone-mings-england-call-up-aston-villa\">Tyrone Mings call-up by England makes up for early series of rejections</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>7) Everton need forwards to deliver \u2026</h2> <p>Everton have only scored once in their first three league games, a poor return for a side hoping to break into the top six this season. Despite another impressive outlay in the summer they still lack a clinical finisher and although Marco Silva has plenty of options in the forward positions, this squad\u2019s edge remains blunted by the sale of Romelu Lukaku to United two years ago. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has not scored since March and Moise Kean will need time to settle in England after his move from Juventus. Not that it is just down to the strikers. If Silva\u2019s attack is malfunctioning, then the creative players also need to accept some of the blame. After all Gylfi Sigurdsson has only passed to Calvert-Lewin three times this season and Alex Iwobi, a \u00a334m summer signing from Arsenal, often flattered to deceive in the final third for his previous club. Everyone needs to step up against Wolves.<strong> JS</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11ae204fcdd6006ec1d68135986c4d831f83a607\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11ae204fcdd6006ec1d68135986c4d831f83a607/0_350_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moise Kean playing for Everton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moise Kean arrived from Juventus during the summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8) <strong>\u2026 and so do Crystal Palace</strong></h2> <p>Crystal Palace are crying out for a striker that is even remotely prolific and in Christian Benteke, Connor Wickham and Jordan Ayew don\u2019t appear to have one that readily fits the bill. Benteke\u2019s struggles in front of goal have been well documented, the injury-plagued Wickham has never particularly convinced in the top flight, and Ayew has just two Premier League goals to his name in a little over a season at Palace. The Ghanaian international got off the mark for this season at Old Trafford but will need to chip in with plenty more if he is to justify the faith that prompted Roy Hodgson to offer him a three-year deal this summer. Bagging his second in two games against his former club Aston Villa would go some way towards doing so. <strong>BG</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/champions-league-group-guide-liverpool-spurs-manchester-city-chelsea\">Champions League group-by-group guide: predictions and star players</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>9) Norwich defence can still improve</h2> <p>The league table never lies.

      "bodyText": "1) Spurs must improve in derby When did Tottenham last play well in a league game? Arguably not since their Boxing Day thrashing of Bournemouth, a win they followed up with a drab home defeat to Wolves three days later. The latter display became far too commonplace as the campaign rolled on, with a light squad wearied by the run to the Champions League final and possibly distracted by Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s grumbling in public. Pochettino has seemed unsettled for a while and last weekend\u2019s defeat by Newcastle means Tottenham have lost 15 league games in 2019. A massive improvement is required for the trip to Arsenal, though that will probably only be achievable if Pochettino restores Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen to the starting lineup. The threat posed by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette in Arsenal\u2019s attack means that Vertonghen should replace the jittery Davinson S\u00e1nchez in defence, while Tottenham\u2019s creative struggles against Newcastle were a reminder of what they would be losing if Eriksen is sold before the European transfer window shuts on 2 September. JS 2) Lingard feels the heat Despite his public claims to the contrary, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r must be concerned about the poor form of Jesse Lingard. The Manchester United midfielder has provided no assists and just one goal in his past 20 appearances, a worrying return from exactly 22 hours spent on the pitch. While Solskj\u00e6r says Lingard has \u201cbeen a big part of our team and will continue being an important part\u201d, he had no compunction in replacing the 26-year-old with Mason Greenwood after 55 minutes of United\u2019s match against Crystal Palace last weekend. At Southampton, the 17-year-old is likely to start in place of the injured Anthony Martial and with Alexis S\u00e1nchez gone on loan to Inter, it will be no surprise to see the berth behind Greenwood occupied by Juan Mata. BG 3) Hornets require lift-off The only team not to collect a Premier League point, Watford are rock bottom of the table and will play a Newcastle side buoyed by last weekend\u2019s win at Spurs. A 3-0 Carabao Cup win for Watford against Coventry in midweek was expected but it did also provide a ray of hope for the Hornets going forward, in the form of their record \u00a330m signing Isma\u00efla Sarr, who made his full debut after missing pre-season due to international commitments. The Senegalese winger is outrageously talented but also looks as though he\u2019s got the mental fortitude to thrive in the English game, dealing with some ugly early challenges before going on to score. \u201cTheir full-back hit him a couple of times,\u201d said Adrian Mariappa. \u201cI think it was a, \u2018Hello, welcome to England\u2019 sort of thing. He got up, dusted himself down and showed what a player he is.\u201d Without the injured Troy Deeney, Javi Gracia will surely be desperate to get Sarr into the XI for the trip to St James\u2019 Park. MB 4) British youngsters can shine at the King Power Most of the focus will be on the wonderful James Maddison when Leicester host Bournemouth, but the midfielder will not be the only young British talent hoping to catch the eye at the King Power Stadium. For Leicester, Hamza Choudhury will hope to continue his impressive start to the season in central midfield and Harvey Barnes will hope he has done enough to earn a rare start after coming off the bench to score the winner against Sheffield United. As for Bournemouth, a couple of Welsh youngsters have caught the eye, with Chris Mepham making two starts in central defence and the on-loan Liverpool midfielder Harry Wilson scoring a spectacular free-kick against Manchester City last week. With Brendan Rodgers at Leicester and Eddie Howe at Bournemouth, youngsters at both clubs should continue to flourish. JS 5) Morrison edges closer for Blades Chris Wilder was grumpy after his team\u2019s defeat at the hands of Leicester and his mood will hardly have been improved by his decision not to bother going to Headingley the next day despite having a ticket for what turned out to be a quite remarkable day of Ashes cricket.

Benteke\u2019s struggles in front of goal have been well documented, the injury-plagued Wickham has never particularly convinced in the top flight, and Ayew has just two Premier League goals to his name in a little over a season at Palace.

      "bodyText": "Hospital patients\u2019 safety is being put at risk by fires, floods and crumbling, overcrowded buildings caused by a \u00a34bn government squeeze on capital funding, NHS bosses are warning. Hospitals say they do not have the funding to replace outdated scanners, fix leaking roofs and boilers, or remove ligature points that suicidal patients may attempt to use to try to end their lives. Four out of five (82%) chief executives and chief finance officers at NHS trusts in England fear the lack of capital funding poses a medium or high risk to patient safety. Almost all (97%) of the 161 bosses surveyed by NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospital and ambulance services, are worried by how much money their trust needs to undertake urgent repairs. Almost as many (94%) are concerned their inability to tackle problems is affecting patients\u2019 experiences of care. Separately, Kettering general hospital said increasing demand meant its A&amp;E unit was often so overcrowded that staff could not clearly see some of the sickest patients, making proper monitoring of their conditions difficult. The unit was built in 1994 to handle 110 patients a day but now treats as many as 300 during busy periods.

NHS chiefs\u2019 concern over the mounting disruption, linked to a lack of capital funding, comes after ministers diverted more than \u00a34bn of those funds into the NHS\u2019s revenue budget in recent years to help pay for day-to-day running costs. It emerged this week Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS trust has had to close four wards, a total of 120 beds, in the Sir Robert Hadfield wing of the Northern general hospital, since last November because the fire brigade deemed the facilities a fire risk and issued a prohibition order. The Health Service Journal also said two wards in a major trauma unit at Oxford University Hospitals trust have been closed since the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, over concerns the building\u2019s cladding is inadequate. The 52 beds, however, have been provided elsewhere on-site and the major trauma service is operating as normal. This month, Boris Johnson promised \u00a31.8bn in extra capital funding for the NHS to fund upgrades at 20 trusts and build new facilities. However, NHS Providers said this could \u201conly be considered a first down payment of the NHS\u2019s needs\u201d. It has a \u00a36bn maintenance backlog, of which \u00a31bn is needed to urgently tackle problems threatening patient safety. Before next week\u2019s spending review, NHS Providers wants ministers to bring forward a multiyear capital funding settlement and commit to increasing the proportion of GDP spent on health infrastructure from 0.3% to the 0.6%, as is the case in comparable countries. Since 2017 St Mary\u2019s hospital in London has been affected by floods, electrical issues and drainage problems. It has included a ceiling collapsing in an elderly care ward and maternity services being relocated because of a fault with a lift. In addition, 20 surgical beds and two operating theatres had to close for two weeks owing to flooding and it has been unable to use the 32 beds in its Grafton ward since May 2018 because the floor is too weak to support them. The archaic nature of much of the estate at Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust, which runs St Mary\u2019s and four other hospitals, means its maintenance backlog would cost \u00a31.3bn to clear. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe recently gave the NHS an extra \u00a31.8bn of new funding to invest in frontline facilities, including 20 new hospital upgrades across the country. \u201cWe\u2019re also going to be taking a more strategic approach with a new health infrastructure plan that will set the priorities for the NHS over the long term.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2019 to reflect an amendment to the HSJ article clarifying the status of the major trauma unit at the Oxford University Hospitals trust.",

These ideas are also central to the illegal practices that disproportionately affect girls, such as child labour, child marriage and early pregnancy.</p> <p>Turning Promises Into Action, <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2018/sdg-report-summary-gender-equality-in-the-2030-agenda-for-sustainable-development-2018-en.pdf?la=en&amp;vs=949\" rel=\"nofollow\">a September 2018 report published by UN Women</a> found that 15 million girls of primary-school age won\u2019t have the chance to learn to read or write, compared with 10 million boys. It also found that factors that are shaping the present - such as climate change and exclusionary politics - are worsening the circumstances under which many women and girls live.</p> <p>But there\u2019s the potential for change. World Vision Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.worldvision.com.au/global-issues/work-we-do/refugees/how-australians-stood-up-for-girls\" rel=\"nofollow\">1000 Girls</a>, an initiative that asks Australians to join a movement to sponsor 1000 girls across developing countries by the International Day of the Girl on 11 October, aims to break this cycle of gender inequality. It also proves that a small commitment can make a seismic impact on a girl\u2019s power to dictate the terms of her own life.</p> <p>Here are some of the challenges that girls around the world are grappling with - as well as how, with the support of World Vision, girls could access the resources to find their way out.</p> <p>The inequality and disadvantages that girls face stem from three interworven causes: child marriage, child pregnancy and child labour, all of which are exacerbated by poverty and have insidious consequences on the outcomes of these girls\u2019 lives. We take a look at how this plays out in reality.</p> <h2>Entrenched poverty and cultural pressure in parts of India are holding back efforts to end child marriage</h2> <p>Marriage, at least in its modern context, is a union between two people who have freely chosen to intertwine their lives together. But in parts of India, one in four young women are married before their 18th birthday, according to February 2019 UNICEF statistics. Although the country\u2019s 1929 Child Marriage Restraint Act prohibits child marriage, complex factors such as entrenched poverty, caste pressure to marry during puberty and <em>atta-satta</em>, a custom that casts young girls as part of the exchange of household labour between families, means that this arcane practice still persists.</p> <p>When Vimlesh was growing up in the state of Uttar Pradesh, she was married to Jahawar as a 14-year-old and forced to drop out of high school to run her new household. Luckily, she chose a different fate for her daughters, Varsha and Ashu. Instead of finding husbands, the sisters are focused on honing their natural talents, building their confidence and furthering their education. They are part of the Smart Child program, a World Vision initiative that screens sponsored children for signs of abuse, establishes trust among the local community and cultivates leadership skills and self-worth. For Varsha, a natural at painting and mathematics, this has opened a window to the future. She\u2019s passionate about social change and hopes to be working at a bank in Agra in 10 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50591795a5ed7bbce8b2f751b2dd87d58de7990e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50591795a5ed7bbce8b2f751b2dd87d58de7990e/0_0_5721_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Varsha is passionate about social change and hopes to be working at a bank in Agra in ten years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Varsha is passionate about social change and hopes to be working at a bank in Agra in ten years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Lee/2016 World Vision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Varsha is passionate about social change and hopes to be working at a bank in Agra in ten years. Photograph: Eugene Lee/World Vision</p></li> </ul> <h2>In Kenya young women\u2019s health is being put in jeopardy through childhood pregnancy</h2> <p>Throughout history, pregnancy has posed risks to women\u2019s health. According to <a href=\"https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2204-z\" rel=\"nofollow\">a February 2019 study in the journal BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,</a> pregnancy-related conditions are the second biggest cause of death of adolescent girls in developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. Early pregnancy also disrupts girls\u2019 schooling and destroys the chances that they will improve the material conditions of their lives by limiting their ability to work.</p> <p>In Kenya, Cherop, a bright young girl with aspirations of becoming a doctor, was taken out of school and married off as a 14-year-old; the money from her dowry was used to pay her brother\u2019s school fees.

      "bodyText": "We explore the damaging forces that prevent girls in the developing world realising their full potential - as well as what you can do to help Gender inequality is a global issue, and in many developing countries, the lives of millions of girls are shaped by gender roles that have been entrenched over generations. Whether it\u2019s the belief that sisters are less deserving of an education than their brothers, or that the defining female duty is as a mother or caregiver, these ideas don\u2019t just affect girls\u2019 quality of life or rob them of the power to control their own destinies. These ideas are also central to the illegal practices that disproportionately affect girls, such as child labour, child marriage and early pregnancy. Turning Promises Into Action, a September 2018 report published by UN Women found that 15 million girls of primary-school age won\u2019t have the chance to learn to read or write, compared with 10 million boys. It also found that factors that are shaping the present - such as climate change and exclusionary politics - are worsening the circumstances under which many women and girls live. But there\u2019s the potential for change. World Vision Australia\u2019s 1000 Girls, an initiative that asks Australians to join a movement to sponsor 1000 girls across developing countries by the International Day of the Girl on 11 October, aims to break this cycle of gender inequality. It also proves that a small commitment can make a seismic impact on a girl\u2019s power to dictate the terms of her own life. Here are some of the challenges that girls around the world are grappling with - as well as how, with the support of World Vision, girls could access the resources to find their way out. The inequality and disadvantages that girls face stem from three interworven causes: child marriage, child pregnancy and child labour, all of which are exacerbated by poverty and have insidious consequences on the outcomes of these girls\u2019 lives. We take a look at how this plays out in reality. Entrenched poverty and cultural pressure in parts of India are holding back efforts to end child marriage Marriage, at least in its modern context, is a union between two people who have freely chosen to intertwine their lives together. But in parts of India, one in four young women are married before their 18th birthday, according to February 2019 UNICEF statistics. Although the country\u2019s 1929 Child Marriage Restraint Act prohibits child marriage, complex factors such as entrenched poverty, caste pressure to marry during puberty and atta-satta, a custom that casts young girls as part of the exchange of household labour between families, means that this arcane practice still persists. When Vimlesh was growing up in the state of Uttar Pradesh, she was married to Jahawar as a 14-year-old and forced to drop out of high school to run her new household. Luckily, she chose a different fate for her daughters, Varsha and Ashu. Instead of finding husbands, the sisters are focused on honing their natural talents, building their confidence and furthering their education. They are part of the Smart Child program, a World Vision initiative that screens sponsored children for signs of abuse, establishes trust among the local community and cultivates leadership skills and self-worth. For Varsha, a natural at painting and mathematics, this has opened a window to the future. She\u2019s passionate about social change and hopes to be working at a bank in Agra in 10 years.

Photograph: Eugene Lee/World Vision In Kenya young women\u2019s health is being put in jeopardy through childhood pregnancy Throughout history, pregnancy has posed risks to women\u2019s health. According to a February 2019 study in the journal BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, pregnancy-related conditions are the second biggest cause of death of adolescent girls in developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. Early pregnancy also disrupts girls\u2019 schooling and destroys the chances that they will improve the material conditions of their lives by limiting their ability to work. In Kenya, Cherop, a bright young girl with aspirations of becoming a doctor, was taken out of school and married off as a 14-year-old; the money from her dowry was used to pay her brother\u2019s school fees. She endured intense pain during her pregnancy and eventually collapsed in hospital, nearing the brink of death. But with the help of doctors, Cherop, who is being sponsored by World Vision Hong Kong, was able to safely deliver her baby. She now lives in a rescue centre at Kenya\u2019s Morpheus Primary School and vows to fight for other girls facing the same ordeal.

Right from the start, I said, guys, are you OK with this?\u201d The answer was yes and about a year later, What Girls Are Made Of debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe with her old band in the audience. When Bissett takes the play back to the Edinburgh Fringe this year, ahead of her trip to Melbourne, her old schoolmate and Darlingheart drummer, Cathryn Stirling, will join the cast. \u201cCathryn and I are still friends. The actor we had playing her had some other commitments, so I called up Cathryn and said, how do you fancy coming and playing yourself for a week? She jumped at the chance. That has been really lovely, rehearsing again with her. It\u2019s been 25 years since I turned around and saw Cathryn on a drum kit behind me.\u201d With the benefit of hindsight, is there anything Bissett would do differently? \u201cAh, God, you can\u2019t regret these things,\u201d she says. \u201cI was quite a sensitive, anxious teen. I really worried about what I was giving to the world. I think I would go back and say, \u2018don\u2019t worry about it, you\u2019re 17\u2019. And how can you be an all-knowing, wise, visionary lyricist at 17? \u201cDo what you can do, have a ball; you\u2019re going to have the next 40 years to work out what you want to say to the world. Just enjoy the ride.\u201d \u2022 What Girls Are Made Of is playing at The Famous Spiegeltent from October 3rd to 13th as part of the Melbourne International Arts Festival. Tickets are on sale now.",

I didn\u2019t like the feeling, but then, it\u2019s a really nice outcome and nice feeling. I\u2019m very excited about that, that I have something on the side that helps me to cope with the tennis life.\u201d Naomi Osaka, the top seed and defending champion, moved on without the visible nerves of her first-round match, recovering from a break down in the second set to defeat Magda Linette 6-2, 6-4. Watching the new star of women\u2019s tennis from the players\u2019 box were her fellow Nike endorsees, Kobe Bryant and Colin Kaepernick. Later, the US qualifier Taylor Townsend created one of the big upsets of the tournament so far, beating the Wimbledon champion and fourth seed Simona Halep 2-6, 6-3, 7-6(4).",

The deal marks the beginning of the end of a complicated legal battle between homeowners, the building\u2019s developer and a neighboring construction project over the 58-storey structure, which has sunk and tilted 18 inches toward the north-west since it was built in 2008, drawing comparisons to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. \u201cThis litigation exposed a lot of problems in the development of this particular building,\u201d said Niall McCarthy, an attorney representing a group of homeowners. \u201cIt will be a roadmap for other downtown developments for what to avoid. This is a one of a kind situation we won\u2019t ever see again in San Francisco.\u201d Details of the settlement remained under wraps as they were reached during confidential mediation, but it would require Millennium Partners and Transbay Joint Powers Authority (TJPA) to pay for the $100m plan to fix the building. The settlement would also require the defendants pay every homeowner in the building for their estimated losses caused by the notoriety, McCarthy said, but it is unknown how much each resident will receive. \u201cEven with the fix, there\u2019s still going to be some stigma to the property,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see tour buses go down Mission Street that stop and point out Millennium Tower. At some point, when these people try and resell their units, the stigma from the sink and tilt will reduce the value of what it should be.\u201d The Millennium Tower was among San Francisco\u2019s first wave of new high-rises, opening in 2009 after finishing construction the year before. All 420 units eventually all sold, for a total of $750m. Prior to the publicity around the building\u2019s tilt, a three-bedroom unit was listed for nearly $9m. Owners of 163 units have applied for property tax adjustments, claiming a an aggregate reduction in value of those 163 condos from $374m to $153m, according to city records. From the beginning, Mission Street Development, which owns Millennium Partners, put the onus for the sinking on TJPA and the $2.2bn transit terminal the agency built next door to the Millennium. The agreement \u201cwill also set the framework for a final settlement and release of all claims related to the condition of the Millennium Tower, including the homeowners\u2019 claims related to impacts on the building from construction of the Transbay Transit Center and Salesforce Tower\u201d, the spokesman PJ Johnston said in a statement. \u201cMission Street Development has made clear from the beginning that its top priority has been to address and resolve the conditions that caused the building\u2019s past problems,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThe agreement announced today is consistent with that priority and assures that the building will continue to set the standard for urban living in San Francisco.\u201d The Transbay Joint Powers Authority \u201chas denied and continues to deny allegations that construction of the Transit Center caused any excessive movement or tilt experienced by the Millennium Tower\u201d, the agency said in a statement. The plan to fix the Millennium Tower is called the perimeter pile upgrade and would require drilling to the bedrock to reinforce the structure. The headline of this article was amended on 30 August 2019 to correct that a settlement was reached, not a court order to compensate residents.",

The La Liga side topped the group and proceeded to win the tournament; the French champions finished behind them and reached the last eight. This time around the creaking giants may feel thankful that they avoided any of the banana skins available in the lower pots.</p> <p>Now that Real Madrid and Gareth Bale are playing happy families, the Wales forward\u2019s experience at this level may yet help give them the edge; they will need him because Eden Hazard is not yet fit and there are already some doubts about the new striker from Eintracht Frankfurt, Luka Jovic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/champions-league-group-stage-draw-liverpool-napoli-tottenham-bayern-munich\">Champions League draw: Liverpool drawn with Napoli, Spurs face Bayern</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that Paris Saint-Germain, scarred by three round of 16 exits, necessarily take the upper hand. Neymar may be long gone when the group stage begins but, for all the forward\u2019s baggage, his departure would cut a gigantic hole in Thomas Tuchel\u2019s attacking resources. The manager will surely not survive another flat campaign in Europe.</p> <p>Club Brugge, who have signed Simon Mignolet and are courting Victor Wanyama, will feel they can pip Galatasaray to third position.</p> <p><strong>Group A: Prediction 1 Real Madrid; 2 PSG; 3 Club Brugge; 4 Galatasaray</strong></p> <p><strong>Star player Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 </strong>(PSG)</p> <p>It would take a calamity or two for Tottenham to be forced into a repeat of last season\u2019s salvage operation although, on current form, they will take nothing for granted. A much-changed Bayern side \u2013 Rib\u00e9ry, Robben, Rodr\u00edguez, Hummels out; Coutinho, Perisic, Pavard and Hern\u00e1ndez in \u2013 should be re-energised and can still rely on Robert Lewandowski, who scored his latest hat-trick against Schalke at the weekend. Should Spurs lose Christian Eriksen, they may lose the X factor that puts them in control.</p> <p>They will remember, too, that Red Star Belgrade defeated Liverpool last year. The Serbian champions fancy a shot at third place and will contest perhaps group stage\u2019s most romantic clash when they face Bayern, who they defeated en route to winning the 1990-91 European Cup in one of the competition\u2019s great contests. It will be Spurs\u2019 first trip to the Marakana since a Uefa Cup tie in 1972.</p> <p>Olympiakos beat an impressive Krasnodar side in the play-offs this week and have passed through the group stage four times before. But, while the veteran winger Mathieu Valbuena is a new addition to their squad, it is hard to see them or Red Star toppling the front runners.</p> <p><strong>Group B: Prediction 1 Bayern Munich; 2 Spurs; 3 Olympiakos; 4 Red Star Belgrade</strong></p> <p><strong>Star player Philippe Coutinho </strong>(Bayern)</p> <p>Manchester City may yet receive a Champions League ban in the coming months but their participation this season has scant chance of finishing early. For the third consecutive season they will face Shakhtar Donetsk and, having won their meetings in 2018-19 by an aggregate of 9-0, will see little cause for concern. Shakhtar have not lost a domestic league match for over a year but their outstanding manager, Paulo Fonseca, left for Roma this summer and it is hard to see Luis Castro coaxing a dramatic improvement.</p> <p>Dinamo Zagreb beat Arsenal in their most recent group stage appearance four years ago but lost their other five games; a battle for third looks their best bet this time but the famed Maksimir Stadium atmosphere may not compensate for a lack of top-level quality.</p> <p>The group\u2019s most interesting side is Atalanta, who will probably be the nearest approximation to a challenger for City. Their Champions League debut was well-earned and, under Gian Piero Gasperini, they played some of Europe\u2019s most vibrant football last season. Martin Skrtel has been brought in from Fenerbahce to add a layer of steel.</p> <p><strong>Group C: Prediction 1 Man City; 2 Atalanta; 3 Shakhtar; 4 Dinamo Zagreb</strong></p> <p><strong>Star player Raheem Sterling </strong>(Man C)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a3936c2d6836fc035c60e32b55763ebf5d034f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a3936c2d6836fc035c60e32b55763ebf5d034f7/0_26_2555_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raheem Sterling will be looking to make an impact on the Champions League.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raheem Sterling will be looking to make an impact on the Champions League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Atl\u00e9tico certainly have a score to settle against Juventus, who overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit to defeat them in last season\u2019s round of 16. That was entirely owing to a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick; Juventus got no further and the forward, who turns 35 this season, knows his chances of adding to his five titles are running out.</p> <p>Ronaldo will be as important as ever to Juve, for whom a slightly curious summer\u2019s business has seen Aaron Ramsey and Adrien Rabiot arrive on free transfers and Matthijs de Ligt make his high-profile move from Ajax. Gianluigi Buffon is also back for one last crack but they may still have to rely on Gonzalo Higua\u00edn while there are suggestions Paulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic could yet leave. Atl\u00e9tico, for all the bad bood of Antoine Griezmann\u2019s departure, have started their season with successive 1-0 wins and can luxuriate in the \u20ac126m presence of Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix \u2013 not to mention England\u2019s Kieran Trippier.</p> <p>Bayer Leverkusen will be weakened by Julian Brandt\u2019s departure for Borussia Dortmund; Lokomotiv Moscow will surely offer little more than an awkward away trip or two.</p> <p><strong>Group D: Prediction 1 Juventus; 2 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid; 3 Bayer L; 4 L Moscow</strong></p> <p><strong>Star player Cristiano Ronaldo </strong>(Juventus)</p> <p>This lineup does Liverpool\u2019s prospects of defending their title little harm. They traded wins with Napoli last season but it is hard to make a case that Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team is dramatically stronger this time, although the Mexico forward Hirving Lozano is an exciting acquisition from PSV Eindhoven and Kostas Manolas brings defensive quality \u2013 and a taste for drama, as he showed against Barcelona two seasons ago \u2013 from Roma.</p> <p>Red Bull Salzburg arrive in the group stage after a succession of near-misses and a lively young team will cause problems even though their successful manager, Marco Rose, left for Borussia Monchengladbach in pre-season. Sadio Man\u00e9 and Naby Ke\u00efta will, if the latter is fit, be able to face the side they both represented earlier in the decade. Salzburg have a fine record of developing African players and the 19-year-old Mali forward, Sekou Koita, may be the latest off the production line.</p> <p>Perhaps Salzburg will be able to trouble Napoli in the hunt for a last-16 place. Genk, in their first appearance since 2011-12, look unlikely to do that on the evidence of last season\u2019s Europa League.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cdb9e15a86aa50039bc63e8aef06e8efa8a9739\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cdb9e15a86aa50039bc63e8aef06e8efa8a9739/0_152_3380_2027/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naby Keita should face his former club.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naby Keita should face his former club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Group E: Prediction 1 Liverpool; 2 Napoli; 3 RB Salzburg; 4 Genk</strong></p> <p><strong>Star player Mohamed Salah </strong>(Liverpool)</p> <p>Will the alarm bells be ringing for Barcelona? Slavia Prague\u2019s presence does not quite make this a \u201cgroup of death\u201d but the inclusion of Inter Milan, now managed by Antonio Conte, provides a curveball that will make the five-time winners sweat. Inter mean business, as the arrivals of Romelu Lukaku and Diego God\u00edn have shown; Alexis S\u00e1nchez has followed and the Serie A side, who last reached the knockout stage in 2011-12, look a different beast to the one they met in Group B last season.</p> <p>Back then, Inter held Bar\u00e7a to a draw at San Siro but fluffed their lines against Spurs and PSV Eindhoven, missing a glorious chance to get through. This time they will look to capitalise on Lionel Messi\u2019s absence with a calf problem, as well as any teething problems Neymar experiences if his return goes through. Antoine Griezmann is, at least, now off the mark for Ernesto Valverde\u2019s reshaped side while Frenkie de Jong will only get better.</p> <p>Meanwhile Borussia Dortmund, who have purred through the Bundesliga\u2019s opening fortnight, look stronger than last year and will be better for the return of Mats Hummels. If everyone clicks, this group could provide the best drama.</p> <p><strong>Group F: Prediction 1 Borussia Dortmund; 2 Barcelona; 3 Inter; 4 Slavia Prague</strong></p> <p><strong>Star player Antoine Griezmann </strong>(Barca)</p> <p>There is little stardust here but is certainly the most evenly-matched group. Zenit and Benfica may have felt smug about drawing one another but will face arguably the strongest teams from the other two pots, with every chance the order could be turned on its head.</p> <p>RB Leipzig, who finished third in a similarly tight quartet two seasons ago, look well set to improve on that this time. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s reign has begun with consecutive impressive wins in the Bundesliga, while they have retained key players and added the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Christopher Nkunku. Timo Werner is a lethal striker and their creative hub, Emil Forsberg, cannot currently get into a starting XI that is firing on all cylinders.</p> <p>Last season Lyon shocked Manchester City but, with Sylvinho in charge and the likes of Tanguy Ndombele, Nabil Fekir and Ferland Mendy having departed, their appearance has changed somewhat. They have a goalscorer in Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and should have too much for Benfica, who are now shorn of the brilliant youngster Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix. If, as expected, Zenit fall short them Russia\u2019s top-seed status will be in serious jeopardy.</p> <p><strong>Group G: Prediction 1 RB Leipzig; 2 Lyon; 3 Benfica; 4 Zenit St Petersburg</strong></p> <p><strong>Star player Timo Werner </strong>(RB Leipzig)</p> <p>Chelsea, bereft of Eden Hazard and David Luiz, might have hoped for a softer hand from the lower pots but will be happy enough to have avoided any of the heavyweights.

      "bodyText": "Four years ago, two better iterations of Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain slugged it out at this stage. The La Liga side topped the group and proceeded to win the tournament; the French champions finished behind them and reached the last eight. This time around the creaking giants may feel thankful that they avoided any of the banana skins available in the lower pots. Now that Real Madrid and Gareth Bale are playing happy families, the Wales forward\u2019s experience at this level may yet help give them the edge; they will need him because Eden Hazard is not yet fit and there are already some doubts about the new striker from Eintracht Frankfurt, Luka Jovic. Not that Paris Saint-Germain, scarred by three round of 16 exits, necessarily take the upper hand. Neymar may be long gone when the group stage begins but, for all the forward\u2019s baggage, his departure would cut a gigantic hole in Thomas Tuchel\u2019s attacking resources. The manager will surely not survive another flat campaign in Europe. Club Brugge, who have signed Simon Mignolet and are courting Victor Wanyama, will feel they can pip Galatasaray to third position. Group A: Prediction 1 Real Madrid; 2 PSG; 3 Club Brugge; 4 Galatasaray Star player Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (PSG) It would take a calamity or two for Tottenham to be forced into a repeat of last season\u2019s salvage operation although, on current form, they will take nothing for granted. A much-changed Bayern side \u2013 Rib\u00e9ry, Robben, Rodr\u00edguez, Hummels out; Coutinho, Perisic, Pavard and Hern\u00e1ndez in \u2013 should be re-energised and can still rely on Robert Lewandowski, who scored his latest hat-trick against Schalke at the weekend. Should Spurs lose Christian Eriksen, they may lose the X factor that puts them in control. They will remember, too, that Red Star Belgrade defeated Liverpool last year. The Serbian champions fancy a shot at third place and will contest perhaps group stage\u2019s most romantic clash when they face Bayern, who they defeated en route to winning the 1990-91 European Cup in one of the competition\u2019s great contests. It will be Spurs\u2019 first trip to the Marakana since a Uefa Cup tie in 1972. Olympiakos beat an impressive Krasnodar side in the play-offs this week and have passed through the group stage four times before. But, while the veteran winger Mathieu Valbuena is a new addition to their squad, it is hard to see them or Red Star toppling the front runners. Group B: Prediction 1 Bayern Munich; 2 Spurs; 3 Olympiakos; 4 Red Star Belgrade Star player Philippe Coutinho (Bayern) Manchester City may yet receive a Champions League ban in the coming months but their participation this season has scant chance of finishing early. For the third consecutive season they will face Shakhtar Donetsk and, having won their meetings in 2018-19 by an aggregate of 9-0, will see little cause for concern. Shakhtar have not lost a domestic league match for over a year but their outstanding manager, Paulo Fonseca, left for Roma this summer and it is hard to see Luis Castro coaxing a dramatic improvement. Dinamo Zagreb beat Arsenal in their most recent group stage appearance four years ago but lost their other five games; a battle for third looks their best bet this time but the famed Maksimir Stadium atmosphere may not compensate for a lack of top-level quality. The group\u2019s most interesting side is Atalanta, who will probably be the nearest approximation to a challenger for City. Their Champions League debut was well-earned and, under Gian Piero Gasperini, they played some of Europe\u2019s most vibrant football last season. Martin Skrtel has been brought in from Fenerbahce to add a layer of steel. Group C: Prediction 1 Man City; 2 Atalanta; 3 Shakhtar; 4 Dinamo Zagreb Star player Raheem Sterling (Man C) Atl\u00e9tico certainly have a score to settle against Juventus, who overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit to defeat them in last season\u2019s round of 16. That was entirely owing to a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick; Juventus got no further and the forward, who turns 35 this season, knows his chances of adding to his five titles are running out. Ronaldo will be as important as ever to Juve, for whom a slightly curious summer\u2019s business has seen Aaron Ramsey and Adrien Rabiot arrive on free transfers and Matthijs de Ligt make his high-profile move from Ajax. Gianluigi Buffon is also back for one last crack but they may still have to rely on Gonzalo Higua\u00edn while there are suggestions Paulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic could yet leave. Atl\u00e9tico, for all the bad bood of Antoine Griezmann\u2019s departure, have started their season with successive 1-0 wins and can luxuriate in the \u20ac126m presence of Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix \u2013 not to mention England\u2019s Kieran Trippier. Bayer Leverkusen will be weakened by Julian Brandt\u2019s departure for Borussia Dortmund; Lokomotiv Moscow will surely offer little more than an awkward away trip or two. Group D: Prediction 1 Juventus; 2 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid; 3 Bayer L; 4 L Moscow Star player Cristiano Ronaldo (Juventus) This lineup does Liverpool\u2019s prospects of defending their title little harm. They traded wins with Napoli last season but it is hard to make a case that Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team is dramatically stronger this time, although the Mexico forward Hirving Lozano is an exciting acquisition from PSV Eindhoven and Kostas Manolas brings defensive quality \u2013 and a taste for drama, as he showed against Barcelona two seasons ago \u2013 from Roma. Red Bull Salzburg arrive in the group stage after a succession of near-misses and a lively young team will cause problems even though their successful manager, Marco Rose, left for Borussia Monchengladbach in pre-season. Sadio Man\u00e9 and Naby Ke\u00efta will, if the latter is fit, be able to face the side they both represented earlier in the decade. Salzburg have a fine record of developing African players and the 19-year-old Mali forward, Sekou Koita, may be the latest off the production line. Perhaps Salzburg will be able to trouble Napoli in the hunt for a last-16 place. Genk, in their first appearance since 2011-12, look unlikely to do that on the evidence of last season\u2019s Europa League. Group E: Prediction 1 Liverpool; 2 Napoli; 3 RB Salzburg; 4 Genk Star player Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) Will the alarm bells be ringing for Barcelona? Slavia Prague\u2019s presence does not quite make this a \u201cgroup of death\u201d but the inclusion of Inter Milan, now managed by Antonio Conte, provides a curveball that will make the five-time winners sweat. Inter mean business, as the arrivals of Romelu Lukaku and Diego God\u00edn have shown; Alexis S\u00e1nchez has followed and the Serie A side, who last reached the knockout stage in 2011-12, look a different beast to the one they met in Group B last season. Back then, Inter held Bar\u00e7a to a draw at San Siro but fluffed their lines against Spurs and PSV Eindhoven, missing a glorious chance to get through. This time they will look to capitalise on Lionel Messi\u2019s absence with a calf problem, as well as any teething problems Neymar experiences if his return goes through. Antoine Griezmann is, at least, now off the mark for Ernesto Valverde\u2019s reshaped side while Frenkie de Jong will only get better. Meanwhile Borussia Dortmund, who have purred through the Bundesliga\u2019s opening fortnight, look stronger than last year and will be better for the return of Mats Hummels. If everyone clicks, this group could provide the best drama. Group F: Prediction 1 Borussia Dortmund; 2 Barcelona; 3 Inter; 4 Slavia Prague Star player Antoine Griezmann (Barca) There is little stardust here but is certainly the most evenly-matched group. Zenit and Benfica may have felt smug about drawing one another but will face arguably the strongest teams from the other two pots, with every chance the order could be turned on its head. RB Leipzig, who finished third in a similarly tight quartet two seasons ago, look well set to improve on that this time. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s reign has begun with consecutive impressive wins in the Bundesliga, while they have retained key players and added the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Christopher Nkunku. Timo Werner is a lethal striker and their creative hub, Emil Forsberg, cannot currently get into a starting XI that is firing on all cylinders. Last season Lyon shocked Manchester City but, with Sylvinho in charge and the likes of Tanguy Ndombele, Nabil Fekir and Ferland Mendy having departed, their appearance has changed somewhat. They have a goalscorer in Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and should have too much for Benfica, who are now shorn of the brilliant youngster Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix. If, as expected, Zenit fall short them Russia\u2019s top-seed status will be in serious jeopardy. Group G: Prediction 1 RB Leipzig; 2 Lyon; 3 Benfica; 4 Zenit St Petersburg Star player Timo Werner (RB Leipzig) Chelsea, bereft of Eden Hazard and David Luiz, might have hoped for a softer hand from the lower pots but will be happy enough to have avoided any of the heavyweights. Whether that statement does a disservice to Ajax depends on how quickly last season\u2019s darlings recover from losing Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt; their principles will not change but they toiled at times during their play-off win over Apoel Nicosia and a repeat of their run to the last four may be a long shot. Frank Lampard may also be encouraged by the way Valencia, to whom Chelsea have never lost in six Champions League meetings, fell short in last season\u2019s Europa League semi-final against Arsenal. Maxi G\u00f3mez should offer the Spanish side more cutting edge, though, while the goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen is a handy arrival from Barcelona who will enjoy a reunion with Ajax. Valencia are, in fact, the only member of this group not to have lost key outfield players over the summer. Lille sold Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 to Arsenal, with Rafael Le\u00e3o and Thiago Mendes also leaving the Ligue 1 runners-up, but the Nigerian forward Victor Osimhen has made a flying start and will need attention.

      "bodyText": "Alfredo Morelos sparked jubilant scenes at Ibrox as his injury-time winner against Legia Warsaw sent Rangers into the Europa League group stage. Eyes and ears were on the Govan stands as much as the action on the pitch after Uefa issued Rangers with a double rap for sectarian singing. But the biggest roar of the night was reserved for Morelos as he sealed a last-gasp 1-0 win which sees Steven Gerrard\u2019s team repeat their feat of making it all the way through four rounds to qualify. And Legia will likely now find themselves in trouble with European football\u2019s governing body after the travelling Polish support set off a spectacular pyrotechnic display that temporarily halted the game with the field shrouded in a thick blanket of smoke. Rangers were forced to close off 3,000 seats as a result of the sectarian chants that marred their opening qualifier with St Joseph\u2019s, while the threat of a more severe punishment - including a full stadium closure - is yet to be decided after more chants were aired in Warsaw last week. The Legia fans did their best to spark a response from the home support as they unfurled a banner apparently depicting the late Pope John Paul II, himself a Pole. But the home faithful kept the songbook clean as they responded to Gerrard\u2019s call to pump up the noise. Earlier the Scottish champions, Celtic, enjoyed a comfortable second leg, beating AIK 4-1 in Sweden to go through 6-1 on aggregate.

Downing Street is gearing up to resist efforts by MPs, lawyers and campaigners to frustrate his suspension of parliament. Johnson\u2019s team face a battle on several fronts, with the Scottish court of session due to rule on Friday on whether proroguing parliament is unconstitutional and MPs drawing up plans to legislate against a no deal. Downing Street believes it can defeat the legal challenge, if necessary in the supreme court, and it will use every parliamentary tactic available to frustrate the rebel MPs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear before that we will deliver Brexit by any means necessary and that remains the case,\u201d said one Downing Street source. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for a cross-party group of 75 MPs and peers, told the Scottish court of session in Edinburgh that Johnson had trampled on more than 400 years of constitutional law by asking the Queen to prorogue parliament solely for political gain. \u201cWe have a constitution ruled by law,\u201d O\u2019Neill told Lord Doherty, urging him to issue an interdict \u2013 a Scottish court order equivalent to an injunction \u2013 forcing the UK government to quash the prorogation order signed by the Queen on Wednesday. Whitehall sources said the government was \u201cpretty confident of our case\u201d and would pursue it to the supreme court \u201cif for some reason the judgment went the other way\u201d. Johnson\u2019s ruthless approach was underlined on Thursday evening when the chancellor\u2019s media adviser was abruptly sacked. It is understood the special adviser, who had previously worked for Sajid Javid\u2019s predecessor as chancellor, Philip Hammond, was dismissed on the spot by the prime minister\u2019s aide, Dominic Cummings, and escorted out of Downing Street. The dismissal followed the last-minute cancellation of a speech planned for Wednesday by Javid and comes a few days ahead of a critical spending review. However, cracks appeared on Thursday in the government\u2019s careful public justification for the suspension of parliament when the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was caught on mic at a meeting in Helsinki on Thursday. Wallace, a longtime ally of Johnson, said: \u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want. It has been awful at saying what it wants. That\u2019s the reality. So eventually any leader has to, you know, try.\u201d He continued: \u201cOur system is a winner-takes-all system. If you win a parliamentary majority, you control everything, you control the timetable. There\u2019s no written separation, so \u2026 you pretty much are in command of the whole thing. And we\u2019ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority and a coalition and that\u2019s not easy for our system.\u201d Downing Street later said Wallace \u201cmisspoke\u201d. Ministers privately admit the battle to block anti-no-deal legislation in the Commons next week appears all but lost, but efforts to frustrate the rebels is focusing on the House of Lords. Opposition peers expect Tory peers to attempt to filibuster the legislation, which will need to have passed through all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent before parliament is suspended or it will fall. Johnson has already suffered one setback in the Lords as George Young quit the Tory frontbench in the upper house on Thursday in protest at the decision to suspend parliament. In his resignation letter, Lord Young, who was a minister under Margaret Thatcher, said he was \u201cvery unhappy at the timing and length of the prorogation, and its motivation\u201d. He said he was not part of any \u201cremainer plot\u201d. It is unclear how Johnson would respond if an anti-no-deal bill is passed mandating him to extend article 50, but it is widely believed at Westminster that No 10 is working on plans for a general election to be held after 31 October if possible but beforehand if necessary. Cabinet ministers who have previously been outspoken in their opposition to prorogation, including Amber Rudd and Matt Hancock, have been kept onboard by the hope Johnson can strike a reworked Brexit deal. They believe the real prospect of a no-deal Brexit will strengthen his hand in the negotiations and then persuade sceptical Labour MPs to support a deal rather than risk crashing out on 31 October. According to a diplomatic note of Frost\u2019s meeting in Brussels, seen by the Guardian, Frost downplayed Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament, describing it as normal.

Those voters didn\u2019t vote for a Trump-Johnson no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, nor to have an even more vicious free-market version of the establishment imposed on them without election. So the Johnson regime is doubly isolated, both from its natural base in the political establishment and from the popular base that it\u2019s trying to misrepresent among ordinary people.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ripple effects of George Pell\u2019s trials have spread beyond survivors to anyone who identifies themselves as Catholic</strong> \u2013 more than 5 million people in Australia.

Every minute, the equivalent of a football field and a half of the so-called lungs of the Earth is incinerated. The rainforest isn\u2019t just totemic, we know that the future stability of the climate rests on preserving it. To be an onlooker to this burning triggers the type of overwhelming anxiety that probably won\u2019t be soothed by wearing a \u201csave the rainforest\u201d T-shirt like we did in the 1980s. In fact, that\u2019s the last thing we should be doing, because the Amazon burn is very much a fashion crisis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/29/burning-issue-how-fashions-love-of-leather-is-fuelling-the-fires-in-the-amazon\">writes Lucy Siegle</a>. Beef and soya aren\u2019t the sole culprits for the chaos; the west\u2019s insatiable demand for shoes, belts and handbags is also driving rainforest destruction.</p> <p>This has been evident for a decade. In 2009 Greenpeace published Slaughtering the Amazon, a report that should have changed everything \u2013 and nearly did. The report concluded that the demand for leather was fuelling the destruction of the Amazon in its own right, not just accidentally as a byproduct of beef. This week the fashion industry made a move, as LVMH, the world\u2019s top luxury goods firm, pledged \u20ac10m to fight the Amazon burn, adding to the $20m pledged by the G7.

Israel has positioned mannequins of soldiers in jeeps along the Lebanon border, according to Lebanese and Israeli correspondents, as the army braces itself for an expected attack from Hezbollah. Opinion and analysis Comparisons between Boris Johnson and Charles I aren\u2019t just lazy rhetoric, writes John Rees. Johnson may not be the absolutist king but he is isolated and autocratic \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen that before. \u201cBut that\u2019s only the beginning of the story of the isolation of the Boris monarchy. The Tory Brexiteers don\u2019t even rightly represent most people who voted Brexit. Those voters didn\u2019t vote for a Trump-Johnson no-deal Brexit, nor to have an even more vicious free-market version of the establishment imposed on them without election. So the Johnson regime is doubly isolated, both from its natural base in the political establishment and from the popular base that it\u2019s trying to misrepresent among ordinary people.\u201d Ripple effects of George Pell\u2019s trials have spread beyond survivors to anyone who identifies themselves as Catholic \u2013 more than 5 million people in Australia. A nation is now confronted to reckon with the sins of the church, writes Brigid Delaney: \u201cFor those like me, who were already drifting away from religion, the last years of the church\u2019s trials have turned ambivalence into anger and disgust but also something more complicated. Leaving your religion can leave you with a void, particularly if you grew up marinating in the church\u2019s beliefs and rituals.\u201d Sport Fans in Derby wanting to see Steve Smith had to content themselves with autographs at stumps on the first day of Australia\u2019s tour match, with the opening batsmen, Usman Khawaja and Marcus Harris, compiling 77 unbeaten runs after Derbyshire were bowled out for 172. As Australia ponder who will make way for the returning Smith in next week\u2019s fourth Test, England have selection puzzles of their own. Super Netball\u2019s bonus point system may have added interest and excitement but it is down to good fortune that it has not yet cost a deserving team, as the league heads into the finals series. Thinking time: How fashion\u2019s love of leather is fuelling the fires in the Amazon The level of destruction is almost impossible to fathom. About 41,000 fires have been recorded by scientists in the Brazilian Amazon since January, with more than half of those in the past three weeks \u2013 hence the apocalyptic headlines. Every minute, the equivalent of a football field and a half of the so-called lungs of the Earth is incinerated. The rainforest isn\u2019t just totemic, we know that the future stability of the climate rests on preserving it. To be an onlooker to this burning triggers the type of overwhelming anxiety that probably won\u2019t be soothed by wearing a \u201csave the rainforest\u201d T-shirt like we did in the 1980s. In fact, that\u2019s the last thing we should be doing, because the Amazon burn is very much a fashion crisis, writes Lucy Siegle. Beef and soya aren\u2019t the sole culprits for the chaos; the west\u2019s insatiable demand for shoes, belts and handbags is also driving rainforest destruction. This has been evident for a decade. In 2009 Greenpeace published Slaughtering the Amazon, a report that should have changed everything \u2013 and nearly did. The report concluded that the demand for leather was fuelling the destruction of the Amazon in its own right, not just accidentally as a byproduct of beef. This week the fashion industry made a move, as LVMH, the world\u2019s top luxury goods firm, pledged \u20ac10m to fight the Amazon burn, adding to the $20m pledged by the G7. But could it be too little too late? Media roundup The security firm Paladin was fined more than 1,000 times by the home affairs department, the Financial Review reports, even though officials insisted they were happy with the company\u2019s $500m refugee services contract and work on Manus Island. David Jones will \u201caggressively close stores\u201d, the Age reports, as its profits slump amid lukewarm consumer spending. And the ABC investigates whether edible insects could be Australia\u2019s next export success story. Coming up Scott Morrison is visiting Timor-Leste for the 20th anniversary of its independence vote. A Senate inquiry into whether Julie Bishop and Christopher Pyne breached ministerial standards will hear from the outgoing head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with the brilliant Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from Molineux. Bye! Yes, Rangers are through. It looks like Rangers will join Celtic, Wolves and others in tomorrow\u2019s Europa League draw. Alfredo Morelos\u2019s injury-time goal has put them 1-0 up on aggregate against Legia Warsaw. Peep peep! Wolves are into the group stage of the Europa League! Torino finished strongly, but for the most part Wolves were comfortable in defence and dangerous on the counter-attack. They have deservedly eliminated a decent Italian side, and they and their supporters will add a lot to this competition. 90+2 min Another Wolves change: Neto on, Raul Jimenez off. He is pure gold, Jimenez, and the Wolves fans give him a lovely ovation as he leaves the field. 90 min Ruben Neves replaces Joao Moutinho. There will be four minutes of additional time. 90 min Another chance for Torino! After an almighty scramble on the edge of the area, Belotti turns beautifully away from Coady but has to stretch to take the shot and can only slice it wide. 88 min Millico scurries into the area before mishitting a low shot that is blocked by the sliding Coady. Torino are going down swinging. 86 min A great chance at the other end, with the substitute Meite running onto Belotti\u2019s neat flick and slapping a shot this far wide from 16 yards. 86 min Sirigu makes an outstanding save, plunging to his right to palm away a low shot from Dendoncker. He played a lovely one-two on the edge with Jimenez, moved the ball onto his left foot and drove the ball towards goal. Sirigu did extremely well to keep it out. 84 min Torino are running out of time. They need two goals in eight or nine minutes. 82 min Torino make their third change, with Zaza replaced by Vincenzo Millico. 81 min Wolves make a change, with Patrick Cutrone replacing Diogo Jota. 81 min Wolves are starting to look a litttle edgy, especially at set pieces. After a bit of a scramble in the area, Zaza flicks the ball up and slices an overhead kick over the bar. 79 min Simone Zaza moves onto his left foot and hammers an excellent 25-yard shot that takes a slight deflection and flashes just past the post. I think Rui Patricio had it covered. 77 min The Wolves players and fans enjoy a long period of ol\u00e9 football. There\u2019s a party atmosphere, even though Torino only need two goals to force extra-time. 74 min For the umpteenth time tonight, a scintillating run from Traore leads to a corner for Wolves. Moutinho\u2019s outswinger is headed down by Boly and bounces around the box before being cleared. 73 min Diogo Jota seems fine. He\u2019s been Wolves\u2019 best player, just ahead of Traore and Coady. 72 min Another Torino change: Tomas Rincon is replaced by Soualiho Meite. 71 min Diogo Jota is receiving treatment after being taken out off the ball by Rincon. He\u2019s lucky not to be booked for that. 70 min Torino make their first change: Temitayo Aina is replaced by Alex Berenguer. 66 min Aina\u2019s long throw bounces across the Wolves area and is headed clear by Jonny. Most of Torino\u2019s best moments have been from dead balls, including the goal. 62 min Bremer is booked for hoofing the superb Diogo Jota. Torino haven\u2019t been able to handle him. 59 min The Wolves goal doesn\u2019t change the fact Torino need to score three. But it means that, if it ends 3-2, the match will go extra-time. Had Torino won 3-1 they would have gone through. Wolves take the lead almost straight from the kick-off! Diogo Jota wriggled through and smashed a low shot that was beaten away by Sirigu. It rebounded to Dendoncker, who sidefooted the loose ball in off the post from 15 yards. And it leads to a goal! Baselli flashed the free-kick towards the near post, where Belotti steered a good header past Rui Patricio from six yards. 57 min Belotti is fouled just outside the area, a fair way to the left of centre. Baselli will take the free-kick... 55 min Traore skins Aina again and wins a corner. 53 min Torino continue to dominate possession, but it\u2019s a classic example of sterile domination. Wolves have been the better team, whatever the possession statistics may say. 51 min Good save from Rui Patricio. Torino had a free-kick on the left wing, which Baselli curled towards the far top corner. Rui Patricio leapt to his left to fingertip it behind. 48 min Lukic is booked for a cynical foul on Diogo Jota, who had surged past a couple of Torino players near the halfway line. 46 min Peep peep! Wolves begin the second half. \u201cIt\u2019s worth staying up for the highlights of FC Antwerp - AZ Alkmaar,\u201d says Maarten Logghe. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to enjoy Antwerp going down to 10 men after 35 minutes because of two stupid yellows in three minutes. They managed to hang on and even score with 15 minutes remaining, Only to see their goalscorer already on a yellow, take off his shirt and climb the fence to celebrate with fans. So they\u2019re down to nine.\u201d And it all goes wrong, big-time. \u201cThey\u2019re not showing this game in the U.S. so I\u2019m unable to watch it,\u201d says J.R. in Illinois, \u201cbut that\u2019s okay because it has given me the afternoon to ponder Eric Cantona\u2019s speech at the Champions League draw earlier today.\u201d It was so good. He could not give a solitary sardine about all that ceremonial nonsense. Typical Wolves. They\u2019ve had less of the ball, more of the chances and deservedly lead through Raul Jimenez\u2019s smart finish. Unless they concede at least three goals in the second half, they will be in tomorrow\u2019s Europa League draw. 45 min Jonny is booked for offending the referee\u2019s sensibilities. 44 min Coady, under a lot of pressure from Zaza, does really well to head away a superb cross from De Silvestri. Wolves are so well organised defensively. 41 min The match is getting a little physical. Torino are starting to look hacked off with life, Rincon in particular. 37 min: A chance for Zaza! It came from a fine right-wing cross by De Silvestri. Zaza towered over Coady, eight yards from goal, but planted his header too close to Rui Patricio, who plunged to his left to make a comfortable save. 35 min For all Torino\u2019s possession, Wolves have been very comfortable defensively and have created the clearer chances on the break. 33 min Baselli is booked for flattening Traore. 33 min \u201cTraore was memorably described last season as a \u2018Porsche with a learner driver at the wheel\u2019,\u201d says Pete. \u201cBut tonight he looks like a Lamborghini with Lewis Hamilton in the driver\u2019s seat!\u201d 32 min Torino need three goals or they will be parachuted into the Do One Cup. It was made by the excellent Traore, who ran Aina, came back onto his left foot and curled a low a cross towards the near post. Jimenez got between Bonifazi and Bremer to sweep a deft volley past Sirigu from six yards. Raul Jimenez gets his sixth goal in this season\u2019s Europa League. It\u2019s bloody August. 28 min A corner is cleared to Baselli, 30 yards from goal. He knows he shouldn\u2019t shoot, deep down he knows it\u2019s a bad idea, but he can\u2019t resist. Goalkick to Wolves. 26 min After a slow start, Wolves are starting to look really dangerous on the counter-attack. Jota and Dendoncker combine to find Jonny, whose lofted cross is headed away. Moments later, the crowd appeal for handball after a ricochet in the Torino area. I don\u2019t think there was anything in it. 25 min That was an awesome turn of speed from Traore. He didn\u2019t need to do anything fancy, just roar past anyone who was in his way. 24 min: What a run from Traore! After some neat one-touch play around the halfway line, Traore surged exhilaratingly through the inside-right channel. He scorched past the last man Bremer and into the area before whacking a low shot that was excellently saved by Sirigu. 23 min Saiss plays a terrible pass from inside his own area that goes straight to Lukic on the left wing. He is saved by Coady, who stoops to head the resulting cross away. 21 min See 18 min. 19 min A defensive header from Vallejo (I think) drops invitingly for Rincon, who hooks a volley wide of goal from 23 yards. 18 min It\u2019s still all Torino. They haven\u2019t created much, just a half chance from that Baselli free-kick, but it\u2019s been a confident start nonetheless. 17 min Random Torino memories, part 1. 16 min Lukic teases Vallejo on the left, moves the ball back onto his right foot ... and wafts a cross straight out of play for a goalkick. 13 min Torino are dominating possession. That won\u2019t particularly bother Wolves, who are happiest playing on the counter-attack, but things will get very nervy if Torino get the first goal. 12 min Jimenez is fouled 30 yards from goal, slightly to the right of centre. Saiss\u2019s free-kick hits the top of the wall and is eventually cleared. 11 min \u201cWolves are not in gold, they are in orange,\u201d says David Dein, throwing some shade my way. \u201cPropose to someone with a ring that colour and you\u2019re more likely to get a slap then a yes.\u201d If you ask me, I\u2019d say the jersey is more of a \u2018dark gold\u2019, and that the kit is the first featuring the club\u2019s new sponsor ManbetX, while CoinDeal remain sleeve sponsors for another campaign in the top tier of English football. 10 min Torino are starting to look dangerous. Baselli\u2019s dipping, inswinging free-kick from the left is headed on by De Silvestri and just evades the unmarked Belotti beyond the far post. 8 min \u201cNice to see Nuno putting faith in Jesus to break up the back three hegemony of Coady-Boly-Bennett,\u201d says Phil Russell. \u201cBennett defied all expectations in getting through last season without being too exposed but is the weakest link of the 3, especially when it comes to pace. Playing both yellow-card magnet Saiss and Dendoncker in midfield is more negative and I wonder if Nuno is looking to shield the defence with effectively a 1.5 goal cushion and try and hit on the break. Thought Gibbs-White or Neto would\u2019ve got a start. Might be a cagey first 45 that comes to life after the break.\u201d 7 min Torino try the old Beckham/Scholes corner. Baselli connects well with his volley but screws it well wide. 7 min Aina goes on a jaunty run infield before hitting a weak shot from 25 yards that takes a slight deflection and goes behind for a corner. 5 min \u201cSitting just a half a mile from Molineux and with a salmon sandwich in hand, I predict a 2-2 draw tonight and an aggregate win,\u201d says Pete. \u201cBut why is Neves on the bench again? Pop over for a Horlicks if you get cold.\u201d I\u2019m sure Neves would have started if you were behind in the tie. Nuno will have to take some risks with rotation this season, certainly if you reach the group stage. 4 min A clipped cross from Diogo Jota just evades Ji-MEN-ez at the near post, after which there\u2019s a break in play while Izzo receives treatment. He\u2019s unhappy with one of the Wolves players, Jonny I think. 3 min Nothing to report so far. 2 min \u201cMeanwhile, Celtic are winning in Sweden,\u201d says Alec McAulay. \u201cYou know, Celtic - from Glasgow; Glasgow, you know - in Scotland; Scotland, you know - near the Lake District.\u201d I do know; I live there. 1 min Peep peep! Torino, in their familiar burgundy kit, get the match underway. Wolves are in gold. \u201cCan I use your stage to get something off my chest?\u201d says Simon Frank. \u201cThe Wolves striker is called Raul Ji-MEN-ez, emphasis on the second syllable. Not JIM-enez. Ditto Martinez. Ditto every bloody Spanish name ending in \u2013ez. It\u2019s my mission to erase this mistake from every football podcast out there. Except Nessun Dorma - they\u2019d never make such a basic error.\u201d To be fair, we struggle to pronounce Steve Bull\u2019s name correctly. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Phil Grey. \u201cIt\u2019s actually 4,679,216,614,909,999,999,532 matches. You\u2019re forgetting the 1991 European Cup final between Red Star and Marseille.\u201d I paid a lot of money to Lacuna, Inc. to have that game erased from my memory.

Although she stressed the decision had been made for family reasons, in her resignation letter she acknowledged: \u201cI have not hidden the conflict I have felt over Brexit.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>An </strong><strong>attempt was made in a Scottish court to reverse the decision to suspend parliament</strong>. Lord Doherty, presiding over the hearing, said he would consider the issue overnight and give his ruling at 10am tomorrow.</li> \n   <li><strong>The defence secretary, </strong><strong>Ben Wallace, was caught on mic apparently admitting the real reason parliament was prorogued</strong>. Speaking to his French counterpart at a summit in Helsinki, Wallace could be heard explaining the decision. He said: \u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want.

That review cannot leave us short-changed again.</p> \n   <p>After nine years of austerity, our Welsh government budget is 5% lower in real terms than it was back in 2010.</p> \n   <p>We currently face the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, and in those circumstances, we know that the economy in Wales is likely to be around 10% smaller in the long term.</p> \n   <p>This would be reflected in real incomes that, in today\u2019s terms, would be up to \u00a32,000 lower per person than otherwise. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Mackay said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The actions of the UK government in attempting to shut down parliament to force through a no-deal outcome means that the UK stands on the cusp of an economic crisis.</p> \n   <p>Alongside my Welsh counterpart, I made it abundantly clear to the chief secretary to the Treasury the impact that a no-deal Brexit will have on Scotland\u2019s economy and jobs.</p> \n   <p>I also urged him to provide a cast-iron guarantee that all lost EU funding will be replaced in full by the UK government. The chief secretary failed to provide those assurances and so I challenged him to work with us to agree a new framework for future funding allocations.</p> \n   <p>With a no-deal scenario looking increasingly more likely, the current financial arrangements are not fit for purpose.</p> \n   <p>We need a new agreement to ensure that the Scottish and Welsh governments have the necessary powers to help mitigate, as best we can, the damage caused by the UK government\u2019s no-deal actions.</p> \n   <p>The decision to only part-fund additional costs resulting from changes to public sector pensions further demonstrates the need for a new framework so that the UK government fairly respects devolved administrations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T18:54:42.594Z\">at 7.54pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6818a28f082209d322405b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T18:27:39.276Z\">7.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Opposition leaders unite against prorogation</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Opposition leaders have demanded that <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> either reverse his decision to suspend parliament or put it to a Commons vote.

He met officials working for EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well as Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s chief of staff, Clara Mart\u00ednez Alberola.</p> \n  <p>According to a diplomatic note of one meeting, seen by the Guardian, Frost downplayed the prime minister\u2019s suspension of parliament, describing it as normal. He also told his interlocutors that Johnson wanted a deal, but was not afraid of no deal.</p> \n  <p>The UK government appears to be seeking to convince the EU that it can bounce parliament into accepting any rewritten deal. Frost told EU officials that it would be possible to ratify a Brexit deal in the second half of October and argued that a technical extension would not be necessary.</p> \n  <p>This strategy matches Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But EU diplomats remain sceptical that a solution to the thorny question of the Irish backstop can be devised in 64 days. The backstop is an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and would keep the UK in an EU customs area until both sides agree another plan. The backstop kicks in automatically, if EU and UK negotiators fail to come up with mutually acceptable alternative arrangements. </p> \n  <p>Many EU insiders that a solution that has eluded experts for two years can be agreed in the next few weeks. One EU diplomat told the Guardian that Frost offered no new ideas on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>EU officials are expecting the UK to propose ideas in the coming weeks; the European commission has said to ensure a deal, it wanted to see those ideas \u201cthe earlier, the better\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Frost, who called for compromise on both sides, is due back in Brussels next week, but the timetable for talks remains unclear. The British government announced both sides would \u201cintensify discussions\u201d as of next week.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T12:23:44.906Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d67b2228f08a5e74d69792c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T11:30:54.181Z\">12.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Updates from the legal attempt to stop the suspension of parliament:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167031811568021505\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Proroguing parliament in this way is \u201cunlawful\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cIt is the duty of the court to declare it as such\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/stopBoris?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#stopBoris</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hOI7dz2Oww\">https://t.co/hOI7dz2Oww</a></p>\u2014 Severin Carrell Esq (@severincarrell) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167031811568021505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167032566492409856\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">O\u2019Neill: \u201cit is that taking away of political accountability that the balance of the constitution requires the courts to come in, to maintain the legal accountability of government for its actions\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/stopBoris?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#stopBoris</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hOI7dz2Oww\">https://t.co/hOI7dz2Oww</a></p>\u2014 Severin Carrell Esq (@severincarrell) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167032566492409856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167032913977925632\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If the court agrees, it must declare the proroguing order by the Queen is \u201cunlawful, unwarranted and unconstitutional\u201d, says O\u2019Neill <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/stopBoris?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#stopBoris</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7ls1ZHhB0j\">https://t.co/7ls1ZHhB0j</a></p>\u2014 Severin Carrell Esq (@severincarrell) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167032913977925632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T11:41:54.237Z\">at 12.41pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d67aea88f082209d3223b3c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T11:07:20.117Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a summary of the latest fallout from Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A legal bid to prevent Johnson from proroguing parliament will be heard in court on Thursday afternoon. </strong>The hearing is scheduled to take place at Parliament House in Edinburgh at 12pm, with Lord Doherty presiding.

For all the elaborate plans of bringing down governments and installing Ken Clarke and Harriet Harman on job shares as prime minister, the simplest way to avoid no deal is to vote for a deal. </p> \n   <p>To colleagues who want to avoid no deal: vote for a deal. You\u2019ve had three opportunities, you blew every one of them don\u2019t blow a fourth. I know the prime minister is seeking to get a deal. I\u2019ve had long conversations with him on this point. And I believe him when he says that he\u2019s seeking to get a deal.

I stared him right in the eye. I asked him out: \u2018I need to know are you actually trying to get a deal or not?\u2019 And he categorically assured me that he was. He believes that his efforts in Biarritz has helped open the door a crack. I know that what would help further would be for people who want to avoid no deal, to come out and say that if a deal is brought back to parliament, that they would back, in the way that they have failed to do three times already. So I want him to get that deal. I believe that\u2019s what he and his government are working towards.

Some of my Tory colleagues, who are cheering at the moment, would have been turning purple with rage.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt sets a very bad precedent for future governments.

He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cIf the only reason for this is to have time for the Queen\u2019s speech, all that was necessary was for an announcement to be made saying that there would be a prorogation while parliament was in recess at the conferences, and we\u2019d assemble for the Queen\u2019s speech immediately after the conference season, you didn\u2019t need the five weeks that\u2019s proposed. There\u2019s a big difference between what happens in a parliamentary recess and a prorogation of parliament because all parliamentary activity shuts down including committees. With a prorogation, if I put down a question to a minister that is guillotined, it just falls away.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe are approaching a really important deadline, we\u2019ve got a big negotiation with the European Union. And we\u2019ve got a deadline of the end of October, which could lead to a no deal. And we need to know more about the government\u2019s preparations for that scenario and more about the negotiations as they continue because our constituents will be affected by those decisions.</p> \n   <p>\u201cReal people want answers and what\u2019s happening under this proposal is parliament is being gagged. And people won\u2019t be able to ask questions and hold ministers to account. I think that is wrong. </p> \n   <p>\u201cWhat prorogation does is prevent parliament from sitting at all.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now, so here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The leaders of the opposition parties have written to the prime minister demanding that he either reverse his decision to suspend parliament or put it to a Commons vote. In a joint statement, they condemned Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cundemocratic\u201d move. The former de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington joined those condemning prorogation, describing it as an attempt to gag parliament. \u201cIf this had been done by a Labour government, Jacob Rees-Mogg would have been leading the denunciations of it,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Lord Young quit as a government whip in the Lords over Boris Johnson\u2019s decision. He said it \u201crisks undermining the fundamental role of parliament\u201d in his resignation letter. Shortly afterwards, Ruth Davidson confirmed her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Although she stressed the decision had been made for family reasons, in her resignation letter she acknowledged: \u201cI have not hidden the conflict I have felt over Brexit.\u201d An attempt was made in a Scottish court to reverse the decision to suspend parliament. Lord Doherty, presiding over the hearing, said he would consider the issue overnight and give his ruling at 10am tomorrow. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was caught on mic apparently admitting the real reason parliament was prorogued. Speaking to his French counterpart at a summit in Helsinki, Wallace could be heard explaining the decision. He said: \u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want. It has been awful at saying what it wants. That\u2019s the reality. So eventually any leader has to, you know, try.\u201d Momentum, the pro-Jeremy Corbyn movement, called for street protests and blockades to stop what it called a coup. Laura Parker, the group\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cOur message to Johnson is this: if you steal our democracy, we\u2019ll shut down the streets.\u201d Corbyn said parliament will \u201clegislate rapidly\u201d on Tuesday, when it resumes, to prevent Boris Johnson from suspending parliament and to stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News, the Labour leader described the move as \u201ca smash-and-grab raid against our democracy\u201d. If you\u2019d like to read yet more on today\u2019s politics news, my colleague Jessica Elgot has the full story: The devolved administrations need greater funding to deal with the effects of Brexit, finance ministers from the Scottish and Welsh governments have claimed. The Welsh finance minister, Rebecca Evans, and the Scottish finance secretary, Derek Mackay, warned that the Treasury\u2019s plans for a one-year spending round \u2013 as opposed to a three-year comprehensive spending review \u2013 will leave them \u201cshort-changed\u201d. Evans said a meeting with the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, on Thursday was \u201clittle comfort\u201d. I am disappointed that the chief secretary failed to provide us with the clarity, honesty and commitment that we have repeatedly called for from the UK government. Despite being promised a three-year comprehensive spending review at our last finance ministers\u2019 meeting, we now face a one-year spending round next week. That review cannot leave us short-changed again. After nine years of austerity, our Welsh government budget is 5% lower in real terms than it was back in 2010. We currently face the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, and in those circumstances, we know that the economy in Wales is likely to be around 10% smaller in the long term. This would be reflected in real incomes that, in today\u2019s terms, would be up to \u00a32,000 lower per person than otherwise. Mackay said: The actions of the UK government in attempting to shut down parliament to force through a no-deal outcome means that the UK stands on the cusp of an economic crisis. Alongside my Welsh counterpart, I made it abundantly clear to the chief secretary to the Treasury the impact that a no-deal Brexit will have on Scotland\u2019s economy and jobs. I also urged him to provide a cast-iron guarantee that all lost EU funding will be replaced in full by the UK government. The chief secretary failed to provide those assurances and so I challenged him to work with us to agree a new framework for future funding allocations. With a no-deal scenario looking increasingly more likely, the current financial arrangements are not fit for purpose. We need a new agreement to ensure that the Scottish and Welsh governments have the necessary powers to help mitigate, as best we can, the damage caused by the UK government\u2019s no-deal actions. The decision to only part-fund additional costs resulting from changes to public sector pensions further demonstrates the need for a new framework so that the UK government fairly respects devolved administrations. Opposition leaders have demanded that Boris Johnson either reverse his decision to suspend parliament or put it to a Commons vote. The leaders of Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group for Change and the Greens, say: It is our view that there is a majority in the House of Commons that does not support this prorogation, and we demand that the prime minister reverses this decision immediately or allows MPs to vote on whether there should be one. We condemn the undemocratic actions of Boris Johnson following his suspension of parliament until 14 October. There is no mandate from the public for a damaging no-deal Brexit. The prime minister is shutting down parliament with the sole aim of stopping MPs from avoiding a no-deal Brexit. This will be the longest prorogation in recent history, and one that comes at a critical moment in the history of our respective nations and the Brexit process. Voters are being deprived of the opportunity to have their representatives hold the government to account, make any key decisions, and ensure there is a lawful basis for any action that is taken. The former justice secretary David Gauke has already made clear his opposition to the prorogation of parliament and his belief that it will embolden opposition to a no-deal Brexit. Now, he has told the BBC: We are very concerned about what no deal is going to involve. It\u2019s probably not in our interests to be very specific about what the proposals might be as to how we would do that. I think there are many of us who would be inclined to say that parliament doesn\u2019t need to take action for a while yet. But, given the announcement from (Wednesday) that parliament is only going to be sitting for a week next week and then really at the end of October \u2013 by which point it will be too late for parliament to do anything effective, then I do think we have to look at what our options are next week. The fact is there isn\u2019t a mandate for a no-deal Brexit. It is not what was campaigned for in 2016. It is not what the public want. According to opinion polls, only about a third of the public would support that and I think as the consequences of no deal become clear, that number may well fall. So, I think parliament does have a responsibility to act and it may well be that next week is the only opportunity for us to do so. The latest Guardian Politics Weekly podcast has just gone out. Jessica Elgot and her guests react to the prime minister\u2019s suspension of parliament for five weeks from mid-September, an act the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, called a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said was a \u201cthreat to our democracy\u201d Jessica is joined by the Guardian journalists Rafael Behr, Owen Jones and Sonia Sodha to analyse Boris Johnson\u2019s motives and what steps are available for MPs returning to the Commons next week. Richard Harrington, a former Tory minister and a vocal critic both Boris Johnson and Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategies, will stand down at the next general election. The MP for Watford resigned as a business minister in March and said May\u2019s government was \u201cplaying roulette with the lives and livelihoods of the vast majority of people in this country\u201d. Following Wednesday\u2019s news that Johnson plans to prorogue parliament, Harrington has told the Watford Observer: I think suspending parliament increases a no-deal and I will do everything in my power to ensure that won\u2019t happen. The more time there is to debate, the more chance there is of reaching a compromise. According to the Sun, Harrington also indicated he would vote to block a no-deal Brexit. In a statement explaining his decision to stand down, Harrington added: Having had the privilege of serving as MP for Watford for almost 10 years, I have decided to retire from frontline politics. It had always been my intention to step down at the next general election, due under the Fixed Term Parliament Act in 2022. However, with the current increasing uncertainty about an earlier election, I believe it right for me to make clear my intentions now. Therefore, I have told my constituency chairman that I will not be offering myself for selection as the Conservative party candidate for the next general election, whenever that may be. Until then, I shall continue to devote myself to serving all my constituents \u2013 as I have done since they first elected me in 2010. In that general election, we Conservatives took what was then a closely contested three-way marginal seat from Labour. I am proud that we subsequently held the seat in the general elections of 2015 and 2017 and I give my sincere thanks to voters for the confidence they have shown in me. Being MP for Watford has allowed me to meet so many people from visiting schools, businesses, charities and other organisations and groups. I have learned a great deal from them. I will continue to offer my support for such community groups in the future, and will do my best to help my successor, in whatever way I can. Harrington voted three times for the withdrawal agreement and has also indicated his support for a second referendum in the past. Here\u2019s an evening summary of yet another astonishing day in politics: The former de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington joined those condemning prorogation, describing it as an attempt to gag parliament. \u201cIf this had been done by a Labour government, Jacob Rees-Mogg would have been leading the denunciations of it,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Lord Young quit as a government whip in the Lords over Boris Johnson\u2019s decision, saying it \u201crisks undermining the fundamental role of parliament\u201d in his resignation letter. Shortly after, Ruth Davidson confirmed her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Although she stressed the decision had been made for family reasons, in her resignation letter she acknowledged: \u201cI have not hidden the conflict I have felt over Brexit.\u201d An attempt was made in a Scottish court to reverse the decision to suspend parliament. Lord Doherty, presiding over the hearing, said he would consider the issue overnight and give his ruling at 10am tomorrow. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was caught on mic apparently admitting the real reason parliament was prorogued. Speaking to his French counterpart at a summit in Helsinki, Wallace could be heard explaining the decision. He said: \u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want. It has been awful at saying what it wants. That\u2019s the reality. So eventually any leader has to, you know, try.\u201d Momentum, the pro-Jeremy Corbyn movement, called for street protests and blockades to stop what it called a coup. Laura Parker, the group\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cOur message to Johnson is this: if you steal our democracy, we\u2019ll shut down the streets.\u201d Corbyn said parliament will \u201clegislate rapidly\u201d on Tuesday, when it resumes, to prevent Boris Johnson from suspending parliament and to stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News, the Labour leader described the move as \u201ca smash-and-grab raid against our democracy\u201d. I\u2019m off now - my colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over. Richard J Evans, one of Britain\u2019s foremost historians of Germany and the Third Reich, has written a piece for Prospect magazine in which he compares present day Britain and the US to Weimar Germany. He notes there have been signals that a potential vote of no confidence could be shrugged off with contempt by Boris Johnson. \u201cIf that were to happen, parliamentary democracy would truly be in trouble in this country. This is Britain\u2019s Reichstag Fire Decree moment,\u201d Evans writes. Speaking in Dunfermline, at the start of a three-day tour of Scotland, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, insisted MPs could still have time to move legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit, but also had some cautionary words for Scottish nationalists. While the SNP leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, yesterday said that Boris Johnson\u2019s conduct in shutting down parliament had made independence \u201calmost inevitable\u201d - and Ruth Davidson\u2019s resignation has also prompted speculation about the future of the union - today Corbyn warned that a Labour government would not allow another Scottish independence vote to be held in its \u201cformative years\u201d. Earlier this month, Corbyn\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told an Edinburgh fringe event that a Labour government would not oppose a second independence referendum \u2013 directly contradicting Scottish Labour policy. Today Corbyn said: \u201cI want there to be a Labour government in this country and I want that Labour government to be able to deliver for the people of Scotland as for the rest of the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s not my priority that there should be an independence referendum in Scotland.\u201d More protests are being announced. On Tuesday, Ireland-based Brits are scheduled to rally outside the British embassy in Dublin against Brexit and the suspension of parliament, TheJournal.ie reports. Campaign group Brits Not Out was formed in response to Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament. \u201cWe are calling on the many British nationals who have made their lives in Ireland to join our protest against this outrageous and undemocratic act,\u201d spokesperson Grace Williams told the publication. \u201cWe care deeply about British democracy and the negative impact that Brexit \u2013 especially a hard Brexit \u2013 will have on our families, friends and communities in the UK. And we care equally about the threat that Brexit poses to jobs, peace and prosperity on this island, where we\u2019ve been welcomed and where are now living our lives.\u201d Other MPs\u2019 positions on the subject of prorogation are also coming under scrutiny. Tory MP Alex Clark has been facing pro-EU protesters outside his office in Cheltenham. He told constituents that \u201cthe actual concrete practical difference\u201d of suspending parliament is modest but admitted \u201cthe political implications are great\u201d. He added, in footage posted to Twitter by BBC reporter Hayley Mortimer: \u201cI\u2019ve made my position clear, what the implications of that are will be for the chief whip.\u201d Downing Street has reacted to that on-air gaffe earlier by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. He apparently \u201cmisspoke\u201d: The Labour leader has said parliament will \u201clegislate rapidly\u201d on Tuesday, when it resumes, to prevent Boris Johnson from suspending parliament and stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News, Corbyn said: \u201cWe will be back in parliament on Tuesday to challenge Boris Johnson on what I think is a smash-and-grab raid against our democracy. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to suspend parliament in order to prevent a serious discussion and a serious debate to prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is try to politically stop him on Tuesday with a parliamentary process in order to legislate to prevent a no-deal Brexit and also to try and prevent him shutting down parliament during this utterly crucial period.\u201d Hi, this is Amy Walker taking over from Matt Weaver. David Miliband, the former foreign secretary, has spoken about the prorogation of parliament on a visit to Venezuelan refugees in Colombia (in his role as chief executive of the International Rescue Committee). He told the Guardian\u2019s Joe Parkin Daniels: \u201cIt\u2019s an appalling day for British parliamentary democracy. The idea that parliament is a threat to good government rather than the basis of good government is completely contrary to everything we know about British history, never mind international history. I think that it is absolutely right for parliamentarians to fight for their right to sit and to hold government to account not just on Brexit but on a range of issues. The excuses that have been given by the government this morning have been truly pathetic. A strong government welcomes a strong parliament, one can only conclude that it is a weak government if it fears parliamentary scrutiny.\u201d An application at the high court to challenge Boris Johnson\u2019s move in London is \u201cbeing considered\u201d, a spokeswoman for the judiciary has said. An urgent application for a judicial review has been made by campaigner Gina Miller, who previously won a landmark ruling that MPs would have to vote before the government could invoke article 50 to formally start the UK\u2019s exit process from the EU. The judiciary spokeswoman said on Thursday: \u201cWe can confirm that an application for judicial review has been received from Gina Miller. The defendant is the prime minister. The application is being considered.\u201d Philip Pullman has denied wanting to hang Boris Johnson after being widely criticised for a tweet about the prime minister, PA reports. The author said in a since-deleted post on Twitter that he thinks of a \u201crope\u201d and \u201cthe nearest lamp-post\u201d when he hears Johnson\u2019s name. After the backlash Pullman said he had made a \u201ctactical error\u201d but refused to apologise for his anger at the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament. In the original tweet, Pullman said: \u201cWhen I hear the name \u2018Boris Johnson\u2019, for some reason the words \u2018rope\u2019 and \u2018nearest lamp-post\u2019 come to mind as well.\u201d Following criticism online, the Northern Lights author blamed recent political events for his post and said he wanted to make it \u201cperfectly clear\u201d that he did not want to kill the prime minister. Daniel Hannan, the arch Eurosceptic Tory MEP, is warning of another Windrush scandal after being contacted by EU nationals denied settled status after Brexit. Hannan is echoing concerns of the Labour party. When the home secretary, Priti Patel, suggested ending freedom of movement immediately on 31 October, Jeremy Corbyn warned this could lead to a situation like \u201cWindrush on steroids\u201d. Momentum, the grassroots group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn, has called for street protests and road blockades to stop what it calls a coup. Laura Parker, the group\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cOur message to Johnson is this: if you steal our democracy, we\u2019ll shut down the streets.\u201d Momentum, together with trade unions, have organised protests in Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Oxford, Sheffield and York on Saturday and a further demonstration in London next Tuesday when parliament returns. Parker will be joining an occupation of parliament next week. She said: \u201cEton-educated, millionaire Boris Johnson is stealing our democracy so he can sell off our NHS to big US corporations in a no-deal, Trump-first Brexit. This is an establishment coup by a tiny, privileged elite who have been eroding our democracy for decades. Real power doesn\u2019t sit with the Queen or in parliament. It\u2019s with us, the people \u2013 and that\u2019s why we need to take action. There are thousands of us who will join an occupation of parliament and block the roads before we let Johnson close the doors on democracy. Today we\u2019re going to contact all Momentum supporters and encourage them to protest, occupy and blockade on Saturday.\u201d Irish ministers have distanced themselves from comments made by a government colleague who compared Boris Johnson to Oliver Cromwell, PA reports. In a tweet, which he later deleted, the minister of state, Michael D\u2019Arcy, said the UK prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament was \u201cperhaps the most anti-democratic decision since the Protectorate government, which Oliver Cromwell set up, was established\u201d. The minister for business, Heather Humphreys, said: \u201cFirst of all, Minister D\u2019Arcy has removed that tweet. \u201cAs far as we are concerned, we are not going to comment on internal British politics.\u201d The minister for communications, Richard Bruton, said: \u201cWe are not going to get involved in British politics because they have a lot of decisions to make. \u201cUndoubtedly, the decisions that they make will have a big impact on us and we need to give them the time and space to do that,\u201d Bruton said. Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend the House of Commons created a greater risk of a hard Brexit. \u201cVery clearly, the issue of resolving this is in Boris Johnson\u2019s court and I think we await the developments in British politics,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s PA\u2019s take on the legal bid in Scotland highest civil court to try to prevent Johnson from suspending parliament. A cross-party group of around 70 MPs and peers are backing the action at the court of session in Edinburgh after beginning a legal move earlier in the summer when they filed a petition aiming to stop Johnson being able to prorogue parliament. They are now seeking an interim interdict, which would stop the prime minister taking the option of suspension until a final decision has been made on the case. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, representing the petitioners, said the prorogation was \u201cunprecedented\u201d and the petitioners are invoking the court\u2019s \u201cconstitutional jurisdiction\u201d. He said: \u201cProrogation is being used to create something which is irreversible, that the UK will be made to leave the EU deal or no deal, do or die, and parliament is being prevented by abuse of the power of prorogation from doing anything about it. There are no precedents for the abuse of prorogation. \u201cThe power of prorogation is not one which is unlimited or unfettered but has to be used in accordance with public trust.\u201d The case is being heard by Lord Doherty. O\u2019Neill said the Queen should be obliged to recall the prorogation order if it turned out to be based on an error of law. He said: \u201cIf the court is satisfied that the advice to the sovereign given yesterday that parliament be prorogued is in fact found to be an abuse of power based on an error of law, then there should be an obligation on the sovereign to recall that order of prorogation because the sovereign is not above the law.\u201d The legal challenge is being led by SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, aided by Jo Maugham of the Good Law Project. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest fallout from Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. The government is facing three legal challenges to try to block the suspension of parliament. A high court in Belfast held an urgent hearing for an injunction against the prime minister, following similar legal battles launched in Scotland and England by the SNP justice spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, and the campaigner Gina Miller. Ruth Davidson has confirmed her decision to resign as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. In her resignation letter she cited both the conflict she feels over Brexit and her desire to achieve a better balance between her working and family life. Boris Johnson has suffered his first ministerial resignation, as George Young quit the Tory frontbench in the Lords over the PM\u2019s decision to suspend parliament in September. In his resignation letter as a government whip in the House of Lords, Young said he was \u201cvery unhappy at the timing and length of the prorogation, and its motivation\u201d. A petition calling on the government not to prorogue parliament has already been signed by more than 1.4 million people. The petition is growing even faster than the petition to revoke article 50, which eventually had 6m signatures. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has been caught on mic admitting uncertainty over what happens next in the Brexit process and conceding the weakness of the government grip on power. Speaking at a gathering of defence ministers in Helsinki, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the outcome will be ... we\u2019ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority and a coalition and that\u2019s not easy for our system.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has defended the decision to suspend parliament and claimed the outpouring of outrage it triggered was \u201cconfected\u201d. He also accused the Speaker, John Bercow, of being constitutionally \u201cimproper\u201d by criticising the move. Former cabinet ministers including David Gauke and David Lidington have joined those condemning prorogation. Lidington described it as an attempt to gag parliament. Gauke said next week was the only chance parliament had to stop a no-deal exit. Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said that if he was in post under a government that prorogued parliament in the way Johnson did, he would resign. \u201cI think it is unacceptable behaviour going on at the moment,\u201d he said. Ruth Davidson had a frosty relationship with Boris Johnson, which she alluded to in her press conference. But Johnson glossed over those differences in a three-tweet tribute to her. The former justice secretary, David Gauke, has also piled in. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 World at One programme he said: \u201cIt is not routine to prorogue parliament for five weeks. I don\u2019t believe it is the right thing to do when we face such a crucial question about our future relationship with the European Union. The government should be scrutinised whether it\u2019s on no-deal planning, whether it\u2019s on the negotiations, the government should be held to account by parliamentarians.\u201d Gauke added: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that there is a mandate for leaving without a deal. That\u2019s isn\u2019t what was put to the people in 2016 by those campaigning to leave. And I think it would cause significant detrimental effect to the economic outlook for this country and for the integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201d He also conceded it was unclear how parliament could stop a no-deal and but he appeared to rule out backing a no-confidence motion in the government. I\u2019ve consistently said that I don\u2019t want to see Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. I also have to say, I think that a vote of no confidence in these circumstances is not the correct way forward. What would then happen is that we would run into a general election. Unless another form of government was able to be created, which I very much doubt, then the existing government would be able run down the clock and take us beyond 31 of October. So I don\u2019t believe that that is the right approach. Parliament may need to act to stop a no deal. It does look like next week is essentially the only opportunity parliament will have to maintain some control over this process and ensure that it has a say before we leave without a deal. I don\u2019t think one can rule out the possibility of parliament being able to find a way through this. The lord chief justice in Northern Ireland is to consider whether to grant an immediate injunction to block the suspension of parliament at a full hearing tomorrow. Sir Declan Norman broke his summer holiday for a 20-minute urgent hearing this morning for an application by campaigner Raymond McCord, who has argued that a no-deal Brexit would be a breach of the Good Friday agreement. He instructed both parties to return to court tomorrow with their \u201cexpanded arguments\u201d. \u201cWe are seeking an urgent injunction to compel Boris Johnson to reverse his advice to the queen to prorogue parliament,\u201d said McCord\u2019s lawyer, Ciaran O\u2019Hare. O\u2019Hare says the decision to hear the case while the court is not in session shows the seriousness with which the judge is taking the case. \u201cWe are confident. You now have cases in Scotland and England but in terms of litigation we believe that the Northern Ireland case is the most urgent because we argue the consequences of no deal here are worse than anywhere else in the UK,\u201d he said. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has been caught on mic admitting uncertainty about what happens next in the Brexit process and conceding the weakness of the government grip on power. Speaking to his French counterpart at a defence summit in Helsinki, Wallace could be heard explaining the decision to prorogue parliament. He said: \u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want. It has been awful at saying what it wants. That\u2019s the reality. So eventually any leader has to, you know, try.\u201d Shrugging and laughing he added: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the outcome will be, you know politics.\u201d He added this about the government\u2019s weakness: \u201cOur system is a winner-takes-all system. If you win a parliamentary majority you control everything, you control the timetable. There\u2019s no written separation. So it\u2019s, you pretty much are in command of the whole thing. And we\u2019ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority and a coalition and that\u2019s not easy for our system. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, appears to accept the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson has been labelled a \u201cdictator\u201d by John McDonnell, PA reports. The shadow chancellor said Downing Street was being run like the Bullingdon Club, an elite group of Oxford students attended by both Johnson and former prime minister David Cameron. He accused Johnson of \u201ctreating us like serfs\u201d and warned the public would not tolerate his antics after the PM\u2019s controversial decision to suspend parliament for more than a month. MPs\u2019 powers will be effectively suspended from 12 September until the Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October after the Queen ratified Johnson\u2019s request for a suspension of more than four weeks - the longest prorogation in modern memory. McDonnell said: \u201cI just give Boris Johnson this warning, really. Trying to undermine the very institution that people have given their lives for, to secure this democracy \u2013 to try to undermine that flies in the face of a whole history and centuries of democratic advancement in this country. \u201cI don\u2019t think the British people will tolerate that. They have stood up to dictators before and they will stand up to this one as well.\u201d Some cabinet ministers have been much quicker to pay tribute to Ruth Davidson than they have to defend Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. A legal bid in Belfast to injunct Boris Johnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament has been adjourned for 24 hours. The injunction application was made by prominent victims campaigner Raymond McCord, who was already pursing legal proceedings against the potential proroguing of parliament. Northern Ireland\u2019s lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, sat in Belfast high court on Thursday morning for a briefing hearing during which he gave the legal parties 24 hours to prepare for a substantive hearing, which will be heard at 10am on Friday. Afterwards, McCord told the PA news agency: \u201cI don\u2019t want a Brexit, more importantly I don\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit and also I don\u2019t want parliament suspended. \u201cI think it is totally against the democratic process and it\u2019s unconstitutional, and it\u2019s being done for political purposes - it\u2019s not being done for the good of the people.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit envoy offered the European Union no new ideas in finding a way out of the Brexit impasse, Brussels sources have said. David Frost, the prime minister\u2019s Europe adviser, held a series of meetings at EU institutions in Brussels on Wednesday. He met officials working for EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well as Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s chief of staff, Clara Mart\u00ednez Alberola. According to a diplomatic note of one meeting, seen by the Guardian, Frost downplayed the prime minister\u2019s suspension of parliament, describing it as normal. He also told his interlocutors that Johnson wanted a deal, but was not afraid of no deal. The UK government appears to be seeking to convince the EU that it can bounce parliament into accepting any rewritten deal. Frost told EU officials that it would be possible to ratify a Brexit deal in the second half of October and argued that a technical extension would not be necessary. This strategy matches Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d. But EU diplomats remain sceptical that a solution to the thorny question of the Irish backstop can be devised in 64 days. The backstop is an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and would keep the UK in an EU customs area until both sides agree another plan. The backstop kicks in automatically, if EU and UK negotiators fail to come up with mutually acceptable alternative arrangements. Many EU insiders that a solution that has eluded experts for two years can be agreed in the next few weeks. One EU diplomat told the Guardian that Frost offered no new ideas on Wednesday. EU officials are expecting the UK to propose ideas in the coming weeks; the European commission has said to ensure a deal, it wanted to see those ideas \u201cthe earlier, the better\u201d. Frost, who called for compromise on both sides, is due back in Brussels next week, but the timetable for talks remains unclear. The British government announced both sides would \u201cintensify discussions\u201d as of next week. Updates from the legal attempt to stop the suspension of parliament: Here\u2019s a summary of the latest fallout from Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament: A legal bid to prevent Johnson from proroguing parliament will be heard in court on Thursday afternoon. The hearing is scheduled to take place at Parliament House in Edinburgh at 12pm, with Lord Doherty presiding. A separate attempt to stop the move is also under way at the high court in Belfast. Ruth Davidson has confirmed her decision to resign as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. In her resignation letter she cited both the conflict she feels over Brexit and her desire to achieve a better balance between her working and family life. Lord Young of Cookham, a government whip in the Lords, has resigned. He said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the decision to prorogue parliament for an extended period as the the 31 October deadline for Brexit looms. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has defended the decision to suspend parliament and claimed the outpouring of outrage it triggered was \u201cconfected\u201d. He also accused the Speaker, John Bercow, of being constitutionally \u201cimproper\u201d by criticising the move. The former de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington has joined those condemning prorogation, describing it as an attempt to gag parliament. He said: \u201cIt prevents MPs from asking questions. It prevents many ministers from being held to account by parliamentary select committees. And I think that is not a good way to do democracy.\u201d Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said that if he was in post under a government that prorogued parliament in the way Johnson did, he would resign. \u201cI think it is unacceptable behaviour going on at the moment,\u201d he said. An attempt in a Scottish court to reverse the decision to suspend parliament has been brought forward to noon today. Lawyers acting for the Scottish National party\u2019s Joanna Cherry and 74 other MPs and peers had expected to be in court in Edinburgh on Friday morning to urge Scotland\u2019s civil court, the court of session, to block the suspension of parliament. The hearing is scheduled to take place at Parliament House at 12pm, with Lord Doherty presiding. Jolyon Maugham QC, the anti-Brexit lawyer who helped coordinate the legal challenge through his Good Law Project, said they believed the courts would be able to reverse the decision even though it had been approved by the Queen. Asked for his response to the prospect of an early election, McDonnell said: \u201cBring it on. The issue for us now is that we have to do everything we can, working on a cross-party basis, to block a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the impact it could have on our country and living standards. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll work on. We\u2019ll use every parliamentary device we possibly can. If that means a vote of no confidence at some stage, then we\u2019re open to it, that is on the table.\u201d Reaction to Davidson\u2019s resignation: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the upcoming spending review was a \u201cpanic-driven stunt\u201d. He said: \u201cNobody is fooled that this is a proper and normal spending review. It is a one-year only, panic-driven stunt budget.\u201d McDonnell said Boris Johnson and the chancellor, Sajid Javid, were attempting to \u201cshift enough votes to get them into power\u201d with next Wednesday\u2019s expected statement. He added: \u201cIf nothing else, this has proved what we have said all along. Austerity was always a political choice, not an economic necessity.\u201d McDonnell said Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for more than a month shows his \u201cdeep-seated arrogant sense of entitlement\u201d. He added: \u201cThe last 24 hours have revealed the true character of Boris Johnson and, as importantly, the real nature of his politics. \u201cIt\u2019s exposed in Johnson a deep-seated arrogant sense of entitlement. Johnson sees himself not as a modern-day prime minister, whose authority rests upon the support of a parliamentary democracy. \u201cInstead, his actions betray that he\u2019s reverted to a much older Tory tradition. He\u2019s a ruler, ruling over the ruled. \u201cDemocratic practices like parliamentary votes have become encumbrances to the freedom of the ruler. And how dare the broadcast media seek to pose questions and ask for an interview or anything more than a short clip of him grinning.\u201d Davidson stopped short of condemning Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. Here\u2019s what she told journalists: We had three golden opportunities to support a deal. The people right now who are saying they would do anything to avoid no deal had a goal gaping in front of them three times and they hit the ball over the bar. For all the elaborate plans of bringing down governments and installing Ken Clarke and Harriet Harman on job shares as prime minister, the simplest way to avoid no deal is to vote for a deal. To colleagues who want to avoid no deal: vote for a deal. You\u2019ve had three opportunities, you blew every one of them don\u2019t blow a fourth. I know the prime minister is seeking to get a deal. I\u2019ve had long conversations with him on this point. And I believe him when he says that he\u2019s seeking to get a deal. And please ... make it clear now that if a deal comes back to the House of Commons, you will vote for it and let the EU hear you say that you will vote for it so that they understand that there is a reason for them to reopen negotiations. If the prime minister brings a deal back to the House of Commons as I know he is trying to do, for God\u2019s sake, get behind it and this time at the fourth time of asking vote for it. I stand absolutely foursquare behind the prime minister\u2019s attempts to bring back a deal that can pass in the House of Commons. There has been a lot that\u2019s been written about my relationship with the prime minister and I went out to Downing Street to meet him last week in a private meeting. I stared him right in the eye. I asked him out: \u2018I need to know are you actually trying to get a deal or not?\u2019 And he categorically assured me that he was. He believes that his efforts in Biarritz has helped open the door a crack. I know that what would help further would be for people who want to avoid no deal, to come out and say that if a deal is brought back to parliament, that they would back, in the way that they have failed to do three times already. So I want him to get that deal. I believe that\u2019s what he and his government are working towards. And I support him in those efforts. In her Q&amp;A with reporters, Davidson urged MPs to vote for a deal to avoid a no-deal Brexit at the \u201cfourth time of asking\u201d. Repeating what she told Boris Johnson in private, Davidson called on the prime minister to secure a deal in Brussels. She said Johnson \u201ccategorically\u201d assured her that he was trying to get a deal. \u201cI support him in that effort,\u201d she said. An attempt to injunct Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament is under way at the high court in Belfast. The application for an injunction has been made by solicitors acting for the victims campaigner Raymond McCord. In a statement, McCord\u2019s lawyers said a hearing had been granted for 10am this morning in front of the lord chief justice. McCord is already involved in one of three sets of legal proceedings arguing a no-deal Brexit would breach the Good Friday agreement and his case was listed as the lead case with a hearing scheduled for next month. Ruth Davidson is making a statement on her resignation in Edinburgh. In her resignation letter Davidson added: I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend. The party and my work has always come first, often at the expense of commitments to loved ones. The arrival of my son means I now make a different choice.\u201d Ruth Davidson has confirmed her resignation as leader of the Conservatives in Scotland. In her resignation letter she stressed the decision was made for family reasons but acknowledges: \u201cI have not hidden the conflict I have felt over Brexit.\u201d Lord Young has quit as a government whip in the Lords over Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. In his resignation letter he said: \u201cI am very unhappy at the timing and length of the prorogation ... [it] risks undermining the fundamental role of parliament.\u201d Cabinet ministers who have in the very recent past expressed opposition to proroguing parliament are now tight-lipped. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, declined to answer questions on the suspension of parliament during a visit to Belfast. In June, Rudd described the suggestion of proroguing parliament as \u201cabsolutely outrageous\u201d, \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d. She did not comment on the matter when asked about it by PA Media after visiting a jobs and benefits office in east Belfast, instead insisting she was focused on her job. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to do my job as secretary of state for work and pensions,\u201d she said. Sir Tom Devine, Scotland\u2019s pre-eminent modern historian, has called for mass protests against Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. Devine, professor emeritus at the University of Edinburgh, said those protests would not succeed in overturning Johnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament without MPs from all parties also showing \u201cguile and spine\u201d by blocking it at Westminster. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Devine said: \u201cWe are now at a very considerable and dangerous crossroads in our democracy. [I] think it\u2019s time for the people to react through mass protest.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a crisis and this is an emergency.\u201d The author of several bestselling histories of Scotland and its global diaspora, Devine was knighted in 2014, given the royal medal by the Queen in 2001 and made an OBE in 2005. He cited the warnings yesterday from Lord Kerslake, the former head of the UK civil service, that civil servants needed to examine their consciences about enabling Johnson\u2019s policies, and also the PM\u2019s decision to make the Queen agree to prorogument. That was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d and risked damaging popular respect for the monarchy, Devine said. Party leaders should consider cancelling their annual party conferences, due to start next month. Beyond the current crisis, Johnson\u2019s gambit would also fuel support for Scottish independence. Johnson was \u201cthe greatest recruiting sergeant for the SNP and for independence since Margaret Thatcher,\u201d Devine said. \u201cWe have unambiguous evidence of the complete indifference of this current gang to preserve the union. This is another major blow, another major battering ram against the integrity of what the previous prime minister called \u2018our precious union\u2019. \u201cIt is almost as if Johnson and his ilk has conceived a plan to destroy the UK because of their exclusive obsession with delivering Brexit.\u201d That petition against proroguing parliament has now passed 1.3m. A YouGov poll for the Times, conducted before Johnson prorogued parliament, puts the Conservatives 12% above Labour. Sam Gyimah, the former universities minister who resigned over Brexit, has become the latest Tory backbencher to criticise the suspension of parliament. Speaking to BBC News, he said: \u201cWe know that if Jeremy Corbyn had done this they would have rightly criticised him for using Trotskyite tactics to get his way. \u201cWe should not be using those tactics ourselves.\u201d Gyimah said that suspending parliament was part of a plan to \u201cmuzzle\u201d MPs over a no-deal Brexit. He added: \u201cWhat is so worrying is what we are reading in the papers that this is the first in a series of moves to make sure parliament is muzzled on the subject of scrutinising Brexit. \u201cIf Boris Johnson genuinely believes that his position of a no-deal Brexit is the will of the people, then rather than trafficking our constitution he should go to the people for a mandate. There is no mandate for a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn is in Scotland, where he said a second referendum on independence would not take place in the \u201cformative years\u201d of a Labour government. PA Media has this: The Labour leader said if he was voted into Downing Street he would be focused on the \u201ccentral priorities\u201d of dealing with Brexit, ending austerity and acting to tackle the climate emergency. He said: \u201cIn the formative years of a Labour government we wouldn\u2019t agree to another independence referendum because we will be fully focused on these central priorities. \u201cHowever, if at some future point there was a legitimate and fresh mandate, we wouldn\u2019t block it.\u201d Scottish Labour had been opposed to another ballot on independence being held, after voters backed staying in the UK by 55% to 45% in 2014. However, the UK shadow chancellor, John McDonnell ,recently said the party would not stand in the way of a second referendum. Richard Leonard, the party\u2019s Scottish leader, said he was in agreement with Corbyn on the timing of a possible second ballot. He confirmed: \u201cJeremy and I have agreed that, during the formative years of an incoming Labour government, we would not sanction a Section 30 order to allow a further referendum on Scottish independence to take place.\u201d Leonard added: \u201cIt would also only be acceptable to a Labour government to allow a second referendum to proceed if it could be demonstrated that there was a fresh mandate for such a vote to be held. This would require a democratic mandate from the people of Scotland, which clearly signals the majority of people are in favour of a new vote. \u201cI do not believe that the conditions exist for such a move today, nor will they for the foreseeable future.\u201d Details of the agreement between the two leaders on the timing of a possible Scottish referendum emerged ahead of Corbyn making a campaign trip north of the border. And he argued that, while a no-deal Brexit would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Scotland and the rest of the UK, ending the union with England would worsen austerity for Scots and \u201ccreate more instability and chaos\u201d. Corbyn said: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s pursuit of a no-deal Brexit will be a disaster for the whole country. He is putting at risk Scottish jobs in manufacturing, food processing and service industries. His intention to suspend parliament shows he is also a threat to our democracy.\u201d Ruth Davidson has spoken briefly to the Scottish Daily Mail in advance of her press conference later this morning. She said that, whilst she understood the speculation around her decision and its timing, her departure had been planned prior to the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament yesterday. Davidson said: \u201cThose of us who are lucky enough to serve in political leadership accept the toll it takes, but there\u2019s a part of us which can never accept the effect it has in family and friends.\u201d She added that her party was in \u201cgreat shape\u201d and would continue to hold the SNP to account. Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, is to give a statement at 11am when she is expected to resign. Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said that if he was in post under a government that prorogued parliament in the way Johnson did, he would resign. Yesterday he told Polly Toynbee: \u201cWe are reaching the point where the civil service must consider putting its stewardship of the country ahead of service to the government of the day.\u201d Kerslake told Today: \u201cIt\u2019s for each individual to consider how far this has gone\u201d. John Bercow gave an interesting interview to Tortoise Media before yesterday\u2019s decision. Asked if parliament could stop a no deal, he said: \u201cYes it can have its say. It will decide what it wants. The idea that parliament would be evacuated from the centre stage of Brexit decision-making is unimaginable, it is inconceivable and it simply is not going to happen.\u201d He added: \u201cNaysayers contending there is nothing MPs can do, they are entitled to their opinion, but they suffer from the very grave disadvantage of being wrong.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg has also criticised Gus O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, for claiming the government put the Queen in a difficult position by asking her to approve the prorogation of parliament. Rees-Mogg told Today: \u201cIt was simply wrong and deeply irresponsible of him to say that. The Queen had no discretion over this. There is no precedent for the Queen refusing a request by her prime minister under these circumstances. \u201cThis is a straightforward decision by the prime minister giving formal advice to the sovereign, which a constitutional monarch is obliged to follow. Lord O\u2019Donnell is saying things that are damaging to the constitution and wrong.\u201d Rees-Mogg gave no details of his meeting with the Queen at Balmoral yesterday, but he said there was no discussion about prorogation, the Queen simply approved the decision. And he continued to maintain that what was done was within law and precedent. He said: \u201cThe number of sitting days that is lost is in line with the averages going back to the second world war.\u201d Rees-Mogg also claimed that the comments by the Speaker, John Bercow, were \u201cthe most constitutionally improper thing that happened yesterday\u201d. He added: \u201cThe candyfloss of outrage that we\u2019ve had over the past 24 hours \u2013 which is almost entirely confected \u2013 is from people who never wanted to leave the European Union. \u201cThe law of the land is that we leave the European Union, and parliament voted for that on the back of a referendum where 17.4 million people voted to leave. That\u2019s not railroading. That\u2019s delivering a proper constitutional settlement.\u201d Here\u2019s a chart on what\u2019s likely to happen in the next few weeks: Nick Boles, who resigned the Tory whip over Brexit, has this: The former de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington has joined those condemning prorogation, describing it as an attempt to gag parliament. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cIf this had been done by a Labour government, Jacob Rees-Mogg would have been leading the denunciations of it. Some of my Tory colleagues, who are cheering at the moment, would have been turning purple with rage. \u201cIt sets a very bad precedent for future governments. It\u2019s a pretty good rule that if you are tempted to play around with parliamentary and constitutional procedure, don\u2019t do something that you wouldn\u2019t want a government of a different party to do to you.\u201d Lidington also questioned Johnson\u2019s rationale for the move. He said: \u201cIf the only reason for this is to have time for the Queen\u2019s speech, all that was necessary was for an announcement to be made saying that there would be a prorogation while parliament was in recess at the conferences, and we\u2019d assemble for the Queen\u2019s speech immediately after the conference season, you didn\u2019t need the five weeks that\u2019s proposed. There\u2019s a big difference between what happens in a parliamentary recess and a prorogation of parliament because all parliamentary activity shuts down including committees. With a prorogation, if I put down a question to a minister that is guillotined, it just falls away. \u201cWe are approaching a really important deadline, we\u2019ve got a big negotiation with the European Union. And we\u2019ve got a deadline of the end of October, which could lead to a no deal. And we need to know more about the government\u2019s preparations for that scenario and more about the negotiations as they continue because our constituents will be affected by those decisions. \u201cReal people want answers and what\u2019s happening under this proposal is parliament is being gagged. And people won\u2019t be able to ask questions and hold ministers to account. I think that is wrong. \u201cWhat prorogation does is prevent parliament from sitting at all. And it prevents MPs from asking questions. It prevents many ministers from being held to account by parliamentary select committees. And I think that is not a good way to do democracy.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has claimed the Speaker, John Bercow, was being unconstitutional by criticising the suspension of parliament. Bercow described Johnson\u2019s move to prorogue parliament as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. But Rees-Mogg claimed it was Bercow who was acting outside the constitution by making such comments, and cited William Lenthall, who served as Speaker during the English civil war. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Rees-Mogg said: There is a constitutional problem with what Mr Speaker said. Speaker Lenthall said that he \u2018had not eyes to see nor tongue to speak unless directed by the house\u2019. It is not constitutional for the speaker to express his opinion without direction of the house. He has had no such direction. And therefore his comments were in a private capacity they cannot be as Mr Speaker. What he said from holiday yesterday was not directed by the house.\u201d Rees-Mogg added that the move to prorogue parliament is not intended to limit the time available for MPs to debate Brexit and will allow the government to tackle other issues. He said: Parliament wasn\u2019t going to be sitting for most of this time anyway. This is completely constitutional and proper. There is going to be a lot of time to debate before 31 October.\u201d The outrage directed towards the move is \u201cphoney\u201d and created by people who do not want the UK to leave the EU, he added. The shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, has conceded that it will now be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for parliament to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Gardiner condemned the suspension of parliament for five weeks as \u201can unprecedented outrage designed to prevent parliament passing legislation that would stop the government taking the country out of the EU without a deal\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is a majority in parliament who believe that leaving without a deal was not something that was suggested during the referendum. It\u2019s not something that even leave voters considered. And there is no mandate for this.\u201d Asked what parliament could do to prevent a no-deal Brexit, Gardiner said: It\u2019s going to be extremely difficult. And that\u2019s why the government is disingenuous to say that this is not about trying to stop us doing that. We will be seeking measures on Monday, to try and have what\u2019s known as a standing order section 24 debate. And we will seek to try and put through the appropriate legislation in this constrained timetable that the government has now imposed. Downing Street is lying when it claims that this is about the conference recess. If he simply wanted to get on with his domestic agenda, he would actually be having a shorter period of prorogation. It extremely difficult to get the necessary legislation through that would stop a no deal for which this prime minister has no mandate and could have no mandate.\u201d One last front page from me (thank you to the kind reader who sent it to me) before I hand the blog over to Matthew Weaver. Thanks for keeping me company, over to Matthew. Chuka Umunna has called on Matt Hancock to resign, citing Hancock\u2019s former absolute disdain for proroguing. Which includes him saying that suspending parliament went against \u201ceverything that those men who waded onto those beaches fought and died for\u201d. Thanks to all the readers who have sent these in. Keep them coming! Feel free to tweet yourself and tag me (@MsKateLyons) and I\u2019ll embed your tweet. Otherwise, DM me. Read this terrific reminder of some of the things that Tory ministers once said about calls to prorogue parliament, including Matt Hancock, who once said that suspending parliament would disrespect war dead, Amber Rudd, who branded it a \u201cridiculous suggestion\u201d and Sajid Javid, who said \u201cyou don\u2019t deliver democracy by trashing democracy\u201d. Some international front pages. If you\u2019re outside the UK and proroguing news has made it onto your front page, tweet me a picture and I\u2019ll embed in the blog. ABC in Spain says Johnson has \u201cput the Queen into the Brexit war\u201d and Liberation in France says we are seeing a harder and harder Brexit. De Standaard reports: \u201cJohnson puts everything at stake for hard Brexit\u201d. Several in Belgium call the day\u2019s events a \u201ccoup\u201d, including De Morgen, which labels the event a \u201cvery British coup\u201d. What the papers said There is plenty of constitutional outcry on the front pages of the British papers today, which all lead with Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament ahead of the looming Brexit deadline. Front pages from abroad show the international press is transfixed too. The news has reached Courtney Love, who is devastated. A petition calling for parliament not to be prorogued has now reached more than 1.1m signatures, perhaps you know this, perhaps you\u2019ve signed it. Any petition that receives more than 100,000 signatures is automatically qualified to be debated by parliament, which feels a little ironic in the situation. If you\u2019d like to see where in the country people are most angry about this issue (or at least most willing to click on a petition), you can see it here at this handy map. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the day\u2019s political news. It was not a nightmare, you did not dream it, yesterday Boris Johnson\u2019s government sought and received approval from the Queen to prorogue parliament for five weeks from mid-September. The prime minister claimed there would be \u201cample time\u201d to debate Brexit, but as we know, not everyone shares this view. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, issued a furious statement from his holiday, saying he had not been consulted by the prime minister, and that \u201cthe move represents a constitutional outrage\u201d. \u201cHowever it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country,\u201d he said. There were protests around the country yesterday and a petition calling for parliament not to be prorogued has now reached more than 1.1m signatures. Eyes are on Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, who is expected to quit the party over differences with Johnson. I\u2019ll be shepherding us along for the first hour or so before handing the blog over to my esteemed colleague Matthew Weaver. Please do get in touch on Twitter or via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). We\u2019re not opening comments right now, but will do so later on. Who knows what the day will hold, except that we\u2019ll all be saying the word \u201cproroguing\u201d far more than we ever would have dreamed. Let\u2019s go!",

However, that option has been fatally undermined by the decision to prorogue parliament for far longer than normal. I will therefore support any legislative action that is possible next week as it is quite likely that it could be parliament\u2019s only chance to impact on how we leave the EU.\u201d</p> \n<p>James, who resigned shortly before the summer recess, said the prorogation, coupled with the resignation of George Young, a government whip in the Lords, had been a tipping point for her. Lord Young resigned earlier on Thursday, saying he was \u201cvery unhappy at the timing and length of the prorogation and its motivation\u201d.</p> \n<p>James said: \u201cFor him to have no place in the government demonstrates with deeply depressing clarity just what a minority government this has become, its only mandate a vote from around 90,000 members of the Conservative party, a third of which joined since the referendum, and who are not representative of the country as a whole.\u201d</p> \n<p>Richard Harrington, the former business minister who quit in March to support efforts to stop no deal, confirmed he would vote with Tory rebels next week. He announced on Thursday that he would step down as an MP at the next election, saying he was retiring rather than quitting in protest at Brexit. He said he believed he needed to make his intentions clear due to the possibility of a snap election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d50300cf-2636-4c44-ad3d-e8751ea2816a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DksT1UDzTtY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jonathan Djanogly, one of the MPs who had backed Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal as well as efforts to stop no deal, said he was angered by the lack of opportunity for scrutiny of Johnson\u2019s plans. \u201cLegalities of shutting down parliament apart, no deal has no democratic backing, so stopping debate on the issue is morally wrong in my book,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if you support a no-deal Brexit, surely you would want government no-deal preparations to be scrutinised. For instance, my own Brexit select committee will not be allowed to sit to question ministers on the adequacy of Project Yellowhammer [the preparations for no deal]. This is a big mistake.\u201d</p> \n<p>Guto Bebb, one of the handful of Conservatives who has backed the People\u2019s Vote campaign, said: <strong>\u201c</strong>As Conservatives we prize loyalty. But it has become increasingly clear that our loyalty must be to our party\u2019s long-term values and not to the man who leads the party at this time.</p> \n<p>\u201cI will be using my vote in parliament next week to do that. I know many of my Conservative colleagues, many of whom have never before defied the official whip of the party leadership, will be doing the same.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ministers privately admit the battle to block anti-no-deal legislation in the Commons next week appears all but lost, but efforts to frustrate the rebels are focusing on the House of Lords.</p> \n<p>Opposition peers expect Tories in the Lords to attempt to filibuster the legislation, which will need to have passed through all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent before parliament is suspended or it will fall.</p> \n<p>The Liberal Democrats\u2019 leader in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the government could be defeated. \u201cThe government\u2019s tactic to stop the bill in the Lords could be to pack it with hostile amendments and then attempt to filibuster the bill. On our side we can interrupt and put the amendments to a vote and, depending on how many there are, we could even sit all night every day through Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We have the troops and we have the camp beds. People will be queuing up to stay.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lord Newby added: \u201cWe believe that parliament cannot be prorogued as long as the majority in the House of Lords keep the debate going.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the Commons, several other no-deal sceptic Tories said they still wanted to give Johnson time to get a deal before they were prepared to vote against him. Victoria Prentis, one of the key backers of Rory Stewart\u2019s leadership campaign, said: \u201cI am still likely to give him [Johnson] the benefit of the doubt next week. He has promised that he will get a deal; I want to give him the time to get a deal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some said they believed they would still have time to act before no deal, even in October. Gillian Keegan said: \u201cI am very much against no deal but I also very much want to vote for a deal. We are in uncharted territory but I do believe we have time, even in the last week of October, to find a way to stop no deal if it really looks like that is where we are headed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Others who have said they will continue to back the prime minister include Nicholas Soames, Richard Benyon and Tobias Ellwood, all of whom have spoken out against no deal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"68be1ef3-115e-4304-bfc4-441cb3896047\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hp3ZMkLmFf4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Labour said it intended to play a central role in any legislative fightback. Corbyn told Sky News: \u201cWe will be back in parliament on Tuesday to challenge Boris Johnson on what I think is a smash-and-grab raid against our democracy. He\u2019s trying to suspend parliament in order to prevent a serious discussion and a serious debate to prevent a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is try to politically stop him on Tuesday with a parliamentary process in order to legislate to prevent a no-deal Brexit and also to try to prevent him shutting down parliament during this utterly crucial period.\u201d</p> \n<p>Corbyn said he was confident there was enough time in parliament to introduce legislation. \u201cWe believe we can do it, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be trying to do it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Labour later released a joint statement with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group for Change and the Green party, saying: \u201cIt is our view that there is a majority in the House of Commons that does not support this prorogation, and we demand that the prime minister reverses this decision immediately or allows MPs to vote on whether there should be one.\u201d</p>",

Jonathan Djanogly, one of the MPs who had backed Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal as well as efforts to stop no deal, said he was angered by the lack of opportunity for scrutiny of Johnson\u2019s plans. \u201cLegalities of shutting down parliament apart, no deal has no democratic backing, so stopping debate on the issue is morally wrong in my book,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you support a no-deal Brexit, surely you would want government no-deal preparations to be scrutinised. For instance, my own Brexit select committee will not be allowed to sit to question ministers on the adequacy of Project Yellowhammer [the preparations for no deal]. This is a big mistake.\u201d Guto Bebb, one of the handful of Conservatives who has backed the People\u2019s Vote campaign, said: \u201cAs Conservatives we prize loyalty. But it has become increasingly clear that our loyalty must be to our party\u2019s long-term values and not to the man who leads the party at this time. \u201cI will be using my vote in parliament next week to do that. I know many of my Conservative colleagues, many of whom have never before defied the official whip of the party leadership, will be doing the same.\u201d Ministers privately admit the battle to block anti-no-deal legislation in the Commons next week appears all but lost, but efforts to frustrate the rebels are focusing on the House of Lords. Opposition peers expect Tories in the Lords to attempt to filibuster the legislation, which will need to have passed through all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent before parliament is suspended or it will fall. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 leader in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the government could be defeated. \u201cThe government\u2019s tactic to stop the bill in the Lords could be to pack it with hostile amendments and then attempt to filibuster the bill. On our side we can interrupt and put the amendments to a vote and, depending on how many there are, we could even sit all night every day through Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We have the troops and we have the camp beds. People will be queuing up to stay.\u201d Lord Newby added: \u201cWe believe that parliament cannot be prorogued as long as the majority in the House of Lords keep the debate going.\u201d In the Commons, several other no-deal sceptic Tories said they still wanted to give Johnson time to get a deal before they were prepared to vote against him. Victoria Prentis, one of the key backers of Rory Stewart\u2019s leadership campaign, said: \u201cI am still likely to give him [Johnson] the benefit of the doubt next week. He has promised that he will get a deal; I want to give him the time to get a deal.\u201d Some said they believed they would still have time to act before no deal, even in October. Gillian Keegan said: \u201cI am very much against no deal but I also very much want to vote for a deal. We are in uncharted territory but I do believe we have time, even in the last week of October, to find a way to stop no deal if it really looks like that is where we are headed.\u201d Others who have said they will continue to back the prime minister include Nicholas Soames, Richard Benyon and Tobias Ellwood, all of whom have spoken out against no deal. Labour said it intended to play a central role in any legislative fightback. Corbyn told Sky News: \u201cWe will be back in parliament on Tuesday to challenge Boris Johnson on what I think is a smash-and-grab raid against our democracy. He\u2019s trying to suspend parliament in order to prevent a serious discussion and a serious debate to prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is try to politically stop him on Tuesday with a parliamentary process in order to legislate to prevent a no-deal Brexit and also to try to prevent him shutting down parliament during this utterly crucial period.\u201d Corbyn said he was confident there was enough time in parliament to introduce legislation. \u201cWe believe we can do it, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be trying to do it,\u201d he said. Labour later released a joint statement with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group for Change and the Green party, saying: \u201cIt is our view that there is a majority in the House of Commons that does not support this prorogation, and we demand that the prime minister reverses this decision immediately or allows MPs to vote on whether there should be one.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Luxury food foie gras could be struck off the menu in New York if proposed legislation to ban the sale of the controversial French delicacy goes ahead. New York City council is considering outlawing the product \u2013 which derives from duck or goose and translates as \u201cfatty liver\u201d \u2013 which is a staple at many of its top restaurants. Critics of foie gras say the process is cruel because ducks and geese are overfed through a pipe which can expand the liver up to 10 times its normal size. The proposed bill, which could be voted on in months, would ban the sale of foie gras made from birds that have been force fed and establishments from serving it. Carlina Rivera, the council member who introduced the bill, said the production process is \u201cegregiously cruel\u201d. She added: \u201cNot only does force feeding cause extreme pain and suffering, it is all being done for a luxury product that only a tiny percentage of New York City restaurants serve and is not part of the diet of hardworking New Yorkers.\u201d If it passes, anyone violating the law could be liable to a $1,000 fine, up to a year in jail or both. So far, it has attracted the support of mayor Bill de Blasio and over half the council as co-sponsors. But not everybody is so enthusiastic. Marcus Henley, manager of Hudson Valley Foie Gras in Ferndale, New York, one of three foie gras farms in the country and one of two in the state, said the basis for the ban is wrong. The foie gras farming process, he claims, is \u201cverifiably not harmful to animals\u201d. While a ban would not prevent the farm from rearing ducks for foie gras, it would stop them from selling to New York City, their largest market, and he said it would probably put them out of business. \u201cThis law would potentially devastate a rural, relatively poor community where there are 400 workers that are employed directly and hundreds more indirectly by the foie gras farming companies in upstate New York,\u201d he said. Among the New York restaurants that serve foie gras is Michelin-starred French restaurant Le Coucou, whose dishes include foie gras with fresh cherries, almonds and girolle mushrooms. Chef and partner Daniel Rose said although he is in favor of stricter guidelines for overall food production, more consideration is needed before issuing an outright ban on a single product. He said he would like to see the introduction a series of \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d ethical guidelines for food production. \u201cCan we say that feeding kids high fructose corn syrup causes \u2018less suffering\u2019 than the production of foie gras?\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t think we have asked all of the meaningful questions and considered enough opinions to start banning individual food items without core principals and processes guiding our decisions \u2026 If banning foie gras in New York generates a conversation about the state of food in America and the treatment of animals in general then I\u2019m all for it.\u201d If New York introduces a ban it will put the city alongside California, which has a state-wide ban on the production and sale of foie gras. Chicago passed a ban in 2006, but it was overturned two years later. Whole Foods banned its sale in 1997 and Postmates ended deliveries of it last year. Outside the US, Britain, Israel and India all have bans on sale or production. Gene Baur, vegan activist and author and president of Farm Sanctuary, hopes New York and California can help spur a world-wide movement. \u201cThose are two very important markets that will hopefully set a tone for other states and cities and ideally even influence what happens around the world,\u201d he said.",

Mings got his big break there in 2012, when Ipswich invited him to drive his Citro\u00ebn Saxo to Suffolk for a trial, but before that he played for Yate Town, another non-league club in the south-west, and had also been part of Southampton\u2019s academy, only to be released at the age of 16.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/england-squad-gareth-southgate-tyrone-mings-euro-2020-qualifiers\">Mings, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wan-Bissaka get England call-ups</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rejection was in danger of becoming something a theme in those days. At one stage \u2013 and he would later laugh about this with Adie, his father \u2013 Mings was turned down for a job in his local One Stop corner shop because of his lack of experience.</p> \n<p>He had more success pulling pints in the White Hart near Chippenham and applying to work as a mortgage adviser with London &amp; Country\u2019s Bath Office, where he was earning \u00a315,000 a year to go with the \u00a345 a week he was picking up in the non\u2011league game.</p> \n<p>With all of that in mind, it is easy to see why Mings talked about it being \u201ca long journey to get to this point\u201d when he pulled up a chair at Villa\u2019s training ground, with a big grin on his face and his eyes sparkling, and reflected on the news he had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/england-squad-gareth-southgate-tyrone-mings-euro-2020-qualifiers\" title=\"\">called up to the England squad</a> for the first time.</p> \n<p>The 26-year-old thought it was a prank. \u201cI got a text when I came in from training from the England player liaison officer, Emily. I texted back saying: \u2018Oh shit.\u2019 Excuse my language. She then called me and said: \u2018I\u2019m not joking.\u2019 It was only when I spoke to her, I knew she was being serious.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mings has been on England\u2019s radar for a while.

      "bodyText": "Last Saturday afternoon, less than 24 hours after helping Aston Villa beat Everton in front of Gareth Southgate, a live television audience and more than 41,000 spectators, Tyrone Mings was back where it all started, at Hardenhuish Park, in Wiltshire, watching Chippenham face Weymouth in the National League south among 768 others. To say Chippenham is where it all started is not quite true. Mings got his big break there in 2012, when Ipswich invited him to drive his Citro\u00ebn Saxo to Suffolk for a trial, but before that he played for Yate Town, another non-league club in the south-west, and had also been part of Southampton\u2019s academy, only to be released at the age of 16. Rejection was in danger of becoming something a theme in those days. At one stage \u2013 and he would later laugh about this with Adie, his father \u2013 Mings was turned down for a job in his local One Stop corner shop because of his lack of experience. He had more success pulling pints in the White Hart near Chippenham and applying to work as a mortgage adviser with London &amp; Country\u2019s Bath Office, where he was earning \u00a315,000 a year to go with the \u00a345 a week he was picking up in the non\u2011league game. With all of that in mind, it is easy to see why Mings talked about it being \u201ca long journey to get to this point\u201d when he pulled up a chair at Villa\u2019s training ground, with a big grin on his face and his eyes sparkling, and reflected on the news he had been called up to the England squad for the first time. The 26-year-old thought it was a prank. \u201cI got a text when I came in from training from the England player liaison officer, Emily. I texted back saying: \u2018Oh shit.\u2019 Excuse my language. She then called me and said: \u2018I\u2019m not joking.\u2019 It was only when I spoke to her, I knew she was being serious.\u201d Mings has been on England\u2019s radar for a while. Southgate watched him last season in a 2-1 victory over Blackburn in March, when Jack Grealish and Tammy Abraham were also in his thoughts, and the England manager or his assistant, Steve Holland, have seen Villa\u2019s three Premier League games this season, during which Mings has been hugely impressive. Tall, quick, combative and comfortable on the ball, he ticks a lot of boxes for a central defender, especially as he is left-footed. Even so, England recognition represents a remarkable turnaround for a player who made 10 Premier League starts for Bournemouth after joining from Ipswich in 2015. Injuries played their part in that statistic \u2013 Mings snapped his cruciate ligament six minutes into his first appearance for the club and, much to his annoyance, later spent seven months on the sidelines with a back problem he felt should have been resolved within seven weeks. Yet aside from those long and lonely months trying to get back \u2013 Mings ended up working with a psychologist as well as the club\u2019s medical staff because of how low he felt \u2013 there is no getting away from the fact there were also plenty of occasions when he was fit and desperate to play at Bournemouth but not deemed good enough to be in the team. Disillusioned and frustrated, Mings pushed hard to go out on loan in January and his wish was granted on deadline day, when he signed for Villa following negotiations between the clubs that were far from straightforward. Over the course of the next four months, which culminated in promotion to the Premier League via the play\u2011offs, Mings was a revelation. A natural leader, he quickly formed a close relationship with Villa\u2019s assistant head coach, John Terry, who knows a thing or two about playing at centre-back and would stress to Mings how important it was for a player in that position \u201cto go through the game without being seen\u201d. Mings, though, was being noticed for all the right reasons. Although a few eyebrows were raised this summer when it was announced Villa had signed Mings permanently for a fee that could rise to as much as \u00a326.5m, it is already looking like money well spent. Three games into the season and the West Country boy who has never forgotten his roots is on his way to St George\u2019s Park.",

The biggest party, Fretilin, unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975. Indonesia, which was already carrying out secret attacks across the border from West Timor, invaded nine days later.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Why were the East Timorese so opposed to Indonesian rule?</b></p>\n    <p>Portugal\u2019s colonial influence meant the population was culturally very different from the rest of Indonesia. The vast majority of East Timorese are devout Catholics and speak their own language (Tetun).</p>\n    <p><b>What happened after the invasion?</b></p>\n    <p>The world largely looked the other way and some 200,000 people died over the next 24 years of Indonesian occupation. In July 1976 Indonesia\u2019s parliament declared East Timor the country\u2019s 27th province.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>What happened to the Timorese resistance?</b></p>\n    <p>The armed resistance was decimated and, in 1992, its leader, Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, was captured and imprisoned in Jakarta. Exiled leaders, like Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, kept up the fight. In 1996 Ramos-Horta shared the Nobel peace prize with the head of the Catholic church in East Timor, Bishop Carlos Belo. But the brutal occupation continued.</p>\n    <p><b>Why did Indonesia change its stance towards East Timor?</b></p>\n    <p>In 1998 Indonesia's President Suharto, in power for 30 years, resigned amid the Asian financial crisis and massive pro-democracy protests in Jakarta. His successor, BJ Habibie, was more open to some form of autonomy for East Timor. In March 1999 he announced that if the East Timorese favoured independence over autonomy under Indonesia, he would grant it.</p>\n    <p><b>What happened in the referendum and its aftermath?</b></p>\n    <p>On 30 August 1999 the UN oversaw an historic ballot, in which 78.5% of East Timorese rejected autonomy in favour of independence. Indonesian-backed militia groups who had terrorised the population before the vote stepped up their attacks, aided by Indonesian security forces. A three-week campaign of violence killed 2,600 people, nearly 30,000 were displaced and as many as 250,000 <a href=\"https://www.etan.org/etanpdf/2006/CAVR/Chega!-Report-Executive-Summary.pdf\">were forcibly shipped over the border to Indonesian West Timor</a>, in what amounted to a scorched-earth policy.</p>\n    <p><b>How did the world respond?</b></p>\n    <p>On 20 September 1999 an Australian-led international peacekeeping force, Interfet, arrived to restore order. Gusm\u00e3o and other exiled leaders returned. Elections in 2002 saw him become newly named Timor Leste's first president</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On 1 August 1999, the Sunday Age reported the Australian government had ordered senior strategists to reject a US invitation to discuss sending peacekeeping forces to the region before or after the 30 August referendum.

Two days later the US embassy in Canberra sent a \u201csensitive but unclassified\u201d message to the secretary of state and joint military and state department staff, noting the three days of media reports. \u201cDfat maritime Southeast Asia assistant secretary Neil Mules told [US embassy officer] on Aug 2 that these stories infuriated FM Downer, coming as they did at the end of what he considered to be a highly successful visit to East Timor and Jakarta,\u201d it said. It noted Downer\u2019s strong denials, and said he had \u201cordered Dfat to send to the Australian embassy in Washington, for transmission to the department, press points he is using to rebut the articles\u201d. \u201cMules urged that, in responding to press queries about these stories, US [government] spokesmen make similar points.\u201d The news reports included a description of a meeting between then head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat), Ashton Calvert, and the US assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, Stanley Roth, where the pair disagreed on when international forces should be sent. Roth believed it should be sooner rather than later. Roth was a key proponent of the need for an international presence in East Timor, arguing it would descend into violence without one. The hundreds of documents released on Friday show his repeated efforts to lobby General Wiranto, the then head of Indonesia\u2019s armed forces, to allow a presence, but without the backing of the Pentagon Roth was refused. Clinton Fernandes, a professor of international and political studies at the University of New South Wales, said if Roth had the support of Australia he could have \u201cgone to the Pentagon and asked for a rethink\u201d. \u201cWhat strikes out to me is that in all the hundreds of cables [released on Friday] you don\u2019t see anything from the US government to say \u2018we are getting pressure from the Australians to help the Timorese\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the telling thing. \u201cThere is no sense they\u2019re getting any pressure from Australia to help the Timorese, they\u2019re only getting pressure about pushing back against the leaks.\u201d The cable released on Friday said the US embassy officer agreed with Mules the stories were \u201cludicrous\u201d and that US-Australian coordination had been \u201cgood\u201d. Mules said Dfat believed the Roth-Calvert conversation referred to might have been one in February, \u201cin circumstances which bear no resemblance to those which pertain today\u201d. He suggested the \u201cmischievous\u201d leaks had come from Labor and were given to journalists who favoured a peacekeeping operation. On 10 August 1999, the then opposition spokesman for foreign affairs, Laurie Brereton, told the ABC Australia was \u201cthe reason that peacekeepers are not there now\u201d. Australia\u2019s pushback on international intervention at the time has been widely criticised, particularly in the years after East Timor\u2019s independence. A note added by the US scribe to the Mules-Downer cable described one of the reporters as \u201ca long time East Timor activist\u201d who wanted to embarrass Australia over its \u201ccraven\u201d handling of East Timor. The government has been repeatedly accused of protecting its relationship with Indonesia \u2013 and its interests in oil and gas reserves \u2013 over standing up for East Timor. Australia eventually contributed personnel to a UN mission to supervise the independence referendum, and led a UN peacekeeping force after the vote. The post-vote force was allowed in only after US military pressure was applied to Indonesia, the tranche of declassified cables revealed on Thursday. The documents were released in a briefing book by the National Security Archive\u2019s researcher Brad Simpson to coincide with the 20th anniversary of East Timor\u2019s independence referendum on 30 August. They revealed the US had widespread and evidenced knowledge of the Indonesian military\u2019s support for the militias months before the vote. Downer has been approached for comment.",

The annual employee census, which gathered information from almost 10,000 workers in the mega department, has ranked the Department of Home Affairs as the worst agency for staff engagement across the Australian public service. Across all 97 APS agencies that were surveyed, the department ranked last for engagement, 94 for wellbeing and 91 for innovation. Only about half of home affairs employees believe their direct executive managers are of high quality, which while a slight improvement compared to 2018, remains 13% lower than the public service overall. Workers are scathing of the senior leadership across the agency as a whole, with 40% saying their senior executives are not \u201cseen in action\u201d and only 35% judging them to be of high quality. The snapshot of unhappiness pervading the department is translating to people wanting to leave, with almost 40% of people surveyed \u2013 about 3,500 people \u2013 admitting they had applied for a job outside the department in the past 12 months and 36% of respondents wanting to leave the department in the next 12 months. Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, said the report card \u201clays bare Peter Dutton\u2019s incompetence, failure to lead his department and inability to adequately support staff at the frontline of serving and protecting Australia\u2019s borders and national security\u201d. \u201cIt is clear the climate of harassment, bullying, poor communication, substandard leadership and lacking resources is pervasive in Peter Dutton\u2019s department \u2013 the department that is charged with keeping Australia safe, while also welcoming new migrants and visitors to our country,\u201d Keneally said. \u201cIt is clear that this poisonous culture is resulting in poor outcomes, with blowouts in bridging visas, airplane arrivals claiming asylum and people waiting to pledge citizenship to Australia all spiralling out of control all because of Mr Dutton\u2019s incompetence.\u201d Keneally said that if the results were replicated in the private sector, a chairman or chief executive would \u201chang their heads in shame\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The survey also found that only 71% of staff believed the agency \u201cactively encourages ethical behaviour by all of its employees\u201d. Almost 20% also reported they had experienced discrimination on the basis of background or personal characteristic, more than in other agencies, with gender, age and caring responsibilities listed as the three highest responses. Bullying and harassment is also more prevalent in the department compared to other areas of the public service, with 17% reporting harassment and bullying, 55% of which was verbal abuse, including \u201coffensive language, derogatory remarks, shouting and screaming\u201d, and 44% listed as interference, including sabotage. About 5% of people claim to have witnessed corruption, predominantly cronyism, acting with a conflict of interest or nepotism. In questions relating directly to the function of the Department of Home Affairs, about 25% of people did not support the statement that they understood \u201cthe purpose of the Home Affairs Portfolio\u201d, while less than half said the agency engaged sufficiently \u201cso that I understand our direction\u201d. Dutton\u2019s office did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment on the survey findings.",

      "bodyText": "The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has reassured the Indonesian government that he supports deeper trade ties with Jakarta, as the party comes under growing union pressure to oppose a new free-trade agreement that the government wants passed through parliament this year. A parliamentary committee is scrutinising the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Partnership, which has been in negotiation between the two countries for more than six years, and which the government wants ratified by the end of the year. But Labor and the unions remain concerned about several aspects of the deal, including provisions that allow the use of temporary foreign labour without domestic market testing and dispute-settlement provisions for foreign investors. Unions gave evidence to the joint standing committee on treaties (JSCOT) this week, saying they opposed key elements of the deal, and warning that temporary labour provisions could undermine Australian working conditions. \u201cFree trade agreements that deal with the movement of temporary overseas workers into Australia are critical issues for Australian unions and members,\u201d the Australian Council of Trade Union\u2019s Damian Kyloh said. \u201cQuite simply, this is because the fundamental issues at stake are about support for Australian jobs, support for Australian training opportunities and support for fair treatment and decent wages and conditions for all workers.\u201d The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, called on Labor to stare down the unions, saying their opposition to the new economic partnership was a \u201cbaseless scare campaign\u201d. \u201cThe unions have shown that once again they have blinkered opposition to trade agreements and ignore both the reality that Australian exports and jobs have grown since we expanded our network of trade agreements in recent years, and ignore the text and details within the draft agreement which has been struck,\u201d Birmingham said. \u201cI would urge the Labor party to listen to the farmers and businesses who want to sell more goods in a market like Indonesia and not stand in the way.\u201d Birmingham said he hoped the Coalition would not be forced to negotiate with the Senate crossbench to pass the legislation to ratify the agreement, which could be introduced as early as October following the JSCOT inquiry. \u201cThe significance of the Australia Indonesia relationship is meant to be bipartisan, it was meant to be underscored by Anthony Albanese\u2019s visit to Indonesia this week and it would be a betrayal of the bipartisan commitment to the relationship were Labor not to support this agreement.\u201d Labor had pledged to renegotiate the agreement had it won government, and is holding out supporting the deal until after the agreement has gone through parliament\u2019s JSCOT. Labor\u2019s position on the deal was raised in Jakarta this week, where Albanese and the shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, met with Indonesia\u2019s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, and trade officials. Following the meeting, Albanese said the economic relationship between Australia and Indonesia was \u201cvital\u201d. \u201cAt a time whereby we\u2019re seeing the implications of trade conflict on the global stage, it\u2019s important that we have a rules-based order, it\u2019s important that we have agreements between countries in our region that promote trade. \u201cAustralia is a trading nation. This isn\u2019t just about trade of course, it\u2019s an economic partnership and there are already agreements in place between Australia and Indonesia that this will replace.\u201d However, Albanese is declining to endorse the agreement, telling Guardian Australia that the party is still consulting externally and he does not want to preempt the decision of caucus. \u201cThe Indonesia free trade agreement is going through a parliamentary process, including hearings by Parliament\u2019s treaties committee. \u201cWe are consulting with many stakeholders and Federal Labor Caucus members, and we\u2019ll listen to any concerns.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Labor MP Josh Wilson, who sits on the JSCOT committee, said he was concerned about proposed investor state settlement clauses and the ability for temporary foreign workers to be accessed without proper labour market testing. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case it goes against a fundamental principle of our system, and will further weaken wages and job opportunities in this country,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt is sneaky and wrong to pursue the unraveling of core workforce protections through trade arrangements.\u201d Wilson also said that it would be \u201cbananas\u201d if proposed new investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses did not replace old clauses, warning they would \u201cremain active and available to multinational companies that might want to sue Australia over health or environmental or workplace regulations that don\u2019t suit their interests\u201d. Labor\u2019s position on free trade agreements has hardened after it supported the so-called TPP-11, which was signed after the collapse of negotiations for the US-backed Trans Pacific Partnership, with the party adopting a more hardline position at its national conference requiring independent assessment of the benefits of trade deals and the outlawing of ISDS clauses. Last week, Labor\u2019s shadow trade minister, Madeleine King, appeared to back the deal, using a conference in her home state of Western Australia to argue the benefits of new free-trade deals as demand from China waned. \u201cBalancing trade relationships and diversifying trading partnerships will be integral to this, as such supporting upcoming Free Trade Agreements and regional economic partnerships \u2013 such as the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Partnership \u2013 will be of paramount importance to the state.\u201d Advocates of the deal, including business and agricultural groups, say the trade deal will be worth about $35bn to the two countries\u2019 economies and have urged it to be ratified.",

Society, sexuality and the search for the 'gay gene'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the first part of the study, they looked at data from about 500,000 individuals collected as part of the UK Biobank project: about 4% of men and nearly 3% of women said they had ever had a same-sex sexual experience. The team stress that they did not focus on identity or orientation, and did not include transgender individuals.</p> <p>By looking at sexual behaviour and relatedness of individuals, they estimated that about a third of the variation in same-sex behaviour is explained by genetics. That, they say, chimes with previous twin studies that put the figure at about 30% to 50%.</p> <p>Dr Brendan Zietsch, co-author of the research from the University of Queensland in Australia, said that does not mean the rest is due to upbringing or culture. \u201cFor example, it is thought that non-genetic factors before birth, such as the hormonal environment in the womb, also play an important role,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>The team then looked at which genetic variants might be behind the link, using data from more than 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank project and more than 68,000 individuals whose data was collected by the company 23andMe.</p> <p>Researchers found five genetic variants \u2013 tiny differences in DNA \u2013 that showed a clear link to same-sex sexual behaviour, two in both men and women, two found only in men and one found only in women. The team believe one, found only in men, might be involved in sex hormone regulation, not least because it is linked to male-pattern balding.</p> <p>Even taken together, though, these five genetic variants explain less than 1% of the variation in same-sex behaviour among participants \u2013 suggesting many other variants are involved, each playing a very small role.</p> <p>Neale stressed that the scale of the influence of non-genetic factors, complexities of sexual behaviour, and difficulties in precisely measuring the size of any variant\u2019s effects, means it is not possible to use genetic information to predict whether an individual will have same-sex partners.</p> <p>The study provides a number of insights, including that there is overlap between genetic predisposition to same-sex sexual behaviour and traits such as openness to experience, as well as predisposition to mental health problems.</p> <p>\u201cOne possibility is that stigma associated with same-sex sexual behaviour causes or exacerbates mental health issues. This could create a genetic correlation,\u201d said Zeitsch.</p> <p>The authors also say their findings call into question the idea that sexuality exists on a single scale.</p> <p>\u201c[There] seem to be genes associated with opposite-sex attraction and other genes associated with same-sex attraction, and these are not related,\u201d added Zeitsch. \u201cThese results suggest we shouldn\u2019t be measuring sexual preference on a single continuum from straight to gay, but rather two separate dimensions: attraction to the same sex and attraction to the opposite sex.\u201d</p> <p>However, the study has limitations including that it is based mainly on people of European ancestry, while the age range of participants does not fully reflect that of the wider population. It also relied on self-reported behaviour.</p> <p>The idea that genetics might play a role in same-sex attraction was propelled into the spotlight in 1993 when Dean Hamer, a scientist at the US National Cancer Institute, and his team <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8332896\">found links</a> between DNA markers on the X chromosome and male sexual orientation.</p> <p>The findings caused considerable controversy, with the media dubbing the discovery the \u201cgay gene\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/jul/24/gay-genes-science-is-on-the-right-track-were-born-this-way-lets-deal-with-it\">'Gay genes': science is on the right track, we're born this way. Let\u2019s deal with it.</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Subsequent research has thrown up mixed results, although recent studies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/14/genes-influence-male-sexual-orientation-study\">have supported</a> the theory that genetics plays a role in sexual orientation.</p> <p>Hamer said he was delighted by the latest research. \u201cThis provides yet another strand of evidence, another approach, showing that there is a strong and significant genetic contribution to people\u2019s sexual behaviour,\u201d he said. </p> <p>However, unlike Hamer\u2019s work, the latest study does not show any special importance of the X chromosome. The researchers say that is not surprising, adding the previous findings would not meet today\u2019s bar for importance, and were based on a small sample size.</p> <p>Hamer said he was not surprised either \u2013 although he put it down to the latest study looking at same-sex behaviour rather than sexual orientation. </p> <p>Qazi Rahman, a leading authority on sexual orientation research from King\u2019s College London, welcomed the study but said that the databases involved only captured information from a small percentage of people who were invited to participate. That, he said, means that the genetic variants found in the latest research might reflect another trait particular to those who chose to respond.</p> <p>Rahman added he was not surprised that the genetic variants identified only have small individual effects, pointing out that since same-sex behaviour is linked to having to fewer offspring, evolution is likely to hide such variants in effect.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://geneticsexbehavior.info/\">website</a> set up by the researchers to explain the study gives a clear message: \u201cThis study provides further evidence that diverse sexual behaviour is a natural part of overall human variation.\u201d</p> <p>Rahman agreed, stressing that the findings do not change the fact that everyone should be treated with respect. \u201cThe causes of a trait shouldn\u2019t influence how we see it,\u201d he said.</p>",

Writing in the journal Science, an international team of researchers report how they drew on existing genetic databases to conduct the largest study yet into genetics and same-sex sexual behaviour. In the first part of the study, they looked at data from about 500,000 individuals collected as part of the UK Biobank project: about 4% of men and nearly 3% of women said they had ever had a same-sex sexual experience. The team stress that they did not focus on identity or orientation, and did not include transgender individuals. By looking at sexual behaviour and relatedness of individuals, they estimated that about a third of the variation in same-sex behaviour is explained by genetics. That, they say, chimes with previous twin studies that put the figure at about 30% to 50%. Dr Brendan Zietsch, co-author of the research from the University of Queensland in Australia, said that does not mean the rest is due to upbringing or culture. \u201cFor example, it is thought that non-genetic factors before birth, such as the hormonal environment in the womb, also play an important role,\u201d he told the Guardian. The team then looked at which genetic variants might be behind the link, using data from more than 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank project and more than 68,000 individuals whose data was collected by the company 23andMe. Researchers found five genetic variants \u2013 tiny differences in DNA \u2013 that showed a clear link to same-sex sexual behaviour, two in both men and women, two found only in men and one found only in women. The team believe one, found only in men, might be involved in sex hormone regulation, not least because it is linked to male-pattern balding. Even taken together, though, these five genetic variants explain less than 1% of the variation in same-sex behaviour among participants \u2013 suggesting many other variants are involved, each playing a very small role. Neale stressed that the scale of the influence of non-genetic factors, complexities of sexual behaviour, and difficulties in precisely measuring the size of any variant\u2019s effects, means it is not possible to use genetic information to predict whether an individual will have same-sex partners. The study provides a number of insights, including that there is overlap between genetic predisposition to same-sex sexual behaviour and traits such as openness to experience, as well as predisposition to mental health problems. \u201cOne possibility is that stigma associated with same-sex sexual behaviour causes or exacerbates mental health issues. This could create a genetic correlation,\u201d said Zeitsch. The authors also say their findings call into question the idea that sexuality exists on a single scale. \u201c[There] seem to be genes associated with opposite-sex attraction and other genes associated with same-sex attraction, and these are not related,\u201d added Zeitsch. \u201cThese results suggest we shouldn\u2019t be measuring sexual preference on a single continuum from straight to gay, but rather two separate dimensions: attraction to the same sex and attraction to the opposite sex.\u201d However, the study has limitations including that it is based mainly on people of European ancestry, while the age range of participants does not fully reflect that of the wider population. It also relied on self-reported behaviour. The idea that genetics might play a role in same-sex attraction was propelled into the spotlight in 1993 when Dean Hamer, a scientist at the US National Cancer Institute, and his team found links between DNA markers on the X chromosome and male sexual orientation. The findings caused considerable controversy, with the media dubbing the discovery the \u201cgay gene\u201d. Subsequent research has thrown up mixed results, although recent studies have supported the theory that genetics plays a role in sexual orientation. Hamer said he was delighted by the latest research. \u201cThis provides yet another strand of evidence, another approach, showing that there is a strong and significant genetic contribution to people\u2019s sexual behaviour,\u201d he said. However, unlike Hamer\u2019s work, the latest study does not show any special importance of the X chromosome. The researchers say that is not surprising, adding the previous findings would not meet today\u2019s bar for importance, and were based on a small sample size. Hamer said he was not surprised either \u2013 although he put it down to the latest study looking at same-sex behaviour rather than sexual orientation. Qazi Rahman, a leading authority on sexual orientation research from King\u2019s College London, welcomed the study but said that the databases involved only captured information from a small percentage of people who were invited to participate. That, he said, means that the genetic variants found in the latest research might reflect another trait particular to those who chose to respond. Rahman added he was not surprised that the genetic variants identified only have small individual effects, pointing out that since same-sex behaviour is linked to having to fewer offspring, evolution is likely to hide such variants in effect. A website set up by the researchers to explain the study gives a clear message: \u201cThis study provides further evidence that diverse sexual behaviour is a natural part of overall human variation.\u201d Rahman agreed, stressing that the findings do not change the fact that everyone should be treated with respect. \u201cThe causes of a trait shouldn\u2019t influence how we see it,\u201d he said.",

Blazes have been seen on the Ararib\u00f3ia indigenous reserve in Maranh\u00e3o state \u2013 a heavily deforested reserve on the Amazon\u2019s eastern fringes, which is home to about 80 people from an isolated group of Aw\u00e1 indigenous people, described by the NGO Survival International as the world\u2019s most endangered tribe. Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has been widely criticised for failing to respond quickly to the crisis, issued a decree on Thursday banning fires in the Amazon for 60 days \u2013 a move environmentalists described as largely symbolic. The fires are often used to clear pasture and deforested areas in the Amazon during dry winter months, but there have been 28,000 this month \u2013 more than any August since 2010. Bolsonaro has been accused of helping stoke the crisis by encouraging invasions of protected reserves with his promises to develop the Amazon, and force his vision of progress on indigenous peoples. Campaigners say indigenous territories make easy targets for loggers and farmers and settlers seeking land or valuable wood. Antenor Vaz, a former employee at Brazil\u2019s indigenous agency Funai and consultant on isolated indigenous peoples, said research based on Nasa images showed that fires broke out in 131 indigenous reserves from 15-20 August.

They were told they had little choice but to carry on and advise ministers or resign.</p> <p>Some high-profile officials announced their departures as it became increasingly apparent that Johnson would enter Downing Street, and union leaders said Brexit crisis would have been a factor. \u201cThese are people who are able to make choices in their careers,\u201d a public sector union leader said.</p> <p>They include Jon Thompson, the chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, and Tom Shinner, who had led planning for a no-deal Brexit at the Department for Exiting the European Union.</p> <p>On Wednesday a former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/mps-call-for-drastic-action-against-prorogation-of-parliament/\">said officials</a> should consider putting their \u201cstewardship of the country ahead of service to the government of the day\u201d.</p> <p>Defending his comments on Thursday, Kerslake, who has previously advised Labour, said he was not advocating that civil servants try to subvert Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans, but he added: \u201cThese are exceptional times.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cI want civil servants to be providing robust advice because it is important to recognise what a serious position we are in. Some of things that Downing Street is talking about amount to an abuse of power, an undermining of our parliamentary democracy.\u201d</p> <p>The crossbench peer said the legality of Johnson\u2019s attempt to suspend parliament next month was as yet unclear because it was being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/proroguing-parliament-is-unlawful-abuse-of-power-court-told\">challenged in the courts</a>.</p> <p>Kerslake also pointed to press reports that No 10 could ignore the result of a no-confidence vote or refuse to send a bill preventing a no-deal Brexit to the Queen if opposition MPs could get one through parliament.</p> <p>Union leaders described Kerslake\u2019s comments as \u201cdeeply unhelpful\u201d, arguing they could be interpreted by hard Brexiters as a call for officials to frustrate the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum.</p> <p>Mike Clancy, the general secretary of Prospect, which represents rank-and-file civil servants, said: \u201cAt a time when politicians from all sides are lining up to attack civil servants and accuse them of political bias, these comments from Bob Kerslake are surprising.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street was also dismissive of Kerslake, describing his intervention as over the top. One insider pointed out that Kerslake had previous advised the Labour leader, Jeremy Corybn, on preparing for government.</p> <p>\u201cI would add him to the list of Labour people who have descended into hyperbole,\u201d the source said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Civil service morale has been hammered by the Brexit crisis, Whitehall insiders say, with senior officials increasingly asking whether they should quit. A former senior official who left in 2018 told the Guardian they had received \u201ca steady stream of inquiries\u201d from colleagues who felt their work was \u201cno longer purposeful\u201d because the focus on Brexit over the past year had strangled policymaking. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed is that Brexit policy has become incredibly centralised, while the government\u2019s loss of control of parliament means that officials can no longer be certain that any other policies are going to be enacted,\u201d they said. The sense of frustration began to emerge in the latter stages of Theresa May\u2019s premiership as it became clear Brexit had become the dominant issue in British politics, and it has continued with no sign of a solution. \u201cThe other thing making people want to leave is the realisation that they\u2019ll have to spend 10 years cleaning up the mess,\u201d the former official added. Union representatives said a handful of civil servants had got in touch on Thursday specifically to voice their concerns about Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to suspend parliament for five weeks from the middle of next month. They were told they had little choice but to carry on and advise ministers or resign. Some high-profile officials announced their departures as it became increasingly apparent that Johnson would enter Downing Street, and union leaders said Brexit crisis would have been a factor. \u201cThese are people who are able to make choices in their careers,\u201d a public sector union leader said. They include Jon Thompson, the chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, and Tom Shinner, who had led planning for a no-deal Brexit at the Department for Exiting the European Union. On Wednesday a former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake, said officials should consider putting their \u201cstewardship of the country ahead of service to the government of the day\u201d. Defending his comments on Thursday, Kerslake, who has previously advised Labour, said he was not advocating that civil servants try to subvert Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans, but he added: \u201cThese are exceptional times.\u201d He said: \u201cI want civil servants to be providing robust advice because it is important to recognise what a serious position we are in. Some of things that Downing Street is talking about amount to an abuse of power, an undermining of our parliamentary democracy.\u201d The crossbench peer said the legality of Johnson\u2019s attempt to suspend parliament next month was as yet unclear because it was being challenged in the courts. Kerslake also pointed to press reports that No 10 could ignore the result of a no-confidence vote or refuse to send a bill preventing a no-deal Brexit to the Queen if opposition MPs could get one through parliament. Union leaders described Kerslake\u2019s comments as \u201cdeeply unhelpful\u201d, arguing they could be interpreted by hard Brexiters as a call for officials to frustrate the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of Prospect, which represents rank-and-file civil servants, said: \u201cAt a time when politicians from all sides are lining up to attack civil servants and accuse them of political bias, these comments from Bob Kerslake are surprising.\u201d Downing Street was also dismissive of Kerslake, describing his intervention as over the top. One insider pointed out that Kerslake had previous advised the Labour leader, Jeremy Corybn, on preparing for government. \u201cI would add him to the list of Labour people who have descended into hyperbole,\u201d the source said.",

But it is also opposed, as shown by its votes, to a second referendum (which it rejected by an absolute majority) and membership of the internal market and the customs union, and it has shown no disposition to revoke article 50. The only positive policy MPs have supported is that embodied in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/brexit-backstop-amendment-would-give-may-enormous-firepower\" title=\"\">Brady amendment</a>, calling for the Irish backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements, something the EU declares it will not countenance.

Why should a third prove any different? Would MPs then accept the withdrawal agreement? Do they have the leverage to persuade the EU to alter its stance? Without an answer to these questions, a further extension is a mere empty aspiration. And were parliament to pass legislation preventing Britain leaving the EU without a deal, Brexit could be delayed for ever, since the Commons would then be free to reject every deal presented to it.</p> <p>The truth is that 650 MPs cannot make policy. Only the government can do that. The role of parliament is not to govern but to scrutinise those who do. That is especially the case with the treaty-making power. Indeed, parliament has not rejected a treaty <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-01-15/british-lawmakers-reject-prime-minister-theresa-mays-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">since 1864</a>. And parliament is in no position to renegotiate a treaty. It has never in modern times sought to do so. The EU can negotiate only with governments, not with a motley alliance of MPs who are themselves divided between remainers and soft Brexiteers.</p> <p>MPs have rejected the government\u2019s flagship policy without providing any alternative. It is enabled to pursue this course because of the wretched Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Without that, Theresa May could have declared the deal a matter of confidence. That was what Edward Heath did in 1972 when he threatened a dissolution unless the European Communities bill was passed, securing in consequence a majority of eight on its second reading. Had May been able to do the same, the rebels would either have come to heel or there would have been a general election. But the threat of dissolution has now been removed from the prime minister\u2019s armoury.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/cross-party-rebel-alliance-gears-up-for-brexit-clash-with-johnson\">No-deal Brexit: cross-party rebel alliance gears up for clash with Johnson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once MPs have rejected the flagship policy of any government, their obvious recourse is to remove it and replace it with one more to their liking. That requires a successful no-confidence vote and either an alternative government chosen from the existing House of Commons or, more likely, a general election so that the people can arbitrate. But Boris Johnson\u2019s opponents seem unsure that they could carry such a no-confidence vote. So there is an institutional deadlock that threatens to prevent Johnson from breaking the Brexit deadlock. That can now be broken only by the EU. In fact I suspect that the long prorogation is directed as much at the EU as Westminster, to convince the EU that parliament will not be able to stop a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>Looking at the sorry performance of the House of Commons elected in 2017, it is difficult to avoid remembering Winston Churchill\u2019s condemnation of the parliaments of the 1930s as being \u201cdecided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent\u201d.

And were parliament to pass legislation preventing Britain leaving the EU without a deal, Brexit could be delayed for ever, since the Commons would then be free to reject every deal presented to it. The truth is that 650 MPs cannot make policy. Only the government can do that. The role of parliament is not to govern but to scrutinise those who do. That is especially the case with the treaty-making power. Indeed, parliament has not rejected a treaty since 1864. And parliament is in no position to renegotiate a treaty. It has never in modern times sought to do so. The EU can negotiate only with governments, not with a motley alliance of MPs who are themselves divided between remainers and soft Brexiteers. MPs have rejected the government\u2019s flagship policy without providing any alternative. It is enabled to pursue this course because of the wretched Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Without that, Theresa May could have declared the deal a matter of confidence. That was what Edward Heath did in 1972 when he threatened a dissolution unless the European Communities bill was passed, securing in consequence a majority of eight on its second reading. Had May been able to do the same, the rebels would either have come to heel or there would have been a general election. But the threat of dissolution has now been removed from the prime minister\u2019s armoury. Once MPs have rejected the flagship policy of any government, their obvious recourse is to remove it and replace it with one more to their liking. That requires a successful no-confidence vote and either an alternative government chosen from the existing House of Commons or, more likely, a general election so that the people can arbitrate. But Boris Johnson\u2019s opponents seem unsure that they could carry such a no-confidence vote. So there is an institutional deadlock that threatens to prevent Johnson from breaking the Brexit deadlock. That can now be broken only by the EU. In fact I suspect that the long prorogation is directed as much at the EU as Westminster, to convince the EU that parliament will not be able to stop a no-deal Brexit. Looking at the sorry performance of the House of Commons elected in 2017, it is difficult to avoid remembering Winston Churchill\u2019s condemnation of the parliaments of the 1930s as being \u201cdecided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent\u201d. Parliament has shown itself not to be the solution to Brexit but the problem. \u2022 Vernon Bogdanor is professor of government at King\u2019s College London",

We want to start people thinking about how fashion can work with what the environment has on offer, rather than forcing itself on the environment in harmful ways.\u201d Prince Charles is \u201cvery appreciative\u201d of the project, say the designers, and has sent letters of encouragement. \u201cEvery so often the postman turns up with a registered post letter, bearing the royal seal.\u201d The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, in London, has already asked for a piece for its archives. Vin, who is British, began working with Omi, who was born in Singapore and worked for Christian Dior under John Galliano, in 2004. From the outset, sustainability has been their fundamental guiding principle; they describe themselves as an ideology as well as a fashion label. \u201cFifteen years ago, people called us hippies,\u201d recalls Vin. \u201cThe fashion industry still has a huge problem [with sustainability], but at least that is acknowledged now.\u201d He does not believe, however, that change is happening fast enough. He points to many aspects of the fashion system that are wasteful. \u201cFor instance, the promoting of a new designer who has short-lived success and then suddenly goes bust \u2013 there is so much waste in that.\u201d The pair, who have dressed Michelle Obama, Debbie Harry and Kate Moss, have partnered with the Savoy as advisers on sustainability. From next spring, the hotel\u2019s doormen will wear a Vin + Omi uniform which will be made from fabric created out of the hotel\u2019s own plastic waste.",

Lucy Bronze is on international duty, so she accepts the award via a video message. She looks slightly surprised, although I doubt many others are. She has been majestic for the last couple of years in particular. Lucy Bronze is the Women\u2019s Player of the Year! Well, that\u2019s made me very happy. Read all about it Any thoughts? That looks like an excellent draw for Liverpool, a decent one for City, and a tricky one for Spurs and Chelsea. Group F is the most eye-catchingly deadly, but Group D also looks very nasty. The full draw Group A Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Club Brugge, Galatasaray. Group B Bayern Munich, Tottenham Hotspur, Olympiacos, Red Star Belgrade.

The award for the best forward in last season\u2019s Champions League is ...

Group G Zenit Saint Petersburg, Benfica, Lyon Group A Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Club Brugge Group B Bayern Munich, Tottenham Hotspur, Olympiacos Group E Liverpool, Napoli, Salzburg Group C Manchester City, Shakhtar Donetsk, Dinamo Zagreb \u201cI\u2019m confused as to how they chose the teams for Pot 2,\u201d says Dylan Singfield. \u201cI get that they can\u2019t play teams in the same league but why for example, were Real Madrid not able to be put in the same group as Liverpool? I was hoping for a rematch.\u201d You don\u2019t want to go there, trust me. Once you\u2019ve seen the 482-page tournament regulations, you can\u2019t unsee it. Group H Chelsea, Ajax, Valencia Group D Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen Group F Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund, Internazionale The award for the best midfielder in last season\u2019s Champions League goes to ... Frenkie de Jong. Juventus and Atletico Madrid will meet again, which is good news for Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s masculinity. Group D Juventus, Atletico Madrid Group E Liverpool, Napoli (reprise) Group C Manchester City, Shakhtar Donetsk Group A Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid Group G for gimme Zenit Saint Petersburg, Benfica \u201cHi Rob!\u201d says Joe Sampson. \u201cIf they were designing a way to rid the draw of as much intrigue and excitement as possible, I suspect that this is the format they would come up with. Enjoy your day!\u201d Oh, I\u2019m enjoying my day all right. Group F Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund I don\u2019t think Chelsea have ever played Ajax before, although I\u2019m probably wrong. Group H Chelsea, Ajax Bayern and Spurs last met in the 1983-84 Uefa Cup Group B Bayern Munich, Tottenham Hotspur. It\u2019s time to draw the teams from Pot 2. \u201cThis is when the real excitement starts,\u201d says A Suit. Yes, yes, the award went to Virgil van Dijk. The award for best defender in last season\u2019s Champions League goes to ... Ashley Young. The draw so far Group A Paris Saint-Germain Group B Bayern Munich Group C Manchester City Group D Juventus Group E Liverpool Group F Barcelona Group G Zenit Saint Petersburg Group H Chelsea \u201cObviously, I hold you in the highest esteem, and so I assume you have some kind of sway over proceedings,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cLiverpool, Shakhtar, Zagreb and Genk, please, Rob. The Group of mild case of flu (famous last words\u2026).\u201d I wouldn\u2019t worry - I\u2019ve already played this season on my pen and paper and you reach the final again. GET ON WITH IT. It\u2019s time for the draw the individial awards for last season\u2019s competition. And the goalkeeper of the season is Alisson Becker. \u201cCantona winning something in Europe?\u201d says Gary Naylor, aiming pointedly below the belt. \u201cNovel...\u201d If I could only be bothered, I\u2019d love to write an On Second Thoughts about his European performances for Manchester United. They were nowhere near as bad as the received wisdom suggests. And with that, Cantona walked straight off the stage. Is there any point going ahead with the 2019-20 Champions League after that? Here comes Eric, wearing a red shirt and a flat cap. He looks like he hasn\u2019t shaved since 2003. This man is magnificent. And he\u2019s about to throw some sardines into the sea via the medium of prepared speech: \u201cAs flies to wanton boys, we are for the Gods. They kill us for the sport. Soon the science will not only be able to throw down the ageing of the cells; soon the science will fix the cells to the state, and so we\u2019ll become eternal. Only accidents, crimes, wars will still kill us. But unfortunately, crimes and wars will multiply. I love football. Thank you.\u201d Eric Cantona is about to receive the Uefa President\u2019s Award, belated recognition of his selfless attempt to kick xenophobia out of football in 1995. \u201cGroup of Death?\u201d sniffs Jason Straight. \u201cCity, Real, Lyon, Leipzig. How\u2019s that look?\u201d I\u2019d give that 7.7 on the GoD scale. The highest recording was 9.7 in the 1998-99 season: Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Brondby, with only one team guaranteed to go through. The preamble to the preamble to the main draw has begun. It would be good if, one year, they started drawing the balls straight away, 6pm CET sharp, catching half the assembled hacks on the hop, face down in a buffet plate. For now we are watching a montage of last season\u2019s ludicrously dramatic competition. \u201cBarcelona are looking for another striker, apparently,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cThey can manage a possible Group of Death if they snap up a well-known cricketer recently lauded for heroics, and use some of their muscle to lobby for a change in the UEFA relations to allow batting. And bowling.\u201d Oh, go on then. I think I\u2019m addicted to this. There\u2019s plenty of scope for a Group of Death. Chelsea, Real Madrid, Internazionale and Lille, perhaps, or Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund, Lyon and Atalanta. It\u2019s 37 years since English teams won the European Cup in consecutive seasons. There\u2019s a chance it could happen this year. Manchester City and Liverpool are, in the opinion of this hack, the two best teams in Europe. And while that guarantees the square root of bugger all, it beats being the 34th and 35th best teams in Europe. Hello and welcome to a new series of everyone\u2019s favourite TV feast, Champions League Draw. You know the drill: waffle, more waffle, a third course of waffle, and then that lot get the easiest possible draw again. These are the four pots from which balls shall be extracted. As ever, teams from the same country cannot be pooled together. Pot 1 Liverpool, Chelsea, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Zenit St Petersburg. Pot 2 Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Napoli, Shakhtar Donetsk, Tottenham, Ajax, Benfica. Pot 3 Lyon, Bayer Leverkusen, RB Salzburg, Olympiakos, Club Brugge, Valencia, Internazionale, Dinamo Zagreb. Pot 4 Lokomotiv Moscow, Genk, Galatasaray, RB Leipzig, Slavia Prague, Red Star Belgrade, Atalanta, Lille.",

The public\u2019s appetite to spend has remained strong but one thing it won\u2019t buy is doom and gloom. It would be surprising, though, if consumers were completely impervious to what is happening over Brexit. Surveys have suggested that consumer confidence is getting weaker even though spending in the shops and online has held up well. This is not an incongruous as it might seem. Consumers are normally asked how they feel about their own finances and also how they view the economy generally. The fact that employment is high and real wages are rising can leave people feeling good about their own prospects, even though watching the news and reading the papers can leave them wondering whether the country as a whole is going to the dogs. Growth will weaken markedly if consumer concerns about the state of the nation start to outweigh the feeling that they are personally better off. If that were to happen, consumers would be deferring spending just as businesses are deferring investment. There are warning signs from the monthly European commission survey of UK consumer confidence that this is a distinct possibility. Household confidence in the health of the economy fell to its lowest in seven years, but more worrying was the drop in confidence in their own financial situation because this tends to have a strong correlation with high street spending. The EC survey does not contain a regional breakdown but an insight into how consumer confidence is holding up in two different parts of England is provided by Algorithmic Economics, a company that has been charting the feelgood factor in Greater London and Rochdale since the start of 2018, using machine learning algorithms to monitor tweets. The findings suggest that attitudes towards Brexit might be affecting confidence levels. Despite being a lot wealthier, remain-voting London has consistently had a lower feelgood factor, with a steady fall each month since Easter.

Fearing a regulatory crackdown, it has now decided to adopt a more conservative strategy by concentrating on securing new customers rather than repeat business. This will be bad for Amigo\u2019s profits \u2013 and hence its share price \u2013 but is good news for the weak and vulnerable. All the problems with guarantor loans could have been predicted long ago and it is surprising the FCA did not take a tougher line earlier rather than face the charge that it is behind the curve. Expect a somewhat speedier response for claims management companies looking to find new cases of mis-sold products now that the deadline for applying for PPI compensation has passed.",

This assistance should be provided irrespective of whether the delay is the airline\u2019s fault.</p>\n    <p>The airlines have fought these compensation rules since they were introduced and passengers have had to go to court to get their money.

Balpa declined to comment on the claims. A two-day strike in August by Balpa pilots, which Ryanair had unsuccessfully sought to prevent with a high court injunction, failed to stop any of the 892 daily flights from operating, according to the airline. Although Balpa has refused to confirm pilot numbers, Ryanair has claimed that fewer than 30% of its 1,250 UK pilots voted for industrial action. In a statement delivered to customers who have booked travel next week, Ryanair said: \u201cAll Ryanair flights to/from UK airports on 2-4 September will operate as scheduled thanks to the efforts of over 95% of our UK pilots who have confirmed that they will work their rosters, and will not support this failed third [sic] Balpa strike action. \u201cWe do not expect any pilot strike disruptions to our schedule.\u201d Ryanair said that it had invited Balpa to meet to resume negotiations, but the union had refused.

      "bodyText": "The Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton has teamed up with a night club impresario and an early investor in a plant-based meat substitute to back a meat-free burger chain. Neat Burger, which willopen its first outlet just off London\u2019s Regent Street on Monday, is currently raising up to \u00a315m to fund expansion. It has lined up restaurants in Covent Garden and Kings Cross, is planning a US launch next year and aiming to open 14 outlets around Europe over the next two years. Hamilton\u2019s co-investors are the Italian entrepreneur Tommaso Chiabra \u2013 one of the first backers of the US vegan burger maker Beyond Meat \u2013 and Ryan Bishti,who owns the Cirque le Soir nightclubs in London, Manchester, Barcelona and Mykonos, and is also redeveloping Soho\u2019s iconic Windmill club. Bishti said: \u201cWe are not aiming for vegans or a plant-based niche, we are aiming to convert meat eaters. We are part of a movement happening when you look at the world today in the Amazon with deforestation for crops and agri-farming. This is a perfect way to make a change.\u201d Bishti said Neat Burger\u2019s chefs had spent 10 months working with the Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat to develop their own patty based on the US company\u2019s plant-based burger mix. Beyond Meat, which makes burgers based on pea protein from yellow peas and uses beetroot juice to ooze or \u201cbleed\u201d, joined the US stock market in May and its shares have since climbed 150%, valuing the business at nearly $10bn. It has previously teamed up with the UK restaurant chain Honest Burgers on a vegan burger and is also working with KFC in the US, to produce a meat-free version of the fast food chain\u2019s chicken nuggets and wings. With the number of UK vegans soaring from 150,000 in 2014 to 600,000 in 2018, according to the Vegan Society, and many more people opting to go meat-free a few times a week, manufacturers, supermarkets and restaurants are scrambling to cash in on the expanding market. The consumer goods giant Unilever bought the meat substitute company the Vegetarian Butcher, while Greggs is working on vegan versions of all its bestselling products, from steak bakes to pasties and doughnuts, after the success of a vegan sausage roll. Hamilton, who stopped eating meat in 2017, has a significant stake in Neat, according to Bishti, who is the majority owner of the business with Chiabra. The driver is the UK\u2019s richest sportsperson with a fortune of some \u00a3187m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.",

Suspending parliament felt \u201cunreal\u201d, particularly given the mothballing of Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly, but it was justified because of the 2016 referendum mandate to leave the EU, he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to follow through. Democracy has to stand firm.\u201d Paddy Malone, a chamber of commerce member in Dundalk, which borders Northern Ireland, said people were thanking God the republic had a written constitution to guard against prorogation. \u201cWe have checks and balances that protects us from this sort of thing. Bad and all as we are sometimes no taoiseach here could ever do that. We\u2019re just scratching our heads and wondering, is this for real?\u201d RC",

      "bodyText": "A court in France has jailed three members of the far-right pan-European group Generation Identity after it carried out an anti-immigrant operation in the Alps. The tribunal at Gap ordered the three to serve six months in prison and fined them \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,800) each; the organisation was ordered to pay a fine of \u20ac75,000, the maximum that could be imposed. In April 2018, about 100 members of Generation Identity \u2013 which has a branch in the UK \u2013 organised a vast operation to stop immigrants crossing into France near the Italian border at the Col de l\u2019\u00c9chelle. Group members, dressed in blue jackets, scaled the mountain pass at an altitude of 1,762 metres (5,781ft), unveiled a giant banner reading \u201cClosed border: no way\u201d and set up a \u201csymbolic border\u201d in the snow using plastic fencing. As part of the operation, they hired two helicopters to overfly the site, stating their aim was to ensure \u201cno illegal immigrants enter France\u201d. Organisers said they wanted to notify those trying to cross that the border was closed and \u201cshould return home\u201d. They pledged to continue \u201cpatrolling\u201d the area, but were removed by police. At an earlier hearing, the three defendants were accused of carrying out \u201cactivities carried out in conditions likely to create confusion with the exercise of a public duty in the mind of the public\u201d \u2013 in other words impersonating officials, in this case border guards. Their uniform jackets, marked vehicles and \u201cmilitary language\u201d were said to have deliberately led immigrants to believe they were police officers. In November 2017, an ITV investigation for the documentary Undercover \u2013 Inside Britain\u2019s New Far Right, claimed Generation Identity, which started in France claiming to represent \u201cindigenous Europeans\u201d, was recruiting British members and sending them to military-style training camps abroad. A senior Norwegian member told a reporter who infiltrated the group: \u201cWe want young normal people, who want to get involved and we train them.\u201d Generation Identity is a proponent of the far right \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory that claims white people are becoming a minority in Europe. Damhnait McKenna, the leader of the organisation\u2019s UK and Ireland branch, said its ideology was based on \u201cethnocultural identity\u201d and it wanted \u201call illegal immigrants\u201d repatriated. Six months before the Alps operation, Generation Identity had chartered a boat to stop humanitarian organisations picking up immigrants in the Mediterranean. The public prosecutor Rapha\u00ebl Balland had asked for the accused, Cl\u00e9ment Gandelin, 24, Romain Espino, 26, and Damien Lef\u00e8vre, 29, during an earlier court hearing in July to be sent to prison. Gandelin, from Lyon, is president of Generation Identity and claimed he was responsible for the operation the group labelled \u201cDefend Europe\u201d. Pierre-Vincent Lambert, a lawyer for the accused, said his client would appeal against the verdict. Generation Identity insists it is not far-, ultra- or alt-right and claims to vet members for extremist views. Police have been investigating links between the movement and the alleged gunman in the Christchurch mosque attacks that killed 51 people in March. Generation Identity is among those being targeted by a proposed law in the UK banning hate groups before they commit acts of violence. On Sunday, the Observer spoke to an informant who had infiltrated the UK group and claimed two members were currently serving in the Royal Navy.",

      "body": "<p>Before she had established herself as a significant presence on the orthodox stage, Gillian Hanna, who has died aged 75 from an autoimmune disease, worked with the socialist theatre groups <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jan/24/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">7.84</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unfinishedhistories.com/history/companies/belt-and-braces/\" title=\"\">Belt and Braces</a>. On one occasion during the 1970s heyday of fringe theatre she found herself with a number of female actors, all auditioning for the same small role with Belt and Braces. Gillian decided that enough was enough.</p> <p>Thus in 1975 she, Chris Bowler and Mary McCusker founded <a href=\"http://monstrousregiment.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Monstrous Regiment</a> (echoing John Knox\u2019s tract against rule by female monarchs), with the aim of reflecting more fully the lives of women.

In her final film, Genius (2016), directed by Grandage, she played Julia Wolfe, mother to Jude Law as <a href=\"https://www.biography.com/writer/thomas-wolfe\" title=\"\">the US novelist Thomas Wolfe</a>.</p> <p>Born in Buxton, Derbyshire, and brought up in Thornton Heath, Surrey, Gillian was the elder daughter of Irish parents, John Hanna, a GP, and Vera (nee Bryans), a pianist and singer. At Beresford House school, Eastbourne, she became head girl. As a child she spent holidays in Ireland, and she returned there to study at Trinity College Dublin, where she played in numerous student productions, including Lady Bracknell in Oscar Wilde\u2019s The Importance of Being Earnest. In 1967 she graduated with a first-class degree in modern languages. She had planned to be a simultaneous translator, but was immediately invited to play Mrs Sullen in The Beaux\u2019 Stratagem at the Gate theatre, Dublin, and so her professional stage career got under way. Work at the Liverpool Everyman and Newcastle University theatre followed, and then the experimental world of the fringe.</p> <p>Of her translations outside Monstrous Regiment, that of Fo\u2019s The Accidental Death of an Anarchist was used in a successful production in London at Wyndham\u2019s theatre (1980). She worked extensively with the Royal Court\u2019s international programme\u2019s summer school for playwrights, and in 2013 her translation of Fausto Paravidino\u2019s They Came Into My Field was performed at its international festival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab825f3ddb2dd4383b56dc6b360d70574003a1e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab825f3ddb2dd4383b56dc6b360d70574003a1e5/0_109_3344_2006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Hanna as Grandma and Patsy Ferran as Jim Hawkins in Bryony Lavery\u2019s version of Treasure Island, after Robert Louis Stevenson, at the Olivier, National Theatre, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gillian Hanna as Grandma and Patsy Ferran as Jim Hawkins in Bryony Lavery\u2019s version of Treasure Island, after Robert Louis Stevenson, at the Olivier, National Theatre, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Muir/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gillian and Diane Gelon, a lawyer, entered into a civil partnership the day after the arrangement became legal, in 2005.

In 1967 she graduated with a first-class degree in modern languages. She had planned to be a simultaneous translator, but was immediately invited to play Mrs Sullen in The Beaux\u2019 Stratagem at the Gate theatre, Dublin, and so her professional stage career got under way. Work at the Liverpool Everyman and Newcastle University theatre followed, and then the experimental world of the fringe. Of her translations outside Monstrous Regiment, that of Fo\u2019s The Accidental Death of an Anarchist was used in a successful production in London at Wyndham\u2019s theatre (1980). She worked extensively with the Royal Court\u2019s international programme\u2019s summer school for playwrights, and in 2013 her translation of Fausto Paravidino\u2019s They Came Into My Field was performed at its international festival. Gillian and Diane Gelon, a lawyer, entered into a civil partnership the day after the arrangement became legal, in 2005. They also married in Diane\u2019s native California in 2008, and had three wedding parties \u2013 Gillian loved parties. In all, Gillian and Diane lived together for 37 years, in London and in Dungeness, on the Kent coast, where with the architect Simon Conder they created an extraordinary home. Warmth, incisive intelligence and huge generosity of spirit characterised both Gillian\u2019s acting and her mentoring of younger actors. In her final days she was keen to see her family, colleagues and many friends. She is survived by Diane, her sister, Sara, her nieces, Joanna and Rebecca, and grandchildren, Alexis and Jacob. \u2022 Gillian Hanna, actor and translator, born 20 July 1944; died 18 August 2019",

Only yesterday, Labour\u2019s Margaret Beckett made exactly the comparison, noting that it didn\u2019t end well. But are there really any similarities, or is this just lazy history and easy rhetoric? Certainly, in the most famous case of Charles I\u2019s decision to dismiss parliament in 1629, the result was an 11-year dictatorship, decoratively known to history as the \u201cpersonal rule\u201d \u2013 and the imprisonment in the Tower of London of those who opposed him.

So the Johnson regime is doubly isolated, both from its natural base in the political establishment, and from the popular base that it\u2019s trying to misrepresent among ordinary people.

Without wishing to shock you, it\u2019s possible that these two individuals are sometimes the same person. Furthermore \u2013 and if your mind is already close to blowing, please look away now \u2013 it could be that the entities described as Prince Andrew\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d in <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/prince-andrew-hits-back-over-witch-hunt-duke-of-york-insists-claims-by-epsteins-sex-slave-are-a4223011.html\" title=\"\">a sympathetic Evening Standard story on Wednesday</a> are ALSO Prince Andrew himself. I know! He\u2019s literally never worked harder. At the age of 59, he\u2019s finally got a full-time job. Unfortunately, it\u2019s convincing people he\u2019s not a sex case.</p> <p>The Duke of York is, absolutely indisputably, a friend to sex cases \u2013 or sex case [singular], in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/19/prince-andrew-urged-to-tell-all-he-knows-about-jeffrey-epstein\" title=\"\">his late friend Jeffrey Epstein</a>. No point cavilling there. That particular aircraft carrier has sailed. Still, before we go on, all this clearly demands a recap.</p> <p>As you may know, Prince Andrew is currently what convention demands we style as \u201cin the news for all the wrong reasons\u201d. The story has long concerned his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who, at the time of his death in jail earlier this month, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/jeffrey-epstein-life-profile\" title=\"\">awaiting trial for running an international underage sex-trafficking operation</a>. It also concerns Virginia Giuffre (then Roberts), who alleges she was recruited as a child as Epstein\u2019s sex slave, and on whose bare hip Prince Andrew\u2019s hand is pictured in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/23/boorish-and-self-centred-little-love-for-prince-andrew-over-epstein-links\" title=\"\">now-infamous photograph</a>. Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times when she was 17. He categorically denies this.</p> <p>But rather than Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide making it all go away, the focus on the prince\u2019s friendship with him, and its nature, has intensified. Some of Epstein\u2019s private-jet logs, on which Prince Andrew\u2019s name reportedly occurs several times, have been uncovered, while footage of the prince peering cagily round the door of Epstein\u2019s New York mansion, some time after he was released from jail, has emerged. Last week, emails emerged in which a literary agent recounted seeing Andrew in said mansion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/22/prince-andrew-epstein-foot-massage\" title=\"\">receiving a foot massage with Epstein</a>, apparently from two well-dressed young Russian women. The duke was said to be complaining about public focus on his night-time activities.</p> <p>Perhaps troubled by the continuing inability to just make this shit go away, Buckingham Palace chose Saturday afternoon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/18/prince-andrew-appalled-by-epstein-sex-abuse-claims\" title=\"\">to put out a press release</a> in which Andrew attempted to \u2013 what\u2019s the euphemism? \u2013 clarify his position on a number of points. This turned out to be a curious document, different in layout from typical palace communications, and best described as a wildly disingenuous word salad. Milton it was not \u2013 although it did have the flavour of something proofread by him in his final years.</p> <p>Having been pored over, it was suspected by some royal watchers to be the work of Prince Andrew himself. Who can say? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time, with the prince having occasional form for going over the heads of staff and issuing things himself. Either way, let\u2019s take a look: \u201cAt no stage \u2026 did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.\u201d The suggestion seems to be that a court-convicted sex offender needs to commit his crimes physically in front of Prince Andrew for the prince to suspect he might be guilty of them.</p> <p>Moving on: \u201cI can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know.\u201d Without wishing to raise the tone by quoting Steven Seagal in Under Siege: what is this babbling bullshit? You knew he had been convicted of procuring a 14-year-old girl for prostitution and served jail time for it, in a case with huge amounts of supporting evidence and the testimony of more than 50 women telling similar stories. The rest \u2013 all the rest \u2013 is bullshit. Especially the bit about caring about the victims. You know the best way to look like you give one hundredth of a toss about the victims of sex cases? Don\u2019t be friends with the sex case in question! Don\u2019t stay with them in their mansions, don\u2019t get foot massages with them, don\u2019t get filmed looking surreptitiously round the front door as a procession of very young women come and go! It just looks \u2026 bad.</p> <p>As indicated, this stuff isn\u2019t complicated. But even if it were, it\u2019s important to remember that, unlike most people who pay their taxes to support him being helicoptered between golf courses, Prince Andrew has a dedicated team of people whose job it is to advise him which one of his friends is a weapons-grade scumbag. I\u2019m vaguely paraphrasing the official palace job description here. But it doesn\u2019t matter if we call them public relations experts, background vetters, wrong \u2019un sniffer-outers, or simply sentient humans over the age of 18 who can read. The royal family has got a team of them, who would have made these points about Epstein very, very clearly and very, very often.</p> <p>Anyway, back to this week. Surprisingly, Prince Andrew\u2019s oddly timed, unprofessional-reading statement didn\u2019t make all the shit go away, just as grinning sweatily in the car seat next to his mother on the drive to the church at Balmoral the previous weekend hadn\u2019t made all the shit go away, either. Again, to fall back on another news cliche, the press release \u201craised more questions than it answered\u201d.</p> <p>Yet worse was to come. On Tuesday, more than 20 of Epstein\u2019s accusers gathered to testify before a judge in a Manhattan hearing. Outside the courthouse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/27/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-epstein-accuser\" title=\"\">Giuffre declared of the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/27/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-epstein-accuser\" title=\"\">prince</a>: \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s done and he can attest to that. He knows exactly what he\u2019s done \u2013 and I hope he comes clean about it.\u201d Her lawyer added that he\u2019d made \u201cmultiple\u201d requests to Prince Andrew to \u201canswer real questions\u201d.</p> <p>Well now. This is the route that bring us to this Wednesday\u2019s debut of the \u201cchubby fingers\u201d defence.

      "bodyText": "Who has the fattest fingers: Prince Andrew or the person who types his press releases? Without wishing to shock you, it\u2019s possible that these two individuals are sometimes the same person. Furthermore \u2013 and if your mind is already close to blowing, please look away now \u2013 it could be that the entities described as Prince Andrew\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d in a sympathetic Evening Standard story on Wednesday are ALSO Prince Andrew himself. I know! He\u2019s literally never worked harder. At the age of 59, he\u2019s finally got a full-time job. Unfortunately, it\u2019s convincing people he\u2019s not a sex case. The Duke of York is, absolutely indisputably, a friend to sex cases \u2013 or sex case [singular], in the form of his late friend Jeffrey Epstein. No point cavilling there. That particular aircraft carrier has sailed. Still, before we go on, all this clearly demands a recap. As you may know, Prince Andrew is currently what convention demands we style as \u201cin the news for all the wrong reasons\u201d. The story has long concerned his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who, at the time of his death in jail earlier this month, was awaiting trial for running an international underage sex-trafficking operation. It also concerns Virginia Giuffre (then Roberts), who alleges she was recruited as a child as Epstein\u2019s sex slave, and on whose bare hip Prince Andrew\u2019s hand is pictured in a now-infamous photograph. Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times when she was 17. He categorically denies this. But rather than Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide making it all go away, the focus on the prince\u2019s friendship with him, and its nature, has intensified. Some of Epstein\u2019s private-jet logs, on which Prince Andrew\u2019s name reportedly occurs several times, have been uncovered, while footage of the prince peering cagily round the door of Epstein\u2019s New York mansion, some time after he was released from jail, has emerged. Last week, emails emerged in which a literary agent recounted seeing Andrew in said mansion, receiving a foot massage with Epstein, apparently from two well-dressed young Russian women. The duke was said to be complaining about public focus on his night-time activities. Perhaps troubled by the continuing inability to just make this shit go away, Buckingham Palace chose Saturday afternoon to put out a press release in which Andrew attempted to \u2013 what\u2019s the euphemism? \u2013 clarify his position on a number of points. This turned out to be a curious document, different in layout from typical palace communications, and best described as a wildly disingenuous word salad. Milton it was not \u2013 although it did have the flavour of something proofread by him in his final years. Having been pored over, it was suspected by some royal watchers to be the work of Prince Andrew himself. Who can say? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time, with the prince having occasional form for going over the heads of staff and issuing things himself. Either way, let\u2019s take a look: \u201cAt no stage \u2026 did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.\u201d The suggestion seems to be that a court-convicted sex offender needs to commit his crimes physically in front of Prince Andrew for the prince to suspect he might be guilty of them. Moving on: \u201cI can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know.\u201d Without wishing to raise the tone by quoting Steven Seagal in Under Siege: what is this babbling bullshit? You knew he had been convicted of procuring a 14-year-old girl for prostitution and served jail time for it, in a case with huge amounts of supporting evidence and the testimony of more than 50 women telling similar stories. The rest \u2013 all the rest \u2013 is bullshit. Especially the bit about caring about the victims. You know the best way to look like you give one hundredth of a toss about the victims of sex cases? Don\u2019t be friends with the sex case in question! Don\u2019t stay with them in their mansions, don\u2019t get foot massages with them, don\u2019t get filmed looking surreptitiously round the front door as a procession of very young women come and go! It just looks \u2026 bad. As indicated, this stuff isn\u2019t complicated. But even if it were, it\u2019s important to remember that, unlike most people who pay their taxes to support him being helicoptered between golf courses, Prince Andrew has a dedicated team of people whose job it is to advise him which one of his friends is a weapons-grade scumbag. I\u2019m vaguely paraphrasing the official palace job description here. But it doesn\u2019t matter if we call them public relations experts, background vetters, wrong \u2019un sniffer-outers, or simply sentient humans over the age of 18 who can read. The royal family has got a team of them, who would have made these points about Epstein very, very clearly and very, very often. Anyway, back to this week. Surprisingly, Prince Andrew\u2019s oddly timed, unprofessional-reading statement didn\u2019t make all the shit go away, just as grinning sweatily in the car seat next to his mother on the drive to the church at Balmoral the previous weekend hadn\u2019t made all the shit go away, either. Again, to fall back on another news cliche, the press release \u201craised more questions than it answered\u201d. Yet worse was to come. On Tuesday, more than 20 of Epstein\u2019s accusers gathered to testify before a judge in a Manhattan hearing. Outside the courthouse, Giuffre declared of the prince: \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s done and he can attest to that. He knows exactly what he\u2019s done \u2013 and I hope he comes clean about it.\u201d Her lawyer added that he\u2019d made \u201cmultiple\u201d requests to Prince Andrew to \u201canswer real questions\u201d. Well now. This is the route that bring us to this Wednesday\u2019s debut of the \u201cchubby fingers\u201d defence. Even as the rest of the media were obsessing over the breaking news that Boris Johnson was to ask the Queen to prorogue parliament, the Standard went with a splash headlined: \u201cPrince Andrew hits back over \u2018witch hunt\u2019: Duke of York insists claims by Epstein\u2019s \u2018sex slave\u2019 are \u2018categorically untrue\u2019.\u201d Yup, a three-scarequote headline. Your basic fairytale. Right off the bat, we need to note the timing of this, coming as it did as most media outlets were understandably taken up with prorogation \u2013 a course of executive action so clearly batshit and messed-up that Courtney Love is boggling at it.

      "bodyText": "The Insolvency Practitioners Association has announced it will investigate the company voluntary arrangement organised to cut the debts of Bury, who were expelled by the English Football League on Tuesday. The IPA said its decision to \u201cconsider the operation of the CVA\u201d, followed concerns expressed in the Guardian by the Bury North MP, James Frith, and the Football Supporters\u2019 Association. Frith has said he assumes it will also be \u201cstandard practice\u201d that the Insolvency Service, a government agency, will investigate. Frith\u2019s and the FSA\u2019s concerns centre on a \u00a37m claim admitted into the CVA as a debt owed by Bury to a company, Mederco, owned by Stewart Day, the club\u2019s former owner, which collapsed into administration in February. In December, shortly before Day declared insolvency at Mederco and several other of his property companies, he sold Bury for \u00a31 to Steve Dale, the owner in whose tenure the 134-year-old club has been expelled. In July Dale, who never satisfied the EFL that he had the necessary money to pay the club\u2019s debts and run it, worked to secure the CVA, which offered creditors 25p for every pound owed. The insolvency practitioner supervising the CVA, Steven Wiseglass, included in Bury\u2019s total creditors a \u00a37.1m debt stated to be owed to Mederco for loans to the club during Day\u2019s ownership. Creditors were told that this debt had been bought by RCR Holdings Ltd, a company formed two days before the meeting to consider the CVA. The scale of the \u00a37.1m debt was crucial to the CVA being passed. Last week the sole owner and director of RCR Holdings, Kris Richards, 41, confirmed to BBC Radio Manchester that he is the partner of Steve Dale\u2019s daughter. The Mederco administrator, the firm Leonard Curtis, had told that company\u2019s creditors that it could not establish how much money, if any, was owed by Bury. It said there was a \u201clack of evidence as to the accuracy and proof of the quantum of any debt\u201d and had sold RCR the potential claim to any debt for \u00a370,000. Dale told the Guardian last week that RCR Holdings, having had that \u00a37.1m admitted to the Bury CVA, would be seeking a quarter of that full sum alongside other creditors \u2013 \u00a31.75m, despite having paid only \u00a370,000. The IPA responded by saying it was issuing a statement, announcing an investigation into the Bury CVA, following the Guardian\u2019s report of Frith\u2019s and the FSA\u2019s calls for an inquiry. \u201cCVAs are a debt repayment solution that allows companies in debt to pay creditors over a fixed period,\u201d the IPA said. \u201cCVAs are stringently regulated and should command the highest level of diligence from insolvency practitioners [IPs]. \u201cThe IPA takes concerns arising from insolvency procedures extremely seriously and can confirm that, due to information that has been brought to its attention, and in line with processes to regulate IPs, it is considering the operation of the CVA relating to Bury football club.\u201d Wiseglass told the Guardian on Wednesday that he had admitted the Mederco \u00a37.1m debt because there was evidence at Bury for doing so. \u201cEverything relating to the CVA has been done properly,\u201d he said, \u201cbut of course I am regulated and, if there is any inquiry, I will deal with and cooperate with it.\u201d Dale has said: \u201cAll dealings with the CVA have been done in a correct and proper manner.\u201d The FSA had written to the IPA and R3, the insolvency practitioners\u2019 trade association, expressing its concerns, as the representative body for Bury\u2019s and all other English clubs\u2019 affiliated supporters\u2019 trusts and groups.

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s revived plans for a $2tn mega-listing of its state oil company may rule out the London Stock Exchange amid Britain\u2019s rising political uncertainty, according to reports. Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s most profitable company, may instead look to Japan\u2019s Tokyo stock exchange to host the second phase of what would be the biggest public offering in history. The oil giant\u2019s advisers had originally favoured an international stock market debut in either London or Hong Kong but political instability has reduced their appeal, according to the Wall Street Journal. The report said people familiar with Saudi Aramco\u2019s plans expect the company to split the listing into two stages; the first on the Saudi stock exchange later this year, and the second in 2020 or 2021. The decision to rule out London and Hong Kong would prove a major blow to both financial centres, which have courted the mega-float since it was first announced in early 2016. Last year the UK\u2019s City watchdog changed its listing rules, in a move widely viewed as a move designed to encourage Aramco to list in London. The plan to sell 5% of the oil giant\u2019s stock was originally expected in 2018, but a sluggish oil market recovery and fierce debate over how much to raise, and where, has stalled the plan. The IPO was dealt another blow in October last year following international outcry over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, reignited plans for the float earlier this summer after announcing that officials were working to list the company within the next two years. Aramco announced earlier this month, in its first investor call, that it is ready for the listing whenever its shareholders agreed market conditions were \u201coptimal\u201d. The company reported profits of $46.9bn for the first half of this year, down from $53.2bn in the first half of last year owing to lower oil prices. The earnings were still well ahead of the world\u2019s six biggest listed oil companies combined. The once secretive oil behemoth opened its books to international investors for the first time last year ahead of a record-breaking sovereign bond market debut. The debt issuance raised $12bn following overwhelming interest from major international investors. The company is taking steps to increase its transparency as part of the Saudi government\u2019s push to open the country to international investment, and diversify its economy beyond its enormous oil reserves. Aramco produced 13.2m barrels of oil a day in the first half of the year, more than four times the rate of production from rivals such as ExxonMobil, which produced 3.9m a day over the same period.",

SHORTLY!</h2> <p>With the draw for Big Cup not due to take place until shortly after today\u2019s thrilling instalment of the world\u2019s most tea-timely football email is detonated, it behoves the Fiver to bring you news of the England squad for next month\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Kosovo instead. While it\u2019s true that nobody is particularly keen on the interruption of an international break so early in the season, it is precisely these kind of games that England must win if they are to qualify for the right to not win their first major piece of silverware in 54 years.</p> <p>While there were no no major surprises in Southgate\u2019s 25-man squad, the first time inclusion of defenders Tyrone Mings and Aaron Wan-Bissaka has been seized upon by sports news editors savvy enough to realise that flagging up the selection of Everton\u2019s Michael Keane might not necessarily provide those precious, lovely clickety-click clicks. \u201cHe\u2019s an interesting case as he entered the game a bit later and hasn\u2019t played as much as a centre-back,\u201d said Southgate, peering at Mings, much like a jeweller might inspect a particular precious gem through his eyepiece. Included at the expense of Kyle Walker, Wan-Bissaka was also the subject of praise from Southgate. \u201cHe\u2019s adapted very well to a high-profile move with the intensity and pressure and we are really looking at him and Trent [Alexander-Arnold],\u201d he explained, in a feeble bid to conceal an apparent bias in favour of right-backs with double-barrelled surnames.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/england-squad-gareth-southgate-tyrone-mings-euro-2020-qualifiers\">Mings, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wan-Bissaka get England call-ups</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere in the squad, James Maddison and Mason Mount have been selected, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain returns to a group of midfielders that also includes Ross Barkley, Jordan Henderson, Harry Winks and Declan Rice \u2026 subject to the West Ham midfielder not having another change of heart and deciding he\u2019d rather play for Burkina Faso. \u201cWe only have eight matches before I name the squad for the European Championship,\u201d Southgate said, getting ahead of himself ever so slightly. But with his team already top of Group A having played fewer matches than any of their rivals, exiting this particular group of European nations with a minimum of fuss probably won\u2019t require Southgate to emulate his political counterpart and go running to the Queen.</p> <p><strong>England squad:</strong> Heaton (Aston Villa), Pickford (Everton), Pope (Burnley), Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Chilwell (Leicester), Gomez (Liverpool), Keane (Everton), Maguire (Man Utd), Mings (Aston Villa), Rose (Tottenham), Trippier (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid), Wan-Bissaka (Man Utd), Barkley (Chelsea), Henderson (Liverpool), Maddison (Leicester), Mount (Chelsea), Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool), Rice (West Ham), Winks (Tottenham), Fiver (Fiver Towers), Kane (Tottenham), Lingard (Man Utd), Rashford (Man Utd), Sancho (Borussia Dortmund), Sterling (Man City), Wilson (Bournemouth).</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/aug/29/champions-league-2019-20-group-stage-draw-live\">Join Rob Smyth for the hot Champions League group-stage draw action from 5pm</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">And join, um, Rob Smyth again for Wolves 2-0 (agg: 5-2) Torino in Big Vase</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cYou can try to make something of it, but to me it\u2019s nothing.

      "bodyText": "ENGLAND SQUAD, ASSEMBLE! SHORTLY! With the draw for Big Cup not due to take place until shortly after today\u2019s thrilling instalment of the world\u2019s most tea-timely football email is detonated, it behoves the Fiver to bring you news of the England squad for next month\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Kosovo instead. While it\u2019s true that nobody is particularly keen on the interruption of an international break so early in the season, it is precisely these kind of games that England must win if they are to qualify for the right to not win their first major piece of silverware in 54 years. While there were no no major surprises in Southgate\u2019s 25-man squad, the first time inclusion of defenders Tyrone Mings and Aaron Wan-Bissaka has been seized upon by sports news editors savvy enough to realise that flagging up the selection of Everton\u2019s Michael Keane might not necessarily provide those precious, lovely clickety-click clicks. \u201cHe\u2019s an interesting case as he entered the game a bit later and hasn\u2019t played as much as a centre-back,\u201d said Southgate, peering at Mings, much like a jeweller might inspect a particular precious gem through his eyepiece. Included at the expense of Kyle Walker, Wan-Bissaka was also the subject of praise from Southgate. \u201cHe\u2019s adapted very well to a high-profile move with the intensity and pressure and we are really looking at him and Trent [Alexander-Arnold],\u201d he explained, in a feeble bid to conceal an apparent bias in favour of right-backs with double-barrelled surnames. Elsewhere in the squad, James Maddison and Mason Mount have been selected, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain returns to a group of midfielders that also includes Ross Barkley, Jordan Henderson, Harry Winks and Declan Rice \u2026 subject to the West Ham midfielder not having another change of heart and deciding he\u2019d rather play for Burkina Faso. \u201cWe only have eight matches before I name the squad for the European Championship,\u201d Southgate said, getting ahead of himself ever so slightly. But with his team already top of Group A having played fewer matches than any of their rivals, exiting this particular group of European nations with a minimum of fuss probably won\u2019t require Southgate to emulate his political counterpart and go running to the Queen. England squad: Heaton (Aston Villa), Pickford (Everton), Pope (Burnley), Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Chilwell (Leicester), Gomez (Liverpool), Keane (Everton), Maguire (Man Utd), Mings (Aston Villa), Rose (Tottenham), Trippier (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid), Wan-Bissaka (Man Utd), Barkley (Chelsea), Henderson (Liverpool), Maddison (Leicester), Mount (Chelsea), Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool), Rice (West Ham), Winks (Tottenham), Fiver (Fiver Towers), Kane (Tottenham), Lingard (Man Utd), Rashford (Man Utd), Sancho (Borussia Dortmund), Sterling (Man City), Wilson (Bournemouth). LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Rob Smyth for the hot Champions League group-stage draw action from 5pm. And join, um, Rob Smyth again for Wolves 2-0 (agg: 5-2) Torino in Big Vase. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cYou can try to make something of it, but to me it\u2019s nothing.

By making a film like this I want them to feel it is not the end of the world if you run [for office] and lose.\u201d</p> <p>When asked if the Venice festival should have more then two films by female directors in its main competition, Al-Mansour said she believes more funding and support for female film-makers is the simplest way to improve representation.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a crack now, and we see things happening and changing. But it needs to happen at an earlier stage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt starts from financing. It starts with studios opening up their systems to more diverse directors. We\u2019ve seen a lot of women prove themselves, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/05/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson\">Brie Larson</a> who is carrying a huge film and showing it can make box office.\u201d</p> <p>Al-Mansour \u2013 who joined <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/global/haifaa-al-mansours-the-perfect-candidate-is-first-film-supported-by-saudi-film-council-1202805556/\">the kingdom\u2019s General Authority for Culture</a>, a body that oversees cultural and artistic development in Saudi Arabia \u2013 in 2018, spoke of the differing attitudes towards male and female directors in the film industry.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of women do a hit Sundance movie and it takes 10 years before they do another movie,\u201d she said. \u201cThen a male director makes a hit Sundance movie and he will move straight into making $30m movies. He makes that film and his career develops and moves. There is a crack in the system now, and we need to capitalise on it \u2026 it\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p> <p>The director became emotional when discussing the changes that she hopes can happen for young women in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world. \u201cWe should come together as women and support each other,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI think cultivating that sisterhood is the beginning of a real feminist movement at heart where we can empower a younger generation to not have to work as hard as we did to assert themselves. To come to the workplace and be respected. I want my daughter to enjoy a place like that in the future.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s most prominent female film director says there is a \u201cmomentum change\u201d in the country and that cinema is one of the most important tools in changing the fate of women, who are still are not considered legal persons there. Haifaa al-Mansour \u2013 who is one of only two women in the main 21-film competition \u2013 premiered The Perfect Candidate, her drama about a young female doctor who runs for public office, at the Venice film festival on Wednesday. \u201cFilm is a tool for change and a way to introduce new ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Saudi women \u2013 and women in the Middle East in general \u2013 there is a lot of push now: women can vote and drive, but women are reluctant to accept those roles.\u201d \u201cI want more women to be active members of [Saudi] society,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard \u2026 but there is a momentum change in Saudi Arabia right now and it\u2019s a chance for women to take advantage of it. By making a film like this I want them to feel it is not the end of the world if you run [for office] and lose.\u201d When asked if the Venice festival should have more then two films by female directors in its main competition, Al-Mansour said she believes more funding and support for female film-makers is the simplest way to improve representation. \u201cThere is a crack now, and we see things happening and changing. But it needs to happen at an earlier stage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt starts from financing. It starts with studios opening up their systems to more diverse directors. We\u2019ve seen a lot of women prove themselves, like Brie Larson who is carrying a huge film and showing it can make box office.\u201d Al-Mansour \u2013 who joined the kingdom\u2019s General Authority for Culture, a body that oversees cultural and artistic development in Saudi Arabia \u2013 in 2018, spoke of the differing attitudes towards male and female directors in the film industry. \u201cA lot of women do a hit Sundance movie and it takes 10 years before they do another movie,\u201d she said. \u201cThen a male director makes a hit Sundance movie and he will move straight into making $30m movies. He makes that film and his career develops and moves. There is a crack in the system now, and we need to capitalise on it \u2026 it\u2019s the only way.\u201d The director became emotional when discussing the changes that she hopes can happen for young women in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world. \u201cWe should come together as women and support each other,\u201d she said. \u201cI think cultivating that sisterhood is the beginning of a real feminist movement at heart where we can empower a younger generation to not have to work as hard as we did to assert themselves. To come to the workplace and be respected. I want my daughter to enjoy a place like that in the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Finally, the FTSE 100 index of top London-listed shares has ended the day nearly 1% higher at 7184, a gain of 69 points. David Madden of CMC Markets says hopes of trade war progress, and the prospect of a new Italian government, lifted stocks. He writes: The Chinese ministry for commerce made it clear they are keen to strike a deal, but at the same time they will not be pushed around. Beijing admitted that further trade tensions will be harmful to everyone, and foreign firms operating in China won\u2019t come under pressure, but at the same time, the country is willing to flex its financial muscles to inflict pain on the US should it see fit. The political mood in Italy has lightened too as there is a possibility the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party might form a government and in turn avoid a political crisis, at least in the near-term. Markets like stability and the possibility of a government being formed is boosting sentiment. Just in: President Trump appears to have given an interview to Fox News, and revealed that talks are taking place with China today, at a \u201cdifferent level\u201d (not quite sure what that means). Reuters has an interesting exclusive - they\u2019ve heard that India is hoping to woo foreign companies such as Apple, to encourage then to move operations from China to avoid the trade war. Here\u2019s a flavour: India is targeting companies including Apple, Foxconn and Wistron Corp with a charm offensive aimed at encouraging them to shift business out of trade war-hit China, according to a source and a document seen by Reuters. Several Indian officials met on Aug. 14 and discussed a list of \u201ctarget companies\u201d that also include Taiwan-headquartered contract manufacturer Pegatron Corp, a source with direct knowledge said. The dispute between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, has led to higher tariffs on goods worth billions of dollars and disrupted global supply chains, prompting companies to look at other investment avenues to escape higher tariffs. Amid suggestions that India is late to capitalise on the trade war, government ministries have been asked to submit their policies and incentive structures to Invest India, the country\u2019s foreign investment promotion agency. Nine sectors including electronics, autos pharmaceuticals and telecoms will be targeted. As predicted, stocks are rallying in New York following the conciliatory comments from Beijing. The news that China\u2019s commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Beijing wouldn\u2019t immediately respond to Trump\u2019s latest tariffs has cheered Wall Street. The Dow has jumped by more than 1%, gaining 293 points to 26,329 points. The tech-focused Nasdaq is 1.4% higher. Meanwhile, Greece\u2019s new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is making his first official trip to Berlin since his election last month. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith explains: Aides close to the centre right leader say he will not be visiting Germany with a \u201claundry list of demands\u201d but rather focusing on his reform agenda \u201cand issues that concern the present and future of Europe.\u201d In the past the focus of such trips, they say, had been \u201call about cutting us slack when it came to implementing tough fiscal measures.\u201d Under its third and final bailout agreement, Athens\u2019 former leftist government committed to achieving the controversially high primary surplus of 3.5 % \u2013 a promise that has been repeatedly slammed as unrealistic. One aide said: \u201cWe will not be making any such requests. \u201cInstead, this visit is going to be about setting a new tone, turning a new page in a new era.\u201d Mitsotakis, a former banker, says attracting investments \u2013 the cornerstone of his economic policy \u2013 will be at the centre of his talks with Angela Merkel along with his pet subject of green energy and its role in sustainable growth for Europe and tourist-dependent economies like Greece. The two leaders have held a news conference, where Mitsotakis struck an emollient tone: \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the Germany people for the understanding they showed Greece.\u201d \u201cI want to change the narrative ... Greece is no longer the \u201cproblematic country\u201d in a Europe faced with Brexit and so many other challenges.\u201d This chart shows how US exports fell in the last quarter, and companies ran down their inventories rather than restocking -- two factors that slowed economic growth. Just in: Updated growth figures from the US have confirmed that the economy slowed in the second quarter of 2019. They show that GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.0%, very slightly lower than the 2.1% first estimated (but basically still 0.5% growth on a quarterly basis). That\u2019s down from 3.1% in the first three months of 2019. Today\u2019s data show that consumer spending continued to prop up the economy, growing by 4.7%. However, net trade pulled growth back, with exports falling The Bureau of Economic Analysis blamed \u201cdownturns in inventory investment, exports, and nonresidential fixed investment\u201d for the slowdown in growth. Today is the final deadline for UK bank customers to file compensation claims for missold PPI insurance.... and there\u2019s a predictable scramble. Despite having had literally years to get their claims in, plenty of people are only making inquiries today. And just as predictably, some banks are struggling to cope. Santander has been fielding complaints from unhappy customers all morning, who say they can\u2019t get through to the PPI helpline, or who are struggling to get the online form to work. For example: Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has some advice: \u201cAs predicted, there is unprecedented last-minute demand for reclaiming PPI. We\u2019ve seen our own traffic to our tool increase by over twentyfold in the last two days since we started the media campaign. And that huge demand is causing even major bank systems to creak and struggle. \u201cThe obvious first advice is to take time, be prepared and be patient. However, it is simply not fair or right that people who have tried to submit a claim before the deadline and have been disenfranchised by bust bank tech miss out. \u201cTake a timed screenshot if possible of any page that isn\u2019t working, and if not at least take notes of what you did and when you tried, because almost certainly the regulator will have to ensure that people who miss the deadline because of bad bank tech will still be able to get their claim in, and we will be pushing for it to do so.\u201d Italian credit-default swaps (a measure of concern that Italy could default on its debts) have fallen to a one-month low, following Conte\u2019s reinstatement as PM. Stocks are rallying in Milan too, where the FTSE MIB index of top Italian companies is up 1.9% today, outpacing the rest of Europe. Back in the eurozone, Italian bond yields have hit record lows after prime minister Giuseppe Conte was sworn in to lead a new government. Conte, whose future was in doubt last week, has retained his position after the anti-establishment Five Star Movement party hammered out a new coalition deal, with the centre-left Democratic Party. The two parties face a tough battle - Italy\u2019s economy stagnated in the last quarter (and hasn\u2019t actually grown over the last year). The previous government hoped to boost spending and cut taxes to boost growth, but ran into opposition from Brussels. Speaking after accepting the job again, Conte declared: We must transform this crisis into an opportunity. In response, investors piled back into Italian debt, sending the yield (or interest rate) on its 10-year bonds down to just 0.96%, an all-time low. The reassuring comments from Beijing are likely to push shares higher in New York. Wall Street is tipped to rally by almost 1% when trading begins in under three hours, as investors welcome the prospect of fresh negotiations between the US and China next month. As Connor Campbell of City brokerage Spreadex puts it: \u201cThe markets are so desperate for any sign of progress \u201cWarranted or not, that seems to have been enough for them to jump significantly this morning.\u201d A trade war breakthrough might calm worried that America could fall into recession next year. Small business expert Gene Marks argues, though, that such fears are overdone: In less good news, UK economic confidence has hit its lowest level in almost eight years, according to the EC\u2019s monthly healthcheck. That suggests that the Brexit crisis, and the ongoing trade war tensions, are hurting: There\u2019s a similar impact in Ireland: Economic confidence across the eurozone has risen, calming fears of a recession. The European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator recorded a surprise increase in August, from 102.7 to 103.1. That\u2019s a two-month high, up from July\u2019s three-month low. Firms reported a small pick-up in new orders and export orders, and are marginally more positive about the future. ING\u2019s Bert Colijn says it\u2019s a small, positive sign: While this is a marginal improvement and by no means suggests a growth recovery, it at least shows that the eurozone is not moving closer to a recession in these rather uncertain economic times. However, there are plenty of downside risks... With a deadline on Brexit coming up, the heating trade war between the US and China and possible car tariffs still hanging over the eurozone economy, concerns about continued industrial weakness could become bigger before they retreat. Heads-up, travellers. Climate emergency activists have announced they\u2019ll fly drones near Heathrow next month in an attempt to stop the airport functioning. They reckon it will force flights to be suspended, with \u201cup to 100\u201d people apparently taking part. More here: This sudden burst of trade war optimism has swept the FTSE 100 up by over 1%, or 73 points, back to 7188 points. That\u2019s a one-week high. Clearly traders are desperate for good news on the US-China trade war front -- but they should remember that similar hopes have been dashed before. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says \u201cpositive noises\u201d from Beijing are pushing shares up. A spokesperson for China\u2019s ministry of commerce, said that an escalation in trade tensions is not good for China, the US, or the rest of the world. Beijing reiterated its opposition to a trade war, and it will not discriminate against foreign firms operating in China, but at the same time it reminded the US it has ample retaliatory measures. The largely hopeful tones of the update from China has lifted market sentiment, and that sparked buying this morning. US-China relations have been volatile recently, but for now there is a sense that things are heading in the right direction, and that has coaxed some traders back into the market. Beijing appears to be taking a grown-up approach to the trade war, says Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital. NEWSFLASH: Market are rallying after China\u2019s government officials tried to calm the trade war with America. In a potentially significant move, Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng has suggested Beijing will not immediately retaliate to America\u2019s latest tariffs, when they kick in on Sunday. Gao told reporters that China was focused on ending the trade war, not escalating it, saying: \u201cChina has ample means for retaliation, but thinks the question that should be discussed now is about removing the new tariffs to prevent escalation of the trade war,\u201d \u201cChina is lodging solemn representations with the U.S. on the matter.\u201d That will be welcome news to US companies who deal with China, who must have been worrying that Beijing would hit back. As explained earlier, America plans to impose a new 15% tariffs on imports of imports of tech products and shoes from China, from Sunday. Geng also revealed that China and the US are talking holding face-to-face talks next month (something Stephen Mnuchin was coy about overnight), and insisted that China is open to resolving the dispute calmly. These comments are going down well with investors. European stock markets are rallying, with the Stoxx 600 index of top European shares up 0.8%. The US stock market is also getting a boost, in the futures market: Good news from France: Its economy is growing faster than expected. New data shows that French GDP rose by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2019, up from the initial estimate of 0.2%. INSEE, France\u2019s statistics body, reports that business investment jumped by 0.9% during the quarter (up from +0.5% in Q1), while household consumption rose by 0.2% (down from 0.3%). That suggests France\u2019s economy is picking up, despite the disruption caused by the Yellow Vest protests in recent months. Net trade also boosted growth, despite the US-China trade war -- but only because imports fell by 0.2% while exports were flat. Growth of 0.3% means France is expanding faster than the eurozone average of 0.2%, and ahead of the UK and Germany which both contracted. Over in Australia, policymakers are fretting about the consequences of the US-China trade war. Thinktank China Maters has warned that Australia \u201cwill not be able to avoid economic disruption\u201d if China were to suffer a \u2018hard landing\u2019. That could include mine closures and job losses across Australia\u2019s mining industry -- and leave a big hole in the country\u2019s finances. More here: Ouch! Shares in one of Britain\u2019s biggest tech companies have tumbled by nearly a third this morning, after it slashed its revenue outlook. Micro Focus, the Berkshire-based software firm, warned the City that trading was weaker than expected. It no longer expects to hit its target of a 4%-6% drop in revenue this financial year -- it now forecasts a 6%-8% slump. In a gloomy statement, it said: Weak sales execution has been compounded by a deteriorating macro environment resulting in more conservatism and longer decision making cycles within our customer base. Investors aren\u2019t pleased -- Micro Focus shares are down 29% at \u00a310.97, having hit \u00a321 in early July. Micro Focus launched a blockbuster $8.8bn takeover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s software business two years ago, but has been struggling. No-deal Brexit fears are pushing the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized firms down. The FSE 250 has lost 53 points, or 0.3%, to 19,149. Consumer credit firm Amigo is the top faller, slumping by 26% after missing profit expectations this morning, and cutting its forecasts. European stock markets have opened cautiously, with small losses in France and Germany. Italy is looking brighter, though, after Movement 5 Star and the Democratic Party agreed to form a new coalition, avoiding snap elections. US retailers are extremely unhappy that fresh tariffs will be imposed on Chinese goods on Sunday. The new levy, of 15%, will be applied to $125bn of products, including footwear, smartwatches, Bluetooth headphones and flat panel televisions. A second batch of products, including mobile phones, computers and toys, are being spared until December. Hundreds of retailers have written a joint letter to Trump, warning that US families will be hurt by the tariffs. It says: \u201cImposing tariffs in September on the majority of all footwear products from China - including nearly every type of leather shoe - will make it impossible for hardworking American individuals and families to escape the harm that comes from these tax increases\u201d Reuters has more details here: Retailers howl as U.S. trade agency locks in 15% tariffs on September 1 There\u2019s now a 50-50 chance that Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal in two months time, says Deutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid. The decision to prorogue parliament will trigger a major political battle next month, they say, which could potentially lead to a unity government. Reid says: The reality now is that under the new schedule, UK parliament has just under a week in early September followed by just over a week in late October to prevent a no deal outcome. Assuming the timings are too tight and therefore legislation to block a no deal Brexit fails, the only option left for MPs would be a motion of no confidence in the government \u2013 either next week or in the last two weeks of October. Much will now depend on the strategy taken by anti no deal MPs over the next two weeks. Our house view is still 50/50 for a no deal Brexit with the most likely path to preventing one being the formation of a national unity government either in early September or late October. My take on this is that it is partly a political move aimed at shoring up the support of leavers in the country and removing the need for such minded voters to support the Brexit Party at a General Election. The gamble is that the remain vote (probably also solidified the other way by this decision) would be more split across other parties (especially Labour and the Liberal Democrats). The more Parliament tries to blocks the move the more it could shore up support for Boris Johnson amongst the \u201cleave\u201d vote ahead of what might be a General Election before year-end. A fascinating and turbulent two months awaits us here in the UK. This flowchart (larger version here) shows how various scenarios could play out: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two issues are dominating investors\u2019 minds today - the US-China trade war (again) and the Brexit crisis (ditto). As things stand, America will impose new tariffs on Chinese imports on Sunday, further escalating the dispute with Beijing. Overnight, Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin played down hopes of a breakthrough soon -- telling reporters that he expects Chinese negotiators to visit Washington soon, but wouldn\u2019t reveal when. A notably uncommittal Mnuchin would only say: \u201cWe continue to have conversations. We\u2019re planning for them to come.\u201d White House trade adviser Peter Navarro also warned that a deal doesn\u2019t appear close, telling Fox News that: \u201cI can tell you that it\u2019s unlikely anything quick will happen given the structural basis of the problems.\u201d Such cautious talk undermines hopes that negotiations could resume, and make rapid progress, before the US levies higher tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese exports. The first tranche, on over $100bn of goods, will be imposed in just three days time: Fears that the global economy is weakening are stalking the bond markets again today, with the yield on long-dated 30-year US debt at an all-time low. After yesterday\u2019s wobbles, the pound is stable this morning at around $1.22 to the US dollar, and \u20ac1.101 to the euro. But sterling is still vulnerable, as the anger over the decision to suspend parliament for five weeks reverberates around Westminster, and beyond. Markets were caught off guard by the government\u2019s sudden move to ask the Queen to prorogue parliament, triggering a burst of selling yesterday: City economists say that a no-deal Brexit is looking more likely, as Boris Johnson tries to limit MPs ability to block the UK crashing out of the EU. Oliver Blackbourn of asset managers Janus Henderson Investors warned clients to expect more turmoil in the next few weeks: The PM\u2019s move is likely to precipitate a no-confidence vote in his government as soon as parliament returns after its summer break at the start of September. The challenge for those opposed to the government\u2019s actions lies in their ability to effectively organise the apparent majority against \u201cno deal\u201d within the time constraints now in place. They must either bring legislation to prevent this type of Brexit or find a unity candidate to lead a new administration within the coming days. Expect to see arcane parliamentary procedures used by both sides towards either outcome. Summer holidays are definitely over for MPs, now comes the shouting. Our Politics Live blog is covering all the action: Also coming up: We get a major healthcheck on Europe\u2019s economy today, with eurozone confidence reports, German jobless figures and updated French growth data. Fresh US trade data could also be interesting, in the light of the trade war. The agenda 7.45am BST: Second estimate of French GDP for Q2 2019 8.55am BST: German unemployment figures for August 10am BST: Eurozone business and consumer confidence surveys 1.30pm BST: Second estimate of US GDP for Q2 2019 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for July",

      "bodyText": "Archaeologists excavating what is thought to be the world\u2019s largest child sacrifice site have unearthed the skeletons of 227 young victims in the coastal desert of northern Peru. Teams have been digging since last year at the sacrificial site in Huanchaco, a beachside tourist town close to Trujillo, Peru\u2019s third largest city. Experts believe the children, who were aged between four and 14, were sacrificed by the Chim\u00fa culture to placate the gods as rains and floods caused by the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern battered the Peruvian coastline. \u201cThis is the biggest site where the remains of sacrificed children have been found,\u201d chief archaeologist Feren Castillo told AFP on Tuesday. \u201cThere isn\u2019t another like it anywhere else in the world.\u201d He said the children had been sacrificed to appease the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon and showed signs of being killed during wet weather. Castillo, an archaeologist at the National University of Trujillo, said that there may still be more to be found. \u201cIt\u2019s uncontrollable, this thing with the children. Wherever you dig, there\u2019s another one,\u201d he added. The children\u2019s remains were found in a position facing the sea. Some still had skin and hair and had been found with silver earrings. Huanchaco was a site where many child sacrifices took place during the time of the Chim\u00fa culture, whose apogee was between 1200 and 1400. Archaeologists first found children\u2019s bodies at the dig site in the town\u2019s Pampa la Cruz neighbourhood in June 2018, unearthing 56 skeletons. Pampa la Cruz is a short distance from Huanchaquito, where the remains of 140 sacrificed children and 200 llamas were found in April 2018. Excavation work at Huanchaquito started in 2011, but the findings were first published last year by National Geographic, which helped finance the investigation. Researchers there found footprints that had survived rain and erosion. The small footprints indicate the children were marched to their deaths from Chan Chan, an huge, ancient adobe city a mile from the burial site. The children\u2019s skeletons contained lesions on their breastbones, which were probably made by a ceremonial knife. Dislocated ribcages suggest whoever was performing the sacrifices may have been trying to extract the children\u2019s hearts. The Chim\u00fa civilisation extended along the Peruvian coast to Ecuador but disappeared in 1475 after it was conquered by the Inca empire, which in turn fell to the Spanish conquistadors. The region still suffers the devastating effects of El Ni\u00f1o. In March 2017, 67 people were killed and thousands more forced to evacuate by intense rains which damaged 115,000 homes and destroyed more than 100 bridges in Peru. In 1998, a \u201csuper\u201d El Ni\u00f1o hit Peru, killing more than 300 people and causing billions of dollars of damage. AFP contributed to this report",

The EPA is claiming the changes would save the oil and gas industry $17m to $19m a year, or up to $123m by 2025.</p> <p>Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former energy lobbyist, said methane is valuable so industry already has an incentive to minimize leaks. He called existing rules \u201cunnecessary and duplicative\u201d.</p> <p>The Trump administration has moved to erase all of Obama\u2019s climate policies and to ease other pollution controls for oil, gas and coal companies. Not all of industry has supported those changes. For example, car companies are currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/22/automakers-snub-trump-to-side-with-climate-crisis-says-obama-era-official\">pushing back</a> against a weakening of mileage standards.</p> <p>The advocacy group the Clean Air Task Force said the EPA is ignoring decades of its own precedent and mountains of evidence that cutting methane is easy and extremely important.</p> <p>\u201cIf the EPA manages to finalize and implement this illegal proposal, it will have devastating impacts on our climate for years to come,\u201d said the group\u2019s attorney Darin Schroeder.</p> <p>He said the EPA\u2019s methane rollbacks will lead to industry \u201cdumping an additional 1.2m tons of methane into the air in 2025 \u2013 which will warm the planet as much as the pollution from 22m cars.\u201d</p> <p>Janet McCabe, a top air official under Obama, noted that methane has about 25 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. Its impacts could be even larger. And methane makes up about 10% of warming pollutants in the US.</p> <p>A study by the advocacy group the Environmental Defense Fund also argues the oil and gas industry is releasing more methane than is reported.</p> <p>McCabe said the rule changes are a \u201crejection of the vast \u2013 the increasing \u2013 body of science that shows that climate change is affecting humans around the globe\u201d. She said the rule changes would make regulations more uncertain for companies.</p> <p>Some of the companies that have already made investments in eliminating their methane leaks agreed.</p> <p>The oil trade group the American Petroleum Institute supports the rollback, but Exxon, Shell and BP have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/climate/epa-to-roll-back-regulations-on-methane-a-potent-greenhouse-gas.html\">spoken in favor</a> of restrictions. Smaller oil producers say the Obama standards would be too expensive and would make it hard for them to compete with the majors.</p> <p>The API argues that nixing the rules will \u201cstrengthen emissions standards\u201d by reducing duplication with existing state programs, providing clarity for industry and making it easier for operators to use \u201cnew, innovative technologies\u201d.</p> <p>Congressman Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, said it should be telling that the industry itself is split over the changes.</p> <p>\u201cLast month the planet experienced its hottest month in recorded history. The threat of climate change to human life and livelihoods has never been clearer, and yet the Trump administration is acting to allow an increase in the dangerous emissions which cause it,\u201d Beyer said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration is rolling back requirements that oil and gas drillers correct leaks of methane \u2013 a potent heat-trapping pollutant contributing to the climate crisis. The Environmental Protection Agency announced the proposal on Thursday, against the wishes of some major oil companies. Trump will reverse standards issued by Barack Obama that forced companies to install controls to curb methane releases from drilling operations, pipelines and storage facilities. The EPA is claiming the changes would save the oil and gas industry $17m to $19m a year, or up to $123m by 2025. Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former energy lobbyist, said methane is valuable so industry already has an incentive to minimize leaks. He called existing rules \u201cunnecessary and duplicative\u201d. The Trump administration has moved to erase all of Obama\u2019s climate policies and to ease other pollution controls for oil, gas and coal companies. Not all of industry has supported those changes. For example, car companies are currently pushing back against a weakening of mileage standards. The advocacy group the Clean Air Task Force said the EPA is ignoring decades of its own precedent and mountains of evidence that cutting methane is easy and extremely important. \u201cIf the EPA manages to finalize and implement this illegal proposal, it will have devastating impacts on our climate for years to come,\u201d said the group\u2019s attorney Darin Schroeder. He said the EPA\u2019s methane rollbacks will lead to industry \u201cdumping an additional 1.2m tons of methane into the air in 2025 \u2013 which will warm the planet as much as the pollution from 22m cars.\u201d Janet McCabe, a top air official under Obama, noted that methane has about 25 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. Its impacts could be even larger. And methane makes up about 10% of warming pollutants in the US. A study by the advocacy group the Environmental Defense Fund also argues the oil and gas industry is releasing more methane than is reported. McCabe said the rule changes are a \u201crejection of the vast \u2013 the increasing \u2013 body of science that shows that climate change is affecting humans around the globe\u201d. She said the rule changes would make regulations more uncertain for companies. Some of the companies that have already made investments in eliminating their methane leaks agreed. The oil trade group the American Petroleum Institute supports the rollback, but Exxon, Shell and BP have spoken in favor of restrictions. Smaller oil producers say the Obama standards would be too expensive and would make it hard for them to compete with the majors. The API argues that nixing the rules will \u201cstrengthen emissions standards\u201d by reducing duplication with existing state programs, providing clarity for industry and making it easier for operators to use \u201cnew, innovative technologies\u201d. Congressman Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, said it should be telling that the industry itself is split over the changes. \u201cLast month the planet experienced its hottest month in recorded history. The threat of climate change to human life and livelihoods has never been clearer, and yet the Trump administration is acting to allow an increase in the dangerous emissions which cause it,\u201d Beyer said.",

His resolve to keep Runkerry House out of Catholic control reflected a mindset common to unionist and Protestant leaders of that era, said Graham Walker, a historian at Queen\u2019s University.</p> <p>\u201cThere was an obsession about losing territory,\u201d said Walker. \u201cThey pointed to Catholic numbers increasing over the years and so there was this notion of holding on to symbolic territory.\u201d</p> <p>Macnaghten made his offer in a letter to Sir William Scott, the head of the Northern Ireland civil service. It was dated 22 March 1950 and sent from his Campden Hill Court address in Kensington.</p> <p>The former judge and Derry MP, then aged 80, said his sister\u2019s recent death had left him in possession of Runkerry: \u201cA large house, occupying an incomparable site with a view of Donegal in the distance, with 20 bedrooms as well as spacious attics for the staff of domestic servants and rooms in the basement for the male servants.\u201d</p> <p>He had no use for it but feared selling lest the Catholic church snap it up, as it had another prominent property in nearby Portglenone, he said. \u201cThe house is a prominent feature on the landscape. The district around it is almost wholly Protestant.\u201d He said he would be \u201cvery pleased if our NI government would accept it as a gift from me\u201d. The government accepted.</p> <p>Macnaghten\u2019s 69-year-old letter was among files from the 1990s recently released by the Public Record Office. Officials studied the letter in 1994 because of plans to sell the estate, which was costly to maintain, and an attempt by Macnaghten\u2019s grandson, Sir Patrick Macnaghten, to claim it.</p> <p>The letter\u2019s sectarianism shocked Graham Thompson, who was a civil servant in the Department of Finance and Personnel. \u201cIt was so blatant,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt really jumped out. It was an insight into how people thought at that time.

      "bodyText": "Runkerry House is one of Northern Ireland\u2019s grand country homes, a landmark Victorian-era manor overlooking the ocean near the Giant\u2019s Causeway. Built by Edward Macnaghten in 1885, it boasted 20 bedrooms, 5.6 hectares (14 acres) of gardens and a beautiful location by Bushfoot Strand in Portballintrae, County Antrim. It has embodied not just grandeur but generosity because in 1950 Macnaghten\u2019s son, Sir Malcolm Macnaghten, gifted the estate, worth \u00a33.25m in today\u2019s money, to Northern Ireland\u2019s government. But there was, it turns out, a less than philanthropic reason for such munificence. Newly declassified documents reveal Macnaghten, an MP and high court judge, wanted to keep the property out of Catholic hands. \u201cI could no doubt sell it at a price but I am very unwilling to do so lest it \u2026 fall into the hands of the Roman Catholic Church,\u201d he said in a letter to the unionist-dominated government at Stormont. \u201cThe idea that the house should become a RC monastery or convent or seminary is abhorrent to me as it would have been to my father.\u201d The statement, first reported this week by the Belfast News Letter, casts Runkerry House in a new and unflattering light as a symbol of the brazen sectarianism of a state set up to ensure a Protestant majority: the Northern Ireland prime minister, Basil Brooke, had once urged an audience \u201cto employ good Protestant lads and lassies only, and not Catholics\u201d. The disclosure also tarnishes the reputation of Macnaghten, an establishment scion who through his family was linked to social reform and leftwing activism in London. His resolve to keep Runkerry House out of Catholic control reflected a mindset common to unionist and Protestant leaders of that era, said Graham Walker, a historian at Queen\u2019s University. \u201cThere was an obsession about losing territory,\u201d said Walker. \u201cThey pointed to Catholic numbers increasing over the years and so there was this notion of holding on to symbolic territory.\u201d Macnaghten made his offer in a letter to Sir William Scott, the head of the Northern Ireland civil service. It was dated 22 March 1950 and sent from his Campden Hill Court address in Kensington. The former judge and Derry MP, then aged 80, said his sister\u2019s recent death had left him in possession of Runkerry: \u201cA large house, occupying an incomparable site with a view of Donegal in the distance, with 20 bedrooms as well as spacious attics for the staff of domestic servants and rooms in the basement for the male servants.\u201d He had no use for it but feared selling lest the Catholic church snap it up, as it had another prominent property in nearby Portglenone, he said. \u201cThe house is a prominent feature on the landscape. The district around it is almost wholly Protestant.\u201d He said he would be \u201cvery pleased if our NI government would accept it as a gift from me\u201d. The government accepted. Macnaghten\u2019s 69-year-old letter was among files from the 1990s recently released by the Public Record Office. Officials studied the letter in 1994 because of plans to sell the estate, which was costly to maintain, and an attempt by Macnaghten\u2019s grandson, Sir Patrick Macnaghten, to claim it. The letter\u2019s sectarianism shocked Graham Thompson, who was a civil servant in the Department of Finance and Personnel. \u201cIt was so blatant,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt really jumped out. It was an insight into how people thought at that time. You would not see such blatant statements written down any more.\u201d Sir Malcolm Macnaghten, the son of a lord, educated at Eton and Cambridge, was a product of the conservative establishment. But progressive politics pervaded his home. He married a daughter of the social reformer Charles Booth and all three of their daughters became socialists. Macnaghten\u2019s hostility to the Catholic church reflected unionist anxiety that the church was aiding the Anti-Partition League, a nationalist movement dedicated to a united Ireland that had its own sectarian figures, said Walker. \u201cThere was this idea that the minority wanted political power and that the minority were disloyal and wanted to destroy the state,\u201d he said. Macnaghten died in 1955. His grandson failed to wrest Runkerry back from the state in the 1990s: the developer Seymour Sweeney bought it and turned it into luxury apartments.",

The last month had been a particularly \u201cemotional\u201d time, said Thomas. \u201cWe get lots of people who feel really ashamed to be here, and lots who are crying, especially mums. When they come to our window they are often so upset.\u201d So far the food bank, which offers an emergency supply to each person in need three times a year, has not had to turn down referrals, but was encouraging people to seek help at other times from one of the other food banks in Preston. But with LuvPreston, one of the biggest in the area, closed for two weeks in August, the demand is unlikely to diminish during the final part of the school holidays.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She and her husband, Jim, were among those voters, and two years of warnings about the consequences of no deal appeared not to have dampened their fervour for leaving.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9e4775f5929b305e2dda2c559f0061f8671002f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9e4775f5929b305e2dda2c559f0061f8671002f/0_318_5561_3336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maureen and Jim Fowler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maureen and Jim Fowler: \u2018They\u2019ve been trying to do to us what they did to Greece, which was basically blackmail.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dr\u0103goi/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Both are retired, having worked in the past in different capacities to service Ford manufacturing, which once employed tens of thousands of workers in east London.

      "body": "<p>When Riya Agarwal moved to the UK from India to study for a master\u2019s in art and interior design at the Royal College of Art, she struggled with homesickness and found London \u201cgloomy and dingy\u201d.</p> <p>As she developed her interior design skills on her course, Agarwal found the best remedy was to decorate her bedroom. \u201cWe\u2019re taught as interior designers to address the mindset and psychology of people who inhabit the space,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She filled her room with calming shades of white and off-white, with a couple of bright colours to create focal points. \u201cLight colours bring lightness to your mind,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>If you\u2019re headed to university this September, that\u2019s probably an effect you\u2019d like your room to have. Agarwal says the best advice is to think about what you want your space to achieve: she wanted to foster a sense of belonging in a new country, but also create a cosy space where she could relax from her intense workload.</p> <p>She filled her room with plants to make her \u201cfeel like somebody is living with you\u201d, and stuck up photos of friends, family and her boyfriend, as well as images of the Hindu god she worships. \u201cThere are times in student life when you feel a little low, and these memories are very important for you to cheer up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f1c332bc3e7436d91edec3a1415e46865e3be0ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1c332bc3e7436d91edec3a1415e46865e3be0ba/0_0_600_900/333.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Shaw, homeware buyer at Urban Outfitters, says wall hangings and tapestries can make your room feel cosy.\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Shaw, homeware buyer at Urban Outfitters, says wall hangings and tapestries can make your room feel cosy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urban Outfitters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Katie Brough, who looks after homeware at Amazon, recommends looking at Instagram for inspiration on how to create a gallery wall filled with comforting photos as well as illustrations or posters. \u201cPicture-frame wall displays are not only on trend, but will be a nice memory of home,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Mismatched sizes and frames in different colours and materials are popular, as is propping differently sized framed images on a shelf \u2013 which means you can switch up what\u2019s on display more easily. Adding shelves to walls can also increase storage but not all university accommodation will allow this, so be sure to ask first.</p> <p>Nicola Shaw, homeware buyer at Urban Outfitters, recommends seeking out textiles to make your room feel homely. \u201cWall hangings, tapestries, duvet sets and rugs are a great way to make a small room feel cosy as well as offering an alternative to changing a carpet or repainting a wall,\u201d she says. \u201cA quirky bathmat and small bathroom accessories can also be a great way to put your stamp on a room without having to spend too much.\u201d</p> <p>How students decorate their rooms is often based on the way they want to use them. Agarwal focused on making her bedroom cosy because she does her university work in the library, but students who prefer working at home might want to make their desk space as comfortable and creatively stimulating as they can.</p> <p>One inexpensive way to help you concentrate on your studies is to move your bed as far from your desk as possible, says Friederike Weid, a recent university graduate who runs a popular interiors Instagram account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ByWxYejIraV/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "When Riya Agarwal moved to the UK from India to study for a master\u2019s in art and interior design at the Royal College of Art, she struggled with homesickness and found London \u201cgloomy and dingy\u201d. As she developed her interior design skills on her course, Agarwal found the best remedy was to decorate her bedroom. \u201cWe\u2019re taught as interior designers to address the mindset and psychology of people who inhabit the space,\u201d she says. She filled her room with calming shades of white and off-white, with a couple of bright colours to create focal points. \u201cLight colours bring lightness to your mind,\u201d she explains. If you\u2019re headed to university this September, that\u2019s probably an effect you\u2019d like your room to have. Agarwal says the best advice is to think about what you want your space to achieve: she wanted to foster a sense of belonging in a new country, but also create a cosy space where she could relax from her intense workload. She filled her room with plants to make her \u201cfeel like somebody is living with you\u201d, and stuck up photos of friends, family and her boyfriend, as well as images of the Hindu god she worships. \u201cThere are times in student life when you feel a little low, and these memories are very important for you to cheer up.\u201d Katie Brough, who looks after homeware at Amazon, recommends looking at Instagram for inspiration on how to create a gallery wall filled with comforting photos as well as illustrations or posters. \u201cPicture-frame wall displays are not only on trend, but will be a nice memory of home,\u201d she says. Mismatched sizes and frames in different colours and materials are popular, as is propping differently sized framed images on a shelf \u2013 which means you can switch up what\u2019s on display more easily. Adding shelves to walls can also increase storage but not all university accommodation will allow this, so be sure to ask first. Nicola Shaw, homeware buyer at Urban Outfitters, recommends seeking out textiles to make your room feel homely. \u201cWall hangings, tapestries, duvet sets and rugs are a great way to make a small room feel cosy as well as offering an alternative to changing a carpet or repainting a wall,\u201d she says. \u201cA quirky bathmat and small bathroom accessories can also be a great way to put your stamp on a room without having to spend too much.\u201d How students decorate their rooms is often based on the way they want to use them. Agarwal focused on making her bedroom cosy because she does her university work in the library, but students who prefer working at home might want to make their desk space as comfortable and creatively stimulating as they can. One inexpensive way to help you concentrate on your studies is to move your bed as far from your desk as possible, says Friederike Weid, a recent university graduate who runs a popular interiors Instagram account. Weid recalls that she filled her room with plants and succulents as a student. \u201cThey keep the air fresh and they make the room more vibrant,\u201d she says. She also recommends natural candles, room fragrances and different lighting around the room to create different atmospheres. But as Brough points out, these aren\u2019t always allowed in halls of residence. \u201c[You can] create ambience with the help of a diffuser,\u201d she suggests. \u201cThese are a great alternative.\u201d To keep you going through long hours of revision, Weid recommends creating a mood board with inspiring phrases, pictures and dried flowers.

      "body": "<p>Intense fighting has broken out between former allies in a battle for control of Yemen\u2019s interim capital, Aden, threatening to open a new front in the war and raising fears for civilians\u2019 safety.</p> <p>Forces loyal to the Yemeni government were hit by airstrikes on Thursday as they travelled towards the southern city, killing at least 30 troops, a government commander said. He did not say who carried out the strikes, but a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is the only party to the four-year-old conflict with airpower.</p> <p>The attack is a major escalation in a three-week struggle for Aden between the Yemeni government and the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is backed by the UAE.</p> <p>Yemen\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Abdullah al-Hadram, said in a tweet that the Yemeni government held the UAE responsible for the \u201cexplicit extra-judicial targeting\u201d, adding that the strikes had also killed several civilians.</p> <p>Officials in the UAE declined to comment.</p> <p>The government and the STC are ostensibly allies in the Saudi-led coalition fighting against Houthi rebels who seized much of north Yemen and the capital, Sana\u2019a, in 2014. The STC\u2019s ultimate goal, however, is independence for the south from what it says is corruption and mismanagement by the government, which it says has ties to Islamists.</p> <p>The rift has also exposed tensions between the coalition members Saudi Arabia, which backs the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and the UAE, which funds and arms the STC and allied militias such as the Security Belt. The UAE has fallen out with Hadi\u2019s side as it includes a party the UAE sees as close to the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Gulf state seeks to neutralise across the Middle East.</p> <p>While both countries reiterated their support for the floundering coalition on Monday, worries are growing over how the new fighting will affect a country where 80% of the population \u2013 more than 24 million people \u2013 rely on aid to survive and 10 million people are on the brink of starvation.</p> <p>\u201cWe were scared that the fighting in Aden would continue for days, but today it has stopped in the city at least,\u201d said Jaclin al-Batani, a local university lecturer.</p> <p>M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said its teams in Aden admitted 51 people in the space of a few hours on Wednesday, 10 of whom were dead on arrival.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s total chaos here,\u201d said Caroline Seguin, MSF\u2019s programme manager for Yemen, who was in Aden. \u201cThere was fighting in the city all day yesterday. Things appear to have calmed down a bit this morning but we expect the hostilities to resume at any point.\u201d</p> <p>The Security Belt militia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/14/scores-killed-in-yemen-as-uae-backed-fighters-seize-parts-of-aden\">seized Aden</a> as well as other cities in the south including Ataq and Zinjibar in three days of fierce fighting that left dozens of people dead this month. Hadi\u2019s government described the offensive as a coup.</p> <p>On Wednesday militias loyal to Hadi said they had regained control of Aden, including the airport and the presidential palace, after a huge push to drive out the separatist fighters. </p> <p>But on Thursday government troops appeared to have withdrawn to neighbouring Abyan province. The Security Belt had regained full control, said an STC spokesperson, Haithan Nezar.</p> <p>\u201cTo whomever said the Southern Resistance has fled, I say: We are here,\u201d STC vice-president Hani Ben Brik said in a video shared on social media which showed him with dozens of fighters outside Aden\u2019s airport.</p> <p>The newest chapter in Yemen\u2019s complex civil war was triggered by the UAE\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/09/yemen-uae-confirms-withdrawal-from-port-city-of-hodeidah\">announcement</a> in July that it would withdraw thousands of troops from the country, shrinking its involvement in the fight against the Iran-backed Houthis.</p> <p>The UAE has denied the timing was linked to rising tensions between the US and Iran over Tehran\u2019s collapsing nuclear deal with world powers. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Intense fighting has broken out between former allies in a battle for control of Yemen\u2019s interim capital, Aden, threatening to open a new front in the war and raising fears for civilians\u2019 safety. Forces loyal to the Yemeni government were hit by airstrikes on Thursday as they travelled towards the southern city, killing at least 30 troops, a government commander said. He did not say who carried out the strikes, but a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is the only party to the four-year-old conflict with airpower. The attack is a major escalation in a three-week struggle for Aden between the Yemeni government and the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is backed by the UAE. Yemen\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Abdullah al-Hadram, said in a tweet that the Yemeni government held the UAE responsible for the \u201cexplicit extra-judicial targeting\u201d, adding that the strikes had also killed several civilians. Officials in the UAE declined to comment. The government and the STC are ostensibly allies in the Saudi-led coalition fighting against Houthi rebels who seized much of north Yemen and the capital, Sana\u2019a, in 2014. The STC\u2019s ultimate goal, however, is independence for the south from what it says is corruption and mismanagement by the government, which it says has ties to Islamists. The rift has also exposed tensions between the coalition members Saudi Arabia, which backs the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and the UAE, which funds and arms the STC and allied militias such as the Security Belt. The UAE has fallen out with Hadi\u2019s side as it includes a party the UAE sees as close to the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Gulf state seeks to neutralise across the Middle East. While both countries reiterated their support for the floundering coalition on Monday, worries are growing over how the new fighting will affect a country where 80% of the population \u2013 more than 24 million people \u2013 rely on aid to survive and 10 million people are on the brink of starvation. \u201cWe were scared that the fighting in Aden would continue for days, but today it has stopped in the city at least,\u201d said Jaclin al-Batani, a local university lecturer. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said its teams in Aden admitted 51 people in the space of a few hours on Wednesday, 10 of whom were dead on arrival. \u201cIt\u2019s total chaos here,\u201d said Caroline Seguin, MSF\u2019s programme manager for Yemen, who was in Aden. \u201cThere was fighting in the city all day yesterday. Things appear to have calmed down a bit this morning but we expect the hostilities to resume at any point.\u201d The Security Belt militia seized Aden as well as other cities in the south including Ataq and Zinjibar in three days of fierce fighting that left dozens of people dead this month. Hadi\u2019s government described the offensive as a coup. On Wednesday militias loyal to Hadi said they had regained control of Aden, including the airport and the presidential palace, after a huge push to drive out the separatist fighters. But on Thursday government troops appeared to have withdrawn to neighbouring Abyan province. The Security Belt had regained full control, said an STC spokesperson, Haithan Nezar. \u201cTo whomever said the Southern Resistance has fled, I say: We are here,\u201d STC vice-president Hani Ben Brik said in a video shared on social media which showed him with dozens of fighters outside Aden\u2019s airport. The newest chapter in Yemen\u2019s complex civil war was triggered by the UAE\u2019s announcement in July that it would withdraw thousands of troops from the country, shrinking its involvement in the fight against the Iran-backed Houthis. The UAE has denied the timing was linked to rising tensions between the US and Iran over Tehran\u2019s collapsing nuclear deal with world powers.",

Once, the strangest aspect of this new release would have been Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s inability to finalise his vision for the film. Now, the weirdest thing is that it took so bloody long.</p> <p>Apocalypse Now waited 40 whole years before returning to cinemas with this new, definitive version. Let\u2019s compare that with Spider-Man: Far From Home, which came out almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 two months ago. An extended version is already <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/spider-man-far-from-home-re-release-new-scene-1203307089/\" title=\"\">about to be released</a>. Same with Midsommar. This also came out in early July, but that won\u2019t stop an <a href=\"https://www.picturehouses.com/cinema/Picturehouse_Central/film/midsommar-directors-cut\" title=\"\">unrated director\u2019s cut</a> from launching next weekend. By these standards Avengers: Endgame is the model of restraint, managing to wait for two months and two days before being theatrically revived with a smattering of new footage.</p> <p>And \u2013 make no mistake \u2013 calling it a smattering is generous. Although it is a little impolite to compare a work as substantial as Apocalypse Now with what basically amounts to a punctuation point in Superheroes: The Soap Opera, Coppola\u2019s Final Cut continues the dramatic reshaping of the film that began with 2001\u2019s sprawling Redux version, whereas the Endgame re-release includes what exactly? Six extra piddling minutes of almost-footage, including a scene where an unfinished Hulk with an immobile mouth rescues some people, a montage of Stan Lee shooting his cameos and the opening scene of Spider-Man: Far From Home. That is it. Two DVD extras and a trailer. That will be the full price of a cinema ticket again, please. Refreshments are available in the foyer.</p> <p>Still, it did the job. The Endgame re-release was a transparently commercial manoeuvre, cynically willed into existence because the original run couldn\u2019t quite squeeze past Avatar to become the highest-grossing film of all time. Chuck in a handful of scraps \u2013 without even integrating them into the film \u2013 in the name of fan service, and bingo: Endgame <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/21/avengers-endgame-tops-avatar-to-be-highest-grossing-film\" title=\"\">just about nosed it</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7956c6e38bf5f7162d106c4e5d51578615eacfc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7956c6e38bf5f7162d106c4e5d51578615eacfc9/0_37_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Midsommar: a re-release that offers a lot more.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Midsommar: a re-release that offers a lot more.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabor Kotschy/A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And where The Avengers go, everyone else follows. The Far From Home re-release (containing an unseen four-minute action scene and three minutes of other fluff) is almost certainly just to squeeze a few more bucks out of the fans. If it works as well as Endgame, it could bump the box office tally up by about $5m, which might be enough to leapfrog the third Lord of the Rings film in the all-time chart.</p> <p>The Midsommar re-release, at least, feels as if someone has spent some actual time on it. The director\u2019s cut is about 25 minutes longer than the version released in June and, according to those who have seen it, provides greater character depth and deeper mythological understanding. Whisper it, but it might actually be a director\u2019s cut in the truest sense of the term. This could actually be the version that Ari Aster wanted to release in the first place.</p> <p>You cannot possibly say that about anything burped out by Marvel. It is impossible to imagine the Russo brothers tossing and turning at night, worrying that audiences might not get to see their complete artistic vision of having Endgame bookended with a 61-second advert for a Spider-Man film.</p> <p>But this is where we are now. Cinemas are having a rough time of it this year, with all manner of \u201ctentpole franchise\u201d sequels \u2013 the films that were only made because they were going to be hits \u2013 flopping enormously. We knew that audiences didn\u2019t want to see smaller indies, or character-driven mid-budget dramas, or anything based on original properties, but now it appears that they don\u2019t even want to watch the big bangy spectacle stuff they\u2019re supposed to like. So what are cinemas supposed to show instead? That\u2019s right, infinitesimally altered versions of the films audiences literally just went to see.</p> <p>We should expect to see this happening more and more now: a blockbuster comes out at the beginning of summer, and then it returns in a slightly different form six weeks later to tide you over until the DVD release. This is certainly going to be the case with all future Marvel films, and probably all Disney and DC films, too. Can\u2019t wait for Wonder Woman 2? Then you\u2019re going to love Wonder Woman 2: The Director\u2019s Cut, featuring a never-before-seen 20-second clip of Gal Gadot inspecting her boot for dog poo.</p> <p>Whether this will last is another question. Audiences are bound to wise up to the outright cynicism of this practice before long. And then what will Hollywood do for money? My guess is that it will keep re-releasing Endgame once a fortnight until the end of time, with a new scrap of unused DVD extra footage bolted on at the start. Why mess with a winning formula?</p>",

Let\u2019s compare that with Spider-Man: Far From Home, which came out almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 two months ago. An extended version is already about to be released. Same with Midsommar. This also came out in early July, but that won\u2019t stop an unrated director\u2019s cut from launching next weekend. By these standards Avengers: Endgame is the model of restraint, managing to wait for two months and two days before being theatrically revived with a smattering of new footage. And \u2013 make no mistake \u2013 calling it a smattering is generous. Although it is a little impolite to compare a work as substantial as Apocalypse Now with what basically amounts to a punctuation point in Superheroes: The Soap Opera, Coppola\u2019s Final Cut continues the dramatic reshaping of the film that began with 2001\u2019s sprawling Redux version, whereas the Endgame re-release includes what exactly? Six extra piddling minutes of almost-footage, including a scene where an unfinished Hulk with an immobile mouth rescues some people, a montage of Stan Lee shooting his cameos and the opening scene of Spider-Man: Far From Home. That is it. Two DVD extras and a trailer. That will be the full price of a cinema ticket again, please. Refreshments are available in the foyer. Still, it did the job. The Endgame re-release was a transparently commercial manoeuvre, cynically willed into existence because the original run couldn\u2019t quite squeeze past Avatar to become the highest-grossing film of all time. Chuck in a handful of scraps \u2013 without even integrating them into the film \u2013 in the name of fan service, and bingo: Endgame just about nosed it. And where The Avengers go, everyone else follows. The Far From Home re-release (containing an unseen four-minute action scene and three minutes of other fluff) is almost certainly just to squeeze a few more bucks out of the fans. If it works as well as Endgame, it could bump the box office tally up by about $5m, which might be enough to leapfrog the third Lord of the Rings film in the all-time chart. The Midsommar re-release, at least, feels as if someone has spent some actual time on it. The director\u2019s cut is about 25 minutes longer than the version released in June and, according to those who have seen it, provides greater character depth and deeper mythological understanding. Whisper it, but it might actually be a director\u2019s cut in the truest sense of the term. This could actually be the version that Ari Aster wanted to release in the first place. You cannot possibly say that about anything burped out by Marvel. It is impossible to imagine the Russo brothers tossing and turning at night, worrying that audiences might not get to see their complete artistic vision of having Endgame bookended with a 61-second advert for a Spider-Man film. But this is where we are now. Cinemas are having a rough time of it this year, with all manner of \u201ctentpole franchise\u201d sequels \u2013 the films that were only made because they were going to be hits \u2013 flopping enormously. We knew that audiences didn\u2019t want to see smaller indies, or character-driven mid-budget dramas, or anything based on original properties, but now it appears that they don\u2019t even want to watch the big bangy spectacle stuff they\u2019re supposed to like. So what are cinemas supposed to show instead? That\u2019s right, infinitesimally altered versions of the films audiences literally just went to see. We should expect to see this happening more and more now: a blockbuster comes out at the beginning of summer, and then it returns in a slightly different form six weeks later to tide you over until the DVD release. This is certainly going to be the case with all future Marvel films, and probably all Disney and DC films, too. Can\u2019t wait for Wonder Woman 2? Then you\u2019re going to love Wonder Woman 2: The Director\u2019s Cut, featuring a never-before-seen 20-second clip of Gal Gadot inspecting her boot for dog poo. Whether this will last is another question. Audiences are bound to wise up to the outright cynicism of this practice before long. And then what will Hollywood do for money? My guess is that it will keep re-releasing Endgame once a fortnight until the end of time, with a new scrap of unused DVD extra footage bolted on at the start. Why mess with a winning formula?",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s rare a sporting moment makes you shake. Last Sunday, while Ben Stokes was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/australia-ashes-england-third-test-ben-stokes-sensational\" title=\"\">carving Australia to all parts of Headingley</a>, I was in a park watching on my phone. As Nathan Lyon failed to collect the ball cleanly as Jack Leach wandered about in no man\u2019s land I realised I had lost control of my body. The screen was all over the place.</p> \n<p>It might have happened before \u2013 but I\u2019m rarely holding both sides of my TV at those critical moments. My scream of terror was too loud for the sunbathers. I think everyone just thought I was that park\u2019s weird guy on the bench. There\u2019s always one.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/29/england-ashes-jimmy-anderson-jason-roy-ben-stokes-cricket\">England\u2019s Ashes puzzles: what to do about Anderson, Roy \u2013 and Stokes | Tim de Lisle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Leach\u2019s explanation of becoming an instant cult hero is pretty perfect. \u201cIt\u2019s probably because I look like a village cricketer out there in my glasses, the bald head and maybe people think: \u2018That could be me!\u2019 All the others look pretty professional.\u201d</p> \n<p>You can imagine his spectacles and grubby cloth being valued at thousands by a big-haired expert on the 2119 series of the Antiques Roadshow standing next to the cryogenically thawed head of Fiona Bruce. \u201cSo lucky you\u2019ve got both! Yes these belonged to a man called Jack Leach, who played something called Test cricket \u2013 an old version of the 10-ball challenge we have today. Unbelievably he managed to achieve something sporting despite the fact that he wore these things called glasses. You\u2019ll remember they were phased out late in the 21st century.\u201d</p> \n<p>Since Leach\u2019s exploits, there have been interviews with his optometrist and various lists have done the rounds of bespectacled sports stars \u2013 always featuring the hapless ones that fit the narrative, with Eddie the Eagle at the top. One man who rarely reaches the top 10 of that list is Hughie Teape. Yet for some unknown reason the British high hurdler is etched in my sporting memory. Big glasses, and an Eric Young sized headband \u2013 he always seemed to be in lane one while Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett fought it out in the middle for the medals. My 10-year-old brain couldn\u2019t quite compute that coming last in an Olympic final is an extraordinary achievement. He was just the slow guy on the end who couldn\u2019t see very well.</p> \n<p>From birth we are conditioned to see glasses as the preserve of the brainy but physically weak. In film it\u2019s always a lensed asthmatic who is the first to get picked off by the enemy \u2013 whether it\u2019s the first world war, or an alien invasion. He\u2019s the bumbling evil hacker in Jurassic Park who loses his specs in the storm and can\u2019t see the sweet little dinosaur turning into a devastatingly colourful killer. They even tried to soften Arnold Schwarzenegger with them \u2013 off for Predator, on for Junior \u2013 you\u2019re having a baby \u2013 off again, you\u2019re an Expendable.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e237cd533946341dc90bea2728f28552d2cc8a76\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e237cd533946341dc90bea2728f28552d2cc8a76/0_104_4440_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Stokes watches anxiously as Jack Leach faces a Pat Cummins delivery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes watches anxiously as Jack Leach faces a Pat Cummins delivery.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And the nerdy bit might actually be true. A study by Edinburgh University showed participants who wore glasses were approximately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/30/glasses-smarter-study-intelligence-bad-eyesight-link-health-benefits\" title=\"\">30% more likely to be intelligent</a> \u2013 a point perhaps proved by my perfect eyesight\u2019s complete inability to understand any of the report.</p> \n<p>The alternative study into the correlation between sporting weakness and shortsightedness doesn\u2019t seem to have been done. And with good reason. Edwin Moses hurdled passed everyone for years. Martina Navratilova and Billie Jean King dominated tennis. Daniel Vettori is one of New Zealand\u2019s greatest ever cricketers. And it\u2019s not about glasses, either. Your contact-lens six-a\u2011side team is pretty good. De Gea in goal, with Schweinsteiger in front of Thuram and Boateng \u2013 Kak\u00e1 and Cristiano Ronaldo up front.</p> \n<p>And I am not here waving a flag for slight visual impairment. As a BBC local radio reporter I once had an eye test as part of a story I can only presume was about eye tests. After identifying the tiny mix of consonants and vowels from a quarter of a mile away, the optician announced I had \u201cbetter than 20-20 vision\u201d and that I could be a fighter pilot if I so wished. No lover of flying or war, it wasn\u2019t the path for me, but being able to see things clearly was not the thing that stopped me becoming a professional sportsman.</p> \n<p>Apparently 20/10 vision is better than 20/20. Either way, Jack Leach has neither, and bizarrely that is partly why his partnership with Stokes was so glorious.</p> \n<p>In Stokes and Leach you have the two ends of the sporting spectrum \u2013 the super-human and the human. The biological optimum and the guy who looks like a competition winner. Clearly this does Leach a huge disservice but if we analyse why we love sport, appreciating both of these figures is a huge part of it.</p> \n<p>No amount of net sessions, press\u2011ups or protein shakes would give any of us the ability of Stokes. He is a sports star for us to observe in awe. He is Michael Johnson or Serena Williams. He is Steve Smith. Combining that eye, that strength and that indefatigable will to carry on, even when he\u2019s so obviously shattered, takes him beyond normal comparisons.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1c0952ff-cd0d-408d-bb5f-5e04e51ed7aa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6XaZqporLV8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile the narrative for Leach \u2013 however incorrect \u2013 is that he is you and me, trudging about in ill-fitting gear he\u2019s borrowed from a mate, cleaning his steamed-up glasses. He joins that list of unlikely looking spin bowlers \u2013 Panesar, Tufnell, Such.</p> \n<p>We\u2019ve all had that debate about how good we could have become at spin bowling if that\u2019s all we\u2019d done since we were 10 \u2013 forget clarinet lessons and GCSE geography, I\u2019m perfecting the arm ball. Chances are most of us would be nowhere nearer a central contract and considerably further away from any other achievement. But Leach gives us that ludicrous fake spark of hope that at some point in another life we too could have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/26/jack-leach-cult-hero-ashes-cricket\" title=\"\">flicked that single off our hips</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The truth for all these athletes is far less interesting. The most natural, mercurial talents work hard, and the most \u201cnormal\u201d have natural talent. But Leach is a sports star who doesn\u2019t look like a sports star. How glorious that in between the Ireland game and his recall at Lord\u2019s he went back and played for his local side, Taunton Deane \u2013 and came on as third change. Every interview and every quote makes him more likable.</p> \n<p>It will be someone else\u2019s time at Old Trafford. But for now \u2013 in a week when there has been lots to mourn as a sports lover \u2013 let\u2019s revel in one of us taking almost centre stage, however poor their eyesight, and however much better than us they really are.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s rare a sporting moment makes you shake. Last Sunday, while Ben Stokes was carving Australia to all parts of Headingley, I was in a park watching on my phone. As Nathan Lyon failed to collect the ball cleanly as Jack Leach wandered about in no man\u2019s land I realised I had lost control of my body. The screen was all over the place. It might have happened before \u2013 but I\u2019m rarely holding both sides of my TV at those critical moments. My scream of terror was too loud for the sunbathers. I think everyone just thought I was that park\u2019s weird guy on the bench. There\u2019s always one. Leach\u2019s explanation of becoming an instant cult hero is pretty perfect. \u201cIt\u2019s probably because I look like a village cricketer out there in my glasses, the bald head and maybe people think: \u2018That could be me!\u2019 All the others look pretty professional.\u201d You can imagine his spectacles and grubby cloth being valued at thousands by a big-haired expert on the 2119 series of the Antiques Roadshow standing next to the cryogenically thawed head of Fiona Bruce. \u201cSo lucky you\u2019ve got both! Yes these belonged to a man called Jack Leach, who played something called Test cricket \u2013 an old version of the 10-ball challenge we have today. Unbelievably he managed to achieve something sporting despite the fact that he wore these things called glasses. You\u2019ll remember they were phased out late in the 21st century.\u201d Since Leach\u2019s exploits, there have been interviews with his optometrist and various lists have done the rounds of bespectacled sports stars \u2013 always featuring the hapless ones that fit the narrative, with Eddie the Eagle at the top. One man who rarely reaches the top 10 of that list is Hughie Teape. Yet for some unknown reason the British high hurdler is etched in my sporting memory. Big glasses, and an Eric Young sized headband \u2013 he always seemed to be in lane one while Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett fought it out in the middle for the medals. My 10-year-old brain couldn\u2019t quite compute that coming last in an Olympic final is an extraordinary achievement. He was just the slow guy on the end who couldn\u2019t see very well. From birth we are conditioned to see glasses as the preserve of the brainy but physically weak. In film it\u2019s always a lensed asthmatic who is the first to get picked off by the enemy \u2013 whether it\u2019s the first world war, or an alien invasion. He\u2019s the bumbling evil hacker in Jurassic Park who loses his specs in the storm and can\u2019t see the sweet little dinosaur turning into a devastatingly colourful killer. They even tried to soften Arnold Schwarzenegger with them \u2013 off for Predator, on for Junior \u2013 you\u2019re having a baby \u2013 off again, you\u2019re an Expendable. And the nerdy bit might actually be true. A study by Edinburgh University showed participants who wore glasses were approximately 30% more likely to be intelligent \u2013 a point perhaps proved by my perfect eyesight\u2019s complete inability to understand any of the report. The alternative study into the correlation between sporting weakness and shortsightedness doesn\u2019t seem to have been done. And with good reason. Edwin Moses hurdled passed everyone for years. Martina Navratilova and Billie Jean King dominated tennis. Daniel Vettori is one of New Zealand\u2019s greatest ever cricketers. And it\u2019s not about glasses, either. Your contact-lens six-a\u2011side team is pretty good. De Gea in goal, with Schweinsteiger in front of Thuram and Boateng \u2013 Kak\u00e1 and Cristiano Ronaldo up front. And I am not here waving a flag for slight visual impairment. As a BBC local radio reporter I once had an eye test as part of a story I can only presume was about eye tests. After identifying the tiny mix of consonants and vowels from a quarter of a mile away, the optician announced I had \u201cbetter than 20-20 vision\u201d and that I could be a fighter pilot if I so wished. No lover of flying or war, it wasn\u2019t the path for me, but being able to see things clearly was not the thing that stopped me becoming a professional sportsman. Apparently 20/10 vision is better than 20/20. Either way, Jack Leach has neither, and bizarrely that is partly why his partnership with Stokes was so glorious. In Stokes and Leach you have the two ends of the sporting spectrum \u2013 the super-human and the human. The biological optimum and the guy who looks like a competition winner. Clearly this does Leach a huge disservice but if we analyse why we love sport, appreciating both of these figures is a huge part of it. No amount of net sessions, press\u2011ups or protein shakes would give any of us the ability of Stokes. He is a sports star for us to observe in awe. He is Michael Johnson or Serena Williams. He is Steve Smith. Combining that eye, that strength and that indefatigable will to carry on, even when he\u2019s so obviously shattered, takes him beyond normal comparisons. Meanwhile the narrative for Leach \u2013 however incorrect \u2013 is that he is you and me, trudging about in ill-fitting gear he\u2019s borrowed from a mate, cleaning his steamed-up glasses. He joins that list of unlikely looking spin bowlers \u2013 Panesar, Tufnell, Such. We\u2019ve all had that debate about how good we could have become at spin bowling if that\u2019s all we\u2019d done since we were 10 \u2013 forget clarinet lessons and GCSE geography, I\u2019m perfecting the arm ball. Chances are most of us would be nowhere nearer a central contract and considerably further away from any other achievement. But Leach gives us that ludicrous fake spark of hope that at some point in another life we too could have flicked that single off our hips. The truth for all these athletes is far less interesting. The most natural, mercurial talents work hard, and the most \u201cnormal\u201d have natural talent. But Leach is a sports star who doesn\u2019t look like a sports star. How glorious that in between the Ireland game and his recall at Lord\u2019s he went back and played for his local side, Taunton Deane \u2013 and came on as third change. Every interview and every quote makes him more likable. It will be someone else\u2019s time at Old Trafford. But for now \u2013 in a week when there has been lots to mourn as a sports lover \u2013 let\u2019s revel in one of us taking almost centre stage, however poor their eyesight, and however much better than us they really are.",

      "bodyText": "The resignation of a Scottish Tory leader does not tend to be seismic political news. I doubt, for instance, many people south of the border could recall the name of the last woman to stand down from this post eight years ago. Yet Ruth Davidson has always been different, from her personal story to her style of politics \u2013 and this is why her decision to step back from the frontline has such immense significance for both the Conservative party and the future of the union. Davidson was a breath of fresh air after taking over the post from the doughty Annabel Goldie, narrowly grabbing the leadership just months after becoming an MSP. She quickly attracted attention as someone who was charming, pugnacious and unusually witty for a politician, seemingly content in her own skin, comfortable on social media, and unconcerned about exposing personal contradictions as a gay, Christian, Tory promoting her party in a place where the brand had become poison. She was seen as an embodiment of David Cameron\u2019s flawed modernisation efforts. Yet Davidson is a mixture of liberalism on issues such as migration and social mores, combined with more traditional Tory views on crime, punishment and, above all, protection of the union. She won respect by dragging her party back from the graveside, beating Labour into third place in Scottish parliamentary elections before saving Theresa May\u2019s skin with 13 Tory MPs in the 2017 election debacle. But thanks to the ongoing ruptures of Brexit and the party\u2019s capture by zealots under the charlatan-in-chief Boris Johnson, all her efforts are likely to be ruined.

      "body": "<p>Gareth Southgate has insisted Kyle Walker\u2019s England career is not over despite the Manchester City defender being left out of the squad to face Bulgaria and Kosovo in favour of Aaron Wan-Bissaka.</p> \n<p>Wan-Bissaka is in the senior squad for the first time since moving to Manchester United in the summer and is joined by the Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings for the Euro 2020 qualifiers at Wembley on Saturday 7 September and Southampton three days later. Recalls for Chelsea\u2019s Mason Mount and James Maddison of Leicester take the number of uncapped players to four.</p> \n<p>There is a return for Liverpool\u2019s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after his comeback from injury \u2013 the first time since March 2018 that the midfielder has been included.</p> \n<p>The omission of Walker, a mainstay of the side that reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup, raised most eyebrows, with the England manager explaining that he had left out the 29-year-old right-back to take a closer look at Wan-Bissaka and Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout getting Trent\u2019s head too big, too quickly, he\u2019s got to be one of those we look to integrate and give more opportunity to,\u201d Southgate said.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s a bit like at a club \u2013 if we don\u2019t make a pathway, then when are you ever going to put them in? With Aaron, [we\u2019ve got] a completely different kind of player, so we\u2019ve got Trips [Kieran Trippier] as a bit of cover around that and there\u2019s no point bringing Kyle in if the intention is not to start him in the games.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cHe\u2019s a senior player and he\u2019ll value the rest and recovery as much as anything else.

      "bodyText": "Gareth Southgate has insisted Kyle Walker\u2019s England career is not over despite the Manchester City defender being left out of the squad to face Bulgaria and Kosovo in favour of Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Wan-Bissaka is in the senior squad for the first time since moving to Manchester United in the summer and is joined by the Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings for the Euro 2020 qualifiers at Wembley on Saturday 7 September and Southampton three days later. Recalls for Chelsea\u2019s Mason Mount and James Maddison of Leicester take the number of uncapped players to four. There is a return for Liverpool\u2019s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after his comeback from injury \u2013 the first time since March 2018 that the midfielder has been included. The omission of Walker, a mainstay of the side that reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup, raised most eyebrows, with the England manager explaining that he had left out the 29-year-old right-back to take a closer look at Wan-Bissaka and Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold. \u201cWithout getting Trent\u2019s head too big, too quickly, he\u2019s got to be one of those we look to integrate and give more opportunity to,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a bit like at a club \u2013 if we don\u2019t make a pathway, then when are you ever going to put them in? With Aaron, [we\u2019ve got] a completely different kind of player, so we\u2019ve got Trips [Kieran Trippier] as a bit of cover around that and there\u2019s no point bringing Kyle in if the intention is not to start him in the games.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s a senior player and he\u2019ll value the rest and recovery as much as anything else. But we could be in a different space in four weeks\u2019 time because he\u2019s started the season very well, he\u2019s got competition for his place at his club and we\u2019ve got that here. It\u2019s a unique position to have four that are of a very high level, but two young ones as well. Probably two years ago, we waited until we had qualified and then evolved. I think during the Nations League we did it as we were going along and we think that\u2019s the right route to go.\u201d Southgate was adamant Walker understood the reasons behind his omission and that the selection of Trippier and Wan-Bissaka did not necessarily mean they had moved ahead in the pecking order. \u201cIt depends on how well everybody does,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have not said to Kyle that that\u2019s it.\u201d Maddison\u2019s return after he was first called up along with Mount for the Nations League matches against Croatia and Spain last year is reward for his form since a disappointing summer with England Under-21s, when Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s side were eliminated in the group stages of the European Championship. Wan-Bissaka was also in that squad and Southgate said they must learn from their experiences in Italy. \u201cThey had some good moments and some not so good moments, but that\u2019s the development in football,\u201d he said.

There are those of us who welcome you and those who do not because you have landed in two places, a place being born and a place dying, noisily, violently, with as much damage as possible.</p> \n<p>It has always been two places, since the earliest Europeans arrived in places where Native people already lived, and pretended they were new and gave them the wrong names. You can tell the history of the United States \u2013 which are not very united now \u2013 as the history of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth\">Sojourner Truth</a>, the heroine who helped liberate the enslaved, as that of the slaveowners and defenders of slavery, as a place of visionary environmental voices such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-anniversary\">Rachel Carson</a> and the corporate powers and profiteers she fought and exposed.</p> \n<p>Right now the US is the country of Donald Trump and of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of climate destroyers and climate protectors.

Something has changed, thanks to you and to the young people who have brought new urgency and vision to the climate movement. Many people have become concerned and awake for the first time, and the conversation we need to have is opening up. People are ready for change, or some of us are. This is what\u2019s being born in the US and around the world: not only new energy systems, but new social systems with more room for the voices of those who are not white or male or straight or neurotypical.</p> \n<p>The old energy system was about centralized control and the malevolent power of Gazprom and BP, Shell and Chevron, and the governments warped into serving them rather than humanity. The new system must not only be about localized energy, but democratized decision-making, about the rights of nature and the rights of the vulnerable and the future, over profit.</p> \n<p>Some of this is already here: not only the larger groups you\u2019re surely heard of \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.sunrisemovement.org/\">Sunrise Movement</a>, <a href=\"https://350.org/\">350.org</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/\">Sierra Club</a>, <a href=\"https://act.ran.org/page/11068/donate/1?gclid=Cj0KCQjw753rBRCVARIsANe3o46_t9txNOHQi-2vJ1zhj1iscP7yxcDynmCAh8hc50QGx9lbgguN28YaAq8kEALw_wcB\">Rainforest Action Network</a> \u2013 but countless local and tribal groups that have arisen to stop this pipeline or that coal port or these fracking projects, to protect this forest or this mountain or these waters. They are not visible the way the United Nations or the US Congress or European Union is, but their work matters, and perhaps we will build a lot of this transition out from below \u2013 but we need the big policy agendas set from above as well.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/26/energy-renewable-electricity-coal-power\">US generates more electricity from renewables than coal for first time ever</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Everywhere I see remarkable things happening.

      "bodyText": "Dear Greta, Thank you for travelling across the Atlantic to north America to help us do the most important work in the world. There are those of us who welcome you and those who do not because you have landed in two places, a place being born and a place dying, noisily, violently, with as much damage as possible. It has always been two places, since the earliest Europeans arrived in places where Native people already lived, and pretended they were new and gave them the wrong names. You can tell the history of the United States \u2013 which are not very united now \u2013 as the history of Sojourner Truth, the heroine who helped liberate the enslaved, as that of the slaveowners and defenders of slavery, as a place of visionary environmental voices such as Rachel Carson and the corporate powers and profiteers she fought and exposed. Right now the US is the country of Donald Trump and of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of climate destroyers and climate protectors. Sometimes the Truths and the Carsons have won. I believe it is more than possible for Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal to win, for the spirit of generosity and inclusion and the protection of nature to win \u2013 but that depends on what we do now. Which is why I\u2019m so grateful that you have arrived to galvanize us with your clarity of vision and passionate commitment. Not long ago I talked to a powerful climate organizer who began her work when she was only a little older than you, and she told me that her hope right now is that people recognize that this is a moment of great possibility, of openings and momentum, and a growing alarm and commitment to what the changing climate requires of us. Something has changed, thanks to you and to the young people who have brought new urgency and vision to the climate movement. Many people have become concerned and awake for the first time, and the conversation we need to have is opening up. People are ready for change, or some of us are. This is what\u2019s being born in the US and around the world: not only new energy systems, but new social systems with more room for the voices of those who are not white or male or straight or neurotypical. The old energy system was about centralized control and the malevolent power of Gazprom and BP, Shell and Chevron, and the governments warped into serving them rather than humanity. The new system must not only be about localized energy, but democratized decision-making, about the rights of nature and the rights of the vulnerable and the future, over profit. Some of this is already here: not only the larger groups you\u2019re surely heard of \u2013 the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network \u2013 but countless local and tribal groups that have arisen to stop this pipeline or that coal port or these fracking projects, to protect this forest or this mountain or these waters. They are not visible the way the United Nations or the US Congress or European Union is, but their work matters, and perhaps we will build a lot of this transition out from below \u2013 but we need the big policy agendas set from above as well. Everywhere I see remarkable things happening. No matter how much you see of this big country, this huge continent, there is more than you can see. I hope you have a chance to see some of the beauty of the American landscapes, from rainforests to deserts; there is also beauty in the passionate commitment around the country. Coalminers in Kentucky have been blocking a coal train track for a month, because their bankrupt company stiffed them on wages, and coalminers elsewhere recently spoke to this newspaper about their clarity that coal is over and that the Green New Deal and its jobs are welcome.

The Amazon is burning because of one rightwing leader and a system that rewards agricultural products but not forest protection, even though we need rainforests more than we need the soybeans and beef raised on the land stolen from the rainforest and its indigenous inhabitants. I\u2019ve mentioned a bit of what is going on in my troubled, complicated country, the US, but of course these are global conflicts and global situations, and the solutions are advancing almost everywhere, because they are good solutions to terrible problems.

At the same time, the Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin began the equally slow and difficult business of turning a war-weary country to face the new threat of Nazism \u2013 only to be accused of facing the same choice as MacDonald but taking the other decision: putting his party ahead of the country. Baldwin felt rearmament could go no faster than voters in general and Tories in particular were ready to accept. Churchill, his career floundering, infamously and dishonestly accused him of delaying rearmament in order to win the 1935 election. Yet for all the emotive power of the question, the truth is that this party-or-country thing is a false dichotomy, a piece of sham political rhetoric. The state of the parties themselves \u2013 divided, angry, argumentative \u2013 adds a new twist. Politics is dominated by zombie parties, sustained only by an antiquated first-past-the-post system that massively favours the status quo. The old pressure to remain a broad church, to tolerate difference, has withered. The matching obligation, for members to believe that however pathetic or dangerous or wrong the leadership, the party is more important, has dwindled too. Referendums may have a lot to answer for. In the decade Britain joined the common market, voters fell out of love with parties. At the start of the 1970s, about half of voters still claimed to have \u201cvery strong\u201d party loyalty. By the end it was only a quarter. The affair that flourished when universal suffrage was young and mass party membership a novelty was over, and the romance has never been rekindled. For two generations now, since Thatcher became Tory leader in 1975, the electorally successful leaders of both main parties have governed not with their party but against it. At the same time, neglected by the leadership, parties have too often fallen into the hands of factions. The old answer was to stay and fight, to rebuild from the inside. For many MPs today that must feel like an impossible dream. It is typical that Davidson, a woman who seemed to offer a fresh, appealing political voice for Scottish Conservatism, has judged her departure shrewdly. She has resigned from the leadership, but not yet from her party. Scottish Tories can still hope. \u2022 Anne Perkins is a writer and broadcaster, and former Guardian correspondent",

His father, who had fought in the first world war at Mons and the Somme, struggled untrained to run a farm. The venture failed and the family battled with recurrent unemployment through the 1930s.</p> <p>Don won a scholarship to Harrow grammar school and gained a first-class degree in mathematics at King\u2019s College London. In 1945 he was drafted into secret work on radar at the Telecommunications Research Establishment, Great Malvern. Two years later he became a teacher at Downer grammar school, Harrow; from there he moved to Chiswick grammar, and then on to the BBC.</p> <p>A bold but careful planner, he was a shrewd judge of people and their potential, and a wily operator within the bureaucracies of the BBC and other organisations. Grattan could seem remote to those very junior to him, but was in fact warm and supportive, delighted to back initiatives that he saw as brave and imaginative. Perhaps because of the straitened circumstances of his childhood, he believed deeply in the social value of education.</p> <p>After leaving the BBC in 1984, he became a sought-after adviser in the UK, the Commonwealth and elsewhere, in particular Iran, Indonesia and China. He chaired the National Council for Educational Technology and the Unit for the Development of Adult Continuing Education. The OU awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1985. Contributing to the educational work of the European Broadcasting Union made him many friends in that world and in 1989 he was appointed CBE.</p> <p>In retirement, living in Marlow, in the Thames Valley, Grattan became a courteous eco-warrior, tussling with officials of the Highways Agency on such matters as noisy road surfaces \u2013 his knowledge of physics and civil engineering made him a formidable opponent.</p> <p>At home he was a welcoming and generous host and, as visitors discovered, a crafty croquet player. </p> <p>In 1950 he married Valmai Morgan; she died in May this year. He is survived by their children, David and Jennifer, seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Donald Henry Grattan, broadcaster and educator, born 7 August 1926; died 21 August 2019</p>",

The On the Move peak-time series with Bob Hoskins (1975-76) was targeted towards the millions of adults concealing difficulties with reading and writing. National help and advice lines were pioneered. The BBC Micro, which started a revolution in computing, was conceived and brought to the nation in the early 1980s. Born in St Osyth, near Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, Don was the son of Edith (nee Saltmarsh) and Arthur Grattan. His father, who had fought in the first world war at Mons and the Somme, struggled untrained to run a farm. The venture failed and the family battled with recurrent unemployment through the 1930s. Don won a scholarship to Harrow grammar school and gained a first-class degree in mathematics at King\u2019s College London. In 1945 he was drafted into secret work on radar at the Telecommunications Research Establishment, Great Malvern. Two years later he became a teacher at Downer grammar school, Harrow; from there he moved to Chiswick grammar, and then on to the BBC. A bold but careful planner, he was a shrewd judge of people and their potential, and a wily operator within the bureaucracies of the BBC and other organisations. Grattan could seem remote to those very junior to him, but was in fact warm and supportive, delighted to back initiatives that he saw as brave and imaginative. Perhaps because of the straitened circumstances of his childhood, he believed deeply in the social value of education. After leaving the BBC in 1984, he became a sought-after adviser in the UK, the Commonwealth and elsewhere, in particular Iran, Indonesia and China. He chaired the National Council for Educational Technology and the Unit for the Development of Adult Continuing Education. The OU awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1985. Contributing to the educational work of the European Broadcasting Union made him many friends in that world and in 1989 he was appointed CBE. In retirement, living in Marlow, in the Thames Valley, Grattan became a courteous eco-warrior, tussling with officials of the Highways Agency on such matters as noisy road surfaces \u2013 his knowledge of physics and civil engineering made him a formidable opponent. At home he was a welcoming and generous host and, as visitors discovered, a crafty croquet player. In 1950 he married Valmai Morgan; she died in May this year. He is survived by their children, David and Jennifer, seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. \u2022 Donald Henry Grattan, broadcaster and educator, born 7 August 1926; died 21 August 2019",

This introduces us to Kamala (voiced by Cyli Khare), who works as a dancer at an illegal nightclub while planning to sell herself into marriage in Dubai, before informing us that wait, she\u2019s only doing this to provide for her younger sister Tara and her disabled grandfather, who works as a watchmaker but isn\u2019t getting much trade.

There\u2019s also a cat that likes to wander the streets at night, watching the ghosts who dance inside the cemetery, and Mrs D\u2019Souza (Amardeep Jha), an eccentric old actor who longs to be visited by a ghost of her own. If Bombay Rose doesn\u2019t quite boast a cast of thousands, this can only be because Rao\u2019s hand finally cramped up from drawing.</p> <p>Every now and then, Mrs D\u2019Souza gives private lessons to Tara. When she\u2019s not teaching the girl English, she\u2019s schooling her in her colours, explaining the difference between red and crimson, purple and carmine. And this feels appropriate since Rao\u2019s film appears captivated by colours, so drunk on its palette of turmeric oranges and primrose pinks that it eventually succumbs to a kind of Dutch courage and starts throwing in fantasy sequences involving flying horses and a talking bird. Bombay Rose works best when it keeps its feet on the ground, when it thrums to the sound of Mumbai street noise and keeps obscuring its characters with passing trucks and bicycles. The talking bird, on reflection, is a flight of fancy too far.</p> <p>Then again, Mrs D\u2019Souza was once a Bollywood star, swooningly romantic in the high old style, and perhaps Rao\u2019s animation takes its lead from that. Bombay Rose\u2019s high-stakes melodrama might be ripped from the real world, but it has been powdered and perfumed \u2013 crammed full of archetypes and over-egged emotions, liberally sprinkled with musical interludes.

      "bodyText": "Four days of strikes are due to bring disruption and delays for thousands of commuters on one of Britain\u2019s busiest train services, South Western Railway. More than 40% of services on the network will not run on Friday and Monday, and only half of all scheduled trains will run at the weekend, when engineering works will also affect some services. South Western Railway serves an average of 600,000 passenger journeys daily on lines between London Waterloo and regions including Surrey and Hampshire. The strike by members of the RMT union is the latest in a long-running dispute over the future roles and responsibilities of guards on trains. South Western said it had offered to keep a guard on every train \u201cas part of a framework agreement\u201d, but it wanted \u201cto move the conversation on to how we operate our new trains and take advantage of the new technology onboard to benefit our customers\u201d. It said the remaining services were likely be busier than usual during the strike. Engineering works at the weekend will also mean fewer trains in south-west London on Sunday. The RMT has accused the firm of \u201ctrying to mug off staff\u201d by failing to give firm assurances over guards during talks. It said clauses in the franchise contract that protect South Western in the event of strikes could mean the operator had received up to \u00a332m from the taxpayer. According to filings from First Group, which runs South Western in conjunction with MTR, negotiations with the Department for Transport have progressed to recover \u201cstrike amelioration\u201d, although the government has not confirmed the amounts, citing commercial confidentiality. The RMT said its \u00a332m estimate was the equivalent of a 3.4% fare cut for South Western passengers. The general secretary, Mick Cash, who was re-elected this week for a further five-year term leading the union, said: \u201cPassengers will be outraged to know that South Western Railway will be paid by ministers even when they don\u2019t run trains on strike days. South Western don\u2019t lose a penny from strikes and therefore have little incentive to negotiate seriously.\u201d The union will also stage strikes on Merseyrail next month in a parallel dispute over guards on trains.",

      "body": "<h2>22. Take Away (2001)</h2> \n<p>A ballad from the album Miss E \u2026 So Addictive, enlivened by its off-kilter rhythm and queasy-sounding sample, retooled as a tribute to Elliott\u2019s late friend and collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/feb/26/10-of-the-best-90s-r-and-b\" title=\"\">Aaliyah</a>. While the lyrics sort of fit their new purpose, the accompanying video bizarrely concludes with a version of party anthem 4 My People, apparently intended as Elliott\u2019s comment on 9/11.</p> \n<h2>21. Teary Eyed (2005)</h2> \n<p>A relative flop after a string of hits, perhaps because it abandoned the frenetic futurism of her most famous singles in favour of straight-up retro R&amp;B. Teary Eyed offered further proof that Elliott could really sing and packed a decent chorus without causing the seismic thrills of Lose Control or Work It.</p> \n<h2>20. I\u2019m Better (2017)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9cb4081ea0c2699c46d9d23a73ec9a495da863fe\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cb4081ea0c2699c46d9d23a73ec9a495da863fe/0_39_7508_4506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Missy Elliott at the MTV VMAs in Newark this week, where she was awarded the Michael Jackson video vanguard award.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Missy Elliott at the MTV VMAs in Newark this week, where she was awarded the Michael Jackson video vanguard award.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DJ Johnson/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I\u2019m Better arrived 20 years after Elliott\u2019s debut single \u2013 an eternity in hip-hop \u2013 and found her paying lip service to current trends: a trap-influenced beat, a hint of slurred vowels about her delivery, lyrical references to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bando\" title=\"\">the bando</a>\u201d. Less innovative than her biggest hits, it is still home to some sharp lines: \u201cMissy talk big I\u2019m so grande \u2026 I just rant like I\u2019m Kanye.\u201d</p> \n<h2>19. Beep Me 911 (1998)</h2> \n<p>A heartbroken R&amp;B slow jam \u2013 featuring dimly remembered trio <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/702_(group)\" title=\"\">702</a>, for whom a pre-fame Elliott wrote songs \u2013 rendered into something alien-sounding: the rhythm stammers and never settles; the instruments sound slightly off-key; and Elliott\u2019s voice floats ethereally over the top, lending its saga of a collapsing relationship a blank-eyed, disaffected air.</p> \n<h2>18. 4 My People (2002)</h2> \n<p>A paean to hip-hop\u2019s belated discovery of MDMA \u2013 \u201cI wanna dance and lick your face,\u201d offers Elliott, while guest vocalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/19/eve-i-thought-of-rap-as-a-sisterhood-it-was-not-like-that\" title=\"\">Eve</a> bemoans the ecstasy user\u2019s perennial bugbear, drunks spoiling the vibe \u2013 4 My People\u2019s four-to-the-floor house beat has an authentically sweaty, wild-eyed quality, vastly superior to hip-hop\u2019s subsequent dabblings in shiny pop-house.</p> \n<h2>17. Sock It 2 Me (1997)</h2> \n<p>There is a boldness to Sock It 2 Me \u2013 which is based on a sample from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onp73T-bWzg\" title=\"\">the Delfonics\u2019 Ready Or Not Here I Come</a>, a song the world should have had its fill of following the Fugees\u2019 chart-topping cover the previous year. But producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/may/14/timbaland-10-of-the-best\" title=\"\">Timbaland</a> warps the sample into a strange, disjointed new shape; Missy sings and Da Brat offers a warp-speed guest appearance.</p> \n<h2>16. All N My Grill (1999)</h2> \n<p>Missy back in warped R&amp;B mode \u2013 a smart, witty take on the standard no-romance-without-finance lyric (\u201cTalk is talk and talk is cheap / Tell it to her, don\u2019t say it to me\u201d), further brightened by the appearance of Outkast\u2019s Big Boi, who goes from rapping about lingerie to issuing threats in archaic English (\u201cI will jab thee and stab thee\u201d).</p> \n<h2>15. One Minute Man (2001)</h2> \n<p>The brilliance of Missy Elliott\u2019s exploration of the topic of premature ejaculation (spoiler: she is not terribly sympathetic) lies in the weirdness of its structure, at least in the version from the video. A minute before the end, it turns into a completely new track, dropping the G-funk synths for a propulsive, percussive, dancehall-influenced finale that is inexplicable and inspired.</p> \n<h2>14. Hit Em Wit Da Hee (1998)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5ein59FLQ4\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z5ein59FLQ4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Subtle but sexy, the final single from Missy Elliott\u2019s debut album is best heard in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdAZcQoTkbo\" title=\"\">remix</a> used on its supernatural-themed video and the soundtrack to teen comedy Can\u2019t Hardly Wait, where the low-riding funk of the rhythm track is disrupted by samples of neighing horses and eventually replaced by strings sourced from Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Joga.</p> \n<h2>13. Shake Your Pom-Pom (2008)</h2> \n<p>Unfairly ignored, Elliott\u2019s second single from the soundtrack of Step Up 2: The Streets was great: a clattering beat that nodded towards the kind of block-party breaks that inspired hip-hop in the first place, Missy hymning the potent effect of her \u201cbig old donkey\u201d on any passing men.</p> \n<h2>12. Gossip Folks (2002)</h2> \n<p>Haters beware: Elliott is in particularly raw-throated, bug-eyed form in a post-cameraphone but pre-social-media assault on privacy invasion and rumour-mongering that addressed questions about her sexuality. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR-CMN2aec\" title=\"\">Fatboy Slim remix</a> highlighted the ultra-hooky chorus, but the best line might be one of Missy\u2019s most inventive disses: \u201cYou soggy breasts, cow stomachs.\u201d</p> \n<h2>11. I\u2019m Really Hot (2004)</h2> \n<p>Missy Elliott was a groundbreaker, sonically and lyrically, turning hip-hop\u2019s standard narrative of sexual power and limited notion of feminine beauty on its head. She does it here: paying tribute to her own gorgeousness on the dancefloor, before sending the guy she takes home packing: \u201cYou gets nowhere, just two blue balls down in your underwear.\u201d</p> \n<h2>10. We Run This (2006)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2oIhJG7rXA\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t2oIhJG7rXA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>For all its forward-thinking, Elliott\u2019s sound frequently paid homage to hip-hop\u2019s roots. Never more so than here: We Run This is a thrilling reworking of Michael Viner\u2019s Incredible Bongo Band\u2019s b-boy anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjiU2YAlYKY\" title=\"\">Apache</a>, tricked out with a blaring horn section, filled with call-and-response vocals that sounds like a guaranteed party-starter.</p> \n<h2>9. Ching-A-Ling (2008)</h2> \n<p>The saga of Missy Elliott\u2019s still-unreleased seventh album \u2013 endlessly delayed by ill-health and artistic indecision \u2013 begins here, 11 years ago. A head-turning cacophony of airhorns, electronic noise and dub-influenced effects complete with a return to Work It\u2019s backwards-masked vocals, it is hard not to think it would have been a hit six years earlier.</p> \n<h2>8. She\u2019s a Bitch (1999)</h2> \n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opkRF3UZSJw\" title=\"\">a $2m video</a>, the first single from Elliott\u2019s second album, Da Real World, was a relative flop, which may have had less to do with its quality than the sonic risks Elliott and Timbaland were taking. She\u2019s a Bitch is stripped back to almost nothing, a two-note riff that repeats throughout, never changing, and some abstract electronic strings: it is all it needs.</p> \n<h2>7. Hot Boyz (1999)</h2> \n<p>The best single from Da Real World. Everyone who appears on the hit remix version \u2013 Nas, Q-Tip, Eve \u2013 turns in a stellar performance, but the real star is the song itself: Elliott\u2019s breathy, consumed-by-lust vocal chafing against the lyrics\u2019 hard-eyed monetary concerns; the backing, with its low-key but addictive steel pan sample and willingness to let the beat drop away into silence.</p> \n<h2>6. WTF (Where They From) (2015)</h2> \n<p>After a sporadic series of promotional releases that failed to attract much attention, WTF was a million-seller. You can see why. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/09/pharrell-williams-it-rains-they-shoot-black-people-nerd-kendrick-lamar-rihanna-ed-sheeran\" title=\"\">Pharrell Williams</a>\u2019 beat recalls the Neptunes\u2019 early 00s imperial phase, while Elliott sounds imperious as she ponders cultural appropriation and offers fair warning to young pretenders: \u201cBlah-blah-blah, you best go rewrite your bars.\u201d</p> \n<h2>5. Lose Control (2005)</h2> \n<p>By now, Elliott and Timbaland were adept at the alchemical business of making hugely exciting hit singles out of deeply unlikely ingredients. Lose Control variously features 80s electro-inspired synths and a drum machine, Ciara sweetly cooing an old-fashioned R&amp;B hook and Fatman Scoop shouting his head off. Shouldn\u2019t work; works perfectly.</p> \n<h2>4. The Rain (Supa-Dupa Fly) (1997)</h2> \n<p>It is worth considering the hip-hop era in which The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly) appeared. It was the year of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKMtZm2YuBE\" title=\"\">Puff Daddy\u2019s I\u2019ll Be Missing You</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6cvtxhUbRA\" title=\"\">Will Smith\u2019s Big Willie Style</a> and Jay-Z\u2019s pop-facing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLBNWBheD-Y\" title=\"\">In My Lifetime</a>: not the ideal moment for a female rapper clad in a bin liner to release a weird, sparse debut single. Its Ann Peebles sample provided a hook, but more important was how boldly it announced a stereotype-smashing, unique talent.</p> \n<h2>3. Pass That Dutch (2003)</h2> \n<p>Amid the sonic pyrotechnics of her greatest singles, it is easy to overlook what a fantastic rapper Missy Elliott can be. The brilliant Pass That Dutch is primary evidence \u2013 a sinister, sparse backing track with a Technicolor vocal performance: at turns insouciant, commanding, intense and very funny, complete with a faux acceptance speech.</p> \n<h2>2. Work It (2002)</h2> \n<p>Influenced by old school hip-hop \u2013 it samples Run DMC and Rock Master Scott &amp; the Dynamic Three alongside Blondie\u2019s Heart of Glass \u2013 but with its eyes fixed firmly on the future, Work It\u2019s m\u00e9lange of backward vocals, elephant samples and lyrics that would later have been labelled \u201cbody positive\u201d is totally fantastic: joyous and ahead of its time.</p> \n<h2>1. Get Ur Freak On (2001)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPoKiGQzbSQ\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FPoKiGQzbSQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>It is a close-run thing, but Get Ur Freak On just shades it as Missy Elliott\u2019s greatest single. A spare, supremely confident Top 10 masterclass in being simultaneously audacious and commercial, its relentless six-note sample \u2013 bhangra with a hint of drum\u2019n\u2019bass \u2013 keeps dropping out, leaving blank space in which Elliott can roar, whisper and shush her detractors. Horror-movie-soundtrack electronics hover ominously in the background, while voices speaking in Hindi and Japanese weave in and out of the mix. And Elliott is on fire: there is something about the don\u2019t-even-try message to her competitors that feels bound up with the way Get Ur Freak On sounds: an artist who knows she has made a strange, groundbreaking, utterly compelling masterpiece.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "22. Take Away (2001) A ballad from the album Miss E \u2026 So Addictive, enlivened by its off-kilter rhythm and queasy-sounding sample, retooled as a tribute to Elliott\u2019s late friend and collaborator Aaliyah. While the lyrics sort of fit their new purpose, the accompanying video bizarrely concludes with a version of party anthem 4 My People, apparently intended as Elliott\u2019s comment on 9/11. 21. Teary Eyed (2005) A relative flop after a string of hits, perhaps because it abandoned the frenetic futurism of her most famous singles in favour of straight-up retro R&amp;B. Teary Eyed offered further proof that Elliott could really sing and packed a decent chorus without causing the seismic thrills of Lose Control or Work It. 20. I\u2019m Better (2017) I\u2019m Better arrived 20 years after Elliott\u2019s debut single \u2013 an eternity in hip-hop \u2013 and found her paying lip service to current trends: a trap-influenced beat, a hint of slurred vowels about her delivery, lyrical references to \u201cthe bando\u201d. Less innovative than her biggest hits, it is still home to some sharp lines: \u201cMissy talk big I\u2019m so grande \u2026 I just rant like I\u2019m Kanye.\u201d 19. Beep Me 911 (1998) A heartbroken R&amp;B slow jam \u2013 featuring dimly remembered trio 702, for whom a pre-fame Elliott wrote songs \u2013 rendered into something alien-sounding: the rhythm stammers and never settles; the instruments sound slightly off-key; and Elliott\u2019s voice floats ethereally over the top, lending its saga of a collapsing relationship a blank-eyed, disaffected air. 18. 4 My People (2002) A paean to hip-hop\u2019s belated discovery of MDMA \u2013 \u201cI wanna dance and lick your face,\u201d offers Elliott, while guest vocalist Eve bemoans the ecstasy user\u2019s perennial bugbear, drunks spoiling the vibe \u2013 4 My People\u2019s four-to-the-floor house beat has an authentically sweaty, wild-eyed quality, vastly superior to hip-hop\u2019s subsequent dabblings in shiny pop-house. 17. Sock It 2 Me (1997) There is a boldness to Sock It 2 Me \u2013 which is based on a sample from the Delfonics\u2019 Ready Or Not Here I Come, a song the world should have had its fill of following the Fugees\u2019 chart-topping cover the previous year. But producer Timbaland warps the sample into a strange, disjointed new shape; Missy sings and Da Brat offers a warp-speed guest appearance. 16. All N My Grill (1999) Missy back in warped R&amp;B mode \u2013 a smart, witty take on the standard no-romance-without-finance lyric (\u201cTalk is talk and talk is cheap / Tell it to her, don\u2019t say it to me\u201d), further brightened by the appearance of Outkast\u2019s Big Boi, who goes from rapping about lingerie to issuing threats in archaic English (\u201cI will jab thee and stab thee\u201d). 15. One Minute Man (2001) The brilliance of Missy Elliott\u2019s exploration of the topic of premature ejaculation (spoiler: she is not terribly sympathetic) lies in the weirdness of its structure, at least in the version from the video. A minute before the end, it turns into a completely new track, dropping the G-funk synths for a propulsive, percussive, dancehall-influenced finale that is inexplicable and inspired. 14. Hit Em Wit Da Hee (1998) Subtle but sexy, the final single from Missy Elliott\u2019s debut album is best heard in the remix used on its supernatural-themed video and the soundtrack to teen comedy Can\u2019t Hardly Wait, where the low-riding funk of the rhythm track is disrupted by samples of neighing horses and eventually replaced by strings sourced from Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Joga. 13. Shake Your Pom-Pom (2008) Unfairly ignored, Elliott\u2019s second single from the soundtrack of Step Up 2: The Streets was great: a clattering beat that nodded towards the kind of block-party breaks that inspired hip-hop in the first place, Missy hymning the potent effect of her \u201cbig old donkey\u201d on any passing men. 12. Gossip Folks (2002) Haters beware: Elliott is in particularly raw-throated, bug-eyed form in a post-cameraphone but pre-social-media assault on privacy invasion and rumour-mongering that addressed questions about her sexuality. A Fatboy Slim remix highlighted the ultra-hooky chorus, but the best line might be one of Missy\u2019s most inventive disses: \u201cYou soggy breasts, cow stomachs.\u201d 11. I\u2019m Really Hot (2004) Missy Elliott was a groundbreaker, sonically and lyrically, turning hip-hop\u2019s standard narrative of sexual power and limited notion of feminine beauty on its head. She does it here: paying tribute to her own gorgeousness on the dancefloor, before sending the guy she takes home packing: \u201cYou gets nowhere, just two blue balls down in your underwear.\u201d 10. We Run This (2006) For all its forward-thinking, Elliott\u2019s sound frequently paid homage to hip-hop\u2019s roots. Never more so than here: We Run This is a thrilling reworking of Michael Viner\u2019s Incredible Bongo Band\u2019s b-boy anthem Apache, tricked out with a blaring horn section, filled with call-and-response vocals that sounds like a guaranteed party-starter. 9. Ching-A-Ling (2008) The saga of Missy Elliott\u2019s still-unreleased seventh album \u2013 endlessly delayed by ill-health and artistic indecision \u2013 begins here, 11 years ago. A head-turning cacophony of airhorns, electronic noise and dub-influenced effects complete with a return to Work It\u2019s backwards-masked vocals, it is hard not to think it would have been a hit six years earlier. 8. She\u2019s a Bitch (1999) Despite a $2m video, the first single from Elliott\u2019s second album, Da Real World, was a relative flop, which may have had less to do with its quality than the sonic risks Elliott and Timbaland were taking. She\u2019s a Bitch is stripped back to almost nothing, a two-note riff that repeats throughout, never changing, and some abstract electronic strings: it is all it needs. 7. Hot Boyz (1999) The best single from Da Real World. Everyone who appears on the hit remix version \u2013 Nas, Q-Tip, Eve \u2013 turns in a stellar performance, but the real star is the song itself: Elliott\u2019s breathy, consumed-by-lust vocal chafing against the lyrics\u2019 hard-eyed monetary concerns; the backing, with its low-key but addictive steel pan sample and willingness to let the beat drop away into silence. 6. WTF (Where They From) (2015) After a sporadic series of promotional releases that failed to attract much attention, WTF was a million-seller. You can see why. Pharrell Williams\u2019 beat recalls the Neptunes\u2019 early 00s imperial phase, while Elliott sounds imperious as she ponders cultural appropriation and offers fair warning to young pretenders: \u201cBlah-blah-blah, you best go rewrite your bars.\u201d 5. Lose Control (2005) By now, Elliott and Timbaland were adept at the alchemical business of making hugely exciting hit singles out of deeply unlikely ingredients. Lose Control variously features 80s electro-inspired synths and a drum machine, Ciara sweetly cooing an old-fashioned R&amp;B hook and Fatman Scoop shouting his head off. Shouldn\u2019t work; works perfectly. 4. The Rain (Supa-Dupa Fly) (1997) It is worth considering the hip-hop era in which The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly) appeared. It was the year of Puff Daddy\u2019s I\u2019ll Be Missing You, Will Smith\u2019s Big Willie Style and Jay-Z\u2019s pop-facing In My Lifetime: not the ideal moment for a female rapper clad in a bin liner to release a weird, sparse debut single. Its Ann Peebles sample provided a hook, but more important was how boldly it announced a stereotype-smashing, unique talent. 3. Pass That Dutch (2003) Amid the sonic pyrotechnics of her greatest singles, it is easy to overlook what a fantastic rapper Missy Elliott can be. The brilliant Pass That Dutch is primary evidence \u2013 a sinister, sparse backing track with a Technicolor vocal performance: at turns insouciant, commanding, intense and very funny, complete with a faux acceptance speech. 2. Work It (2002) Influenced by old school hip-hop \u2013 it samples Run DMC and Rock Master Scott &amp; the Dynamic Three alongside Blondie\u2019s Heart of Glass \u2013 but with its eyes fixed firmly on the future, Work It\u2019s m\u00e9lange of backward vocals, elephant samples and lyrics that would later have been labelled \u201cbody positive\u201d is totally fantastic: joyous and ahead of its time. 1. Get Ur Freak On (2001) It is a close-run thing, but Get Ur Freak On just shades it as Missy Elliott\u2019s greatest single. A spare, supremely confident Top 10 masterclass in being simultaneously audacious and commercial, its relentless six-note sample \u2013 bhangra with a hint of drum\u2019n\u2019bass \u2013 keeps dropping out, leaving blank space in which Elliott can roar, whisper and shush her detractors. Horror-movie-soundtrack electronics hover ominously in the background, while voices speaking in Hindi and Japanese weave in and out of the mix. And Elliott is on fire: there is something about the don\u2019t-even-try message to her competitors that feels bound up with the way Get Ur Freak On sounds: an artist who knows she has made a strange, groundbreaking, utterly compelling masterpiece.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is facing a third legal case to try to block the suspension of parliament after the high court in Belfast held an urgent hearing for an injunction against the prime minister. The case follows similar legal battles launched in Scotland and England by the SNP justice spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, and the campaigner Gina Miller. The Northern Ireland case is being brought by Raymond McCord, a victims\u2019 rights campaigner who has argued that no deal is a breach of the Good Friday agreement. \u201cWe are seeking an urgent injunction to compel Johnson to reverse his advice to the queen to prorogue parliament,\u201d said McCord\u2019s lawyer, Ciaran O\u2019Hare, after the 20-minute hearing on Thursday morning. The lord chief justice broke his summer holiday to hear the prima facie arguments. He instructed the applicant and the government\u2019s defence barrister to return on Friday at 10am with expanded legal arguments for a full hearing. McCord\u2019s solicitors said the decision to hear the case while the court was not in session showed the seriousness with which the judge, Sir Declan Morgan, was taking the case. They argued that the motive behind the move was to frustrate attempts to stop a no-deal Brexit and that Johnson had prorogued parliament \u201cwithout democratic intent\u201d. McCord\u2019s case that a no-deal Brexit undermined the Good Friday agreement was due to be heard on 16 September but, following the decision to prorogue parliament, his solicitors rushed in an application for an immediate injunction. \u201cYou now have cases in Scotland and England but in terms of litigation we believe that the Northern Ireland case is the most urgent because we argue the consequences of no deal here are worse than anywhere else in the UK,\u201d said O\u2019Hare. \u201cThe court really took that on board and will give our arguments serious consideration,\u201d he added. Lawyers acting for Cherry and 74 other MPs and peers have applied to Scotland\u2019s civil court to block the suspension of parliament. A hearing was scheduled for midday on Thursday. Gina Miller has also lodged an urgent application for a judicial review over the prorogation, arguing Johnson\u2019s move was a \u201cbrazen\u201d attempt to prevent the government being held accountable for its conduct before parliament.",

It\u2019s not an overstatement to say the club was integral to the community. The local pubs, takeaways and hotels are absolutely dependent on the fans being drawn to Bury.

I really don\u2019t understand how clubs like Manchester City can receive so much scrutiny when there is no chance of them ever going bust while clubs like Bury and Bolton are left to crumble.<em> Curtis, 30, Bury</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018I feel rootless\u2019</h2> \n<p>I am devastated that the EFL have chosen to expel Bury from the league. I grew up right next to Gigg Lane. Very sadly my mum died a few months ago and now that my club has gone too. I feel rootless. I would go back to Bury to go to games with my brother and friends and call and see my mum. Being a Bury fan feels like an essential part of who I am. I started to go to games with friends at 14 so it\u2019s been a constant \u2013 a main pillar of my identity. I just can\u2019t bring myself to watch any football or read about it this season. Lots of people have suggested mergers or adopting another team but it would never be Bury. <em>Cara Taylor, 39, Mossley</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/28/bury-harry-bunn-players-struggling-stressed-life-at-club-expelled-football-league\">Bury\u2019s Harry Bunn: \u2018Some lads are struggling. People look stressed\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>\u2018My family have been going for over a century\u2019</h2> \n<p>I got into football aged 10 and started going to Bury in 2011. I have devoted so much to this club and now it\u2019s gone. My family have been going for over a century. In the eight years I\u2019ve been going, I\u2019ve seen us promoted twice and relegated twice. I was at Tranmere both times, seeing Tom Soares get a toe to the ball and Danny Mayor somehow weave through their defence.</p> \n<p>My greatest memory is when Joe Riley fires in a 30-yarder against Shrewsbury in what was my first promotion-seeing campaign. That feeling of jubilation, being connected to thousands of people who I only know because of this wonderful club, was only matched when Shrewsbury got a goal disallowed in the last minute. I am forever grateful for this club for giving me such fantastic memories and stories to tell. <em>Matthew Holmes, 18, Haslingden</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018Bury FC is an anchor for me\u2019</h2> \n<p>I moved away from Bury 10 years ago. For me the club was an anchor, a reason to visit home and part of my identity that I am proud of. Despite the current anguish, the expulsion provides relief. The historical financial transactions were going to hang over us for years to come and this gives us a clean slate to rebuild from.</p> \n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/six-warning-signs-that-the-carillion-collapse-was-coming\">Carillion</a> of football, a wake up for the industry and changes must be made. The EFL need to decide on its role and give itself additional powers and capability to stop this from happening in the future. We cannot let financiers and businessmen win while local communities and culture lose. <em>H</em><em>, 33, London</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018It\u2019s been a constant through my life\u2019</h2> \n<p>I keep switching between anger and sadness. Other than my parents, my brother and a couple of friends it\u2019s the longest relationship I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s been a constant through my teenage years to middle age. People I met because they sat near me at Gigg Lane came to my wedding. It\u2019s given me some of my favourite memories.</p> \n<p>The thing that has really upset me is that my first child is due to be born any day now. Taking your child to their first game is something a football fan should look forward to, but that has been taken away. I have been to hundreds of games with my dad. Sadly, my child may never say that. <em>Adrian Foster, 38, Heywood</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018The only positive is the reinvigoration of love for Bury FC\u2019</h2> \n<p>As many have said over the past few day, it\u2019s been devastating \u2013 even for someone who wouldn\u2019t necessarily class themselves as a supporter. I\u2019m an interested local, who likes football and has a soft spot for their hometown team. My neighbour, a season ticket holder in his 60s, attends every home game with 12 of his close friends. It is their tradition, all they have known every other Saturday for 20 years, gone due to a string of terrible decisions completely out of their control. </p> \n<p>The only positive out of all of this is a re-invigoration of the love for Bury FC among many locals \u2013 a real desire to save a local club. The outpouring of support, the willingness to lend a hand in getting Gigg Lane ready for a match now doomed to not take place, the resonation across the country of football fans unconnected to this place and people \u2013 all dismayed at what has happened. <em>Sam Allen, 31, Bury</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018I don\u2019t have a team any more\u2019</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/28/bury-expulsion-efl-regulations-meaningless\">Bury\u2019s expulsion from EFL shows football\u2019s regulations are meaningless | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I\u2019ve been a supporter for 27 years, since my first game aged eight. I feel sad, angry, empty. Mostly, that it was so unnecessary. At clubs such as Bury there is no demand from fans for the owner to bet the house on winning promotion. I never expected Bury to be good; most of the time the team were useless, but that was OK. When they were good, it was a bonus. The main thing was that they were there. For me, it feels like a strange absence. Bury have been a fixture in my life for as long as I remember.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t have a team any more. I don\u2019t have a result to listen out for on the radio on a Saturday afternoon. Colleagues \u2013 mainly fans of Premier League teams \u2013 keep asking me if I have chosen a new club. More likely, I will just stop paying attention to the game altogether. I don\u2019t live in the town. I feel deeply sorry for the people it will impact harder than it will on me - the people whose lives really do revolve around the club. <em>R</em><em>, 35, Guernsey</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018The club was a lifeline\u2019</h2> \n<p>Having lived in the Bury area for 35 years, I fear for the community. The club was a life line for many pensioners whose only human contact was with their Gigg Lane family and the shop cashier. It\u2019s also going to be a blow for all the fans, the Grandads who introduced their kids and now those kids bringing their kids. Gigg Lane was not just about football, it\u2019s one big family, where you come to recognise the same familiar cheery faces. <em>Gareth Ellis, 45, the Netherlands</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018Bury was my first access to live football\u2019</h2> \n<p>Bury was my first access to live football as a teenager. Close enough that my friends and I were allowed to get the bus down to Gigg \u2013 our first real independence. Later we were allowed to away games and obviously used that as an opportunity for underage drinking. Last year I was living in Germany and, when people would ask where I was from, I\u2019d say Manchester, because people have heard of that. Often the first response was \u201cCity or United?\u201d It\u2019s great to be able to say neither and bend someone\u2019s ear about my little town nine miles north. Throw in a bit of \u201cyreet\u201d to explain the accent. I also loved that we were closer to the players than with big clubs.</p> \n<p>I recall going to Mansfield away in the early 2000s, Phil Stant scored a hat-trick and got a standing ovation all round as he was previously with Mansfield. Before that game my friend and I were wandering down an alleyway, bumped into three Bury players about 40 minutes before kick off. No idea what they were doing there, probably been for a pint. <em>R</em><em>, 37, Barry</em></p>",

Curtis, 30, Bury \u2018I feel rootless\u2019 I am devastated that the EFL have chosen to expel Bury from the league. I grew up right next to Gigg Lane. Very sadly my mum died a few months ago and now that my club has gone too. I feel rootless. I would go back to Bury to go to games with my brother and friends and call and see my mum. Being a Bury fan feels like an essential part of who I am. I started to go to games with friends at 14 so it\u2019s been a constant \u2013 a main pillar of my identity. I just can\u2019t bring myself to watch any football or read about it this season. Lots of people have suggested mergers or adopting another team but it would never be Bury. Cara Taylor, 39, Mossley \u2018My family have been going for over a century\u2019 I got into football aged 10 and started going to Bury in 2011. I have devoted so much to this club and now it\u2019s gone. My family have been going for over a century. In the eight years I\u2019ve been going, I\u2019ve seen us promoted twice and relegated twice. I was at Tranmere both times, seeing Tom Soares get a toe to the ball and Danny Mayor somehow weave through their defence. My greatest memory is when Joe Riley fires in a 30-yarder against Shrewsbury in what was my first promotion-seeing campaign. That feeling of jubilation, being connected to thousands of people who I only know because of this wonderful club, was only matched when Shrewsbury got a goal disallowed in the last minute. I am forever grateful for this club for giving me such fantastic memories and stories to tell. Matthew Holmes, 18, Haslingden \u2018Bury FC is an anchor for me\u2019 I moved away from Bury 10 years ago. For me the club was an anchor, a reason to visit home and part of my identity that I am proud of. Despite the current anguish, the expulsion provides relief. The historical financial transactions were going to hang over us for years to come and this gives us a clean slate to rebuild from. This is the Carillion of football, a wake up for the industry and changes must be made. The EFL need to decide on its role and give itself additional powers and capability to stop this from happening in the future. We cannot let financiers and businessmen win while local communities and culture lose. H, 33, London \u2018It\u2019s been a constant through my life\u2019 I keep switching between anger and sadness. Other than my parents, my brother and a couple of friends it\u2019s the longest relationship I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s been a constant through my teenage years to middle age. People I met because they sat near me at Gigg Lane came to my wedding. It\u2019s given me some of my favourite memories. The thing that has really upset me is that my first child is due to be born any day now. Taking your child to their first game is something a football fan should look forward to, but that has been taken away. I have been to hundreds of games with my dad. Sadly, my child may never say that. Adrian Foster, 38, Heywood \u2018The only positive is the reinvigoration of love for Bury FC\u2019 As many have said over the past few day, it\u2019s been devastating \u2013 even for someone who wouldn\u2019t necessarily class themselves as a supporter. I\u2019m an interested local, who likes football and has a soft spot for their hometown team. My neighbour, a season ticket holder in his 60s, attends every home game with 12 of his close friends. It is their tradition, all they have known every other Saturday for 20 years, gone due to a string of terrible decisions completely out of their control. The only positive out of all of this is a re-invigoration of the love for Bury FC among many locals \u2013 a real desire to save a local club. The outpouring of support, the willingness to lend a hand in getting Gigg Lane ready for a match now doomed to not take place, the resonation across the country of football fans unconnected to this place and people \u2013 all dismayed at what has happened. Sam Allen, 31, Bury \u2018I don\u2019t have a team any more\u2019 I\u2019ve been a supporter for 27 years, since my first game aged eight. I feel sad, angry, empty. Mostly, that it was so unnecessary. At clubs such as Bury there is no demand from fans for the owner to bet the house on winning promotion. I never expected Bury to be good; most of the time the team were useless, but that was OK. When they were good, it was a bonus. The main thing was that they were there. For me, it feels like a strange absence. Bury have been a fixture in my life for as long as I remember. I don\u2019t have a team any more. I don\u2019t have a result to listen out for on the radio on a Saturday afternoon. Colleagues \u2013 mainly fans of Premier League teams \u2013 keep asking me if I have chosen a new club. More likely, I will just stop paying attention to the game altogether. I don\u2019t live in the town. I feel deeply sorry for the people it will impact harder than it will on me - the people whose lives really do revolve around the club. R, 35, Guernsey \u2018The club was a lifeline\u2019 Having lived in the Bury area for 35 years, I fear for the community. The club was a life line for many pensioners whose only human contact was with their Gigg Lane family and the shop cashier. It\u2019s also going to be a blow for all the fans, the Grandads who introduced their kids and now those kids bringing their kids. Gigg Lane was not just about football, it\u2019s one big family, where you come to recognise the same familiar cheery faces. Gareth Ellis, 45, the Netherlands \u2018Bury was my first access to live football\u2019 Bury was my first access to live football as a teenager. Close enough that my friends and I were allowed to get the bus down to Gigg \u2013 our first real independence. Later we were allowed to away games and obviously used that as an opportunity for underage drinking. Last year I was living in Germany and, when people would ask where I was from, I\u2019d say Manchester, because people have heard of that. Often the first response was \u201cCity or United?\u201d It\u2019s great to be able to say neither and bend someone\u2019s ear about my little town nine miles north. Throw in a bit of \u201cyreet\u201d to explain the accent. I also loved that we were closer to the players than with big clubs. I recall going to Mansfield away in the early 2000s, Phil Stant scored a hat-trick and got a standing ovation all round as he was previously with Mansfield. Before that game my friend and I were wandering down an alleyway, bumped into three Bury players about 40 minutes before kick off. No idea what they were doing there, probably been for a pint.

It\u2019s hard to argue otherwise. ChuckleVision may have lacked the glamour of Miami 7, the melancholy of Greenclaws or the childhood-scarring terror of Alfonso Bonzo, but it had charm by the bucket-load.</p> <p>It helped that it ran and ran \u2013 ChuckleVision aired close to 300 episodes over two decades, which meant that it received votes from multiple generations of viewers \u2013 but the success of the series lay in the fact it was proudly old-fashioned. ChuckleVision was just two idiots failing at stuff over and over, but it was always executed flawlessly.</p> <p>This was largely because the Chuckle Brothers were old hands. They won Opportunity Knocks in the 60s and New Faces in the 70s. They ran with classic old-school entertainers, honing their craft alongside figures such as Ted Rogers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/13/lennie-bennett-obituary\">Lennie Bennett</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/may/10/freddie-starr-obituary\">Freddie Starr</a>. They weren\u2019t afraid of debasing themselves in the name of entertainment, either. Viewers old enough to remember the short-lived 80s series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOn2DZPJskE\">The Chuckle Hounds</a> will marvel at the way they performed their act in great big dumb dog costumes, accompanied by witless swanee whistle sounds. Even so, their personas were already firmly in place. Watch an episode today and you can still tell which Chuckle Hound is Paul and which is Barry.</p> <p>But ChuckleVision is where the pair got to shine. Although we didn\u2019t learn an awful lot about them as characters \u2013 why did they have a new job every week? Were they on the run? Did they kill someone? \u2013 we did get to watch a succession of pratfalls and catchphrases that were deployed with unbeatable skill. This is why people remember ChuckleVision; not for the show, but for the chemistry between the brothers.</p> <p>The Chuckle Brothers were beloved, so much so that viewers have been able to look past their more unsavoury moments, such as when Barry was punched by the husband of a woman to whom he had been sending lewd emails, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/05/barry-chuckle-slaptick-star-who-hit-the-big-time-in-his-40s\">or when he shared a Britain First post</a> on his Facebook page. To remain a national treasure after this is incredible. No wonder ChuckleVision topped the list.</p>",

      "bodyText": "ChuckleVision has been named the greatest CBBC show of all time by a Radio Times survey. It\u2019s hard to argue otherwise. ChuckleVision may have lacked the glamour of Miami 7, the melancholy of Greenclaws or the childhood-scarring terror of Alfonso Bonzo, but it had charm by the bucket-load. It helped that it ran and ran \u2013 ChuckleVision aired close to 300 episodes over two decades, which meant that it received votes from multiple generations of viewers \u2013 but the success of the series lay in the fact it was proudly old-fashioned. ChuckleVision was just two idiots failing at stuff over and over, but it was always executed flawlessly. This was largely because the Chuckle Brothers were old hands. They won Opportunity Knocks in the 60s and New Faces in the 70s. They ran with classic old-school entertainers, honing their craft alongside figures such as Ted Rogers, Lennie Bennett and Freddie Starr. They weren\u2019t afraid of debasing themselves in the name of entertainment, either. Viewers old enough to remember the short-lived 80s series The Chuckle Hounds will marvel at the way they performed their act in great big dumb dog costumes, accompanied by witless swanee whistle sounds. Even so, their personas were already firmly in place. Watch an episode today and you can still tell which Chuckle Hound is Paul and which is Barry. But ChuckleVision is where the pair got to shine. Although we didn\u2019t learn an awful lot about them as characters \u2013 why did they have a new job every week? Were they on the run? Did they kill someone? \u2013 we did get to watch a succession of pratfalls and catchphrases that were deployed with unbeatable skill. This is why people remember ChuckleVision; not for the show, but for the chemistry between the brothers. The Chuckle Brothers were beloved, so much so that viewers have been able to look past their more unsavoury moments, such as when Barry was punched by the husband of a woman to whom he had been sending lewd emails, or when he shared a Britain First post on his Facebook page. To remain a national treasure after this is incredible. No wonder ChuckleVision topped the list.",

Brands swear that their leather is from Europe rather than 6,000 miles away in the Brazilian Amazon. I find this unlikely. If all the shoes professing Italian heritage really were from Italian cattle, cows would drink from the Trevi fountain and chew the cud in Piazza San Marco. If the crisis in the Amazon does one thing, I hope it wakes us up to the true cost of Amazon leather. More conscious Buying consciously from the Amazon means supporting brands that are Amazon-first, putting the ecology and people of the biome above profit and volume. Here are our top brands investing in the Amazon rather than exploiting it: Veja The Brazilian Amazon is the only place on Earth where rubber trees grow in a wild state. Environmentalist Bia Saldanha moved her family to the Chico Mendes reserve in Acre (named after the activist murdered in 1998 for his work) many years ago and works with 20 seringueiros families rubber tapping wild trees sustainably. Two or three times a week, the seringueiros collect 12kg of wild rubber primarily destined for the soles of Veja trainers, made in Portugal in a fair-trade factory. In 2018, this collaboration preserved 90 hectares of forest, says Saldanha. Au\u00e1 Jair Bolsonaro has also declared war on the 400 indigenous communities who inhabit the rainforest. These groups, according to Fiona Watson, director of research at Survival International, possess \u201cvast and acute botanical and zoological knowledge \u2026 and protect some of the largest and most biodiverse forests on Earth\u201d. Au\u00e1 is a southern Brazilian brand that works with artists and indigenous communities to develop collections where all are equal partners, with the avoidance of cultural appropriation \u2013 one of fashion\u2019s biggest pitfalls \u2013 in mind. The Au\u00e1 team, which includes an inhouse anthropologist, negotiate the terms of use of patterns and designs from indigenous communities. Osklen Osklen is one of Brazil\u2019s most established sustainable fashion brands. The company was founded by a former doctor, Oskar Metsavaht, in 1988 and is known for pioneering sustainable fabrics. The brand\u2019s motto is \u201cas sustainable as possible, as soon as possible\u201d \u2013 he refuses to wait for certification bodies to catch up. An early avoider of cattle leather on environmental grounds, Metsavaht has pioneered the use of skins from the pirarucu fish found in Amazonian rivers and lakes. Olsken bags from pirarucu are sold all over the world, generating a new income source for the area. Olsken\u2019s sustainable practices and materials are being studied by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Bottletop The London-based accessories brand has an enduring relationship with Brazil. The classic Bottletop bag is made from ring pulls (recovered from Brazilian landfill), handpainted in an atelier in Itapua that works to fair-trade principles, and then linked together with leather that is certified zero-deforestation. The brand also produces Together wrist-bands, promoting the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. What can we do? In response to the Amazon fires and an Extinction Rebellion protest outside the Brazilian embassy in London last Friday, a promise of match-funding has been made to the tune of $350,000 for the Climate Emergency Fund. To join the surge and donate, visit this website. Greenpeace wants you to sign a petition to tell the government to suspend trade talks with Brazil until the fires are out and the Amazon and its people are protected. Plant trees: Offest.Earth is fundraising for a protest forest, in the name of Bolsonaro, \u201ctree enemy number one\u201d. So far 4,000 trees have been planted. Donations can be made here. Donate to Cool Earth via its website.",

At the back of the park, the giant slide with 37 steps was still there, and so were the brambles. The lake was still smelly and full of mallards, unchanged across decades. Then, in 2012, when my son had just started walking, we came across something new. In another corner of the park a giant climbing structure had appeared, with tunnels, frames and rope swings created as if out of thin air. It was an adventure playground \u2013 a proper one, of the kind you could imagine mucky kids in flares and tank tops emerging out of to ride home on Chopper bikes. My son got stuck into the sandpit, pouring water down funnels made of old guttering and splodging paint over planks of wood. The older kids pushed him, and later his younger sister, in the basket swings. Every time we came back, it had changed \u2013 improved and augmented by the children who used it in cooperation with the small staff of playworkers and volunteers, working together to make the place better. We go there every school holiday now. My children march around telling everyone, \u201cWe\u2019re from Liverpool and we\u2019re visiting our nanny\u2019s house!\u201d Being Scousers, their sense of place is strong and very positive. I envy them that, of course, but I\u2019m \u2013 to use a Scouse phrase \u2013 made up to know they are happy in both places. When we are at the playground it feels as though my children have regained the paradise my nan saw in Chelmsley Wood when it was brand new. A place of freedom and freshness, where there is nothing to be afraid of, or to escape from. \u2022 Lynsey Hanley is the author of Estates: an Intimate History, and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide",

Johnson stunned many at Westminster on Wednesday when he received the permission of the Queen to prorogue parliament from mid-September to 14 October.

Protests erupt in UK over Johnson\u2019s \u2018constitutional outrage\u2019 The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has boosted the chances of a damaging, no-deal Brexit by announcing he will suspend the country\u2019s parliament for five weeks, stifling debate in the run-up to Britain\u2019s scheduled departure from the EU on 31 October. The news sparked protests across the country on Wednesday, as rebel MPs from several parties convened to try to block the move, which the Speaker of the House of Commons described as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. \u2018Prorogation\u2019 explained. For those not steeped in the minutiae of the Brexit battle and UK politics, Alison Rourke explains why, and how, Johnson has suspended \u2013 or \u201cprorogued\u201d \u2013 parliament. \u2018Mad suggestion\u2019. Just weeks ago, senior members of Johnson\u2019s cabinet described the very idea of proroguing parliament as \u201carchaic\u201d, \u201cmad\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d. Opioids payouts from Big Pharma \u2018questionable\u2019, say experts Experts have greeted news of two vast drug manufacturer payouts over the opioid crisis with a mixture of optimism and skepticism, with the photographer and campaigner Nan Goldin telling the Guardian that a reported settlement offered by the makers of the controversial painkiller OxyContin was \u201chighly questionable\u201d. It was reported this week that Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family had offered up to $12bn to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits. Johnson &amp; Johnson. Another pharmaceutical giant, Johnson &amp; Johnson, was on Monday ordered by an Oklahoma court to pay out $572m over its role in the opioids epidemic. Activists arrested. Goldin and 12 other activists supporting safe injection sites for drug addicts were arrested on Wednesday, after barricading the entrance of New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office building. Gillibrand drops out of Democratic presidential race Kirsten Gillibrand, the Democratic US senator from New York, has become perhaps the most high-profile candidate yet to drop out of the 2020 presidential race, after failing to break out of the low single-digits in polls and secure a spot in the third round of televised debates. Gillibrand, one of a record number of women in the 2020 field, said in a video posted to Twitter on Wednesday that it was \u201cimportant to know when it\u2019s not your time\u201d. Remaining candidates. Gillibrand is the sixth contender to exit the Democratic race, leaving a mere 20 candidates still officially in the running, 10 of whom have failed to reach the minimum 2% in two polls required to qualify for the next debate. Italian president gives Conte mandate to form new government Italy\u2019s head of state has given two former political enemies the chance to form a new government, capping an extraordinary three weeks that could mark a turning point in the country\u2019s frayed relations with the European Union. President Sergio Mattarella handed Giuseppe Conte a fresh mandate to put together a new coalition of the 5 Star Movement (M5S) and opposition Democratic party (PD). Conte resigned as prime minister last week after the far-right League party withdrew from its coalition with M5S. The deal pushed the League into opposition, dealing a blow to its leader Matteo Salvini, who has been pushing for snap elections. Skull of oldest-known human ancestor found in Ethiopia Scientists have \u201cput a face to the name\u201d of the oldest-known species on the human evolutionary tree, after the 3.8 million-year-old skull of an ancient hominin, Australopithecus anamensis, was found intact in Ethiopia. The species is believed to be a direct ancestor of \u201cLucy\u201d, a longstanding landmark in the study of human evolution, and dates back to a time when our ancestors walked on two legs but still had distinctly ape-like faces and small brains. Adult male. The specimen, first unearthed by a local worker in the Afar region of northern Ethiopia, is a near-complete adult male skull, which researchers have casually named MRD. Crib sheet The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has been greeted by cheering crowds in New York after crossing the Atlantic on a zero-carbon yacht to attend next month\u2019s UN climate summit. China has said its forces are simply performing regular troop movements, after military vehicles were spotted crossing into Hong Kong, raising fears of a Beijing-led crackdown after months of political unrest in the semi-autonomous territory. The Trump administration has stepped up efforts to track oil tankers linked to China, amid signs they are helping transport Iranian oil in defiance of US sanctions \u2013 a convergence of the White House\u2019s two biggest foreign policy headaches. A UN commission that has spent 12 years investigating graft in Guatemala has said in its final report that the country has been \u201ccaptured\u201d by corruption, and that the issue \u201ccannot be solved without a profound restructuring of the state\u201d.

      "body": "<p>If you have ever omitted to chill your beer, then shoved four cans in the freezer only to forget about the last one and watch it perish; if you have ever been to a festival and ordered white wine, forgetting that festivals never cool it properly, and had to neck something that tasted like a day-old Lemsip; if you have ever wondered why mojitos in a can are so damn tasty that even members of the shadow cabinet drink them, physics has the answer. Specifically, two Warsaw-based physicists, \u00c1lvaro D\u00edez and Tibor Pal, who have devised <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/food/chilled-drink\" title=\"\">a chilled drinks calculator</a>. You provide basic information \u2013 what the drink is, what container it is in, how much of it there is, where it was before you started chilling it, whether it is going in the fridge or the freezer, what temperature you want to drink it at \u2013 and the calculator will tell you how long that will take, to within a minute\u2019s accuracy.</p> <p>The first thing you should know is that it takes longer than you think. A half-litre of water in a plastic bottle will take 77 minutes, and that is only to get from 30C (86F) down to 6C (43F) (in water terms, \u201crefreshing\u201d). The second thing you should know is that drinks operate at a delicate balance. If white wine and ros\u00e9 aren\u2019t cold enough, the alcohol starts to dominate, which it is meant to do in a red wine, but is harsh in a white. For most whites, 9-13C (48-55F) is optimal; any colder, and you will start to lose the flavour altogether and taste only coldness. For white wines with very high sugar \u2013 dessert wines, basically, and white port \u2013 the band is narrower: 10-12C (50-54F). </p> <p>What kind of person obsesses about all this? D\u00edez, 27, is doing a masters on the mathematical computer modelling of physical phenomena. His passion is to apply physics to anything that crosses his path; in his room (I haven\u2019t seen this, only heard it described), everything is stacked in boxes that are exactly the size of the thing they contain. Pal, meanwhile, is transfixed by hydration and has calculated that, for maximum quench, you need to drink your water at 16C (61F), which is surprisingly warm.</p> <p>Mostly speaking, says D\u00edez, \u201cif you want to really enjoy the taste, you have to have most things lukewarm or slightly below room temperature. That\u2019s just chemistry. Otherwise you don\u2019t get all the flavours into your mouth.\u201d Don\u2019t forget that when drinks people say \u201croom temperature\u201d, particularly old-fashioned drinks people, they are talking about rooms as they were in Victorian times, 16-18C (61-64F), not the 21C (70F) most of us would currently think of.</p> <p>The more emphatic the taste of a thing, the warmer you should drink it; so red wine and brandy are best at 15-18C (59-64F). If I can add a limit to this wisdom from a layperson\u2019s perspective, my dad used to buy red wine that was incredibly bad, then add boiling water to warm it up, which would make it taste less of itself. There is such a thing as too hot, unless your wine is rubbish to start with.</p> <p>Champagne, as I am sure you know, should be colder than other white wines, but not that much colder: 8-10C (46-50F). Basically the only drink that should be as cold as you think is lager, which is best at 6-8C (43-46F). But that is because, \u201cmost of the time, people aren\u2019t drinking them for their amazing taste \u2013 they just want something refreshing that isn\u2019t water,\u201d D\u00edez remarks with authority. I am almost fully persuaded that it is a waste of throat (as they say in the trade) to drink lager for thirst-quenching purposes. You should drink water until you are no longer thirsty, then alcohol. The researchers themselves have started to look at shots of spirits in a new light: \u201cTwo degrees is the optimal temperature for a shot of gin or vodka. You\u2019re not going to taste anything, drinking like that.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, their main surprise finding was how much difference the container made: drinks in glass take more than twice as long to chill as those in cans. Does that mean we should be moving to distribute all drinks in metal, for the environment and whatnot? No, dummy. \u201cMetal is considered a thermal conductor, so you would use it when you want two surfaces to be the same temperature. Glass is considered an insulator; you use it in thermoses.

      "bodyText": "If you have ever omitted to chill your beer, then shoved four cans in the freezer only to forget about the last one and watch it perish; if you have ever been to a festival and ordered white wine, forgetting that festivals never cool it properly, and had to neck something that tasted like a day-old Lemsip; if you have ever wondered why mojitos in a can are so damn tasty that even members of the shadow cabinet drink them, physics has the answer. Specifically, two Warsaw-based physicists, \u00c1lvaro D\u00edez and Tibor Pal, who have devised a chilled drinks calculator. You provide basic information \u2013 what the drink is, what container it is in, how much of it there is, where it was before you started chilling it, whether it is going in the fridge or the freezer, what temperature you want to drink it at \u2013 and the calculator will tell you how long that will take, to within a minute\u2019s accuracy. The first thing you should know is that it takes longer than you think. A half-litre of water in a plastic bottle will take 77 minutes, and that is only to get from 30C (86F) down to 6C (43F) (in water terms, \u201crefreshing\u201d). The second thing you should know is that drinks operate at a delicate balance. If white wine and ros\u00e9 aren\u2019t cold enough, the alcohol starts to dominate, which it is meant to do in a red wine, but is harsh in a white. For most whites, 9-13C (48-55F) is optimal; any colder, and you will start to lose the flavour altogether and taste only coldness. For white wines with very high sugar \u2013 dessert wines, basically, and white port \u2013 the band is narrower: 10-12C (50-54F). What kind of person obsesses about all this? D\u00edez, 27, is doing a masters on the mathematical computer modelling of physical phenomena. His passion is to apply physics to anything that crosses his path; in his room (I haven\u2019t seen this, only heard it described), everything is stacked in boxes that are exactly the size of the thing they contain. Pal, meanwhile, is transfixed by hydration and has calculated that, for maximum quench, you need to drink your water at 16C (61F), which is surprisingly warm. Mostly speaking, says D\u00edez, \u201cif you want to really enjoy the taste, you have to have most things lukewarm or slightly below room temperature. That\u2019s just chemistry. Otherwise you don\u2019t get all the flavours into your mouth.\u201d Don\u2019t forget that when drinks people say \u201croom temperature\u201d, particularly old-fashioned drinks people, they are talking about rooms as they were in Victorian times, 16-18C (61-64F), not the 21C (70F) most of us would currently think of. The more emphatic the taste of a thing, the warmer you should drink it; so red wine and brandy are best at 15-18C (59-64F). If I can add a limit to this wisdom from a layperson\u2019s perspective, my dad used to buy red wine that was incredibly bad, then add boiling water to warm it up, which would make it taste less of itself. There is such a thing as too hot, unless your wine is rubbish to start with. Champagne, as I am sure you know, should be colder than other white wines, but not that much colder: 8-10C (46-50F). Basically the only drink that should be as cold as you think is lager, which is best at 6-8C (43-46F). But that is because, \u201cmost of the time, people aren\u2019t drinking them for their amazing taste \u2013 they just want something refreshing that isn\u2019t water,\u201d D\u00edez remarks with authority. I am almost fully persuaded that it is a waste of throat (as they say in the trade) to drink lager for thirst-quenching purposes. You should drink water until you are no longer thirsty, then alcohol. The researchers themselves have started to look at shots of spirits in a new light: \u201cTwo degrees is the optimal temperature for a shot of gin or vodka. You\u2019re not going to taste anything, drinking like that.\u201d Otherwise, their main surprise finding was how much difference the container made: drinks in glass take more than twice as long to chill as those in cans. Does that mean we should be moving to distribute all drinks in metal, for the environment and whatnot? No, dummy. \u201cMetal is considered a thermal conductor, so you would use it when you want two surfaces to be the same temperature. Glass is considered an insulator; you use it in thermoses. So, obviously, it takes longer to chill, but it insulates the drink very well, so it\u2019s much better if you\u2019re moving drinks from one place to another.\u201d Beyond that, your freezer is not really designed to cool things down. It is designed to keep things cool. If you put two bottles of wine in there, its temperature will go up faster than that of the bottles will go down. Possibly the most important take-home is that if you have anything you know you want to drink cold, store it in a cool place to begin with, so it has less far to travel. The researchers drink red wine for preference now, because it is quite hard to get that wrong. And if the main problem with water is that it doesn\u2019t taste of enough, there are better answers to that \u2013 slices of lemon, sprigs of mint \u2013 than just drinking lager.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it.

Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If the EU does agree a new deal, Johnson would have a few days for MPs to debate and agree to it.

It feels like that\u2019s changing and the likelihood of success is weighted slightly in our favour now. Five years ago we were looking at failed trial plots and wondering whether chickpeas were a step too far.\u201d Two years ago the company launched the UK\u2019s first commercial crops of lentils. That was followed last year by the first UK-grown chia seeds. The recent shift towards \u201cclean eating\u201d and veganism has meant that pulses, lentils, peas and beans are seeing something of a revival. The chickpea features prominently in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine \u2013 it is a staple ingredient in hummus. While popular in the UK, it is usually imported from Asian countries. In 2017, India produced 67% of the global total. Britons\u2019 insatiable appetite for hummus was underlined by a 2013 survey that marked the UK as the hummus capital of Europe, with 41% of people having pots in the fridge \u2013 almost twice as many as in any other country. However, two years ago the country experienced a hummus crisis when supermarkets emptied their shelves of the mass-produced product amid complaints of an unpleasant metallic taste.",

Among the guests on the red carpet in London this year will be Bruce Springsteen, in the city for the European premiere of Western Stars, a performance of his 19th studio album. Organisers said 229 feature films would be screened at the festival with 28 world premieres, 12 international Premieres and 28 European premieres. A fascinating European premiere is likely to be Taika Waititi\u2019s Jojo Rabbit, with the main character being a game but inept member of the Hitler Youth.

Ten films will compete for the best film award in the official competition, including Isabel Sandoval\u2019s Lingua Franca, which tells the story of a Filipino trans woman; Fanny Lye Deliver\u2019d, a period drama starring Maxine Peake; and Honey Boy, written by and starring Shia LaBeouf. Tuttle said the film landscape was a healthy one, with film-makers exploring pressing social and political problems, and emerging talents making movies with \u201cstartlingly bold, original and ambitious debuts\u201d. The UK\u2019s largest film festival remains in the shadow of Cannes, Venice and Toronto, which hoover up the most eye-catching world premieres. Venice, the world\u2019s oldest film festival, opened this week, and has again faced criticism for its poor record on female representation. The BFI London film festival runs from 2-13 October",

The painful-looking sport is believed to have been invented during the 1960s, at the Frognerbadet pool in Oslo. The first ever D\u00f8dsing Championship was a small affair, with just six divers and about a dozen spectators, but after the founding of Det internasjonale d\u00f8dseforbundet (The International D\u00f8dsing Association) in 2011, its popularity has grown. These days, the World D\u00f8dsing Championship held at Frognerbadet featured close to 100 divers and thousands of spectators.

      "bodyText": "1) It has been a devastating week for Bury Football Club. After 125 years in the Football League, they have been expelled by the EFL after a takeover bid collapsed. The club have a rich history, so here are a few choice highlights. Lots of memories from Bury\u2019s promotion to League One last season, but this goal from (centre back!) Eoghan O\u2019Connell is probably the pick of the bunch. On the last day in 2014-15, Bury leapfrogged Southend into third place of League Two with a 1-0 win over Tranmere to secure automatic promotion \u2013 here\u2019s the story of that day. Manchester City and Bury are poles apart now, but back in 1998, Paul Butler secured a 1-0 win for The Shakers over their local rivals at Maine Road (City would later be relegated). The season before, Bury secured back-to-back promotions to reach the second tier (for the first time since 1969), with a 2-0 win over Millwall. What an atmosphere at Gigg Lane it was. David Lee: wing wizard. And we can\u2019t seem to find any video footage of Bury\u2019s famous FA Cup wins in 1903 and 1900, but please do comment BTL if you do find any. 2) Turns out professional sumo wrestlers Hakuho and Kakuryu are pretty tidy at basketball. And it transpires that pint-sized Welsh rugby legend Shane Williams is not too shabby at sumo wrestling. 3) Welcome to Death Diving, or D\u00f8dsing as it is called in Norwegian. The painful-looking sport is believed to have been invented during the 1960s, at the Frognerbadet pool in Oslo. The first ever D\u00f8dsing Championship was a small affair, with just six divers and about a dozen spectators, but after the founding of Det internasjonale d\u00f8dseforbundet (The International D\u00f8dsing Association) in 2011, its popularity has grown.

Here are the top 10 dives from this year\u2019s championship, with some other highlights below. 4) The north London derby returns to the Emirates on Sunday. Arsenal won the fixture last season, here\u2019s the DVD video they made to commemorate the occasion. \u201cI\u2019ve never been hyped up for a game more in my life,\u201d says a young voice. Hmm. Tottenham have had their share of decent moments too, though, and here are 10 of their best goals from recent years. 5) Yes, Ben Stokes may have stolen the Ashes headlines, but England\u2019s victory over Australia was also much owed to the heroics of Jack Leach, 1 not out. Here he is recreating his famous run later that evening, here\u2019s last month\u2019s92 against Ireland as a nightwatchman, a mesmeric compilation of all 51 wickets for Somerset in 2017 (including an outrageous catch from Marcus Trescothick after 13 seconds), and his favourite all-time XI, featuring Hashim Amla, Chris Rogers (as captain) and, of course, Daniel Vettori. 6) In Play to the Whistle corner: action from Metalac v Backa in Serbia\u2019s Prva Liga. Metalac\u2019s Bojan Gocanin sends Vido Markovic tumbling with a firm challenge. Backa hands go up claiming a free-kick, play continues, hands stay up, and \u2026 all hell breaks loose. Breakaway goal, run-for-your-life celebration, three red cards, plus an angry official sent to the stands. No particular rush from anyone to check on Markovic\u2019s welfare, either. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) Fingerjousting 101. 2) Manny Pacquiao, now 40 years old and senator of the Philippines, used to be quite good at boxing. Here he is taking Oscar De La Hoya to the cleaners in 2008. Spotters\u2019 badges: whobroughtoranges, BlackCaeser.",

It\u2019s been done. Just go into Chinatown,\u201d advises the chef-owner at London\u2019s Michelin-starred A Wong.</p> <p>Since Buddhism\u2019s arrival in China about 2,000 years ago, regularly abstaining from meat has been a feature of Chinese life. Wong says a meat-minimal approach to eating is now \u201cingrained\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn every province and echelon of society, people understand food is medicine and eating too much meat is not good. In old recipes, there\u2019s never a massive amount of protein. My grandmother would cook vegetable dishes and use a small amount of meat as a lubricating source of oil.\u201d</p> <p>In the Forbidden City\u2019s imperial court, that absence of meat spawned highly playful food theatre in which other ingredients were used to mimic meat. Today, Chinese chefs and food producers simulate meat and fish textures using vegetables, gluten and tofu in endless ingenious dishes and products. In these, mushrooms might pass for eel or offal, for instance, or gently cooked egg whites for crab meat.</p> <p>Despite being widely available in the UK\u2019s Chinese supermarkets, many of the core ingredients in this cooking are little known outside Chinese kitchens. \u201cWhen westerners think of tofu,\u201d Wong says, \u201cthey think of one hard, claggy 80s product, not the variety and finesse in 50 types of tofu all specific to individual dishes. Now you can get tofu as smooth as creme brulee. Bean curd skin, a tofu by-product, is versatile, too. You can fry and crisp it, steam things in it to give them a skin-like texture or cook it over fire, to create this crunchy, cheesy, stringy thing.\u201d</p> <p>All this mimicry is underpinned by numerous fermented ingredients that build umami flavours into dishes: \u201cBean curd or chilli bean paste, dried black beans, preserved dried vegetables \u2013 these all add layers of savouriness that fool your brain into thinking there must be meat there.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Ethiopia</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8a5cde9b507b81106145538525911e972d34763\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8a5cde9b507b81106145538525911e972d34763/0_1449_3517_2110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A typical Ethiopian sharing platter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A typical Ethiopian sharing platter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Isaac/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even within Orthodox Christianity, the Ethiopian Tewahedo church is hardcore on fasting. Its attempts to \u201cchastise the body\u201d, as St Paul advised, mean followers abstain from meat and dairy for up to 180 days of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s very common to be vegan every Wednesday and Friday,\u201d says Tutu Melaku, the chef-owner at Tutu\u2019s Ethiopian Table in Reading, who estimates that, given that meat is still a luxury product for many: \u201cThe Ethiopian diet is 70% vegan.\u201d</p> <p>Some Ethiopian staples, such as injera, a tangy, pancake-like bread made from fermented batter, can take years to master. \u201cSometimes, even I don\u2019t get what I really want,\u201d laughs Melaku, who uses wheat flour, not the traditional teff, in her injera. Export, she believes, is exacerbating the soaring cost of teff back home, so she adapted: \u201cWhy do I need to bring teff from my people, taking what they can\u2019t even afford? I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>However, from breakfast beso, a pan-toasted barley flour porridge, to tikil gomen, a cabbage and fried potato dish seasoned with whole jalape\u00f1o, there are easier ways into Ethiopian cooking. On fasting days, families often enjoy beyaynetu, individual vegetarian platters where dishes such as fasolia (green beans in tomato sauce), gomen (simmered greens), shiro (a highly seasoned chickpea flour paste similar in texture to pease pudding) and thick, spicy wat stews are all served on an injera flatbread.</p> <p>From misir (red lentil) to atakilt (cabbage, potato and carrot), wat stews of just a few ingredients, perfumed with hot berbere spice mix, are central to Ethiopian cooking. Find a high-quality berbere and take time with the wat\u2019s onion base. The onions must be finely chopped and gently sweated until utterly broken down, which can take over an hour. \u201cWe do everything by the book and by hand,\u201d says Melaku.</p> <h2><strong>India</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"219884950a28571efc2743f252910d9437bcac95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/219884950a28571efc2743f252910d9437bcac95/0_248_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khandvi, pillowy pasta-like rolls made with gram flour and yoghurt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khandvi, pillowy pasta-like rolls made with gram flour and yoghurt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: subodhsathe/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mayur Patel, co-owner of the northern Bundobust restaurants, insists the Gujarati food he grew up on is \u201csimpler than it\u2019s made out. All the ingredients are available in Asian supermarkets everywhere and we don\u2019t use dozens of spices. It\u2019s more about how you combine and cook them \u2013 say, adding the garam masala at the beginning or end, which creates completely different flavours.\u201d</p> <p>You do not need to understand the Ayurvedic roots of meat-free Hindu cooking (certain \u201chot\u201d foods are thought to dangerously excite the senses, yet fresh green chillies are somehow \u201ccalming\u201d) to get to grips with Patel\u2019s beloved dhal baht, \u201clike Indian gravy that you add to rice\u201d, or bataka shak, a dry-fried potato curry. Instead, you need to stock up on seasonings (mustard seed, fenugreek, coriander powder, cumin, asafoetida and curry leaves), buy a pressure cooker to speed up all those lentils you will be cooking and, importantly, perfect your tempering to either start a curry or finish one with a flourish.</p> <p>\u201cStarting by tempering oil with fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds and ground onion is fundamental. That gives you that savoury, jammy, umami flavour, like Marmite. Then, as you add fresh ingredients \u2013 green beans, aubergines, potato \u2013 you get different textures coming out. Okra, for instance, really thickens the base. It\u2019s like making a cocktail, combining and blending vegetables. I think that gives you more creative space than basing a dish on one simple protein.\u201d</p> <p>It is a learning process. But you have Google and a head start, in that most Britons are familiar with the flavours of Indian food, if not the vast hinterland of Indian regional or even Gujarati cooking. Patel, for instance, is obsessed by his mum\u2019s khandvi, pillowy pasta-like rolls made with gram flour and yoghurt.</p> <h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2> <p>Salvo\u2019s serves 19 vegetarian dishes and 10 meat-free sides. The Leeds Italian has a dedicated vegan menu, too. The co-owner Gip Dammone relays these stats to demonstrate how, as the son of southern Italians \u2013 mum from Campania, dad from Sicily \u2013 he has a love of high-quality seasonal vegetables and vegetable dishes in his DNA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a00fa6e95859ec7488e032f0ff60b0b376e86fee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a00fa6e95859ec7488e032f0ff60b0b376e86fee/0_50_1200_1500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Casarecce pasta, red pepper, almond and smoked garlic pesto, confit onion and basil at Salvo\u2019s.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casarecce pasta, red pepper, almond and smoked garlic pesto, confit onion and basil at Salvo\u2019s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Salvo's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Dammone family lived in Salerno in the 70s: \u201cWe were almost naturally vegetarian without knowing. Meat was an expensive commodity, utilised sparingly. Mum would send me to the butcher\u2019s, but I never ordered more than 100g of meat. A meat ragu wasn\u2019t a load of mince; you\u2019d be excited to find a scrap of meat in there. We\u2019d have mainly bread meatballs or often \u2018meatballs\u2019 made with diced, fried aubergine.\u201d</p> <p>In the poorer Italian south, families had learned to cook without (much) meat and, making a virtue of a necessity, use every last scrap of the beautiful produce growing in the rich volcanic soils of Puglia and Campania. Turnip tops went into pasta with capers and anchovies; bitter lettuces were stewed with garlic, oil and water; \u201c amazing\u201d quarter-inch-thick slices of aubergine (known as <em>la carne del popolo</em>, the meat of the masses), were dipped in egg, floured and fried, years before the cauliflower steak. On the courgette-mad Cilento coast, you would see sliced courgettes drying on balconies, so when they were fried, they browned quickly: \u201cThey know how to process veg in southern Italy.\u201d</p> <p>Understandably, Dammone is mystified by meat substitutes such as seitan: \u201cIt\u2019s like boiling dough. There\u2019s a better mouthful in a lot of veg.\u201d This is something he is reminded of every time he visits Italy, where \u201cvegetables are still revered in their own right\u201d. Could demanding far better vegetables be the key to unlocking Britain\u2019s meat-free future?</p> <h2><strong>Three more meat-free hot spots</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jamaica:</strong> Ital, a belief system focused on increasing \u201clivity\u201d or life-energy, whose purest adherents eat only organic, vegan food, developed alongside Rastafarianism in 30s Jamaica. Check out the bean and pumpkin curries and stews at Negril in Brixton, south London, or Liverpool\u2019s street-food outfit Ital Fresh. Think jerk-marinated cauliflower wings.</p> <p><strong>Vietnam: </strong>In Vietnam, Mahayana Buddhist dietary rules gave rise to dedicated meat-free dishes and veggie versions of everyday staples, such as banh mi sandwiches and noodle bowls. For his much-praised book Vegetarian Vi\u1ec7t Nam (\u00a325, WW Norton), Cameron Stauch spoke to monks and home cooks to get the skinny on daily dishes and specials, such as the Twelve Predestined Affinities Salad.</p> <p><strong>Greece:</strong> \u201cThe Orthodox tradition of [meat and dairy-free] fasting is strong here and widely practised,\u201d says Heather Thomas, the author of The Greek Vegetarian Cookbook (\u00a324.95, Phaidon). \u201cTrue believers abstain for several months each year, many supermarkets have dedicated nistisimo fasting foods, and some of Greece\u2019s best-loved dishes evolved from fasting: dolmadakia vine leaf parcels, Lenten spinach \u201crisotto\u201d spanakorizo, and many lentil, bean and vegetable stews like gigantes.\u201d</p>",

From misir (red lentil) to atakilt (cabbage, potato and carrot), wat stews of just a few ingredients, perfumed with hot berbere spice mix, are central to Ethiopian cooking. Find a high-quality berbere and take time with the wat\u2019s onion base. The onions must be finely chopped and gently sweated until utterly broken down, which can take over an hour. \u201cWe do everything by the book and by hand,\u201d says Melaku. India Mayur Patel, co-owner of the northern Bundobust restaurants, insists the Gujarati food he grew up on is \u201csimpler than it\u2019s made out. All the ingredients are available in Asian supermarkets everywhere and we don\u2019t use dozens of spices. It\u2019s more about how you combine and cook them \u2013 say, adding the garam masala at the beginning or end, which creates completely different flavours.\u201d You do not need to understand the Ayurvedic roots of meat-free Hindu cooking (certain \u201chot\u201d foods are thought to dangerously excite the senses, yet fresh green chillies are somehow \u201ccalming\u201d) to get to grips with Patel\u2019s beloved dhal baht, \u201clike Indian gravy that you add to rice\u201d, or bataka shak, a dry-fried potato curry. Instead, you need to stock up on seasonings (mustard seed, fenugreek, coriander powder, cumin, asafoetida and curry leaves), buy a pressure cooker to speed up all those lentils you will be cooking and, importantly, perfect your tempering to either start a curry or finish one with a flourish. \u201cStarting by tempering oil with fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds and ground onion is fundamental. That gives you that savoury, jammy, umami flavour, like Marmite. Then, as you add fresh ingredients \u2013 green beans, aubergines, potato \u2013 you get different textures coming out. Okra, for instance, really thickens the base. It\u2019s like making a cocktail, combining and blending vegetables. I think that gives you more creative space than basing a dish on one simple protein.\u201d It is a learning process. But you have Google and a head start, in that most Britons are familiar with the flavours of Indian food, if not the vast hinterland of Indian regional or even Gujarati cooking. Patel, for instance, is obsessed by his mum\u2019s khandvi, pillowy pasta-like rolls made with gram flour and yoghurt. Italy Salvo\u2019s serves 19 vegetarian dishes and 10 meat-free sides. The Leeds Italian has a dedicated vegan menu, too. The co-owner Gip Dammone relays these stats to demonstrate how, as the son of southern Italians \u2013 mum from Campania, dad from Sicily \u2013 he has a love of high-quality seasonal vegetables and vegetable dishes in his DNA. The Dammone family lived in Salerno in the 70s: \u201cWe were almost naturally vegetarian without knowing. Meat was an expensive commodity, utilised sparingly. Mum would send me to the butcher\u2019s, but I never ordered more than 100g of meat. A meat ragu wasn\u2019t a load of mince; you\u2019d be excited to find a scrap of meat in there. We\u2019d have mainly bread meatballs or often \u2018meatballs\u2019 made with diced, fried aubergine.\u201d In the poorer Italian south, families had learned to cook without (much) meat and, making a virtue of a necessity, use every last scrap of the beautiful produce growing in the rich volcanic soils of Puglia and Campania. Turnip tops went into pasta with capers and anchovies; bitter lettuces were stewed with garlic, oil and water; \u201c amazing\u201d quarter-inch-thick slices of aubergine (known as la carne del popolo, the meat of the masses), were dipped in egg, floured and fried, years before the cauliflower steak. On the courgette-mad Cilento coast, you would see sliced courgettes drying on balconies, so when they were fried, they browned quickly: \u201cThey know how to process veg in southern Italy.\u201d Understandably, Dammone is mystified by meat substitutes such as seitan: \u201cIt\u2019s like boiling dough. There\u2019s a better mouthful in a lot of veg.\u201d This is something he is reminded of every time he visits Italy, where \u201cvegetables are still revered in their own right\u201d. Could demanding far better vegetables be the key to unlocking Britain\u2019s meat-free future? Three more meat-free hot spots Jamaica: Ital, a belief system focused on increasing \u201clivity\u201d or life-energy, whose purest adherents eat only organic, vegan food, developed alongside Rastafarianism in 30s Jamaica. Check out the bean and pumpkin curries and stews at Negril in Brixton, south London, or Liverpool\u2019s street-food outfit Ital Fresh. Think jerk-marinated cauliflower wings. Vietnam: In Vietnam, Mahayana Buddhist dietary rules gave rise to dedicated meat-free dishes and veggie versions of everyday staples, such as banh mi sandwiches and noodle bowls. For his much-praised book Vegetarian Vi\u1ec7t Nam (\u00a325, WW Norton), Cameron Stauch spoke to monks and home cooks to get the skinny on daily dishes and specials, such as the Twelve Predestined Affinities Salad. Greece: \u201cThe Orthodox tradition of [meat and dairy-free] fasting is strong here and widely practised,\u201d says Heather Thomas, the author of The Greek Vegetarian Cookbook (\u00a324.95, Phaidon). \u201cTrue believers abstain for several months each year, many supermarkets have dedicated nistisimo fasting foods, and some of Greece\u2019s best-loved dishes evolved from fasting: dolmadakia vine leaf parcels, Lenten spinach \u201crisotto\u201d spanakorizo, and many lentil, bean and vegetable stews like gigantes.\u201d",

More so now than ever before we\u2019re seeing requests for wonderfully personalised ceremonies, whether that be on the 18th hole of a golf club, or having a pet dog present. The choices are endless and so it\u2019s absolutely crucial that people make their wishes known to ensure they\u2019re not missed.\u201d</p> <p>The study also found the use of formal pallbearers to carry coffins has declined in the past five years. Requests for ceremonies to take place away from churches have increased, with locations including a zoo, on a bus, on a golf course or in a teepee. Most of the Co-op\u2019s undertakers had arranged a funeral where mourners wore bright clothing and half have known mourners to dress in jeans and tracksuits.</p> <p>More than half (57%) of funeral directors had received requests for pets to be present at funerals, whether leading the hearse, attending the service or joining the wake. Three-quarters had organised unusual floral tributes including a packet of Werther\u2019s Originals and a 3D lion\u2019s head, while traditional coffins were being replaced by rainbow colours, football team crests and leopard print.</p> <p>Humanists UK, the largest provider of humanist funerals in the UK, welcomed the findings. Its director of community services, Teddy Prout, said: \u201cThis report gives insight into the changing nature of funerals in the UK, including the increasing numbers opting for personalised, bespoke funerals over traditional religious funerals, which are in decline. This is reflective of the huge societal shift of more people identifying as non-religious than ever before and with that, perhaps, comes more open attitudes towards death.\u201d</p> <p>Co-op Funeralcare conducts almost 100,000 funerals every year for more than 1,000 regional funeral homes. The industry is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/29/uk-funerals-industry-under-investigation-high-prices-cma\">being investigated</a> by the Competition and Markets Authority to see if people are being charged too much.</p>",

One in 25 funerals arranged by the Co-op are direct cremations, perhaps inspired by the wishes of the late David Bowie. The musician, who died in January 2016, was cremated with no family or friends present after specifying that he did not want a funeral service (his ashes were scattered in Bali). The findings build on the Co-op\u2019s national study into dying in the UK, for which more than 30,000 Britons were questioned last year, in an attempt to break taboos around bereavement and ensure the wishes of the deceased are followed. Samantha Tyrer, the managing director of Co-op Funeralcare, said: \u201cThe funeral sector is rapidly changing. More so now than ever before we\u2019re seeing requests for wonderfully personalised ceremonies, whether that be on the 18th hole of a golf club, or having a pet dog present. The choices are endless and so it\u2019s absolutely crucial that people make their wishes known to ensure they\u2019re not missed.\u201d The study also found the use of formal pallbearers to carry coffins has declined in the past five years. Requests for ceremonies to take place away from churches have increased, with locations including a zoo, on a bus, on a golf course or in a teepee. Most of the Co-op\u2019s undertakers had arranged a funeral where mourners wore bright clothing and half have known mourners to dress in jeans and tracksuits. More than half (57%) of funeral directors had received requests for pets to be present at funerals, whether leading the hearse, attending the service or joining the wake. Three-quarters had organised unusual floral tributes including a packet of Werther\u2019s Originals and a 3D lion\u2019s head, while traditional coffins were being replaced by rainbow colours, football team crests and leopard print. Humanists UK, the largest provider of humanist funerals in the UK, welcomed the findings. Its director of community services, Teddy Prout, said: \u201cThis report gives insight into the changing nature of funerals in the UK, including the increasing numbers opting for personalised, bespoke funerals over traditional religious funerals, which are in decline. This is reflective of the huge societal shift of more people identifying as non-religious than ever before and with that, perhaps, comes more open attitudes towards death.\u201d Co-op Funeralcare conducts almost 100,000 funerals every year for more than 1,000 regional funeral homes. The industry is being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority to see if people are being charged too much.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Kashmiri communities around the world are desperately searching for ways to contact their relatives.

      "body": "<p>England resemble the 2003 World Cup-winning team in at least one respect: the inestimable value of the player who wears the No 4 jersey. Back then it was in the possession of Martin Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/nov/23/rugbyworldcup2003.rugbyunion4\" title=\"\">the side\u2019s captain, an indomitable character</a> whose face wore the evidence of a career that started in the amateur days when the sport connived at lawlessness and duelling was a game within a game.</p> <p>The former Wales and Pontypool second-row John Perkins was the master of four\u2011play. \u201cI would always give my opposite number a whack in the opening minutes,\u201d he once said. \u201cIf there was no comeback, I knew I was in for an easy afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s career did not quite overlap with that of the Welshman: he was not known for his habit of turning the other cheek and in the second half of his career, when professionalism took root, he found himself answering charges that not 10 years before would barely have caused a referee\u2019s finger to wag.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/28/mako-vunipola-injury-world-cup-japan-tongo-italy-jack-nowell\">Mako Vunipola boost for England but Jack Nowell \u2018touch and go\u2019 for World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perkins would not get away with it now and not just because of multiple camera angles and citing officers. The awareness of the dangers of concussion has led to punching carrying a stigma: it is 50 years ago that another No 4, the Wales captain, Brian Price, felled the Ireland flanker Noel Murphy with a haymaker at Cardiff Arms Park when the Prince of Wales was part of the crowd, executing a plan to get the back-rower off the field, an act that earned no more than an admonishment from the referee. A repeat today would earn an enforced rest of several months.</p> <p>Maro Itoje does not have to be vigilant for a fist that appears from nowhere. It is the body of the current holder of the jersey worn by Johnson, rather than his face, that bears witness to the demands of the professional game. The Saracens lock epitomises the best of the modern-day player, athletic, powerful and composed, driven but in control.</p> <p>His performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/england-ireland-rugby-world-cup-warm-up-match-report\" title=\"\">against Ireland at Twickenham last Saturday</a> was Johnsonian in its impact if not in its manner. Johnson oozed competitive zeal, the first one out of the trench: when Ian McGeechan chose him as the Lions captain in 1997 for the tour to South Africa, the second-row did not then lead his country. He was tall and imposing in a series McGeechan knew would be swayed by the physical contest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcbee129c7b50e12ff4b95876fe49cf652afbf1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcbee129c7b50e12ff4b95876fe49cf652afbf1d/30_0_2045_1227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Johnson was full of competative zeal for England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Johnson was full of competative zeal for England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Walter/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Itoje\u2019s enforcing comes through his reading of the game, his rugby intelligence, and England are stronger for his presence. Manu Tuilagi was named man of the match against Ireland, understandably so for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/24/manu-tuilagi-england-ireland\" title=\"\">the impact he made with and without the ball</a>, vexing a defence that lacked its customary sharpness off the line, but it was Itoje who lubricated England\u2019s engine, from the opening minute when he forced a turnover.</p> <p>Tuilagi is conspicuous but a lot of Itoje\u2019s work is, if not unseen, barely noticed. He facilitates, winning lineouts and sabotaging the opposition, alert for opportunities after a tackle and on hand to sustain attacks. He is adding ball-carrying to his armoury and at 24 still has to peak.</p> <p>Four years ago, he was in England\u2019s training squad for the World Cup but failed to make the cut. Had Eddie Jones been the head coach then, he would surely have been chosen; not as someone likely to make the 23 for the major group matches, but as a young, hungry forward whose head would not drop if he remained on the sidelines.</p> <p>Jones said before announcing his squad for Japan that the most important positions in the 31 were the first 15 and the last four. He has gone for the largely untried and untested in the latter group, rather than experienced players who have served him well in the past three years, tyros who will not have to mask disappointment and therefore not drain squad morale.</p> <p>England\u2019s previous two World Cup campaigns were blighted by tension within the group that proved undermining. Jones is a coach for whom the World Cup provides a power surge: he has lost two matches in three tournaments, in the 2003 final to Johnson\u2019s England and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/23/scotland-japan-world-cup-2015-match-report\" title=\"\">to Scotland four years ago when he was in charge of Japan</a>.</p> <p>He appreciates the rigours of a tournament that has broken many a good team. The physical demands placed on his players since taking charge at the end of 2015 have been designed not just to make them comfortable with the ever-increasing pace and intensity of the international game, but to harden them mentally so that when they get to the closing moments of a game that is in the balance, they do not lose their heads, as they did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/26/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">against Wales</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/03/england-australia-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Australia in their home tournament in 2015</a>.</p> <p>Itoje is central to that, focused and unruffled. He has in the past conceded penalties in testing the tolerance threshold of referees at the breakdown but he did not give away one against Ireland, putting experience to advantage. He is seen as a future England captain, but he would be a Sam Warburton, leading through example and his sheer will to win, rather than a Johnson, whose demeanour camouflaged a great rugby brain that, for the past eight years, has been wastefully lost to the English game.</p> <p>Leadership was a concern for Jones a couple of years ago but now he has it covered in all areas of the pack through Jamie George, Itoje and Billy Vunipola and in Owen Farrell, George Ford and Ben Youngs behind. They are bubbling at the right time and Jones knows Japan, its climate and culture. They will be ready and they have Itoje to the fore.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Back then it was in the possession of Martin Johnson, the side\u2019s captain, an indomitable character whose face wore the evidence of a career that started in the amateur days when the sport connived at lawlessness and duelling was a game within a game. The former Wales and Pontypool second-row John Perkins was the master of four\u2011play. \u201cI would always give my opposite number a whack in the opening minutes,\u201d he once said. \u201cIf there was no comeback, I knew I was in for an easy afternoon.\u201d Johnson\u2019s career did not quite overlap with that of the Welshman: he was not known for his habit of turning the other cheek and in the second half of his career, when professionalism took root, he found himself answering charges that not 10 years before would barely have caused a referee\u2019s finger to wag. Perkins would not get away with it now and not just because of multiple camera angles and citing officers. The awareness of the dangers of concussion has led to punching carrying a stigma: it is 50 years ago that another No 4, the Wales captain, Brian Price, felled the Ireland flanker Noel Murphy with a haymaker at Cardiff Arms Park when the Prince of Wales was part of the crowd, executing a plan to get the back-rower off the field, an act that earned no more than an admonishment from the referee. A repeat today would earn an enforced rest of several months. Maro Itoje does not have to be vigilant for a fist that appears from nowhere. It is the body of the current holder of the jersey worn by Johnson, rather than his face, that bears witness to the demands of the professional game. The Saracens lock epitomises the best of the modern-day player, athletic, powerful and composed, driven but in control. His performance against Ireland at Twickenham last Saturday was Johnsonian in its impact if not in its manner. Johnson oozed competitive zeal, the first one out of the trench: when Ian McGeechan chose him as the Lions captain in 1997 for the tour to South Africa, the second-row did not then lead his country. He was tall and imposing in a series McGeechan knew would be swayed by the physical contest. Itoje\u2019s enforcing comes through his reading of the game, his rugby intelligence, and England are stronger for his presence. Manu Tuilagi was named man of the match against Ireland, understandably so for the impact he made with and without the ball, vexing a defence that lacked its customary sharpness off the line, but it was Itoje who lubricated England\u2019s engine, from the opening minute when he forced a turnover. Tuilagi is conspicuous but a lot of Itoje\u2019s work is, if not unseen, barely noticed. He facilitates, winning lineouts and sabotaging the opposition, alert for opportunities after a tackle and on hand to sustain attacks. He is adding ball-carrying to his armoury and at 24 still has to peak. Four years ago, he was in England\u2019s training squad for the World Cup but failed to make the cut. Had Eddie Jones been the head coach then, he would surely have been chosen; not as someone likely to make the 23 for the major group matches, but as a young, hungry forward whose head would not drop if he remained on the sidelines. Jones said before announcing his squad for Japan that the most important positions in the 31 were the first 15 and the last four. He has gone for the largely untried and untested in the latter group, rather than experienced players who have served him well in the past three years, tyros who will not have to mask disappointment and therefore not drain squad morale. England\u2019s previous two World Cup campaigns were blighted by tension within the group that proved undermining. Jones is a coach for whom the World Cup provides a power surge: he has lost two matches in three tournaments, in the 2003 final to Johnson\u2019s England and to Scotland four years ago when he was in charge of Japan. He appreciates the rigours of a tournament that has broken many a good team. The physical demands placed on his players since taking charge at the end of 2015 have been designed not just to make them comfortable with the ever-increasing pace and intensity of the international game, but to harden them mentally so that when they get to the closing moments of a game that is in the balance, they do not lose their heads, as they did against Wales and Australia in their home tournament in 2015. Itoje is central to that, focused and unruffled. He has in the past conceded penalties in testing the tolerance threshold of referees at the breakdown but he did not give away one against Ireland, putting experience to advantage. He is seen as a future England captain, but he would be a Sam Warburton, leading through example and his sheer will to win, rather than a Johnson, whose demeanour camouflaged a great rugby brain that, for the past eight years, has been wastefully lost to the English game. Leadership was a concern for Jones a couple of years ago but now he has it covered in all areas of the pack through Jamie George, Itoje and Billy Vunipola and in Owen Farrell, George Ford and Ben Youngs behind. They are bubbling at the right time and Jones knows Japan, its climate and culture. They will be ready and they have Itoje to the fore. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown. To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions.",

      "bodyText": "Staff at a small NGO in southern China with links to Hong Kong have been arrested on suspicion of state subversion, as authorities crack down on mainland activists with any possible connections to the protests. On Monday, lawyers for the three staff members of Changsha Funeng, a public welfare organisation focusing especially on disability rights, said the three had been formally arrested on suspicion of state subversion. The charge is unusually severe for a group that does not work on overtly political or sensitive issues. Changsha Funeng, a three-person large NGO founded in 2016, describes itself as a \u201cpublic welfare organisation\u201d advocating for the rights of vulnerable groups and government accountability through disclosure requests. \u201cIt has nothing to do with subverting the government and subverting the political system,\u201d the organisation said in a statement. In July, police detained the \u201cChangsha Three\u201d as the group is now known. On 22 July, police stormed the home of Cheng Yuan, co-founder of the NGO, in Shenzhen. Cheng\u2019s wife was taken to a neighbourhood committee office with a black hood over her head to face interrogation. The other two were arrested at their homes in Changsha. According to co-founder Yang Zhanqing, now in the US, the group had set up a company in Hong Kong through which it received funds from overseas. Cheng Yuan, who lived in Shenzhen near China\u2019s border with Hong Kong, regularly traveled to Hong Kong for meetings related to the NGO\u2019s work. Yang said the group was not affiliated with the protests. On Twitter, Liu Yongze, one of the arrested staffers, retweeted a BBC article about the protests and a comment by another user that read: \u201cHong Kong people can only fight.\u201d According to Yang, there was no indication the other two were in support of the protests. Yang said the primary reason for the arrest appears to be the group\u2019s funding, which he said did not violate any laws, but the Hong Kong protests may be another major factor. \u201cHong Kong and the anti-extradition movement has had a great impact on the mainland, so there is tighter control on mainland. It\u2019s possible they are arresting people more quickly and putting them under more severe charges,\u201d he said. The protests, started in June over a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China, have garnered support in some corners of China among liberal pockets of activists, intellectuals, and regular citizens. Several Chinese activists have been interrogated or detained for expressing support of the protests on social media. A dissident based in the southern province of Guangdong who attended the demonstrations in August was detained for 15 days when he returned. A Wechat user in Shandong province was also reportedly criminally detained for expressing his support of the protesters in Hong Kong in a Wechat group. \u201cI feel any activists or civil society groups who have somewhat foreign connects are in a dangerous situation,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher for Human Rights Watch. Rights advocates say the space for civil society in China has shrunk dramatically under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who came to power in 2012. Groups that would previously not have been deemed sensitive have been shuttered. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the real motivation is to crack down on independent civil society and rights advocacy,\u201d said Wang. \u201cThe prosecutions show that rights advocacy NGOs in China are on the verge of total elimination.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>She was meant to be the \u201cmini-Merkel\u201d who would grow to fill the German chancellor\u2019s shoes. But after a series of own goals and a poor result for her party in the European elections, and with further trouble looming in state polls in eastern Germany in early September, questions are growing over Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s ability to act as a peacemaker between the conservative and liberal wings of her party.</p> <p>Promoted first to leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 2018 and then to the post of defence minister last month, Kramp-Karrenbauer remains the most promising candidate to take over when Merkel steps down at the end of her current term.</p> <p>But if AKK, as she is known, used to enjoy a reputation as a decisive risk-taker while state leader of the Saarland region, she is now increasingly criticised for her thin skin and impulsive communicative missteps.</p> <p>In March, Kramp-Karrenbauer bewildered modernisers in her party with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/04/cdu-leader-annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-gender-neutral-bathrooms-row\">jokes about gender-neutral bathrooms</a> at a carnival event. In May, when a leading German YouTube star<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/22/german-youtuber-rezo-video-attacking-merkel-party-cdu-goes-viral\"> released a viral video</a> in which he took apart the CDU\u2019s track record in government, Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s response seemed to exacerbate rather than calm the storm.</p> <p>A joke about the CDU being held responsible for the \u201cseven plagues of Egypt\u201d backfired: did the Catholic politician really not know the Old Testament listed 10 plagues? An attempt at a more serious response, talking of the need for clearer rules for digital opinion formers, led to her being accused of trying to censor the internet.</p> <p>\u201cA few little digs are enough for AKK to break out of her reserve\u201d, wrote the newspaper <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article194474959/Annegret-Kramp-Karrenbauer-Das-Verlieren-hat-sie-nie-lernen-muessen.html\">Die Welt</a>. \u201cShe\u2019s different to chancellor Merkel, who would have just pulled the plug by refusing to take any more questions or escaping into platitudes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/29/angela-merkel-says-claims-she-thinks-her-successor-is-not-up-to-job\">Merkel seeks to scotch rumours of a rift with her party's new leader</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In June, many were irritated by the manner in which Kramp-Karrenbauer celebrated a CDU candidate beating an AfD rival to the mayorship in the town of G\u00f6rlitz, seemingly forgetting that the Green and left parties had withdrawn their candidates to put up a united front against the far right.</p> <p>And this week she faced criticism from the youth wing of the CDU for implying that she could expel a former head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency from the party.</p> <p>Talking about Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, who alarmed many of his peers by sharing far-right views in tweets and interviews, Kramp-Karrenbauer said: \u201cThere are high hurdles for expelling someone from a party, and with good reason. But in Mr Maa\u00dfen I no longer see an attitude that ties him to the CDU.\u201d</p> <p>In the same interview with Funke Media Group, she likened the Werteunion, a rightwing pressure group within the CDU of which Maa\u00dfen is a founding member, to America\u2019s Tea Party movement.</p> <p>Although Maa\u00dfen is a controversial figure in the country at large, some CDU campaigners see the former civil servant as useful in upcoming elections in Brandenburg and Saxony on 1 September, where the CDU could be defeated by the far-right AfD.</p> <p>\u201cI would have preferred us to achieve victories on the town squares of Saxony and Brandenburg\u201d, said Tilman Kuban, the leader of the CDU\u2019s youth wing, telling Deutschlandfunk radio that it was important to tolerate internal differences of opinion. \u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily expect own goals from Berlin,\u201d Kuban said. Kramp-Karrenbauer later clarified that she did not intend to expel Maa\u00dfen.</p> <p>The latest rhetorical misstep has further tarnished Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s standing in her party and prompted memories of Merkel\u2019s ability to smooth over internal divisions during her time as party leader.</p> <p>\u201cSince taking over as leader of the CDU, Kramp-Karrenbauer has worked hard to reach out to the rightwing of her party\u201d, said Kristina Dunz, a journalist for the Rheinische Post newspaper who has written a biography of the politician. \u201cBut in the process she has deserted the political centre and alienated many people who supported her candidacy in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Kramp-Karrenbauer had manoeuvred herself into a tight spot, suggested weekly Der Spiegel. \u201cThe conservatives in her party now know that they can\u2019t count on their leader. The liberals don\u2019t trust her to protect Merkel\u2019s legacy\u201d.</p> <p>The newspaper Die Zeit said of the Maa\u00dfen row: \u201cThis would never have happened to Angela Merkel. She would have simply ignored Maa\u00dfen until he lost his wit or left the party for the AfD out of his own accord.\u201d</p> <p>Opinion polls for the Saxony elections suggest the CDU could win by the narrowest of margins over the AfD. The polls put the party on 28%, compared with 39% in the last elections in the state in 2014.</p> <p>In the state of Brandenburg, also in the formerly socialist east, the party that has dominated postwar German politics could even come second behind the far right, with only 18% of the vote.</p> <p>\u201cIf the CDU drops below the AfD in Saxony and Brandenburg on 1 September, it could be the case that she has to bury her dreams of becoming chancellor\u201d, said Tilman Mayer, a political scientist at Bonn University.</p> <p>Mayer told Focus magazine that the mounting pressure on Kramp-Karrenbauer could lead to the CDU going into the next election with a more conservative candidate such as Friedrich Merz, a former CDU parliamentary leader, or a more clear-cut liberal such as the North Rhine-Westphalia premier, Armin Laschet.</p> <p>The Rheinische Post\u2019s Dunz said: \u201cIn the age of social media, it\u2019s increasingly impossible for politicians to get things right in the public eye at all. But the fact is that Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is still trying to find her feet on the national stage, and she is running out of time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "She was meant to be the \u201cmini-Merkel\u201d who would grow to fill the German chancellor\u2019s shoes. But after a series of own goals and a poor result for her party in the European elections, and with further trouble looming in state polls in eastern Germany in early September, questions are growing over Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s ability to act as a peacemaker between the conservative and liberal wings of her party. Promoted first to leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 2018 and then to the post of defence minister last month, Kramp-Karrenbauer remains the most promising candidate to take over when Merkel steps down at the end of her current term. But if AKK, as she is known, used to enjoy a reputation as a decisive risk-taker while state leader of the Saarland region, she is now increasingly criticised for her thin skin and impulsive communicative missteps. In March, Kramp-Karrenbauer bewildered modernisers in her party with jokes about gender-neutral bathrooms at a carnival event. In May, when a leading German YouTube star released a viral video in which he took apart the CDU\u2019s track record in government, Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s response seemed to exacerbate rather than calm the storm. A joke about the CDU being held responsible for the \u201cseven plagues of Egypt\u201d backfired: did the Catholic politician really not know the Old Testament listed 10 plagues? An attempt at a more serious response, talking of the need for clearer rules for digital opinion formers, led to her being accused of trying to censor the internet. \u201cA few little digs are enough for AKK to break out of her reserve\u201d, wrote the newspaper Die Welt. \u201cShe\u2019s different to chancellor Merkel, who would have just pulled the plug by refusing to take any more questions or escaping into platitudes.\u201d In June, many were irritated by the manner in which Kramp-Karrenbauer celebrated a CDU candidate beating an AfD rival to the mayorship in the town of G\u00f6rlitz, seemingly forgetting that the Green and left parties had withdrawn their candidates to put up a united front against the far right. And this week she faced criticism from the youth wing of the CDU for implying that she could expel a former head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency from the party. Talking about Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, who alarmed many of his peers by sharing far-right views in tweets and interviews, Kramp-Karrenbauer said: \u201cThere are high hurdles for expelling someone from a party, and with good reason. But in Mr Maa\u00dfen I no longer see an attitude that ties him to the CDU.\u201d In the same interview with Funke Media Group, she likened the Werteunion, a rightwing pressure group within the CDU of which Maa\u00dfen is a founding member, to America\u2019s Tea Party movement. Although Maa\u00dfen is a controversial figure in the country at large, some CDU campaigners see the former civil servant as useful in upcoming elections in Brandenburg and Saxony on 1 September, where the CDU could be defeated by the far-right AfD. \u201cI would have preferred us to achieve victories on the town squares of Saxony and Brandenburg\u201d, said Tilman Kuban, the leader of the CDU\u2019s youth wing, telling Deutschlandfunk radio that it was important to tolerate internal differences of opinion. \u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily expect own goals from Berlin,\u201d Kuban said. Kramp-Karrenbauer later clarified that she did not intend to expel Maa\u00dfen. The latest rhetorical misstep has further tarnished Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s standing in her party and prompted memories of Merkel\u2019s ability to smooth over internal divisions during her time as party leader. \u201cSince taking over as leader of the CDU, Kramp-Karrenbauer has worked hard to reach out to the rightwing of her party\u201d, said Kristina Dunz, a journalist for the Rheinische Post newspaper who has written a biography of the politician. \u201cBut in the process she has deserted the political centre and alienated many people who supported her candidacy in the first place.\u201d Kramp-Karrenbauer had manoeuvred herself into a tight spot, suggested weekly Der Spiegel. \u201cThe conservatives in her party now know that they can\u2019t count on their leader. The liberals don\u2019t trust her to protect Merkel\u2019s legacy\u201d. The newspaper Die Zeit said of the Maa\u00dfen row: \u201cThis would never have happened to Angela Merkel. She would have simply ignored Maa\u00dfen until he lost his wit or left the party for the AfD out of his own accord.\u201d Opinion polls for the Saxony elections suggest the CDU could win by the narrowest of margins over the AfD. The polls put the party on 28%, compared with 39% in the last elections in the state in 2014. In the state of Brandenburg, also in the formerly socialist east, the party that has dominated postwar German politics could even come second behind the far right, with only 18% of the vote. \u201cIf the CDU drops below the AfD in Saxony and Brandenburg on 1 September, it could be the case that she has to bury her dreams of becoming chancellor\u201d, said Tilman Mayer, a political scientist at Bonn University. Mayer told Focus magazine that the mounting pressure on Kramp-Karrenbauer could lead to the CDU going into the next election with a more conservative candidate such as Friedrich Merz, a former CDU parliamentary leader, or a more clear-cut liberal such as the North Rhine-Westphalia premier, Armin Laschet. The Rheinische Post\u2019s Dunz said: \u201cIn the age of social media, it\u2019s increasingly impossible for politicians to get things right in the public eye at all. But the fact is that Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is still trying to find her feet on the national stage, and she is running out of time.\u201d",

In a damning report castigating both the government and armed groups including the Taliban and Islamic State, Amnesty said activists and members of civil society organisations have been shot at and killed in attacks that remain uninvestigated by the authorities. It comes at a time of intense brutality and bloodshed, despite US-Taliban talks in Doha, Qatar, in July, aimed at bringing an end to the 18-year conflict. Twice-postponed presidential elections are also expected to be held in September. The plight of Afghanistan\u2019s human rights defenders have been \u201clargely ignored\u201d at home and abroad, according to the Amnesty report, which said activists are often accused of subverting religious and cultural traditions. The report, based on interviews with more than a dozen activists, said attacks and acts of intimidation are not limited to a geographic area and are taking place across the country, perpetrated both by state and non-state actors. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation that has become even more precarious of late given the enduring political uncertainty and high levels of violence that afflict the country,\u201d the report said. More people lost their lives last year than at any time since records have been kept, according to the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan. More than 3,800 civilian deaths, including 927 children, were documented. In the first half of 2019 1,366 people died and 2,446 were injured.

It is sensory overload, and an absolute blast. What we said: \u201cIt\u2019s bloody, spectacular and irresistible, all cheesy one-liners, guns, swords and explosions while guitars scream in the background, and it plays like a dream.\u201d Read the full review Resident Evil 2 A brilliant remake of the 1998 survival horror classic, providing series heroes Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield with terrifying new challenges as they explore the zombie-infested Racoon City police station. What we said: \u201cThe rhythm, gradually building from many minutes of quiet exploration and puzzle-solving to gigantic, pulverising boss battles, is exact and beautiful, like some monstrous Wagner opera.\u201d Read the full review Heaven\u2019s Vault A reluctant archaeologist sets out across a surreal galaxy at the behest of her mentor, visiting strange places and stranger people in pursuit of a lost professor. You piece together the language of an ancient civilisation as you go, but it\u2019s the sturdy writing behind the characters that envelops you in this fiction. What we said: \u201cA winding but exhilarating galactic sojourn that differs from linear fiction in that it remembers and adapts to every choice and every path you follow in order to build a story acutely individual to the player.\u201d Read the full review Hypnospace Outlaw A detective story set in a parallel-universe version of the 90s internet, at once nostalgic and wildly weird. You play an enforcer trying to track down illegal behaviour online, discovering a hilarious range of fictional internet subcultures as you work. What we said: \u201cRather than lazily pastiching the ugliness and awkwardness of turn-of-the-century web pages, it really conjures that time when the internet was a place to go rather than a liminal omnipresence.\u201d Read the full review Katana Zero Slice through nightclubs, dodgy warehouses and hotels full of crime-lord goons as a drug-addicted samurai with the power to rewind time. Stylish in both form and substance, like a video-game reimagining of Drive, it has enough narrative intrigue to pull you through its story at breakneck speed. Apex Legends Slick, colourful and unrelenting, Apex Legends burst into the battle royale genre dominated by Fortnite and attracted 25 million players before a week had passed.

It is not for the faint of heart or slow of trigger-finger.\u201d Read the full review Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice A supernatural-tinged samurai game centred on nerve-jangling, steel-meets-steel sword combat and themes of undeath, Sekiro is an extraordinary game that reveals more of its brilliance the longer you play \u2013 if you can rise to its very high difficulty level. What we said: \u201cIf you have the time and dedication to throw at its mountainous challenges, you will find here an exquisite game whose subtle themes, gradually unfurling mysteries and beautiful samurai-period sights reward the determined and skilled player.\u201d Read the full review Sunless Skies Renowned London studio Failbetter Games returns with an imaginative steam punk exploration adventure in which players pilot spacefaring locomotives across the cosmos, combatting pirates, madness and starvation. What we said: \u201cThis is a game about gradually and fearfully charting a vast, hostile space, not brashly conquering it. And there are wonderful and terrible sights out in the farthest reaches.\u201d Read the full review Metro Exodus It\u2019s the sense of place that makes Metro Exodus stand out among shooters: its postapocalyptic Russia is evocative and the pace of play is often slow and tense. You\u2019re as likely to die because of a crack in your visor as at the hands of some mutant creature. What we said: \u201cMetro Exodus\u2019s narrative explores where and how people look for hope when the world has ended \u2026 a world stunning in its devastation.\u201d Read the full review Walking Dead: The Final Series The seminal interactive fiction series draws to its violent, shocking and engrossing conclusion with teenage hero Clementine seeking to save a younger child from the undead hordes.

      "body": "<p>As long as there have been people who called themselves socialists, there have been people arguing about what socialism is. Socialism is a large, fractious family. Many of its members are not on speaking terms, or have a history of killing one another. Meltdowns are common. Differences of opinion that may seem microscopic to outsiders often serve as the basis for centuries-long shouting matches. Yet even in the most dysfunctional family, there are certain resemblances. Whether Fabian or Maoist, Eurocommunist or anarcho-syndicalist, socialists share the desire to create a world without capitalism.</p> <p>What would such a world look like? And how might we get from here to there? Until recently, very few people in the US and the UK were interested in debating these questions. Socialist movements were in deep retreat. The possibility of a world without capitalism seemed preposterous. In recent years, this possibility has started to look less preposterous. New leftwing momentum in both countries, propelled by popular upheavals and the campaigns of politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, has put socialist ideas back into circulation. Poll after poll demonstrates the rising popularity of the term. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/10/america-socialism-capitalism-poll-axios\" title=\"\">Forty per cent of Americans</a> now say they would rather live in a socialist country than a capitalist one.</p> <p>One could ask what the respondents mean by socialism \u2013 but this is always the question. Competing answers are currently being hashed out in spaces large and small: presidential campaign speeches, Twitter threads, big newspapers, little magazines. Now an important contribution to the conversation has arrived in the form of a new book by the recently deceased Erik Olin Wright, one of America\u2019s best known and most beloved Marxist intellectuals.</p> <p><em>How to Be an Anticapitalist in the 21st Century</em> deserves to be widely read. In 150-odd pages, Wright makes the case for what\u2019s wrong with capitalism, what would be better, and how to achieve it.

      "bodyText": "As long as there have been people who called themselves socialists, there have been people arguing about what socialism is. Socialism is a large, fractious family. Many of its members are not on speaking terms, or have a history of killing one another. Meltdowns are common. Differences of opinion that may seem microscopic to outsiders often serve as the basis for centuries-long shouting matches. Yet even in the most dysfunctional family, there are certain resemblances. Whether Fabian or Maoist, Eurocommunist or anarcho-syndicalist, socialists share the desire to create a world without capitalism. What would such a world look like? And how might we get from here to there? Until recently, very few people in the US and the UK were interested in debating these questions. Socialist movements were in deep retreat. The possibility of a world without capitalism seemed preposterous. In recent years, this possibility has started to look less preposterous. New leftwing momentum in both countries, propelled by popular upheavals and the campaigns of politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, has put socialist ideas back into circulation. Poll after poll demonstrates the rising popularity of the term. Forty per cent of Americans now say they would rather live in a socialist country than a capitalist one. One could ask what the respondents mean by socialism \u2013 but this is always the question. Competing answers are currently being hashed out in spaces large and small: presidential campaign speeches, Twitter threads, big newspapers, little magazines. Now an important contribution to the conversation has arrived in the form of a new book by the recently deceased Erik Olin Wright, one of America\u2019s best known and most beloved Marxist intellectuals. How to Be an Anticapitalist in the 21st Century deserves to be widely read. In 150-odd pages, Wright makes the case for what\u2019s wrong with capitalism, what would be better, and how to achieve it. This is the rare book that can speak to both the faithful and the unconverted. You could buy it for your sceptical uncle or your militant cousin: there is something here for the reader who needs persuading that another world is possible, and the reader who wants ideas for bringing that world into being. Wright writes with an unusual combination of clarity, depth and warmth. He engages generously with opposing arguments. He acknowledges difficulty and complexity.

      "bodyText": "The two migrant workers who were found guilty of the murders of two British backpackers on the Thai island of Koh Tao have had their convictions upheld by the country\u2019s supreme court. In December 2015, Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were sentenced to death after being found guilty of the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and the murder of 24-year-old David Miller, from Jersey, on the island popular with tourists and backpackers. The pair, who had met at a diving resort on the island just days earlier, were found on a quiet beach with fatal head wounds in September 2014. The guilty verdict had already been upheld at a lower court in 2017. However, the final appealat the supreme court ruled the men had been found guilty of murder and rape on the basis of evidence and forensic results. They displayed no emotion as they listened intently to an interpreter while the verdict was read at a court in the province of Nonthaburi, just north of the capital, Bangkok. The men\u2019s legal team said it would seek a royal pardon within 60 days, as provided in Thai law. Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, who are migrant workers from Myanmar, have always maintained their innocence and there have been accusations of multiple police failings throughout the case. Rights groups have said the pair were used as scapegoats by the authorities, as is a common occurrence for migrant workers living in Thailand, allegedly because the police were under pressure to solve a crime that made international headlines. The police were accused of torturing the pair to extract confessions, claiming they had committed the crime out of sexual jealousy after seeing Witheridge and Miller together on a beach.

      "bodyText": "What does the bill do? The religious discrimination bill prohibits discrimination in certain areas of public life on the ground of religious belief or activity. While the bill does not define protected religious \u201cactivity\u201d, the explanatory notes confirm it has a broad meaning including religious observance, dress and expression of religious belief, especially where \u201cadherents of that religious group are required, or encouraged, to evangelise\u201d. The bill prohibits both direct discrimination, treating another person less favourably based on religion, and indirect discrimination where an apparently neutral condition has the effect of disadvantaging people based on religion. As expected, the bill also creates a religious freedom commissioner, who will promote religious freedom. Good news for Israel Folau? Indirect discrimination is only banned where the condition imposed \u201cis not reasonable\u201d, such as where it is disproportionate to the aim of a rule. The extent to which it would \u201climit the ability of an employee of the employer to have or engage in the employee\u2019s religious belief or activity\u201d is also a factor. But where a large business \u2013 with a turnover of $50m or more \u2013 claims that an employment conduct rule that \u201cwould restrict or prevent an employee from making statements of belief in their private capacity, the business is required to prove that compliance with the condition is necessary to avoid unjustifiable financial hardship to the business\u201d. The attorney general, Christian Porter, said the bill provides \u201can extra protection to people subject to an employer rule\u201d in circumstances such as Israel Folau\u2019s. To take the Folau example, Rugby Australia would have to show financial hardship, such as loss of sponsorship, to avoid a finding that it is discriminatory to impose a condition on Folau not to post on social media about sexuality and sin. How this would work in practice is hard to say: the division of a person\u2019s employment-related and private capacity is notoriously difficult, particularly in the social media age. What does this do to state discrimination laws? The bill protects expression of religious speech in good faith by stating that such speech does not constitute discrimination under commonwealth, state or territory anti-discrimination law and does not contravene subsection 17(1) of the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Act 1998. That provision bans speech that \u201coffends, insults or humiliates\u201d people based on a range of grounds including gender, race, age, sexual orientation, disability and relationship status. To the extent of inconsistency the federal law applies, so the new bill could provide greater protection to speech like: that gay people are going to hell, that disabled people are possessed, that pregnant unmarried women are sinners. However, this provision does not protect statements that are \u201cmalicious, would harass, vilify or incite hatred or violence against a person or group or which advocate for the commission of a serious criminal offence\u201d. Good news for Archbishop Porteous? The explanatory notes claim the override of Tasmanian law was necessary \u201cgiven its broad scope and demonstrated ability to affect freedom of religious expression\u201d. Coalition conservatives have cited the case of Archbishop Julian Porteous \u2013 who had a discrimination complaint against him for anti same-sex marriage leaflets arguing that \u201cmessing with marriage is messing with kids\u201d \u2013 as evidence of the need to override state laws. The bill essentially lifts the bar for a successful complaint from the offend, insult or humiliate threshold to requiring the expression of religious belief be malicious or that it would harass, vilify or incite hatred against a group. Porter said that it \u201chighly doubtful\u201d that paraphrasing scripture even \u201cclumsily\u201d would constitute discriminatory hate speech. Are there exceptions? Yes! Lots! The one big exception is that religious bodies can discriminate on the grounds of religion where their conduct is \u201cin good faith, [and] may reasonably be regarded as being in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of their religion\u201d. However, the bill does not provide religious bodies with a broader defence or exemption from other commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation, such as the Sex Discrimination Act. So religious schools could refuse to hire somebody who does not adhere to that religion, but the bill doesn\u2019t licence sacking or refusing to hire a gay teacher. The issue of when religion can be used as a defence to other discrimination laws is currently the subject of an inquiry by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Expression of religious belief that counsels, promotes, encourages or urges conduct that would constitute a serious offence is also not protected. There is an exception for discrimination on the basis that a person is unable to carry out the inherent requirements of the work because of their religious belief or activity. There are also general exceptions for: charities conferring benefits based on religion; conduct in direct compliance with commonwealth, state or territory legislation; law enforcement, national security or intelligence functions; and compliance with court and tribunal orders and determinations. What do the other two bills do? The religious discrimination bill is one of three bills. The second, the Religious Discrimination (Consequential Amendments) bill 2019 makes minor changes including to give the AHRC the power to inquire into and conciliate complaints of unlawful religious discrimination. The third, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment (Freedom of Religion) bill 2019 amends other federal discrimination laws to add new objectives: \u201cthe indivisibility and universality of human rights\u201d and \u201cthe principle that every person is free and equal in dignity and rights\u201d. This is the omnibus bill which the Coalition suggested would provide \u201cequal status\u201d to freedom of religion alongside the right to non-discrimination. This bill also enacts Ruddock review recommendations: amending the Marriage Act to provide protections for religious educational institutions by clarifying that the religious educational institution may lawfully refuse to provide goods, services or facilities for the solemnisation of a marriage amending the Charities Act 2013 to clarify that the advocacy of traditional views of marriage by charitable institutions will not disqualify the charitable institution from being a charity.",

As revealed by Guardian Australia, the bill includes clauses relating to indirect discrimination, which is where \u201can apparently neutral condition has the effect of disadvantaging people of a particular religious belief or who engage in a particular religious activity\u201d. This imposes additional requirements on large businesses with a turnover of more than $50m to not put in place standards or conditions that limit religious expression in a person\u2019s \u201cprivate capacity\u201d, unless the business can prove it would cause \u201cunjustifiable financial hardship to the business\u201d. If the business is unable to demonstrate that the condition is necessary to avoid unjustifiable financial hardship, the condition is not reasonable, and is therefore discriminatory, according to the new law. Porter said this would provide an \u201cextra protection\u201d for an employee faced with the same circumstances as Folau\u2019s. Protected religious activity is not defined in the bill but the explanatory note states that \u201cexpression of a religious belief\u201d may be included. \u201cFor example, evangelising may constitute a religious activity where adherents of that religious group are required, or encouraged, to evangelise,\u201d it said. In July, Porter claimed the bill was \u201cnot intended to displace state law\u201d, responding to concerns from LGBT advocates warning it could undermine state protections against vilification. The bill, released on Thursday, explicitly overrides Tasmania\u2019s Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits statements which \u201coffend, insult or humiliate\u201d based on protected grounds including gender, race, age, sexual orientation, disability and relationship status. Provided a person is expressing a genuinely held religious belief in good faith, that Tasmanian provision will not apply \u2013 breaching Porter\u2019s commitment in a bid to pacify Coalition conservatives who demanded the law prevent a repeat of the Porteous case, in which the Catholic archbishop of Hobart was sued over anti same-sex marriage leaflets. The explanatory memorandum claims the Tasmanian law needs to be overridden \u201cgiven its broad scope and demonstrated ability to affect freedom of religious expression\u201d. However, religious beliefs will not be protected if their expression is malicious, would harass, vilify or incite hatred against a group or advocate for the commission of a serious criminal offence. Ahead of releasing the bill, Porter said that religious Australians were not immune from \u201cviolence or vilification\u201d. \u201cThe government has endeavoured to carefully understand what are the actual problems and reasonably held concerns that are manifest for individual Australians who rightfully wish to express their faith,\u201d Porter said. But he said the government had rejected calls from some for positive rights to be enshrined in the new act, saying the legislation was best described as a \u201cshield\u201d approach. \u201cRights positively expressed are powerful swords, but they are always dual-edged swords,\u201d he said. The attorney general said the protection from discrimination in the bill would extend from education to employment and the provision of commonwealth programs and services. \u201cJust because a protective shield is simple does not mean that it is unimportant,\u201d Porter said. \u201cEqually, that a protection is simple need not mean that it is controversial.\u201d Porter said the legislation would now be subject to further consultation with a wide range of interested parties before settling on a final bill. It is expected they will be introduced in October and considered by both the House and Senate before the end of the calendar year, allowing time for a Senate inquiry.",

If your PC takes a couple of hours to render a video, you\u2019re not going to try a lot of options. If it takes a couple of minutes, you will. In fact, some pros build \u201c<a href=\"https://www.toolfarm.com/tutorial/in_depth_render_farms_network_rendering_2018_edition/\">render farms</a>\u201d to do jobs that can take too long on a PC, such as 3D work and After Effects.

Most people do not need a fast processor most of the time, but when I\u2019m processing videos, all six cores in my Core i5-8400 run at close to 100% for extended periods. I could certainly use more.</p> <p>Not so long ago, \u201cdual core\u201d chips were a thing, and then we got cores that could run two threads at once. Today, Intel\u2019s Core i9-9900K and AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 2700X have eight cores and 16 threads, while the Ryzen Threadripper 2 2990WX has 32 cores and 64 threads. For most purposes, including video editing and gaming, it\u2019s generally better to have faster cores (more GHz) rather than more slower cores. For consumers, eight is a very good number.</p> <p>The eight-core Intel Core i7-9700 is the first choice at this level. The older Core i7-8700K and the classic Core i7-7700 still perform well if you can get them at a discount. From the AMD Zen range, the Ryzen 7 2700 and 2700X (both 8C/16T) seem to be good value, while the Ryzen 5 2600 and 2600X (both 6C/12T) offer lots of threads for a low price.</p> <p>Notebookcheck\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Processors-Benchmark-List.2436.0.html\">comparison of </a><a href=\"https://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Processors-Benchmark-List.2436.0.html\">mobile </a><a href=\"https://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Processors-Benchmark-List.2436.0.html\">processors</a> provides a rough guide to the relative performance of more than 1,400 processors. Something in the top 25 would be great, if you can afford it.

These start slower and may still be <a href=\"https://www.extremetech.com/computing/273917-cpu-throttling\">throttled for overheating</a>. For example, the <a href=\"https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/52209/intel-core-i5-2500-processor-6m-cache-up-to-3-70-ghz.html\">Core i5-2500</a> processor I bought in 2011 is still <a href=\"https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-8550U-vs-Intel-Core-i5-2500/m320742vsm517\">slightly faster</a> than a Core i7-8550U or Ryzen 5 2500U from 2017, and probably hammers this month\u2019s 10th-generation Intel Core i7-10510Y. The U is a clue. My i5-2500 ran at a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power\">TDP</a> of 95W, whereas today\u2019s U-type chips are designed to run at 15W in laptops. The Core i7-10510Y runs at a miserly 7W.</p> <p>The desktop tower\u2019s other major advantage is that it\u2019s easy to upgrade by adding more memory, storage and better graphics cards. It\u2019s harder to change the processor, and new Intel CPUs often need new support chips, which means a new motherboard. (AMD can be a bit kinder.)</p> <p>Video editing also benefits from having lots of memory (RAM) and at least two fast storage devices.</p> <p>For professional editors, 32GB is not a lot of memory, but it\u2019s the sensible minimum. For beginners, 8GB is the minimum, as long as you can increase it to 16GB or 32GB later.</p> <p>For storage, you need both speed and space. SSDs are fast, but big ones are costly, so it makes sense to have two drives. Project source files should be on the fastest 256GB or larger SSD, preferably M.2. You can write files to a slower device, such as a 1TB or larger hard drive.</p> <p>Graphics cards vary from pointless to indispensable, depending on the software you are using, and what you are doing with it. Historically, the best Quadro <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html#gpu-acceleration\">cards for running Premiere Pro</a> have been expensive. Happily, most people can now use GeForce cards designed for the gaming market, where sales volumes are high and competition drives down prices.

First, you could buy a desktop PC from one of the major brands such as Dell, HP or Lenovo, in a shop or online. Second, you could build your own, but you\u2019d have to invest a lot of time in choosing parts, unless you follow someone else\u2019s build from <a href=\"https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/guide/\">PC Partpicker</a>. Third, you could buy from a small but well-established British PC manufacturer such as <a href=\"https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/desktop-pcs/video-editing-computers/\">PC Specialist</a> or <a href=\"https://www.chillblast.com/\">Chillblast</a>. They build PCs to order from a wide range of parts, and prices are reasonable. You get the flexibility of a DIY build without the risk or the aggravation.</p> <p>The fourth option is to shop around for a refurbished workstation that has been retired by a large corporation. Look for systems with Intel Xeon or Core i7 processors and Nvidia Quadro graphics cards that are still recommended for Adobe Premiere. These can go for low prices because they don\u2019t appeal to gamers and they\u2019re overkill for most consumers. You can find them at places like <a href=\"https://www.tier1online.com/\">Tier1Online</a> and on eBay, but supplies and prices are variable. HP\u2019s Z range and Dell Precision workstations are among the best. Just make sure you don\u2019t get one with a slow processor.</p> <p>Tier1Online currently has a <a href=\"https://www.develop3d.com/workstations/dell-precision-t76001\">Dell Precision T7600</a> with two fast eight-core Xeon processors, 192GB of memory, three SSDs and a Quadro K4000. It\u2019s beyond your daughter\u2019s needs and your budget at <a href=\"https://www.tier1online.com/292-dell-precision-t7600/refurb-dell-precision-t7600-workstation-2x-intel-xeon-hexa-core-e5-2667-2-90ghz-192gb-ram-3x-256gb-ssd-nvidia-quadro-k4000-dvd-rw\">\u00a31,399</a>, but those Xeons used to cost $2,000 each.</p> <h2><strong>Possible options</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d459df8512846553f8611e057b8a27828385412\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d459df8512846553f8611e057b8a27828385412/142_0_2656_1594/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HP\u2019s Omen Obelisk gaming PC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HP\u2019s Omen Obelisk gaming PC comes in a variety of configurations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first problem with mass-market desktops is that most ship with 8GB or less memory. This might be enough for your daughter, but check with Crucial to make sure you can add at least another 8GB. For example, HP\u2019s <a href=\"https://store.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Offer.aspx?p=c-hp-omen-obelisk\">Omen Obelisk</a> (875-0005na) is a good, cheap games PC with a Core i5-8400, 8GB, GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card, 128GB M.2 SSD and 1TB hard drive for <a href=\"https://store.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=5MM75EA&amp;opt=ABU&amp;sel=DTP\">\u00a3839</a> (with \u00a360 off). You could install another 8GB module in an empty slot for <a href=\"https://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en/compatible-upgrade-for/HP---Compaq/omen-obelisk-875-0005na\">\u00a335.99</a>.</p> <p>Oddly enough, Currys PC World has Omens with 16GB, and every part of the specification is better. For example, its Omen 875-0051na has a newer, faster i7-9700F, 16GB of memory, a superior <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060\">GeForce RTX 2060</a> with its own 6GB of memory, 256GB SSD and 2TB hard drive for \u00a31,299. This would be my pick were it not for the budget-busting price.</p> <p>You can squeak under budget by compromising on the processor. Currys, for example, has a 16GB <a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/pc-specialist-vortex-gx-intel-core-i5-gtx-1660-ti-gaming-pc-2-tb-hdd-240-gb-ssd-10193558-pdt.html\">PC Specialist Vortex</a> with a Core i5-9400F, GeForce GTX 1660Ti, 240GB SSD and 2TB HDD for \u00a3999. This is a popular specification, if you want to shop around. For example, Argos has a similar <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/2990156\">Acer Nitro N50-600</a> on offer at \u00a3899.99.</p> <p>It\u2019s much the same story at Chillblast, where its pre-built <a href=\"https://www.chillblast.com/chillblast-fusion-core-i7-custom-video-photo-editing-pc-7.html?category_id=415\">photo- and </a><a href=\"https://www.chillblast.com/chillblast-fusion-core-i7-custom-video-photo-editing-pc-7.html?category_id=415\">video-editing PC</a> has almost the right spec (Core i7-9700K and 16GB but no RTX 2060, which has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA\">more CUDA cores</a>) at the \u201cwrong\u201d price, \u00a31,299.99. I\u2019m recommending this to another video-editing reader, Janet, whose budget is up to \u00a32,500, but whose needs are far more modest (running Movavi Video Editor).</p> <p>I\u2019d encourage a grown up with \u00a31,000 and a serious interest in video editing to save up for a bit longer. For a 13-year-old beginner, I\u2019d get at least a Core i5-8400, 8GB and a graphics card that is on <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html#gpu-acceleration\">Adobe\u2019s list</a>, then upgrade parts as and when needed. It will be a huge improvement on what she\u2019s using today.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question?

For example, HP\u2019s Omen Obelisk (875-0005na) is a good, cheap games PC with a Core i5-8400, 8GB, GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card, 128GB M.2 SSD and 1TB hard drive for \u00a3839 (with \u00a360 off). You could install another 8GB module in an empty slot for \u00a335.99. Oddly enough, Currys PC World has Omens with 16GB, and every part of the specification is better. For example, its Omen 875-0051na has a newer, faster i7-9700F, 16GB of memory, a superior GeForce RTX 2060 with its own 6GB of memory, 256GB SSD and 2TB hard drive for \u00a31,299. This would be my pick were it not for the budget-busting price. You can squeak under budget by compromising on the processor. Currys, for example, has a 16GB PC Specialist Vortex with a Core i5-9400F, GeForce GTX 1660Ti, 240GB SSD and 2TB HDD for \u00a3999. This is a popular specification, if you want to shop around. For example, Argos has a similar Acer Nitro N50-600 on offer at \u00a3899.99. It\u2019s much the same story at Chillblast, where its pre-built photo- and video-editing PC has almost the right spec (Core i7-9700K and 16GB but no RTX 2060, which has more CUDA cores) at the \u201cwrong\u201d price, \u00a31,299.99. I\u2019m recommending this to another video-editing reader, Janet, whose budget is up to \u00a32,500, but whose needs are far more modest (running Movavi Video Editor). I\u2019d encourage a grown up with \u00a31,000 and a serious interest in video editing to save up for a bit longer. For a 13-year-old beginner, I\u2019d get at least a Core i5-8400, 8GB and a graphics card that is on Adobe\u2019s list, then upgrade parts as and when needed. It will be a huge improvement on what she\u2019s using today. Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com",

The motif of the \u201claburnum tree\u201d that grew in the family\u2019s garden \u201cwith its beauteous blooms and poisonous seeds\u201d recurs when Sissay narrates his time with the foster family. The oppositional quality of the symbol is apt. In part, his childhood days glowed with innocence. Plucky and \u201cextrovert\u201d, he enjoyed \u201cthe Market, the Flower Park, the Big Park. The church. My friends\u201d as well as \u201cCurly Wurlys, R Whites Lemonade. A quarter of Bon Bons\u201d. Yet at school he encountered violent racist bullying. The foster home felt to him a dark place in which a fire-and-brimstone brand of Christianity held sway. He came to believe he was unwanted by his birth mother and that his foster parents were the only people willing to take in a \u201ccoloured\u201d baby. As time went on, he felt increasingly estranged from them. When he was 12, tensions peaked and he was sent to a children\u2019s home.</p> <p>He would spend the next five years \u2013 during which time his mental health deteriorated \u2013 in a succession of these loveless facilities. With unflinching acuity, he details his time in the last of these institutions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/28/lemn-sissay-life-in-care-almost-broke-me\" title=\"\">Wood End assessment centre</a>. A \u201cdystopian\u201d place where officers meted out the most horrific abuse, Wood End was a remand centre where Wigan\u2019s social services department dumped helpless children it deemed problematic. As evidenced by the survivors\u2019 testimonies that Sissay incorporates into the text, it marked and destroyed the lives of many of the young men sent there.</p> <p><em>My Name Is Why</em> consists predominantly of Sissay\u2019s chronological meditations on his experiences of the care system. Chapters are prefaced by gnomic poems, many of which speak of the resilience and hopefulness necessary to emerge from what he endured; they also help propel our thoughts towards his brighter future. The narrative is interspersed with grainy facsimiles of social workers\u2019 reports and letters that give the institutional version of events, replete with \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201cmisdirection\u201d, which Sissay probes, rebuts, corrects.</p> <p>He introduces the memoir by outlining his 34-year campaign to retrieve these records from Wigan council. He was finally granted access to them in 2015. There are some flashes of sensitivity and feeling in the official records, particularly those of his early teenage years. In the main, however, the documents show how organisations purportedly operating with young people\u2019s best interests at heart so often failed to offer meaningful, compassionate support as they struggled to make sense of their identities and origins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/26/lemn-sissay-interview-foster-child-poet-chancellor-manchester-university\">Lemn Sissay, foster child, poet and university chancellor: \u2018Everything I know about myself comes from Manchester\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Halfway through the text, Sissay tells of a trip to the twinkling lights of Blackpool. It\u2019s December 1980 and, aged 13, along with others from children\u2019s home, he is taken to see a pantomime starring a young Lenny Henry. In the surreal recounting of this day out \u2013 complete with images of Henry crowd surfing \u2013 Sissay offers a sobering consideration of both autobiography as a form and the particular challenges he faces as a autobiographer:</p> <blockquote> <em>Memories in care</em> <em> are slippery because there\u2019s no one to recall them as the years pass. In a few months I would be in a different home with a different set of people who had no idea of this moment. How could it matter if no one recalls it? Given that staff don\u2019t take photographs it was impossible to take something away as a memory. This is how you become invisible. It is the underlying unkindness that you don\u2019t matter enough. This is how you quietly deplete the sense of self-worth deep inside a child\u2019s psyche.</em>This is how a child becomes hidden in plain sight. </blockquote> <p><em> </em></p> <p>The great triumph of this work comes from its author\u2019s determination to rail against what he rightly diagnoses as this institutionally endorsed disremembering of black and marginalised experience.

The motif of the \u201claburnum tree\u201d that grew in the family\u2019s garden \u201cwith its beauteous blooms and poisonous seeds\u201d recurs when Sissay narrates his time with the foster family. The oppositional quality of the symbol is apt. In part, his childhood days glowed with innocence. Plucky and \u201cextrovert\u201d, he enjoyed \u201cthe Market, the Flower Park, the Big Park. The church. My friends\u201d as well as \u201cCurly Wurlys, R Whites Lemonade. A quarter of Bon Bons\u201d. Yet at school he encountered violent racist bullying. The foster home felt to him a dark place in which a fire-and-brimstone brand of Christianity held sway. He came to believe he was unwanted by his birth mother and that his foster parents were the only people willing to take in a \u201ccoloured\u201d baby. As time went on, he felt increasingly estranged from them. When he was 12, tensions peaked and he was sent to a children\u2019s home. He would spend the next five years \u2013 during which time his mental health deteriorated \u2013 in a succession of these loveless facilities. With unflinching acuity, he details his time in the last of these institutions, Wood End assessment centre. A \u201cdystopian\u201d place where officers meted out the most horrific abuse, Wood End was a remand centre where Wigan\u2019s social services department dumped helpless children it deemed problematic. As evidenced by the survivors\u2019 testimonies that Sissay incorporates into the text, it marked and destroyed the lives of many of the young men sent there. My Name Is Why consists predominantly of Sissay\u2019s chronological meditations on his experiences of the care system. Chapters are prefaced by gnomic poems, many of which speak of the resilience and hopefulness necessary to emerge from what he endured; they also help propel our thoughts towards his brighter future. The narrative is interspersed with grainy facsimiles of social workers\u2019 reports and letters that give the institutional version of events, replete with \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201cmisdirection\u201d, which Sissay probes, rebuts, corrects. He introduces the memoir by outlining his 34-year campaign to retrieve these records from Wigan council. He was finally granted access to them in 2015. There are some flashes of sensitivity and feeling in the official records, particularly those of his early teenage years. In the main, however, the documents show how organisations purportedly operating with young people\u2019s best interests at heart so often failed to offer meaningful, compassionate support as they struggled to make sense of their identities and origins. Halfway through the text, Sissay tells of a trip to the twinkling lights of Blackpool. It\u2019s December 1980 and, aged 13, along with others from children\u2019s home, he is taken to see a pantomime starring a young Lenny Henry. In the surreal recounting of this day out \u2013 complete with images of Henry crowd surfing \u2013 Sissay offers a sobering consideration of both autobiography as a form and the particular challenges he faces as a autobiographer: Memories in care are slippery because there\u2019s no one to recall them as the years pass. In a few months I would be in a different home with a different set of people who had no idea of this moment. How could it matter if no one recalls it? Given that staff don\u2019t take photographs it was impossible to take something away as a memory. This is how you become invisible. It is the underlying unkindness that you don\u2019t matter enough. This is how you quietly deplete the sense of self-worth deep inside a child\u2019s psyche.This is how a child becomes hidden in plain sight. The great triumph of this work comes from its author\u2019s determination to rail against what he rightly diagnoses as this institutionally endorsed disremembering of black and marginalised experience. It is a searing and unforgettable re-creation of the most brutal of beginnings. \u2022 Michael Donkor\u2019s Hold is published by 4th Estate. My Name Is Why is published by Canongate (\u00a316.99).

      "bodyText": "Rebel MPs from across the political spectrum are gearing up for a historic parliamentary clash next week, after Boris Johnson announced plans to suspend parliament for a critical five-week period in the run-up to Brexit. Conservative and opposition MPs took part in a series of hastily convened conference calls on Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to prevent a no-deal outcome, after the prime minister confirmed he had obtained permission from the Queen to prorogue parliament. The surprise decision provoked widespread fury, with Commons Speaker John Bercow describing it as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. Robert Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said Whitehall would have to think carefully about whether to put ministers\u2019 instructions into effect. \u201cWe are reaching the point where the civil service must consider putting its stewardship of the country ahead of service to the government of the day,\u201d he said. In a letter to MPs, Johnson insisted the suspension would allow him to focus on his domestic priorities of funding the NHS and tackling violent crime, and parliament would have \u201cample\u201d time to debate Brexit \u2013 but it was widely seen as a bid to curtail MPs\u2019 chances to bind his hands. The cross-party rebel alliance agreed to focus on fast-tracking legislation aimed at mandating the prime minister to request an extension to article 50 if he fails to strike a new Brexit deal by mid-October. The fresh scramble to prevent a no-deal Brexit came on a day of extraordinary drama, as: \u2022 The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, flew to Balmoral to receive the Queen\u2019s formal approval for the prorogation plan at a meeting of the privy council. \u2022 Sterling tumbled by more than 1 cent against the US dollar, as investors interpreted Johnson\u2019s ploy as heightening the risks of a no-deal Brexit, before rallying later in the day to close 0.5 cents down. \u2022 Senior EU figures were taken aback, with the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, calling the move, \u201csinister\u201d. \u2022 A petition against the suspension of parliament rapidly exceeded 800,000 signatures. \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn protested against the move in a letter to the Queen. \u2022 Lawyers for the activist Gina Miller made an urgent application to the high court for a judicial review of the prime minister\u2019s decision. Parliament will now sit for little more than a week from 3 September, before breaking until 14 October, when a new Queen\u2019s speech will be held setting out what Johnson called \u201ca bold and ambitious domestic legislative agenda for the renewal of our country after Brexit\u201d. In practice, given MPs do not sit on most Fridays, they are only likely to lose between four and six sitting days in parliament. MPs would have been due to hold conference recess anyway, from 12 September until 7 October. But Johnson\u2019s gambit squeezes the time available for rebel MPs to act. Their numbers have been boosted by the departure from cabinet of key members of the \u201cGaukeward squad\u201d, including former chancellor Philip Hammond, who is expected to spearhead next week\u2019s efforts. \u201cAt a time of national crisis parliament must be able to meet to hold the government to account and to represent our constituents and it is profoundly undemocratic to shut parliament down to stop it doing its job,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cWe are determined parliament will show its resolve to stop a no-deal Brexit \u2026 We will have to try to do something when parliament returns next week.\u201d He could table a vote of no-confidence in Johnson\u2019s government; but Labour have repeatedly said they would not do so unless they were convinced of success \u2013 which is deemed unlikely while potential Tory rebels are focused on blocking no deal through legislation. Donald Trump waded into the row on Wednesday, fresh from showering praise on Johnson at the G7 summit in Biarritz over the weekend. The US president claimed it would be \u201cvery hard\u201d for Corbyn to win a no-confidence vote, because Johnson was \u201cexactly what the UK has been looking for\u201d. One senior Labour figure speculated that Johnson\u2019s rationale might be to show that he had been forced into a general election. \u201cBuckle up, summer\u2019s over,\u201d he said. But Downing Street insists Johnson is focused on getting a new deal with the EU; and is determined not to go to the polls before Brexit day, even if he loses a vote of no confidence. \u201cWe have been very clear that if there\u2019s a no-confidence vote, he won\u2019t resign. We get to set an election date. We don\u2019t want an election, but if we have to set a date, it\u2019s going to be after 31 October,\u201d said a senior government source. The first hint that something was afoot came when the chancellor, Sajid Javid, cancelled a major speech planned for Wednesday, announcing instead that a slimmed-down spending review will take place next week. Johnson\u2019s cabinet, which is packed with veterans of the Vote Leave campaign, were only informed of the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament in a conference call on Wednesday morning \u2013 after Johnson had already made a request to the Queen. Downing Street insisted this had been the standard approach to planning a Queen\u2019s speech for previous governments. During the conference call, the prime minister stuck resolutely to the line that the suspension was simply aimed at paving the way for his new government to press on with its domestic agenda. No dissent was expressed, the Guardian understands \u2013 though one senior Tory source said Amber Rudd was \u201cmore reserved\u201d than others. They described the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, as \u201centhusiastic as Andrea Leadsom\u201d in supporting the plan. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, faced ridicule on Twitter, with his letter to fellow candidates during the Tory leadership contest calling on them to rule out prorogation being widely shared. Hancock warned in the letter that \u201ca policy on Brexit to prorogue parliament would mean the end of the Conservative party as a serious party of government\u201d. Allies said he had been referring to the more drastic proposal of proroguing parliament through to exit day \u2013 and believes narrowing the window in which MPs can debate and vote on an improved Brexit deal could help it to pass, by sharpening the dilemma for MPs. The rebels\u2019 plan for averting a no-deal Brexit leans heavily on Bercow\u2019s assistance. In an extraordinary intervention for the Speaker, whose role demands political neutrality, Bercow said Johnson\u2019s move was a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. \u201cHowever it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI have had no contact from the government, but if the reports that it is seeking to prorogue parliament are confirmed, this move represents a constitutional outrage.\u201d The rebels believe Bercow, who is often accused of trying to thwart Brexit by Eurosceptic MPs, will grant a request for an emergency backbench debate \u2013 known as an SO24 \u2013 on the the first day parliament returns, 3 September. An amendable motion could then be voted on in a matter of days. If successful it would pass to the Lords who would be required to sit in emergency sessions over the weekend of 7 and 8 September. It must have received royal assent before parliament is prorogued, or the Commons would have to start again from scratch when parliament returns on 14 October.

Johnson said MPs would get the opportunity to vote on the outcome of the key 17 October European council meeting, at which he hopes a new Brexit deal will be agreed, during the following week, on 21 and 22 October \u2013 little more than a week before exit day. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 August 2019.

The island\u2019s 3.2 million inhabitants also depend on an unstable power grid that remains prone to outages since it was destroyed by Maria. Power outages and flooding were reported across the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands and the Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra after Dorian hit St Thomas as a Category 1 storm. \u201cWe\u2019re happy because there are no damages to report,\u201d Culebra\u2019s mayor, William Solis, told the Associated Press, noting that only one community lost power.

Dennis Feltgen, a Hurricane Center meteorologist in Miami, said Dorian may grow in size and could land anywhere from south Florida to South Carolina on Sunday or Monday. \u201cThis will be a large storm approaching the south-east,\u201d he said.

An official report criticized the Trump administration\u2019s slow response to the devastation from the storm, which destroyed the island\u2019s power grid and decimated its agriculture and tourism industries. On Tuesday morning, Trump had tweeted about Dorian, and seemed to complain about the cost of hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, which have fallen far short of restoring the island. \u201cWow!

Spending on recovery for Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana in the same storm season as Maria, has so far cost $125bn. Since Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled with political turbulence leading to the recent departure of the governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3. Earlier this month, the territory\u2019s supreme court overturned the swearing-in of Rossell\u00f3\u2019s successor, Pedro Pierluisi, and the former justice secretary, Wanda V\u00e1zquez, became governor.",

This is evidently a pied-\u00e0-terre kept by her extremely well-off parents, who have a country place in north Norfolk. Her mother sometimes pops in after shopping expeditions, and is always having to \u201clend\u201d Julie money for her film projects, yet Julie is charmingly open about her advantages in life.</p> <p>Then the vampiric figure of Anthony makes his appearance. He is a supercilious, opinionated young man with a job in the Foreign Office and an insidious knack of playing on Julie\u2019s insecurities by asking pointedly sceptical, quizzical questions about her work and airily claiming to admire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/26/2\">Powell and Pressburger</a>. His seduction technique involves taking her to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/03/wallace-collection-great-gallery-reopens\">Wallace Collection</a> to see Fragonard\u2019s painting <a href=\"https://www.wallaceprints.org/image/322946/jean-honore-fragonard-the-souvenir\">The Souvenir</a>. It isn\u2019t long before this sinister character has moved in and is buying Julie erotic lingerie, taking her to Venice, disrupting her film-making plans and upending her life.</p> <p>In another movie, this would make for black comedy, and it feels like the plot for something by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/17/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Muriel Spark,</a> or an early <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/01/an-wilson-interview-aftershocks\">AN Wilson</a> novel. But comedy isn\u2019t what\u2019s happening. So what is? Something far subtler and more incremental.</p> <p>Anthony is played with understated arrogance by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/16/expressionist-nihilist-dark-allure-of-tom-burke\">Tom Burke</a>, and newcomer Honor Swinton Byrne gives a graceful and insouciant performance as Julie. She is the daughter of Tilda Swinton, who duly plays Julie\u2019s mother, unobtrusively aged up as a patrician mamma. At first I wondered if there was meta-textual humour in this casting but it is simply that their on-screen rapport is tremendous.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/16/expressionist-nihilist-dark-allure-of-tom-burke\">'I'm an expressionist nihilist at heart': the dark allure of Tom Burke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hogg creates an almost trance-like state with the film, which she shakes off when Anthony and Julie host a dinner party attended by Anthony\u2019s insufferable film-maker friend (a hilarious cameo for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/05/richard-ayoade-it-crowd-gadget-man-double-submarine-author\">Richard Ayoade</a>) who brayingly announces that it is appalling how Britain, the home of the Stones, the Kinks and the Small Faces, still doesn\u2019t do movie musicals.

It is this character who will reveal the poison cloud gathering over the head of poor innocent Julie.</p> <p>The Souvenir is at least partly autobiographical on Hogg\u2019s part, and it sometimes feels as if it is circling around and around a memory that is too painful to be approached directly, of an episode which arguably endangered her development as an artist and in another way stimulated it. But there is something so coolly elegant in this circling \u2013 a choreography of young love, and a talent preparing to take flight.</p>",

The setting is the early 80s, and a sweet-natured young film student called Julie lives in a smart flat in London\u2019s Knightsbridge, just across from the cupola of Harrods department store. This is evidently a pied-\u00e0-terre kept by her extremely well-off parents, who have a country place in north Norfolk. Her mother sometimes pops in after shopping expeditions, and is always having to \u201clend\u201d Julie money for her film projects, yet Julie is charmingly open about her advantages in life. Then the vampiric figure of Anthony makes his appearance. He is a supercilious, opinionated young man with a job in the Foreign Office and an insidious knack of playing on Julie\u2019s insecurities by asking pointedly sceptical, quizzical questions about her work and airily claiming to admire Powell and Pressburger. His seduction technique involves taking her to the Wallace Collection to see Fragonard\u2019s painting The Souvenir. It isn\u2019t long before this sinister character has moved in and is buying Julie erotic lingerie, taking her to Venice, disrupting her film-making plans and upending her life. In another movie, this would make for black comedy, and it feels like the plot for something by Muriel Spark, or an early AN Wilson novel. But comedy isn\u2019t what\u2019s happening. So what is? Something far subtler and more incremental. Anthony is played with understated arrogance by Tom Burke, and newcomer Honor Swinton Byrne gives a graceful and insouciant performance as Julie. She is the daughter of Tilda Swinton, who duly plays Julie\u2019s mother, unobtrusively aged up as a patrician mamma. At first I wondered if there was meta-textual humour in this casting but it is simply that their on-screen rapport is tremendous. Hogg creates an almost trance-like state with the film, which she shakes off when Anthony and Julie host a dinner party attended by Anthony\u2019s insufferable film-maker friend (a hilarious cameo for Richard Ayoade) who brayingly announces that it is appalling how Britain, the home of the Stones, the Kinks and the Small Faces, still doesn\u2019t do movie musicals. (He doesn\u2019t mention the Who, so is maybe not a fan of Tommy.) It is this character who will reveal the poison cloud gathering over the head of poor innocent Julie. The Souvenir is at least partly autobiographical on Hogg\u2019s part, and it sometimes feels as if it is circling around and around a memory that is too painful to be approached directly, of an episode which arguably endangered her development as an artist and in another way stimulated it. But there is something so coolly elegant in this circling \u2013 a choreography of young love, and a talent preparing to take flight.",

      "bodyText": "Somalia faces a new humanitarian crisis with more than 2 million people now threatened by severe hunger, aid agencies say. A further 3 million people are uncertain of their next meal, latest assessments suggest. The new emergency comes two years after the threat of a major disaster in the unstable east African state was averted by timely aid from the international community. Experts describe the crisis as a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d and say communities are still struggling to recover from the lengthy drought that ended in 2017. So far donors have promised less than half of the $1bn (\u00a30.8bn) the UN and other agencies say is required. The average number of people reached with food assistance from January to May this year was only slightly more than half the total over the preceding six months, aid officials say, with many agencies forced to cut back in some areas because the humanitarian appeal for Somalia was so poorly funded. Richard Crothers, Somalia Country Director at the International Rescue Committee, said, \u201cThe international community must scale up its response \u2026 now, or many in Somalia, especially children under five, will die from starvation.\u201d The crisis has been aggravated by continuing conflict between al-Shabaab, the Islamic extremist movement that has been fighting for more than a decade to impose strict religious rule on Somalia, and government troops, which are backed by regional forces and US air assets. Sharifo Ali Mohamud, 30, fled her home town in Middle Shabelle, one of the agricultural regions in Somalia worst hit by the drought, in February. \u201cThe drought hit our village. We used to grow maize in the farm but it became dry. We did not have anything to eat. Then the fighting started,\u201d said Mohamud, who travelled for three days with her seven children to reach Mogadishu, the capital. \u201cLife is very difficult here. We don\u2019t get enough water and food and [if] I return to my village, I am afraid the harsh drought condition will be bitter.\u201d The April to June period, initially forecast as an average rainy season, is now thought to be one of the driest on record in more than 35 years. In recent years, the frequency and duration of these dry spells has increased. The failed rainy season followed abnormally hot and dry conditions since October last year and was partly caused by cyclones in the southern Indian Ocean. Two-thirds of the country\u2019s population live in rural areas and are completely dependent on the rains for their crops and livestock. Nur Ali Ibrahim, a 53-year-old farmer and a father of 11 from the Middle Shabelle region, said he had travelled to a displaced camp in Mogadishu\u2019s Abdiaziz neighbourhood because his family could no longer survive when his farm \u201cwent dry and no crops grew\u201d. The area around Ibrahim\u2019s village, about 40km (25 miles) north of Mogadishu, was controlled by al-Shabaab, making it difficult for humanitarian organisations to deliver aid there. Kenya is urging the UN to list al-Shabaab under the same sanctions as al-Qaida and Islamic State, but foreign donors say the move could stop aid reaching millions. The proposed listing could take effect as soon as Thursday and could mean organisations that have any interaction with the extremists will face serious penalties. \u201cA measure like this will have the effect of criminalising humanitarian aid,\u201d said Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International. \u201cAny measure that would impact the current provision of aid would have extremely serious and substantial implications.\u201d Al-Shabaab is already targeted under broader sanctions imposed by the UN on Somalia, which is heavily aid-dependent after three decades of conflict and economic ruin. Currently UN agencies and humanitarian organisations are exempt from these sanctions, which enables them to deliver urgent aid without prosecution when they venture into territory controlled by al-Shabaab. The Islamist insurgency group, which is affiliated with al-Qaida, has long tried to regulate the distribution of humanitarian aid in the areas it controls, often seeking to levy taxes on NGOs. Ibrahim said food aid did not reach his village because al-Shabaab demanded money from the organisations who wanted to deliver it. \u201cSome of the NGO workers were arrested by al-Shabaab. People told us if you stay here then no food aid will come because of al-Shabaab,\u201d he said. More than half a million displaced people are now estimated to be in Mogadishu, according to Somalia\u2019s National Commission for Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (NCRI). \u201cWe are worried the situation will be much worse if the coordination between the local governments and the aid organisations is not scaled up in the coming few months,\u201d said Nuro Ismail, aid coordination officer at NCRI. Muhubo Aden, 41, left Wanlaweyn, 90km from the capital, when all her livestock died. \u201cAfter all our animals perished, we had nothing to eat and we ran out of money.

Instead of waiting until January to purchase a gym membership that will go unused come March, set good behaviour patterns now, while the weather is better and daylight are hours longer.</p> <p>\u201cBook the time out in your diary, and treat it like a work meeting that can\u2019t be missed,\u201d <a href=\"https://overallfit.co.uk/\" title=\"\">says Sarah Overall, a personal trainer</a>. Although it is tempting to go full throttle, a measured approach is better. \u201cDon\u2019t try to binge on exercise and do five sessions in your first week,\u201d Overall says. \u201cBe sensible. Put in two sessions for your first week back, with a few days break in between.\u201d Aim to build up to four workouts a week.</p> <p>A good way to stay on track is to create accountability for yourself. \u201cRope in family or friends or go to a new class: 90% of forming a habit is about making the effort to actually get there,\u201d Overall says. Find a workout that you enjoy: if you hate going to the gym, take up hiking instead. Give yourself goals. \u201cThink about what you want to achieve, whether it is feeling energised or losing fat,\u201d she recommends.</p> <h2><strong>Food</strong></h2> <p>Even if you haven\u2019t spent the summer months gorging yourself, September is a good time to refocus your eating habits, away from the diet culture messaging that is so pervasive in the new year. \u201cGet stuck into normality \u2013 whatever that is for you,\u201d advises <a href=\"https://www.dietitianuk.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Priya Tew, a dietitian</a> . \u201cFind a good routine for yourself \u2013 so three meals a day that are a balanced mixture of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, proteins and healthy fats.\u201d</p> <p>If you feel you have overindulged on holiday, don\u2019t go on a fad diet. \u201cThey don\u2019t work,\u201d says Tew. \u201cThey just lead to people falling off the wagon and feeling rubbish about themselves. Rather than falling into that trap of yo-yo dieting, make smaller, sustainable changes.\u201d This might mean increasing your fruit and vegetables by one portion a day, or reaching for healthy snacks such as carrots and hummus instead of the biscuit tin.</p> <p>It is a good idea to set aside some time each week to meal plan, and bulk cooking can help a new routine to stick. \u201cThat way, you\u2019re not standing in the kitchen figuring out what to eat,\u201d says Tew. If you are trying to save money from your weekly shop, frozen and tinned food are your friends. \u201cThey can be a lot cheaper and provide you with really good nutrition for your body,\u201d she says. Add in a tin of lentils where you would usually use meat for a healthy and cost-saving measure.</p> <h2><strong>Sleep</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bff7f09a1bacd0ab9a9c728c907c6fa8d653e416\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff7f09a1bacd0ab9a9c728c907c6fa8d653e416/1_0_5330_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018All light can disrupt sleep.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All light can disrupt sleep.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty/GNM design/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whereas the summer often means staying up late or tossing and turning in the sweltering heat, autumn is the ideal time to get sleep back on track. If you are concerned you\u2019re not hitting that magic eight-hour target, remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. \u201cSleep needs are individual,\u201d says Dr Ari Manuel, a sleep and ventilation consultant at Aintree University NHS trust. Most people will need seven to nine hours a night, but each person\u2019s needs vary. If you wake up feeling exhausted or are often tired during the day, you may be sleep deprived.</p> <p>This can be remedied through good sleep hygiene. \u201cIt is about understanding the rhythms of your own sleep and your circadian rhythms,\u201d Manuel says. \u201cWhen you have signals from your body that it is tired, you should respect them and not push through. Recognise that the night is for relaxation, restoration and sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Go to bed at the same time on weekends and weekdays. \u201cWind down from technology before sleep, don\u2019t eat too much heavy food or exercise late at night, and have a cool, dark and quiet bedroom,\u201d Manuel says.

Finally, think about how you can continue moving your career forward \u2013 which often means networking. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean going to complicated networking events,\u201d Everett says. \u201cIt just means keeping in touch with previous colleagues, grabbing cups of coffee with people and talking to people in different departments.\u201d</p> <p>If you are certain you want to move jobs, work out where you add value. \u201cThere is no point in going into the jobs market and telling people what you don\u2019t want to do,\u201d says Everett. \u201cThat is not compelling.

      "bodyText": "Notebooks that smell of fresh paper, purchased in the stationery shop. Uniform laid out neatly on a chair; a rucksack packed, checked and rechecked. No matter how old you get, the memory of the start of the school year never leaves you. The butterfly nerves of a new teacher and classroom; an exhilarating jump that quickly becomes routine. But what if we adults used September as the opportunity for a reset? Because, after the excesses of the summer \u2013 sugary cocktails knocked back by a pool and gut-busting barbecue plates loaded up night after night \u2013 September can be a time for a much-needed refresh. We asked experts for their advice on how to get your year back on track, whatever your age. Exercise New year fitness resolutions are as predictable as the tides: they come and go, but rarely stick. Instead of waiting until January to purchase a gym membership that will go unused come March, set good behaviour patterns now, while the weather is better and daylight are hours longer. \u201cBook the time out in your diary, and treat it like a work meeting that can\u2019t be missed,\u201d says Sarah Overall, a personal trainer. Although it is tempting to go full throttle, a measured approach is better. \u201cDon\u2019t try to binge on exercise and do five sessions in your first week,\u201d Overall says. \u201cBe sensible. Put in two sessions for your first week back, with a few days break in between.\u201d Aim to build up to four workouts a week. A good way to stay on track is to create accountability for yourself. \u201cRope in family or friends or go to a new class: 90% of forming a habit is about making the effort to actually get there,\u201d Overall says. Find a workout that you enjoy: if you hate going to the gym, take up hiking instead. Give yourself goals. \u201cThink about what you want to achieve, whether it is feeling energised or losing fat,\u201d she recommends. Food Even if you haven\u2019t spent the summer months gorging yourself, September is a good time to refocus your eating habits, away from the diet culture messaging that is so pervasive in the new year. \u201cGet stuck into normality \u2013 whatever that is for you,\u201d advises Priya Tew, a dietitian . \u201cFind a good routine for yourself \u2013 so three meals a day that are a balanced mixture of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, proteins and healthy fats.\u201d If you feel you have overindulged on holiday, don\u2019t go on a fad diet. \u201cThey don\u2019t work,\u201d says Tew. \u201cThey just lead to people falling off the wagon and feeling rubbish about themselves. Rather than falling into that trap of yo-yo dieting, make smaller, sustainable changes.\u201d This might mean increasing your fruit and vegetables by one portion a day, or reaching for healthy snacks such as carrots and hummus instead of the biscuit tin. It is a good idea to set aside some time each week to meal plan, and bulk cooking can help a new routine to stick. \u201cThat way, you\u2019re not standing in the kitchen figuring out what to eat,\u201d says Tew. If you are trying to save money from your weekly shop, frozen and tinned food are your friends. \u201cThey can be a lot cheaper and provide you with really good nutrition for your body,\u201d she says. Add in a tin of lentils where you would usually use meat for a healthy and cost-saving measure. Sleep Whereas the summer often means staying up late or tossing and turning in the sweltering heat, autumn is the ideal time to get sleep back on track. If you are concerned you\u2019re not hitting that magic eight-hour target, remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. \u201cSleep needs are individual,\u201d says Dr Ari Manuel, a sleep and ventilation consultant at Aintree University NHS trust. Most people will need seven to nine hours a night, but each person\u2019s needs vary. If you wake up feeling exhausted or are often tired during the day, you may be sleep deprived. This can be remedied through good sleep hygiene. \u201cIt is about understanding the rhythms of your own sleep and your circadian rhythms,\u201d Manuel says. \u201cWhen you have signals from your body that it is tired, you should respect them and not push through. Recognise that the night is for relaxation, restoration and sleep.\u201d Go to bed at the same time on weekends and weekdays. \u201cWind down from technology before sleep, don\u2019t eat too much heavy food or exercise late at night, and have a cool, dark and quiet bedroom,\u201d Manuel says. Your bedroom should be a place for rest and sex and nothing else. Make sure to disconnect from the outside world in the hour before bed. \u201cIt is about accepting that this is a time for you to relax and go to sleep \u2013 this is your time and no one else\u2019s.\u201d Which means no aimless social media scrolling in bed. There is growing concern about the impact of blue light from screens before bedtime, but Manuel says this misses the point: all light, even from the streetlight outside your window, can disrupt sleep. It might help to invest in a blackout blind or an eye mask. Money If you\u2019re feeling the pinch after the summer break, now is a good time to think about your financial health, says Jason Butler, a personal finance expert and author of Money Moments: Simple Steps to Financial Well-being. Consider your spending. \u201cOne of the reasons people don\u2019t get ahead financially is because they\u2019ve never really addressed their relationship with money,\u201d says Butler.

It may seem tedious, but when you think about the potential savings, it is well worth it. \u201cYou might save yourself \u00a3500 a year \u2013 how many people earn that much in half a day?\u201d Say no to expensive social events that aren\u2019t important to you. Turn off one-step purchasing online to curb impulse buys. \u201cIt\u2019s not about becoming a monk and locking yourself away,\u201d Butler says, \u201cbut you need to be clear about what you can afford.\u201d If you are in a position to save, make sure you are getting the best return on your investments. If you are on universal credit or working tax credit, a Help to Save account will match every \u00a31 you save (up to \u00a350 a month) with 50p over four years.

      "body": "<p>While thousands of fires roar and crackle through the Amazon rainforest, Brazil faces a quieter tragedy playing out in farm country: the silence of empty hives. Earlier this year, beekeepers reported losing over 500m honeybees in only three months. The speed and scale of the die-offs recall colony collapse disorder, a malady that began decimating bees across North America and Europe in 2006. But the symptoms are tellingly different. Where colony collapse caused worker bees to abandon their hives and disappear, the bees in Brazil are dropping dead on the spot. And where scientists blamed colony collapse on a combination of factors, the evidence in Brazil points to one overarching cause: pesticides.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2019/aug/29/us-greta-thunberg-climate\">Welcome to the US, Greta. With your help we can save the planet and ourselves | Rebecca Solnit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The parallels between Brazil\u2019s Amazon crisis and its bee die-offs are many. Just as the relaxation of forestry rules has led to more fires, so have loosened pesticide restrictions exposed more bees to lethal doses. Nearly 300 new products have been fast-tracked for approval since the beginning of the year, including known bee-killers banned or strictly regulated in other countries. And just as burning a rainforest impacts a lot more than trees, so does the loss of bees stretch far past the walls of the hive.</p> <p>Depending on how you parse the numbers, bee-pollinated crops account for as much as a third of the food in the human diet. Yields of everything from canola to soybeans drop in their absence, while fruits and nuts like blueberries and almonds depend upon them entirely. Beyond agriculture, scientists can only guess at the scale of the problem, but the situation begs a troubling question. If colonies nurtured and tended by professional beekeepers are dying, then what is the fate of bees in the wild?</p> <p>When we think of bees, or minds turn immediately to the one species we know best \u2013 the domestic honeybee. Their hives have been a buzzing part of our farms for at least 4,000 years, longer than such familiar crops as apples, oats, peas, and coffee. But honeybees are just the tip of the iceberg. Our landscapes abound with wild bees too \u2013 diggers, miners, masons, wool-carders, leafcutters, bumblebees, and more. Estimates put the total number of bee species above 20,000, more than all the world\u2019s birds and mammals combined. Many of them are also essential pollinators, of crops as well as the native plants at the heart of ecosystems from tropical forests to mountain meadows. And while most wild bees have never been studied in detail, we know they\u2019re vulnerable to the same chemical threats as honeybees. So whenever domestic hives start failing, it signals a much broader problem in nature.</p> <p>The challenges facing Brazil\u2019s bees, as well as its forests, boil down in part to bad policy. But that doesn\u2019t let anyone off the hook, because in a democracy government policy amounts to an expression of collective will. And Brazil is hardly the only democratic country where environmental protections are wavering.

      "bodyText": "While thousands of fires roar and crackle through the Amazon rainforest, Brazil faces a quieter tragedy playing out in farm country: the silence of empty hives. Earlier this year, beekeepers reported losing over 500m honeybees in only three months. The speed and scale of the die-offs recall colony collapse disorder, a malady that began decimating bees across North America and Europe in 2006. But the symptoms are tellingly different. Where colony collapse caused worker bees to abandon their hives and disappear, the bees in Brazil are dropping dead on the spot. And where scientists blamed colony collapse on a combination of factors, the evidence in Brazil points to one overarching cause: pesticides. The parallels between Brazil\u2019s Amazon crisis and its bee die-offs are many. Just as the relaxation of forestry rules has led to more fires, so have loosened pesticide restrictions exposed more bees to lethal doses. Nearly 300 new products have been fast-tracked for approval since the beginning of the year, including known bee-killers banned or strictly regulated in other countries. And just as burning a rainforest impacts a lot more than trees, so does the loss of bees stretch far past the walls of the hive. Depending on how you parse the numbers, bee-pollinated crops account for as much as a third of the food in the human diet. Yields of everything from canola to soybeans drop in their absence, while fruits and nuts like blueberries and almonds depend upon them entirely. Beyond agriculture, scientists can only guess at the scale of the problem, but the situation begs a troubling question. If colonies nurtured and tended by professional beekeepers are dying, then what is the fate of bees in the wild? When we think of bees, or minds turn immediately to the one species we know best \u2013 the domestic honeybee. Their hives have been a buzzing part of our farms for at least 4,000 years, longer than such familiar crops as apples, oats, peas, and coffee. But honeybees are just the tip of the iceberg. Our landscapes abound with wild bees too \u2013 diggers, miners, masons, wool-carders, leafcutters, bumblebees, and more. Estimates put the total number of bee species above 20,000, more than all the world\u2019s birds and mammals combined. Many of them are also essential pollinators, of crops as well as the native plants at the heart of ecosystems from tropical forests to mountain meadows. And while most wild bees have never been studied in detail, we know they\u2019re vulnerable to the same chemical threats as honeybees. So whenever domestic hives start failing, it signals a much broader problem in nature. The challenges facing Brazil\u2019s bees, as well as its forests, boil down in part to bad policy. But that doesn\u2019t let anyone off the hook, because in a democracy government policy amounts to an expression of collective will. And Brazil is hardly the only democratic country where environmental protections are wavering. Recent moves in the United States have shrunk wilderness areas and weakened the Endangered Species Act, not to mention promoting the use of pesticides in National Wildlife Refuges and re-approving sulfoxaflor, a product banned in 2015 specifically for its toxicity to bees. Yes, we should demand better from our leaders, but we should also demand better from ourselves \u2013 at the ballot box and beyond. Buried in recent news coverage on Brazil is a remarkable uptick in the demand for organic foods, reflecting a global trend expected to double sales and production in less than five years. It\u2019s a reminder that how we buy food directly impacts the way that we grow it, and organic methods \u2013 even if interspersed with conventional fields \u2013 support a far greater diversity of pollinators.

The rough, reality-based illustrations of her body move through the memoir\u2019s pages both as a person enduring the banal, and as a sexualized figure, recovering from trauma. Spanning a single day with extended departures into reflection and digression, the memoir chronicles both the journey of a daily commute, and a larger one from blackout sexual encounters to sobriety and motherhood. That means a fair amount of difficult, sometimes shame-filled, material: \u201cAll the mornings I woke up and couldn\u2019t remember whether I\u2019d had sex the night before, I\u2019d finger myself to see if I was sore,\u201d writes Williams beneath a drawing of her with a hand beneath her scrunched-up shorts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/aug/27/pictures-unite-graphic-design-vision-marie-otto-neurath\">Before emojis: the utopian graphic language of Marie and Otto Neurath</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Throughout, she considers how her body is used both privately and publicly, a question which is particularly interesting in a form where the artist is representing herself again and again. She builds an equation where desirability equals visibility, and wrestles with whether, if there are only two options on offer, she\u2019d prefer to be objectified or ignored.</p> <p>Until 1989, \u201cthe Comics Code\u201d forbade depictions of \u201cillicit sex relations\u201d in mainstream comics (meaning a graphic novel or comic book sold by a publisher with distribution), and out of this restriction, comics grew into a space of underground liberation. Artists began working without any worry over commercial viability, because there was none. This was the spirit from which Aline Kominsky-Crumb began drawing bodies extravagant in their ugliness, Phoebe Gloeckner released comics filled with hyperrealistic drawings of teenage sexual violence, and Alison Bechdel started her long-running serial comic Dykes to Watch Out For.</p> <p>The sensation of shame extends far beyond sexual behavior and bodies, but from our earliest stories \u2013 Eve eats the apple and grasps for anything nearby to cover herself with \u2013 shame, especially women\u2019s shame, is so often associated with physicality or desire. A body is the space no one can escape, and so it\u2019s the place from which we project ourselves onto the world, and receive its scrutiny. \u201cThe visual register itself is often seen as \u2018excessive\u2019,\u201d writes Hillary Chute in Graphic Women: Life Narrative and Contemporary Comics, referring to the way that memoirs of women are sometimes eyed with suspicion.</p> <p>Female shame is often interlocked with trauma, sex and exposure. As Williams writes in Commute, \u201cshame is an instrument of oppression\u201d, and across comics, female artists are confronting their mottled self-images through the act of drawing their bodies, traumas and desires.</p> <p>\u201cShame has been such a big part of women\u2019s work and comics in general,\u201d says Chute. \u201c[Because] comics is a form about intimacy. It\u2019s about making visible a person\u2019s interior.\u201d</p> <p>Illustration offers the opportunity not only to depict the reality of a physical body, but also presents an opportunity to represent how one sees oneself. \u201c[Comics] are being drawn and written from an embodied perspective,\u201d says Chute. Through the use of caricature and sometimes grotesquely-exaggerated forms, visual arguments about women\u2019s bodies can operate quite differently than they do in live-action television, film or even prose novels. TV is constrained, at least to some extent, by the limitations of real bodies, particularly those that are visually appealing. In prose, it may be arduous and distracting to describe the way an arm jiggles and dimples form across the stomach each time our protagonist leans forward or bends over, but in comics, we\u2019re reminded of the body every time it\u2019s drawn \u2013 which is often every panel or page.</p> <p>Gina Wynbrandt\u2019s Will Someone Please Have Sex With Me, for example, chronicles a young woman\u2019s loneliness and unfulfilled sexual desires in cringe-worthy detail and neon linework. Her facial expressions are consistently exaggerated \u2014 her tongue lolling out of her mouth, her body splayed out in bulbous exaggeration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2b83db3379152e6566f915d50db2c2c687c3ff19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b83db3379152e6566f915d50db2c2c687c3ff19/0_0_2100_978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from Kristen Radtke\u2019s Terrible Men.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"466\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image from Kristen Radtke\u2019s Terrible Men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pantheon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An extreme example of physical caricature can be found in Allie Brosh\u2019s popular Hyperbole and a Half, both a book and webcomic. Brosh\u2019s subject is often her anxiety and depression, and the body she draws to represent herself isn\u2019t a body at all, at least in any realistically representational sense: it\u2019s a noodle-shaped blob with sticks for arms and legs, with a yellow cone to represent her ponytail atop a frog-like face. \u201cThis character sort of evolved and doesn\u2019t look like me, but in a way it\u2019s an impression of me,\u201d Brosh said in a 2013 interview on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2013/10/29/240779810/hyperbole-creator-considers-all-the-things\">NPR</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s this absurd, crude little thing, and that\u2019s really what I am inside, and it\u2019s a more accurate way to represent myself.\u201d</p> <p>There isn\u2019t something inherently radical about drawing oneself, but to render the female body at all risks opening an artist up to scrutiny. When my first book, a graphic memoir, came out, I was surprised by reviews that called attention to the way I looked. \u201cThe abundance of self-portraits makes her author photo on the back flap oddly unsettling,\u201d wrote one review, \u201cBecause it both clearly resembles yet subtly contradicts the character in her artwork.\u201d I\u2019d drawn myself both as too real, and not real enough.</p> <p>Soon I started questioning my own body every time I sat down to draw. Should I cut out that fat roll or should I accentuate it? Do I smooth out my hair? I often take reference photos of myself before I draw difficult poses. In one, my nipples showed through my tank top slightly. Should I draw them, then, I wondered? What will it mean if I have nipples? What will it mean if I <em>don\u2019t</em> have nipples?</p> <p>In 2017, writer and illustrator Mira Jacob was working on her own graphic memoir, Good Talk: A Memoir in Conversations. \u201cHi, do you have a sec for naked drawing talk? I need to know if what I did looks chicken,\u201d she texted one afternoon. She showed me a drawing she\u2019d made of her naked, early-20s self. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to get slammed?\u201d She asked. Jacob hadn\u2019t drawn herself naked before \u2013 at least not for public consumption \u2013 and she had some anxiety about representing herself in her early-adulthood physical prime. The illustration was not meant to represent shame. It accompanied a section depicting a young woman engaged in enjoyable, consensual sexual relationships, yet the drawing itself opened up an insecurity off the page well beyond the narrative\u2019s intention. Like other women, she\u2019d spent her entire life being silently and not-so-silently judged for her appearance, but the drawing introduced an added nervousness about how the way in which she drew her body would cause a reader to criticize or dismiss her. The question of whether or not the drawing was \u201cchicken\u201d, or too timid, also illuminates another layer of the problem: There\u2019s a way to draw a naked body that\u2019s actually <em>not graphic enough.</em></p> <p>Jacob came up with a temporary solution: When she drew her naked body, she exaggerated her pubic hair. \u201cJust add more bush,\u201d we began saying to each other when a drawing needed \u201cuglying up\u201d. Jacob\u2019s struggle to represent her body on the page seems largely in line with the daily questions Williams is asking in Commute \u2013 to hide one\u2019s body is also to protect it from a form of scrutiny. \u201cHaters may not be scared of much,\u201d Jacob said to me, \u201cbut bush is probably a good place to start.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ae3410d37146fe67b431e6920fc962e7f069517\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ae3410d37146fe67b431e6920fc962e7f069517/0_0_4800_6738/712.jpg\" alt=\"Trinidad Escobar - All These Years. image taken from Drawing Power: Women\u2019s Stories of Sexual Violence, Harassment, and Survival\" width=\"712\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trinidad Escobar - All These Years. image taken from Drawing Power: Women\u2019s Stories of Sexual Violence, Harassment, and Survival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Abrams ComicArts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Drawing a female body isn\u2019t necessarily about confronting shame, but in many ways it can be about reminding oneself that it\u2019s difficult to be in a body at all. In an early scene in Thi Bui\u2019s The Best We Could Do, the narrator is half-naked, in labor, on a hospital bed. As she consents to an epidural, the needle injected into her spine is supersized, exaggerated so it appears nearly as large as she is.</p> <p>Critic Tahneer Oksman calls this quality a \u201cpre-linguistic sense of the body.\u201d Through the act of drawing comics, an artist is translating an internal feeling into an external, physical representation, which Oksman says mirrors the way shame is experienced. \u201cYou feel shame before you have a language for it \u2026 [Comics can communicate] the excess of the body and its discomfort without putting it into language.\u201d</p> <p>The new anthology Drawing Power: Women\u2019s Stories of Sexual Violence, Harassment, and Survival offers the work of over sixty artists confronting this discomfort head on. \u201cA lot of guys would look at my comics and then recoil,\u201d legendary feminist artist Roberta Gregory writes in Adult Comics, referring to Naughty Bits, the comic book series she wrote through the nineties until its final issue in 2004. Gregory suggests quite clearly that this work was not made for the men who were repelled by it. Jennifer Camper\u2019s Noncompliant offers a similar message. \u201cI rarely make autobiographical comics,\u201d she writes. Camper has made prolific, important work about sexual assault, but she\u2019s stopped short of representing herself. \u201cIn my comics I get the final word,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>The toughest thing about shame, says Oksman, is that \u201cit\u2019s a form of self-isolation\u201d, in which women are taught to keep these feelings private in order to avoid the additional shame that comes of sharing it. If shame is indeed an act of oppression, then drawing experiences from everyday humiliations to deep-seated sexual traumas can be considered an exercise in liberation.</p>",

Jacob came up with a temporary solution: When she drew her naked body, she exaggerated her pubic hair. \u201cJust add more bush,\u201d we began saying to each other when a drawing needed \u201cuglying up\u201d. Jacob\u2019s struggle to represent her body on the page seems largely in line with the daily questions Williams is asking in Commute \u2013 to hide one\u2019s body is also to protect it from a form of scrutiny. \u201cHaters may not be scared of much,\u201d Jacob said to me, \u201cbut bush is probably a good place to start.\u201d Drawing a female body isn\u2019t necessarily about confronting shame, but in many ways it can be about reminding oneself that it\u2019s difficult to be in a body at all. In an early scene in Thi Bui\u2019s The Best We Could Do, the narrator is half-naked, in labor, on a hospital bed. As she consents to an epidural, the needle injected into her spine is supersized, exaggerated so it appears nearly as large as she is. Critic Tahneer Oksman calls this quality a \u201cpre-linguistic sense of the body.\u201d Through the act of drawing comics, an artist is translating an internal feeling into an external, physical representation, which Oksman says mirrors the way shame is experienced. \u201cYou feel shame before you have a language for it \u2026 [Comics can communicate] the excess of the body and its discomfort without putting it into language.\u201d The new anthology Drawing Power: Women\u2019s Stories of Sexual Violence, Harassment, and Survival offers the work of over sixty artists confronting this discomfort head on. \u201cA lot of guys would look at my comics and then recoil,\u201d legendary feminist artist Roberta Gregory writes in Adult Comics, referring to Naughty Bits, the comic book series she wrote through the nineties until its final issue in 2004. Gregory suggests quite clearly that this work was not made for the men who were repelled by it. Jennifer Camper\u2019s Noncompliant offers a similar message. \u201cI rarely make autobiographical comics,\u201d she writes. Camper has made prolific, important work about sexual assault, but she\u2019s stopped short of representing herself. \u201cIn my comics I get the final word,\u201d she writes. The toughest thing about shame, says Oksman, is that \u201cit\u2019s a form of self-isolation\u201d, in which women are taught to keep these feelings private in order to avoid the additional shame that comes of sharing it. If shame is indeed an act of oppression, then drawing experiences from everyday humiliations to deep-seated sexual traumas can be considered an exercise in liberation.",

      "bodyText": "Efforts to get compensation for the US opioid crisis with two multimillion-dollar drug manufacturer payouts have been met by leading activists and addiction experts with a range of responses from incredulity to cautious optimism. On Tuesday, the wealthy Sackler family and their embattled drugmaker, Purdue Pharma, makers of two opioids that triggered the crisis, Oxycontin and MSContin, reportedly backed a proposal to resolve all opioid lawsuits against themselves and the company for more than $11bn. The potential settlement, if agreed by attorneys general across the US, would be the largest to date in the complex litigation over addictive painkillers, which have caused the deaths of about 400,000 people since 1999. The proposal, first reported by NBC, came a day after a judge in a different case in Oklahoma found that drug firm Johnson &amp; Johnson created a \u201ctemporary\u201d public nuisance by tricking doctors into overprescribing its opioid-based medications. Judge Thad Balkman ordered the company to pay $572m to Oklahoma as reimbursement for costs it incurred dealing with the surge in addiction and overdoses. Shares in the company rose more than 5.4%, reflecting investors relief that the payout was far less than the $17.5bn the state sought and likely to bring down the liabilities facing drug companies and distributors that by some estimates could reach $100bn. But the two potential payouts \u2013 one a pre-trial settlement and the other a court judgment \u2013 have brought widely different reactions. Nan Goldin, the photographer whose Pain campaign has triggered widespread protests at Sackler-supported art institutions and forced the family to abandon philanthropic donations, told the Guardian the reported Purdue settlement would be \u201chighly questionable\u201d and that the Sacklers would still walk away as billionaires and experience no judicial judgment. \u201cThe whole thing is orchestrated by the Sacklers and very well done, but underneath it\u2019s highly questionable. We want them to be held personally accountable, and that\u2019s not going to be possible with this settlement. They\u2019re not putting their own money and threatening to go bankrupt. I think it\u2019s blackmail,\u201d she said. Under the proposal, Purdue will file for bankruptcy, hand itself over to a trust controlled by the states, cities, and counties in the lawsuits, and sell its overseas drugmaker Mundipharma. But the settlement only requires the Sacklers to hand over $3bn in cash. When last valued by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the family was worth $13bn. The deal contains no provision for addiction treatment centers, pain-abatement alternatives, and the anti-addiction drugs that Purdue is offering are often not covered by insurance plans, although many addicts might not have insurance. \u201cThis is great PR for the Sacklers \u2013 almost like their philanthropy \u2013 but they are not taking responsibility and they are remaining outside the law,\u201d Goldin said. Opponents of the deal argue that at least half of the sum is in the form of free drugs, including Oxycontin and its branded buprenophine Butrans, which Purdue manufactures at cost but will value at retail prices, so essentially profiting from the arrangement to distribute. The proposed Purdue settlement could result in only small amounts of money reaching individual cities and municipalities affected by opioid addiction and depends on a critical mass of state attorneys general accepting it. However, the Johnson &amp; Johnson court judgment in Oklahoma can potentially be duplicated from state to state. It also reflects that the addiction epidemic was caused by a change in medical practice \u2013 that is, the over-prescription of opioid painkillers driven by deceptive marketing campaigns disguised as education. \u201cThis is a landmark decision,\u201d said Andrew Kolodny, a doctor and opioid researcher who was a key witness for Oklahoma in the case. \u201cIt would be nice of there was more money, but $572m will go a long way in helping Oklahoma address the crisis.\u201d The Oklahoma case, Kolodny says, recognized that the over-prescription of opioids contributed to a massive loss of life.

      "bodyText": "Human rights campaigners have threatened the Home Office with legal action over its appointment of Lord Carlile as the independent reviewer of its anti-radicalisation programme Prevent. The peer\u2019s appointment, announced this month, was met with criticism from human rights and civil liberties groups, citing his previous on-record support for the Prevent programme. Carlile has admitted to parliament that he \u201cmay be somewhat biased towards\u201d Prevent and declared his \u201cconsidered and strong support\u201d for the programme. However, in an interview with BBC Newsnight, the peer sought to reassure critics, claiming that \u201ceverything is up for discussion, including scrapping\u201d the programme. The review was announced following years of mounting criticism of Prevent, which has become a toxic brand for many within Muslim communities, with some viewing it as a state tool for spying on them. The human rights charity Rights Watch (UK) has taken the first step in legal action against the government to challenge Carlile\u2019s appointment. The group \u2013 which works to ensure measures taken by the UK government in pursuit of national security are compliant with human rights and international law \u2013 alleges that, in leading the review, Carlile cannot be independent. The peer oversaw the government\u2019s first review of Prevent in 2011 and has previously been a member of the Prevent oversight board.

It\u2019s lively and cool but unpretentious; it\u2019s free to get in; there\u2019s often a band that you can listen to with your inventive margarita; and people seem to come determined to have a good time in a particular make-your-own-fun Melbourne way. It\u2019s good for friends, solo adventurers and families of some ages (it\u2019s hard to get around with a pram, and toddlers may need carrying).<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://thenightmarket.com.au/\" title=\"\">thenightmarket.com.au</a><br></em><strong>Bridget</strong></p> \n<h2>Pike Place Market, Seattle, US</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b00b7db6b4c287ee1d69f123de053fa0b013369b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b00b7db6b4c287ee1d69f123de053fa0b013369b/0_0_5594_3729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seattle\u2019s Pike Place Market, with its familiar neon-lit clock and brass pig\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Pike Place is the source of the area\u2019s fresh fruit, fish and flowers. All of this produce is put to good use as Pike\u2019s is home to several independent coffee shops and restaurants that overlook the Pugent Sound. If there is a more perfect way to spend the evening than drinking a craft beer and watching the sunset over Bainbridge Island, I am yet to find it. If you are a fan of grunge music, Pike Place is massively important as it\u2019s opposite the legendary Showbox venue and was also one of the locations in the cult film Singles. Ironically for such an independent venue, it is also the birthplace of one of the world\u2019s biggest brands \u2013 Starbucks first ever store is there.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://pikeplacemarket.org/\" title=\"\">pikeplacemarket.org</a></em><br><strong>Jennifer</strong></p> \n<h2>Turkish market, Berlin</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e629cb12b1d416107b1fcf918e5d35843fe9f2ab\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e629cb12b1d416107b1fcf918e5d35843fe9f2ab/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hat stall at the Turkish market in Berlin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Berlin\u2019s most charming flea market takes place next to the stunning Landwehrkanal every other Sunday.

If you\u2019ve ever wondered where Berliners pick up their unique clothes, answers can be found here. You can quickly assemble a new clubbing outfit from one of the many stalls where hungover Neuk\u00f6llners are passing on half their wardrobe. There is also plenty of East German kitsch, straight from the attic, beautiful kids\u2019 clothes and toys, and food from Japanese, French and Turkish stalls, which you can eat on the banks of the canal.

The colour and variety of the produce blew my mind. When you realise that this market was threatened with extinction and was saved by a group of merchants, it becomes even more impressive. Fighting the invasion of junk food and big box stores, they formed a non-profit group and eventually were rewarded by the Canarian Government and the Santa Cruz City Hall for restoring the market as a hub for the community.<br>\u2022 <em>On <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AmigosdelaRecova/\" title=\"\">Facebook</a><br></em><strong>Kate Holbrook</strong></p> \n<h2>El Mercado Central de Atarazanas, M\u00e1laga, Spain</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8071fa8187fef0e7381f130a46a52e53b9ddb2b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8071fa8187fef0e7381f130a46a52e53b9ddb2b/0_0_6472_5288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists and locals entering and leaving the Mercado Central de Atarazanas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"817\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>El Mercado Central de Atarazanas is the indoor food market in the centre of M\u00e1laga, selling fresh local produce.

It\u2019s lively and cool but unpretentious; it\u2019s free to get in; there\u2019s often a band that you can listen to with your inventive margarita; and people seem to come determined to have a good time in a particular make-your-own-fun Melbourne way. It\u2019s good for friends, solo adventurers and families of some ages (it\u2019s hard to get around with a pram, and toddlers may need carrying). \u2022 thenightmarket.com.au Bridget Pike Place Market, Seattle, US Pike Place is the source of the area\u2019s fresh fruit, fish and flowers. All of this produce is put to good use as Pike\u2019s is home to several independent coffee shops and restaurants that overlook the Pugent Sound. If there is a more perfect way to spend the evening than drinking a craft beer and watching the sunset over Bainbridge Island, I am yet to find it. If you are a fan of grunge music, Pike Place is massively important as it\u2019s opposite the legendary Showbox venue and was also one of the locations in the cult film Singles. Ironically for such an independent venue, it is also the birthplace of one of the world\u2019s biggest brands \u2013 Starbucks first ever store is there. \u2022 pikeplacemarket.org Jennifer Turkish market, Berlin Berlin\u2019s most charming flea market takes place next to the stunning Landwehrkanal every other Sunday. While tourists head to Mauerpark, this is where, to me, the real fun (and bargains) can be found. If you\u2019ve ever wondered where Berliners pick up their unique clothes, answers can be found here. You can quickly assemble a new clubbing outfit from one of the many stalls where hungover Neuk\u00f6llners are passing on half their wardrobe. There is also plenty of East German kitsch, straight from the attic, beautiful kids\u2019 clothes and toys, and food from Japanese, French and Turkish stalls, which you can eat on the banks of the canal. Go late, like a local, coffee in hand. \u2022 tuerkenmarkt.de Katie Mercado de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de \u00c1frica, Tenerife The beautiful market building with its statues and flowers was gorgeous, but more astounding were the displays of seafood, fruit and vegetables. The colour and variety of the produce blew my mind. When you realise that this market was threatened with extinction and was saved by a group of merchants, it becomes even more impressive. Fighting the invasion of junk food and big box stores, they formed a non-profit group and eventually were rewarded by the Canarian Government and the Santa Cruz City Hall for restoring the market as a hub for the community. \u2022 On Facebook Kate Holbrook El Mercado Central de Atarazanas, M\u00e1laga, Spain El Mercado Central de Atarazanas is the indoor food market in the centre of M\u00e1laga, selling fresh local produce. The building is impressive, with a huge stained-glass window at one end, but of equal artistic merit are the displays of seasonal fruit and veg. We watched the fishmongers at work on the latest catch and were tempted by the charcuter\u00eda and olive stalls. There are a couple of bars inside, opening out on to the street but we retired to an old sherry bar, only a five-minute walk away, to toast our purchases. \u2022 malagaturismo.com Moira Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Business Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to bypass parliament in order to ensure Brexit goes ahead meant another battering for the pound, which fell more than a cent against the US dollar to below $1.218. It dipped against the euro by a similar amount but it has recovered some ground overnight to sit at $1.22 and \u20ac1.101. Brexit is also a factor in declining car production, which has sunk to its lowest level since 2001, not helped either by weak demand from key overseas markets. The FTSE100 looks set to dip 0.4% this morning, following losses on Asian markets overnight. The papers These being days of historic infamy, we have a longer wrap-up of the UK papers and some of the foreign press reaction too. A summary follows. There is plenty of constitutional outcry, and not much else, on the front pages of the papers today. The Guardian\u2019s lead is: \u201cOutrage as Johnson suspends parliament\u201d, while the i has \u201cMPs outraged as Johnson shuts down parliament\u201d. The Mail is thrilled: \u201cBoris takes the gloves off\u201d, as are the Times: \u201cJohnson goes for broke\u201d, the Express: \u201cBrexit: the die is cast\u201d and the Telegraph, which employs Johnson \u2013 it features a quote as its headline: \u201cThe prime minister must give effect to the will of the nation\u201d. The FT says there has been \u201cUproar as Johnson shuts down parliament to protect Brexit plan\u201d, the Sun leavens things with the hilarious headline: \u201cHey big suspender\u201d and the furious Mirror labels the PM: \u201cProrogue\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A public inquiry into allegations of wrongdoing at casinos run by Crown Resorts will decide whether the James Packer-dominated group is fit to hold a licence in New South Wales and whether the state\u2019s gambling laws need to be overhauled. Terms of reference, released by the NSW Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority on Thursday, show the inquiry, to be headed by former judge Patricia Bergin, will also investigate whether Packer\u2019s decision to sell almost 20% of Crown to Hong Kong billionaire Lawrence Ho breached the gambling group\u2019s licence to build a high-roller casino at Barangaroo in Sydney. If she finds Crown or its NSW subsidiary is not fit to hold the Barangaroo licence, she is to decide \u201cwhat, if any, changes would be required to render those persons suitable\u201d. At stake for Crown is the $1bn Barangaroo casino, currently under construction near the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which Packer proposed back in 2012 as part of a bid to lure international VIP gamblers to Australia. But Crown\u2019s rival Star, which runs Sydney\u2019s existing casino, will be watching the inquiry closely because Bergin has also been asked to report on whether NSW\u2019s licensing laws are fit for purpose \u201cin an environment of growing complexity of both extant and emerging risks for gaming and casinos\u201d. Packer has already sold about 10% of Crown to Ho but ahead of the release of the terms of reference of the inquiry the two billionaires announced the transfer of the remaining stake was on ice awaiting the outcome of the NSW inquiry and approval from state authorities in Victoria and Western Australia. Bergin has been asked to look into allegations published by Nine newspapers and on the media company\u2019s TV current affairs show 60 Minutes that Crown or its \u201cagents, affiliates or subsidiaries engaged in money laundering; breached gambling laws; and partnered with junket operators with links to drug traffickers, money launderers, human traffickers and organised crime groups\u201d. She has also been asked to decide whether Ho or other key players who are to become associates of Crown as a result of the sale \u201chave any business association with any person, body or association who is not of good repute, having regard to character, honesty, integrity, or has undesirable or unsatisfactory financial sources\u201d. A provision in the Barangaroo licence bans Lawrence Ho\u2019s father Stanley Ho, along with some other members of the Ho family and a number of companies associated with them, from being involved with Barangaroo. Stanley Ho has been accused of links with triad organised crime gangs but has always denied the allegation. The ban list was secret until 8 August, when it was tabled in NSW parliament following a request from independent upper house MP Justin Field. It revealed that Lawrence Ho was a director of a company banned from involvement in Barangaroo at the time he agreed to buy 20% of Crown from Packer. The document also raised questions about Melco\u2019s suitability to be involved in the project because of the presence in the group\u2019s corporate structure of another banned entity, Great Respect. Within hours of the document being tabled, the NSW government announced the Bergin investigation, which has most of the powers of a royal commission. Crown said it was examining the terms of reference and would cooperate with the inquiry. Earlier, Ho and Packer put their $1.75bn share deal on hold until regulators in three Australian states approve the deal. In May, Ho\u2019s Melco Resorts group agreed to pay Packer\u2019s private company, Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH), $1.75bn for almost 20% of Crown. The deal was to be completed in two tranches. The first half of the shares changed hands in early June and the other half was due to go across on 30 September. At the time the deal was unveiled, Melco said it \u201cdoes not require regulatory approval to be consummated\u201d. However, an updated sale agreement, filed with the Australian stock exchange on Thursday morning, now contains a condition requiring a letter from authorities in New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria stating Melco \u201cis a suitable person to be associated with the management of a casino, each such notification being unconditional, or on conditions acceptable to the buyer acting reasonably\u201d. Since the sale was announced Crown has been rocked by allegations of links to money-laundering operations, organised crime influence and special treatment at the border for high-roller gamblers. Meanwhile, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, which oversees Crown\u2019s flagship Melbourne casino, has told the state government it needs more time to reexamine the allegations raised in media reports. \u201cThe matters are complex and therefore require additional time to thoroughly review,\u201d Victoria\u2019s consumer affairs minister, Marlene Kairouz, said. In a statement, CPH said although it \u201cdoes not consider there has been any breach of agreement, licence condition or legislation in connection with the subject matter of the transactions with Melco, it has taken this step in agreement with Melco so the regulatory processes and Ilga [Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority] inquiry can proceed in an appropriate manner\u201d. Melco told the US Nasdaq exchange, where it is listed, that it and \u201cCPH have agreed to allow more time for the relevant Australian regulatory processes to be completed before completing the acquisition of the remaining 67,675,000 shares of Crown\u201d. Melco said the closing date had been extended to 60 business days \u201cfollowing the completion of the relevant Australian regulatory processes\u201d. The company said there was a \u201csunset date\u201d of 31 May next year after which either side could walk away from the transaction. Either side could extend the sunset date by six months, it said.",

As I walked across it, I could see all of the bathers lying beneath me on the sand. I had a perfect bird\u2019s eye view. I had never seen the beach from that angle, and it was fascinating. That evening, I began the research <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/nov/21/sleeping-sunbathers-in-lithuania-in-pictures\">for this series, Comfort Zone</a>. I looked through reams of beach photography, but pretty much none of the images had captured the scene from above. I found nothing documenting it from this angle in this clean, simple, almost clinical way.</p> <p>I wanted to create a typology of beach culture \u2013 a kind of study of the phenomenon as if I were investigating a different species. I was thinking about what it would be like to come to Earth as an alien and witness this: what sense would you make of it?</p> <p>As well as my camera, I used equipment to help me to shoot from above while I was moving around at beach level: a four-metre-long pole with an attachment for my camera, and a radio trigger for when I was ready to shoot.</p> <p>It was important that the photos were perfectly candid, so I didn\u2019t tell anyone I was shooting them. But people were looking at me. I realised that the people who weren\u2019t looking at me must be sleeping, so I knew which ones I wanted to photograph.</p> <p>I tried to avoid any conversations or arouse suspicion. I wasn\u2019t doing anything against the law, but the beach is a place where people sometimes don\u2019t feel comfortable being shot. Some people did approach me though \u2013 you can imagine seeing the same person every day walking with this strange thing on his shoulders, so they asked me what I was doing. I said I was just taking photos of nature, and if they were persistent with their questions, I would show them images I had taken of the sea or the forest.</p> <p>When those images started to be published, there were some concerns, and people questioned my practice. My view is that I\u2019ve never focused on someone\u2019s personal life: my work is about society, community, humanity \u2013 it\u2019s not about one particular person.</p> <p>I took this shot on the first day I started to work on the series. It was nerve-racking: I had no idea how the pictures were going to look and I didn\u2019t know how people would respond to me. That evening at home, I looked through the day\u2019s work. Nothing was right apart from this shot. This image convinced me that the whole project was worth pursuing. For that reason alone, it\u2019s special to me.</p> <p>The image tells a story: you can see the very shade of the woman\u2019s lipstick, you can see the veins in her legs, but despite the specificity of the shot, it\u2019s also oddly surreal. There\u2019s a kind of dissonance in it that appeals to me.</p> <p>As in <a href=\"http://www.tadaocern.com/gallery_comfort_zone.html\">the rest of the serie</a>s, the bodies you see are real. They are bodies you don\u2019t often see in magazines, online or on social media. Every day we are bombarded with images of people eating perfectly healthy food and being perfectly in shape, and so many people feel excluded by that. The reality we are so often presented with is utterly distorted and represents the minority of us.</p> <p>I don\u2019t consider the beach as a utopian escape from the city, but it does illustrate how our behaviour is conditioned by social norms beyond our control. Why is it acceptable to be half naked on a beach, but not in a library? Why does our environment dictate what we can and cannot wear? It\u2019s because our behaviour is always being shaped by people around us.</p> <p>In the age of social media, we are obsessed with the concept of individuality and the idea that we must all be different all of the time. These images show that, on some level, we just do what everyone else does. The individual is much less important than the collective or the whole.</p> <p>I travelled to other beaches across the world, thinking it would be interesting to document how beach culture differs. What I found is that it doesn\u2019t. We buy the same things, we often read the same things translated into whatever language we speak and we use the same brands a lot of the time. You can see globalisation in action on the beach, and how consumerism shapes all of our lives. But you can also see a kind of commonality, the similarities between us, no matter where in the world we are.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dcda30215e47cf7b6e3be5655939d0b6758eb45e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcda30215e47cf7b6e3be5655939d0b6758eb45e/0_0_3627_4636/782.jpg\" alt=\"Tadao Cern in bathed in all-white in a self-portrait\" width=\"782\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.tadaocern.com/\">Tadao Cern</a>\u2019s CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> \u0160iauliai, Lithuania, 1983.</p> <p><strong>Studied:</strong> MA in Architecture at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University.</p> <p><strong>Influences:</strong> \u201cEverything I have seen and experienced has impacted me.

That evening at home, I looked through the day\u2019s work. Nothing was right apart from this shot. This image convinced me that the whole project was worth pursuing. For that reason alone, it\u2019s special to me. The image tells a story: you can see the very shade of the woman\u2019s lipstick, you can see the veins in her legs, but despite the specificity of the shot, it\u2019s also oddly surreal. There\u2019s a kind of dissonance in it that appeals to me. As in the rest of the series, the bodies you see are real. They are bodies you don\u2019t often see in magazines, online or on social media. Every day we are bombarded with images of people eating perfectly healthy food and being perfectly in shape, and so many people feel excluded by that. The reality we are so often presented with is utterly distorted and represents the minority of us. I don\u2019t consider the beach as a utopian escape from the city, but it does illustrate how our behaviour is conditioned by social norms beyond our control. Why is it acceptable to be half naked on a beach, but not in a library? Why does our environment dictate what we can and cannot wear? It\u2019s because our behaviour is always being shaped by people around us. In the age of social media, we are obsessed with the concept of individuality and the idea that we must all be different all of the time. These images show that, on some level, we just do what everyone else does. The individual is much less important than the collective or the whole. I travelled to other beaches across the world, thinking it would be interesting to document how beach culture differs. What I found is that it doesn\u2019t. We buy the same things, we often read the same things translated into whatever language we speak and we use the same brands a lot of the time. You can see globalisation in action on the beach, and how consumerism shapes all of our lives. But you can also see a kind of commonality, the similarities between us, no matter where in the world we are. Tadao Cern\u2019s CV Born: \u0160iauliai, Lithuania, 1983.

      "body": "<p>On a sweltering Thursday evening in Manhattan last month, people across New York City were preparing for what meteorologists predicted would be the hottest weekend of the year. Over the past two decades, every record for peak electricity use in the city has occurred during a heatwave, as millions of people turn on their air conditioning units at the same time. And so, at the midtown headquarters of Con Edison, the company that supplies more than 10 million people in the New York area with electricity, employees were busy turning a conference room on the 19th floor into an emergency command centre.</p> <p>Inside the conference room, close to 80 engineers and company executives, joined by representatives of the city\u2019s emergency management department, monitored the status of the city power grid, directed ground crews and watched a set of dials displaying each borough\u2019s electricity use tick upward. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bridge in Star Trek in there,\u201d Anthony Suozzo, a former senior system operator with the company, told me. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all hands on deck, they\u2019re telling Scotty to fix things, the system is running at max capacity.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/sep/06/the-air-conditioning-trap-how-cold-air-is-heating-the-world-podcast\">The air conditioning trap: how cold air is heating the world \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Power grids are measured by the amount of electricity that can pass through them at any one time. Con Edison\u2019s grid, with 62 power substations and more than 130,000 miles of power lines and cables across New York City and Westchester County, can deliver 13,400MW every second. This is roughly equivalent to 18m horsepower.</p> <p>On a regular day, New York City demands around 10,000MW every second; during a heatwave, that figure can exceed 13,000MW. \u201cDo the math, whatever that gap is, is the AC,\u201d Michael Clendenin, a company spokesman, told me. The combination of high demand and extreme temperature can cause parts of the system to overheat and fail, leading to blackouts. In 2006, equipment failure left 175,000 people <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/22/nyregion/22astoria.html\" title=\"\">in Queens without power for a week</a>, during a heatwave that killed 40 people.</p> <p>This year, by the evening of Sunday 21 July, with temperatures above 36C (97F) and demand at more than 12,000MW every second, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/brooklyn-queens-power-outage-con-edison-blackout-heat-wave-1450420\" title=\"\">Con Edison cut power</a> to 50,000 customers in Brooklyn and Queens for 24 hours, afraid that parts of the nearby grid were close to collapse, which could have left hundreds of thousands of people without power for days. The state had to send in police to help residents, and Con Edison crews dispensed dry ice for people to cool their homes.</p> <p>As the world gets hotter, scenes like these will become increasingly common. Buying an air conditioner is perhaps the most popular individual response to climate change, and air conditioners are almost uniquely power-hungry appliances: a small unit cooling a single room, on average, consumes more power than running four fridges, while a central unit cooling an average house uses more power than 15. \u201cLast year in Beijing, during a heatwave, 50% of the power capacity was going to air conditioning,\u201d says John Dulac, an analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA). \u201cThese are \u2018oh shit\u2019 moments.\u201d</p> <p>There are just over 1bn single-room air conditioning units in the world right now \u2013 about one for every seven people on earth. Numerous reports have projected that by 2050 there are likely to be more than 4.5bn, making them as ubiquitous as the mobile phone is today. The US already uses as much electricity for air conditioning each year as the UK uses in total. The IEA projects that as the rest of the world reaches similar levels, air conditioning will use about 13% of all electricity worldwide, and produce 2bn tonnes of CO2 a year \u2013 about the same amount as India, the world\u2019s third-largest emitter, produces today.</p> <p>All of these reports note the awful irony of this feedback loop: warmer temperatures lead to more air conditioning; more air conditioning leads to warmer temperatures. The problem posed by air conditioning resembles, in miniature, the problem we face in tackling the climate crisis. The solutions that we reach for most easily only bind us closer to the original problem.</p> <p>The global dominance of air conditioning was not inevitable. As recently as 1990, there were only about 400m air conditioning units in the world, mostly in the US. Originally built for industrial use, air conditioning eventually came to be seen as essential, a symbol of modernity and comfort. Then air conditioning went global. Today, as with other drivers of the climate crisis, we race to find solutions \u2013 and puzzle over how we ended up so closely tied to a technology that turns out to be drowning us.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Like the aqueduct or the automobile, air conditioning is a technology that transformed the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/22/singapore-lee-kuan-yew-dies-91\" title=\"\">Lee Kuan Yew</a>, the first prime minister of independent Singapore, called it \u201cone of the signal inventions of history\u201d that allowed the rapid modernisation of his tropical country. In 1998, the American academic Richard Nathan told the New York Times that, along with the \u201ccivil rights revolution\u201d, air conditioning <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/29/arts/think-tank-studying-how-the-defeat-of-heat-changed-nearly-everything.html\" title=\"\">had been the biggest factor in changing American demography and politics</a> over the previous three decades, enabling extensive residential development in the very hot, and very conservative, American south.</p> <p>A century ago, few would have predicted this. For the first 50 years of its existence, air conditioning was mainly restricted to factories and a handful of public spaces. The initial invention is credited to Willis Carrier, an American engineer at a heating and ventilation company, who was tasked in 1902 with reducing humidity in a Brooklyn printing factory. Today we assume that the purpose of air conditioning is to reduce heat, but engineers at the time weren\u2019t solely concerned with temperature. They wanted to create the most stable possible conditions for industrial production \u2013 and in a print factory, humidity curled sheets of paper and smudged ink.</p> <p>Carrier realised that removing heat from the factory air would reduce humidity, and so he borrowed technology from the nascent refrigeration industry to create what was, and still is, essentially a jacked-up fridge. Then as now, air conditioning units work by breathing in warm air, passing it across a cold surface, and exhaling cool, dry air. The invention was an immediate success with industry \u2013 textile, ammunition, and pharmaceutical factories were among the first adopters \u2013 and then began to catch on elsewhere. The House of Representatives installed air conditioning in 1928, followed by the White House and the Senate in 1929. But during this period, most Americans encountered air conditioning only in places such as theatres or department stores, where it was seen as a delightful novelty.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the late 1940s, when it began to enter people\u2019s homes, that the air conditioner really conquered the US. Before then, according to the historian Gail Cooper, the industry had struggled to convince the public that air conditioning was a necessity, rather than a luxury. In her definitive account of the early days of the industry, Air-Conditioning America, Cooper notes that magazines described air conditioning as a flop with consumers. Fortune called it \u201ca prime public disappointment of the 1930s\u201d. By 1938 only one out of every 400 American homes had an air conditioner; today it is closer to nine out of 10.</p> <p>What fuelled the rise of the air conditioning was not a sudden explosion in consumer demand, but the influence of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/26/how-america-became-addicted-to-air-conditioning\" title=\"\"> industries behind the great postwar housing boom</a>. Between 1946 and 1965, 31m new homes were constructed in the US, and for the people building those houses, air conditioning was a godsend. Architects and construction companies no longer had to worry much about differences in climate \u2013 they could sell the same style of home just as easily in New Mexico as in Delaware. The prevailing mentality was that just about any problems caused by hot climates, cheap building materials, shoddy design or poor city planning could be overcome, as the American Institute of Architects wrote in 1973, \u201cby the brute application of more air conditioning\u201d. As Cooper writes, \u201cArchitects, builders and bankers accepted air conditioning first, and consumers were faced with a fait accompli that they merely had to ratify.\u201d</p> <p>Equally essential to the rise of the air conditioner were electric utilities \u2013 the companies that operate power plants and sell electricity to consumers. Electric utilities benefit from every new house hooked up to their grid, but throughout the early 20th century they were also looking for ways to get these new customers to use even more electricity in their homes. This process was known as \u201cload building\u201d, after the industry term (load) for the amount of electricity used at any one time. \u201cThe cost of electricity was low, which was fine by the utilities. They simply increased demand, and encouraged customers to use more electricity so they could keep expanding and building new power plants,\u201d says Richard Hirsh, a historian of technology at Virginia Tech.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"984cec85b8910f29c006eb2368c30280476b37fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/984cec85b8910f29c006eb2368c30280476b37fa/0_0_3822_2946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Willis Carrier demonstrates air conditioning at the New York World\u2019s Fair in 1939.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"771\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willis Carrier demonstrates air conditioning at the New York World\u2019s Fair in 1939.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The utilities quickly recognised that air conditioning was a serious load builder. As early as 1935, Commonwealth Edison, the precursor to the modern Con Edison, noted in its end-of-year report that the power demand from air conditioners was growing at 50% a year, and \u201coffered substantial potential for the future\u201d. That same year, Electric Light &amp; Power, an industry trade magazine, reported that utilities in big cities \u201care now pushing air conditioning. For their own good, all power companies should be very active in this field.\u201d</p> <p>By the 1950s, that future had arrived. Electric utilities ran print, radio and film adverts promoting air conditioning, as well as offering financing and discount rates to construction companies that installed it. In 1957, Commonwealth Edison reported that for the first time, peak electricity usage had occurred not in the winter, when households were turning up their heating, but during summer, when people were turning on their air-conditioning units. By 1970, 35% of American houses had air conditioning, more than 200 times the number just three decades earlier.</p> <p>At the same time, air-conditioning-hungry commercial buildings were springing up across the US. The all-glass skyscraper, a building style that, because of its poor reflective properties and lack of ventilation, often requires more than half its electricity output be reserved for air conditioning, became an American mainstay. Between 1950 and 1970 the average electricity used per square foot in commercial buildings more than doubled. New York\u2019s World Trade Center, completed in 1974, had what was then the world\u2019s largest AC unit, with nine enormous engines and more than 270km of piping for cooling and heating. Commentators at the time noted that it used the same amount of electricity each day as the nearby city of Schenectady, population 80,000.</p> <p>The air-conditioning industry, construction companies and electric utilities were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/aug/14/how-air-conditioning-created-modern-city\" title=\"\">all riding the great wave of post</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/aug/14/how-air-conditioning-created-modern-city\" title=\"\">war American capitalism</a>. In their pursuit of profit, they ensured that the air conditioner became an essential element of American life. \u201cOur children are raised in an air-conditioned culture,\u201d an AC company executive told Time magazine in 1968. \u201cYou can\u2019t really expect them to live in a home that isn\u2019t air conditioned.\u201d Over time, the public found they liked air conditioning, and its use continued to climb, reaching 87% of US households by 2009.</p> <p>The postwar building spree was underpinned by the idea that all of these new buildings would consume incredible amounts of power, and that this would not present any serious problems in the future. In 1992, the journal Energy and Buildings published <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037877889290017B\" title=\"\">an article by the British conservative academic Gwyn Prins</a>, arguing that the American addiction to air conditioning was a symbol of its profound decadence. Prins summarised America\u2019s guiding credo as: \u201cWe shall be cool, our plates shall overflow and gas shall be $1 a gallon, Amen.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>During the time that air conditioning was reshaping America\u2019s cities, it had little effect elsewhere. (With some exceptions \u2013 Japan, Australia and Singapore were early adopters.) Now, however, air conditioning is finally sweeping across the rest of the world. If the march of air conditioning across the US tracked its postwar building and consumption boom, its more recent expansion has followed the course of globalisation. As the rest of the world adopts more Americanised ways of building and living, air conditioning follows.</p> <p>In the 1990s, many countries across Asia opened up to foreign investment and embarked on an unprecedented urban building spree. Over the past three decades, about 200 million people in India have moved to cities; in China, the number is more than 500 million. From New Delhi to Shanghai, heavily air-conditioned office buildings, hotels and malls began to spring up. These buildings were not only indistinguishable from those in New York or London, but were often constructed by the same builders and architects. \u201cWhen you had this money coming in from the rest of the world for high-end buildings, it often came with an American or European designer or consultancy attached,\u201d says Ashok Lall, an Indian architect who focuses on housing and low-energy design. \u201cAnd so it comes as a package with AC. They thought that meant progress.\u201d</p> <p>As the rate and scale of building intensified, traditional architectural methods for mitigating hot temperatures were jettisoned. Leena Thomas, an Indian professor of architecture at the University of Technology in Sydney, told me that in Delhi in the early 1990s older forms of building design \u2013 which had dealt with heat through window screens, or facades and brise-soleils \u2013 were slowly displaced by American or European styles. \u201cI would say that this international style has a lot to answer for,\u201d she said. Just like the US in the 20th century, but on an even greater scale, homes and offices were increasingly being built in such a way that made air conditioning indispensable. \u201cDevelopers were building without thinking,\u201d says Rajan Rawal, a professor of architecture and city planning at Cept University in Ahmedabad. \u201cThe speed of construction that was required created pressure. So they simply built and relied on technology to fix it later.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/aug/13/halfway-boiling-city-50c\">Halfway to boiling: the city at 50C</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lall says that even with affordable housing it is possible to reduce the need for air conditioning by designing carefully. \u201cYou balance the sizes of opening, the area of the wall, the thermal properties, and shading, the orientation,\u201d he says. But he argues that, in general, developers are not interested. \u201cEven little things like adequate shading and insulation in the rooftop are resisted. The builders don\u2019t appear to see any value in this. They want 10- to 20-storey blocks close to one another. That\u2019s just how business works now, that\u2019s what the cities are forcing us to do. It\u2019s all driven by speculation and land value.\u201d</p> <p>This reliance on air conditioning is a symptom of what the Chinese art critic Hou Hanru has called the epoch of post-planning. Today, planning as we traditionally think of it \u2013 centralised, methodical, preceding development \u2013 is vanishingly rare. Markets dictate and allocate development at incredible speed, and for the actual inhabitants, the conditions they require to live are sourced later, in a piecemeal fashion. \u201cYou see these immense towers go up, and they\u2019re already locking the need for air conditioning into the building,\u201d says Marlyne Sahakian, a sociologist who studies the use of air conditioning in the Philippines.</p> <p>Over coffee recently in London, the influential Malaysian architect Ken Yeang lamented what he viewed as the loss of an entire generation of architects and builders to a dependency on fossil fuels to control the environment. \u201cSo much damage has been done by those buildings,\u201d he says, \u201cI have entirely lost hope in my generation; perhaps the next one can design a rescue mission.\u201d</p> <p>To its proponents, air conditioning is often presented as a simple choice that consumers make to improve their lives as they climb the economic ladder. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a luxury product but a necessity,\u201d an executive at the Indian branch of the Japanese air-conditioner manufacturing giant Daikin told the Associated Press last year. \u201cEveryone deserves AC.\u201d</p> <p>This refrain is as familiar in Rajasthan now as it was in the US 70 years ago. Once air conditioning is embedded in people\u2019s lives, they tend to want to keep it. But that fact obscures the ways that consumers\u2019 choices are shaped by forces beyond their control. In her 1967 book Vietnam, Mary McCarthy reflected on this subtle restriction of choice in American life. \u201cIn American hotel rooms,\u201d she wrote, \u201cyou can decide whether or not to turn on the air conditioning (that is your business), but you cannot open the window.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One step towards solving the problem presented by air conditioning \u2013 and one that doesn\u2019t require a complete overhaul of the modern city \u2013 would be to build a better air conditioner. There is plenty of room for improvement. The invention of air conditioning predates both the first aeroplane and the first public radio broadcast, and the underlying technology has not changed much since 1902. \u201cEverything is still based on the vapour compression cycle; same as a refrigerator. It\u2019s effectively the same process as a century ago,\u201d says Colin Goodwin, the technical director of the Building Services Research and Information Association. \u201cWhat has happened is we\u2019ve expanded the affordability of the air conditioner, but as far as efficiency, they\u2019ve improved but they haven\u2019t leaped.\u201d</p> <p>One scheme to encourage engineers to build a more efficient air conditioner was launched last year by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a US-based energy policy thinktank, and endorsed by the UN environment programme and government of India. They are offering $3m to the winner of the inaugural <a href=\"https://globalcoolingprize.org/\" title=\"\">Global Cooling prize</a>. The aim is to design an air conditioner that is five times more efficient than the current standard model, but which costs no more than twice as much money to produce. They have received more than a hundred entries, from lone inventors to prominent universities, and even research teams from multibillion-dollar appliance giants.</p> <p>But, as with other technological responses to climate change, it is far from certain that the arrival of a more efficient air conditioner will significantly reduce global emissions. According to the RMI, in order to keep total global emissions from new air conditioners from rising, their prize-winning efficient air conditioner would need to go on sale no later than 2022, and capture 80% of the market by 2030. In other words, the new product would have to almost totally replace its rivals in less than a decade. Benjamin Sovacool, professor of energy policy at Sussex University and a lead author on the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, describes this ambition as not impossible, but pretty unlikely.</p> <p>\u201cThis idea of technology saving us is a narrative that we want to believe. Its simplicity is comforting,\u201d he says. It has proven so comforting, in fact, that it is often discussed as if it is our first and best response to climate change \u2013 even as the timeframe for inventing and implementing such technologies becomes so narrow as to strain credulity.</p> <p>New air-conditioner technology would be welcome, but it is perhaps \u201cthe fourth, or maybe fifth thing on the list we should do\u201d to reduce the emissions from air conditioning, says Diana \u00dcrge-Vorsatz, a professor of climate change and energy policy at Central European University, and a lead author on the forthcoming IPCC report. Among the higher priorities that she mentions are planting trees, retrofitting old buildings with proper ventilation, and no longer building \u201cconcrete and glass cages that can\u2019t withstand a heatwave\u201d. She adds: \u201cAll of these things would be cheaper too, in the long run.\u201d </p> <p>But while these things are technically cheaper, they require changes in behaviour and major policy shifts \u2013 and the open secret of the climate crisis is that nobody really knows how to make these kind of changes on the systematic, global scale that the severity of the crisis demands.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>If we are not about to be rescued by technology, and worldwide policy changes look like a distant hope, there remains a very simple way of reducing the environmental damage done by air conditioning: use less of it. But, as the ecological economist and IPCC author <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/sacrifice/\" title=\"\">Julia Steinberger has written</a>, any serious proposals to change our lifestyles \u2013 cutting down on driving, flying or imported avocados \u2013 are considered \u201cbeyond the pale, heretic, almost insane\u201d. This is especially true of air conditioning, where calls to use it less are frequently treated as suggestions that people should die in heatwaves, or evidence of a malicious desire to deny other people the same comforts that citizens in wealthy countries already enjoy.</p> <p>This summer, the publication of a New York Times article asking \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/style/air-conditioning-obsession.html\" title=\"\">Do Americans need air conditioning?</a>\u201d touched off a thousand furious social media posts, uniting figures from the feminist writer and critic Roxane Gay (\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t last a summer week in Florida without it. Get a grip\u201d) to the conservative professor and pundit Tom Nichols (\u201cAir conditioning is why we left the caves \u2026 You will get my AC from me when you pry it from my frozen, frosty hands\u201d).</p> <p>Despite this backlash, there is a reasonable case to be made that we are over-reliant on air conditioning and could cut back. The supposedly ideal indoor temperature has long been determined by air-conditioning engineers, using criteria that suggest pretty much all humans want the same temperature range at all times. The underlying idea is that comfort is objective, and that a building in Jakarta should be the same temperature as one in Boston. In practice, says Leena Thomas, this means that the temperature in most air-conditioned buildings is usually \u201clow-20s plus/minus one\u201d.</p> <p>But not everyone has accepted the notion that there is such as thing as the objectively \u201cright\u201d temperature.

They contend that, whether it is a state of mind or a biological adjustment, human comfort is adaptive, not objective. This is something that seems obvious to many people who live with these temperatures. At a recent conference on air conditioning that I attended in London, an Indian delegate chided the crowd: \u201cIf I can work and function at 30C, you could too \u2013 believe you me.\u201d</p> <p>Adding to the weight of evidence against the idea of the \u201cideal\u201d temperature, Frederick Rohles, a psychologist and member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, has conducted studies showing that subjects who were shown a false thermometer displaying a high temperature felt warm, even if the room was cool. \u201cThese are the sorts of things that drive my engineering colleagues crazy,\u201d he wrote in 2007. \u201cComfort is a state of mind!\u201d</p> <p>Ashok Lall points out that once people are open to the idea that the temperature in a building can change, you can build houses that use air conditioning as a last resort, not a first step. \u201cBut there is no broad culture or regulation underpinning this,\u201d he says. At the moment, it is the deterministic camp that has control of the levers of power \u2013 and their view continues to be reflected in building codes and standards around the world.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>How, then, can we get ourselves out of the air-conditioning trap? On the continuum of habits and technologies that we need to reduce or abandon if we are to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis, the air conditioner probably falls somewhere in the middle: harder to reduce than our habit of eating meat five times a week; easier than eliminating the fossil-fuel automobile.</p> <p>According to Nick Mabey, a former senior civil servant who runs the UK-based climate politics consultancy E3G, air conditioning has \u2013 like many consumer products that are deeply embedded in society and, in aggregate, drive global warming \u2013 escaped the notice of most governments. There is little precedent for top-down regulation. \u201cThere is no department that handles this, there\u2019s no guy you can just go talk to who controls air conditioning,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The key, Mabey says, is to find the places it can be controlled, and begin the push there. He is supporting a UN programme that aims to improve the efficiency \u2013 and thus reduce the emissions \u2013 of all air conditioners sold worldwide. It falls under the unglamorous label of consumer standards. Currently, the average air conditioner on the market is about half as efficient as the best available unit. Closing that gap even a little bit would take a big chunk out of future emissions.</p> <p>At the local level, some progress is being made. The New York City council recently passed far-reaching legislation requiring <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/nyregion/greenhouse-gases-ny.html\" title=\"\">all large buildings in the city to reduce their overall emissions</a> by 40% by 2030, with a goal of 80% by 2050, backed with hefty fines for offenders. Costa Constantinides, the city council member spearheading the legislation, says it is \u201cthe largest carbon-emissions reduction ever mandated by any city, anywhere\u201d. The Los Angeles mayor\u2019s office is working on similar plans, to make all buildings net-zero carbon by 2050.</p> <p>Other cities are taking even more direct action. In the mid-1980s, Geneva, which has a warmer climate than much of the US, the local government banned the installation of air conditioning except by special permission. This approach is relatively common across Switzerland and, as a result, air conditioning accounts for less than 2% of all electricity used. The Swiss don\u2019t appear to miss air conditioning too much \u2013 its absence is rarely discussed, and they have largely learned to do without.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/25/hand-dryers-paper-towels-hygiene-dyson-airblade\">Hand dryers v paper towels: the surprisingly dirty fight for the right to dry your hands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In countries where air conditioning is still relatively new, an immense opportunity exists to find alternatives before it becomes a way of life. The aim, in the words of Thomas, should be to avoid \u201cthe worst of the west\u201d. Recently, the Indian government adopted recommendations by Thomas, Rawal and others into its countrywide national residential building code (\u201can immensely powerful document\u201d says Rawal).

But before, people knew how to work with the climate,\u201d says Ken Yeang. \u201cAir conditioning became a way to control it, and it was no longer a concern. No one saw the consequences.

      "bodyText": "On a sweltering Thursday evening in Manhattan last month, people across New York City were preparing for what meteorologists predicted would be the hottest weekend of the year. Over the past two decades, every record for peak electricity use in the city has occurred during a heatwave, as millions of people turn on their air conditioning units at the same time. And so, at the midtown headquarters of Con Edison, the company that supplies more than 10 million people in the New York area with electricity, employees were busy turning a conference room on the 19th floor into an emergency command centre. Inside the conference room, close to 80 engineers and company executives, joined by representatives of the city\u2019s emergency management department, monitored the status of the city power grid, directed ground crews and watched a set of dials displaying each borough\u2019s electricity use tick upward. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bridge in Star Trek in there,\u201d Anthony Suozzo, a former senior system operator with the company, told me. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all hands on deck, they\u2019re telling Scotty to fix things, the system is running at max capacity.\u201d Power grids are measured by the amount of electricity that can pass through them at any one time. Con Edison\u2019s grid, with 62 power substations and more than 130,000 miles of power lines and cables across New York City and Westchester County, can deliver 13,400MW every second. This is roughly equivalent to 18m horsepower. On a regular day, New York City demands around 10,000MW every second; during a heatwave, that figure can exceed 13,000MW. \u201cDo the math, whatever that gap is, is the AC,\u201d Michael Clendenin, a company spokesman, told me. The combination of high demand and extreme temperature can cause parts of the system to overheat and fail, leading to blackouts. In 2006, equipment failure left 175,000 people in Queens without power for a week, during a heatwave that killed 40 people. This year, by the evening of Sunday 21 July, with temperatures above 36C (97F) and demand at more than 12,000MW every second, Con Edison cut power to 50,000 customers in Brooklyn and Queens for 24 hours, afraid that parts of the nearby grid were close to collapse, which could have left hundreds of thousands of people without power for days. The state had to send in police to help residents, and Con Edison crews dispensed dry ice for people to cool their homes. As the world gets hotter, scenes like these will become increasingly common. Buying an air conditioner is perhaps the most popular individual response to climate change, and air conditioners are almost uniquely power-hungry appliances: a small unit cooling a single room, on average, consumes more power than running four fridges, while a central unit cooling an average house uses more power than 15. \u201cLast year in Beijing, during a heatwave, 50% of the power capacity was going to air conditioning,\u201d says John Dulac, an analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA). \u201cThese are \u2018oh shit\u2019 moments.\u201d There are just over 1bn single-room air conditioning units in the world right now \u2013 about one for every seven people on earth. Numerous reports have projected that by 2050 there are likely to be more than 4.5bn, making them as ubiquitous as the mobile phone is today. The US already uses as much electricity for air conditioning each year as the UK uses in total. The IEA projects that as the rest of the world reaches similar levels, air conditioning will use about 13% of all electricity worldwide, and produce 2bn tonnes of CO2 a year \u2013 about the same amount as India, the world\u2019s third-largest emitter, produces today. All of these reports note the awful irony of this feedback loop: warmer temperatures lead to more air conditioning; more air conditioning leads to warmer temperatures. The problem posed by air conditioning resembles, in miniature, the problem we face in tackling the climate crisis. The solutions that we reach for most easily only bind us closer to the original problem. The global dominance of air conditioning was not inevitable. As recently as 1990, there were only about 400m air conditioning units in the world, mostly in the US. Originally built for industrial use, air conditioning eventually came to be seen as essential, a symbol of modernity and comfort. Then air conditioning went global. Today, as with other drivers of the climate crisis, we race to find solutions \u2013 and puzzle over how we ended up so closely tied to a technology that turns out to be drowning us. * * * Like the aqueduct or the automobile, air conditioning is a technology that transformed the world. Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of independent Singapore, called it \u201cone of the signal inventions of history\u201d that allowed the rapid modernisation of his tropical country. In 1998, the American academic Richard Nathan told the New York Times that, along with the \u201ccivil rights revolution\u201d, air conditioning had been the biggest factor in changing American demography and politics over the previous three decades, enabling extensive residential development in the very hot, and very conservative, American south. A century ago, few would have predicted this. For the first 50 years of its existence, air conditioning was mainly restricted to factories and a handful of public spaces. The initial invention is credited to Willis Carrier, an American engineer at a heating and ventilation company, who was tasked in 1902 with reducing humidity in a Brooklyn printing factory. Today we assume that the purpose of air conditioning is to reduce heat, but engineers at the time weren\u2019t solely concerned with temperature. They wanted to create the most stable possible conditions for industrial production \u2013 and in a print factory, humidity curled sheets of paper and smudged ink. Carrier realised that removing heat from the factory air would reduce humidity, and so he borrowed technology from the nascent refrigeration industry to create what was, and still is, essentially a jacked-up fridge. Then as now, air conditioning units work by breathing in warm air, passing it across a cold surface, and exhaling cool, dry air. The invention was an immediate success with industry \u2013 textile, ammunition, and pharmaceutical factories were among the first adopters \u2013 and then began to catch on elsewhere. The House of Representatives installed air conditioning in 1928, followed by the White House and the Senate in 1929. But during this period, most Americans encountered air conditioning only in places such as theatres or department stores, where it was seen as a delightful novelty. It wasn\u2019t until the late 1940s, when it began to enter people\u2019s homes, that the air conditioner really conquered the US. Before then, according to the historian Gail Cooper, the industry had struggled to convince the public that air conditioning was a necessity, rather than a luxury. In her definitive account of the early days of the industry, Air-Conditioning America, Cooper notes that magazines described air conditioning as a flop with consumers. Fortune called it \u201ca prime public disappointment of the 1930s\u201d. By 1938 only one out of every 400 American homes had an air conditioner; today it is closer to nine out of 10. What fuelled the rise of the air conditioning was not a sudden explosion in consumer demand, but the influence of the industries behind the great postwar housing boom. Between 1946 and 1965, 31m new homes were constructed in the US, and for the people building those houses, air conditioning was a godsend. Architects and construction companies no longer had to worry much about differences in climate \u2013 they could sell the same style of home just as easily in New Mexico as in Delaware. The prevailing mentality was that just about any problems caused by hot climates, cheap building materials, shoddy design or poor city planning could be overcome, as the American Institute of Architects wrote in 1973, \u201cby the brute application of more air conditioning\u201d. As Cooper writes, \u201cArchitects, builders and bankers accepted air conditioning first, and consumers were faced with a fait accompli that they merely had to ratify.\u201d Equally essential to the rise of the air conditioner were electric utilities \u2013 the companies that operate power plants and sell electricity to consumers. Electric utilities benefit from every new house hooked up to their grid, but throughout the early 20th century they were also looking for ways to get these new customers to use even more electricity in their homes. This process was known as \u201cload building\u201d, after the industry term (load) for the amount of electricity used at any one time. \u201cThe cost of electricity was low, which was fine by the utilities. They simply increased demand, and encouraged customers to use more electricity so they could keep expanding and building new power plants,\u201d says Richard Hirsh, a historian of technology at Virginia Tech. The utilities quickly recognised that air conditioning was a serious load builder. As early as 1935, Commonwealth Edison, the precursor to the modern Con Edison, noted in its end-of-year report that the power demand from air conditioners was growing at 50% a year, and \u201coffered substantial potential for the future\u201d. That same year, Electric Light &amp; Power, an industry trade magazine, reported that utilities in big cities \u201care now pushing air conditioning. For their own good, all power companies should be very active in this field.\u201d By the 1950s, that future had arrived. Electric utilities ran print, radio and film adverts promoting air conditioning, as well as offering financing and discount rates to construction companies that installed it. In 1957, Commonwealth Edison reported that for the first time, peak electricity usage had occurred not in the winter, when households were turning up their heating, but during summer, when people were turning on their air-conditioning units. By 1970, 35% of American houses had air conditioning, more than 200 times the number just three decades earlier. At the same time, air-conditioning-hungry commercial buildings were springing up across the US. The all-glass skyscraper, a building style that, because of its poor reflective properties and lack of ventilation, often requires more than half its electricity output be reserved for air conditioning, became an American mainstay. Between 1950 and 1970 the average electricity used per square foot in commercial buildings more than doubled. New York\u2019s World Trade Center, completed in 1974, had what was then the world\u2019s largest AC unit, with nine enormous engines and more than 270km of piping for cooling and heating. Commentators at the time noted that it used the same amount of electricity each day as the nearby city of Schenectady, population 80,000. The air-conditioning industry, construction companies and electric utilities were all riding the great wave of postwar American capitalism. In their pursuit of profit, they ensured that the air conditioner became an essential element of American life. \u201cOur children are raised in an air-conditioned culture,\u201d an AC company executive told Time magazine in 1968. \u201cYou can\u2019t really expect them to live in a home that isn\u2019t air conditioned.\u201d Over time, the public found they liked air conditioning, and its use continued to climb, reaching 87% of US households by 2009. The postwar building spree was underpinned by the idea that all of these new buildings would consume incredible amounts of power, and that this would not present any serious problems in the future. In 1992, the journal Energy and Buildings published an article by the British conservative academic Gwyn Prins, arguing that the American addiction to air conditioning was a symbol of its profound decadence. Prins summarised America\u2019s guiding credo as: \u201cWe shall be cool, our plates shall overflow and gas shall be $1 a gallon, Amen.\u201d * * * During the time that air conditioning was reshaping America\u2019s cities, it had little effect elsewhere. (With some exceptions \u2013 Japan, Australia and Singapore were early adopters.) Now, however, air conditioning is finally sweeping across the rest of the world. If the march of air conditioning across the US tracked its postwar building and consumption boom, its more recent expansion has followed the course of globalisation. As the rest of the world adopts more Americanised ways of building and living, air conditioning follows. In the 1990s, many countries across Asia opened up to foreign investment and embarked on an unprecedented urban building spree. Over the past three decades, about 200 million people in India have moved to cities; in China, the number is more than 500 million. From New Delhi to Shanghai, heavily air-conditioned office buildings, hotels and malls began to spring up. These buildings were not only indistinguishable from those in New York or London, but were often constructed by the same builders and architects. \u201cWhen you had this money coming in from the rest of the world for high-end buildings, it often came with an American or European designer or consultancy attached,\u201d says Ashok Lall, an Indian architect who focuses on housing and low-energy design. \u201cAnd so it comes as a package with AC. They thought that meant progress.\u201d As the rate and scale of building intensified, traditional architectural methods for mitigating hot temperatures were jettisoned. Leena Thomas, an Indian professor of architecture at the University of Technology in Sydney, told me that in Delhi in the early 1990s older forms of building design \u2013 which had dealt with heat through window screens, or facades and brise-soleils \u2013 were slowly displaced by American or European styles. \u201cI would say that this international style has a lot to answer for,\u201d she said. Just like the US in the 20th century, but on an even greater scale, homes and offices were increasingly being built in such a way that made air conditioning indispensable. \u201cDevelopers were building without thinking,\u201d says Rajan Rawal, a professor of architecture and city planning at Cept University in Ahmedabad. \u201cThe speed of construction that was required created pressure. So they simply built and relied on technology to fix it later.\u201d Lall says that even with affordable housing it is possible to reduce the need for air conditioning by designing carefully. \u201cYou balance the sizes of opening, the area of the wall, the thermal properties, and shading, the orientation,\u201d he says. But he argues that, in general, developers are not interested. \u201cEven little things like adequate shading and insulation in the rooftop are resisted. The builders don\u2019t appear to see any value in this. They want 10- to 20-storey blocks close to one another. That\u2019s just how business works now, that\u2019s what the cities are forcing us to do. It\u2019s all driven by speculation and land value.\u201d This reliance on air conditioning is a symptom of what the Chinese art critic Hou Hanru has called the epoch of post-planning. Today, planning as we traditionally think of it \u2013 centralised, methodical, preceding development \u2013 is vanishingly rare. Markets dictate and allocate development at incredible speed, and for the actual inhabitants, the conditions they require to live are sourced later, in a piecemeal fashion. \u201cYou see these immense towers go up, and they\u2019re already locking the need for air conditioning into the building,\u201d says Marlyne Sahakian, a sociologist who studies the use of air conditioning in the Philippines. Over coffee recently in London, the influential Malaysian architect Ken Yeang lamented what he viewed as the loss of an entire generation of architects and builders to a dependency on fossil fuels to control the environment. \u201cSo much damage has been done by those buildings,\u201d he says, \u201cI have entirely lost hope in my generation; perhaps the next one can design a rescue mission.\u201d To its proponents, air conditioning is often presented as a simple choice that consumers make to improve their lives as they climb the economic ladder. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a luxury product but a necessity,\u201d an executive at the Indian branch of the Japanese air-conditioner manufacturing giant Daikin told the Associated Press last year. \u201cEveryone deserves AC.\u201d This refrain is as familiar in Rajasthan now as it was in the US 70 years ago. Once air conditioning is embedded in people\u2019s lives, they tend to want to keep it. But that fact obscures the ways that consumers\u2019 choices are shaped by forces beyond their control. In her 1967 book Vietnam, Mary McCarthy reflected on this subtle restriction of choice in American life. \u201cIn American hotel rooms,\u201d she wrote, \u201cyou can decide whether or not to turn on the air conditioning (that is your business), but you cannot open the window.\u201d * * * One step towards solving the problem presented by air conditioning \u2013 and one that doesn\u2019t require a complete overhaul of the modern city \u2013 would be to build a better air conditioner. There is plenty of room for improvement. The invention of air conditioning predates both the first aeroplane and the first public radio broadcast, and the underlying technology has not changed much since 1902. \u201cEverything is still based on the vapour compression cycle; same as a refrigerator. It\u2019s effectively the same process as a century ago,\u201d says Colin Goodwin, the technical director of the Building Services Research and Information Association. \u201cWhat has happened is we\u2019ve expanded the affordability of the air conditioner, but as far as efficiency, they\u2019ve improved but they haven\u2019t leaped.\u201d One scheme to encourage engineers to build a more efficient air conditioner was launched last year by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a US-based energy policy thinktank, and endorsed by the UN environment programme and government of India. They are offering $3m to the winner of the inaugural Global Cooling prize. The aim is to design an air conditioner that is five times more efficient than the current standard model, but which costs no more than twice as much money to produce. They have received more than a hundred entries, from lone inventors to prominent universities, and even research teams from multibillion-dollar appliance giants. But, as with other technological responses to climate change, it is far from certain that the arrival of a more efficient air conditioner will significantly reduce global emissions. According to the RMI, in order to keep total global emissions from new air conditioners from rising, their prize-winning efficient air conditioner would need to go on sale no later than 2022, and capture 80% of the market by 2030. In other words, the new product would have to almost totally replace its rivals in less than a decade. Benjamin Sovacool, professor of energy policy at Sussex University and a lead author on the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, describes this ambition as not impossible, but pretty unlikely. \u201cThis idea of technology saving us is a narrative that we want to believe. Its simplicity is comforting,\u201d he says. It has proven so comforting, in fact, that it is often discussed as if it is our first and best response to climate change \u2013 even as the timeframe for inventing and implementing such technologies becomes so narrow as to strain credulity. New air-conditioner technology would be welcome, but it is perhaps \u201cthe fourth, or maybe fifth thing on the list we should do\u201d to reduce the emissions from air conditioning, says Diana \u00dcrge-Vorsatz, a professor of climate change and energy policy at Central European University, and a lead author on the forthcoming IPCC report. Among the higher priorities that she mentions are planting trees, retrofitting old buildings with proper ventilation, and no longer building \u201cconcrete and glass cages that can\u2019t withstand a heatwave\u201d. She adds: \u201cAll of these things would be cheaper too, in the long run.\u201d But while these things are technically cheaper, they require changes in behaviour and major policy shifts \u2013 and the open secret of the climate crisis is that nobody really knows how to make these kind of changes on the systematic, global scale that the severity of the crisis demands. * * * If we are not about to be rescued by technology, and worldwide policy changes look like a distant hope, there remains a very simple way of reducing the environmental damage done by air conditioning: use less of it. But, as the ecological economist and IPCC author Julia Steinberger has written, any serious proposals to change our lifestyles \u2013 cutting down on driving, flying or imported avocados \u2013 are considered \u201cbeyond the pale, heretic, almost insane\u201d. This is especially true of air conditioning, where calls to use it less are frequently treated as suggestions that people should die in heatwaves, or evidence of a malicious desire to deny other people the same comforts that citizens in wealthy countries already enjoy. This summer, the publication of a New York Times article asking \u201cDo Americans need air conditioning?\u201d touched off a thousand furious social media posts, uniting figures from the feminist writer and critic Roxane Gay (\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t last a summer week in Florida without it. Get a grip\u201d) to the conservative professor and pundit Tom Nichols (\u201cAir conditioning is why we left the caves \u2026 You will get my AC from me when you pry it from my frozen, frosty hands\u201d). Despite this backlash, there is a reasonable case to be made that we are over-reliant on air conditioning and could cut back. The supposedly ideal indoor temperature has long been determined by air-conditioning engineers, using criteria that suggest pretty much all humans want the same temperature range at all times. The underlying idea is that comfort is objective, and that a building in Jakarta should be the same temperature as one in Boston. In practice, says Leena Thomas, this means that the temperature in most air-conditioned buildings is usually \u201clow-20s plus/minus one\u201d. But not everyone has accepted the notion that there is such as thing as the objectively \u201cright\u201d temperature. Studies have suggested that men have different ideal temperatures from women. In offices around the world, \u201cMen toil in their dream temperatures, while women are left to shiver,\u201d argued a 2015 article in the Telegraph, one of many suggesting that the scientific research had simply confirmed something millions of women already knew. Researchers have also shown that people who live in hotter areas, even for a very short time, are comfortable at higher indoor temperatures. They contend that, whether it is a state of mind or a biological adjustment, human comfort is adaptive, not objective. This is something that seems obvious to many people who live with these temperatures. At a recent conference on air conditioning that I attended in London, an Indian delegate chided the crowd: \u201cIf I can work and function at 30C, you could too \u2013 believe you me.\u201d Adding to the weight of evidence against the idea of the \u201cideal\u201d temperature, Frederick Rohles, a psychologist and member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, has conducted studies showing that subjects who were shown a false thermometer displaying a high temperature felt warm, even if the room was cool. \u201cThese are the sorts of things that drive my engineering colleagues crazy,\u201d he wrote in 2007. \u201cComfort is a state of mind!\u201d Ashok Lall points out that once people are open to the idea that the temperature in a building can change, you can build houses that use air conditioning as a last resort, not a first step. \u201cBut there is no broad culture or regulation underpinning this,\u201d he says. At the moment, it is the deterministic camp that has control of the levers of power \u2013 and their view continues to be reflected in building codes and standards around the world. * * * How, then, can we get ourselves out of the air-conditioning trap? On the continuum of habits and technologies that we need to reduce or abandon if we are to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis, the air conditioner probably falls somewhere in the middle: harder to reduce than our habit of eating meat five times a week; easier than eliminating the fossil-fuel automobile. According to Nick Mabey, a former senior civil servant who runs the UK-based climate politics consultancy E3G, air conditioning has \u2013 like many consumer products that are deeply embedded in society and, in aggregate, drive global warming \u2013 escaped the notice of most governments. There is little precedent for top-down regulation. \u201cThere is no department that handles this, there\u2019s no guy you can just go talk to who controls air conditioning,\u201d he says. The key, Mabey says, is to find the places it can be controlled, and begin the push there. He is supporting a UN programme that aims to improve the efficiency \u2013 and thus reduce the emissions \u2013 of all air conditioners sold worldwide. It falls under the unglamorous label of consumer standards. Currently, the average air conditioner on the market is about half as efficient as the best available unit. Closing that gap even a little bit would take a big chunk out of future emissions. At the local level, some progress is being made. The New York City council recently passed far-reaching legislation requiring all large buildings in the city to reduce their overall emissions by 40% by 2030, with a goal of 80% by 2050, backed with hefty fines for offenders. Costa Constantinides, the city council member spearheading the legislation, says it is \u201cthe largest carbon-emissions reduction ever mandated by any city, anywhere\u201d. The Los Angeles mayor\u2019s office is working on similar plans, to make all buildings net-zero carbon by 2050. Other cities are taking even more direct action. In the mid-1980s, Geneva, which has a warmer climate than much of the US, the local government banned the installation of air conditioning except by special permission. This approach is relatively common across Switzerland and, as a result, air conditioning accounts for less than 2% of all electricity used. The Swiss don\u2019t appear to miss air conditioning too much \u2013 its absence is rarely discussed, and they have largely learned to do without. In countries where air conditioning is still relatively new, an immense opportunity exists to find alternatives before it becomes a way of life. The aim, in the words of Thomas, should be to avoid \u201cthe worst of the west\u201d. Recently, the Indian government adopted recommendations by Thomas, Rawal and others into its countrywide national residential building code (\u201can immensely powerful document\u201d says Rawal). It allows higher indoor temperatures based on Indian field studies \u2013 Indian levels of comfort \u2013 and notes the \u201cgrowing prevalence\u201d of buildings that use air conditioning as a technology of last resort. Cutting down on air conditioning doesn\u2019t mean leaving modernity behind, but it does require facing up to some of its consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of going back to the past. But before, people knew how to work with the climate,\u201d says Ken Yeang. \u201cAir conditioning became a way to control it, and it was no longer a concern. No one saw the consequences. People see them now.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 29 August 2019.

The film is uncompromising in its cultural specificity \u2013 and given its subject matter, one would assume it would mostly appeal to British Asians who lived through the 1980s, Bruce Springsteen fans, and in particular, Asian Bruce Springsteen fans who lived through the 1980s. What I had not appreciated was the power of storytelling to engender empathy. The most common responses to the film were in the ways that audiences found personal connections to the story. I could not have predicted that Israeli women in Jerusalem, white teenage American boys in Omaha, Nebraska and older white women in Australia who had seen the film would all contact me on social media and thank me for telling their story. I had not expected to be approached, at screenings from Glasgow to Seattle, by people who seemingly had nothing in common with the protagonist but said they had connected emotionally with the story. Brendan in Chicago told me that while \u201cwe have very different backgrounds, I found myself reflecting about what it was like for me at that age \u2013 that feeling of being in a place where you feel you don\u2019t fit in but realising it\u2019s what has helped shape you, whether you like it or not\u201d. Beth in Missouri had a pithier summation: \u201cWorlds apart but the same.\u201d In telling a very specific story, it turned out, I was actually telling a universal one. Perhaps I should not have been surprised. After all, I was deeply moved and affected by This Is England, Wild Rose and Annie Hall, even though I am neither a young white English skinhead, a Scottish country-music-loving single mum, nor a neurotic middle-aged American-Jewish comedian. Javed, the central character in my film, is a teenage British Pakistani Muslim. Blinded By the Light is being released at a time when that community is regularly demonised as the other \u2013 both Boris Johnson and Donald Trump have sought to gain political capital by mocking Muslims. I was apprehensive about whether a mainstream audience (white and non-Muslim) would be able to relate to the protagonist, yet it has been illuminating how much they have seen beyond religion and ethnicity and responded to the characters as sons, mothers and fathers \u2013 as human beings. It is, of course, also true that these are a self-selecting group of people who have chosen to buy a ticket for the film, just as people choose to read a particular paper or watch a specific news channel. So one could argue that the film is not changing anyone\u2019s mind, since only those who are disposed to watch it would be willing to spend the money. But when people engage with stories, they arguably do so with minds more open than when they engage with politics. When I asked a packed cinema of more than 700 people \u2013 overwhelmingly white filmgoers \u2013 in Traverse City, Michigan, how many had spent two hours in the company of a Pakistani Muslim family, not a single hand went up. \u201cYou just did,\u201d I told them. The fact that so many people around the world who have seen Blinded By the Light have responded with empathy to characters apparently very different to themselves offers some hope in what can feel like hopeless times. It suggests that stories can reach places that journalism cannot. It makes me believe that perhaps it is just plausible that the next time a fear-stoking politician or an attention-seeking journalist tries to demonise all Muslims, those who have seen and been moved by my film will remember young Javed and his parents, Malik and Noor. And they will recall laughing and crying in the cinema. In a time when politicians seem intent on defining us by our differences, my film may remind them that all of us are characters in a larger human story. \u2022 Sarfraz Manzoor is a journalist and screenwriter. Blinded By the Light, in cinemas now, is based on his 2007 memoir, Greetings from Bury Park",

Since it\u2019s been widely perceived as a tract on millennial womanhood, we assembled three millennial critics for a discussion on the play\u2019s relevance, cult status and sexual politics.</p> <p><strong>Kate Wyver:</strong> After the TV show, the play felt like going to a gallery and looking at the artist\u2019s sketchbooks. The show is just so much more developed, so the play can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointing.</p> <p><strong>Laura Snapes:</strong> I liked seeing the original source material. But the play was originally such a bolt from the blue. If you see it now, you\u2019re always aware: <em>that\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge</em>. When it\u2019s freighted with the phenomenon, it doesn\u2019t work.</p> <p><strong>Hannah J Davies:</strong> It was like MTV Unplugged \u2013 something you already know in a more intimate form. There was a sense that people weren\u2019t getting gratification from connecting with the show, but from seeing someone famous in an intimate setting. People had an expectation that they wanted to see replicated and she did it.</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> Did she get a massive cheer as soon as she walked on?</p> <p><strong>HJD:</strong> Yeah. People were taking photos. The woman next to me laughed at every single line.</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> The laughs were disproportionate to how funny the jokes actually were. The woman next to me paid \u00a3177 to be there and ran out when it finished to get a photo and an autograph. It felt like the cultural capital of being able to say, \u201cI was there\u201d. The crowd was mouthing along.</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> Really?!</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> Yeah \u2013 people pre-empting the laughs, knowing exactly what\u2019s going to happen.</p> <p><strong>HJD:</strong> I understand singing along to a band, but theatre is meant to be a quiet experience.</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> No! I wish people could interact with it more because that was the original idea. You\u2019re in this tiny 60-seater and you feel as if she\u2019s whispering just to you. It removes the intimacy \u2013 I did not feel any intimacy in that room. Did it feel intimate to you?</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> At first, she was looking into the middle distance, and I thought, that\u2019s not going to work. But she started making eye contact. You could see men squirming. What did you think of the play on a technical level?</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> It\u2019s a tough task to keep an audience engaged for an hour when you\u2019re not moving. I couldn\u2019t look away.</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> You saw a lot more of Waller-Bridge as a physical comedian \u2013 especially impersonating all the repressed men in her life. Her face had to do a lot more work than on TV, which was all about the aside. In the theatre, it was all aside, in a way.</p> <p><strong>HJD:</strong> There was one aside where she\u2019s talking about the sister\u2019s husband, and she says, \u201cHe\u2019s not even sexy enough to beat his wife.\u201d And then she says, \u201cJoking!\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell if that was an aside from Fleabag or Waller-Bridge? On TV it\u2019s much more wink-wink. I needed it to feel different for it not to feel like a cash cow.</p> <p><strong>LS: </strong>It\u2019s symptomatic of our cultural inability to let anything end: the franchise of the franchise of the franchise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d00e2523b42e51716bedaa7fbc5ee5c567f2069\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d00e2523b42e51716bedaa7fbc5ee5c567f2069/0_76_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waller-Bridge greets fans after the show at Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waller-Bridge greets fans after the show at Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>KW:</strong> As a play, you could tell it was six years old. The monologue is solid but nothing hugely special. And the staging is incredibly ordinary. I\u2019ve just been at the Edinburgh fringe, where I saw 50 more exciting shows. And when you think how many plays are struggling for a stage, it feels slightly unfair when the same thing gets done again. But then, has there ever been a one-woman show in the West End that has been so financially viable? That in itself is incredible.</p> <p><strong>HJD:</strong> Does it feel dated because people have tried to replicate it?</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> Possibly. In interviews from 2013, when they first staged it, Waller-Bridge says things like, \u201cYou don\u2019t see these characters. Women don\u2019t get to be hedonistic and vulgar and dirty and horny.\u201d And now there\u2019s a lot more of that.</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> Something I\u2019ve found weird is the conflation of Waller-Bridge, who is aspirational because she\u2019s a young woman who made a trailblazing TV show, and the character of Fleabag, into this broad \u201crelatable\u201d figure. Do you think the character is relatable?</p> <p><strong>HJD:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/20/fleabag-posh-girl-television\">It comes back to the piece we published</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/20/fleabag-posh-girl-television\"> about class in Fleabag</a>. The cultural product that Waller-Bridge has made is inherently part of her experiences and it\u2019s only as relatable as the experiences she\u2019s had. She would have made it anyway, whoever she was \u2013 but it would have been very different.</p> <p><strong>LS: </strong>The play was interesting because the staging is so simple \u2013 obviously she\u2019s a thin, quite posh white woman, but you don\u2019t see her dad\u2019s house, which is one of the big class tells in the TV show. So it doesn\u2019t have the same baggage. I think the construct of Fleabag tries to reject the basics of relatability. It actively tries to resist people relating to the character in a superficial way. She doesn\u2019t have any cultural signifiers, so you can\u2019t relate to her because you both like the same bands or books, and she dresses plainly. It\u2019s kind of a clean emotional slate \u2013 although obviously as a white woman she\u2019s seen as a cultural \u201cdefault\u201d, so she eschews the baggage that a woman of colour would automatically have to carry.</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> There\u2019s that line in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/15/lady-bird-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-laurie-metcalf\">Lady Bird</a> where someone says, \u201clove and attention, it\u2019s basically the same thing\u201d. Fleabag feeds off that. I can really understand that and also love how she covers her insecurities with cynicism and humour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eee788bc26f1c09c41c7d3f0436a2d182687025b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eee788bc26f1c09c41c7d3f0436a2d182687025b/0_256_4103_2461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Sian Clifford and Olivia Colman in Fleabag the TV show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Sian Clifford and Olivia Colman in Fleabag the TV show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Baker/BBC/Two Brothers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>LS:</strong> In the play, she\u2019s surprisingly cruel compared to the show. There are several fat jokes. I was sitting next to a large guy, who was laughing, but I wondered how he felt.</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> There\u2019s also a line about getting with a girl when Fleabag has a boyfriend, and how \u201cthat doesn\u2019t count\u201d. People would leap on that now. I think they made her less cruel for TV.</p> <p><strong>HJD:</strong> I think producers know that people want characters to be \u201ccomplicated\u201d, but ultimately relatable. They\u2019re part of a pile of things you\u2019re meant to like \u2013 your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sally-rooney\">Sally Rooney</a> or whatever. How much you actually relate to those specific characters, I think, is by the by. It\u2019s more how you relate to the group you\u2019re meant to be in.</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> This reminds me of that great New Yorker essay about <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women\">how the phenomenon of Sex and the City became bigger than the show</a>, and so in turn SATC started to live up to those perceptions. With Fleabag, the phenomenon is almost separate to the thing. Nobody is even considering those cruel lines about weight and sexuality. Did seeing the play change your interpretation of it? I got a much stronger sense that it was about the effects of pornography on a generation of young women. That feels like something we were talking about six years ago.</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> That\u2019s what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/21/fleabag-edinburgh-festival-2013-review\">Lyn Gardner says in her original review</a>. Those issues are still massive for teenagers, although the impact of pornography feels like a less vital topic of conversation now.</p> <p><strong>HJD:</strong> And we\u2019re post-#MeToo. If she were to write it now, you might consider the job interview scene [in which she accidentally lifts her top up during an interview with someone accused of groping] differently.</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> And <em>her</em> lack of boundaries \u2013 the issue of a woman taking advantage.</p> <p><strong>HJD: </strong>I wonder how much of a creative or commercial decision it was to do the play again?</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> What she\u2019s getting out of this \u2013 I like interviewing musicians at the end of a tour, two years after they\u2019ve released an album and they know the limitations of the work and it no longer feels like them. I want to hear her do a proper postmortem. Do you think Fleabag is feminist?</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> I think she is because she has been told that she can do what she wants and she follows that rule. And that does come from a place of privilege. And her attitude to sex is so honest. Actually, I\u2019m not sure.</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> I don\u2019t know. Her porn habits \u2013 gangbang, teens \u2013 probably aren\u2019t ethical, and she\u2019s relentlessly cruel. I think her moral and psychological compass exploded after her mum and best friend died. She\u2019s not even at a point where she\u2019s grasping for values. She\u2019s fulfilling a more immediate need for physical and psychological succour. It\u2019s not until series two that she contemplates what it means to be good.</p> <p><strong>KW: </strong>The play is feminist. Six years ago, it was challenging. Her dad sending her to lectures about feminism, and the speaker asking if they would trade five years of their life for the perfect body \u2013 that tries to defy the ideas of what makes a good feminist. That was definitely exciting then.</p> <p><strong>HJD: </strong>These conversations have moved on, but we still sometimes regress slightly \u2013 look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/28/jameela-jamil-wont-become-double-agent-patriarchy\">Jameela Jamil</a>.</p> <p><strong>LS: </strong>Also what complicates that moment is that Waller-Bridge has the perfect body! What happens to this play now?</p> <p><strong>KW: </strong>I\u2019m sure every drama student will do it as a monologue. Which is great, because it adds to the interesting ones for women.</p> <p><strong>HJD: </strong>I wish it would inspire people to do their own thing rather than just doing what is on trend. It becomes a mould instead of a prompt to think, \u201cWho am I and what are my experiences?\u201d</p> <p><strong>KW:</strong> The media is to blame \u2013 any play or show featuring a vaguely cynical woman who talks about sex becomes \u201cthe new Fleabag\u201d. We need more inventive ways of writing about those people because I\u2019m very happy to see 15 more plays that are about horny, angry women.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/shows/fleabag-wyndhams-theatre/\">Fleabag is at Wyndham\u2019s Theatre, London</a>, until 12 September.

With Fleabag, the phenomenon is almost separate to the thing. Nobody is even considering those cruel lines about weight and sexuality. Did seeing the play change your interpretation of it? I got a much stronger sense that it was about the effects of pornography on a generation of young women. That feels like something we were talking about six years ago. KW: That\u2019s what Lyn Gardner says in her original review. Those issues are still massive for teenagers, although the impact of pornography feels like a less vital topic of conversation now. HJD: And we\u2019re post-#MeToo. If she were to write it now, you might consider the job interview scene [in which she accidentally lifts her top up during an interview with someone accused of groping] differently. LS: And her lack of boundaries \u2013 the issue of a woman taking advantage. HJD: I wonder how much of a creative or commercial decision it was to do the play again? LS: What she\u2019s getting out of this \u2013 I like interviewing musicians at the end of a tour, two years after they\u2019ve released an album and they know the limitations of the work and it no longer feels like them. I want to hear her do a proper postmortem. Do you think Fleabag is feminist? KW: I think she is because she has been told that she can do what she wants and she follows that rule. And that does come from a place of privilege. And her attitude to sex is so honest. Actually, I\u2019m not sure. LS: I don\u2019t know. Her porn habits \u2013 gangbang, teens \u2013 probably aren\u2019t ethical, and she\u2019s relentlessly cruel. I think her moral and psychological compass exploded after her mum and best friend died. She\u2019s not even at a point where she\u2019s grasping for values. She\u2019s fulfilling a more immediate need for physical and psychological succour. It\u2019s not until series two that she contemplates what it means to be good. KW: The play is feminist. Six years ago, it was challenging. Her dad sending her to lectures about feminism, and the speaker asking if they would trade five years of their life for the perfect body \u2013 that tries to defy the ideas of what makes a good feminist. That was definitely exciting then. HJD: These conversations have moved on, but we still sometimes regress slightly \u2013 look at Jameela Jamil. LS: Also what complicates that moment is that Waller-Bridge has the perfect body! What happens to this play now? KW: I\u2019m sure every drama student will do it as a monologue. Which is great, because it adds to the interesting ones for women. HJD: I wish it would inspire people to do their own thing rather than just doing what is on trend. It becomes a mould instead of a prompt to think, \u201cWho am I and what are my experiences?\u201d KW: The media is to blame \u2013 any play or show featuring a vaguely cynical woman who talks about sex becomes \u201cthe new Fleabag\u201d. We need more inventive ways of writing about those people because I\u2019m very happy to see 15 more plays that are about horny, angry women. Fleabag is at Wyndham\u2019s Theatre, London, until 12 September. It will be broadcast in cinemas on 12 September",

      "bodyText": "The Western Australian Labor government says it will back the federal government\u2019s 2030 climate targets, rejecting attempts by the state\u2019s Environmental Protection Authority to introduce tougher measures for new major projects. Proponents of major projects will be given the freedom to propose their own timelines for cutting carbon emissions as well as setting their own targets. The WA energy minister, Bill Johnston, said the state would have an \u201caspirational\u201d target of net zero emissions by 2050. He said WA acknowledged the federal government\u2019s 26%-28% reduction target by 2030 and would commit to \u201cworking with the commonwealth to achieve this goal\u201d. The policy announcement, made in parliament on Wednesday, has been welcomed by the state\u2019s gas industry, which has been the main driver of Australia\u2019s rising emissions. But environment groups see it as another preemptive strike on the WA EPA, which has been consulting on new guidelines for greenhouse gas emissions. Submissions as part of that process close on Monday. A spokeswoman for Woodside Energy said the government had \u201clistened to industry\u201d and \u201ctaken an important step toward providing certainty\u201d for major investments. She said the WA EPA \u201cmust take the same approach as it consults on its proposed new guidelines on greenhouse gas emissions\u201d. The state government\u2019s position puts it at odds with federal Labor, which wanted to strengthen Australia\u2019s emissions target to 45% if it had won the May election. The WA EPA\u2019s original proposal for the state, published in March, was that developers of new or expanded major projects would be required to offset all direct emissions associated with the project. At the time, it said it wanted to set a \u201chigher bar\u201d for assessing the impacts of major projects on climate because a lack of federal policy meant Australia was not on track to meet its obligations under the Paris agreement. But the EPA withdrew the guideline and opened up further consultation with industry after an outcry from gas companies and following a call from the state\u2019s premier, Mark McGowan. McGowan denied he had put pressure on the independent body. The director of the Australia Institute\u2019s climate and energy program, Richie Merzian, said the timing of Wednesday\u2019s announcement looked like another attempt to override the EPA before it had had a chance to consider submissions from the fresh round of consultation. \u201cAt the behest of the WA government, it\u2019s revisited and consulted on this policy and before it can even report back to the minister for the environment, the minister for mines comes back with carte blanche for the gas companies,\u201d Merzian said. Merzian said while the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 was a \u201csilver lining\u201d, that target was still aspirational and \u201cthere\u2019s no interim target and it\u2019s not clear what they actually expect from these major emitters\u201d. \u201cWhat is clear is Australia can\u2019t afford to allow such huge projects to continue to pollute with no limit,\u201d he said. The director of the Conservation Council of WA, Piers Verstegen, said a target of net zero emissions by 2050 was welcome, but the government also had to deliver \u201cimmediate reductions\u201d rather than increases in WA\u2019s carbon pollution. \u201cAt present, WA is the only state with rising pollution.

      "bodyText": "The former Labor senator Sam Dastyari said he advised NSW Labor boss Kaila Murnain to \u201ccover your arse\u201d when she told him of potential fundraising misconduct and mentioned the name of Chinese billionaire and banned donor, Huang Xiangmo. Murnain broke down on Thursday morning while explaining to the Independent Commission Against Corruption that she kept quiet about potentially illegal donations because she was \u201cscared\u201d for the \u201creputation of the party\u201d. Murnain called Dastyari for advice after learning of the potentially unlawful donations in September 2016, and the then senator picked her up in his car. At the time of the meeting with Murnain, Dastyari was in the middle of his own scandal involving Huang\u2019s Yuhu Group, which had forced him from the federal frontbench eight days earlier. In evidence on Thursday morning, Dastyari said Murnain had told him the Labor fundraising accounts were \u201cnot reflective\u201d of what had actually occurred. She had \u201cspecifically singled out\u201d Huang \u2013 banned from donating in NSW due to his property development links \u2013 as someone she was worried about. Dastyari said he urged Murnain, then Labor\u2019s assistant secretary, to go to the party\u2019s lawyers, which he thought was the most appropriate course of action. \u201cI could understand the enormity of it because of how distressed she was,\u201d Dastyari said. A transcript of Dastyari\u2019s earlier evidence to Icac investigators shows he said: \u201cmy advice to her would have been, cover your arse\u201d, by talking to Labor\u2019s lawyers. Dastyari said he had not spoken to anyone else since about the matter, including the federal Labor president. \u201cI had no discussions with nobody about this matter in any shape or form,\u201d he said. Following his evidence, Dastyari told reporters that the current hearings showed the need for a federal integrity commission. He said Labor should not be above reproach. \u201cMy message to the NSW Labor party is: enough\u2019s enough, maybe it\u2019s time to have a serious look at a proper, full statewide ban on private donations,\u201d he said. Murnain was removed overnight from her role as NSW Labor\u2019s general secretary following explosive evidence to Icac on Wednesday that she knew as early as 2016 that Labor had likely taken unlawful donations. Icac has heard that Huang \u2013 a Chinese billionaire, property developer and banned donor \u2013 gave $100,000 in cash to the party in 2015, but that the origins of the donation may have been masked by a series of straw donors. Murnain struggled to hold back tears on Thursday as she explained why she had helped to keep revelations about potentially illegal donations quiet after state Labor MP, Ernest Wong, told her about them in September 2016. Acting on the advice of Dastyari, Murnain said she went to Labor\u2019s lawyers, who told her: \u201cDon\u2019t record this meeting. Don\u2019t put it in your diary. Forget the conversation happened with Ernest \u2026 and don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Murnain said she had followed the advice closely because she was \u201cscared\u201d. Asked why she was scared, Murnain responded: \u201cFor the Labor party, we had been through a lot that year,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were multiple court cases, there were byelections coming. I was scared for the head office and the reputation of the party.\u201d When she first appeared on Thursday morning, Murnain was asked to confirm she had been suspended as Labor general secretary overnight. Murnain said she had found out about the suspension \u201cin the media\u201d. A letter had been sent to her lawyers about the suspension, but she had only read it briefly, the inquiry heard. Evidence to the Icac has claimed Huang visited the Labor party\u2019s Sussex Street headquarters in April 2015 with an Aldi bag filled with $100,000. Official Labor records suggested the $100,000 came from 20 donations of $5,000, made by 12 donors at a Chinese Friends of Labor fundraising dinner several weeks earlier. Two of the donors have now told Icac that they did not make $5,000 donations to Labor. The NSW Electoral Commission first investigated the discrepancies and sought evidence from Murnain and Labor about who had brought the $100,000 into Labor\u2019s headquarters. Murnain said the money had been brought in by Kenrick Cheah, a Labor staffer. She conceded on Thursday that this evidence was \u201cincorrect\u201d, but said she hadn\u2019t deliberately attempted to mislead investigators. She said the answer should have been either former NSW Labor boss, Jamie Clements, or Huang. \u201cI would answer the question very differently now, looking at it,\u201d Murnain said. Murnain said she had recused herself from involvement with the matter when the NSW Electoral Commission issued Labor with a notice to produce documents. She said she hadn\u2019t wanted to interfere with the investigation. But Icac chief commissioner, Peter Hall, said that only Murnain had knowledge of what Wong had told her about the potentially illegal donations. She had also known that the NSW Electoral Commission was seeking precisely that type of information. \u201cWasn\u2019t that a deliberate decision by you to not involve yourself, and not involve the others, by giving them the information you had, so that the true story wouldn\u2019t come out?\u201d Hall asked. Murnain responded: \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t the intent.\u201d Hall also asked Murnain why she hadn\u2019t gone back to Labor\u2019s lawyers when the NSW Electoral Commission intensified its investigations. Murnain said: \u201cI was told to forget it, and that\u2019s what I did.\u201d Dastyari, who was forced out of parliament over his interactions with Huang, spoke to reporters on arriving at the Icac, saying he felt sorry for Murnain and had always given her frank and fearless advice. Dastyari said he hoped the inquiry showed the \u201cinsidious\u201d nature of donations and would start a \u201cnew page\u201d for Labor. Asked why he was giving evidence, Dastyari responded: \u201cI spent a lifetime running towards cameras. I\u2019m not about to run away from them now.\u201d Murnain is expected to be recalled for possible cross-examination next week. Dastyari\u2019s evidence to the inquiry continues.",

This was Williams\u2019 949th career tour-level match compared to McNally\u2019s 10th. This year marks Williams\u2019 20th US Open, while it was McNally\u2019s first. In total, the youngster had previously only competed in the main draw of five top-level events.</p> <p>No matter. McNally was ready and she arrived with a game that seemed forged by the memory of some of the players Williams used to face 20 years ago. She disrupted Williams\u2019 game with her backhand slice that skidded low into the cement, her heavy topspin forehand and her insatiable desire to constantly move forward to the net. Most importantly, the young American, who would watch Williams play as a youngster at her home tournament in Cincinnati, matched Williams\u2019 serving throughout.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I went out there, I just worried about myself,\u201d McNally said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think who was on the other side of the net as much. But obviously I knew I was playing against the greatest of all time. I knew that I had to bring a certain level.\u201d</p> <p>At 5-all, Williams\u2019s groundstrokes began to splutter, and it was all the encouragement McNally needed as she broke serve with a searing forehand return. When the 23-time major champion raced to triple break point in the following game, McNally methodically saved all three with a lethal mixture of potent serving and deft touch, confidently capturing the set.</p> <p>It has been a difficult year for Williams with countless injuries and setbacks. She did not return to the scene of most of her greatest on-court traumas to lose in the second round. Williams despaired for a while, but then she fought and roared into action, elevating her game as she so often does. \u2018</p> <p>\u201cI had to stop making errors,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI made so many errors in the first two sets. It was just too many. You can\u2019t win tournaments making that many errors. I knew I had to play better, and I knew I could.\u201d</p> <p>By the final set, the 37-year-old was in full flow. Williams broke serve immediately with a piercing return, then the youngster gave up the second break with a double fault, the pressure of Williams\u2019 return suffocating her. Finally, the six-time US Open champion sealed the match with a forehand return winner to march on.</p> <p>McNally was not born when Williams captured her first grand slam title 20 years ago at Flushing Meadows, but after watching Williams for her entire life, she was unsurprised by the authority with which she slammed the door shut.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched her so many times,\u201d McNally saud. \u201cI know how well she can play. I was just really impressed with the way she was serving towards the end of the match, how well she was returning. Hats off to her, she just played really well.\u201d</p> <p>McNally will experience the biggest stages many more times as her career progresses, but she will always remember the experience of staring down Serena Williams as a 17-year-old ingenue and leaving with a set and her respect. Unsurprisingly, it has provided ample motivation.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, I think it just shows that I\u2019m capable of playing with the best,\u201d she said. \u201cI got a set off Serena Williams. Had her close in the second set, too. Had some chances. For me, it just gives me a lot of confidence, shows me that I can compete out on the biggest stages. Just keep my head down, I\u2019m ready to go back to work. \u201c</p> <p>For Williams, though the battle brought frustration and despair in the moment, she appreciated the long road that lay ahead to a possible record-tying 24th slam. Any match that hardens her battle instincts and prepares her for the challenges ahead is an asset. Any moment that reminds her just how desperately she wants to win this title is to be cherished.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great because I want to be able to win matches where I\u2019m not playing my best, play players who are playing great, be able to come through. I need to be tested, I guess,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Then Williams rolled her eyes. \u201cSounds scripted. Actually, I\u2019d rather not be tested in every match. But that doesn\u2019t happen, so it\u2019s important for me to have those, like, really rough, rowdy matches. That helps a lot.\u201d</p>",

He credits John Coltrane to becoming an artist. \u201cWhen I was 25, I saw Coltrane live 20 times,\u201d he said. \u201cI was excited by the idea that you could do a tune so many ways and it was still the same tune.

Day, a tiny woman in activewear and a bright pink jacket, was escorted through the corridor of the police station by three bulky officers. She cried at the charge counter while being logged in to custody and was stripped of her jacket and shoes, both of which contained cords that could be considered a ligature risk. In cell No 1, a small beige room with a hard bench and metal toilet, she was made to stand up while police laid down a blanket and couch cushions as a makeshift bed. She was unsteady on her feet, holding the hand of one police officer while a female officer patted her down. Two other police were watching from the doorway. All were wearing disposable gloves. Day was upset to be in custody, says senior constable Matthew Fitzgibbon, but that was not unusual. \u201cNo one is happy to be in a cell,\u201d he said. She was not aggressive or belligerent. \u201cHer demeanour was fine,\u201d Fitzgibbon told Catherine Fitzgerald, the counsel assisting coroner Caitlin English. \u201cShe was never aggressive towards police.\u201d The footage is the first to clearly show Day on the day of her arrest. She was arrested for being drunk in public on a V/Line train to Melbourne, after a conductor called for police assistance for an \u201cunruly\u201d asleep passenger. Earlier footage showed Day on the train station platform with police officers Stephen Thomas and Aaron Towns, who took her off the train. Fitzgibbon and his partner, Kristian Hurford, were working the afternoon shift at Castlemaine that night to cover local officers who were attending their Christmas party. They arrived at the train station as the train was pulling out and joined Day and the other officers on the platform. Hurford called Day\u2019s daughter, Kimberley Watson, and told her what had happened. Watson was unable to drive from Melbourne to collect her but said she would try to find someone. Fitzgibbon said Hurford asked Watson if Day had any medical issues or medication and \u201cas far as I am aware, nothing was disclosed\u201d. Hurford\u2019s statement said he told Watson that Day would be taken back to the station \u201cas per our procedure for any drunk\u201d and would be there for four hours. None of the police can state the origin of the four-hour rule. Peter Morrisey, counsel for the Day family, suggested police had already decided to take Day in custody before Watson was called. Fitzgibbon told Fitzgerald that he did not, at that time, give consideration to calling an ambulance because \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it was required\u201d. Thomas and Towns gave the same evidence, despite being shown police procedures that recommend seeking medical treatment for intoxicated people who present as \u201cconfused.\u201d Fitzgibbon and his partner took Day back to the police station in the back of the divisional van. Once at the station, Fitzgibbon said, he called the Aboriginal Community Justice Partnership (ACJP) to notify them that an Aboriginal person had been taken into custody, and ask if they could send someone to collect her. He spoke to a person named Sandy. \u201cSandy told me that Day was not known to her and she was not prepared to send one of her staff to collect her,\u201d he said. Fitzgibbon had been made a police Aboriginal liaison officer the week before.

Response from authorities Queensland\u2019s minister for disability services, Coralee O\u2019Rourke, told Guardian Australia she shared the concerns of the ombudsman about Adrian\u2019s case and that the recommendations were under review. \u201cI am advised that over the past 12 months the FDS has put strategies in place to encourage and enable this client to participate safely in activities outside his rooms to reduce his seclusion and support his rehabilitation,\u201d she said. O\u2019Rourke said the use of police dogs in the facility was an \u201coperational matter for the Queensland police service\u201d and had been referred to the police commissioner. She said there were already reforms underway to build staffing capacity and hand more powers to the director of forensic disability, who oversees the system. A search was also underway for a new director and a new administrator of the FDS had also been appointed. A spokeswoman for the department said it \u201cacknowledges the ombudsman\u2019s concerns about the seclusion of a client\u201d. \u201cA series of independent clinicians, the mental health court and reviews by the mental health review tribunal have confirmed the ongoing need for detainment due to the risk this client presents to himself and others,\u201d she said.",

As soon as those talks ran into dead lock, China turned around and resumed oil imports from Iran.\u201d</p> <p>Efforts to evade the sanctions have so far been limited, Vaez and other analysts watching the issue closely say the messaging is clear: China \u201ccan make or break the US maximum pressure policy\u201d.</p> <p>China\u2019s change of tack in turn prompted fresh US sanctions in July targeting the Chinese crude oil importer Zhuhai Zhenrong, which accounts for more than 60% of China\u2019s trade with Iran, for \u201cviolating US law by accepting crude oil\u201d.</p> <p>Vaez notes, however, that access to Iranian oil is not simply a question of leverage for China, but reflects its long-term strategic aim not to be complicit in US moves it fears may lead to regime change in Iran.</p> <p>\u201cChina has a complex calculation regarding Iran. It is the only oil-rich country where the US does not have a foothold. From the point of view of China\u2019s energy needs, Iran is very important,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the other hand China has bigger fish to fry with the US with trade negotiations and it needs to balance relations with other oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia.\u201d</p> <p>Sanam Vakil, a senior researcher at Chatham House, believes the subterfuges currently involved reflect a desire by both China and Iran to avoid an overt confrontation over the issue, as Tehran becomes ever more \u201ccreative\u201d about its oil exports.</p> <p>For Vakil, one of the key takeaways has been the Trump administration\u2019s inability to manage the overlapping crises it has fuelled. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for US foreign policy that it has so many interconnected crises. It\u2019s impossible for the US government to meet all of of its objectives,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Vaez echoes the sentiment, adding that Chinese imports of Iranian oil may also have discreet support in European capitals still committed to keeping the Iran nuclear deal alive despite Washington\u2019s unilateral withdrawal.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure the Trump administration has the bandwidth or the strategic understanding to connect all these dots. That\u2019s why its been own worst enemy. Too many of its main files, including North Korea and Iran, are dependent on how the Trump administration treats China.</p> <p>\u201cIn practice, however, this is an administration which, when offered the opportunity to fight too many fires at same time, will jump at it.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s that simple.\u201d The case of the Pacific Bravo, which the US had flagged up as a suspected sanctions breaker, is doubly intriguing. After its unique tracker identifying number disappeared, it reappeared more than a month later attached to a ship listed with a different name, changed in an apparently clumsy effort to disguise it. Other Chinese-owned tankers, several of which are owned by the Bank of Kunlun according to media reports and evidence from tracking companies, have used different tactics. Some have been captured on satellite images interacting with Iranian ships. The events unfolding on the maritime trade routes point to a wider story, of the increasingly complex convergence of two of the Trump administration\u2019s most pressing foreign policy concerns. While Washington seeks to block Iranian oil exports as part of a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign to force Tehran to negotiate over its nuclear and security policies, China \u2013 which is locked in its own escalating trade war with the US \u2013 appears to be throwing Iran a significant lifeline. Iran for its part has encouraged China. The country\u2019s first vice-president, Eshaq Jahangiri, told a visiting Chinese official recently that Tehran expected Beijing to be more active in buying Iranian oil. \u201cI think the two issues have been converging for a while,\u201d Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst with the thinktank Crisis Group said.. . \u201cThe main reason that China initially complied with the US \u2026 policy and significantly reduced oil imports from Iran was because it hoped it could be a card that bore some dividends in the trade negotiations. As soon as those talks ran into dead lock, China turned around and resumed oil imports from Iran.\u201d Efforts to evade the sanctions have so far been limited, Vaez and other analysts watching the issue closely say the messaging is clear: China \u201ccan make or break the US maximum pressure policy\u201d. China\u2019s change of tack in turn prompted fresh US sanctions in July targeting the Chinese crude oil importer Zhuhai Zhenrong, which accounts for more than 60% of China\u2019s trade with Iran, for \u201cviolating US law by accepting crude oil\u201d. Vaez notes, however, that access to Iranian oil is not simply a question of leverage for China, but reflects its long-term strategic aim not to be complicit in US moves it fears may lead to regime change in Iran. \u201cChina has a complex calculation regarding Iran. It is the only oil-rich country where the US does not have a foothold. From the point of view of China\u2019s energy needs, Iran is very important,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the other hand China has bigger fish to fry with the US with trade negotiations and it needs to balance relations with other oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia.\u201d Sanam Vakil, a senior researcher at Chatham House, believes the subterfuges currently involved reflect a desire by both China and Iran to avoid an overt confrontation over the issue, as Tehran becomes ever more \u201ccreative\u201d about its oil exports. For Vakil, one of the key takeaways has been the Trump administration\u2019s inability to manage the overlapping crises it has fuelled. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for US foreign policy that it has so many interconnected crises. It\u2019s impossible for the US government to meet all of of its objectives,\u201d she said. Vaez echoes the sentiment, adding that Chinese imports of Iranian oil may also have discreet support in European capitals still committed to keeping the Iran nuclear deal alive despite Washington\u2019s unilateral withdrawal. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the Trump administration has the bandwidth or the strategic understanding to connect all these dots. That\u2019s why its been own worst enemy. Too many of its main files, including North Korea and Iran, are dependent on how the Trump administration treats China. \u201cIn practice, however, this is an administration which, when offered the opportunity to fight too many fires at same time, will jump at it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There is plenty of constitutional outcry on the front pages of the British papers today, which all lead with Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament ahead of the looming Brexit deadline. Front pages from abroad show the international press is transfixed too. The Guardian says there is \u201cOutrage as Johnson suspends parliament\u201d. The paper leads with John Bercow\u2019s comments that the decision was a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d and the paper\u2019s leader says: \u201cJohnson\u2019s move represents a grotesque abuse of the country\u2019s highest office\u201d. The i has a similar headline: \u201cMPs outraged as Johnson shuts down parliament\u201d but also teases an opinion piece on its front page that calls Johnson\u2019s decision a \u201cBold move [that] will divide the Conservative opposition\u201d. According to the Mail\u2019s telling, it was not the prime minister but Jeremy Corbyn who sparked \u201cfury\u201d by demanding a meeting with the Queen. The paper is far more positive about Johnson\u2019s decision, calling it a \u201chistoric move \u2026 to thwart anti-Brexit MPs\u201d. The FT focuses in on the implications for the constitution: \u201cBoris Johnson sparked constitutional uproar yesterday\u201d, says the paper. Bercow\u2019s \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d comments are prominently featured. The Times\u2019 front page features a large, flattering black and white photo of the prime minister under the headline \u201cJohnson goes for broke\u201d. While it leads with the fact that the news has \u201cpushed Britain to the brink of a constitutional crisis\u201d, it also features a front page sketch in which it mocks Speaker John Bercow who challenged the constitutionality of Johnson\u2019s decision. \u201cJohn Bercow, Speaker of the Commons, was on his family holiday yesterday when he heard of Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation plans,\u201d writes Quentin Letts. \u201cHow did it go down? Let\u2019s just say you would not have wanted your new sandcastle anywhere in Mr Bercow\u2019s orbit in those moments after he heard the news. He might have stamped up and down on it in a tantrum.\u201d The Telegraph, which employed Boris Johnson as a columnist, is very positive about his decision, leading on Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s accusation that it is \u201cMPs trying to thwart Brexit\u201d \u2013 and not the proroguing PM \u2013who are risking a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d. \u201cJacob Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the Commons, hit back at those who accused Boris Johnson of being undemocratic, reminding them Parliament\u2019s duty was, in the words of the constitutional expert AV Dicey, to \u2018give effect to the will \u2026 of the nation\u2019 \u2013 which had chosen to leave the EU.\u201d The Sun says \u201cBallsy Boris\u201d has \u201ccome out fighting\u201d: \u201cBattling Boris Johnson took the fight to his Remainer enemies yesterday.\u201d The paper also wins the award for best headline: \u201cHey big suspender\u201d. The Express is thrilled with the proroguing, writing: \u201cPM secures approval from Queen to suspend Parliament in bold move to sweep aside MPs hellbent on stopping Britain from leaving the EU\u201d. It attempts a bit of a sleight of hand by suggesting that by granting the suspension, the Queen must be in favour of it, with a picture of Her Majesty captioned: \u201cBoris Johnson has had his move approved by the Queen\u201d.

ABC in Spain says Johnson has \u201cput the Queen into the Brexit war\u201d and Liberation in France says we are seeing a harder and harder Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "The former Wallabies player Israel Folau has said the controversial social media posts that led to his sacking were \u201csubstantially unrelated\u201d to rugby, and the termination of his contract was against the public interest for employees to be able to express religious beliefs in their own time. Folau had his contract terminated by Rugby Australia in May over an Instagram post in which he claimed gay people, among others, were destined for hell. Rugby Australia deemed the post constituted a high level breach of his contract and Folau lost his $4m, four-year contract and several sponsorship deals. The sports star has taken Rugby Australia to court seeking $10m in damages, an apology and reinstatement from RA and his former club the NSW Waratahs. In a statement of claim filed with the federal circuit court this week, Folau\u2019s lawyers defended the posts, stating that since Folau became a born-again Christian in December 2017 his social media posts had almost exclusively been related to \u201ccontent that he believes to be the word of God\u201d because Folau believes he has a mission and duty to spread the word of God. Folau argues the posts were done on his own time and not in the workplace, and were substantively unrelated to rugby union since he became born-again. The statement of claim also said Folau previously said he was not homophobic or bigoted, and did not have a problem with gay people, going as far as to mention he appeared on the front page of the Star Observer, Australia\u2019s longest-running LGBTI publication, and supported the gay rugby union competition, the Bingham Cup. \u201cHe believed it was a loving gesture to share passages from the Bible with others,\u201d the statement of claim states. Folau argues it is against the public interest for a condition of employment in a contract to prohibit an employee from, in their own time, imparting or sharing religious information, provided what they are doing is within the law. Folau has also argued the contract termination represented an \u201cunreasonable\u201d restraint of trade because he cannot play rugby at an international level or for an Australian team in the Super Rugby. The federal circuit court encouraged Folau and Rugby Australia to settle the matter through mediation until December. If mediation fails, then the case will be heard over three to five days in early February 2020.",

In recent weeks, China has issued increasingly severe warnings. The PLA released a propaganda video earlier this month showing armed police and soldiers subduing people in yellow hard hats and black tops, the unofficial uniform of the Hong Kong demonstrators. As concerns about a possible crackdown intensify in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Internet Service Providers Association said on Wednesday it was troubled by reports that the local government might issue an executive order to block selective websites or applications.

The potential cost of completely rehabilitating the mine site would be between $1bn and $2bn, depending on the ultimate size of the mine, the institute\u2019s report estimated. Adani has permission to leave six final voids up to 200m deep. The company said it had comprehensive rehabilitation conditions and would undertake works progressively. Also included are long-known potential subsidies \u2013 $100m for the construction of a public road to the mine site and $30m for an airport. Adani has said it no longer requires the airport. The report also noted the use of corporate tax shield loopholes were common in the mining sector, and that Adani had not paid \u201cany material corporate tax in Australia\u201d despite owning and operating the Abbot Point coal terminal since 2011. \u201cIEEFA has long argued the Adani Carmichael thermal coal mine proposal is unbankable and unviable without subsidies, entirely at odds with the Paris climate agreement and is strategically challenged even before the first coal is produced. \u201cFor a handful of jobs and only a fraction of the royalties that coking coal provides to the Queensland budget, Adani\u2019s thermal coal mine provides the state with so much less than alternative regional renewable energy investments would do.\u201d In its response, Adani said the company had not received special treatment. \u201cWe expect anti-coal activists will continue their attempts to discredit and misrepresent our organisation and operations. We will not be intimidated and will deliver our Carmichael project and the benefits it will bring to regional Queensland communities.\u201d",

Witness K has decided to plead guilty in the ACT magistrates court to one charge of communicating secret information obtained in the course of his duties as an Australian Secret Intelligence Service agent by revealing Australia\u2019s spying on Timor-Leste in 2004 during talks to carve up resources in the Timor Sea. At a directions hearing on Thursday, Witness K\u2019s counsel, Haydn Carmichael, told the court his client had applied for legal aid more than a year ago and might still need funding for his plea and sentencing hearing, including \u201csignificant disbursements\u201d to bring witnesses from overseas and medical evidence. Carmichael explained that with the exception of \u201climited fees\u201d to attend hearings in Canberra, Witness K\u2019s case had been conducted pro bono by himself, Robert Richter and solicitors from Corrs Chambers Westgarth, with some assistance from the Australian government solicitor in applying for legal aid. Carmichael signalled he intended to ask the court to force the ACT Legal Aid chief executive, John Boersig, to explain why the application for aid \u201chas not been resolved at all satisfactorily\u201d. Witness K\u2019s case was \u201ccomplex\u201d, \u201cnovel\u201d \u2013 a first-of-its kind prosecution \u2013 and legal aid was required to facilitate the administration of justice, he said. Carmichael quoted a letter promising that Witness K would have \u201cevery proper opportunity to obtain appropriate funding\u201d and that a decision would be made independent of the commonwealth attorney general. But Carmichael accused Boersig of failing to \u201crespond to facts put to him\u201d in the application, a matter of \u201cgrave concern\u201d. He called for a \u201creal and rational response\u201d explaining ACT Legal Aid\u2019s decision and what help would be available to Witness K. Carmichael warned that refusing legal aid might compromise further hearings and would amount to entering a \u201cparallel universe\u201d of intruding on, rather than facilitating, the interests of justice. Witness K\u2019s case is scheduled to return for a mention on 13 September to see if facts of the case are agreed with the prosecution, before a formal plea and sentencing at a later date. Witness K\u2019s former lawyer, Bernard Collaery, has taken a different path, intending to protest his innocence in the ACT supreme court.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThis doubly punishes Indigenous women, who are not only victims of violence but who also risk removal of their children despite severely limited options to ensure their own safety or that of their children. \u201cIt becomes a revolving door of unsafety,\u201d Cripps said. \u201cThese sectors have long operated as silos. Time and time again the reports show us that, but we don\u2019t seem to overcome it.\u201d Indigenous women and children in remote areas are routinely turned away from refuges and safe houses because they are at capacity, the AHURI report said, which is likely a key factor in the high rates of domestic and family violence-related injury and death amongst Indigenous women. Improving integration between housing, domestic and family violence and child protection services should reduce rates of Indigenous women\u2019s injury and death, as well as rates of Indigenous children\u2019s out-of-home care, the report said. Indigenous women and children are judged and questioned as to whether they are worthy victims deserving of support. \u201cWe approach the issue from a deficit place: this is a bad mother. If only we looked at it from the perspective of giving a mother credit for what she\u2019s provided, for the resilience she\u2019s shown in getting to where she has. We need to honour them, not treat them as blame-worthy,\u201d Cripps said. Housing services should be required to ensure Indigenous women in imminent danger of serious injury or death have appropriate options for safe, affordable accommodation, regardless of their housing history, the authors said. From 2012 to 2014, two in five Indigenous homicide victims (41%) were killed by a current or previous partner, twice the rate of non-Indigenous victims. Indigenous women were 32 times as likely to be hospitalised due to domestic and family violence as non-Indigenous women. \u201cAt least a dozen inquiries into domestic violence in the last 20 years have said that you need a focused, holistic response that addresses [the] issue for women, men, children and anybody else in the household who is affected by the violence,\u201d Cripps said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a holistic response, we repeat the cycle, we don\u2019t solve it.\u201d",

A 28-year-old Rohingya refugee Haroon Rashid, who is married to a local woman with whom he has two children, has had his weekly allowances and food rations stopped since June this year. Rashid, who has been in Papua New Guinea for six years, said it had been two months since his rations and payments were cut and he was struggling to provide for his small family with no money or employment. Rashid said his weekly 100 kina (AU$44) allowance was stopped with no explanation. \u201cUsually we\u2019d get 100 kina allowances every Friday of the week.

Refugees who are in Port Moresby seeking medical treatment have also reported having their allowances stopped. A refugee, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Guardian Australia that himself and close to 100 others living in a hotel in the capital had been affected. He said his 100 kina weekly allowances stopped in May this year when he was brought over from Manus Island for medical treatment. \u201cI asked them why and they said, because you are here for medical reasons we won\u2019t pay you.\u201d Refugees seeking medical treatment in Port Moresby said they now had to sell their daily food rations in order to pay for their expenses. Meanwhile, the remaining 120 refugees on Manus Island are being given the opportunity to relocate to Bomana in Port Moresby with the promise of residential accommodation, a one-off financial relocation support payment as well as a weekly allowance. In a recent statement, Petrus Thomas, the Papua New Guinea minister for immigration and border security, said: \u201cSignificant progress has been made towards delivering on prime minister James Marape\u2019s commitment to end regional processing in Manus through the relocation to Port Moresby for refugees.\u201d Thomas said \u201cmany refugees have already expressed interest in the relocation and arrangements to facilitate their transfer are in progress\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened: Kirsten Gillibrand announced she\u2019s dropping out of the 2020 race. Florida declared a state of emergency as hurricane Dorian headed toward the state\u2019s eastern coast. A Trump administration policy alert said that some children of service members and government employees born overseas would no longer qualify for automatic citizenship. Congress will investigate Trump\u2019s pitch to hold next year\u2019s G7 at one of his own resorts. Trump denied reports that he has offered pardons to aides if they break the law to have his border wall built before Election Day. Democratic presidential candidates severely criticized Trump for mocking Puerto Rico and its officials as the island braces for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian, which has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. Senator Johnny Isakson\u2019s retirement announcement means that both of Georgia\u2019s senate seats will be on the 2020 ballot. After Stacy Abrams reiterated that she (still) won\u2019t be running for Senate, the position remains open to a new democratic front runner. It\u2019s also unclear who will be running from the Republican side after Nick Ayers announced he won\u2019t enter the race. The third Democratic debate will likely be a one-night event given that only 10 candidates have made the cut so far, and the qualification deadline is the end of today. Two new polls showed Joe Biden maintaining a double-digit lead over his fellow Democratic presidential candidates. The results indicate that a Monmouth University poll released earlier this week, which showed a three-way tie, was likely an outlier. Republican senator Jonny Isakson\u2019s retirement announcement gives Georgia democrats a new opening. After Stacy Abrams reiterated that she (still) won\u2019t be running for Senate, the position remains open to a new democratic front runner. From the AP: The November 2020 ballot in Georgia will now include a special election for the remaining two years of Isakson\u2019s term in addition to Perdue\u2019s race for another six-year term. It\u2019s a doubly tantalizing target for Democrats who increasingly believe that Georgia, which has become less rural and less white in recent decades, stands on the verge of becoming a swing state after roughly two decades of leaning solidly Republican. \u201cGeorgia is going to be a major decision maker in the reelection of Donald Trump and control of the U.S. Senate now,\u201d said Brian Robinson, a Republican political adviser in Georgia who served as communications director under former Gov. Nathan Deal. It\u2019s an uphill battle for Georgia Democrats, who haven\u2019t elected a governor or U.S. senator since 1998. Bill Clinton was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win here, in 1992. \u201cI am leaving a job I love because my health challenges are taking their toll on me, my family and my staff. My Parkinson\u2019s has been progressing, and I am continuing physical therapy to recover from a fall in July,\u201d the 74-year-old senator said in a statement earlier today. Florida\u2019s governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency, as hurricane Dorian strengthens along a path toward the US mainland. The Category 1 hurricane could grow into a dangerous Category 3, according to the National Hurricane Center as it swirls away from the northern Carribean and toward the western Atlantic. \u201cAll Floridians on the East Coast should have 7 days of supplies, prepare their homes &amp; follow the track closely,\u201d DeSantis said. Earlier today, the storm hit the US Virgin Islands and parts of Puerto Rico, though the main island was spared a direct hit. And here\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s response to news the Gillibrand, who, in her first major speech as a presidential candidate stood outside the Trump hotel and called him a coward, is dropping out of the presidential race. Several of the remaining democratic presidential candidates have responded to Gillibrand\u2019s news, praising the New York senator\u2019s record on women\u2019s rights. In a memo, Gillibrand\u2019s campaign announced that the senator announced that she will relaunch her Off the Sidelines PAC, with the goal of raising and investing at least $1 million to elect women in 2020. But \u201cregardless of who wins the Democratic nomination for president, Kirsten is 100% committed to doing what she can to beat Donald Trump,\u201d her campaign said in a statement. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services has issued a clarification, indicating that most military kids born overseas wouldn\u2019t lose the right to automatic citizenship at birth. It gets pretty technical, but basically, it seems that the new policy will not affect the kids of troops or government employees if one or both parents are US citizens with residency in the US. But it could impact kids adopted by overseas services members after birth, and kids born to government employees or service members who aren\u2019t citizens. It\u2019s unclear how many children would be affected. One key point: This policy is about the right to automatic citizenship. The kids of US troops or government employees that fall into that second category can still apply for naturalization like others born outside the US to American parents. Basically, the new policy doesn\u2019t affect all kids of troops and government workers overseas \u2014 but it does make it more complicated for some to become citizens. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said she will withdraw from the democratic presidential race, after failing to qualify for the third debate next month. \u201cI am so proud of this team and all we\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to know how you can best serve.\u201d Gillibrand centered her candidacy on women\u2019s equality, vowing to only nominate supreme court judges who support women\u2019s reproductive rights and held raillies in conservative states where abortion rights were under threat. But her campaign struggled from the start to gain traction. The New York Times reports: Ms. Gillibrand said in an interview that she would endorse another candidate in the primary but had not yet picked a favorite. Though she stopped short of saying she would endorse a woman, Ms. Gillibrand, who has made electing women to Congress a personal cause, said the next president had to be capable of uniting the country and suggested that a woman might be best suited for the job. \u201cI think that women have a unique ability to bring people together and heal this country,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said, adding, \u201cI think a woman nominee would be inspiring and exciting.\u201d But she added: \u201cI will support whoever the nominee is, and I will do whatever it takes to beat Trump.\u201d The House judiciary committee announced that it will investigate Trump\u2019s proposal to hold next year\u2019s G7 summit at his Miami-area golf resort. While attending this year\u2019s Group of Seven meeting in Biarritz, France, the president suggested holding next year\u2019s event at the Trump National Doral Miami. Trump\u2019s critics pointed out that this would be a blatant conflict of interest and would allow him to profit off the presidency. Trump\u2019s efforts to host the summit at one of his own properties, \u201creflects perhaps the first publicly known instance in which foreign governments would be required to pay President Trump\u2019s private businesses in order to conduct business with the United States\u201d, the House judiciary chairman, Jerrold Nadler, and the civil liberties chair Steve Cohen said in a statement. The judiciary committee is already conducting several other investigations into Trump\u2019s actions, as Congress considers whether to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Trump administration said in a policy alert that children of US service members and government employees born overseas would no longer qualify for automatic citizenship. Trump denied reports that he has offered pardons to aides if they break the law to have his border wall built before Election Day. Democratic presidential candidates severely criticized Trump for mocking Puerto Rico and its officials as the island braces for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian, which has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. Multiple candidates, including Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Nick Ayers, ruled out the possibility of seeking Johnny Isakson\u2019s Senate seat after the Georgia Republican announced he would resign at the end of the year due to health issues. The third Democratic debate will likely be a one-night event given that only 10 candidates have made the cut so far, and the qualification deadline is the end of today. Two new polls showed Joe Biden maintaining a double-digit lead over his fellow Democratic presidential candidates. The results indicate that a Monmouth University poll released earlier this week, which showed a three-way tie, was likely an outlier. Maanvi will have more on the fallout from Trump\u2019s shocking policy moves and rhetoric, so stay tuned. An NBC News reporter noted that the Trump administration\u2019s new policy, which would keep the children of US service members born overseas from qualifying for automatic citizenship, would have affected a very famous senator. A Defense One correspondent also predicted the policy change would have a negative effect on retention, which the US military has struggled with. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke condemned the move by the Trump administration to no longer allow children of US service members born overseas to qualify for automatic citizenship. Another 2020 Democrat, representative Tim Ryan, called the policy change an \u201cinsult\u201d to members of the military. Children of US service members and government employees who are born overseas will no longer be considered for automatic citizenship, according to a policy alert from US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The military-focused website Task &amp; Purpose reports: Previously, children born to U.S. citizen parents were considered to be \u2018residing in the United States,\u2019 and therefore would be automatically given citizenship under Immigration and Nationality Act 320. Now, children born to U.S. service members and government employees, such as those born in U.S. military hospitals or diplomatic facilities, will not be considered as residing in the U.S., changing the way that they potentially receive citizenship. ... According to USCIS, previous legislation also explicitly said that spouses of service members who were living outside the U.S. because of their spouses were considered residing in the U.S., but \u2018that no similar provision was included for children of U.S. armed forces members in the acquisition of citizenship context is significant.\u2019 That is one of the reasons why USCIS has now decided that those children are not considered to be residing in the U.S., and therefore will not be automatically given citizenship. Instead, they will fall under INA 322, which considers them to be residing outside the U.S. and requires them to apply for naturalization. They will be allowed to complete all naturalization proceedings while living abroad, the new policy says. MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell apologized for sharing a thinly sourced story about the president\u2019s finances on his show last night, promising to address the matter tonight. Based on a single source, O\u2019Donnell reported Trump had received loans from Deutsche Bank that were co-signed by \u201cRussian billionaires close to Vladimir Putin.\u201d O\u2019Donnell himself acknowledged during his program that the story was thinly sourced: \u201cI want to stress that is a single source, that has not been confirmed by NBC News. I have not seen any documentation from Deutsche Bank that supports this and verifies this. This is just a single source who has revealed that to me.\u201d In a letter to NBC, a lawyer for Trump and the Trump Organization demanded an immediate retraction, calling the story \u201cfalse and defamatory, and extremely damaging.\u201d Representative Ilhan Omar shared an image on Twitter of a frighteningly specific death threat that the Minnesota Democrat received. A New York man was arrested earlier this year for allegedly threatening to assault and murder Omar. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign confirmed that it ejected a Breitbart News reporter from a South Carolina event at Benedict College, a historically black university. \u201cBeto for America believes in the right to a free press and works hard to ensure the campaign reflects that,\u201d O\u2019Rourke\u2019s press secretary said in a statement. She continued: \u201cHowever, whether it\u2019s dedicating an entire section of their website to \u2018black crime,\u2019 inferring that immigrants are terrorists, or using derogatory terms to refer to LGBTQ people, Breitbart News walks the line between being news and a perpetrator of hate speech. \u201cGiven this particular Breitbart employee\u2019s previous hateful reporting and the sensitivity of the topics being discussed with students at an HBCU, a campaign staffer made the call to ask him to leave to ensure that the students attending the event felt comfortable and safe while sharing their experiences as young people of color.\u201d The Breitbart reporter, Joel Pollak, previously wrote that an O\u2019Rourke staffer told him \u201cI could either leave voluntarily or be \u2018officially uninvited\u2019 from campus, suggesting arrest.\u201d The account raised alarms among some journalists, who called it \u201ca pretty weak move\u201d on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s part. But others said the campaign\u2019s response was justified given Breitbart\u2019s past coverage. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden harshly criticized Trump for mocking Puerto Rico and its officials as the island braces for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian, which has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. Trump also claimed in that same Twitter thread he was \u201cthe best thing that\u2019s ever happened to Puerto Rico.\u201d Trump has repeatedly claimed a wall along the US-Mexico border, the signature promise of his 2016 campaign, is already under construction. But in reality, the president has fallen far short of his oft-repeated promise to \u201cbuild the wall.\u201d The Washington Post reports: Trump has repeatedly promised to complete 500 miles of fencing by the time voters go to the polls in November 2020, stirring chants of \u2018Finish the Wall!\u2019 at his political rallies as he pushes for tighter border controls. But the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed just about 60 miles of \u2018replacement\u2019 barrier during the first 2\u00bd years of Trump\u2019s presidency, all of it in areas that previously had border infrastructure. The Post\u2019s Fact Checker reported earlier this month that Trump has falsely claimed 190 times that the border wall is being built, making it his most frequently repeated falsehood. In his tweet denying that he has offered pardons to aides if they break the law to get the border wall built, Trump also resuscitated his claim that the Washington Post is serving as a lobbyist for Amazon. The Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. But the newspaper\u2019s executive editor has dismissed the claim that Bezos controls the Post\u2019s coverage as a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders attracted criticism earlier this month for implying that the Post was covering him negatively because the Vermont senator has scrutinized Amazon\u2019s business practices. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris slammed Trump as a \u201clawless president\u201d over the reports that he has promised to pardon aides who break the law to get his promised border wall built before Election Day. The Washington Post has reported that Trump is pushing aides to redirect billions of dollars and seize private land to get the border wall built, out of fear that he will not win re-election if he fails to accomplish his signature campaign promise. The White House initially responded to the report by claiming that Trump was joking, but the president has now flatly denied making the comments. Trump has sent a tweet denying that he offered pardons to aides if they broke the law to get his promised border wall built before Election Day, as the Washington Post reported. But when the Post sought a comment on the story, the White House did not deny Trump had made the comments. An unnamed official instead claimed the president had been joking when he promised the pardons. Interestingly, Trump\u2019s denial comes about an hour after he once again falsely claimed the border wall was already being built. David Valadao, a former Republican congressman, will once again seek his California seat after losing by just 862 votes last year. Valadao said his dismay with the performance of Democratic representative TJ Cox, who narrowly won the seat in 2018, had compelled him to run again. The Republican said in a statement that he \u201ccannot continue to sit silent while TJ Cox pursues a radical liberal agenda that hurts our communities.\u201d The statement added: \u201cThe Central Valley needs a strong voice they can trust representing them in Congress, someone who listens and understands that Central Valley residents just want an opportunity to provide and build a better life for their families.\u201d Cox\u2019s office said in response that he had \u201chit the ground running when he took office in January, and he\u2019s already delivering for the working families of the Central Valley and standing up to Trump\u2019s out of control presidency.\u201d Nick Ayers, the former chief of staff to the vice president, issued a statement taking himself out of the running to replace Johnny Isakson in the Senate. Ayers left the Trump administration at the end of last year, turning down the chance to become the president\u2019s chief of staff. At the time, Ayers said he would return to Georgia to spend more time with his wife and three young children. Isakson, a Republican who has represented Georgia in the Senate since 2005, announced earlier today that he would retire at the end of the year due to mounting health issues. More Democratic presidential candidates are condemning Trump\u2019s plan to redirect hundreds of millions of dollars from Fema\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund to pay for immigrant detention space. Reports of the administration\u2019s move emerged as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands prepared for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian, which has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. Mark Esper, the new secretary of defense, held a rare press briefing at the Pentagon. But Esper assured the (many) reporters gathered there that the Defense Department would resume regular press briefings. Esper\u2019s assurance comes two weeks after it was announced that Alyssa Farah, a former spokesperson for the vice president, would become the Defense Department\u2019s new press secretary. A Washington Post reporter and Iraq War veteran argued that the Pentagon\u2019s lack of briefings in recent months could be read as an insult to US service members. Jason Greenblatt, the Trump administration official who has been helping Jared Kushner try to negotiate an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, confirmed that the proposal will not be released before Israel\u2019s elections on 17 September. During the G7 summit, Trump raised the possibility that the deal would be ready before the elections, telling reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re going to know who the [Israeli] prime minister is going to be fairly soon. ... [A deal] won\u2019t be before the election, I don\u2019t think\u2026 But I think you may see what the deal is before the election. And I think the deal will happen.\u201d There has been intense skepticism about whether the deal will result in any change, given that Palestinian officials have already been extremely critical of Kushner\u2019s approach. Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden, is about to arrive in New York after her zero-carbon crossing of the Atlantic. Joanna Walters has more on the Guardian\u2019s live blog covering Thunberg\u2019s arrival: For the last few hours the yacht she sailed on has been anchored off southern Brooklyn, going through customs and immigration procedures, and \u2018tide allowing\u2019, it\u2019s expected to approach the city past the Statute of Liberty soon. A flotilla of supporters under sail are expected to intercept her near Liberty and escort her to a marina just on the west side of the tip of Manhattan, where the harbor meets the Hudson River. Another House Democrat, Bill Foster of Illinois, has announced his support for launching an impeachment inquiry against Trump. Foster is the 137th House Democrat to back an inquiry, according to Politico\u2019s count, representing more than half of the party\u2019s caucus. But Nancy Pelosi has still appeared skeptical of impeachment, as the House speaker fears it could spark a backlash against Democrats that will carry over into the 2020 congressional races. With Congress set to return to Capitol Hill in less than two weeks, Pelosi will likely soon have to confront the widening gap between Democratic leadership and most of her caucus members. A wooden statue of Trump has popped up in Slovenia, the home country of the first lady, but it\u2019s not necessarily a flattering depiction. The Washington Post reports: A wooden statue, nearly 25 feet tall, has suddenly popped up on private land in the village of Sela pri Kamniku, about 20 miles northeast of the capital, Ljubljana. The president may not like it, though. The statue depicts Trump in a blue suit and a bright red tie, standing with a fierce look in his blue eyes, his right arm raised straight up in the air with a clenched fist. With a square head and jaw, the Trump statue looks almost like a Christmas nutcracker, or maybe a Presidential Pez. It also appears to be a work in progress, with an extension ladder still propped up against the statue\u2019s head Wednesday and scrap lumber piled nearby.... The artist, who was helped in the construction by a group of local young people, said in [a] TV interview that the statue was \u2018a provocation, because the world is full of populism.\u2019 Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said Johnny Isakson\u2019s retirement announcement does not change her own plans on running for the Senate. Abrams said earlier this year that she would not challenge David Perdue, Georgia\u2019s other Republican senator, and she is sticking with her plan not to run for a Senate seat even with the unexpected opening. Abrams also announced earlier this month that she would not enter the Democratic presidential primary, while leaving the door open to becoming the eventual nominee\u2019s running mate. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Georgia emphasized the state\u2019s importance in the 2020 Senate map now that both seats will be up for grabs. \u201cWe thank Senator Isakson for his years of service to his state and country, and wish him all the best for his future,\u201d the party said in a statement. It added: \u201cWith now two Senate seats up for election in 2020, it has never been clearer that the path for Democratic victory runs through Georgia. We are the battleground state, and Georgia Democrats are ready to fight and deliver both the Senate and the presidency for Democrats across the country in 2020.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump has repeatedly attacked Puerto Rico as the island braces for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian, which appears to be strengthening. The president has simultaneously claimed he is \u201cthe best thing that\u2019s ever happened to Puerto Rico.\u201d The third Democratic debate appears to be set at 10 candidates, barring the release of an unexpected poll that puts Tom Steyer over the threshold. That means the September debate will likely be a one-night event. Two polls released this morning showed Joe Biden has maintained a double-digit lead over his fellow Democratic presidential candidates. Trump has promised aides that he will pardon them if they break the law to get the border wall built before Election Day, according to the Washington Post. The blog is still tracking Trump\u2019s Twitter feed so that you don\u2019t have to. Stay tuned. Monmouth University, which put out a poll this week showing a three-way tie in the Democratic presidential primary, released a statement describing the results as \u201can outlier.\u201d Two other polls released this morning showed Joe Biden maintaining a double-digit lead over his primary opponents, a trend that has held steady in recent weeks. Even when Monmouth\u2019s poll was released on Monday, many of Biden\u2019s supporters complained that the sample size was too low to draw conclusions about the state of the race. But despite Monmouth acknowledging that its survey was likely an outlier, at least one pro-Biden pollster is still complaining about the university releasing the numbers. Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican congressman who repeatedly criticized Trump while he was still in office, mocked the president\u2019s comments about Puerto Rico as it prepares for the arrival of a tropical storm. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democratic presidential candidate, also criticized the Trump administration for moving funding away from disaster relief even though Dorian could progress into a Category 3 hurricane by the time it reaches the southeast coast. The White House\u2019s Twitter feed currently demonstrates the striking contrast between the government preparing for Tropical Storm Dorian and Trump focusing his attention on attacking Puerto Rico. The White House has retweeted Trump\u2019s mockery of the island as \u201cone of the most corrupt places on earth\u201d and his boast that he is \u201cthe best thing that\u2019s ever happened to Puerto Rico.\u201d But the account has also reshared FEMA\u2019s advice about what residents of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands should do as they prepare for the storm. Twitter users are reacting to Trump\u2019s comments on Puerto Rico with scorn and mockery as Tropical Storm Dorian approaches the island. A writer for the Atlantic said Trump\u2019s comments demonstrated the need for Puerto Rico to gain statehood. But a Puerto Rican writer argued the comments were sadly in line with how the US territory has historically been treated. Meanwhile, Dorian appears to be strengthening into a hurricane as it approaches Puerto Rico, but it may still miss the island. Trump has once again lashed out against Puerto Rico and its leaders as the island prepares for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian. Describing the US territory as \u201cone of the most corrupt places on earth,\u201d Trump ridiculed Puerto Rican officials and bemoaned the aid sent to the island after Hurricane Maria. Trump concluded, \u201cAnd by the way, I\u2019m the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to Puerto Rico!\u201d Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican of Georgia, intends to resign amid mounting health problems. In a statement announcing his decision, Isakson said his advancing Parkinson\u2019s meant he would \u201cnot be able to do the job over the long term in the manner the citizens of Georgia deserve.\u201d A special election will likely be called to fill the remainder of Isakson\u2019s term, which ends in 2022. Georgia already has one Senate race on the books for next year, as Republican David Perdue seeks re-election. Trump is once again complaining about coverage on his preferred cable network, Fox News. The president continues to shower praise on his preferred Fox hosts, like Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro, but he has recently complained about how much coverage the network is giving to the Democratic presidential primary. He whined last month that Fox \u201cfailed in getting the very BORING Dem debates [and] is now loading up with Democrats.\u201d Jim Mattis, Trump\u2019s former defense secretary, has a new memoir coming out next week in which he details some of his foreign policy differences with the president \u2013 most notably on Nato and torture. Our colleague David Smith reports: The book, Call Sign Chaos, will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. In it, Mattis avoids direct criticism of his former boss but offers some pointed comments that will probably be seized on by opponents of the president. The retired US marine corps general recalls being surprised in November 2016 when he was called by the then vice-president-elect, Mike Pence, and asked to meet Trump to discuss the job of defense secretary. Mattis describes being driven to the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and having an \u2018amiable\u2019 meeting. But, he notes: \u2018I figured that my strong support of Nato and my dismissal of the use of torture on prisoners would have the president-elect looking for another candidate.\u2019 ... Mattis offers a brisk but telling explanation of his departure: \u2018When my concrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with allies, no longer resonated, it was time to resign, despite the limitless joy I felt serving alongside our troops in defense of the constitution.\u2019 Trump has offered some words of support to Boris Johnson, as the newly elected British prime minister tries to force through a no-deal Brexit by giving Parliament a limited amount of time to prevent such an outcome. Our colleagues Jessica Elgot and Heather Stewart have more on the latest from London: Johnson has confirmed he has asked the Queen for permission to suspend parliament for five weeks from early September. The prime minister claimed MPs would have \u2018ample time\u2019 to debate Brexit, as he wrote to MPs on Wednesday, saying he had spoken to the Queen and asked her to suspend parliament from \u2018the second sitting week in September\u2019. MPs will then return to Westminster on 14 October, when he said there would be a new Queen\u2019s speech, setting out what he called a \u2018bold and ambitious domestic legislative agenda for the renewal of our country after Brexit\u2019. The effect of the decision will be to curtail dramatically the time MPs have to introduce legislation or other measures aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit. Parliament is expected to sit for little more than a week from 3 September. Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House adviser, inspired some confusion among Fox News viewers yesterday when she started singing a Taylor Swift song to mock the artist\u2019s criticism of the Trump administration. \u201cI actually like the new Taylor Swift song. It\u2019s called \u2018You Need To Calm Down.\u2019 I can sing it for you, you know, where she says, \u2018If you say it on the street that\u2019s a knockout. If you put it in a tweet that\u2019s a cop-out,\u2019\u201d Conway said. She added, \u201cI love that. That basically is Washington in a nutshell.\u201d But some of Swift\u2019s fans have speculated that the lyric is a dig at the president. While accepting the MTV Video Music Award for best video of the year on Monday, Swift criticized the White House for not supporting the Equality Act, which would prohibit discrimination based on one\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. Trump is urging his aides to get a wall built along the US-Mexico border before Election Day using any means necessary. The president has even assured officials that he will pardon them if they break the law to do so, according to the Washington Post. The Post reports: The president has told senior aides that a failure to deliver on the signature promise of his 2016 campaign would be a letdown to his supporters and an embarrassing defeat. With the election 14 months away and hundreds of miles of fencing plans still in blueprint form, Trump has held regular White House meetings for progress updates and to hasten the pace, according to several people involved in the discussions. When aides have suggested that some orders are illegal or unworkable, Trump has suggested he would pardon the officials if they would just go ahead, aides said. He has waved off worries about contracting procedures and the use of eminent domain, saying \u2018take the land,\u2019 according to officials who attended the meetings. ... Asked for comment, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Trump is joking when he makes such statements about pardons. The polls released this morning also indicate that Joe Biden has maintained a double-digit lead over his fellow Democratic presidential candidates. According to Quinnipiac, Biden has the support of 32 percent of Democratic voters, besting second-place Elizabeth Warren by 13 points. The USA Today/Suffolk University poll also has Biden at 32 percent, with Warren trailing by 18 points. The results indicate that a Monmouth University poll released earlier this week \u2013 which showed Biden, Warren and Bernie Sanders in a three-way tie \u2013 may have been an outlier. But regardless, the three candidates have consistently come out on top in recent polls, as their opponents have struggled to break into that top tier. Two more polls were released this morning that could have helped Democratic presidential candidates qualify for the next debate. But unfortunately for billionaire activist Tom Steyer, the results were not helpful. Steyer only needs one more qualifying poll to participate in the September debate, but the surveys from Quinnipiac University and USA Today/Suffolk University showed him receiving the support of less than 1 percent of Democratic voters. Tulsi Gabbard also failed to hit 2 percent in either survey, and the Hawaii congresswoman needed two more qualifying polls to make the debate stage. Given that this blog does not know of any other polls expected to be released today, the third debate is shaping up to be a one-night event. Ten candidates have qualified so far, and ABC, the network hosting the debate, has said it will only add a second night if 11 or more candidates qualify. Happy Wednesday, live blog readers! Given that it\u2019s a day ending in a y, Donald Trump is up and tweeting at a critic, even though that critic is currently bracing for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian. The US president slammed the \u201cincompetent Mayor of San Juan\u201d while seeming to complain about how Puerto Rico has repeatedly been hit by major storms \u2013 something that the island\u2019s residents certainly would not have chosen either. Trump has repeatedly clashed with San Juan\u2019s mayor, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, but the latest attack may have been sparked by comments that Cruz made to CNN last night. \u201cWe are not going to be concerned by, frankly, his behavior, his lack of understanding, and it is ludicrous,\u201d Cruz said of Trump. \u201cSo get out of the way, President Trump, and let people who can do the job get the job done.\u201d Cruz\u2019s comments came as Trump has appeared tepid about providing support to the island and his administration prepared to pull more than $150 million from FEMA\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund. Coming just two years after thousands of Puerto Ricans died as a result of Hurricane Maria, many are wondering how much more devastation needs to occur for Trump to take this threat seriously. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will receive his intelligence briefing and meet with his interior secretary, David Bernhardt. Democratic presidential candidates have until the end of the day to qualify for the next debate. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota senator and presidential candidate, will hold a press conference on gun violence in Las Vegas. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",
