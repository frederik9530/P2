      "bodyText": "The former environment minister Josh Frydenberg went against the advice of his departmental experts when he blocked two wind turbines on Lord Howe Island in 2017, consigning the world heritage-listed island to relying on diesel fuel for the bulk of its electricity. A freedom of information request by the Guardian has uncovered that the minister took the unusual action of blocking the project under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, deeming it \u201cunacceptable\u201d. It was one of two projects that Frydenberg rejected while environment minister, the other being a nursing home at Sydney\u2019s Middle Head on federal land. Both were criticised by the broadcaster Alan Jones, who particularly campaigned against the Middle Head development. Projects are rarely ruled \u201cunacceptable\u201d under federal environmental laws but are often approved with modifications or strict conditions. For instance, the Adani coal project\u2019s groundwater plan was approved in 2019 with conditions; the Abbot Point coal terminal was judged not to have unacceptable impacts on the Great Barrier Reef; and the Watermark coal project near Tamworth was waved through in 2015. But two medium-sized wind turbines on Lord Howe Island proved a bridge too far for Frydenberg as environment minister. Now the Guardian can reveal that his decision was taken despite the advice of his own department, strong support from the majority of residents on Lord Howe Island, the governing board of the island, and even another federal government agency \u2013 the Australian Renewable Energy Agency \u2013 which had offered $4.6m in funding towards the renewable energy project. The department\u2019s natural heritage section 23 November 2016 advice was that \u201cthe proposed action is unlikely to significantly impact the Island Group\u2019s world heritage values\u201d and that moving the island away from reliance on weekly deliveries of diesel would help secure its Unesco world heritage status. The department went on to say: \u201cThe proposed turbine site was selected because it is in close proximity to the existing powerhouse and electricity network and is one of the least visible cleared pieces of elevated land on the island.\u201d \u201cPractical access and operation considerations limit the turbines\u2019 physical size. The turbines are not permanently fixed but can be lowered for maintenance and other purposes.\u201d It said the proposed turbines were a similar scale to the existing aviation towers near the project site. There was some concern expressed from the migratory birds section of the department about whether the turbines might harm Lord Howes\u2019 bird population. But the final recommendation from the department was that risks could be mitigated by the Lord Howe Island board\u2019s proposal to shut down the turbines at sunset when shearwaters returned to their nests. \u201cThe department considers that impacts on listed migratory birds could potentially be mitigated, for example through development and implementation of the adaptive management approach proposed in the referral,\u201d it said. But having outlined the reasons why the project should be given the go-ahead, the department, perhaps pre-empting the minister\u2019s attitude, advised that he could still oppose it, and included the paperwork for him to do so.

At the time, Jones was regularly railing against windfarm projects, and there was opposition to windfarms within the Coalition. In 2014, the then treasurer, Joe Hockey, called wind turbines \u201cutterly offensive\u201d, while former prime minister Tony Abbott said in 2015 they were \u201c ugly\u201d and \u201cnoisy\u201d. The case raises questions about political influence in environmental decision making. \u201cFormer environment minister Josh Frydenberg\u2019s rejection of the Lord Howe Island windfarm is inconsistent with many other environmental approvals where there was strong departmental advice about unavoidable risks to internationally protected places and wildlife,\u201d Basha Stasak, the Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s nature campaign manager, said. \u201cFor example, Frydenberg ignored clear departmental advice urging a rejection of the Toondah Harbour property development because it would destroy part of an internationally protected wetland. \u201cThese inconsistencies go to the heart of the environmental law reform Australia needs.

A spokesperson for the current environment minister, Sussan Ley, said then minister Frydenberg considered that \u201cthe proposed wind turbines would create a considerable, intrusive visual impact and that this would affect the spectacular and scenic landscapes for which the island group is recognised\u201d. \u201cThe minister concluded that the proposal would be an inappropriate development for Lord Howe Island and that the impacts on the island group\u2019s heritage values could not be sufficiently avoided or mitigated,\u201d she said. The spokesman said the minister had given \u201cthorough consideration to a range of matters\u201d before deciding that the wind turbine proposal would have clearly unacceptable impacts and that the decision did not affect the solar component of the island\u2019s energy project.

As a club we have initiatives and we are very clear where we stand on racist chants at this ground or any other ground. I will reiterate that clearly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Weapons companies and major military contractors are spending tens of thousands wining, dining and giving gifts to defence officials, including during negotiations over multibillion-dollar arms deals. An internal log of gifts, hospitality and sponsorship provided to defence officials shows a steady stream of small gifts from military contractors in the past three years. The gifts range from minor offerings \u2013 branded pens, corporate merchandise, plaques, and food baskets \u2013 to more expensive dinners, cocktail functions and event sponsorships worth more than $10,000. The vast majority of gifts and hospitality were from companies that regularly bid for lucrative work with the defence department. Defence policy deems it inappropriate to take money from companies involved in tender processes, and warns officials to avoid creating actual or perceived conflicts of interest. In one case, Rolls-Royce Australia hosted 18 senior navy officers and defence leaders for a \u201charbour cruise dinner\u201d in October 2017. The cost of the cruise has been kept secret by defence. Rolls-Royce has won tens of millions of dollars in work from defence, according to tender data, and has publicly expressed keen interest in obtaining work through defence\u2019s $35bn SEA 5000 future frigate project. The log also shows Rheinmetall Defence Australia paid for a $150 dinner in mid-2017 with two defence officials to hold \u201ccontract discussions\u201d on the $5.2bn armoured reconnaissance vehicle contract, which it went on to win. In another case, BAE Systems picked up the tab for a \u201cworking dinner\u201d in early 2018 to discuss the major $35bn future frigate contract, which it later won. Other privately funded hospitality events were used to celebrate project milestones. Northrop Grumman paid for a $1,000 cocktail function in mid-2018 to celebrate a milestone on its maritime patrol aircraft project with defence officials. Boeing and Airbus paid $600 for a lunch and sporting activity to celebrate the first year of its contract to sustain the P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft. Major military contractors including Boeing, Rolls-Royce and BAE also struck sponsorship deals for defence conferences and events. The log shows at least five separate sponsorships worth at least $10,000 for defence\u2019s air and sea power conferences, and for a 2018 event marking the 50th anniversary of the P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft. Other gifts were incidental. In June, Raytheon, a big player in navy aviation, booked a table for an Australian Naval Institute oration. But the log suggests the company could not fill the table with \u201ccompany execs\u201d, so instead offered a $110 seat to the head of defence\u2019s navy aviation systems branch. There is no suggestion that any of these gifts directly influenced defence officials or procurement outcomes. Strict rules govern the acceptance of gifts or hospitality, and defence\u2019s policy statement warns its employees to be careful in what they accept. The policy warns that taking hospitality from outside the Commonwealth risks creating the perception of conflict, but is generally defensible if it is used to \u201cgenuinely assist the agency to develop and maintain constructive relationships with stakeholders\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cOfficials, particularly at senior levels, are now much more likely to deal regularly with heads of corporations and senior business representatives, heads of non-government organisations and international officials,\u201d the policy statement reads. \u201cIn many of these sectors, offers of gifts and hospitality are commonplace. \u201cFor defence to carry out its functions fairly, impartially and professionally, however, and for the public to be confident that it will do so, officials must be able to demonstrate that they cannot be improperly influenced in the performance of their duties by offers of gifts or other inducement.\u201d The rules also warn that even small gifts of \u201cminor value\u201d may not be acceptable. \u201cEven token gifts that carry a company\u2019s logo can create, in some circumstances, a perceived conflict of interest,\u201d the rules say.

That register is not publicly available, but was released this week on the department\u2019s freedom of information disclosure log. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, recently announced he would ask departments to begin publishing their gift registers to improve transparency and integrity. The Australian National Audit Office last year recommended an online register of public service gifts, saying it would enhance transparency and could \u201cassist entities in meeting accountability and transparency obligations\u201d. The publication of gift registers already occurs in some states and territories, including Queensland, where departments routinely publish their gift registers to improve transparency and public trust. A spokeswoman for BAE said the company took its responsibilities seriously and was wholly committed to ethical and responsible behaviour.

      "bodyText": "Two-thirds of schools in England have poor fire protection systems and are not properly prepared for a potential blaze, according to an education insurer. Zurich Municipal, which insures about half of all schools and universities in the UK, has written to the government calling for urgent action to improve fire protection in school premises after carrying out inspections at 1,000 sites over the past two years. Zurich said 67% of English schools inspected were rated as having \u201cpoor\u201d fire protection systems and 5% were awarded an \u201cexcellent\u201d rating. In contrast, 29% of Scottish schools were rated as excellent. In Scotland, sprinkler systems are legally required in all new and major refurbished schools. In England, sprinklers are not mandatory in all schools and fewer than one in six new schools have been built with systems installed. In addition to sprinklers, inspectors who carried out school visits also considered building combustibility and modern construction methods, as well as fire detection systems and smoking controls. Zurich said there are more than 1,000 fires in school premises every year, costing on average \u00a32.8m for larger incidents and closing premises not just for pupils but also the wider community, which often uses the space out of school hours. Tilden Watson, the head of education at Zurich, said: \u201cA change in government legislation to make sprinklers in schools mandatory not only protects children while they are in school, it often contains the fire to the room it starts in when it happens out of school hours. \u201cNot only does this minimise the level of damage caused, it also negates the aftermath, which often leads to months or even years of disruption for children\u2019s education while the school is repaired.\u201d Andy Dark, the assistant general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear in the past that newly built schools and other high-risk buildings should have sprinkler systems and we fully support Zurich Municipal\u2019s call on the government to change the law to make them mandatory. \u201cIdeally, sprinklers would be fitted in all schools of whatever age and size. Sprinklers can assist in limiting the spread of fire, the damage it will cause and giving occupants additional time to escape, as well as reducing the risks faced by firefighters attending the incident.\u201d In March, the government launched a consultation on fire safety design in schools. It is yet to report back. The Department for Education said: \u201cSchools are fundamentally safe places, designed to be evacuated as quickly as possible in the event of a fire. \u201cAll schools are required to have an up-to-date fire risk assessment and to conduct regular fire drills \u2013 and all new school buildings must be signed off by an inspector to certify that they meet the requirements of building regulations.

We\u2019d like to see much closer monitoring of teachers\u2019 working hours, so that the impact of policy can be assessed as soon as possible. \u201cOverall, bolder plans are needed by the government to show they are serious about reducing working hours for teachers and bringing them into line with other countries.\u201d Teaching unions accused ministers of doing more to drive teachers out of the profession than to retain them. \u201cExcessive teacher workload is a persistent problem because governments constantly raise the bar on what they expect schools to do,\u201d said Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. \u201cVarious initiatives have been launched to reduce workload in recent years but schools have been swamped by changes to qualifications and testing, relentless pressure on performance and results, and funding cuts which have led to reductions in staffing and larger class sizes.\u201d The National Education Union, which represents more than 450,000 teachers in the UK, said excessive workload was one of the key reasons why a third of newly qualified teachers quit English classrooms within five years. \u201cThere is no reason to suppose this will change. In our most recent members\u2019 poll, 40% predicted they will no longer be in education by 2024,\u201d said Kevin Courtney, its joint general secretary. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cAs today\u2019s report shows, the number of hours teachers work has remained broadly unchanged over the last 25 years. We have, however, been making concerted efforts to reduce workload driven by unnecessary tasks - 94% of surveyed school leaders report they have taken action to reduce workload related to marking and more than three-quarters say they have addressed planning workload.\u201d",

Over the last 18 months the family has been subject to a number of micro cruelties \u2013 denial of a birthday cake for two-year-old Tharunicaa, and arbitrary rule changes around visitation. The allowance and then withdrawal of external childcare, an alleged lack of vitamins and dental care leading to painful teeth issues for Tharunicaa, and the alleged delay in medication for Priya. When the family first arrived they weren\u2019t allowed to interact with fellow detainee and Vietnamese woman Huyen and her infant daughter Isabella. That changed and the two families soon became as close as family. But then the Tamils were ripped away on a Friday evening, with no chance to say goodbye. Isabella is 18 months old and has lived her life in the facility. After losing her sisters, aunty and uncle, this was another cruelty on top of she and Huyen\u2019s own list of illogical cruelties. A zero-notice deportation can prevent legal injunctions \u2013 although it didn\u2019t this time. But what is the logical explanation for a pre-dawn raid on a house with a family who wasn\u2019t going anywhere? What is the logical explanation for denial of a birthday cake? What is the logical explanation for the midnight transfers of countless other adults in onshore detention which send them out of reach of their families? There are others who have been rejected, deported and then disappeared, arrested, or even killed after they return to their home country. There are also thousands of people who were found to be refugees but who aren\u2019t allowed to stay in Australia at all, or who can stay but only for three years until they must ask again. But it is the Tamil family\u2019s cause which has been singularly taken up by people like Alan Jones, Barnaby Joyce and Anthony Albanese, who have called for them to stay. Why has Labor, which largely agrees with most of the Coalition\u2019s border control policies, chosen to fight for this family and none of the others? There is a festival of double standards \u2013 from those who support this family\u2019s freedom but not the freedom of others, from those who say there can be no exceptions for this family but then make exceptions for au pairs and drug traffickers, and from those who cry \u201cprecedent\u201d. Dutton and Morrison have repeatedly said that intervening here would send a message to people smugglers, but multiple media investigations have found there to be no evidence of that. Abul Rivzi, former deputy secretary in the Department of Immigration, said the Tamil case was actually one which the minister should have intervened in precisely because of the message it would send. Around 100,000 people are currently in Australia seeking asylum or in courts fighting their rejected claims. Rivzi told the ABC last week the family had community ties and had settled in remote and regional Australia, just like the government wants migrants to do, and the case was always likely to go \u201call the way down the line\u201d at extraordinary cost of at least $1m. \u201cThe rationale as I understand it is that if [the minister] were to intervene and grant a visa in this case, they\u2019d be under pressure to use the discretion in lots and lots and lots of other cases,\u201d he said. \u201cBut look at it the other way around. If a large portion of those 100,000 cases go through the pain and cost of this case, what does that mean? Does the home affairs department have the money to go through all those cases? Obviously not.\u201d The federal government has backed itself into a political corner where it has two choices: to let them stay and look weak, or to boot them out and look cruel. They haven\u2019t feared looking cruel in the past. There is a good chance the family will be sent back to Sri Lanka. Thousands of others already have been. There is some chance they\u2019ll be allowed to apply to come back on work or other visas, having had their deportation bill and reentry bans waived. What remains is whether this case prompts some reassessment of values or even the pursuit of just a bit of logic in how Australia treats people.",

There is community here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem is finding housing.\u201d Neumann, an attorney with the East Bay Community Law Center, said the threats of a law enforcement crackdown were \u201cconsistent with the general approach of the administration \u2013 to cause as much pain and suffering as possible to people who are desperately seeking refuge\u201d, adding: \u201cThey do it on the border, and now they are proposing to do it in the cities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The founder of Momentum, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn, has succeeded in a bid to make the party effectively abolish its 40-year-old student wing, which is dominated by the more centrist side of the party. Jon Lansman won the backing of Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC) for a motion that argued Labour Students was not officially affiliated and should be replaced. The motion said Labour Students had not paid affiliation fees but this was disputed by Rania Ramli, its chair, who wrote to Jennie Formby, the party\u2019s general secretary, setting out its case. Labour Students could now look at a legal challenge on the grounds it has been excluded on the basis of inaccurate information. The move against Labour Students was condemned by a number of MPs as counterproductive at a time when the party should be focusing on preparing for an election rather than internal rows. Several accused the NEC of targeting Labour Students because it has links with MPs on the more centrist side of the party and is not associated with Corbyn\u2019s politics. Wes Streeting, a Labour MP and former president of the National Union of Students as a Labour Students candidate, said: \u201cThe Labour party should be focusing all its energies on winning the next general election, not Jon Lansman\u2019s factional vendettas against Labour Students. It is literally student politicking, when we\u2019re in the fight our lives for the future of the country.\u201d Stella Creasy, another Labour MP, added: \u201cWhy at such a critical time in our country, and with an election on the horizon, does anyone who wants Labour to be an effective force for good think this is the time for such attempts to silence parts of our youth movement ,when we need them to be seen and heard campaigning?\u201d The motion put to the NEC said that the \u201corganisation which currently describes itself as \u2018Labour Students\u2019 claims to be an organisation affiliated to the Labour party\u201d but in fact did not meet all the terms required for affiliation. \u201cThe NEC therefore asks general secretary to urgently devise a plan to establish a Labour Students organisation which does meet its obligations,\u201d it said. The motion passed after a lengthy meeting of the NEC before next week\u2019s party conference in Brighton. A Labour party source said: \u201cThe NEC has asked staff to draw up proposals for a reformed student organisation that complies with the rules and represents the tens of thousands of students in our party.\u201d Labour Students reacted to the motion with dismay, saying it was based on \u201cfalse and inaccurate claims which we have not had the opportunity to address\u201d. A Momentum source said: \u201cIt\u2019s a victory for democracy that the rotten borough of Labour Students has finally been reformed.

In came Albert Celades, former Spain Under-21 manager, with the club\u2019s president, Anil Murthy, saying one of the reasons behind the switch was the fact that \u201cValencia must defend its philosophy of promoting young players who have come through the academy, and give them the opportunity to compete at the highest levels. The kind of player that has grown with the club since they were children and truly represent our values. They are the foundation of a team that must balance the club\u2019s ambitions with a long-term sustainable model.\u201d</p> <p>Well, that sounds familiar. And in his very first game Celades helped one brilliant young player to make the headlines, although unfortunately the player involved, Ansu Fati, played for the opposition. Valencia lost 5-2 at Barcelona, 16-year-old Fati scored one and assisted another, while the visitors fielded five players aged 30 or above and only three below 25. Some work to go with the whole young-player thing, then. </p> <p>On the very same day in Wolverhampton Chelsea were also involved in a 5-2 scoreline, although they had the best of it at Wolverhampton. It\u2019s been a very promising start for Frank Lampard and his band of merry tykes, even if they are yet to keep a clean sheet, and this certainly has the potential to be another forward step even if there is strong anything-can-happen potential. </p> <p>Celades is a fan of the 4-3-3, though is widely expected to stick with his predecessor\u2019s 4-4-2 until he\u2019s had a bit more time on the training ground. Still, with Chelsea playing 4-3-3 for most of the season (albeit they went with a back three at Molineux) perhaps this would be a decent day to unveil the big switch.</p> <p>Anyway, and without further ado, hello! Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s pre-match preview:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/frank-lampard-chelsea-valencia-champions-league\">Frank Lampard wary of Valencia threat despite off-field uncertainty</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

Here\u2019s a Champions League round-up, including Erling H\u00e5land\u2019s hat-trick for Red Bull Salzburg. \u201cThere will be bumps in the road,\u201d Lampard concludes, \u201cfor any team especially us with the youth and the changes we\u2019re making. We have to be strong, and we have Liverpool coming at the weekend and we have to be ready.\u201d So if Ross Barkley was the designated penalty taker, someone needs to have a word with Willian and Jorginho for undermining him as he prepared to take it. If he wasn\u2019t, he will have been doing some intense apologising. Frank Lampard insists that Ross Barkley was supposed to take the penalty all along: We shouldn\u2019t lose the game. At least not lose, probably win. We had a fair few chances, not incredible chances, then we had the penalty which we missed. It\u2019s a lesson for us, but there\u2019s five games to go. Ross is a penalty-taker, he has been when he starts the games. That\u2019s why he took it. It\u2019s a great story to say there\u2019s contention between players. There isn\u2019t. Ross took it and missed. He took them pre-season and scored. He\u2019s missed the penalty, that\u2019s it. Of course you have designated penalty takers. Ross was that, and he missed. I took penalties, I missed some. It comes with the territory. There\u2019s no issue among the dressing-room. Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s match report from Stamford Bridge: It was a night when Frank Lampard\u2019s young players found out that no competition is as unforgiving as the Champions League. It was a night of missed opportunities and when it was over Chelsea were left wondering how they had failed to take at least a point from a tight game. The frustration for Lampard is that he had warned his team not to place too much stock in Valencia\u2019s apparent state of utter turmoil. The Spaniards were wily opponents throughout and while they were fortunate to hold on to their 1-0 lead after Ross Barkley skied a late penalty, their combative display means Chelsea are already under huge pressure in Group H. Much more here: Don\u2019t just take my word for it: here\u2019s some footage of the penalty incident. Cesar Azpilicueta talks: Of course it\u2019s hard to take. Because we had better chances, we controlled the game. We know, Champions League is decided on small details. Free kick, they scored a goal, and obviously we couldn\u2019t convert our chances. Ross is one of the best penalty-shooters in the team. He\u2019s one of the ones that take them. He had the confidence to shoot it. He was unlucky hitting the bar, and obviously we\u2019re disappointed. Of course we are trying to build something special, something for the future. But we know we are at Chelsea, we need to get results straight away. Every game we play, we play to win. BT Sport show full footage of the penalty incident, in which Barkley grabbed the ball and was placing it on the spot before the referee even pointed it, and gave no ground as Jorginho and Willian both game up to ask if he\u2019s actually serious. \u201cSomehow he\u2019s jumped the queue. Credit to him for having the confidence but there\u2019s a certain protocol,\u201d sniffs Owen Hargreaves of Ross Barkley\u2019s penalty-snaffling. That was an excellent away performance from allegedly crisis-hit Valencia, defending smartly and coming up with a couple of good set-pieces which led to the game\u2019s two outstanding moments and the only goal. A different referee might have sent off Coquelin in the first 20 minutes, but overall the Spaniards deserved a point at the very least. 90+5 mins: And that\u2019s it! Chelsea are beaten at home in the first game of the group stage! 90+4 mins: And Chelsea get their last-second chance! Barkley\u2019s long cross flicks off a head to Alonso, who heads it back in, and Christensen rises highest but heads wide of the post! 90+4 mins: Alonso shoots! Not a terrible idea, but it\u2019s not close enough to the near corner and Cillessen saves. The corners is headed clear. 90+3 mins: Pedro is tripped on the edge of the area, on the right flank. Chelsea will have one final chance to create something from the resulting free-kick. 90+2 mins: A final Valencia change, Diakhaby replacing Cheryshev. 90+1 mins: There will be four minutes of stoppage time, or thereabouts. 90 mins: Valencia bring 18-year-old Lee Kangin in, while Rodrigo goes. 87 mins: Barkley looks calm and confident, but then like they say appearances can be deceptive. He he runs up, sends the keeper to his right and sidefoots straight down the middle, and the ball clips the top of the bar on its way over! 87 mins: Barkley puts the ball on the spot. Willian comes over, apparently to ask if he\u2019s really honesly going to take it. Jorginho comes over to wish him luck. 86 mins: He\u2019s only gone and given a penalty for that! 85 mins: The referee leaves the field to see the incident for himself. I think it would be extremely harsh to give a penalty for that. 85 mins: The game is paused while VAR checks for a potential penalty. 84 mins: The corner ends with Pedro, outside the area, whose shot also deflects wide. This corner is headed by Tomori into the arm of Wass. Chelsea players surround the referee, who didn\u2019t see anything wrong. 82 mins: A fine run from Barkley, who is running across the area and then suddenly, in the blink of an eye, is going in a totally different direction and heading into it, but his shot deflects wide. 80 mins: Another change for Chelsea, Ross Barkley coming on for Kovacic. 79 mins: Giroud spins on the edge of the area and hammers a left-foot shot straight at Cillessen. 77 mins: What with it coming from a set piece, I\u2019m not sure you can put the goal down to the change in shape to a back four, though obviously it coming within 120 seconds of Frank Lampard\u2019s tactical switch is not a good look. Throw a Kurt Zouma into that penalty area and things might have been different. Valencia grab a goal from nowhere! It\u2019s an excellent set-piece delivery from Parejo, and Rodrigo times his run perfectly and scuffs his left-foot volley into the ground, and it bounces past Kepa! 73 mins: Chelsea abandon the three-centre-backs thing, bringing Giroud on for Zouma. 73 mins: Rodrigo buys a ticket for the why-not-have-a-go lottery, but there\u2019s no jackpot this time, and his 45-yard effort flies high. 70 mins: Maxi Gomez comes on, replacing Gameiro in Valencia\u2019s front line. 69 mins: Why didn\u2019t Willian pass there? There\u2019s a three-man break, and Abraham on the right passes inside to Willian in the middle, who could have simply laid the ball off for the entirely unmarked Pedro to have a free shot on goal, but instead tries to burst past a defender, and fails. 68 mins: Willian feeds Azpilicueta, whose cross from the byline is deflected behind. The corner is headed clear. 66 mins: The game seems to be sinking into a bit of a fog. 62 mins: Save! Alonso hits low, just past the three-man wall, and Cillessen dives to his left to palm it round the post! A bit more power on that shot and it would surely have gone in! Then Alonso heads over from the corner. 62 mins: Gaya swishes his boot across Willian\u2019s ankles, conceding a free kick and handing Chelsea a decent shooting chance. Willian himself and Alonso stand over it. 61 mins: Another goal for Ajax, for whom Tagliafico has made it 3-0 against Lille in the other Group H game. 57 mins: Valencia work a clever corner, which ends with Gameiro running into ludicrous amounts of space on the edge of the area as the ball is rolled to him, and Chelsea\u2019s entire team deciding it\u2019s probably someone else\u2019s job to close him down. No matter, as he blasts his shot over the bar. 55 mins: Pedro fouls Wass with a fairly cynical trip, conceding a free-kick on the right wing. All this playing-well-but-not-quite-well-enough business might start to get frustrating after a while. 51 mins: Chelsea have once again started on the front foot, but Valencia are defending excellently and restricting the home side\u2019s fun to areas far enough from goal for it not to matter very much. 48 mins: Ajax meanwhile stroll into a two-goal lead over Lille in tonight\u2019s other Group H game. Edson Alvarez has scored their second. 48 mins: A Chelsea corner causes a moment of panic in the Valencia defence before being cleared, and then Willian\u2019s shot is charged down. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! Valencia get the second half started, and within five seconds pass Cillessen into trouble. Abraham is very close to charging down his clearance, and somehow hurts his wrist in the process. Valencia return to the field, so we should have more footballer very shortly. Depending on where the referee is, obviously. The Chelsea players are back out, and wondering where their opponents have got to. \u201cI\u2019m flicking through the various games (lots of decent ones to have to choose between tonight!) but every time I switch over to the Chelsea game I have to turn the volume up,\u201d sniffs Woolie Madden. \u201cThe difference in the crowd volume from the Napoli and Dortmund fans is a little embarrassing.\u201d That\u2019s a slightly unfairly high bar, though. 45+3 mins: And that\u2019s the end of the half! It\u2019s been decent, but nothing has quite worked out for either side in the final third. I guess that means the middle third has been impeccable. 45+2 mins: Azpilicueta is not having his best game. He\u2019s taking up good positions, but he keeps fluffing things in the final third. As I type that, though, he picks out Willian in the area, and he stings Cillessen\u2019s palms with a firm drive! 45+1 mins: Chelsea continue to press. Willian tries to backheel to Azpilicueta, but the ball is intercepted. There will be two minutes of stoppage time. 43 mins: Chelsea are ending the half as strongly as they started it. A low cross from the left arrives behind Abraham so he nudges the ball back to Jorginho, who shoots into a defender. 41 mins: What a ball from Kovacic! And a miss from Willian! Pedro passes to Kovacic on the left, with Abraham in the middle and Willian not properly marked behind him. Kovacic has to check back onto his right foot, a delay that seems to end their advantage, but then he makes up for it with a spectacularly good pass that loops over the defender and straight onto the Brazilian\u2019s boot. He collects, but then blooters his shot over! 40 mins: Willian goes on a lovely run from inside his own half into Valencia\u2019s penalty area, but then he hits a poor pass to the overlapping Azpilicueta. Goal kick. 37 mins: Now Alonso crosses from the left and Abraham, in his desperation to get on the end of it, accidentally volleys Gaya. Free kick. 36 mins: Tomori gets into the area, tries to pass to Abraham, collects the rebound and finally shoots wide enough that it almost turns into a decent cross to Azpilicueta to the right of goal, but the bounce is unkind and the move ends with a goal kick. 35 mins: Willian, Chelsea\u2019s No10, skips past Parejo, Valencia\u2019s No10, hares towards the area and then shoots low and hard, just beyond the left-hand post. 33 mins: Jorginho is in the book, after launching himself at Kondogbia. It was almost the opposite of Coquelin\u2019s caution, in that he hardly made any contact but the challenge was misguided enough to be worth a booking of its own. 30 mins: Valencia have the best chance of the game so far! It ends with a very decent shooting chance for Rodrigo, just outside the area, but his effort hits Gameiro and bounces away. 26 mins: Valencia meanwhile have awoken, having been dormant for the first quarter-hour. They ping the ball around the edge of Chelsea\u2019s area, but as soon as they get inside it they lose control, and it rolls through to Kepa. 24 mins: Chelsea have had 60% of possession, but other than that one half-chance that Abraham had from Azpilicueta\u2019s cross they have created very little. A quarter of the way through the game, and it\u2019s reaching needs-a-goal territory. 22 mins: Chelsea break, and Willian carries the ball forward on the right while Pedro sprints into acres of space over to the left. He goes unspotted, and the chance is wasted. 20 mins: Valencia\u2019s first attack ends with the ball being chipped through to Gaya, running from deep beyond the defence. His effort is saved by Kepa, and he was anyway offside. 19 mins: Elsewhere in Group H, Ajax have taken the lead at home to Lille. Quincy Promes with it. 17 mins: After Saturday\u2019s wonderstrike there are cries of \u201cshoot\u201d whenever Tomori gets the ball, no matter how far from goal he is. He ignores them, and instead the ball is chipped up to Abraham, who handles it in trying to control. Free kick. 16 mins: Mount looks extremely unhappy to be leaving the field, but leave it he must. He walks off unaided, though, and Pedro replaces him. 14 mins: Mount is still limping, but perhaps not for long: Pedro appears to be readying himself. 12 mins: Chelsea are looking very comfortable here, with Willian particularly sprightly. 11 mins: After lengthy treatment, Mount limps on. Willian takes an optimistic and pretty hopeless shot from the free kick. 9 mins: Coquelin gets an early booking. I\u2019m not sure it was intentional, but in following through after clearing the ball he planted his studs deep into Mount\u2019s ankle. I don\u2019t think he meant it, but the contact was pretty ugly. 8 mins: Chelsea swing the ball into the area, again from the right. It\u2019s a poor cross and goes straight to Wass, but he makes an absolute reeking howler of his clearance and very nearly tees up Abraham, forcing Kondogbia to throw a leg out to desperately intervene. 6 mins: Chance for Chelsea! A nice move down the right ends with Azpilicueta bursting to the byline and crossing to the near post, where Abraham sidefoots into Cillessen from an unpromising angle. Then the resulting corner is headed goalwards, but it\u2019s more easy work for the goalkeeper. 4 mins: Jorginho hits the ball over the defence and into the path of Abraham, but it bounces through to Cillessen. 3 mins: The ball enters a penalty area for the first time, though it\u2019s a Chelsea back-pass so no danger. There might be soon, though, the home side having somehow converted it into a Valencia throw-in in short order. 1 min: Peeeeep! They\u2019re off! We\u2019ve had anthems and handshakes, and are currently enjoying the coin toss. There\u2019s very little now standing between us and kick-off. The players are in the tunnel, and football is about to be played! This year\u2019s Champions League group stage ball (there\u2019ll be another one for the knockout rounds) is extremely colourful. Apparently it\u2019s \u201ca bold multi-coloured design incorporating traditional colours from the Uefa Champions League as well as those seen across stadiums worldwide\u201d. I think \u201ccolours seen across stadiums worldwide\u201d pretty clearly means \u201cwhatever colours we fancied\u201d. Frank Lampard speaks very quickly. Here\u2019s what he\u2019s got to say about tonight\u2019s formation - he\u2019s sticking with the back three that served him so well at Wolves at the weekend. I want us to be adaptable. I want us to be able to change. We did at the weekend. It doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to stay. This is the fourth time tonight\u2019s referee, Cuneyt Cakir, has taken charge of a match at Stamford Bridge. In positive omen news, Chelsea have won two and drawn one of the previous three. It is his first Valencia away game, though he was in charge of their 3-2 home win over Genoa in the Europa League a couple of weeks shy of a decade ago. That\u2019s just one change for Chelsea: Zouma is in, the injured Rudiger is out. Here are the teams again in text-based form, for anyone who can\u2019t see embedded tweets: Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Zouma, Christensen, Tomori, Azpilicueta, Jorginho, Kovacic, Alonso, Willian, Mount, Abraham. Subs: Barkley, Pedro, Caballero, Giroud, Pulisic, Batshuayi, Guehi. Valencia: Cillessen, Wass, Garay, Gabriel, Gaya, Coquelin, Parejo, Kondogbia, Cheryshev, Rodrigo, Gameiro. Subs: Domenech Jaume, Costa Jaume, Goncalo Guedes, Diakhaby, Lee, Torres, Gomez. Referee: Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey). Team news is in, and it looks like this: And here are Sid Lowe\u2019s reports on last week\u2019s managerial axe-swingery in Valencia: Hello world! Football club and all-round basket case Valencia are today\u2019s visitors to Stamford Bridge, still reeling from the sacking of Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral less than a week ago for the crime of not-much-really. In came Albert Celades, former Spain Under-21 manager, with the club\u2019s president, Anil Murthy, saying one of the reasons behind the switch was the fact that \u201cValencia must defend its philosophy of promoting young players who have come through the academy, and give them the opportunity to compete at the highest levels. The kind of player that has grown with the club since they were children and truly represent our values. They are the foundation of a team that must balance the club\u2019s ambitions with a long-term sustainable model.\u201d Well, that sounds familiar. And in his very first game Celades helped one brilliant young player to make the headlines, although unfortunately the player involved, Ansu Fati, played for the opposition. Valencia lost 5-2 at Barcelona, 16-year-old Fati scored one and assisted another, while the visitors fielded five players aged 30 or above and only three below 25. Some work to go with the whole young-player thing, then. On the very same day in Wolverhampton Chelsea were also involved in a 5-2 scoreline, although they had the best of it at Wolverhampton. It\u2019s been a very promising start for Frank Lampard and his band of merry tykes, even if they are yet to keep a clean sheet, and this certainly has the potential to be another forward step even if there is strong anything-can-happen potential. Celades is a fan of the 4-3-3, though is widely expected to stick with his predecessor\u2019s 4-4-2 until he\u2019s had a bit more time on the training ground. Still, with Chelsea playing 4-3-3 for most of the season (albeit they went with a back three at Molineux) perhaps this would be a decent day to unveil the big switch. Anyway, and without further ado, hello! Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s pre-match preview:",

Senior shadow cabinet figures \u2013 John McDonnell, Emily Thornberry, Tom Watson and Nick Brown \u2013 have all said they would want to campaign to stay in the bloc regardless of any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour.</p> <p>However, Corbyn\u2019s statement is the strongest sign yet that he will resist demands to pick a side and would opt to stay out of campaigning in a second referendum on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal, allowing him to pitch himself as the neutral referee who pledges to carry out whatever the public decides.</p> <p>This would help avoid the situation David Cameron found himself in as prime minister in 2016, when he resigned from No 10 after ending up on the losing side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/17/labour-final-say-brexit-boris-johnson-britain-eu\">Only Labour will give the people a final say on Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/17/labour-final-say-brexit-boris-johnson-britain-eu\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Corbyn laid down a marker of his determination to seek a better Brexit deal from the EU, which the party believes it could negotiate quickly based on conversations already undertaken with Brussels.</p> <p>\u201cA Labour government would secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated, including a new customs union with the EU; a close single market relationship; and guarantees of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would then put that to a public vote alongside remain. I pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>This would form the basis of what Corbyn describes as a \u201ccredible leave option\u201d which would be offered at a referendum against the option of remaining in the EU.</p> <p>Corbyn also positioned Labour as \u201cthe only UK-wide party ready to put our trust in the people of Britain to make the decision\u201d, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/lib-dems-pledge-to-revoke-brexit-without-referendum\">Liberal Democrats changed their position to campaigning for a revocation of article 50 in a bid to attract remain voters</a>.</p> <p>He said: \u201cJohnson wants to crash out with no deal. That is something opposed by business, industry, the trade unions and most of the public \u2013 and even by the Vote Leave campaign\u2019s co-convener, Michael Gove, who said earlier this year: \u2018We didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd now the Liberal Democrats want MPs to overturn the referendum result by revoking article 50 in a parliamentary stitch-up. It is simply undemocratic to override the decision of a majority of the voters without going back to the people.</p> <p>\u201cLabour is the only party determined to bring people together. Only a vote for Labour will deliver a public vote on Brexit. Only a Labour government will put the power back into the hands of the people. Let\u2019s stop a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and let the people decide.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s decision to set out his stall in favour of negotiating a Brexit deal and then putting that to a referendum presents a challenge to conference delegates over whether to back his stance or a more pro-remain position if it comes to a vote.</p> <p>An effort to change Labour\u2019s Brexit position will start on Saturday in Brighton, where delegates will discuss 80 motions submitted by local parties in favour of campaigning to remain in a second referendum.</p> <p>After a process called \u201ccompositing\u201d, one or two motions will emerge to be voted on by the wider conference later in the week. This may end up as a battle between largely remain-supporting activists and trade unions who favour Corbyn\u2019s position, unless the two sides can agree on a compromise motion that avoids a public row.</p> <p>A majority of the Brexit motions submitted have been put forward either by Another Europe is Possible (AEP) or two other groups, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour.</p> <p>Michael Chessum, from AEP, said: \u201cLabour has already crossed the Rubicon in promising a public vote with an option to remain. It would be utterly absurd, in those circumstances, for Labour not to campaign for remain when 90% of its members want to stay in the EU. Trying to prevent Labour from backing remain is a dead end for Corbyn \u2013 it will inevitably fail and it risks the morale of our base at at a crucial moment.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/tom-watson-to-break-labours-uneasy-truce-over-brexit\">used a speech</a> to argue that Labour should \u201cunambiguously and unequivocally back remain\u201d and also seek a second Brexit referendum before a general election. The idea was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/jeremy-corbyn-rejects-call-tom-watson-labour-fully-back-remain\">swiftly rejected</a> by Corbyn, who called it \u201cTom\u2019s view\u201d.</p> <p>In his article, Corbyn promised that he would back a general election as soon as Boris Johnson\u2019s threat of a no deal Brexit is avoided through an extension to article 50.</p> <p>The issue of Brexit is likely to dominate Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton but there will also be debate over the campaign pushing for the party to adopt a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, involving a zero carbon target by 2030 and more green jobs.</p> <p>Separately, the party\u2019s national executive committee met on Tuesday to agree rule changes to speed up expulsions from Labour in serious cases of wrongdoing, which will be put to a vote at conference.</p> <p>Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum and a key Corbyn ally, won the NEC\u2019s backing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/17/labour-purges-its-student-wing-ahead-of-party-conference\">to effectively abolish its 40-year-old student wing</a>, which is dominated by the more centrist side of the party. The motion said Labour Students was not officially affiliated and should be replaced, claiming it had not paid its fees. This was disputed by Rania Ramli, its chair. </p> <p>The NEC also agreed to consider ways to speed up selections for parliamentary candidates in key seats. Some MPs believe this will lead to candidates being parachuted in from the centre rather than letting local parties decide in all circumstances, although proposals have not yet been worked up by party officials.</p>",

The Labour leader set out how he would go into an election offering to negotiate a Brexit deal involving a customs union, ahead of next week\u2019s party conference where activists will launch a bid to shift the party\u2019s position towards campaigning to remain in the EU. At the annual gathering in Brighton, some members will attempt to force a conference vote on the issue, with the aim of getting a promise to campaign for remain in the party\u2019s next general election manifesto. Senior shadow cabinet figures \u2013 John McDonnell, Emily Thornberry, Tom Watson and Nick Brown \u2013 have all said they would want to campaign to stay in the bloc regardless of any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour. However, Corbyn\u2019s statement is the strongest sign yet that he will resist demands to pick a side and would opt to stay out of campaigning in a second referendum on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal, allowing him to pitch himself as the neutral referee who pledges to carry out whatever the public decides. This would help avoid the situation David Cameron found himself in as prime minister in 2016, when he resigned from No 10 after ending up on the losing side. Writing in the Guardian, Corbyn laid down a marker of his determination to seek a better Brexit deal from the EU, which the party believes it could negotiate quickly based on conversations already undertaken with Brussels. \u201cA Labour government would secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated, including a new customs union with the EU; a close single market relationship; and guarantees of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would then put that to a public vote alongside remain. I pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.\u201d This would form the basis of what Corbyn describes as a \u201ccredible leave option\u201d which would be offered at a referendum against the option of remaining in the EU. Corbyn also positioned Labour as \u201cthe only UK-wide party ready to put our trust in the people of Britain to make the decision\u201d, after the Liberal Democrats changed their position to campaigning for a revocation of article 50 in a bid to attract remain voters. He said: \u201cJohnson wants to crash out with no deal. That is something opposed by business, industry, the trade unions and most of the public \u2013 and even by the Vote Leave campaign\u2019s co-convener, Michael Gove, who said earlier this year: \u2018We didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal.\u2019 \u201cAnd now the Liberal Democrats want MPs to overturn the referendum result by revoking article 50 in a parliamentary stitch-up. It is simply undemocratic to override the decision of a majority of the voters without going back to the people. \u201cLabour is the only party determined to bring people together. Only a vote for Labour will deliver a public vote on Brexit. Only a Labour government will put the power back into the hands of the people. Let\u2019s stop a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and let the people decide.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s decision to set out his stall in favour of negotiating a Brexit deal and then putting that to a referendum presents a challenge to conference delegates over whether to back his stance or a more pro-remain position if it comes to a vote. An effort to change Labour\u2019s Brexit position will start on Saturday in Brighton, where delegates will discuss 80 motions submitted by local parties in favour of campaigning to remain in a second referendum. After a process called \u201ccompositing\u201d, one or two motions will emerge to be voted on by the wider conference later in the week. This may end up as a battle between largely remain-supporting activists and trade unions who favour Corbyn\u2019s position, unless the two sides can agree on a compromise motion that avoids a public row. A majority of the Brexit motions submitted have been put forward either by Another Europe is Possible (AEP) or two other groups, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour. Michael Chessum, from AEP, said: \u201cLabour has already crossed the Rubicon in promising a public vote with an option to remain. It would be utterly absurd, in those circumstances, for Labour not to campaign for remain when 90% of its members want to stay in the EU. Trying to prevent Labour from backing remain is a dead end for Corbyn \u2013 it will inevitably fail and it risks the morale of our base at at a crucial moment.\u201d Last week, Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, used a speech to argue that Labour should \u201cunambiguously and unequivocally back remain\u201d and also seek a second Brexit referendum before a general election. The idea was swiftly rejected by Corbyn, who called it \u201cTom\u2019s view\u201d. In his article, Corbyn promised that he would back a general election as soon as Boris Johnson\u2019s threat of a no deal Brexit is avoided through an extension to article 50. The issue of Brexit is likely to dominate Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton but there will also be debate over the campaign pushing for the party to adopt a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, involving a zero carbon target by 2030 and more green jobs. Separately, the party\u2019s national executive committee met on Tuesday to agree rule changes to speed up expulsions from Labour in serious cases of wrongdoing, which will be put to a vote at conference. Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum and a key Corbyn ally, won the NEC\u2019s backing to effectively abolish its 40-year-old student wing, which is dominated by the more centrist side of the party. The motion said Labour Students was not officially affiliated and should be replaced, claiming it had not paid its fees. This was disputed by Rania Ramli, its chair. The NEC also agreed to consider ways to speed up selections for parliamentary candidates in key seats. Some MPs believe this will lead to candidates being parachuted in from the centre rather than letting local parties decide in all circumstances, although proposals have not yet been worked up by party officials.",

      "bodyText": "Post-match reading ... Barney Ronay on doing your homework Some Klopp quotes Andy Hunter\u2019s report Jurgen Klopp speaks: He\u2019s in very animated form as he chats with BT Sport\u2019s Des Kelly. \u201cYeah of course, it should hurt,\u201d he says, upon asked if he\u2019s fed up by the defeat. \u201cThere were opportunities to win this and it was much better than in the last game [against Napoli in this stadium last season] when we lost in the last minute.\u201d Asked about the concession of the goals, he seems fairly matter-of-fact. \u201cWe started controlling a wild game in the second half and then we conceded a penalty,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw it again and it\u2019s clear and obvious to me that Callejon jumped before he was touched. But there\u2019s nothing we can do about that.\u201d He goes on to say that \u201cwe had not enough chances at the end, to be perfectly honest\u201d and bemoaned his team\u2019s uncharacteristically poor decision-making in the final third. \u201cWe made these decisions that were not right tonight and that was what led to the result,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was often the final ball that was not right, but it\u2019s difficult because of the intensity of the game. There were moments when we should have done better, for sure.\u201d Andy Hunter was in the Stadio San Paolo for the Guardian and here\u2019s the piping hot take on Liverpool\u2019s defeat that he filed on the final whistle. Elsewhere in Group E: Austrian side RB Salzburg have thrashed Belgian outfit Genk by a tennis score: 6-2, with Erling Haaland bagging himself a first-half hat-trick. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It\u2019s all over and Napoli have won. They\u2019ve beaten a Liverpool side that has now lost four successive group stage matches away from home. Errors cost them. The first came from Andy Robertson, who I think can consider himself rather hard done by in giving away a penalty, but did unnecessarily give the ref a decision to make. Closer to the death, Virgil van Dijk cost his side with an uncharacteristically rogue pass. 90+3 min: The Stadio San Paolo is a riot of colour and noise as the home fans celebrate their team\u2019s late triumph. Big Virgil was at fault for that one, I\u2019m afraid, ruining an otherwise flawless display with a wayward pass across his own area to Joel Matip that Fernando Llorente did well to anticipate and pounce upon. The Spanish striker could scarcely have been more alert and stuck the ball under Adrian to upon his Napoli account. Napoli double their lead. Fernando Llorente scores his first goal for Napoli on only his second appearance, pouncing to scuff the ball home after a mix-up in the Liverpool defence. The guilty party? Your friend and mine, Mr Virgil van Dijk. 90+1 min: We\u2019re into the first of five added minutes. 89 min: With his side ahead very much against the run of recent play, Mertens picks out Callejon with a wonderful cross-field ball and his cross from the right is just a mite too high for Llorente. 86 min: Manolas heads a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross just wide of his own goal. Liverpool substitution: Xherdan Shaqiri on for Jordan Henderson. 84 min: VAR?!?!?!? VARce more like. Replays show that Andy Robertson quite clearly and obviously didn\u2019t foul Callejon ... but didn\u2019t foul him quite clearly and obviously enough for the referee\u2019s decision to be overturned by VAR. Expect much comical mouth-foaming, along with the usual cries of conspiracy from Liverpool Twitter tonight. Napoli lead! Dries Mertens scores into the bottom right-hand corner, despite Adrian getting a hand to the ball. Despite the fact that Robertson didn\u2019t seem to foul Callejon, the lads in the VAR room haven\u2019t seen fit to view the decision as a clear and obvious error. Napoli get their spot-kick. Andrew Robertson brings down Callejon with a leg that\u2019s hanging in the wind, but it\u2019s going to VAR. 78 min: Kostas Manolas does well to prevent Sadio Mane reaching a cross from the right on the stretch and poking it goalwards. 77 min: Liverpool are definitely dominating the game at the moment, but have yet to convert their superiority into the cold, hard currency of goals. Napoli have noticeably gone to pieces since making their substitutions. 75 min: Final Napoli substitution: Allan hobbles off, still suffering from cramp. He\u2019s replaced by Macedonia international Eljif Elmas, who comes on for his Champions League debut. 74 min: From about 12 yards out, Sadio Mane shoots low and hard after having the ball put into his path by Bobby Firmino. Alex Meret gets down quickly to save. 72 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Napoli midfielder goes down with cramp. He gets assistance from a team-mate, who helps him stretch his calves. 70 min: Into the final 20 minutes we go, with the deadlock unbroken. Following his mistake a few moments ago that almost let Mo Salah in to score, Napoli centre-back Kostas Manolas looks a bag of nerves at the moment. 68 min: Napoli substitution: Fernando Llorente on, Hirving Lozano off. 66 min: Liverpool substitution: Gini Wijnaldum on for James Milner. Napoli substitution: Piotr Zielinski on for Lorenzo Insigne. 65 min: Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret saves brilliantly by getting a fingertip to a low, diagonal Mo Salah shot after the Egyptian had pounced on a comically sliced clearance from Manolas that went behind the central defender. 64 min: Dries Mertens tries a shot from distance, but it\u2019s blocked by James Milner. 61 min: James Milner gets booked for his second foul in quick succession, a late lunge on Callejon in this case. 60 min: Hirving Lozano sprints into the right side of the Liverpool penalty area and tries to square the ball, but Big Virgil is having none of it and blocks. 58 min: Napoli win a free-kick wide on the right for a Fabinho foul that\u2019s flagged up by the linesman. From the set piece, Callejon\u2019s cross sails into the arms of Adrian. 57 min: Andy Robertson is booked for pulling on the arm of Callejon and breaking up a Napoli attack. The Scot protests his innocence, but can\u2019t really have any complaints. 54 min: Napoli appeal for a penalty after an Insigne cross hits Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s arm. No spot-kick is forthcoming as the Liverpool full-back\u2019s arm was right by his side. From the ensuing corner, Liverpool counter-attack and have a two-on-one, but an excellent goal chance goes begging when Sadio Mane makes a dog\u2019s breakfast of what should have been the decisive pass to Mo Salah. Liverpool should have scored there. 53 min: More excellent defending on a night where both back fours have been outstanding. This time Van Dijk calmly gets across to intercept a squared ball from Jose Callejon, who\u2019d been picked out in the Liverpool penalty area by Dries Mertens. 49 min: Dries Mertens is denied by an excellent save from Adrian, after Virgil van Dijk had been beaten by the flight of a Fabian Ruiz dink from the left. Mertens leapt to volley home at the far post, but Adrian saved brilliantly with a strong right hand that pushed the ball over the bar. 48 min: Lozano tries to pick out Fabian Luiz on the left touchline, but Trent Alexander-Arnold intercepts. 47 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Hirving Lozano receives medical treatment, specifically the entire contents of a can of painkilling spray on his lower back. He\u2019ll live. 46 min: Roberto Firmino tries to steer a pass into the path of Mane in the Napoli penalty area, but his cross-hairs are not aligned correctly and Giovanni Di Lorenzo cuts out the danger by hacking clear. 46 min: Napoli get the ball rolling, with no changes of personnel on either side. Elsewhere in Group E: Austrian side RB Salzburg are piling the hurt on their Belgian opponents Genk, who they lead 5-1 at half-time. Their Leeds born Norwegian striker Erling Haaland, 19-year-old son of Roy Keane\u2019s good pal Alfie Inge Haaland, has scored a hat-trick. A goalless but very entertaining first half, punctuated by very few interventions from the referee draws to a close. Roberto Firmino had the pick of Liverpool\u2019s few chances, while Fabian Ruiz came closest to putting the home side ahead. 44 min: The corner is taken short and Milner sends a cross towards the far post. From a good distance out, Roberto Firmino gets a free header which flashes wide of the upright. Alex Meret was caught completely flat-footed in goal for Napoli - it Firminho had got his header on target Liverpool would be ahead. 43 min: Liverpool attack on the break, with James Milner on the ball. He tries to curl a low ball towards Sadio Mane up in support and haring into the penalty area. Ruiz is back to cut out the cross and concede a corner from which Liverpool nearly score. 42 min: Napoli corner. Mertens sends the ball into the mixer, where Van Dijk heads clear for Liverpool. Mario Ruiz sends the ball back into the penalty area, where it\u2019s headed clear again. 41 min: Koulibaly concedes a free-kick in the channel between the Napoli penalty area and the left touchline after catching Sadio Mane with a stray arm. Nothing comes of it. 40 min: Fabian Ruiz sends a teasing cross into the Liverpool penalty area, where Virgil van Dijk does just enough to prevent Hirving Lozano sliding in and poking it goalwards. 37 min: On Monday\u2019s Football Weekly podcast (available free in all the usual pod places) I said that Liverpool\u2019s front three are practically impossible to defend against, but Napoli are doing a very good job of keeping them at bay tonight. The Italian side\u2019s goalkeeper, Alex Meret, has only had one save to make so far and must be mightily reassured by the sight of the two-man portcullis that is Kalidou Koulibaly and Kostas Manolas in front of him. 35 min: Liverpool go forward after a sustained spell of possession from Napoli, but once again the Italian side\u2019s defending is stout and they fail to make much ground. 33 min: Insigne gets the ball caught under his feet under pressure from Alexander-arnold in the Liverpool penalty area. With a better first touch he might have fashioned an excellent scoring chance in that position. 32 min: After just over half an hour, its scoreless but excellent fun and I have Napoli winning very narrowly on points. 31 min: The ball finds its way to the feet of Mertens on the edge of the Liverpool penalty area, but Sadio Mane gets in his way before he can pull the trigger. 29 min: Hirving Lozano tries to pick out Mertens with a cross from the inside left, but his delivery is blocked and loops up into the air and into the warm embrace of Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian. Some very promising attacking play from both sides is being thwarted by some outstanding defending from both sides. 28 min: Dries Mertens fouls Trent Alexander-Arnold as the pair of them sprint after a loose ball in the Liverpool penalty area. 26 min: Good defending from Joel Matip, who stoops to head the ball behind for a corner, after Dries Mertens had whipped in a cross and Lozano was waiting to pounce from six or seven yards out. Nothing comes from the set piece. 24 min: Virgil van Dijk gets across to dispossess Dries Mertens, who\u2019d been put into space by a pass from deep in behind Andy Robertson. Corner for Napoli, which Van Dijk clears. 22 min: Mo Salah drives into the Napoli penalty area and gets goal side of Koulibaly, who resists the temptation to bring the Egyptian down. Running down a blind alley, Salah picks out James Milner on the edge of the area and the midfielder shoots high over the bar. 20 min: Napoli are piling forward at every opportunity, giving Liverpool plenty of opportunities to attack on the break. The first quarter of this game is being quite some lick and Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret is pressed into action for the first time, getting down to save a Sadio Mane shot from a tight angle at his near post. 16 min: At the other end, Virgil van Dijk is on hand to block an attempted cross to Hirving Lozano from Insigne on the left wing. Moments previously, Liverpool were forced to clear their lines as Ruiz squared the ball into their penalty area with Mertens lurking. Van Dijk it was, who cleared. 15 min: A rock in the heart of Napoli\u2019s defence, Koulibaly steps up again, this time to block an attempted cross by Trent Alexander-Arnold. 14 min: Napoli win a throw-in deep in Liverpool territory, then another. Now they win a corner, as Milner puts the ball out of play rather than let Giovanni Di Lorenzo get past him on the byline. Nothing comes of it. 13 min: Another good tackle from Koulibaly, who gets back to dispossess Mo Salah as he tried to jink past the defender after being played into the Napoli penalty area by Fabinho. 12 min: Kalidou Koulibaly dives in to dispossess Roberto Firmino with a perfectly timed tackle in the Napoli penalty area and earns himself a loud roar of approval from the home fans. 10 min: Lorenzo Insigne runs on to an excellent pass from deep into the penalty area by Allan, but Trent Alexander-Arnold reads his intention and is first to the ball. 8 min: Chance! Chance! Chance! Fabian Ruiz shoots twice in quick succession from about 15 yards out, his second effort a follow-up saved by Adrian after the goalkeeper had parried his first back into the midfielder\u2019s path. Lozano nods home the second rebound but is correctly flagged for offside. That\u2019s a fairly impressive double-save from Adrian, who is making his Champions League debut in goal for Liverpool. 6 min: Dreis Mertens tries to pick out Hirving Solano with a curling cross from the right, but Joel Matip heads clear. 5 min: Liverpool break down the field on a counter-attack, which breaks down when Salah is unable to pick out Sadio Mane with a pass. Allan, one of Napoli\u2019s central midfielders, intercepts with a crucial block. 3 min: Liverpool win a corner after good work down the right from Mo Salah. As the ball sails into the penalty area, Kostas Manolas catches Roberto Firmino with an elbow and the Brazilian goes to ground but the referee blows for an offside. That looked like it should have been a penalty to me, but the VAR officials don\u2019t appear to agree. 2 min: The fans are a long way from the pitch in Napoli\u2019s throwback of a stadium, which didn\u2019t have functional dressing-rooms this time last week due to renovations that didn\u2019t finish on time. They are, however, making plenty of noise. 1 min: There\u2019s a slight delay as referee Felix Brych appears to deal with some technical issue with his ear-piece before play gets under way. Not long now: The teams line up in the tunnel and make their way out on to the pitch led by referee Felix Brych and his team of match officials. Napoli\u2019s players wear light blue shirts, white shorts and light blue socks. Liverpool\u2019s players wear red shirts, shorts and socks. Jurgen Klopp speaks: \u201cThe game plan?\u201d he says to BT Sport\u2019s dishy, debonair pitchside reporter Des Kelly. \u201cThe opponents line-up is very offensive. It will be tricky, it will be lively ... it will have to be very intense. We\u2019ll have to be brave with the ball and first of all defend them. We have to adapt in the game, but the best way is if we have the ball and pass it around.\u201d The Liverpool Echo report that a number of Liverpool fans were attacked in Naples this evening. Some had bottles thrown at them by home fans, while others were surrounded by men on mopeds and whipped with belts. \u201cWe were just trying to have a quiet drink before going to the apartment and had just paid our bar bill,\u201d one supporter, who did not wish to be named, told the Echo. \u201cNext minute we could see about 10 scooters flying down. They slowed right down and their faces were covered with scarves and helmets. Next second they are jumping off swinging belts towards us. Must have all happened in 90 seconds but some lad got hit by a belt. Twice I\u2019ve had bother here now. I am never coming back.\u201d Merseyside Police have since released a statement. \u201cWe can confirm two Liverpool fans were reported to have been assaulted in Naples earlier today\u201d it read. \u201cAt around 6pm local time (5pm GMT), it was reported a number of males on scooters approached the fans at a bar in the city before assaulting them. \u201cTwo men from the UK, aged 26 and 46, sustained superficial cuts and grazes to the head and were treated at the scene before continuing to attend the match. \u201cLocal police are aware and Merseyside Police are working with police colleagues in Naples to assist in the policing of the Champions League fixture tonight.\u201d Napoli: Meret, Allan, Manolas, Koulibaly, Mario Rui, Callejon, Ruiz, Lozano, Mertens, Di Lorenzo Insigne Subs: Ospina, Llorente, Elmas, Maksimovic, Zielinski, Ghoulam, Milik. Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Matip, Van Dijk, Robertson, Fabinho, Milner, Henderson, Roberto Firmino, Mane, Salah Subs: Kelleher, Wijnaldum, Lovren, Gomez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Shaqiri. Referee: Felix Brych (Germany) Team news: Andy Robertson has been passed fit to play in a Liverpool side that features three changes from the side that started against Newcastle on Saturday. Jordan Henderson and James Milner come into midfield, with Gini Wijnaldum and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain making way. Roberto Firminho comes in for Divock Origi and will make his 200th appearance for the club. Carlo Ancelotti has picked a very attacking Napoli side, with Jose Callejon, Dries Mertens, Lorenzo Insigne and Hirving Lozano all starting. Defender Kostas Manolas and midfielder Allan are also drafted in as Nikola Maksimovic, Piotr Zielinski and Elif Elmas drop out. Despite fronting up for last night\u2019s press conference, Fernando Llorente starts on the bench, as does Arkadiusz Milik, who can\u2019t seem to decide whether or not he\u2019s fit to play. Carlo Ancelotti speaks: \u201cLiverpool have improved because winning the Champions League gives you belief,\u201d said Napoli\u2019s manager. \u201cWe have improved too though and we\u2019ve bolstered our squad with the addition of some quality players. I think it will be a great game \u2013 hard fought and intense. \u201cWe want to play a starring role, first by reaching the knockout stage and cementing our place as one of Europe\u2019s top clubs. We know how good we are and we want to prove it on the international stage. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t alter the way we play, regardless of the team I pick. Of course you have to keep the opposition in mind and the defensive side is very important but if you want to win matches you have to impose your game by playing to the strengths of your players.\u201d Jurgen Klopp speaks: \u201cIf you go nuts and start taking drugs and drinking and driving different cars or whatever, and leave your missus at home because you are now the Champions League winner then I can\u2019t help you,\u201d he joked, upon being asked if victory in the Champions League last season had gone to his players\u2019 heads. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel the burden of being champions,\u201d said Liverpool\u2019s manager. \u201cIt was long ago. Will teams play differently against us? I have no clue. I\u2019ve never won the Champions League before. I hope we are prepared for that. \u201cWe are trying to reach the same level as last year, we want to be consistent, play our football, use or skills and our confidence. We will judge improvement at the end of the season. For now, we just have to do our best.\u201d Early Napoli team news ... Left-winger Lorenzo Insigne returned from injury to come off the bench in Napoli\u2019s 2-0 win over Sampdoria at the weekend. Arkadiusz Milik had been expected to be available for selection following a stomach injury, but this match seems to have come a day or two too soon for the striker. Albanian right-back Elseid Hysaj has been ruled out, while one of Hirving Lozano or Fernando Llorente are likely to start up front alongside Dries Mertens. Llorente sat alongside Carlo Ancelotti at last night\u2019s press conference, in a state of affairs that suggests he might get the nod. Early Liverpool team news ... Andy Robertson didn\u2019t train yesterday for precautionary reasons, but Jurgen Klopp said it \u201cis not a major thing\u201d and the Scotsman seems likely to be passed fit. Divock Origi has been ruled out with the ankle injury he suffered against Newcastle on Saturday and did not travel to Italy. Alisson remains unavailable for selection following the calf injury he picked up during Liverpool\u2019s first game of the season, against Norwich City. Napoli\u2019s San Paolo Stadium is the venue for the beginning of Liverpool\u2019s Champions League title defence, following their victory over Tottenham Hotspur in last season\u2019s final in Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Wanda Metropolitano Stadium a little under four months ago. Liverpool last won consecutive European Cups in the mid-seventies, beginning a period of English dominance in the competition. Nottingham Forest emulated their feat in 1978-79 and 79-80, before Liverpool won their third final at the end of the 1980-81 campaign, before Aston Villa got in on the act in 1981-82. While both sides playing tonight should pass into the knockout stages with a minimum of fuss, retaining their title this season will be an extremely tall order for Liverpool. Since the European Cup morphed into the bloated, money-spinning behemoth that is the Champions League 27 years ago, only Real Madrid \u2013 with their trio of back-to-back-to-back titles earlier this decade \u2013 have managed to win more than one in a row. Kick-off tonight is at 8pm (BST), but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime.",

Judiciary spokesman Gholam Hossein Esmaeili confirmed the arrests in a press conference in Tehran. \u201cThis is true. These individuals have been detained in two cases and indictments have been issued for both.\u201d He said one of the cases related to images taken by two foreign nationals from military and restricted areas, and \u201cthe images have been retrieved from the memory of the camera which has been discovered and seized from them\u201d.

It has been reported that all three Australians were being held in Evin prison, though this was not confirmed by Esmaeili. British-Australian woman Jolie King and her Australian boyfriend, Mark Firkin, were arrested 10 weeks ago near the capital.

Dozens of videos and photographs posted online appear to have been shot using a drone. They went silent about 10 weeks ago after posting updates from Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan. Cambridge-educated academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who is also a dual-British citizen, has been held in Iran for \u201ca number of months\u201d according to her family. The Guardian understands she was arrested around September last year. Previous reports indicated she had been tried on espionage-related charges and sentenced to 10 years\u2019 jail, but Esmaeili said she was also still awaiting trial. Earlier reports also suggested she was being held in Evin in solitary confinement, but the judiciary spokesman offered no comment on this. Iran\u2019s semi-official Fars news agency quoted Esmaeili as saying the charges against Moore-Gilbert concerned alleged \u201cspying for another country\u201d, though he did not specify the country. Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at University of Melbourne, has written extensively about revolutions and activism in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Shia Islam, Bahraini politics and its protest movements. Moore-Gilbert\u2019s most recent publications have been journal articles and book chapters on Bahrain\u2019s \u201cFebruary 14\u201d pro-democracy youth movement and online opposition activism during Bahrain\u2019s post-Arab Spring crackdown. At the time she was arrested she held a grant to research \u201cIran\u2019s relationship with Bahrain\u2019s Shia after the Arab uprisings\u201d. The grant was part of the University of Melbourne\u2019s early career researcher grants scheme. The Australian government, which first revealed on 11 September that three of its citizens had been detained in Iran, has said it is providing consular assistance for the three detainees. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said there was \u201cno reason\u201d to believe the arrests were politically motivated. \u201cWe have no reason to think that these arrests are connected to international concern over Iran\u2019s nuclear program, United Nations sanction enforcement or maritime security concerning the safety of civilian shipping.\u201d In April Tehran\u2019s top diplomat, Mohammad Javad Zarif, raised the case of Negar Ghodskani, an Iranian woman arrested by Australia in 2017. Zarif proposed that Iranians jailed in the United States or other countries on extradition requests issued by the Americans could be swapped for US citizens held in Iran. Ghodskani has since been extradited to the US and confessed to participation in a conspiracy to illegally export technology to Iran in breach of sanctions. Australia said in August it would join a US-led naval coalition to escort commercial ships in the Gulf, after a spate of attacks blamed on Iran, but which Tehran denied. However, that announcement is understood to have come after the arrest of the three Australians in Iran. with Agence France-Presse",

The Yorkshire-born Norway international \u2013 the son of the former Nottingham Forest, Manchester City and Leeds midfielder Alf-Inge Haaland \u2013 scored his first in only the second minute before the 19-year-old completed his fourth hat-trick of the season before half-time. History was also made in Germany as the 16-year-old Ansu Fati became the youngest player to feature in a Champions League game for Barcelona but his side needed a penalty save from Marc\u2011Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen to rescue a 0-0 draw against Borussia Dortmund. Replays, though, showed Ter Stegen had been off his line when the spot-kick was taken, but there was no video assistant referee review.

However, the Argentina forward was not able to help conjure a goal, seeing a stoppage-time effort blocked.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 18 September. Top stories Josh Frydenberg overruled his department when he blocked two wind turbines on Lord Howe Island in 2017, forcing the world heritage-listed island to continue relying on diesel fuel for the bulk of its electricity. The former environment minister took the unusual action of blocking the project under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, deeming it \u201cunacceptable\u201d. It was one of only two projects that Frydenberg rejected while environment minister, both of which were criticised by the broadcaster Alan Jones. Many other projects, including Adani\u2019s groundwater plan and the Abbot Point coal terminal, were approved with conditions. The task of moderating Facebook continues to leave psychological scars on the company\u2019s workers, months after efforts to improve conditions, the Guardian has learned. A group of current and former contractors who worked for years at the social network\u2019s Berlin-based moderation centres has reported witnessing colleagues become \u201caddicted\u201d to graphic content and hoarding ever more extreme examples for a personal collection. They also said others were pushed towards the far right by the amount of hate speech and fake news they read every day. A judge will today reveal her reasons for slapping a $140m asset-freezing order on the controversial businessman and political donor Huang Xiangmo, after an application by the Australian Taxation Office. At an urgent hearing in Sydney on Monday, federal court judge Anna Katzmann ordered Huang not to dispose of assets worth up to the $140.9m claimed by the ATO, including more than $6m worth of property in Sydney and an apartment in Hong Kong. World The UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said he would \u201ccarry out whatever the people decide\u201d in a second EU referendum, with remain as an option, if he became prime minister. Meanwhile the government declined to rule out a fresh suspension of parliament if it lost its supreme court case. The United States government has filed a civil lawsuit against Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency whistleblower, over the publication this week of his memoir. Benjamin Netanyahu could be scrambling for his political survival over the coming days, after Israel election exit polls suggested he might struggle to form a governing coalition. Follow our live blog for the latest updates. An MIT scientist, Richard Stallman, has resigned over emails that appeared to show him downplaying another academic\u2019s alleged participation in the purported sex trafficking of minors by Jeffrey Epstein. Air pollution particles have been found on the foetal side of placentas, indicating that unborn babies are directly exposed to the black carbon produced by motor traffic and fuel burning. Opinion and analysis For years, the documentary maker Vanessa Engle has been on the trail of a notorious swindler who escaped from prison and disappeared into thin air. Then one day, the phone rang. \u201cYou probably haven\u2019t heard of Michel Cohen. Do a search and you get Michael Cohen, the Trump fixer who went to jail. Wrong one,\u201d writes Sam Wollaston. \u201cThough this one did go to jail, too. He\u2019s French, born in 1953 on an estate in a poor suburb of Paris and his first job was to sell the Encyclopedia Britannica door to door, which he was very good at. Cohen later went to the US and started selling French pat\u00e9, then prints. He got into the art world, became a dealer, sold Picassos, Monets, Chagalls. For a while he lived the dream \u2026 then he disappeared, having swindled the New York art world out of $50m.\u201d Perhaps we should explain climate change to politicians as we would to small children, writes hydrogeologist Emma White. \u201cWhen I was an undergrad learning geology, the maxim that was thumped into me wasn\u2019t how to build a mine or drill for oil and gas, it was simply: \u2018The present is the key to the past.\u2019 The thing that took a while to accept was that the past was really, really, long.

The biggest threat to the All Blacks\u2019 World Cup supremacy could well be themselves, writes Matt McIIlraith. Or their discipline, to be exact.

The Sydney Morning Herald reveals the NSW government is moving ahead with plans to build a third cruise ship terminal in Sydney, despite fierce local opposition. And the Financial Review reports that BHP has brushed off the government\u2019s complaints about big business \u201cpandering to activist shareholders\u201d and will press on with plans to take more responsibility for its carbon emissions. Coming up Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce and Virgin boss Paul Scurrah will appear at the National Press Club in Canberra to argue for changes to airport passenger fees. The Icac inquiry into an alleged plan by the ALP\u2019s NSW head office to circumvent donation laws continues in Sydney, with the Labor party\u2019s lawyer Ian Robertson appearing as a witness.

The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.<br></p>\n    <p>At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran\u2019s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\">lifted in January 2016</a>, reconnecting Iran to global markets.</p>\n    <p>The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iran</a>&nbsp;were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council\u2019s five permanent members \u2013 China, France, Russia, the UK and the US \u2013 and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.</p>\n    <p>On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/saeedkamalidehghan\">Saeed Kamali Dehghan</a>,</b>&nbsp;<i>Iran correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p> Since pulling out of the 2015 nuclear agreement last year, the US has imposed a policy of maximum economic pressure on Tehran, including a commitment to drive Iranian oil exports to zero.</p> \n<p>But Trump appears determined to ensure that Saudi Arabia takes a leading role in any military response, a move that has led some security experts to suggest the US, no longer a net importer of oil, is unwilling to act automatically as the security guarantor for Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, the Saudi energy minister said its oil output would be back to normal by the end of the month, claiming that half the production lost in the attack had already been restored.</p> \n<p>Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who was appointed to the role earlier this month, refused to be drawn on who was responsible for the strikes. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who is behind the attack,\u201d he said, adding that the kingdom wants \u201cproof based on professionalism and internationally recognised standards\u201d.</p> \n<p>He insisted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/12/oil-producer-saudi-aramco-makes-47bn-half-year-profit\">sale of Aramco</a> \u2013 Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil group \u2013 would continue as planned, adding that the Saudis had large oil reserves that it could draw upon to supply the market if necessary.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>But Pierre No\u00ebl, an energy specialist at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: \u201cThe Saudis lost in 30 minutes the war for which they had been preparing for 30 years.

As the leader of the European Tour\u2019s order of merit, he has plenty upon which to focus as the season edges towards its conclusion. External distractions have to be regarded as precisely that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m actually not a great person at saying \u2018no\u2019 to people,\u201d Lowry explained. \u201cThe lads give me a slap on the wrist for that every now and then.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, my time, we have talked about it a lot. We\u2019ve had a lot of meetings over the last while.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about how my time is obviously a bit more valuable now when I\u2019m at home just to get my stuff done and to get my time with the family and do all that type of stuff, and then when I\u2019m away at tournaments, to make sure that I use my time wisely. Stuff like that.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all going to take getting used to, but it\u2019s all good things. It\u2019s not bad things.\u201d</p> <p>Not so, Justin Rose. The Englishman\u2019s Wentworth participation is in doubt after a knee injury forced him to cancel Tuesday media commitments and withdraw from Wednesday\u2019s pro-am. \u201cI am doing everything I can to be fit to play on Thursday,\u201d said the former world No 1.</p>",

I just go about my day-to-day life, try and do things the way I want to do them and see where it leaves me at the end of the week and the end of the day. \u201cI suppose, look, when I\u2019m in that situation again \u2013 hopefully I\u2019m in that situation again a few times \u2013 I know I can pull it off. I\u2019m quite eager to get on with my golf and trying to achieve different goals I have the rest of the year.\u201d Letters of congratulation from Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, members of golf\u2019s royalty, resonated deeply with Lowry. Equally so, the scale of the reaction in his native Ireland. \u201cThe days and the weeks after, the Claret Jug is at home on the countertop in the kitchen and it\u2019s incredible,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten so used to it but you see the reaction when other people see it, how special it is. You wake up and you pinch yourself after doing it. The thing with the Open Championship is the history of the trophy and the history of the tournament; it is just incredible.\u201d That Lowry tends to remain on an emotional even keel is unquestionably to his benefit. As the leader of the European Tour\u2019s order of merit, he has plenty upon which to focus as the season edges towards its conclusion. External distractions have to be regarded as precisely that. \u201cI\u2019m actually not a great person at saying \u2018no\u2019 to people,\u201d Lowry explained. \u201cThe lads give me a slap on the wrist for that every now and then. \u201cObviously, my time, we have talked about it a lot. We\u2019ve had a lot of meetings over the last while. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about how my time is obviously a bit more valuable now when I\u2019m at home just to get my stuff done and to get my time with the family and do all that type of stuff, and then when I\u2019m away at tournaments, to make sure that I use my time wisely. Stuff like that. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to take getting used to, but it\u2019s all good things. It\u2019s not bad things.\u201d Not so, Justin Rose. The Englishman\u2019s Wentworth participation is in doubt after a knee injury forced him to cancel Tuesday media commitments and withdraw from Wednesday\u2019s pro-am. \u201cI am doing everything I can to be fit to play on Thursday,\u201d said the former world No 1.",

      "bodyText": "At a meeting of the Senate climate crisis task force on Tuesday, lawmakers praised a group of young activists for their leadership, their gumption and their display of wisdom far beyond their years. They then asked the teens for advice on how Congress might combat one of the most urgent and politically contentious threats confronting world leaders: climate change. Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who has galvanized young people across the world to strike for more action to combat the impact of global warming, politely reminded them that she was a student, not a scientist \u2013 or a senator. \u201cPlease save your praise. We don\u2019t want it,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t invite us here to just tell us how inspiring we are without actually doing anything about it because it doesn\u2019t lead to anything. \u201cIf you want advice for what you should do, invite scientists, ask scientists for their expertise. We don\u2019t want to be heard. We want the science to be heard.\u201d In remarks meant for Congress as a whole, she said: \u201cI know you are trying but just not hard enough. Sorry.\u201d The audience laughed. Supporters broke into applause. Senator Ed Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-sponsored the Green New Deal and leads the Senate task force, was perhaps surprised by her bluntness. But he smiled. Seated at the table with the teens were some of the most sympathetic and vocal supporters of bold action on climate change in Congress. But facing a Republican-controlled Senate and a hostile White House, the prospect of enacting reforms at the scale and scope called for by activists \u2013 and many scientists \u2013 is bleak. \u201cWe need your leadership,\u201d Markey told Thunberg. \u201cYoung people are the army politically, which has arrived in the United States. You put a spotlight on this issue in a way that it has never been before. And that is creating a new X factor.\u201d Still, he vowed to try: \u201cWe hear you. We hear what you\u2019re saying and we will redouble our efforts.\u201d Thunberg was one of several youth activists invited to address the task force during two days of action and speeches aimed at urging lawmakers to support \u201ctransformative climate action\u201d. She was joined by activists from across the US and South America, part of a \u201cmultiracial, intergenerational\u201d effort to combat climate change. The meetings and speeches in Washington are intended to raise awareness ahead of a global climate strike on Friday in which students and workers will walk out of schools and offices to pressure their governments to act as world leaders gather in New York for the annual United Nations summit. \u201cThe generation of the Green New Deal will not only survive but we will thrive,\u201d said Nadia Nazar, co-founder of the advocacy group Zero Hour, at a news conference earlier on Tuesday. \u201cWe will no longer be known as the kids fighting the apocalypse. We will be known as the solution to the climate crisis.\u201d In the US, support for sweeping action on climate change is polarized. Many Republicans \u2013 among them Donald Trump \u2013 are still openly skeptical of the science behind global warming. Republican leaders have mocked Democrats for introducing a Green New Deal and have used the proposal as a cudgel against lawmakers and presidential candidates. The Green New Deal is an ambitious 14-page resolution that calls for a \u201c10-year national mobilization\u201d that would eliminate the nation\u2019s emissions in one decade. Scientists say limiting warming to 1.5C would require cutting manmade carbon levels by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero around 2050. Markey said their movement is shifting the political landscape. The senator pointed to the 2020 presidential debates as evidence of what has changed. Candidates are being asked about climate change and pushed to introduce plans to combat global warming. This is in stark contrast to 2016. \u201cWhat has happened? You have happened,\u201d he told the activists. \u201cYou are giving this extra level of energy to the political process that is absolutely changing the dynamics of politics in the United States.\u201d The 2020 election, Markey said, will in many ways be a \u201creferendum on climate change\u201d. Thunberg arrived in the US after crossing the Atlantic on a solar-powered yacht. She rose to international prominence after launching \u201cFridays for Future\u201d: student-led strikes that have spread to 135 countries. She has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. On Monday, she met Barack Obama. The former president shared a photo from their meeting, in which he praised Thunberg as \u201cone of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates\u201d and someone who is \u201cunafraid to push for real action\u201d. Later on Tuesday, the group was scheduled to meet Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal in the House. On Wednesday, Thunberg will deliver what has been billed as a \u201cmajor address\u201d to members of Congress.",

      "bodyText": "Phil shocked to meet the end of the road- he was undeniably good in previous weeks. Sherlock Gnomes couldn\u2019t have seen it coming. Lemon entry, Indian goodbye. Michael fell from grace something spectacular, Rosie let her cakes do the talking thank god, and Steph kept a ravening David at bay. He\u2019s a very strong contender though. Thanks to all of you for the excellent company and innuendo watch. If any of you would like to hang out with notorious cake perv Felicity Cloake this Sunday you can! Or with me anytime, on the angry jokes place or the boasty picture place. Or if you want to make every cell in my body vibrate like it\u2019s been colonised by bees, buy my book! Ciao, my lonesome and very quarrelsome heroes x Dora did an explore in EXCELLENCE. Grew very fond of Steph this week. Emotional scenes as Phil gets the boot. A bear hug from Paul. The right decision, but it was tight. \u201cLet\u2019s not dwell on Henry\u2019s balls.\u201d Sandi\u2019s back! Maybe she was teste-ing our loyalty what a perv Was that Habito mortgage advert conceptualised by Francis Bacon? Harrowing. I\u2019m finding the contestant\u2019s varying levels of robustness quite fascinating. What do we all think then? Who\u2019s going? Everyone has done well except Phil\u2019s Indian allotment. \u2018Chemical and samey\u2019 is not the best feedback. Ooh, Michael has saved himself hasn\u2019t he? Pulled it outta the bag. Priya looks far less secure. Henry makes a \u201cYou\u2019d eat it as a prisoner maybe\u201d self-deprecating joke. What a lovely young man. Dispiriting to realise I\u2019ve become someone who says \u2018lovely young man.\u2019 These are gloriously vibrant to look at aren\u2019t they. Helena\u2019s biscuit spoons go down a treat. Rosie classy as ever. Michelle\u2019s tart of rice confuses Paul. David\u2019s mishti also excellent though. Beautiful as always. Hmm. Steph\u2019s Pink Panther hot dogs impress. Hurrah! Plus the ep\u2019s innuendo count was low, until she slipped one in We want Steph to win, yes? @emilyscatnaps you\u2019re so right Ganesha would LOVE Tangfastics. He\u2019d spear them on his tusks. That looks really good,\u201d says Rosie, in response to Phil\u2019s confusing patch of soil with a gnome on it. Awful, awful business. Michelle has produced some sort of Versailles Palace scaffold structure from nowhere Michael helps Priya plate up her puddings, and the friendship is restored. (Indian) sweet! He pours a load of unset nutty runnel onto the board. It honestly looks like dog slop. Not only does size matter, Henry\u2019s kulfi bars aren\u2019t as hard as he\u2019d like them to be. Phil what the hell are you doing Like a nonplussed baby bear Steph makes a \u2018size matters\u2019 joke at Henry and he responds with the most Aardman Animation face I have ever seen. I was standing on the back step, staring into space and thinking \u2018my garden looks a little bit nice.\u201d This is low-level, incredibly weird behaviour from Phil. My mum does a great Indian rice pudding. Rice pudding in a tart case, a la Michelle, is quite weird though. Noel is talking to an empty sack and pretending it\u2019s Sandi. I think she\u2019s not on set. Wonder what was going on. Why are they telling us the freezer needs to be cold to make ice cream? You\u2019d assume it would. Nothing...bad is going to happen to Henry, is it? COME ON YOU COYA (bin leaves) Steph or David? Who do we think will win? Who do we like more? In solidarity with Michael, a lot of Indian sweets are insanely sweet. Your teeth shoot out the top of your head on first contact Lychee, Saffron and Mango are my flavours. I want whatever Priya is making. All I have is an apricot. Henry has very long limbs doesn\u2019t he? Like a pipe cleaner man. It\u2019s his first day being a real boy Coming to Dreamworks, Jan 2020 I love a mishti doi. They sell them on street corners in India. Lovely little earthenware pots full of baked sweet yoghurt. Sublime. Or his actual wife. Noel switches his uxorious inclinations to Sandi, but solely for the purposes of a \u201cmishti eyed\u201d pun. All the enthusiasm of Morrissey in a sports bar. Helena doesn\u2019t need to worry. Play mishti for me I wonder if Paul will set the technical challenge in Mandarin next week. And rig the tent with explosives. @sweetiepudding welcome to you on your Air Canada flight! Must be a first. What\u2019s it like in the cloud? Do you have all my backed up text messages from when I switched phones? (Also the er, pictures. I can explain.) \u201cCertainly the best of this lot.\u201d Steph finishes least last. A sort of Theresa May victory. The other bakes are ALL consigned to the dustbin. Where I shall finish them later. Don\u2019t encourage them, Prue.\u201d Imagine being Paul\u2019s child. That must be rough (puff). Paul doesn\u2019t even look at Priya\u2019s offering! Admittedly it does look like a plate of whatever the foxes didn\u2019t fancy from the bin. Again, I can\u2019t talk Someone\u2019s woken up on the wrong side of his enclosure \u201cThey\u2019re awful. They\u2019re really bad,\u201d announces Paul the First, before he\u2019s tasted a single maid. He may well throw young prince Henry into a tower. My gut feel is that I\u2019m not going to be first.\u201d Priya very funny as she pulls actual lentils out of her underbaked pastry. Do we still love Michael? Bit of testiness from Priya to Michael? As he\u2019s feeling much better about this round but now she\u2019s the one who needs support. Priya is having a mare. Rosie seems on top of it? Forgetting \u2018to put water in\u2019 sounds like a pretty basic error Helena. But I have eaten salad leaves from a bin, so not well placed to judge It\u2019s Priya and Helena in a race to the soggy bottom Scant instructions. The bakers have been left to make the curds, their whey. Sandi is having quite a shocking day, humour wise. Sacrilege I know. Maybe she\u2019s tired. Ooh, I love a ruff puff so much. (I believe there\u2019s an app for that.) Noel has gone from the weird outsider newbie to sort of the heart of the show, hasn\u2019t he? We are on SOGGY BOTTOM ALERT. The one week I forgot to do a Bingo too. This sounds like actually, literally impossible to make. If Paul finds a heir in the crumble, it\u2019s off with their heads Oh Michael is a sensitive self-punisher. I feel so sorry for him. As do all the other contestants. I adore Henry\u2019s monologue style, self-doubting but cheerful, doubling back on itself. MichaelOwengelo\u2019s David It\u2019s very neat and beautiful, says Prue, talking about David\u2019s face I think. Patty Simcox and her pretty poppyseed pudding Henry and Rosie nail their dairy element, and Paul slips a vial of booze in Prue\u2019s pocket. Not a euphemism. For a mad woman you\u2019re doing well.\u201d Prue is one rung below a Wodehousian aunt, isn\u2019t she. Yesss. Rosie has smashed it too. Sorry, gone very laddy, not sure why. Still feeling vulnerable about that bin salad thing Come on Hezza. RIGHT- when was the last time any of you actually ate something out of the bin? Mine was two days ago. I\u2019m not proud. Even weirder, it was a bag of salad. It was a bad time \u201cDon\u2019t be nice to me, please.\u201d Oh Michael. Painfully relatable. Priya was lovely about it, though. Struggling to look at Noel\u2019s shirt. Is it a Magic Eye print? I think I saw a dolphin Star Baker Michael\u2019s cake has split down the middle, revealing some sort of\u2026parma violet filling? I wasn\u2019t paying attention earlier. I don\u2019t watch much TV. The cake is, in his words, un-rescuable. Nooooooo PURE DRAMA as Michelle carefully extracts her bundt, taking care not to rip the fragile cake. And promptly smashes the cake stand instead. It\u2019s not not funny. These are bundt tins right? Have they not heard of greasing the inside? Not a problem. Noel just laughing at Sandi\u2019s mild \u201cdairy dallying\u201d wordplay Michelle has more fruit and veg on her cake than I have in my entire house right now. Damn goat, telling me to talk about Lorca. \u201cPeople love a theatrical reference, baaaby\u201d he bleated. Shouldn\u2019t have trusted him. I just want to be down with the kids. Wow, what an alienating reference point Helena and Noel announce their plans to divorce their partners and run off together. Imagine that blood-red honeymoon. Like a Lorca play. Still not over Sandi and Dave licking a plate of limoncello like cats. Lightly dusted with lesbian jokes. What a show. Thanks! I\u2019m here for an hour or so. I thought a cultured dairy was one where the goats have opinions on the Mercury Music Prize. Priya\u2019s choc and banana cake. I want to go to there. Paul looks sceptical however. It\u2019s good for the microbiome.\u201d My gut tells me I do not want to be sat next to David at a dinner party. Too much complex dairy, or multiculturalism, will unbalance the integrity of the cake.

Although the Spanish socialist party (PSOE), led by the acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, won the most votes five months ago, it fell well short of a majority in the country\u2019s 350-seat congress. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s efforts to form a government were hobbled by the refusal of the centre-right Citizens party to countenance a pact with the PSOE and by the socialists\u2019 own firm veto on entering into a coalition with the far-left, anti-austerity alliance Unidas Podemos. On Tuesday night, after two days of talks with party leaders, King Felipe announced that he would not be putting forward a candidate to stand as prime minister as none was likely to win an investiture debate in congress. Barring any breakthroughs, parliament is expected to be dissolved on Monday and a general election held on 10 November. Speaking at a press conference after the king\u2019s announcement, S\u00e1nchez sought to put the blame for the new elections firmly on his political opponents and appealed to Spaniards to back the PSOE once again in November. \u201cIt has been impossible to fulfil the mandate given to us by the Spanish people on 28 April,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no majority in congress that guarantees the formation of a government, which pushes us to a repeat election on 10 November.\u201d He accused Citizens, the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and Unidas Podemos of \u201cchoosing to block the formation of a government that the Spanish people demanded at the ballot box\u201d, but said he hoped voters would again rally to what called the PSOE\u2019s \u201cprogressive path\u201d. The Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, accused S\u00e1nchez of making \u201can error of historic proportions\u201d and said the acting prime minister did not understand the nature of multi-party politics. Pablo Casado, who leads the PP, said: \u201cWe suspect that what S\u00e1nchez wanted wasn\u2019t to form a government but to hold [another] election. I hope that if there is an election, he doesn\u2019t get off too easily.\u201d Recent polls have suggested the socialists would again finish first, but would again fail to secure a majority. They predict the PP would finish second, picking up more seats than in April, while Citizens is expected to fare very badly, losing between 19 and 23 seats. On Monday, Citizens\u2019 leader, Albert Rivera, had appeared to thaw on his bitter opposition to helping S\u00e1nchez back into office. Rivera offered his party\u2019s abstention in any forthcoming investiture debate if the PSOE promised not to increase taxes, ruled out pardoning the 12 Catalan leaders on trial for their role in the 2017 attempt at winning independence and rejected the support of secessionists in the Navarra region. S\u00e1nchez said his party was already fulfilling the conditions and called on Rivera to end the impasse and avoid another election being called. However, a telephone conversation between the two leaders on Tuesday morning failed to bridge the divide. In a tweet after the call, Rivera wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve just spoken to Pedro S\u00e1nchez. His response to the solution we\u2019re proposing from the opposition is a denial of reality and an attempt to trick the people of Spain. I ask him to put things right, return to constitutionality and allow the end of the impasse in Spain.\u201d Spain\u2019s traditional two-party system has been thrown into chaos in recent years by the emergence of Podemos and Citizens, which have challenged the longstanding primacy of the PSOE and the PP. The PP\u2019s dominance of the right has been eroded by the Citizens\u2019 drift to the right and by the arrival of the far-right Vox party. Recent years have also been eventful for the socialists. S\u00e1nchez was forced from the helm of the PSOE in October 2016 after powerful factions within the party rebelled against his refusal to allow the PP, led by the then acting prime minister Mariano Rajoy, to form a government. S\u00e1nchez made a triumphant return a few months later and managed to turf Rajoy\u2019s government out of office last year using a no-confidence vote amid growing public anger over corruption scandals. Matters have been further complicated by the Catalan independence crisis. Although S\u00e1nchez has taken a more conciliatory approach to the issue than Rajoy \u2013 who used the constitution to take control of the region \u2013 he has flatly refused to allow an independence referendum. In February this year, the two main Catalan pro-independence parties punished S\u00e1nchez by joining forces with their enemies in the PP and Citizens to torpedo the PSOE\u2019s national budget, triggering April\u2019s election.",

      "bodyText": "The Japanese company behind the pawnbroker Albemarle &amp; Bond pulled the plug on the business amid concern that its losses would increase after Brexit, it has emerged, shedding light on the mysterious closure of its 113 shops last week. Albemarle &amp; Bond and its sister company Herbert Brown pulled down their shutters without warning last Friday, leaving customers concerned that they may never retrieve their belongings, pawned for short-term cash. The Tokyo-based parent company Daikokuya Holdings has so far offered no update to customers on the future of Speedloan Finance, the UK subsidiary that owns the two pawnbroking brands and employs nearly 400 staff. But in a statement issued to investors in Japan, it said: \u201cSince acquiring Speedloan Finance in October 2014, the company [Daikokuya Holdings] has been working to improve its management. \u201cHowever, despite the implementation of various measures to improve management such as moving the head office, flattening the organisation, and reducing the number of employees, the net profit for the year ended 31 March 2019 was a deficit of \u00a37m. \u201cMoreover given the increased likelihood that the UK will leave the EU, losses are expected to increase, so we have decided to withdraw from the UK business.\u201d Daikokuya, which does not appear to have published any explanation of its decision in English, said it was now seeking a buyer for the company\u2019s assets and had begun a voluntary redundancy problem for its nearly 400 staff. The company has not responded to requests from the Guardian for comment. In the aftermath of the closures, Speedloan Finance was criticised for \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d communication with customers hoping to get their belongings back. The National Pawnbrokers Association (NPA), the UK trade body of which Albemarle &amp; Bond is a member, said it was receiving hundreds of calls a day from worried customers who had been unable to get through to a helpline set up by the pawnbroker. Ray Perry, NPA chief executive, said there were only 10 people working in Albemarle &amp; Bond\u2019s contact centre and they had been overwhelmed by demands for information.

Netanyahu\u2019s attempts in May failed after ally-turned-rival, Avigdor Lieberman, refused to join the coalition government unless the prime minister agreed to reign in Jewish ultra-Orthodox politicians. Lieberman, a staunch secularist, has seen his popularity spike and he could come out of the election as a kingmaker.

Inside Israel, Palestinian citizens make up close to a fifth of the 9 million population, although many boycott elections. This year, Arab parties ran under a single alliance in an attempt to raise their joint influence. As in previous elections, Netanyahu has ramped up anti-Arab rhetoric to appeal to the far right. Last week, Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on his official page for breaching the company\u2019s hate speech policy after it warned of Arabs who \u201cwant to destroy us all\u201d.

The lawsuit alleges that Snowden published without submitting the book to the agencies for pre-publication review, \u201cin violation of his express obligations under the agreements he signed\u201d.

      "body": "<p>A teenage Eritrean refugee was the fourth from his friendship group to take his own life after arriving in the UK, an inquest hearing has revealed.</p> <p>Mulubrhane Medhane Kfleyosus, 19, was found dead on 18 February 2019 in Milton Keynes. It is the fourth death in the space of 16 months among one friendship group of unaccompanied young male Eritrean asylum seekers and refugees.</p> <p>Osman Ahmed Nur, 19, was found dead on 10 May 2018 in a communal area of a young people\u2019s hostel in Camden, north London. Two of Osman Ahmed Nur\u2019s friends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/17/suicides-raise-alarm-about-uk-treatment-of-child-refugees-eritrean\">took their lives</a> in London just months before he did. Filmon Yemane had recently turned 18 when he killed himself in November 2017. Alexander Tekle, also 18, took his own life a fortnight later, in December, a year after he had arrived in the UK hidden in the back of a refrigerated lorry.</p> <p>These tragic young deaths have highlighted the extreme challenges and traumas faced by young, unaccompanied asylum seekers forced to flee their countries and make hazardous journeys across continents alone. It illustrates how arrival in a safe country like the UK is not the end of their problems.</p> <p>Coroner Tom Osborne, sitting at Tuesday\u2019s hearing in Milton Keynes coroner\u2019s court, asked the legal teams for Kfleyosus and for Milton Keynes social services, an interested party in the case, to make written submissions about whether the inquest should look at the role of the state in the teenager\u2019s death rather than just the circumstances of it.</p> <p>Kfleyosus\u2019s family want the scope as broad as possible, while Milton Keynes social services argued that it should be narrower.</p> <p>Paul Clark, the barrister for Kfleyosus\u2019s family, said that two of the coroners examining other deaths in this friendship group of young Eritrean refugees were communicating about common issues with these deaths.</p> <p>At the inquest into Ahmed Nur\u2019s death in August, coroner Mary Hassell directed the London borough of Camden \u2013 where he died \u2013 to alert other local authorities of the increased risk of suicide among young unaccompanied Eritrean asylum seekers.</p> <p>Helen Johnson, the head of the <a href=\"https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/our-work/\">Refugee Council</a>\u2019s children services, said: \u201cThere is nothing more heartbreaking than learning that a young person has beaten the odds and survived unimaginable hardship in their home country, endured an utterly perilous journey to the UK, only to take their own life once finally safe here.\u201d</p> <p>The charity works with many unaccompanied child asylum seekers and refugees.</p> <p>\u201cOther issues are also at play here,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur asylum system sees people waiting months, even years for a decision on their asylum claim, leaving them in utter limbo, unable to move on.

      "bodyText": "A teenage Eritrean refugee was the fourth from his friendship group to take his own life after arriving in the UK, an inquest hearing has revealed. Mulubrhane Medhane Kfleyosus, 19, was found dead on 18 February 2019 in Milton Keynes. It is the fourth death in the space of 16 months among one friendship group of unaccompanied young male Eritrean asylum seekers and refugees. Osman Ahmed Nur, 19, was found dead on 10 May 2018 in a communal area of a young people\u2019s hostel in Camden, north London. Two of Osman Ahmed Nur\u2019s friends took their lives in London just months before he did. Filmon Yemane had recently turned 18 when he killed himself in November 2017. Alexander Tekle, also 18, took his own life a fortnight later, in December, a year after he had arrived in the UK hidden in the back of a refrigerated lorry. These tragic young deaths have highlighted the extreme challenges and traumas faced by young, unaccompanied asylum seekers forced to flee their countries and make hazardous journeys across continents alone. It illustrates how arrival in a safe country like the UK is not the end of their problems. Coroner Tom Osborne, sitting at Tuesday\u2019s hearing in Milton Keynes coroner\u2019s court, asked the legal teams for Kfleyosus and for Milton Keynes social services, an interested party in the case, to make written submissions about whether the inquest should look at the role of the state in the teenager\u2019s death rather than just the circumstances of it. Kfleyosus\u2019s family want the scope as broad as possible, while Milton Keynes social services argued that it should be narrower. Paul Clark, the barrister for Kfleyosus\u2019s family, said that two of the coroners examining other deaths in this friendship group of young Eritrean refugees were communicating about common issues with these deaths. At the inquest into Ahmed Nur\u2019s death in August, coroner Mary Hassell directed the London borough of Camden \u2013 where he died \u2013 to alert other local authorities of the increased risk of suicide among young unaccompanied Eritrean asylum seekers. Helen Johnson, the head of the Refugee Council\u2019s children services, said: \u201cThere is nothing more heartbreaking than learning that a young person has beaten the odds and survived unimaginable hardship in their home country, endured an utterly perilous journey to the UK, only to take their own life once finally safe here.\u201d The charity works with many unaccompanied child asylum seekers and refugees. \u201cOther issues are also at play here,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur asylum system sees people waiting months, even years for a decision on their asylum claim, leaving them in utter limbo, unable to move on. Many children are also forced to go through the trauma of having their age disputed, which can see them deprived of the vital services they desperately need as children and in accommodation entirely unsuitable to their age.\u201d The Children\u2019s Society produced a report in June 2018 which highlighted how the daunting and bewildering experience many of these children go through can have detrimental effects on their mental health. The full inquest into Kfleyosus\u2019s death has been scheduled for March 2020. A pre inquest review hearing into the death of Tekle takes place at Westminster coroners\u2019 court on Friday, while Ahmed Nur\u2019s inquest is part-heard and is due to resume in November.

Somerset then reduced Hampshire to 10 for three before James Vince stepped into his big spoiling boots, and hit his first red-ball century of the season \u2013 giving <strong>Hampshire</strong> a lead of 230 at the Ageas Bowl with two wickets in hand.</p> <p>Meanwhile, chasers-in-chief <strong>Essex</strong> clawed back against <strong>Surrey</strong> at Chelmsford. Sam Cook and Jamie Porter pocketed five wickets each as last year\u2019s champions were dismissed for 174. Jordan Clark then snaffled three quick wickets until 147 from Dan Lawrence and 74 not out from Ryan ten Doeschate stretched Essex\u2019s first-innings lead to 128.</p> <p>After <strong>Kent</strong> had declared overnight at Headingley, <strong>Yorkshire</strong> stumbled to 216, a deficit of 217, and that despite six dropped catches. <strong>Warwickshire\u2019s </strong>Dominic Sibley did his chances of winter tour selection no harm with his fourth championship century of the summer, against <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> at a featherbed Trent Bridge.</p> <p>In the Division Two promotion race, <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> bowled out <strong>Worcestershire</strong> for 128 at New Road. But a late stumble left them 54 for four at the close, needing another 61 to win. <strong>Sussex</strong> had a chastening day at Derby after Luis Reece and Billy Godleman (106 not out) put on 274 for the first wicket for <strong>Derbyshire</strong>; Reece was run out on 184.</p> <p><strong>Northamptonshire</strong> dismissed <strong>Durham</strong> for 131 by lunch at Wantage Road, Ben Sanderson finishing with six for 54, and thanks to fifties from Adam Rossington and Richard Levi, built an overwhelming lead. <strong>Glamorgan</strong> kept their dreams just about alive, finishing a wicket away from forcing <strong>Leicestershire</strong> to follow on at Sophia Gardens.</p> <p>And at Old Trafford <strong>Middlesex</strong> produced an eye-rubbing turnaround, after starting the day bow-legged at 39 for six. A career-best 167 from ex-<strong>Lancashire</strong> academy graduate John Simpson, and plucky supporting roles, gave them a first-innings lead.

Somerset then reduced Hampshire to 10 for three before James Vince stepped into his big spoiling boots, and hit his first red-ball century of the season \u2013 giving Hampshire a lead of 230 at the Ageas Bowl with two wickets in hand. Meanwhile, chasers-in-chief Essex clawed back against Surrey at Chelmsford. Sam Cook and Jamie Porter pocketed five wickets each as last year\u2019s champions were dismissed for 174. Jordan Clark then snaffled three quick wickets until 147 from Dan Lawrence and 74 not out from Ryan ten Doeschate stretched Essex\u2019s first-innings lead to 128. After Kent had declared overnight at Headingley, Yorkshire stumbled to 216, a deficit of 217, and that despite six dropped catches. Warwickshire\u2019s Dominic Sibley did his chances of winter tour selection no harm with his fourth championship century of the summer, against Nottinghamshire at a featherbed Trent Bridge. In the Division Two promotion race, Gloucestershire bowled out Worcestershire for 128 at New Road. But a late stumble left them 54 for four at the close, needing another 61 to win. Sussex had a chastening day at Derby after Luis Reece and Billy Godleman (106 not out) put on 274 for the first wicket for Derbyshire; Reece was run out on 184. Northamptonshire dismissed Durham for 131 by lunch at Wantage Road, Ben Sanderson finishing with six for 54, and thanks to fifties from Adam Rossington and Richard Levi, built an overwhelming lead. Glamorgan kept their dreams just about alive, finishing a wicket away from forcing Leicestershire to follow on at Sophia Gardens. And at Old Trafford Middlesex produced an eye-rubbing turnaround, after starting the day bow-legged at 39 for six. A career-best 167 from ex-Lancashire academy graduate John Simpson, and plucky supporting roles, gave them a first-innings lead. Middlesex\u2019s 337 was a world record score for any side who had lost their first six wickets for less than 40. Well James Vince has truly thrown everything into the mix with his first championship century of the season. Twenty-three balls to get off the mark, then 14 gorgeous, sumptuous, you-name- it boundaries. Fiend! And Dan Lawrence keeping Essex well and truly in the running with 147. Gloucestershire having a stumble to be resolved in the morning, and Northants looking good against Durham. Middlesex performing miracles from the carnage of 34-6. That\u2019s it from me for tonight - the sun is setting and it is getting a bit dark to ride home. Have a lovely evening. Good night! And with this match on the brink of a turn-about, I\u2019d better write up... with Luis Reece run-out for 184; Dan Lawrence on the brink of his century at Chelmsford (Essex lead by 44); a quick-step James Vince 68 bouldering Hampshire to an 182-run lead against Somerset; a Dom Sibley century at Trent Bridge; collapsing Yorkshire half-rescued by Fisher; Leicester in trouble, Durham in trouble, Gloucester on the way. Davies tries to pull Cummins off his fourth ball and is caught by Harris on the fine-leg boundary. Lancashire 1/0. I\u2019m not saying this is a Lancs-up. And Lancashire\u2019s long day in the field comes to an end when Ethan Bamber has a swish and top-edges to Keaton Jennings. John Simpson, a career-best 167 not out, removes his helmet and turns to acknowledge the applause coming from all round the ground. What a smashing knock. (Bailey 5-78; Parkinson 3-49) Lancashire have, we think, seven overs to bat today in the evening sunshine, and a deficit of 78. Not what they were expecting when they hauled their tired bodies up the Old Trafford stairs this morning. Now they can look forward to sharp little spells from Cummins and Roland-Jones. Hampshire have lost another, 90/7 - a lead of 144. Can they eek it out to 200? Somerset won\u2019t want to chase any more. Gloucestershire 115 to win at New Road. I tipped Dillon Pennington last year - maybe this is his match. If Gloucestershire win, they have nearly, nearly, nearly screwed the spikes into their Division One boots. In fact if Durham and Sussex lose, the promotion places are as good as filled. Sibley (83*) and Hain (45*) have now put on 83 on what I\u2019m guessing is a featherbed at Trent Bridge - Warwicks 206-6. And what do you say about Derbyshire? Scuppering Sussex with a opening partnership of 245 - a lead of 153. Luis Reece an incredible 164 off 165 balls - 30 fours, and Godleman 68 off 115 balls Yorkshire\u2019s efforts to finish the season with a whimper going well. Now 201-7, 281 behind. Milnes 4-61. Bresnan top-scorer with 39, till this... Hampshire 45 for six! Two wickets each for Gregory, Coverton and Davey! Vince still there .... a Hampshire lead of 99. And that\u2019s the record! This is the highest ninth-wicket partnership by Middlesex against Lancashire, beating that jointly held by John Murray and Fred Titmus at Lord\u2019s in 1974, and Hugh Bromley-Davenport and Cyril Wells at Lord\u2019s in 1896. Dan Lawrence holding Essex\u2019s hopes together at Chelmsford with 51 not out. Bopara morkelled in the first over after tea. Apologies - premature announcement - This is NEARLY the highest ninth-wicket partnership by Middlesex against Lancashire, currently 83 jointly held by John Murray and Fred Titmus at Lord\u2019s in 1974, and Hugh Bromley-Davenport and Cyril Wells at Lord\u2019s in 1896. A cheeky 20-minute potter around outside. A handful, perhaps a good scattering, of supporters taking advantage of the really quite warm northern sunshine. Shirts and caps rather than anoraks and woolly hats. Trams rattling past, friendly murmurings - though not so friendly about Lancashire\u2019s day. Sowter proving a more than adequate foil for Simpton with five crashing fours in his 38. Simpson reached a career best 144 with a drive to deep-cover. And Middlesex now lead by 29, Rutherford\u2019s run-out leaves Worcestershire to crack on with just the tail 72/7. Northants 102-4, a lead of nearly 200 v Durham; three wickets for Samit Patel as Leicestershire fold for the penultimate match this year -93/5; Derbyshire\u2019s openers plough on -149-0- in what is a must-win for Sussex; and it is tea here at Old Trafford where John Simpson has guided Middlesex to within seven runs of Lancashire. Time for a quick cuppa and a circuit of the ground. Stats for the ages. And lo it came to pass that Gregory and Davey were full of fire and did steam in and Hampshire were 14-3 in the tenth over, a lead of just 68. Reece and Godleman laughing in the faces of Robinson, Jordan, Wiese and Topley - Derby 104-0, deficit erased, game on. Leicestershire 86-2; Azad still there, 27 not out. Salisbury and Raine putting the pressure on Northants - 65-4- but Northants already lead Durham by 151. Worcestershire sink further, 49-6, and here Middlesex trail by just 29 - in a textbook account of all not being lost until the fat lady sings final digit is raised. An email! Thank you to Matt Cast for digging into his memory banks for this gem of information. \u201cI\u2019m sure someone will have pointed this out already, [I don\u2019t think they have!] but the Hampshire v Somerset match is setting up rather like their match in September last year a low-scoring scrap with seam bowlers and particularly Kyle Abbot to the fore (not a single over of spin in last year\u2019s game!). Hampshire have got a similar lead to the one they got last year and unfortunately I suspect the result will be similar...\u201d \u201cThat game last year was my first (and only, so far) time ever watching county cricket and it was quite an exciting one with the clatter of wickets and a 50 from one of my favourite players, Marcus Trescothick, although I\u2019d have preferred a different result!\u201d What a treat to see Trescothick score runs in the autumn of his career. That could well have been his last fifty for Somerset? Oh Worcestershire, take two. Last year I was sent to New Road to see Surrey clinch the Championship (a game which included 16 homegrown players). Worcestershire gave them a bit of a scare in the chase, and Alec Stewart was full of praise for the young team coming through. \u201cIt is important to have a nucleus of home grown players and that\u2019s why Worcestershire, I really hope they stay up. \u201cI think they have also shown if you produce your own, you fight together. \u201cThey didn\u2019t look a bottom of the table team in this game and they pushed us hard at The Oval as well. \u201cIf you can get your own players, who have come through the system, understand what the club is about, and grow up wanting to play for the club, they can find that little bit more when the going gets tough. \u201cAlso when you win something, it means that little bit more.\u201d This afternoon they sit, 38-5 in their second innings, a lead of a miserly 24, second bottom in the Div 2 table, with three wins to their name. And Gloucestershire, least fancied, back in the chase. Enjoying very much Josh Davey\u2019s reluctance to accept the inevitable here: Kyle Abbott throwing a spanner in the works with nine for 40. Somerset owe much to Dom and co who added 77 for the last two wickets. And with a pull through midwicket, Simpson goes to his first ever hundred against Lancashire, his second of the season and Middlesex\u2019s ninth of a dismal batting Championship summer. To the whirr of the tractor and the glug of the flagon, Bess and van der Merwe have added 53 for the seventh wicket. Somerset reduce the deficit to 70. Oh Worcestershire; losing a wicket with the very first ball of the innings was not the lunch-time plan. Mitchell lbw to David Payne. By the way, the latest groundless HH rumour I can pass on is that he is off New Road. Seems he has plenty of interest anyway, wishing him wisdom in his choice. And Tom Westley, fresh from very-nearly-two-hundreds in the last game, is bowled by the first ball after lunch. Essex 28/2. At Headingley, Yorkshire are 97-4. Milnes joins Stevens in the two-fer club. A wicket for Parky! Smashing ball that spins away and bowls Harris for 32. Middx 141-7, 118 behind. A partnership of 107 that removed Middlesex from life-support. And as they come back on at Old Trafford, the news that the last time Lancashire went unbeaten in Championship was 1974, when they finished eighth, drew 15 games and won five. This is Simpson\u2019s fourth fifty against Lancashire and his highest score. If Lancashire win this game, Lancashire will have a winning record against every team in the Championship except Surrey and Yorkshire. (enough stats, ed.) Division One Headingley: Kent 482-8 dec: (Stevens 237, Billings 138; Olivier 5-108). Yorkshire 80-3. Chelmsford: Surrey 174(S Cook 5-53; Porter 5-62) Essex: 26-1.

Middlesex 132-6 (Simpson 71 not out; Bailey 5-38) Pattonair County Ground: Derbyshire 138: Dal 35; Wiese 4-18 and 1-0. Sussex 231: (Van Zyl 60; Garton 50; Reece 5-63) Wantage Road: Northamptonshire 217: (Rossington 82; Rushworth 5-68, Raine 3-53). Durham 131: (Sanderson 6-54) New Road: Worcestershire 221: Wessels 72; Higgins 4-55, Payne 3-57. Gloucestershire 235: (Barnard 6-42.) Glamorgan 435 (Cooke 95; Wright 5-64) v Leicestershire Middlesex reach lunch without loss - a partnership of 98 between Harris (27) and Simpson (71). That\u2019s not exactly what I was expecting, some cracking mid-September curve balls already this round. Lunchtime scores to follow. Here Livingstone is tonked straight back over his head for six. At Chelmsford, Essex have the w of an \u2018obble -16/1 - Jordan Clark bowling Browne in his first over. And some lovely pictures to browse over your sandwiches. Glamorgan have zooomed past maximum batting points despite Chris Cooke being bowled just four short of his century. Currently 432-8 against the wooden-spoonists. An email arrives: Good morning Tanya Good morning Geoff! Surely the answers to Steve Smith and the flaky English batting were there all along - they simply needed to pick Darren Stevens. Whatever happened to Ed Smith\u2019s hunchometer? Sticking with the Ashes-related, can Glamorgan put in a compensation claim to the Aussies (or indeed to the ECB) for their promotion bid being concussed? That\u2019s a nice idea - though Somerset and Sussex, Surrey and Yorkshire might fancy adding their names to the list too. The Durham and Somerset collapse-off continues. Durham 100-7 (117 behind - Sanderson 5-43); Somerset 81-8 (115 behind - Abbott 7-71). At Old Trafford, PARKY is on, to warm applause. This incredibly strong statement from Ben Stokes. What a pointless and cruel editorial decision. I was doing the washing-up last night with half an ear on Michael Vaughan on the radio. Interested to hear his tour squad for New Zealand- forward planning for the next Ashes - that included Sibley/Crawley, Pope, Archer/Saqib Mahmood, Foakes/Bairstow/Buttler, Curran/Woakes and the assertion that England should only play one of Broad or Anderson at any one time. And Liam Livingstone has been hauled into the attack at the James Anderson end. Middlesex 108-6. And Surrey crumble to 174 all out - losing 6-22 at a most inopportune rate. Time for Morne to have a morning. John Simpson batting very nicely here at OT - wiser heads than me say he was in the very first academy intake at Old Trafford but was let go because they had too many wicket-keepers. Kyle Abbott puts his big boots through the Taunton fairytale. 12-9-11-6. Somerset 59-7. Lancs fans may like to know that the Division Two trophy is motoring up from ECB HQ this very moment and will be presented at the end of this match. We don\u2019t think Colin Graves is driving. Middlesex bring up the fifty partnership in 95 balls and it is as if yesterday evening never happened. 87-6. Meanwhile Somerset self-destruct further - George Bartlett for 9. 58-6 and in the middle of an existential crisis. Essex making up for lost time at Chelmsford - Surrey 159 for seven, Foakes, Clarke and Jacks all snaffled this morning. Somerset relying on Clark and Plunkett to bully the total past 200. So Darren Stevens has now made 237, struggled out of bed, limped down to breakfast, taken the new ball and taken two for four. Yorkshire 17 for 2. Ballance lbw - I don\u2019t need to tell you who to. Somerset have decided that what they really, really want is down to the wire, tension-building cricket - otherwise winning the Championship for the first time in their history doesn\u2019t really count. So they\u2019re now 57-5, 139 behind Hampshire, Bartlett and Gregory trying to desperately stick thumbs in the dyke. September wickets galore. In Division Two Sussex\u2019s day doesn\u2019t get off to the best of starts - two in two from Luis Reece, Delray Rawlins for 34 and Ben Brown first ball (134-5). Glamorgan lose Root and Wagg to Griffiths 330-6; Harris and Simpson have put on Middlesex\u2019s biggest partnership of the innings - 31- in the more welcoming morning sunshine; Durham - what are you doing? - 51 for SIX, Sanderson 5-29 -against Northants. Gloucestershire potter on without incident at New Road - 103-4. Can\u2019t believe how much I missed yesterday - Darren Stevens doing it for 40 year olds everywhere, Lancashire winning the Championship, and Nottinghamshire remembering belatedly, and with the pressure off, how to bat. Here at Old Trafford, I\u2019m told that Middlesex\u2019s batting on Monday evening wasn\u2019t that bad, Tom Bailey was brilliant and a couple of the batsmen - Robson and Cummins - were perhaps a little unfortunate to be walking back to the pavilion.

But for the supreme court to rule against the government \u2013 to side with the Scottish court of session against the English high court \u2013 would amount to a bold act of judicial assertiveness, effectively creating new law curtailing the power of the executive. It could happen, but it would not be normal.</p> <p>Here are the main points from today\u2019s hearing.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lord Keen, who was representing the government, told the court that Boris Johnson would comply with any declaration it made.</strong> The fact that he felt the need to say this is evidence of the extent to which trust in the government to comply with constitutional norms is breaking down. As advocate general for Scotland, Keen is a member of the government, as well as a QC. He told the court:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If this court finds that the advice of the prime minister [to the Queen saying parliament should be prorogued] was unlawful, the prime minister will take all necessary steps to comply with any declaration made by the court.</p> </blockquote> <p>But when asked if that meant parliament would definitely reconvene, Keen said it would be up to the PM to decide. He also refused to rule out the PM requesting a second prorogation, saying again that this would be a matter for Boris Johnson, or the \u201cdecision maker\u201d, as he called him. And when asked if Johnson would allow parliament to meet and pass new emergency legislation if it wanted, in the event of the government losing, Keen replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It must be for the decision maker to consider the declaration made by the court and to ensure that he proceeds lawfully thereafter.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>The court was told that Boris Johnson had abused his power to prorogue parliament more than any PM in the last 50 years. </strong>(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/17/brexit-latest-news-supreme-court-minister-refuses-to-rule-out-boris-johnson-suspending-parliament-again-ahead-of-supreme-court-hearing-live-news?page=with:block-5d80abdb8f08f30dc5bbcd2c#block-5d80abdb8f08f30dc5bbcd2c\">10.50am.)</a> Addressing the court on behalf on behalf of Gina Miller, Pannick said that the government had failed to explain why the prorogation needed to be so long.

At the time the Attlee government wanted to amend this. A bill to amend the act had already been defeated once in the Lords. According to <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8589#fullreport\">a Commons library note (pdf)</a>, this is what happened next.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parliament was first prorogued by commission on 13 September 1948 and a King\u2019s speech was delivered on 14 September 1948. The Commons had ten sitting days (the Lords only five) before parliament was again prorogued by commission on 25 October 1948. A further King\u2019s speech was made on 26 October 1948. </p> <p>The period of prorogation in those instances was unusually short by the standards of the UK parliament (being just one day on both occasions). The second Parliament Act eventually received royal assent in December 1949, just over two years after it first passed second reading in the House of Commons.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Lady Hale</strong> questions this example, saying that this case involve prorogation being used to enforce the will of parliament, not to frustrate it.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T14:13:05.308Z\">at 3.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d80e3298f08f30dc5bbcf92\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T13:45:13.988Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth Jo Swinson has just started her leader\u2019s speech.</p> <p>There is a live feed here.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32PvwpAgXg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m32PvwpAgXg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Jo Swinson\u2019s speech to Lib Dem conference</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d80e0c68f08f30dc5bbcf72\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T13:44:04.333Z\">2.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Keen says the power to prorogue parliament is not there just to allow a Queen\u2019s speech.</p> <p>He says Lord Pannick did not mention <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/30-31/81/contents\">the Prorogation Act 1867</a>.</p> <p>And he says there are times when prorogation has taken place for political purposes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d80dd848f0834740f3bcce1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T13:32:37.008Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM will take 'necessary steps' to comply with any declaration from supreme court, court told</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Keen says he will not accept that the Scottish court of session had the right to declare prorogation null and void.</p> <p>For reference, this is what the Scottish court said in its summary of its judgment:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The court will accordingly make an order declaring that the prime minister\u2019s advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect. </p> </blockquote> <p>Keen says William IV was the last monarch to prorogue parliament in person.</p> <p>Now it is done by a royal commission.</p> <p>He says, under the Bill of Rights, the courts do not have the right to question proceedings in parliament.</p> <p>He says the Scottish court ruling saying prorogation is null and void must be rejected.</p> <p>And he says the PM \u201cwill take all necessary steps to comply with any declaration of the courts\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Lady Hale </strong>says the question of whether prorogation is actually a proceeding of parliament is a matter for the court to decide.

He only quotes briefly from what it says - the judges have the whole thing in their bundle - but here is a passage summarising Elliott\u2019s argument.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Far from requiring the court to determine whether the duration is excessive, the issue in <em>Cherry </em>and <em>Miller (No 2)</em> requires the court only to determine whether, to begin with, prorogation was undertaken for a purpose that was legally impermissible because it lies outside the range of purposes for which the power can lawfully be deployed. This is a crisp question of constitutional law concerning the <em>scope </em>of the discretionary power to prorogue, as distinct from a question about whether discretion has been lawfully exercised. Such a question of law, about the scope of the executive\u2019s legal powers, is manifestly one that lies within the field of matters with which courts can properly deal.</p> <p>The result is that to approach <em>Cherry </em>and <em>Miller (No 2) </em>in terms of whether the courts can stretch the bounds of justiciability in a way that facilitates judicial scrutiny of the exercise of the prorogation prerogative is misconceived. It is misconceived because the legal issue at stake is not one upon which the non-justiciability doctrine can properly bite. That doctrine is concerned with limiting judicial involvement in the evaluation of the exercise of governmental powers whose use is capable of giving rise to questions that are unsuited, under the separation of powers, to analysis by courts on legal grounds. The justiciability doctrine is, however, logically incapable of biting upon questions about whether a given power exists and, if so, what its legal boundaries are. Questions about the purposes for which legal powers can and cannot lawfully be used are legal questions about the scope of such powers. It is questions of precisely that nature which are raised by the <em>Miller (No 2) </em>and <em>Cherry</em> cases. Consequently, the non-justiciability doctrine has no relevant application \u2014 and the suggestion by the divisional court that the \u201cpolitical\u201d nature of the issue shields it from judicial review is entirely wide of the mark. Whether the supreme court will be prepared to treat the matters before it as justiciable remains to be seen, but there is no good legal reason for treating them as non-justiciable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d80c1d28f0834740f3bcbed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T11:24:51.861Z\">12.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Pannick is turning to the third of his three main arguments, relating to justiciability.

This is what that paragraph says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parliament has a second equally important function, namely that of holding the executive to account. The policies and actions of the government are subject to scrutiny in parliament by members of parliament. The United Kingdom operates by a system of representative democracy, and it is members of parliament, representing the interests of their constituents and the wider interests of the country, who are responsible for ensuring that the executive operates in the national interest. In particular, parliament is responsible for ensuring that the policies of the executive are properly considered in a democratic body, and that the actions of the executive are subject to critical scrutiny, with representatives of the government reporting on and explaining those actions. In this way parliament performs the fundamental role of protecting the country from the arbitrary exercise or abuse of executive power. The importance of the latter function is obvious, both in the abstract and in the light of the events during the 17th century that gave rise to the principle of parliamentary sovereignty.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T11:12:38.877Z\">at 12.12pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d80bc368f0834740f3bcbab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T10:58:53.200Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Pannick is still addressing the argument that a power can only be used for its proper purpose.</p> <p>He says, in constitutional terms, ministers are the junior partner.

Reference is made to the fact that the legislative programme for the present session of parliament is nearly at an end, which would provide a valid reason for starting a new session. No attempt is made, however, to explain why a prorogation of five weeks is necessary at a time of acute national controversy. The critical complaint about the prorogation is not the fact that it occurred; short prorogation is regularly used to start new parliamentary sessions. The complaint rather relates to the length of the period during which parliament is to be prorogued, without any power to resume sitting during that period.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T10:12:37.538Z\">at 11.12am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d80ad4d8f08f9df5bdd5dec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T09:55:25.666Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Pannick now reads out the quote.

But that is what he was doing on the Today programme when he refused to rule out Boris Johnson suspending parliament for a second time before the Brexit deadline on 31 October. Asked if it was even \u201cremotely conceivable\u201d that Johnson might suspend (prorogue, to use the technical term) parliament again (MPs are due to return on 14 October), Buckland did not say no. Instead he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, you know, it feels in politics, Harold Wilson said a week is a long time in politics, it seems like an hour is a long time in politics at the moment. For me to sit here and imagine what might happen at the end of October, I think, is idle. What I do know is, if we are able to, we will have a Queen\u2019s speech in mid-October, there will be debate during that time, and a vote as well, perhaps a series of votes.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg yesterday, Johnson himself also refused to rule out suspending parliament again when asked directly to do so.</p> <p>Joe Moor, who was the director of legislative affairs at Downing Street when Theresa May was prime minister, explained in <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/14/boris-johnson-could-still-force-prorogation-second-time1/\">an article in the Sunday Telegraph two days ago (paywall)</a>, that if the government wins the supreme court case starting today, it would be possible for Johnson to suspend parliament again after it returns on 14 October, at least until 6 November. It would have to be sitting on those two days because of an amendment passed to the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act, Moor explained.</p> <p>All of which is why today\u2019s supreme court hearing is so important.</p> <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Owen Bowcott</strong>\u2019s overnight preview story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/16/supreme-court-to-hear-claims-suspension-of-parliament-is-unlawful\">Supreme court to hear claims suspension of parliament is unlawful</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is his analysis of the issues at stake.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/16/supreme-court-hearing-on-suspension-of-parliament-key-issues\">Supreme court hearing on suspension of parliament \u2013 key issues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a live feed of the hearing, so I will be covering it in detail.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from us this evening, so here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events. The big story was in the supreme court. Here\u2019s a comprehensive summary of those proceedings. Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, has said she does not know whether or not Boris Johnson really believes in Brexit. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in [Johnson\u2019s] heart. I don\u2019t know whether he desperately believes in Brexit or he doesn\u2019t believe in Brexit and I\u2019m not going to pretend that I do. But I think people can tell if politicians are basically telling the truth or not and if they can tell if they mean what they say. The prime minister and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, discussed Saudi Arabia, Iran and Brexit in talks this morning. No 10 said they discussed efforts to find a new Brexit deal. And, if you\u2019d like to read more, my colleague Owen Bowcott has the full story: Here are some more details on those comments from Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, who has said the EU is yet to see any written UK proposals for a new Brexit deal. There is an obligation on the party looking for change to come up with solutions that can deal with the consequences of what they are asking for. If that question can\u2019t be answered, we will not have a deal. If the current position from the UK side is that the backstop needs to be removed then it is a perfectly reasonable request by us to say that creates huge problems and how are you going to solve it and what are you going to replace it with? Asked when the public would be informed of where and when checks on the border would take place, he said: First of all, we won\u2019t sign up to any agreement that requires checks with the UK in terms of a permanent trading relationship linked to Brexit. Coveney said any checks would be a \u201ctemporary, emergency measure\u201d to protect Ireland\u2019s place in the single market. He added he would have clarity on the location of the checks before Britain leaves the EU on 31 October. The response to a no-deal Brexit will be checks somewhere. I don\u2019t think they will be near the border. It is not all bad new for Boris Johnson at the moment. According to some new polling from YouGov, his favourability ratings are slightly higher than they were when be became prime minister. Rather, he is slightly less unpopular, because his net score is still negative. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, had frank discussions with the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, outlining the consequences of dropping the backstop over dinner last night. After addressing the cabinet in Dublin again today on Brexit planning, Coveney told reporters: The risk of a no-deal Brexit remains significant as the political situation in London continues to be very uncertain. We and the EU, as underlined by Michel Barnier when I spoke to him yesterday and President Juncker after his meeting with Prime Minister Johnson, are open to a deal. But it must achieve the aims of the backstop through a legally operable solution. We await written proposals from the UK side. We haven\u2019t seen any written proposals to date. He said that if the UK wanted the backstop dropped, it was reasonable that Ireland would spell out the problems with that, especially as it took more than two years of talks to reach that original deal. Just because Boris Johnson says the backstop needs to go does not mean everybody else will respond positively to that because there are consequences. The supreme court prorogation hearing will go on for three days. After day one, who\u2019s winning? I have quoted a couple of commentators brave enough to express a view (see 2.18pm and 4.12pm) but, honestly, no one knows. That is not just because trying to assess how it\u2019s going by following the interventions does not always work. (See 4.35pm) It is because the judges will assess the appeal to a large extent on the quality of the arguments in the paperwork, and most of that is not available to viewers, and did not get aired in court. On the basis of what we did hear, Lord Keen, who was representing the government, was probably less compelling than his opponent, Lord Pannick. But for the supreme court to rule against the government \u2013 to side with the Scottish court of session against the English high court \u2013 would amount to a bold act of judicial assertiveness, effectively creating new law curtailing the power of the executive. It could happen, but it would not be normal. Here are the main points from today\u2019s hearing. Lord Keen, who was representing the government, told the court that Boris Johnson would comply with any declaration it made. The fact that he felt the need to say this is evidence of the extent to which trust in the government to comply with constitutional norms is breaking down. As advocate general for Scotland, Keen is a member of the government, as well as a QC. He told the court: If this court finds that the advice of the prime minister [to the Queen saying parliament should be prorogued] was unlawful, the prime minister will take all necessary steps to comply with any declaration made by the court. But when asked if that meant parliament would definitely reconvene, Keen said it would be up to the PM to decide. He also refused to rule out the PM requesting a second prorogation, saying again that this would be a matter for Boris Johnson, or the \u201cdecision maker\u201d, as he called him. And when asked if Johnson would allow parliament to meet and pass new emergency legislation if it wanted, in the event of the government losing, Keen replied: It must be for the decision maker to consider the declaration made by the court and to ensure that he proceeds lawfully thereafter. The court was told that Boris Johnson had abused his power to prorogue parliament more than any PM in the last 50 years. (See 10.50am.) Addressing the court on behalf on behalf of Gina Miller, Pannick said that the government had failed to explain why the prorogation needed to be so long. And he suggested that Johnson\u2019s refusal to provide the court with a witness statement suggested he had not been telling the truth about his motives for prorogation. Here is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s story about this morning\u2019s proceedings. And this is from the barrister and legal commentator Adam Wagner. During the morning of today\u2019s supreme court hearing, the live stream on the court\u2019s website was accessed 4.4m times \u2013 with 2.8m stream requests being logged in the hour before the 1pm break for lunch, PA Media reports. Typically, the live streaming service is accessed about 20,000 times a month. The European commission has renewed its call for the UK to come up with proposals for an alternative to the backstop. This is what its spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, told a briefing in Strasbourg earlier. We are still waiting for concrete proposals from the UK side. Both sides have stated that they want to have a deal. A no-deal Brexit is in nobody\u2019s interests so clearly there is the willingness to arrive to a solution. But, again, I think we have recalled that it\u2019s now the UK\u2019s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement that are necessary in order to move the discussions forward. Here is one view on the proceedings, from the lawyer and legal commentator Carl Gardner. Keen is winding up now. He says the Scottish judgment should be rejected. And, even if the supreme court endorses what it decides, he says the point about the prorogation currently being null and of no effect (see 2.32pm) should be struck out. And he says he will discuss with Lord Pannick what form of words could be used in any written undertaking by the PM that he will abide by the court\u2019s decision. (See 2.32pm.) And that\u2019s it. The hearing is over for today. I will post a summary soon. Keen says the Scottish court was proceeding on the basis of a misunderstanding of how parliament operates. Making the same point a few minutes ago, he said the Scottish judgment said parliament could reconvene itself at any time during an adjournment. But it cannot, Keen said. During an adjournment, parliament can only be recalled if the government asks for that, he said. Keen quotes from the Scottish court judgment. He reads out this passage. Although the planned prorogation would be 34 days, the expected conference recess of three weeks would mean that only one to three days would be lost in the week commencing 9 September and four in the week commencing 7 October. That makes a total of seven days, Keen says. But he says elsewhere in the judgment the Scottish court says the prorogation amounted to five weeks. He says the five weeks claim is wrong. This passage shows we are only talking about seven days, he says. A judge asks why seven days were needed. Keen does not answer the question directly. Why not seven days, he asks? He says there is no set number of days. Keen says he does not see how the Scottish court could produce an inference of improper motive on the basis of the evidence available to it. A judge asks why the prorogation had to last for five weeks. Keen says that was because it covered the party conference season. He says actually only seven sitting days are being lost. He says the Scottish court, the inner house of the court of session, made a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d in assessing the significance of the length of prorogation. Another judge asks about a Spectator article written by Nikki da Costa on 29 June. It was headlined: \u201cWill parliament be able to stop the next PM leaving without a deal?\u201d The article refers to prorogation as a \u201cnuclear option\u201d. He asks Keen if he is happy for this to be taken in to account. Keen says, when she wrote the article, she was a private individual, not director of legislative affairs at No 10. He says the court could look at all sorts of speculation. But it should consider the evidence submitted by the government, which explains the reasons for what happened, he says. (See 3.32pm.) Keen now quotes from what Boris Johnson said in response to what Nikki da Costa put to him in her memo. (See 3.32pm.) Johnson replied: The whole September session is a rigmarole introduced to show the public that MPs were earning their crust. So I don\u2019t see anything especially shocking about this proposition. Keen says there was correspondence between the government and Gina Miller\u2019s team about the production of documents for the court. He says the government legal department sent a letter saying the documents it had submitted, contemporaneous documents sent to the PM, explained the thinking for prorogation. In the letter, the government lawyers said they had nothing further to add. He says the documents that were produced, quite exceptionally, included a cabinet minute. He quotes from one of the documents \u2013 a memo from Nikki da Costa, director of legislative affairs, to the PM. He reads this out. The current session is the longest since records began, and all bills announced as part of the last Queen\u2019s speech have now received royal assent, or are paused awaiting carry over into the next session: this makes it increasingly difficult to fill parliamentary time with anything other than general debates. As a new prime minister, there is an expectation that you will set out a refreshed domestic programme and it would be natural to do so when the house returns in the autumn. As the first week\u2019s business in September has already been announced, I recommend dedicating the second to wash-up on bills such as R&amp;R [restoration and renewals]. We would then prorogue sometime between the end of Monday 9th September and Thursday 12th September, allowing for the long-standing conference recess, and return on Monday 14th October with the state opening of parliament. A judge asks if the reference to bills being carried over shows that prorogation was being considered at this point. The memo was dated 15 August. Keen says that, at this point after such a long session, it would be normal to think of what is coming next. Keen is now addressing what the Scottish court of session said about Boris Johnson\u2019s motives for prorogation. (This might be the hardest issue for him to address. The government\u2019s claim that it had nothing to do with limiting the opportunities available to MPs to block Brexit is not widely believed.) Keen refers to what Lord Carloway, the lord president of the court of session in Scotland, said in his judgment (pdf) about prorogation. Carloway said \u201cdecisions which are made on the basis of legitimate political considerations alone are not justiciable\u201d. But that raises the questions as to what political considerations are not legitimate, Keen says. He says the Scottish court did not answer this. Back in the supreme court Lord Keen says parliament anticipated this autumn that it would be adjourned after the September sitting. That is why it passed the Benn act quickly, he suggests. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story about Jo Swinson\u2019s speech at the Lib Dem conference. Swinson is still speaking, but the text has been released to reporters in advance. In the supreme court Keen runs through various previous examples of prorogation. And he mentions the prorogation in 1948, which was for a party political purpose. That prorogation took place when the Parliament Act allowed the House of Lords to block a bill for two sessions of parliament. At the time the Attlee government wanted to amend this. A bill to amend the act had already been defeated once in the Lords. According to a Commons library note (pdf), this is what happened next. Parliament was first prorogued by commission on 13 September 1948 and a King\u2019s speech was delivered on 14 September 1948. The Commons had ten sitting days (the Lords only five) before parliament was again prorogued by commission on 25 October 1948. A further King\u2019s speech was made on 26 October 1948. The period of prorogation in those instances was unusually short by the standards of the UK parliament (being just one day on both occasions). The second Parliament Act eventually received royal assent in December 1949, just over two years after it first passed second reading in the House of Commons. Lady Hale questions this example, saying that this case involve prorogation being used to enforce the will of parliament, not to frustrate it. At the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth Jo Swinson has just started her leader\u2019s speech. There is a live feed here. Keen says the power to prorogue parliament is not there just to allow a Queen\u2019s speech. He says Lord Pannick did not mention the Prorogation Act 1867. And he says there are times when prorogation has taken place for political purposes. Keen says he will not accept that the Scottish court of session had the right to declare prorogation null and void. For reference, this is what the Scottish court said in its summary of its judgment: The court will accordingly make an order declaring that the prime minister\u2019s advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect. Keen says William IV was the last monarch to prorogue parliament in person. Now it is done by a royal commission. He says, under the Bill of Rights, the courts do not have the right to question proceedings in parliament. He says the Scottish court ruling saying prorogation is null and void must be rejected. And he says the PM \u201cwill take all necessary steps to comply with any declaration of the courts\u201d. Lady Hale says the question of whether prorogation is actually a proceeding of parliament is a matter for the court to decide. The fact that the royal commission sits in parliament does not make it a proceeding in parliament, in terms of the Bill of Rights. Another judge, Lord Kerr, asks what would happen if the supreme court finds against the government. Keen says he has given \u201ca clear undertaking that the prime minister will respond by all necessary means\u201d to the supreme court\u2019s decision. That would mean parliament sitting again, he implies. Kerr goes again. But is it possible the PM could prorogue parliament again? Keen says he is not able to answer that. That would be a decision for the PM, he suggests. He repeats the assurance he is able to give. If the court finds that the advice of the PM to the Queen about prorogation was unlawful, \u201cthe prime minister will take the necessary steps to comply with any declaration made by it\u201d. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth Keen says the Scottish court accepted that the principle of non-justiciability does apply. What is at stake is whether the decision to prorogue is justiciable. Keen starts by saying he agrees with the inner house of the court of session about this case not hinging on any particular aspect of Scots law. He says in this case the relevant constitution law applies to the UK as a whole. Back in the supreme court the afternoon proceedings are starting. Lord Keen QC, the advocate general for Scotland, is speaking now for the UK government. He is asking the court to reject the judgment of the inner court of Scotland\u2019s court of session. Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, has said she does not know whether or not Boris Johnson really believes in Brexit. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Lorraine, asked about David Cameron\u2019s claim that Johnson only joined the leave campaign to further his own career, she said: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in [Johnson\u2019s] heart. I don\u2019t know whether he desperately believes in Brexit or he doesn\u2019t believe in Brexit and I\u2019m not going to pretend that I do. But I think people can tell if politicians are basically telling the truth or not and if they can tell if they mean what they say. Davidson said that one of the reasons she quit as Scottish Tory leader was because she found it hard to reconcile her political view that, in the light of the referendum result, Brexit should go ahead with her personal opposition to leaving the EU. She also said she did not know why Johnson has prorogued parliament for so long. Asked about this, she said: I think it was done in a bad way but the idea that a prime minister doesn\u2019t suspend parliament in order to bring forward a Queen\u2019s speech and a legislative agenda \u2013 up until recently that happened almost every year. I was quite close to David Cameron and Theresa May, I\u2019m not close to Boris Johnson, I\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019ve ever been part of his inner circle \u2013 I haven\u2019t \u2013 so I don\u2019t know why the government chose to do that and that\u2019s one of the things the judges are going to be deciding, and what the Scottish case looked at. Sir Edward Leigh, the veteran Conservative, has sent an email to MPs explaining why they should vote for him as next Speaker. He would treat them as grown-ups, he says. I would be strictly impartial and deaf to any partisan influence. I would, in quiet dignity, dress, and demeanour, model myself on the present Lord Speaker. We should treat MPs as grown-ups and let them know when they will be called at the beginning of debates. The Speaker must always be scrupulously fair and polite to colleagues, speaking only to effect and briefly and submerge his personality into the role. I would want to be a Speaker who seeks to unite the house in robust scrutiny. A Speaker who speaks only to good and powerful effect and who is the calm, self-effacing voice of the house. Leigh also says he would be in favour of abolishing September sittings \u2013 which might get him Boris Johnson\u2019s vote, in view of the fact Johnson thinks these are an unnecessary \u201cgirly swot\u201d initiative. Wake Up and Vote, a campaign that tried to increase the youth turnout in the EU referendum, has been fined \u00a31,800 by the Electoral Commission for not submitting a full spending return. It said that it spend \u00a366,383 during the campaign. But it also jointly funded an advertising campaign with DDB UK, which cost a total of \u00a375,813, and under electoral rules it should have including the joint spending in its own campaign spending return. Here is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s story about the opening of the supreme court prorogation case. And this is how it starts. Boris Johnson\u2019s motive for proroguing the Commons for five weeks was \u201cto silence parliament for that period\u201d, the supreme court has been told at the opening of an emergency appeal. The prime minister\u2019s extended suspension of debate was carried out for an \u201cimproper purpose\u201d in order to \u201cavoid the risk of parliament undermining the policies of his executive\u201d, said Lord Pannick QC, who was representing the businesswoman and legal campaigner Gina Miller. Before the arguments formally began in central London, Lady Hale, the president of the supreme court, said it was facing \u201cserious and difficult questions\u201d. That was evidenced, she said, \u201cby the fact that three senior judges in Scotland have reached a different conclusion to three senior judges in England and Wales\u201d. Boris Johnson spoke to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, this morning, Downing Street has said. They spoke about Saudi Arabia and Iran, but also about Brexit. According to Number 10, this is what was said on that topic. On Brexit, the prime minister reiterated that the UK and the EU have agreed to accelerate efforts to reach a deal without the backstop which the UK parliament could support, and that we would work with energy and determination to achieve this ahead of Brexit on 31 October. Number 10 said Johnson and Merkel would speak again at the UN general assembly in New York next week. Pannick says, if this issue is not justiciable, people have to ask what might happen if another PM were to prorogue parliament for six months or for a year. And he says it is no good referring to Dicey for guidance on this because he was writing in another era. And Dicey said something like that would be most unconstitutional. Pannick says this is a legal question. And legal questions are for the courts to determine. He says the only remedy he is seeking is a declaration that the PM\u2019s advice was unlawful. He says the government, in its submission, says the PM will comply with the declaration of the court. Pannick concludes by apologising for over-running his time by a few minutes, eating into the time available for lunch. And now the court adjourns until 2pm. Pannick says it is more difficult to apply a Padfield principle to a prerogative power than to a statutory power. But it is still possible, he says. And he says there is an important principle at stake - whether the exercise of such a power frustrates the purposes for which such a power applies. In the supreme court Pannick is winding up. These are from the BBC\u2019s Dominic Casciani and the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said the supreme court case was mentioned by Boris Johnson during this morning\u2019s cabinet meeting. \u201cHe mentioned the fact that the court case was ongoing and that we are confident in our arguments,\u201d the spokesman said. As the Press Association reports, asked whether Johnson should either give evidence or submit an affidavit to the court, the spokesman said: I am not going to comment on an ongoing court case. The way court cases begin is that one side will set out their position and then there will be a response for the government. The court is the right forum for this to take place. Pannick says the PM cannot have discretion as to the depth of the powers he enjoys. Lady Arden says the Fixed-term Parliaments Act allows for prorogation. Pannick says he is not challenging the power of the government to prorogue. But, given the junior role of the executive, he is arguing that it is implicit in the power of the executive that it will not remove the power of scrutiny other than for a legitimate purpose. He says ending one session and starting another is a legitimate purpose. But he says it is not proper to prorogue for so long as to frustrate scrutiny. He says in this case prorogation had the effect of \u201cfrustrating the constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty and supremacy over the executive\u201d. Lord Hodge asks if obtaining political advantage automatically makes a motive improper. Pannick says if the purpose is to prevent scrutiny by the executive, then the purpose is improper. But he says there is nothing wrong with proroguing just to have a Queen\u2019s speech. Pannick quotes from this blog by Prof Mark Elliott, professor of public law the the University of Cambridge. He only quotes briefly from what it says - the judges have the whole thing in their bundle - but here is a passage summarising Elliott\u2019s argument. Far from requiring the court to determine whether the duration is excessive, the issue in Cherry and Miller (No 2) requires the court only to determine whether, to begin with, prorogation was undertaken for a purpose that was legally impermissible because it lies outside the range of purposes for which the power can lawfully be deployed. This is a crisp question of constitutional law concerning the scope of the discretionary power to prorogue, as distinct from a question about whether discretion has been lawfully exercised. Such a question of law, about the scope of the executive\u2019s legal powers, is manifestly one that lies within the field of matters with which courts can properly deal. The result is that to approach Cherry and Miller (No 2) in terms of whether the courts can stretch the bounds of justiciability in a way that facilitates judicial scrutiny of the exercise of the prorogation prerogative is misconceived. It is misconceived because the legal issue at stake is not one upon which the non-justiciability doctrine can properly bite. That doctrine is concerned with limiting judicial involvement in the evaluation of the exercise of governmental powers whose use is capable of giving rise to questions that are unsuited, under the separation of powers, to analysis by courts on legal grounds. The justiciability doctrine is, however, logically incapable of biting upon questions about whether a given power exists and, if so, what its legal boundaries are. Questions about the purposes for which legal powers can and cannot lawfully be used are legal questions about the scope of such powers. It is questions of precisely that nature which are raised by the Miller (No 2) and Cherry cases. Consequently, the non-justiciability doctrine has no relevant application \u2014 and the suggestion by the divisional court that the \u201cpolitical\u201d nature of the issue shields it from judicial review is entirely wide of the mark. Whether the supreme court will be prepared to treat the matters before it as justiciable remains to be seen, but there is no good legal reason for treating them as non-justiciable. Pannick is turning to the third of his three main arguments, relating to justiciability. (See 10.41am.) This is probably the most important aspect of this case. If Pannick cannot convince the supreme court that the PM\u2019s decision to prorogue was justiciable, it will throw out the case, as the high court in London did. Pannick says examples of long prorogations given by the other side in this case relate to the first half of the 20th century, when conditions were very different. A judge puts it to Pannick that, if parliament wanted to hold the government to account in September, it could have held a no-confidence vote. Pannick says the executive is answerable to parliament on matters of politics, and answerable to the courts on matters of law. He says whether or not parliament wanted to hold a no-confidence vote in September is not relevant to the legality of what the PM did. Pannick describes prorogation as a \u201cpre-emptive strike\u201d that \u201ctakes parliament out of the game\u201d for the whole period of prorogation. He says the sovereignty of parliament is the principle underlying the whole constitution. But the PM\u2019s prorogation sought to undermine this sovereignty, he says. Pannick says the junior body in the constitution, the executive, cannot remove the power of the senior partner, parliament, to do its job, particularly when that job is scrutinising the executive. Pannick refers the court to what Lord Drummond Young said about the role of parliament in paragraph 99 of the Scottish judgment (pdf). This is what that paragraph says: Parliament has a second equally important function, namely that of holding the executive to account. The policies and actions of the government are subject to scrutiny in parliament by members of parliament. The United Kingdom operates by a system of representative democracy, and it is members of parliament, representing the interests of their constituents and the wider interests of the country, who are responsible for ensuring that the executive operates in the national interest. In particular, parliament is responsible for ensuring that the policies of the executive are properly considered in a democratic body, and that the actions of the executive are subject to critical scrutiny, with representatives of the government reporting on and explaining those actions. In this way parliament performs the fundamental role of protecting the country from the arbitrary exercise or abuse of executive power. The importance of the latter function is obvious, both in the abstract and in the light of the events during the 17th century that gave rise to the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Pannick is still addressing the argument that a power can only be used for its proper purpose. He says, in constitutional terms, ministers are the junior partner. Parliament is the senior partner, he says. Back to the supreme court, and this is from David Allen Green, the FT\u2019s legal commentator. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Dominic Casciani. Turning away from the supreme court for a moment, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, has been asked to explain to MPs the differences between Operation Yellowhammer documents. As the Press Association reports, Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee, said the papers the committee received described a \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d, whereas a version obtained by the Sunday Times was called a \u201cbase scenario\u201d. He urged Gove to share further documents about no-deal preparations with parliament. In a letter to Gove, Benn wrote: I would be grateful if you could explain why the document we received is entitled the \u2018reasonable worst case scenario\u2019, whereas it has been reported that a very similar if not identical version obtained by the Sunday Times was entitled the \u2018base scenario\u2019. Could you set out and explain any difference between the two documents. Benn also called on Gove to release papers, which he had told the committee he would, about revised assessments for a no-deal Brexit. Here is the text of Benn\u2019s letter. Benn could also have asked Gove why he described the Operation Yellowhammer assessment last week as a \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d, when Boris Johnson, in his article in the Daily Telegraph yesterday (paywall), described it as \u201ca very worst case scenario\u201d. That implies something different. Lady Hale asks which bills were lost during prorogation. Pannick says he will find out. (There is a list here, on the parliament website. Look for the government bills in the 2017-19 session that did not get royal assent, If they did get royal assent, that is indicated by the purple circle with RA on it.) UPDATE: There is a good BBC article on the bills that were lost here. Pannick says the five-week prorogation meant parliament could not legislate during this period, and it could not ask questions of ministers during this period, or hold debates. A judge asked if there was any evidence that questions could not be asked. Pannick says that is how parliament operates; there are no questions during prorogation. He refers the court to a House of Commons briefing paper (pdf). And he reads out this extract from it. During prorogation parliament does not meet. This means that legislation cannot be considered or introduced by MPs and peers. Debates in the chambers or in Westminster Hall are not held, written and oral parliamentary questions cannot be asked, and committees do not carry out their usual business of inquiries and evidence-taking. This temporary suspension of activity is not normally significant, as a new session typically begins shortly thereafter. For a longer prorogation, however, this suspension of activity weakens the ability of parliamentarians to hold the government to account. From the BBC\u2019s Dominic Casciani Pannick is now addressing his second main argument - that it is \u201celementary in public law\u201d that a power can only be used for its proper purpose. He says this principle goes back to the 17th century. And he says this was backed up by a House of Lords judgment in 1968 - the Padfield case. Pannick says this judgment said ministers should not use powers under an act of parliaement to frustrate the purposes of the act. During the day I will be beefing up some of the earlier posts with direct quotes from the Press Association wires. If you want to read them, you may need to refresh the page. Pannick is summing up the first of his three main arguments. (See 10.41am.) He says the PM would not have gone for such a long prorogation if it had not been for his desire to frustrate parliament. This was an \u201cimproper motive\u201d, he says. Pannick says this case \u201ccries out\u201d for an answer from the PM in the form of a witness statement as to why he prorogued parliament. He says, without a witness statement, the court should infer that the desire to frustrate parliament was a factor in prorogation, he says. The courts in addition should be prepared in the circumstances to draw an inference from the absence of any evidence on the government\u2019s side by way of a witness statement. We submit that on all the material the court should conclude that, but for the prime minister\u2019s wish to avoid parliamentary control, he would not have recommended to Her Majesty a prorogation for a period of longer than five weeks, but he would have recommended a substantially shorter period ... as had occurred on every occasion ... in the last 40 years. Pannick says the PM has not made a witness statement giving his reasons for proroguing parliament. He refused, even though his motives were key to this case. Pannick says if the PM had provided a witness statement he would have been open to cross-examination. The production of a witness statement from the prime minister, or indeed anyone else, setting out the reasons for advising on a prorogation as long as five weeks would have had legal consequences. The legal consequences of such a witness statement would have been, almost inevitably, an application to cross-examine. The legal consequences would be that it would be a contempt of court, of course, for such a witness statement not to tell the truth. Our submission is that the documents [before the court] pose more questions than they answer, as the inner house [of the court of session in Scotland] has pointed out, and in any event the production of those documents is no substitute for evidence from the prime minister or someone on his behalf stating to the court in terms why he thought prorogation for the exceptionally long period of five weeks. Pannick says he wants to bring up two additional pieces of evidence that back up the idea that the PM prorogued parliament to frustrate it. He quotes from an interview Boris Johnson gave to Sky News after the prorogation announcement in which he said: The best way to leave with a deal is if our friends and partners over the channel don\u2019t think that Brexit can be blocked by parliament. And Pannick quotes from a BBC interview in which Johnson made the same point. Pannick says he is not interested in whether Johnson was right. He is citing these quotes as evidence of the PM\u2019s motive for proroguing parliament. Pannick says he has finished his introduction. Now he is turning to his first main argument \u2013 the facts of this case. (See 10.41am.) This is the argument that prorogation was designed to frustrate parliament. He says he backs the arguments made by the court of sessions on this. In particular, he refers the judges to this passage from the Scottish judgment. Here is an excerpt from one of the paragraphs in the judgment (pdf) that Pannick refers to. In neither the memorandum nor the prime minister\u2019s comments is any actual reason for the prorogation given other than a desire to begin a new session of parliament with, as is customary, a Queen\u2019s speech in which the government\u2019s legislative programme is set out. Reference is made to the fact that the legislative programme for the present session of parliament is nearly at an end, which would provide a valid reason for starting a new session. No attempt is made, however, to explain why a prorogation of five weeks is necessary at a time of acute national controversy. The critical complaint about the prorogation is not the fact that it occurred; short prorogation is regularly used to start new parliamentary sessions. The complaint rather relates to the length of the period during which parliament is to be prorogued, without any power to resume sitting during that period. Pannick now reads out the quote. Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Today progamme that the Queen had no discretion over prorogation. She had to do as the government advised, Rees-Mogg says. Pannick says he is making no criticism of the Queen in these proceedings. Pannick is now trying to find a quote from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, on the Today programme. But the judges cannot find it in their bundle of court documents, not all of which seem to be marked up in the same way. Pannick quotes paragraph 77 from the government\u2019s case (pdf). It says: There is no authority (domestic or decided in any country operating a Westminster system of government) which supports the proposition that the exercise of a power to prorogue the legislature is amenable to judicial review. Pannick says his case is that what the government is doing is exceptional. He says: No prime minister has abused his power in the manner in which we allege in at least the last 50 years. Pannick says the government has also argued that parliament did sit in September, and will sit again on 14 October. And during the September sitting it legislated, the government has argued (implying that prorogation did not frustrate parliament). But Pannick says it is not for the court to argue what parliament might or might not do when it is sitting. If the PM acted for an improper motive, it is not open to him to say now that his fear was mistaken. He says parliament may wish to impose further obligations on the period up to the EU summit in October. The issues in these proceedings are \u201cvery far from academic\u201d, he says. Pannick says the government has argued that there are legislative provisions that relate to parliamentary sittings, such as the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act. He says these provisions do not invalidate the point that parliament should not be prorogued for an improper motive. Pannick turns to three arguments advanced by the government. The government is arguing that there are no legal rules relating to prorogation, only conventions. Pannick says he is not arguing that prorogation has to last for a maximum amount of time. He says what matters here is intention. And in this case the length of the prorogation suggests that the PM\u2019s motive was to \u201csilence parliament\u201d during this period. Lord Pannick QC is now speaking. He is speaking on behalf of Gina Miller. He says he wants to make three main arguments. First, he says, he is arguing that the prime minister opted for a five-week prorogation to limit the opportunity of parliament to frustrate his government\u2019s policies. Second, he says, he is arguing that it is \u201celementary in public law\u201d that a power can only be used for its proper purpose. That applies to prerogative powers as well, he says. He says for the executive to use a prerogative power to evade the scrutiny of parliament stands the principles of constitutional law on its head. He says he will argue that the government is arguing the \u201cconstitutional novelty\u201d that the powers of the legislature to scrutinise the executive are subject to powers exercised by the executive. And, third, he says, he will argue that the high court was wrong to argue that the decision to prorogue was not justiciable (subject to adjudication by the courts). He says he is not arguing how long prorogation should be. Lady Hale, the president of the supreme court, starts. She says this is a difficult case because senior judges in England and Scotland have reached different conclusions. She says this case will not decide how and when the UK leaves the EU. She says these appeals have been heard at very short notice. As usual, these proceedings are being live-streamed so that anybody who wishes to do so... can watch the arguments as they unfold. This is a very important aspect of open justice and we hope that it will enable many people to understand what these appeals are all about and, just as importantly, what they are not about. The 11 supreme court judges hearing the case are now taking their seats. That means all but one of the 12 judges on the court are here - an indication of how important this case is seen. The supreme court hearing is about to start. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. You can tell the supreme court hearing is important because David Dimbleby has turned up. According to the Press Association, the broadcasting veteran has been speaking to those queuing to get into the court hearing. Dimbleby told PA: I lived through Suez, the miners\u2019 strike, I lived through the poll tax debate and the trouble then. I lived through the Iraq demonstrations - I\u2019ve never seen the country so divided as this ... The prime minister is accused of lying to the Queen \u2013 let\u2019s put it bluntly \u2013 and getting parliament suspended without good reason and that\u2019s big potatoes, it has to be. To make sense of any court hearing, you need to have the relevant paperwork to hand. Here is a guide to the background information you need to make sense of today\u2019s proceedings. A good starting point is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s guide to the issues at stake. Judgments from the lower courts Courts in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already ruled on prorogation and Brexit. Last week the Scottish court of session ruled that prorogation was unlawful. What is really at issue today is whether the supreme court backs this decision or overturns it. Here is a summary of the Scottish judgment. And here is the 68-page full judgment (pdf). But the high court in London rejected a very similar claim, on the grounds that prorogation was a political matter and that it was not for the courts to decide whether or not it was proper. Here is a summary of that high court judgment (pdf). And here is the full judgment (pdf). On Thursday, the high court in Belfast also found in favour of the government, but on a challenge claiming a no-deal Brexit would breach the Good Friday agreement. You can read that judgment here (pdf), but it is not central to the supreme court case. Timetable ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has posted on Twitter a guide to what will be happening when during the three-day supreme court hearing. There is a bit more detail on the court sittings page on the supreme court\u2019s website. Written submissions The supreme court has also published the written submissions from the parties. Here is the 25-page one from Gina Miller (pdf). Here is the 93-page one from Joanna Cherry (pdf). Here is the 46-page one for the prime minister and the advocate general for Scotland (pdf). A revived Stormont assembly could be part of the Brexit solution, the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, has said. In Dublin, where he met the deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, and a delegation from Sinn F\u00e9in, Smith was asked if Stormont would have a say on regulatory alignment on both sides of the border if Brexit talks collapsed. He replied: I think it would be very helpful if the assembly was back up and running. I think there are opportunities through the consent mechanisms from the Good Friday agreement and I think the assembly and executive up and running could be part of that. However, he declined to say whether the mechanism would require consensus from Stormont or a majority vote, which raises concerns that the Democratic Unionist party could block regulatory alignment. He went on: I think you are now drawing me into an area which I am not responsible for. The Brexit negotiations are being led by the prime minister. The Irish government has said a veto for any Stormont party would not be acceptable to the EU. It has also warned that a deal centring on agri-food alignment only would be doomed to failure as it only accounts for 30% of border trade and does not address other political and cultural issues in the backstop. Joanna Cherry, the Scottish National party MP who led the legal challenge against prorogation at the Scottish court of session, told BBC Radio Scotland this morning she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about winning at the supreme court. She said: I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that [the Scottish ruling] will stand. I think that Scotland\u2019s supreme court reached the right decision here for the right reasons and I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that at least a majority of the UK supreme court justices will follow. I think Scotland does have a unique constitutional tradition but I think the way in which Scotland\u2019s supreme court decided this case could easily be followed by the UK supreme court. And I think the heart of the matter was set out very well by Lord Drummond Young in Scotland when he said it\u2019s not the job of the courts to subject government to political scrutiny, that\u2019s the job of parliament, but where government prevents parliament from doing that job of scrutiny, the courts can step in to make sure that parliamentary democracy is restored. I think that\u2019s the heart of the Scottish judgment and I think that sets out the constitutional position as it should be and as I believe it is across the UK and that\u2019s why I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that the UK judges will follow the Scottish courts. Gina Miller, the businesswoman and campaigner who brought one of the cases being decided by the supreme court, has issued this statement ahead of today\u2019s hearing. As with my first case, my supreme court case is about pushing back against what is clearly a dramatic overreach of executive power. This is an issue that cuts across the political divides \u2013 and the arguments about the EU \u2013 and it has united remainers and leavers and people of all political complexions and none in opposition to it. The precedent [Boris] Johnson will set \u2013 if this is allowed to stand \u2013 is terrifying: any prime minister trying to push through a policy that is unpopular in the House and in the country at large would from now on simply be able to resort to prorogation. No one could ever have envisaged it being used in this way: this is a classic power grab. The reason given for the prorogation was patently untrue and, since then, the refusal to come clean or provide any of the disclosures we have asked for has compounded the deception. It is my view \u2013 and the view of a great many others \u2013 that Mr Johnson has gone too far and put our parliamentary sovereignty and democracy in grave danger by his actions. Here are some pictures from outside the supreme court. Given the wider context, Downing Street might have thought twice before deciding today was the day to send Robert Buckland, the attorney general, out into the studios to promote a plan for longer jail sentences for people who break the law. But that is what he was doing on the Today programme when he refused to rule out Boris Johnson suspending parliament for a second time before the Brexit deadline on 31 October. Asked if it was even \u201cremotely conceivable\u201d that Johnson might suspend (prorogue, to use the technical term) parliament again (MPs are due to return on 14 October), Buckland did not say no. Instead he replied: Well, you know, it feels in politics, Harold Wilson said a week is a long time in politics, it seems like an hour is a long time in politics at the moment. For me to sit here and imagine what might happen at the end of October, I think, is idle. What I do know is, if we are able to, we will have a Queen\u2019s speech in mid-October, there will be debate during that time, and a vote as well, perhaps a series of votes. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg yesterday, Johnson himself also refused to rule out suspending parliament again when asked directly to do so. Joe Moor, who was the director of legislative affairs at Downing Street when Theresa May was prime minister, explained in an article in the Sunday Telegraph two days ago (paywall), that if the government wins the supreme court case starting today, it would be possible for Johnson to suspend parliament again after it returns on 14 October, at least until 6 November. It would have to be sitting on those two days because of an amendment passed to the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act, Moor explained. All of which is why today\u2019s supreme court hearing is so important. Here is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s overnight preview story. And here is his analysis of the issues at stake. There is a live feed of the hearing, so I will be covering it in detail. Undoubtedly it is likely to be heavy going \u2013 the supreme court is not the Old Bailey, and if you are not interested in arcane points of constitutional law, it might be a day to tune into the Lib Dem conference instead \u2013 but this is a case that could reset the boundaries between parliament and the executive, and curtail or expand Johnson\u2019s Brexit options, so it is clearly of the utmost importance. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 10.30am: The supreme court begins the three-day hearing to decide whether Johnson\u2019s lengthy suspension (prorogation, to use the technical term) of parliament was unlawful. 2.10pm: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, winds up her party conference with her keynote speech. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will mostly be focusing on the supreme court hearing. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "At the start of the three-day hearing to resolve contradictory judgments made by Scottish and English courts on the prorogation of parliament, attempts to refine the interlocking issues seemed on occasions to baffle even the finest legal minds. One of the first fundamental questions for the supreme court is whether Boris Johnson\u2019s private advice to the Queen to prorogue parliament was \u201cjusticiable\u201d \u2013 that is, whether such a decision ought to be regulated by judges. Lord Keen and the government have argued that because such a decision is purely \u201cpolitical\u201d there are no absolute legal standards by which any court can judge whether the prime minister\u2019s actions were a proper use of his powers or not. Could a prorogation of 10 days, 20 days or several months be deemed to be reasonable, the government lawyers asked? Countering that claim, Lord Pannick QC pointed out that numerous judicial review cases, such as the former article 50 Brexit case, have involved highly politicised questions yet were unquestionably matters that the court decided it could consider. That first question of justiciability is what the 11 justices on the UK\u2019s highest court will have to resolve before they move on to the question of whether the prime minister\u2019s advice was a proper or improper use of the government\u2019s executive powers. The three Scottish judges, when considering whether the extended prorogation was lawful, reached the conclusion that it had been enforced by Johnson purely as a device to stymie MPs\u2019 scrutiny of Brexit policy at a moment of national crisis. Pannick adopted their arguments, maintaining that parliament is sovereign. For the government to use its power to evade that scrutiny overturns the basic principles of constitutional law, he said. Johnson was motivated by an \u201cimproper purpose\u201d, namely to avoid parliamentary control over his policies, Pannick added. The court, Pannick said, could draw adverse inferences about the PM\u2019s motives from the fact he had not given a statement to the courts. Johnson, he said, would not have recommended a five week-long prorogation unless he had wanted to avoid being challenged. But Keen said there was no statement from Johnson because the cabinet documents released clearly set out the reasons for the long delay, namely that it was to allow for the conference season and preparation for a new Queen\u2019s speech. There was nothing improper about the PM\u2019s motives. During the afternoon, Keen \u2013 no doubt anticipating arguments to be made later this week by Scottish lawyers for the Scottish National party MP Joanna Cherry QC \u2013 insisted there was no difference between the law north and south of the border. He said there was no legal difference between the 1688 English bill of rights and the 1689 Scottish claim of rights. \u201cThe prorogation of parliament does not have a direct impact on any individual legal rights,\u201d he maintained.",

      "bodyText": "A judge will today reveal her reasons for slapping a $140m asset freezing order on controversial businessman and political donor Huang Xiangmo after an application by the Australian taxation office. At an urgent hearing in Sydney on Monday, federal court judge Anna Katzmann ordered Huang not to dispose of assets worth up to the $140.9m claimed by the ATO, including more than $6m worth of property in Sydney and an apartment in Hong Kong. The judge said Huang Xiangmo could only use the money to pay his debt to the ATO, or for \u201cordinary living expenses\u201d of up to $10,000 a week. He is also allowed to pay legal expenses of up to $50,000. She also ordered Huang\u2019s wife, Huang Jiefang, not to sell a $12.8m mansion in Mosman. The amount claimed by the ATO reportedly represents a tax bill it hit the couple with last week. Neither was represented in court on Monday. Huang Xiangmo could not be reached and Huang Jiefang did not respond to an email sent to an address provided in Katzmann\u2019s orders. The orders also reveal that Huang Xiangmo has previously engaged two big four tax partners to work for him, Deloitte\u2019s Spyros Kotsopoulos and KPMG\u2019s Brent Murphy. There is no suggestion either has done anything wrong. Katzmann told the ATO to attempt to serve her orders and other court paperwork on Huang by leaving copies at the Sydney offices of Deloitte, KPMG and two law firms, HWL Ebsworth and Unsworth Legal. On Tuesday, the ATO\u2019s lawyers moved to secure their foothold on the Huangs\u2019 Sydney property portfolio by filing documents with the NSW titles office relating to the Mosman mansion and two pieces of land in Chatswood, a house and a flat, held by Huang Xiangmo, that are together worth about $6.4m. The documents were not available from the land titles office yesterday afternoon. Katzmann will hand down her judgment at 4.30pm today ahead of a case management hearing on Friday morning. Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese billionaire property developer who arrived in Australia in 2011, assiduously cultivated influence with both sides of Australian politics, donating $2.7m to both Liberal and Labor parties and appearing in photographs with prime ministers and ministers. Labor senator Sam Dastyari was forced to resign from parliament after revelations he had asked Huang for money to pay personal legal bills and warned Huang he was under surveillance. Huang\u2019s permanent residency visa was summarily cancelled \u2013 and his application for Australian citizenship refused \u2013 by the Morrison government last December on character grounds, and after Asio warned political parties against accepting any more money from Huang. Of particular concern was his long-running involvement with the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, which has been accused of being a front for Chinese government efforts to expand its global influence. Despite his exile from Australia, Huang has re-emerged as a key figure in the Independent Commission Against Corruption\u2019s current investigation into Labor party donations this month. Icac has heard allegations that Huang gave the NSW branch of the ALP $100,000 \u2013 personally delivered in cash in an Aldi shopping bag \u2013 in breach of electoral regulations which prohibits property developers donating. From Hong Kong, Huang has denied being the source of the money but has refused to give evidence to Icac.",

No one seemed in the mood to quibble about that.</p> <p>Second, there was the matter of public law. It was wrong for the government to prorogue parliament just because the prime minister was scared of what it might do.

And if the supreme court wasn\u2019t prepared to act over a five-week prorogation then would it stand by and let him suspend parliament for longer at a later date? That observation definitely seemed to land with most of the judges.</p> <p>It was a poor day for nominative determinism.

      "bodyText": "Swimming four lengths does not sound like a particularly impressive achievement. But when those lengths add up to nearly 134 miles (215km) in the open sea, and when they have been completed by a breast cancer survivor a year after treatment, they look more like an extraordinary world first. Over 54 gruelling hours from midnight on Sunday until dawn on Tuesday, the American ultra long-distance swimmer Sarah Thomas, 37, became the first person to swim the Channel four times without stopping. Thomas dedicated her achievement to fellow breast cancer survivors. Thomas\u2019s feat was accomplished in the face of strong tides that extended a route that had originally been expected to cover 84 miles, far less than the distance she eventually completed. The British endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh described the achievement as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201csuperhuman\u201d. She was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer in November 2017 and underwent chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. Thomas\u2019s support team said she used swimming as a means of coping. In a Facebook post, a member of her team said the conditions on the final leg were \u201cdark, windy and choppy\u201d. They added: \u201cThis is supposed to be the most challenging leg of the swim so please keep up the good vibes you\u2019ve all been sending her way.\u201d Thomas celebrated her success with champagne and chocolates. An official observer said she had tested the limits of endurance. \u201cIt is amazing, absolutely inspirational. At the end we were very emotional,\u201d Kevin Murphy said. Thomas told the BBC: \u201cI just can\u2019t believe we did it. I\u2019m pretty tired right now.\u201d She said she planned to sleep for the rest of the day. Before the swim, Thomas admitted she was scared of the challenge. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this swim for over two years now and have fought so hard to get here. Am I 100%?

      "body": "<p>The Liberal Democrats\u2019 new referendum bypass policy to stop Brexit is clearly a tactical error, as identified by Polly Toynbee (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/16/jo-swinson-liberal-democrats-remain-extremism-labour-opportunity-brexit\" title=\"\">Swinson\u2019s move to revoke hands Labour a golden opportunity</a>, 17 September). It also has the greater significance of sinking their claim to the moral high ground on EU policy, already flawed by their failure to acknowledge their role in generating the current mess (and indeed their responsibility for austerity).</p> <p>It was, after all, not David Cameron but acting Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, who, as early as 2007, proposed amending the Queen\u2019s speech to incorporate an in/out EU referendum, stating that \u201cwe trust the people to make a decision about whether we should stay in or get out\u201d, a position subsequently reinforced by Nick Clegg. After the 2016 referendum, Cable thought a second one would be \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. By the 2017 general election, Lib Dem policy had evolved to giving the people the final say on a negotiated deal, remarkably similar to Labour\u2019s position today.</p> <p>Toynbee calls for Labour to back an immediate referendum, but this makes it difficult to avoid including an irresponsible no-deal option, which could be ruled out by achieving an anti-Tory majority in a general election.Jo Swinson should drop her opposition to cooperating with Labour and work towards a post-election referendum in which, rather than dismissing 17.4 million leave voters, she will have ample opportunity to persuade an overall majority to vote to remain in the EU.<br><strong>Dr Anthony Isaacs</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 After the Lib Dems\u2019 pledge to revoke Brexit without a referendum I find myself politically homeless. A passionate remainer, I would struggle to vote for a party that has betrayed its own liberal principles. The first-past-the-post electoral system (which the Lib Dems have pledged to replace) means that majority governments very rarely represent a majority of the electorate. For this reason \u2013 and for many other reasons \u2013 no general election can or should serve as a referendum on membership of the EU. An \u201cunlikely\u201d Lib Dem majority in the House of Commons would not give a mandate to overturn the 2016 referendum. We have to find a different way out of the Brexit nightmare.<br><strong>Sarah Lornie</strong><br><em>Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Fair enough for Polly Toynbee to criticise what she considers a Lib Dem blunder and an opportunity for Labour. But to label continuing to do what we\u2019ve been doing since 1973 as \u201cextreme\u201d seems rather harsh. And to describe it as \u201cto hell with the will of the people\u201d when <a href=\"https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/should-the-united-kingdom-remain-a-member-of-the-european-union-or-leave-the-european-union-asked-after-the-referendum/\" title=\"\">28 out of the last 30 polls</a> show a clear majority for staying in the EU over leaving seems rather like falling for Tory rhetoric.<br><strong>Mark Walford</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 You write that the Liberal Democrats\u2019 promise to revoke article 50 lacks a democratic mandate (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/16/the-guardian-view-on-a-liberal-democrat-revoke-a-promise-that-wont-be-redeemed\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 17 September). But a mandate is precisely what they would have, were they to win a parliamentary majority. The comparison with the SNP and a Scottish independence referendum is specious; severing the union will require an act of the Westminster parliament, which the SNP cannot hope to control. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 policy offers a welcome return to representative democracy, and an end to the mania for referenda. Let the people decide, yes, but in a general election.<br><strong>Christopher Fryer</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 \u201cThe Lib Dems \u2026 home to Keynes and Beveridge?\u201d No, I don\u2019t think so. The Liberal Democrats party came into existence in 1989.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats\u2019 new referendum bypass policy to stop Brexit is clearly a tactical error, as identified by Polly Toynbee (Swinson\u2019s move to revoke hands Labour a golden opportunity, 17 September). It also has the greater significance of sinking their claim to the moral high ground on EU policy, already flawed by their failure to acknowledge their role in generating the current mess (and indeed their responsibility for austerity). It was, after all, not David Cameron but acting Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, who, as early as 2007, proposed amending the Queen\u2019s speech to incorporate an in/out EU referendum, stating that \u201cwe trust the people to make a decision about whether we should stay in or get out\u201d, a position subsequently reinforced by Nick Clegg. After the 2016 referendum, Cable thought a second one would be \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. By the 2017 general election, Lib Dem policy had evolved to giving the people the final say on a negotiated deal, remarkably similar to Labour\u2019s position today. Toynbee calls for Labour to back an immediate referendum, but this makes it difficult to avoid including an irresponsible no-deal option, which could be ruled out by achieving an anti-Tory majority in a general election.Jo Swinson should drop her opposition to cooperating with Labour and work towards a post-election referendum in which, rather than dismissing 17.4 million leave voters, she will have ample opportunity to persuade an overall majority to vote to remain in the EU. Dr Anthony Isaacs London \u2022 After the Lib Dems\u2019 pledge to revoke Brexit without a referendum I find myself politically homeless. A passionate remainer, I would struggle to vote for a party that has betrayed its own liberal principles. The first-past-the-post electoral system (which the Lib Dems have pledged to replace) means that majority governments very rarely represent a majority of the electorate. For this reason \u2013 and for many other reasons \u2013 no general election can or should serve as a referendum on membership of the EU. An \u201cunlikely\u201d Lib Dem majority in the House of Commons would not give a mandate to overturn the 2016 referendum. We have to find a different way out of the Brexit nightmare. Sarah Lornie Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex \u2022 Fair enough for Polly Toynbee to criticise what she considers a Lib Dem blunder and an opportunity for Labour. But to label continuing to do what we\u2019ve been doing since 1973 as \u201cextreme\u201d seems rather harsh. And to describe it as \u201cto hell with the will of the people\u201d when 28 out of the last 30 polls show a clear majority for staying in the EU over leaving seems rather like falling for Tory rhetoric. Mark Walford London \u2022 You write that the Liberal Democrats\u2019 promise to revoke article 50 lacks a democratic mandate (Editorial, 17 September). But a mandate is precisely what they would have, were they to win a parliamentary majority. The comparison with the SNP and a Scottish independence referendum is specious; severing the union will require an act of the Westminster parliament, which the SNP cannot hope to control. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 policy offers a welcome return to representative democracy, and an end to the mania for referenda. Let the people decide, yes, but in a general election. Christopher Fryer London \u2022 \u201cThe Lib Dems \u2026 home to Keynes and Beveridge?\u201d No, I don\u2019t think so. The Liberal Democrats party came into existence in 1989. Its only taste of power since then would have Keynes and Beveridge turning in their graves. Colin Challen Scarborough \u2022 The Lib Dems are often stereotyped as wishy-washy fence-sitters, but we have been consistent as the pro-remain party from the beginning. Everyone knows that. If we came to power on that manifesto it would be a clear mandate to put an end to Brexit by revoking article 50. Stephanie Bailey Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset \u2022 Seeing my suggestions for Labour (Letters, 10 September) \u2013 general election, no referendum, back remain \u2013 cynically taken over by the Liberal Democrats, I think I prefer Labour\u2019s honest \u201cmuddle\u201d after all!

One MP even suggested the optimism was even more palpable than the days of Cleggmania. However there was one point of consensus: amid so many political imponderables, a lot could change in the following few months. Nonetheless, most of the Lib Dem faithful will return home from a sunny few days in Bournemouth energised for an election which could very conceivably end with Jo Swinson cast as the powerbroker in a hung parliament. Quite what Swinson would do with that power was the great unanswered question, as she has categorically ruled out supporting either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn in office, informally or otherwise. Beyond Brexit there is still a feeling among the party faithful that policy is a little thin.

Other election policies beyond the EU included an idea for a so-called wellbeing metric for future budgets, basing decisions on not just likely economic growth but also assessments of how they could affect people\u2019s happiness and sense of purpose.

      "bodyText": "The leader of Ukip has been accused of a \u201ccomplete insult\u201d after he decided to boycott his own party conference due to low ticket sales. Richard Braine has pulled out of the conference after fewer than 450 tickets were sold for the two-day event. The party was hoping to attract double the amount of delegates to the event in Newport, south Wales, later this month. In the latest furore to engulf the party infamous for its public spats, the Ukip chair, Kirstan Herriot, wrote to all members stating new leader Braine had attempted to cancel the conference due to a potentially low turnout. In the email sent to all members, Herriot, backed by Ukip\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC), said Braine\u2019s stance had been a complete affront to \u201chard-working\u201d party members. She confirmed the conference would go ahead despite Braine\u2019s no-show. She wrote: \u201cBoth I and the NEC believe it is a complete insult to the membership to attempt to cancel conference because of a potentially low turn out. It is also a particular affront to hard-working regional, county and branch officers who have worked hard in encouraging members to attend conference to hear Richard lay out his vision for the future of Ukip. It is therefore a particular shame that he has decided not to do this.\u201d In order to increase delegate numbers, the party said it had now decided to offer some free single-day tickets and those who had paid for their one-day ticket would be offered a refund. Herriot\u2019s email added that Braine was still welcome to take his \u201crightful place\u201d on the conference stage should he have a \u201cchange of heart\u201d. Ukip has suffered a slump in the polls following the rise of the Brexit party, which was founded by Nigel Farage after he quit Ukip over the former leader Gerard Batten\u2019s anti-Islam views and links to the far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Ukip\u2019s ruling NEC blocked Batten from standing again for the leadership, but his ally Braine was elected by the membership instead. In a vote of members with a turnout of about 25%, Braine received 53% of the vote. When contacted by the Guardian, Braine said he would not be commenting, saying only that it was an internal decision by the chair to contact party members. However, in an email to Ukip members, Braine confirmed his decision, saying he had been informed by the party treasurer that it was facing a \u201cvery low turnout\u201d for its conference. Braine said he had proposed moving the conference to a venue in north-east England and called for Batten to be reinstated to the party. He claimed the NEC had been misinformed about the number of attendees, with the real number being much lower. He wrote: \u201cI have made clear to the chairman and NEC that I would not attend unless something drastic was done to increase ticket sales, namely returning Gerard Batten to good standing to heal the rift with the many members who are boycotting conference for that reason, and installing one of the two candidates I have put forward to be chairman.\u201d Braine claims his advice was rejected.",

The airline said its ambitious proposals would mean more choice and lower fares for passengers. However, Virgin acknowledged growth would depend on how the government chooses to allocate the hundreds of new daily slots available at the London airport after the third runway is built, possibly by 2026. Virgin currently flies to 19 long-haul destinations from Heathrow, but wants to serve 103 airports including European and domestic routes, and become a \u201csecond flag-carrier\u201d. The airline said the government could put \u201can end to IAG\u2019s [International Airlines Group] stranglehold over the UK\u2019s only hub airport\u201d by allowing a serious competitor to emerge. IAG, the parent company of BA, as well as Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, controls more than half of Heathrow\u2019s slots. Research commissioned by Virgin found one in four Heathrow passengers can only fly with IAG, and could be paying 10% more in air fares as a result. The rules governing slot allocation at Heathrow are being reviewed by the government as part of its aviation strategy. Virgin said ministers should grasp a \u201conce-in-a-generation opportunity to shake up the Heathrow market\u201d. The airline proposes to compete on 26 of the 77 routes currently operated only by IAG from the airport, ranging from Bogot\u00e1 and Buenos Aires to Budapest and Barcelona. Virgin would also add direct routes to new destinations including Kolkata, Jakarta and Panama City. Domestic routes would include Glasgow and Newcastle, likely served by the Flybe fleet acquired as part of the Connect Airways consortium, expected to soon be rebranded under a Virgin label.

Broken Moon is a poem that describes, in tender terms, her relationship to her baby daughter, Emma, who was born with a serious disability which she overcame remarkably. Pulling Away (from Changing the Subject) is also about her, later on. It begins:</p> <p><em>Your first journey alone.</em><br><em>I\u2019ve seen you to your seat,</em><br><em>stowed your bag, fussed</em><br><em>over coat and book and sandwiches.</em><br><em>You asked me not to ask another passenger</em><br><em>To help you out at York;</em><br><em>You\u2019ll manage (but the bag\u2019s too heavy)</em><br><em>Someone will help, you say.</em><br></p> <p><em>Of course they will.</em><br><em>Your at-homeness in the world</em><br><em>Is something I took thirty years to learn. </em><br></p> <p>Carole\u2019s poems find interest, enjoyment and pathos in many experiences, which are illuminated in the act \u2013 or, as she said, the work \u2013 of describing them.

In an update that cut its share price in half, Sirius Minerals said it did not believe it could raise the money in current market conditions, dealing a major blow to its hopes of extracting a potent fertiliser called polyhalite from 2021. The Woodsmith Mine project, which involves building a 23-mile-long underground conveyor belt to take the mineral to Teesside for export, could deliver \u00a3100bn of economic benefits to the UK over 50 years, according to Sirius. About 1,200 current employees are at risk if the project is cancelled, while Sirius estimates that once up and running, the mine would support around 2,500 high-earning jobs in an area suffering from economic deprivation, as well as benefiting hundreds of local people who bought shares in the company at an early stage. Chief executive Chris Fraser said a refusal by the government to guarantee $1bn of debt was among factors that deterred potential investors from lending $500m, even at a high interest rate of 13%. \u201cWe made a request, [the government] said no and we\u2019ll be working up a number of financing alternatives,\u201d he said, citing the risk involved in drilling two 1,500m mine shafts as being among the factors that deterred the government. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to have an open dialogue with government and there may be a structure that they find acceptable that does balance the risk and reward to the taxpayer,\u201d Fraser said. Anna Turley, the Labour MP for Redcar, criticised the decision not to provide financial backing for a project she said would bring jobs to the region. A government spokesman said he could not comment on commercially sensitive matters but that \u201call requests for financial support must meet necessary lending criteria\u201d. \u201cWhen examining any request for financing, we have to assess the potential of a project against the need to protect taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said. Fraser said lack of state support had exacerbated \u201csoured\u201d conditions in the bond markets caused by factors including uncertainty about investment in the UK amid the ongoing turmoil of Brexit. \u201cThe main factors related to the current status of the bond market, uncertainties around Brexit and the political situation in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are two very strong negative winds to go against when you\u2019re trying to raise multi billions of dollars for a project like this.\u201d Success in securing the extra money from new bond investors would have unlocked a conditional $2.5bn finance package agreed with Wall Street bank JP Morgan. Without it, the company now has approximately six months before it runs out of cash to fund its operations. Fraser said the company was now looking for alternative investors and could turn to a sovereign wealth fund, large fertiliser companies or a major mining group. However, he said he does not expect to receive any further funds from Australia\u2019s richest woman Gina Rinehart, the mining magnate who has invested $250m in the Woodsmith Mine project via her Hancock Prospecting company. Graham Spooner, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: \u201cWith cash running out fast, investors will be fearing for the future of the mine and remain cognisant that the recent history of mining in the UK has been littered with failures.\u201d Investors include tens of thousands of small shareholders, including local people in North Yorkshire who have been captivated by the ambitious plans and the prospect of huge returns on their investment. Sirius has agreements in place with potential customers to buy up to 13.3m tonnes of Poly4 a year over five to 10 years and claims the global market for it is more than 30 times that size.",

      "bodyText": "Finally, Britain\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index has ended the day where it started, down just 1 point at 7,320. Relief at the falling oil price lifted some stocks, but this was countered by a rising pound (which pulls down multinationals\u2019 overseas earnings). Investors were also cautious ahead of Wednesday\u2019s US interest rate decision. How high could the oil price go, if full-blown conflict breaks out? Simona Gambarini of Capital Economics think they could more than double from today\u2019s levels. In a worst-case scenario. She told clients: We continue to think that US-China trade tensions and the outlook for Fed policy remain more important drivers of oil prices. Nonetheless, we would not rule out entirely the possibility of an escalation in tensions, leading to an outright conflict in the Middle East. In that case, we would not be surprised to see oil prices reach, and perhaps even rise above, $150 per barrel by end-2019. Intriguingly, the top Saudi source who spoke to Reuters also said Saudi Aramco had recovered \u201cvery fast\u201d from the crisis, which highlights the \u201creal value\u201d of the company. That could, perhaps, show that Riyadh is keen to shore up confidence in Aramco, and not allow its upcoming stock market flotation to be ruined by the attacks. Despite this sudden reversal, oil is still up around 7% compared with Friday night, before a swarm of drones attacked the Abqaiq oil facility. That suggests oil is now seen as a riskier asset, with a greater risk of military conflict in the Gulf region. And no wonder, with US senator Lindsey Graham yesterday suggesting an attack on Iran\u2019s oil refineries to \u201cbreak the regime\u2019s back\u201d: Here\u2019s the Reuters news story that send oil prices tumbling a few minutes ago: Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil output will be fully back online quicker than initially thought following weekend attacks on production facilities, two sources briefed on the latest developments told Reuters on Tuesday. The Kingdom is close to restoring 70% of the 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) production lost following the attacks, one of the sources, a top Saudi source briefed on the latest developments, said. That source said output will be fully back online in the next 2-3 weeks. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the price of a barrel of Brent crude has suddenly tumbled, having posted its biggest ever percentage gain on Monday. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the news that the disruption to Saudi oil production could be less than feared. NEWSFLASH: The oil price is suddenly plunging. Brent crude has slumped by more than four dollars per barrel, dropping back to just $64.77 -- having hit $69/barrel earlier this morning. That\u2019s a huge move -- down around 6% today (almost half of Monday\u2019s incredible surge). US crude is also plunging, down almost $3 per barrel to $60.16. The sudden selloff been triggered by a Reuters report that Saudi Arabia will repair the damage from Saturday\u2019s attack on its major production facilities sooner than expected. Source have told Reuters that Output will return to normal levels sooner than thought Output will be \u201cfully back online\u201d in the next two to three weeks Saudi is close to restoring 70% of the 5.7m barrels per day lost Impact on oil exports has been minimal, thanks to Saudi\u2019s Aramco\u2019s oil storage More to follow! The New York stock exchange has dipped into the red at the start of trading, adding to yesterday\u2019s declines. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 89 points or 0.33%, as worries about the Middle East mount. Here\u2019s a video clip of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, speaking today: It\u2019s important to remember just how big Saudi Aramco is. As this chart from the Economist shows, Aramco produces nearly as much oil as Shell, Exxon, Total and Chevron put together. And given the relatively low cost of extracting crude in Saudi Arabia, it makes more profits than that quartet -- plus BP as well. So by hitting than half of Aramco\u2019s production capacity, last weekend\u2019s attacks have had a serious impact. Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman has insisted that Riyadh can deal with the consequences of the attacks on its oil production installations. King Salman chaired a meeting of Saudi ministers today, where the cabinet reviewed the damage. In a statement, the cabinet said the Saudi Kingdom vowed to \u201cdefend its land and vital installations\u201d, and that Saturday\u2019s attack was intended to disrupt global oil supplies. The cabinet also called on world governments to confront the attacks on Aramco\u2019s production facilities \u201cregardless of their origin\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). Earlier today Iran\u2019s supreme leader ruled out negotiations with the US \u201cat any level\u201d, claiming that Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East strategy was \u201cworthless\u201d. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was speaking a day after Washington blamed Tehran for attacks on Saudi oil installations. The AFP newswire has more details: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the US adopted a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran because it believes it cannot bring the Islamic republic to its knees through other means. The leader was speaking after devastating drone attacks at the weekend that halved oil output of Iran\u2019s regional arch-rival Saudi Arabia - the world\u2019s top crude exporter. \u201cThe policy of \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 against the Iranian nation is worthless and all Islamic Republic of Iran officials unanimously believe there will be no negotiations with the US at any level,\u201d he said in a televised address. Tensions between Iran and the US and its allies have threatened to boil over since May last year when President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear deal and began reimposing sanctions in its campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d. The rising tensions in the Middle East, with Iran seizing several oil tankers and Houthi rebels attacking Saudi targets, had already hurt the markets. Shares have been dropping in Riyadh in recent weeks, and have now lost all this year\u2019s gains: Back in the UK, plans for a huge mine on the North Yorkshire Moors have been plunged into doubt, putting over 1,000 jobs at risk. It\u2019s also a blow to thousands of small investors, many living in the area, who had backed Sirius Minerals\u2019 plan to mine fertiliser. Sirius cancelled a $500m bond sale, to fund the project, this morning. It said it was struggling to sell the bond, and will now hold a \u201ccomprehensive strategic review\u201d over its future. It also said the UK government had declined to provide financial support. The news sent Sirius\u2019s shares plunging over 50%. Many Middle Eastern stock market have lost ground today -- not terribly surprising, with Donald Trump\u2019s threat of military retaliation hanging over the region. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Tadawul index is down 1%, led by natural resources companies and energy producers. Bank shares also dropped. Across the region, Egypt\u2019s EGX 30 shed 0.8%, while the UAE\u2019s DFM index has lost 1%. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, sums up the morning: This morning equity markets are mixed as traders remain cautious about the political situation in the Middle East. Tensions in the region have been heightened in the wake of the attack in Saudi Arabia over the weekend. Oil is a touch lower after the mammoth move yesterday, but it is massively up on the week, and that highlights the fear about disruption to production. The macroeconomic outlook is a little soft, as the Chinese economy is slowing down, the German manufacturing sector is in contraction, plus the uncertainty in relation to Brexit, so higher oil prices are likely to make matters worse for the global economy. Could Saudi Aramco follow WeWork\u2019s lead, and delay its IPO? Saturday\u2019s attacks have thrown Aramco\u2019s stock market float plans into fresh uncertainty. Investors must be more concerned that its oil facilities are vulnerable to attack, and concerned that geopolitical risks are rising. Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, says investors will probably demand a higher \u201crisk premium\u201d when Aramco eventually comes to market. \u201cOil futures curves for 3-10 years out have moved up about $1.25 from around the $50 mark. So while the spot market has jumped, reflecting near-term impacts on immediate oil availability and supply chain issues, the longer-term price has taken this in its stride, up 2-3%, with a modest bump up in prices, leading to an uptick in oil stocks or around 3-4%. It would seem logical that Aramco\u2019s IPO will be delayed while the damage is assessed but beyond this we would expect that the risk premium that investors will require should the IPO go ahead will now be higher.\u201d Saudi Aramco has reportedly warned some clients that there will be delays to their oil deliveries, following last weekend\u2019s attack. According to Bloomberg, at least four clients have been warned to expect delays of either days, or weeks. But, they\u2019ve also been reassured that they\u2019ll get their order eventually Reuters has more details: Saudi Aramco informed PetroChina on Tuesday that its loadings of light crude oil for October will be delayed by about 10 days, said a senior Chinese state oil source with knowledge of the matter. However, Aramco, the state oil company of Saudi Arabia, will still supply the same grades and volumes of light crude oil requested for October nominations, the source said. The Chinese state refiner was also told that its September-loading light crude cargoes will be swapped to heavier grades with no change in volumes or delays, the source said. \u201cThe (loading dates and volumes of) September cargoes are too prompt to be changed, as Aramco may be still assessing the damages to its facilities,\u201d said the source. Just in: German investors are even gloomier about their current economic situation, but slightly more optimistic about the future. That\u2019s according to the Munich-based ZEW Institute. Its monthly survey showed that investors are still concerned about Brexit, and the US-China trade war. But, they\u2019re also hopeful that the European Central Bank\u2019s new stimulus package, announced last week, will boost growth. ZEW reports that: Current conditions index: fell to -19.9, down from 13.5 in August. Worse than expected. Economic sentiment index: up to -22.5, from -44.1 in August. Better than expected. US energy secretary Rick Perry is trying to calm the markets again. Perry, who\u2019s attending an energy conference in Vienna, told reporters that the US is confident that markets are \u201cwell-supplied\u201d. He said: \u201cWith regard to energy markets, the president has directed me to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if that is needed to offset any potential disruptions. But looking at the supply numbers we are confident that the markets remain well-supplied.\u201d Traders may not entirely share Perry\u2019s confidence. As this tweet shows, the Brent crude oil price surged by a record amount yesterday, after the Saudi attack knocked out 5% of global output. The markets are concerned that: a) supplies won\u2019t be restored quickly, b) the shortfall won\u2019t be fully covered by other countries c) Military retaliation against Iran (who deny involvement) could disrupt supplies further China\u2019s government has condemned the attack on the Saudi Aramco oil facilities, but also called for calm. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing: \u201cChina condemns this attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities and opposes any attacks on civilians or civilian facilities,\u201d She added that relevant parties must \u201cto avoid taking actions that bring about an escalation in regional tensions\u201d. Asia-Pacific stock markets have closed for the day, with losses in China (-1.68%) and Hong Kong (-1.1%), but small gains in Australia (+0.3%). The Brent crude oil price is rising again, back over $69 and heading towards fresh four-month highs. As you can see here, it spiked dramatically yesterday after the Saudi oil attack, surging by 14% -- a move usually only seen in times of war and economic crisis. Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to release oil from America\u2019s reserves helped to stabilise the oil price.... but investors remain concerned that Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities may not be fixed for weeks... Neil Mellor of BNY Mellon says: Brent crude prices spiked on Sunday\u2019s news, with the front-end contract rising $12 from around the $60 mark in New York on Friday. That prices steadied thereafter was undoubtedly in part due to President Trump\u2019s immediate assurances that oil would be released from the strategic reserve. But prices have since risen to fresh highs amid the realization that supply-related risks are seemingly on the rise. Most immediately, it is unclear when the oil facilities \u2013 which produce more than 5% of global supply \u2013 will be up and running once more. Certainly, Aramco stated on Sunday that it was looking to have restored around one-third of lost output by yesterday evening. However, a source close to the matter told Reuters that the return to full oil capacity could take \u201cweeks, not days\u201d. Shares in cruise operator Carnival have dropped by 3% in early trading, to the bottom of the FTSE 100 losers column. Higher oil prices will eat into its profits, and could also hurt economic growth - possibly meaning fewer people can pay for that trip of a lifetime.... Shares in oil giant have risen again this morning, as investors anticipate higher crude prices. BP and Royal Dutch Shell topped the FTSE 100 risers at the open, up around 1%. WeWork\u2019s business model is pretty simple -- it buys offices, and then rents it out to businesses, or individual workers who might want an occasional hot-desk. The idea is that WeWork handles everything -- from paying the utility bills to restocking the printer -- along with some enticing downtime options including video games and table football. For a while there was even unlimited free beer. But ultimately, it\u2019s office rental -- so a $47bn valuation always looked toppy. Last week, my colleague Nils Pratley outlined the four reasons investors weren\u2019t keen on backing the IPO. The pricing looked too rich, with losses of $1.9bn last year and more to come. Rivals are valued more modestly -- eg: London-listed property group IWG, is only worth \u00a33.6bn despite actually making a profit WeWork\u2019s business model - taking on long leases on big buildings and offering tenants short, flexible rents - is vulnerable to the economic cycle. Customers could trade down to a cheaper office -- or even flexiwork from a cafe - but WeWorkd can\u2019t cut its costs. Fourth, and perhaps most seriously, there\u2019s WeWork\u2019s \u201cbreezy style of corporate governance\u201d. As Nils put it: Co-founder Adam Neumann wasn\u2019t obviously living up to the spirit of collective endeavour when his investment vehicle was paid $5.9m by the company for the right to use the trademarked word \u201cwe\u201d. The sum has been repaid but how was the arrangement ever approved? The We Company, the parent of WeWork, insists that its float will still take place by the end of the year (just not next week). In a statement following the postponement of its IPO, it says: \u201cThe We Company is looking forward to our upcoming [initial public offering], which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. We want to thank all of our employees, members and partners for their ongoing commitment.\u201d But... the delay is going to cause problems. WeWork needs to raise at least $3bn through a float to unlock a new $6bn debt facility from its banks. As WeWork is currently loss-making, it would have to raise cash elsewhere if it lost that credit line. No wonder it hopes to press on. Ironically the delay could be good news for Japanese tech investor SoftBank, a major investor in We. Last year it injected $3bn, in a move valuing We at around $45bn. Had We only floated at, $20bn, SoftBank\u2019s investment wouldn\u2019t look very rosy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are extremely edgy today as investors worry about rising tensions in the Middle East. Last weekend\u2019s attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s massive oil facility at Abqaiq, and America\u2019s threat of military response, has knocked shares around the world and driven oil prices alarmingly higher. Fears of supply shortages drove crude prices alarmingly higher on Monday, up over 14%. Brent crude spiked to $69 per barrel, the biggest one-day jump since the 1980s. US crude finished at $62, the biggest one-day move since the financial crisis. The jump in oil prices has hit airline stocks. Higher crude prices could mean slower global growth -- hurting banks, industrial firms and consumer goods makers. Last night, the US Dow Jones lost 142 points, or 0.5%. Stocks have fallen in Asia overnight, with China\u2019s CSI 300 index losing 1.7% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropping by 1,5%. Donald Trump has insisted that he doesn\u2019t want war in the Middle East, but Washington are also insisting the attacks has Tehran\u2019s fingerprints on it. Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader, says investors worry that an oil price shock could push the global economy down: Global equity markets are stabilising after the drone attack but remain in a state of limbo trying to access the economic damage of a possible lengthy oil price shocker, keeping in mind that every recession since 1973 has included an oil price shock, versus the favourable medium-term S&amp;P 500 correlation to higher oil prices. All the while, nervously evaluating the possibility of a joint military response from the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. The other big news of the morning is that WeWork, the office space sharing firm, has postponed its controversial stock market flotation. WeWork was forced to pull its IPO after getting a lukewarm, bordering on chilly, reception from potential investors. The office sharing firm was once valued by major investor SoftBank at $47bn (\u00a337.8bn), but was forced to slash its ambitions as Wall Street baulked at its heavy losses, complicated corporate structure, and founder Adam Neumann\u2019s grip on the company. It had been planning an investor roadshow to market the shares this week, ahead of a trading debut next week - but this is now on pause. This is obviously a blow to the company, which had been under pressure to complete the IPO to unlock new funding. As the Financial Times puts it: The delay to the IPO will also block WeWork from accessing a $6bn loan that had been provided by a consortium of banks, contingent on a successful IPO this year. If WeWork is unable to finalise its listing in 2019 it could be forced to draw up new financing plans. While the company is still set to receive a $1.5bn capital injection from SoftBank in 2020 as part of an earlier agreed deal, the cash cost of its global expansion has depleted its reserves and proven a key issue for investors. Traders will also have a eye on the UK Supreme Court. Eleven of Britain\u2019s top judges will hear today whether Boris Johnson acted unlawfully when he advised the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks. The agenda 10am BST: ZEW survey of German investor confidence 2.15pm BST: US industrial production figures for August (forecast to rise by 0.2%, up from -0.2%).",

      "bodyText": "Young British victims of human trafficking who have been forced to sell drugs in county lines operations are being charged and prosecuted despite guidelines against doing so, the Guardian can reveal. The Modern Slavery Act gives young people and vulnerable adults the right to raise a \u201csection 45\u201d defence, which states they were trafficked and forced to commit offences. The Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s (CPS) internal policy states that where a child or young person might have been trafficked and exploited through criminal activity there is a strong public interest in stopping the prosecution. But the Guardian has identified a series of cases where the CPS has continued to prosecute British children and young adults for county lines despite having a positive decision from the national referral mechanism (NRM) that designates them a victim of human trafficking, or being strongly suspected of being a victim of human trafficking. As lawyers and campaigners expressed their alarm at the findings, a Guardian investigation found cases including: A teenage boy with a learning disability convicted after being found to be in possession of drugs, despite the police finding threatening text messages on his mobile phones that showed he was being instructed by someone else. After he served his sentence, he was referred to the NRM and got a positive decision. The gang had, however, found the boy and retrafficked him and he was arrested again for offences relating to their drug-dealing operation. Despite the positive NRM decision and the fact he repeatedly told police the same gang had forced him to commit the offence, the CPS pursued a prosecution. He was acquitted. A young adult, whose defence lawyer said had clearly been groomed by a gang, who went to court without an NRM referral. When asked why a referral had not been made, the prosecuting counsel stated it was not the police\u2019s job to provide his defence. When raised in open court, the judge admitted he did not understand how the NRM operated and initially suggested defence lawyers should address their concerns to the jury. The CPS eventually dropped the case, but by then the boy had been in custody for several months with some of those involved in exploiting him. A 17-year-old with multiple special needs arrested in possession of a large amount of cash and class A drugs. The boy was receiving a minimal education at a pupil referral unit, where one of the professionals working with him had raised concerns about his association with older people who were linked to drug-related activities.

But they have a duty to investigate, not to wait for them to give that information.\u201d A National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council spokesman said: \u201cThere has been a substantial change in how police forces deal with modern slavery over the past several years. \u201cThousands of officers have been trained to spot signs of modern slavery and more than 1,200 specialist investigators have also been trained to deal with complex modern slavery cases, including carrying out evidence-led investigations where victims may not be able or willing to participate in the process of bringing offenders to justice.\u201d A CPS spokesperson said that the exploitation of children and vulnerable adults for criminal purposes was \u201cabhorrent\u201d and would continue to be prosecuted. \u201cThe identification of suspects as victims themselves can be challenging as many choose not to reveal the truth of their situations through fear, poor advice or other reasons,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWhile our guidance states it may not be in the public interest to prosecute someone who has been exploited, we must also take care that criminals are not able to unscrupulously use this as a defence.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Adil Rashid is due to sit down with Yorkshire to discuss his future amid thoughts of a return to white-ball specialism in order to prolong his playing career. Rashid, 31, has not featured for club or country since the World Cup final in July because of the chronic right shoulder injury that required painkilling injections to nurse him throughout the victorious campaign. The leg-spinner sees a 12-month all-format contract at Headingley expire at the end of the season, one that sat under the Test deal he was handed by England last summer after being talked out of a break from first-class cricket to feature in the series against India. But with Ashley Giles, the director of England cricket, set to reveal his centrally contracted players for 2019-20 this Friday \u2013 and Rashid expected to feature only among the white\u2011ball cricketers \u2013 he faces another crossroads. Rashid, whose last Test came in Barbados at the start of the year, told the Guardian: \u201cI would love to [get another Test deal] but I don\u2019t know what their vision is for me. I thought I did OK in the games I played but we got smashed by West Indies in the first Test in January and I haven\u2019t played since. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get one, I need to decide what to do next. Is it focusing on white-ball cricket again? With the injury, I do need to think about my longevity. Whatever happens, I\u2019ll always be thankful to Ed Smith [the national selector] and Joe Root [the Test captain] and the coaches for giving me the chance.\u201d Rashid\u2019s injury is more serious than some have made out. When he tried to return in the T20 Blast in August, the pain-masking injections from the World Cup had worn off. With an impingement in the joint and ligament damage, two months of rest was prescribed in order to be ready for the winter tours. In contrast to the joyous scenes after the World Cup when, as a key member of Eoin Morgan\u2019s one-day side, he received a hero\u2019s welcome in his home city of Bradford, the reaction to his injury on social media was mixed. There were claims from supporters that Rashid had \u201cno interest\u201d in the club, he was \u201clazy\u201d, had a \u201cchronic attitude problem\u201d and it was time to \u201cget rid\u201d. The club stating that he \u201cdeclared himself unfit\u201d before the full diagnosis did not help. \u201cI was upset about that,\u201d Rashid said. \u201cThe way it was phrased meant some people could perceive it as me not wanting to play for the club. But that\u2019s not true. I was really looking forward to the T20s. \u201cI could barely lift my arm \u2013 it was that bad. The bone was rubbing in the socket and there are [ligament] tears in there too. The England doctors confirmed the injury. And I couldn\u2019t have any more injections. I have just got to do it the hard way, which is two months of rest.\u201d There is history behind the scepticism, stemming back to the County Championship decider against Middlesex at Lord\u2019s in 2016 and a defeat that denied Yorkshire three titles in a row. It is hard not to wonder whether, like recent events, the way this played out publicly was slightly unfair on the leg-spinner. Rashid was one of three England players who was down to rest before an epic tour to Bangladesh and India that departed the following week. Yet unlike Root, centrally contracted, and Jonny Bairstow, about to start one himself, he did not have England to absorb the blame for him. It was also the biggest opportunity of his Test career \u2013 seven near\u2011guaranteed matches on the spin-friendly tracks of the subcontinent \u2013 but when the club asked him to reconsider, a family illness was also unfolding in the buildup to his departure overseas and he felt unable to change tack. Rashid explained: \u201cThat decision was bigger than cricket \u2013 it was life or death. My grandma was on her death bed and I was going away on tour the next week. Looking back, I\u2019m still happy I made that decision. All the decisions I make with Yorkshire and my career, I never regret. \u201cFor Yorkshire fans who still don\u2019t accept that, that\u2019s their problem. There are some for me, some against. Sometimes it can be upsetting and I think: \u2018Why am I singled out?\u2019 You have doubts in your head about the reasons. \u201cBut myself and Yorkshire, we\u2019re on good terms at the moment. You can have a bit of bad engagement or disagreements over time but as long as you get back on the same page, that\u2019s all that matters. I enjoy playing for Yorkshire and see myself representing Yorkshire in future.\u201d Yorkshire have told the Guardian they feel the same. Despite the outside noise, Rashid is highly regarded at the club \u2013 one senior club official described him as \u201clow maintenance\u201d \u2013 and they hope to sign him up for the Headingley 100\u2011ball team, too.

Deadstock \u2013 unsold clothes from past seasons \u2013 is a buzzword all of a sudden. Backstage after the Preen show on Sunday morning, the designer Justin Thornton told me that some pieces in the collection would be made in limited runs, as they were being produced \u201cout of deadstock we had in the studio from old seasons, that we wanted to reuse rather than buying new fabric\u201d.

Curated edits of pre-loved clothes are emerging as a model to bring hanger-appeal and contemporary relevance to secondhand clothes. At its most upscale, this can mean vintage Paris fashion hand-picked by Marie Blanchet at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/11/non-to-retro-the-parisian-guide-to-vintage-fashion\" title=\"\">William Vintage</a>. But it can also be rented designer pieces from MyWardrobe.com, from where you can borrow a Gucci handbag or a Burberry trenchcoat, boosting your wardrobe and the circular economy at the same time. Also on the rise is peer-to-peer rental on Hurr Collective, where a week\u2019s rental of a new designer piece is usually around 15% of the retail price.</p> <p>It has become fashionable to predict that the future of fashion is the end of trends, but I\u2019m not convinced. Watching models in white sunglasses and silk headscarves dance in feathered minidresses and foxy tailoring by the British luxury brand 16Arlington at its show this weekend, where the collection was inspired by the glamour of 1960s Italy, reminded me how evocative and desirable a retro look can be. These clothes were newly made, but a vintage-oriented fashion mindset could take such a show as a jumping-off point to fall back in love with old pieces in a wardrobe, an attic, or a secondhand store. With the future not looking all that pretty, nostalgia could be a rising stock. Fashion isn\u2019t going away any time soon. But to keep pace with the zeitgeist, it needs to smarten up its act.</p>",

A pivot away from new clothes doesn\u2019t mean the end of fashion. Curated edits of pre-loved clothes are emerging as a model to bring hanger-appeal and contemporary relevance to secondhand clothes. At its most upscale, this can mean vintage Paris fashion hand-picked by Marie Blanchet at William Vintage. But it can also be rented designer pieces from MyWardrobe.com, from where you can borrow a Gucci handbag or a Burberry trenchcoat, boosting your wardrobe and the circular economy at the same time. Also on the rise is peer-to-peer rental on Hurr Collective, where a week\u2019s rental of a new designer piece is usually around 15% of the retail price. It has become fashionable to predict that the future of fashion is the end of trends, but I\u2019m not convinced. Watching models in white sunglasses and silk headscarves dance in feathered minidresses and foxy tailoring by the British luxury brand 16Arlington at its show this weekend, where the collection was inspired by the glamour of 1960s Italy, reminded me how evocative and desirable a retro look can be. These clothes were newly made, but a vintage-oriented fashion mindset could take such a show as a jumping-off point to fall back in love with old pieces in a wardrobe, an attic, or a secondhand store. With the future not looking all that pretty, nostalgia could be a rising stock. Fashion isn\u2019t going away any time soon. But to keep pace with the zeitgeist, it needs to smarten up its act.",

      "body": "<p>L<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/last-tango-in-paris\">ast Tango in Paris</a>, Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s controversial piece of 70s art cinema, begins with an oil painting of a man on a red bed wearing just a T-shirt, flashing fleshy legs as his face explodes in inky smears. He\u2019s in a room with a green carpet and yellow walls. For a few moments, Bertolucci shows just this portrait \u2013 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/freud\">Lucian Freud</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon\">Francis Bacon</a> \u2013 then a sensual jazz score slowly starts, and the film\u2019s opening credits roll alongside this unmoving canvas. It is succeeded by a brutally dissected female figure sitting on a wooden chair \u2013 another Bacon portrait, this time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jan/08/guardianobituaries2\">Henrietta Moraes</a>. Eventually, the two paintings are seen side by side. Then we cut to Marlon Brando in a camel overcoat on a Paris bridge, yelling: \u201cFucking God!\u201d</p> <p>Behind Bertolucci\u2019s eerie use of these oil paintings is the shocking story of an art exhibition that gripped Paris, established Bacon as the great European artist he had always dreamt of being \u2013 and left a man dead in a hotel toilet. Bertolucci was so astounded by Bacon\u2019s solo show at the Grand Palais \u2013 which opened in October 1971, just as he was preparing to make his film in the French capital \u2013 that he took Brando to see it. He urged the actor, he later recalled, to \u201ccompare himself with Bacon\u2019s human figures because I felt that, like them, Marlon\u2019s face and body were characterised by a strange and infernal plasticity\u201d.</p> <p>This unsettling quality did not limit itself to those two works. The seedily magnificent <a href=\"https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/crgb5kG/rMxekL\">Three Figures in a Room</a>, a triptych of two-metre-tall canvases painted in 1964, has enough infernal plasticity to fill anyone\u2019s nightmares. On the left, a man sits naked on the toilet with his back to us. He seems to have no bones except for a line of vertebrae that poke out through his pink, orange and blue skin, which struggles to contain a spilling spread of relaxed muscle. The man\u2019s buttocks fit like a plug into the white porcelain.</p> <p>The first visitors to the hit retrospective had no idea how uncannily relevant this seven-year-old image was to Bacon\u2019s private anguish. Three Figures in a Room was one of many paintings of the artist\u2019s lover, <a href=\"https://francis-bacon.com/life/family-friends-sitters/george-dyer\">George Dyer</a>, that stole the show. But on 24 October, two days before the exhibition opened, staff at the H\u00f4tel des Saints P\u00e8res found Dyer\u2019s corpse slumped on the toilet. He died from a deliberate overdose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"059ccda76bb5ca294ce7da8995cb0bf91f84e1a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/059ccda76bb5ca294ce7da8995cb0bf91f84e1a7/0_0_2606_3507/743.jpg\" alt=\"Right panel from the triptych In Memory of George Dyer, 1971.\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Too nice to be a successful criminal\u2019 \u2026 right panel from the triptych In Memory of George Dyer, 1971.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estate of Francis Bacon/All rights reserved/Adagp, Paris, and DACS, London, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The peculiar impact Bacon\u2019s art made in Paris, and the violent death that shadowed his success, made this exhibition the defining moment of his art and life. Its spectre is now returning to haunt Paris. This autumn, the Pompidou Centre is mounting <a href=\"https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/agenda/event.action?param.id=FR_R-98422f4ec997b38e22b5fcc316c6dff7&amp;param.idSource=FR_E-98422f4ec997b38e22b5fcc316c6dff7\">a new Bacon blockbuster</a>. It starts by revisiting the Grand Palais show and explores how, from that point until Bacon\u2019s death in 1992, he meditated on Greek tragedy and modern poetry as he repeatedly painted triptychs in memory of Dyer.</p> <p>It was Georges Pompidou, the cultured former president of France whose memorial is the much-loved arts centre, who officially opened the Grand Palais exhibition and was given a tour by Bacon. It\u2019s hard to imagine former British PMs Harold Wilson or Ted Heath taking a similar interest in these outrageous paintings of the tragic human creature. Margaret Thatcher allegedly called Bacon \u201cthat man who paints those dreadful pictures\u201d. But this was France. And Bacon and Paris were made for each other.</p> <p>In this city, with its rich and sleazy avant-garde traditions going back to poets Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud in the 19th century, Bacon was seen in a completely different context from the grey and conservative Britain, where he\u2019d made his name in the 1950s. Like his beloved friend Lucian Freud, he was adept at appealing to British taste with portraits that, however radical, were recognisable and so more acceptable to the sceptical postwar British audience than, say, the abstract American paintings he himself sneered at as \u201cold lace\u201d. But in Paris, the true modernity and extremity of his art needed no humanist veneer. In the city of sex and death, Bacon was completely at home.</p> <p>A photograph of Bacon at the Grand Palais opening offers a glimpse of the French tradition of dirty modernism he so easily slid into. <a href=\"https://www.mbartfoundation.com/en/the-artist/biography/the-grand-palais-retrospective-in-paris/\">It shows him chatting to two white-haired surrealist painters, Andr\u00e9 Masson and Joan Mir\u00f3</a>. Such titans of the prewar Parisian scene were still alive in 1971 \u2013 but Masson connects us with a much earlier outrage. When the wealthy psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan bought Gustave Courbet\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/feb/08/gustave-courbet-origin-world-art\">The Origin of the World</a>, he decided this almost anatomical painting of a woman\u2019s sex organs should have a \u201ccover\u201d, just like erotic paintings in earlier ages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e700e6f293a0caa1bf76d7eff4a657e47ceec52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e700e6f293a0caa1bf76d7eff4a657e47ceec52/0_0_10267_6944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Modernity and extremity \u2026 Francis Bacon in 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Modernity and extremity \u2026 Francis Bacon in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Masson painted <a href=\"https://www.lacan.com/courbet.htm\">a ghostly outline of Courbet\u2019s nude</a> on a wooden panel that slid over the then secret masterpiece. It\u2019s an episode that typifies the way sex, preferably of a highly disreputable variety, was cherished as a subversive force by French artists, writers and intellectuals from Courbet to the surrealist movement to its epitaph in Last Tango in Paris. Bacon was intensely aware of this culture, which connected left-bank bookshops with fleapit hotels. His friend and model, the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/26/isabel-rawsthorne-art-dance-exhibition\">Isabel Rawsthorne</a>, even had an affair with the decadent surrealist writer Georges Bataille, whose 1928 novel Story of the Eye climaxes with the eyeball of a murdered priest being used as a sex toy.</p> <p>In short, Paris was ready for Bacon, and he gave it what it wanted. He included his own equivalent of The Origin of the World among the 100-plus paintings at the Grand Palais: <a href=\"https://www.francis-bacon.com/artworks/paintings/two-figures\">Two Figures</a>, which has the feel of a revelation. A door has opened on a dark bedroom where, on roughly painted white sheets, two naked men have been caught having sex. The man on top leers out of the painting as he and his companion enjoy themselves with animal abandon. It\u2019s one of his greatest paintings, and it could be appreciated in Paris in a way that was still difficult for Britain in 1971.</p> <p>However, it was Bacon\u2019s more recent paintings that defined the show. The star of many of these was a small-time criminal from London\u2019s East End who became Bacon\u2019s lover in 1963. George Dyer came from such a habitually law-breaking family that he remembered his mother trying to rob his pocket money. But he was too \u201cnice\u201d, lamented Bacon, to be a successful criminal. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Realising he couldn\u2019t directly bid for Picasso\u2019s crown unless he painted the female body, Bacon got in training</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The artist could easily afford to keep Dyer out of trouble. Born in Dublin in 1909, Bacon didn\u2019t see artistic success until he painted his wartime nightmare of twisted gargoyles, Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. This was around 1944. By the 60s, with a string of screaming popes behind him, he was rich. Working in a tiny bedsit studio in Kensington, London, he spent his earnings on champagne, fine wines and seafood feasts for his Soho friends. Dyer became part of this slightly desperate bohemia. He went from being a good-looking, well-dressed, would-be gangster to a depressed and clingy alcoholic. As Picasso\u2019s women had found, being a muse sucks.</p> <p>And there was Dyer\u2019s physique smeared all over the Grand Palais in blue, black and livid red. In the triptych <a href=\"https://www.francis-bacon.com/artworks/paintings/three-studies-male-back\">Three Studies of the Male Back</a>, Dyer sits naked in a swivel chair in front of a small, hand-held shaving mirror and a larger rectangular one. Two of the paintings in the triptych show his reflected face as he shaves: it is sharp and hooked, with slicked hair and eyes narrowed and turned away from us. Bacon famously based his popes on Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Portrait of Innocent X \u2013 and this enigmatic face in a mirror echoes another Vel\u00e1zquez painting that was kept just a short stroll from Soho: Rokeby Venus in the National Gallery.</p> <p>Dyer\u2019s back in this triptych is a loose, curvaceous landscape of bone and flesh. It looks as if his skeleton is not joined together but floats independently: a shoulder blade, a spinal column, bulging out of skin that\u2019s soft white and rose, or bruised grey. His neck is massive, his legs roly-poly, his muscles both soft and hard. It is an unabashedly erotic study of male beauty that takes direct inspiration from some of Bacon\u2019s favourite works of art: the drawings of Michelangelo, in which the male back is similarly idolised.</p> <p>Casually erudite references to Vel\u00e1zquez and Michelangelo go naturally with views of people on the toilet in Bacon\u2019s art. He said his was a \u201cgilded gutter life\u201d, veering between luxury and squalor. That is also true of his paintings as they mix base details with subtle textures and colours, all in sumptuous canvases that echo the old masters. At the Grand Palais, he was striving for greatness, determined to secure a place in the pantheon of high art. He may have chatted to various famous artists at the opening, but there was only one living painter he really wanted to be compared with: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/pablo-picasso\">Picasso</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c848e5f72fa91fb38e7ed73c3222ec9c0eee72ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c848e5f72fa91fb38e7ed73c3222ec9c0eee72ba/0_0_6000_2704/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a triptych inspired by TS Eliot\u2019s poem, Sweeney Agonistes, 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"451\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paean to poetry \u2026 a triptych inspired by TS Eliot\u2019s Sweeney Agonistes, 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cathy Carver/Estate of Francis Bacon/All rights reserved/Adagp, Paris, and DACS, London, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bacon\u2019s critical champion in Paris, who wrote the key essay in the exhibition catalogue, was the surrealist writer Michel Leiris, who was also a close friend of Picasso. According to Leiris, there was a clear connection between the two artists. A 1936 Picasso canvas called <a href=\"https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cR5d8Gz/rzyg6qx\">Sleeping Nude Woman</a>, which belonged to Leiris and is now in the Pompidou collection, reveals how the men shared a visceral, even obscene surrealism. Picasso distorts female anatomy at will to get a view of his model that\u2019s sheer sensual graffiti. Bacon does the same in his views of Dyer. But he took on Picasso more directly in the years before his Paris show.</p> <p>Realising that he couldn\u2019t bid for the Spaniard\u2019s crown unless he painted the female body, Bacon got in training. To help him prepare for <a href=\"https://www.francis-bacon.com/artworks/paintings/henrietta-moraes\">his 1966 nude Henrietta Moraes</a>, a work that would stun visitors to the Grand Palais, the hard-drinking photographer John Deakin took a series of \u201ccandid\u201d pictures of her \u2013 including ones he sold around Soho, much to her amusement. The resulting painting is one of the greatest nudes of the 20th century \u2013 and a bizarrely empowering one.

      "bodyText": "Last Tango in Paris, Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s controversial piece of 70s art cinema, begins with an oil painting of a man on a red bed wearing just a T-shirt, flashing fleshy legs as his face explodes in inky smears. He\u2019s in a room with a green carpet and yellow walls. For a few moments, Bertolucci shows just this portrait \u2013 of Lucian Freud by Francis Bacon \u2013 then a sensual jazz score slowly starts, and the film\u2019s opening credits roll alongside this unmoving canvas. It is succeeded by a brutally dissected female figure sitting on a wooden chair \u2013 another Bacon portrait, this time of Henrietta Moraes. Eventually, the two paintings are seen side by side. Then we cut to Marlon Brando in a camel overcoat on a Paris bridge, yelling: \u201cFucking God!\u201d Behind Bertolucci\u2019s eerie use of these oil paintings is the shocking story of an art exhibition that gripped Paris, established Bacon as the great European artist he had always dreamt of being \u2013 and left a man dead in a hotel toilet. Bertolucci was so astounded by Bacon\u2019s solo show at the Grand Palais \u2013 which opened in October 1971, just as he was preparing to make his film in the French capital \u2013 that he took Brando to see it. He urged the actor, he later recalled, to \u201ccompare himself with Bacon\u2019s human figures because I felt that, like them, Marlon\u2019s face and body were characterised by a strange and infernal plasticity\u201d. This unsettling quality did not limit itself to those two works. The seedily magnificent Three Figures in a Room, a triptych of two-metre-tall canvases painted in 1964, has enough infernal plasticity to fill anyone\u2019s nightmares. On the left, a man sits naked on the toilet with his back to us. He seems to have no bones except for a line of vertebrae that poke out through his pink, orange and blue skin, which struggles to contain a spilling spread of relaxed muscle. The man\u2019s buttocks fit like a plug into the white porcelain. The first visitors to the hit retrospective had no idea how uncannily relevant this seven-year-old image was to Bacon\u2019s private anguish. Three Figures in a Room was one of many paintings of the artist\u2019s lover, George Dyer, that stole the show. But on 24 October, two days before the exhibition opened, staff at the H\u00f4tel des Saints P\u00e8res found Dyer\u2019s corpse slumped on the toilet. He died from a deliberate overdose. The peculiar impact Bacon\u2019s art made in Paris, and the violent death that shadowed his success, made this exhibition the defining moment of his art and life. Its spectre is now returning to haunt Paris. This autumn, the Pompidou Centre is mounting a new Bacon blockbuster. It starts by revisiting the Grand Palais show and explores how, from that point until Bacon\u2019s death in 1992, he meditated on Greek tragedy and modern poetry as he repeatedly painted triptychs in memory of Dyer. It was Georges Pompidou, the cultured former president of France whose memorial is the much-loved arts centre, who officially opened the Grand Palais exhibition and was given a tour by Bacon. It\u2019s hard to imagine former British PMs Harold Wilson or Ted Heath taking a similar interest in these outrageous paintings of the tragic human creature. Margaret Thatcher allegedly called Bacon \u201cthat man who paints those dreadful pictures\u201d. But this was France. And Bacon and Paris were made for each other. In this city, with its rich and sleazy avant-garde traditions going back to poets Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud in the 19th century, Bacon was seen in a completely different context from the grey and conservative Britain, where he\u2019d made his name in the 1950s. Like his beloved friend Lucian Freud, he was adept at appealing to British taste with portraits that, however radical, were recognisable and so more acceptable to the sceptical postwar British audience than, say, the abstract American paintings he himself sneered at as \u201cold lace\u201d. But in Paris, the true modernity and extremity of his art needed no humanist veneer. In the city of sex and death, Bacon was completely at home. A photograph of Bacon at the Grand Palais opening offers a glimpse of the French tradition of dirty modernism he so easily slid into. It shows him chatting to two white-haired surrealist painters, Andr\u00e9 Masson and Joan Mir\u00f3. Such titans of the prewar Parisian scene were still alive in 1971 \u2013 but Masson connects us with a much earlier outrage. When the wealthy psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan bought Gustave Courbet\u2019s The Origin of the World, he decided this almost anatomical painting of a woman\u2019s sex organs should have a \u201ccover\u201d, just like erotic paintings in earlier ages. So Masson painted a ghostly outline of Courbet\u2019s nude on a wooden panel that slid over the then secret masterpiece. It\u2019s an episode that typifies the way sex, preferably of a highly disreputable variety, was cherished as a subversive force by French artists, writers and intellectuals from Courbet to the surrealist movement to its epitaph in Last Tango in Paris. Bacon was intensely aware of this culture, which connected left-bank bookshops with fleapit hotels. His friend and model, the artist Isabel Rawsthorne, even had an affair with the decadent surrealist writer Georges Bataille, whose 1928 novel Story of the Eye climaxes with the eyeball of a murdered priest being used as a sex toy. In short, Paris was ready for Bacon, and he gave it what it wanted. He included his own equivalent of The Origin of the World among the 100-plus paintings at the Grand Palais: Two Figures, which has the feel of a revelation. A door has opened on a dark bedroom where, on roughly painted white sheets, two naked men have been caught having sex. The man on top leers out of the painting as he and his companion enjoy themselves with animal abandon. It\u2019s one of his greatest paintings, and it could be appreciated in Paris in a way that was still difficult for Britain in 1971. However, it was Bacon\u2019s more recent paintings that defined the show. The star of many of these was a small-time criminal from London\u2019s East End who became Bacon\u2019s lover in 1963. George Dyer came from such a habitually law-breaking family that he remembered his mother trying to rob his pocket money. But he was too \u201cnice\u201d, lamented Bacon, to be a successful criminal. The artist could easily afford to keep Dyer out of trouble. Born in Dublin in 1909, Bacon didn\u2019t see artistic success until he painted his wartime nightmare of twisted gargoyles, Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. This was around 1944. By the 60s, with a string of screaming popes behind him, he was rich. Working in a tiny bedsit studio in Kensington, London, he spent his earnings on champagne, fine wines and seafood feasts for his Soho friends. Dyer became part of this slightly desperate bohemia. He went from being a good-looking, well-dressed, would-be gangster to a depressed and clingy alcoholic. As Picasso\u2019s women had found, being a muse sucks. And there was Dyer\u2019s physique smeared all over the Grand Palais in blue, black and livid red. In the triptych Three Studies of the Male Back, Dyer sits naked in a swivel chair in front of a small, hand-held shaving mirror and a larger rectangular one. Two of the paintings in the triptych show his reflected face as he shaves: it is sharp and hooked, with slicked hair and eyes narrowed and turned away from us. Bacon famously based his popes on Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Portrait of Innocent X \u2013 and this enigmatic face in a mirror echoes another Vel\u00e1zquez painting that was kept just a short stroll from Soho: Rokeby Venus in the National Gallery. Dyer\u2019s back in this triptych is a loose, curvaceous landscape of bone and flesh. It looks as if his skeleton is not joined together but floats independently: a shoulder blade, a spinal column, bulging out of skin that\u2019s soft white and rose, or bruised grey. His neck is massive, his legs roly-poly, his muscles both soft and hard. It is an unabashedly erotic study of male beauty that takes direct inspiration from some of Bacon\u2019s favourite works of art: the drawings of Michelangelo, in which the male back is similarly idolised. Casually erudite references to Vel\u00e1zquez and Michelangelo go naturally with views of people on the toilet in Bacon\u2019s art. He said his was a \u201cgilded gutter life\u201d, veering between luxury and squalor. That is also true of his paintings as they mix base details with subtle textures and colours, all in sumptuous canvases that echo the old masters. At the Grand Palais, he was striving for greatness, determined to secure a place in the pantheon of high art. He may have chatted to various famous artists at the opening, but there was only one living painter he really wanted to be compared with: Picasso. Bacon\u2019s critical champion in Paris, who wrote the key essay in the exhibition catalogue, was the surrealist writer Michel Leiris, who was also a close friend of Picasso. According to Leiris, there was a clear connection between the two artists. A 1936 Picasso canvas called Sleeping Nude Woman, which belonged to Leiris and is now in the Pompidou collection, reveals how the men shared a visceral, even obscene surrealism. Picasso distorts female anatomy at will to get a view of his model that\u2019s sheer sensual graffiti. Bacon does the same in his views of Dyer. But he took on Picasso more directly in the years before his Paris show. Realising that he couldn\u2019t bid for the Spaniard\u2019s crown unless he painted the female body, Bacon got in training. To help him prepare for his 1966 nude Henrietta Moraes, a work that would stun visitors to the Grand Palais, the hard-drinking photographer John Deakin took a series of \u201ccandid\u201d pictures of her \u2013 including ones he sold around Soho, much to her amusement. The resulting painting is one of the greatest nudes of the 20th century \u2013 and a bizarrely empowering one. Moraes lies with her feet towards us on a bed, her hips majestic, her right arm slung back, her animal-mask face unmistakably echoing Picasso\u2019s Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon. Bacon was bidding to be recognised for what he was: the most visionary painter of human beings since Picasso. He was not going to let a private tragedy spoil that. His relationship with Dyer was all but over. He had been giving his broken muse money to make up for the end of their affair. But it seems Dyer was eager to see so many paintings of himself on show in Paris, and they patched things up \u2013 briefly. When Dyer was discovered dead, Bacon\u2019s friends worked with the French authorities to keep the suicide secret. The conspiracy was so effective that until 2016 Bacon\u2019s biographers were repeating the fiction that he heard of the horror only on the day of the opening. He actually kept his cool for a full 36 hours before the launch, to save the show \u2013 and his career. Was Dyer\u2019s death intended as an act of sabotage, motivated by revenge? Or was the reason for his suicide pure grief? Bacon did go on to give Dyer his due, and more, in tragic paintings that return obsessively to that death in a Paris hotel, but there\u2019s no need to sentimentalise him or his art to see his greatness. The truth is that when the news broke, this sad death seemed only to confirm the desolate, harrowing vision so powerfully laid bare at the Grand Palais. Bacon, an avowed atheist, shows human life as pure animality. We\u2019re bodies without souls. His modernism is pitiless. And at that momentous show in Paris in 1971, it thrust him into the pantheon of European art. \u2022 Bacon en toutes lettres is at the Pompidou Centre, Paris, until 20 January.",

      "bodyText": "BIG CUP IS BACK, BABY! And then there were 32. After a total of 91 matches in its preliminary rounds, qualifiers and play-offs, Big Cup proper is finally back. While your Queen\u2019s Celtics, your Feronikelis and your Slovan Bratislavas have been consigned to the dustbin of domestic competition or Big Vase, Europe\u2019s elite \u2013 and the 16 other teams in there to make up the numbers \u2013 prepare to duke it out in the group stages. Ah, the group stages: 96 largely pointless and hugely predictable matches across eight groups in a complete waste of almost everybody\u2019s time when history suggests that the 16 with the most money should just about be ushered through to the knockout stages. \u201cYeah but what about Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, who nearly didn\u2019t make it but still ended up contesting the final?\u201d yeah-but-what-about Big Cup\u2019s group stage cheerleaders, waving their Uefa-issue Gazprom-branded pom-poms and apparently oblivious to the incredible amount of heavy lifting being done by the word \u2018nearly\u2019 in their self-defeating arguments. Nearly never bulled a cow, as Weird Uncle Fiver fails to tire of reminding us, although if anyone can get one to do so it\u2019s probably him. Speaking of Liverpool, the defending champions are in Italy for a tricky opener against Napoli and both teams will kick off knowing the consequences of defeat for either side will be \u2026 almost totally inconsequential. Of course that won\u2019t stop BT Sport giving it the big licks, mind, for a likely group-stage match audience of a tumbleweed rolling through an abandoned western town. J\u00fcrgen Klopp insists his players have not had their heads turned or swollen by last season\u2019s success. \u201cAfter that, of course, if you start taking drugs, drinking, buying new cars and leaving your wife, then it gets harder,\u201d he said at his press conference, his notoriously blingtastic captain Jordan Henderson sitting beside him surrounded by an entourage of fawning flunkies and wearing a mink stole and a golden crown. Meanwhile at Stamford Bridge, Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea\u2019s Frank Lampard makes his managerial bow in Big Cup as they entertain Spanish footballing basket cases Valencia, who have been plunged into their worst crisis since owner Peter Lim stuck a managerial contract under Gary Neville\u2019s nose and handed him a pen. In another act of apparent self-sabotage, the Singapore-based businessman has just sacked a vastly superior gaffer in Marcelino, following a power struggle that played out over the summer. The upshot? Having got spanked by Barcelona over the weekend, Valencia travelled to London with a new boss in Albert Celades. And so miffed are his players by the decision to fire his predecessor that they\u2019ve declared a media blackout, meaning that, unlike J\u00fcrgen, their hapless new boss was forced to conduct his press conference all alone beside a conspicuously empty chair. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Barry Glendenning from 8pm for hot MBM coverage of Napoli 2-2 Liverpool, while Simon Burnton will be on hand for Chelsea 1-1 Valencia. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThey did all the work and I took the glory, so it can\u2019t be any better\u201d \u2013 a mantra we can definitely get on board with, from Arsenal match-winner Dani\u00eblle van de Donk after her dramatic WSL winner at Manchester United. RECOMMENDED LOOKING This Star Wars-facing David Squires cartoon ended up provoking a chat involving trendy King\u2019s Lynn nightspot Dr Thirsty\u2019s. Sounds like Weird Uncle Fiver\u2019s shrink.

Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Rollover. BITS AND BOBS Neymar has had his three-match Big Cup ban for bellyaching about match officials after PSG\u2019s ignominious defeat by Manchester United last season downgraded a game by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The most interesting thing from Aston Villa 0-0 West Ham was Anwar El Ghazi as good as planting the nut on teammate Tyrone Mings. \u201cEl Ghazi has a little bit of red mist in him, like most professional footballers,\u201d parped Villa boss Dean Smith. Get well soon to former Hearts manager Jim Jeffries, who is recovering after a heart attack. And Macclesfield Town are taking action after a video emerged of staff members out in Swindon the night before Saturday\u2019s League Two defeat. \u201cThe four individuals have let the club, staff, players, themselves and our fans down massively,\u201d sniffed a club statement. \u201cThe individuals in question are being dealt with behind closed doors, as this type of behaviour is completely unacceptable.\u201d STILL WANT MORE? Sid Lowe on the nonsense at Valencia. Carlo Ancelotti has all the pieces in place. Now Napoli seek silverware, as Nicky Bandini reports. Andy Hunter is with the European champions as they launch their title defence. Suzanne Wrack on the alarming neglect of player welfare in the women\u2019s game. Banning fans\u2019 free speech is not consistent with our vision of sport, or democracy, warns Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Colbert \u201cYou know who I thought I would never be talking about again?\u201d Stephen Colbert asked on Monday night\u2019s Late Show. That would be Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who joined the supreme court nearly a year ago after a contentious confirmation process in which Dr Christine Blasey Ford told her story of sexual assault by Kavanaugh in high school. Kavanaugh denied her account, and was narrowly confirmed. \u201cSpecifically, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be talking about his penis again,\u201d said Colbert. But a new book published this week by the New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly unearthed new allegations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh: one of his former Yale classmates, Max Stier, told the FBI he recalled seeing Kavanaugh forcing his penis, with the help of his friends, into another female student\u2019s hand during a dorm party in college. \u201cWith the help of his friends?\u201d Colbert said incredulously. \u201cI can\u2019t even get mine to help me move. I offer penis \u2013\u201d Colbert cut off, doubling over in laughter. Several seconds, a musical interlude and one glasses removal later, Colbert attempted to finish the joke: \u201cI offer pizza with no penis, I promise you.\u201d The woman involved in this latest revelation has remained private, saying she has no recollection of the incident and does not want to be interviewed. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has predictably defended Kavanaugh online, tweeting over the weekend that Kavanaugh should sue for libel and the justice department \u201cshould come to his rescue\u201d. \u201cHow does the justice department come to his rescue?\u201d Colbert wondered. \u201cIs William Barr supposed to write a misleading four-page summary of his junk?\u201d Trevor Noah On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also reacted to new details of alleged misconduct by Kavanaugh. \u201cEvery high school story, or every college story we hear about Brett Kavanaugh, just makes him seem worse and worse,\u201d Noah said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s always something about him exposing himself.\u201d For example, last year, Kavanaugh\u2019s former Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez publicly recalled how, she said, Kavanaugh once thrust his penis in her face at a party.

In a statement on Twitter on Tuesday, Stokes said the paper\u2019s decision to publish the story would have \u201cgrave and lifelong consequences\u201d for his mother, in particular. He claimed the story, which was also picked up by Mail Online, contained a number of serious inaccuracies. \u201cToday the Sun has seen fit to publish extremely painful, sensitive and personal details concerning events in the private lives of my family, going back more than 31 years,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is hard to find words that adequately describe such low and despicable behaviour, disguised as journalism. I cannot conceive of anything more immoral, heartless or contemptuous to the feelings and circumstances of my family.\u201d Stokes criticised the article as \u201cthe lowest form of journalism, focused only on chasing sales\u201d and asked people to respect his family\u2019s privacy and right to home life. \u201cTo use my name as an excuse to shatter the privacy and private lives of \u2013 in particular \u2013 my parents is utterly disgusting,\u201d he wrote. The article described in detail events in New Zealand 31 years ago, before he was born, when his mother\u2019s ex-husband killed their two children before taking his own life. Stokes said a reporter had turned up at his parents\u2019 home in New Zealand \u201cout of the blue\u201d to ask them about the tragedy. The Sun reported that the couple and the cricketer had declined to comment. In his statement, Stokes said his own public profile was not an excuse to \u201cinvade\u201d the rights and privacy of his family members. He added: \u201cThis is the lowest form of journalism, focused only on chasing sales with absolutely no regard for the devastation caused to lives as a consequence. It is totally out of order.\u201d Tom Harrison, the England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive, also condemned the decision to publish the article. \u201cWe, like the wider sporting world, are disgusted and appalled at the actions taken in revealing the tragic events from Ben\u2019s past. We are saddened that an intrusion of this magnitude was deemed necessary in order to sell newspapers or secure clicks,\u201d he said. \u201cBen\u2019s exploits this summer have cemented his place in cricket\u2019s history. We are sure the whole sport, and the country, stands behind him in support.\u201d There was also support for Stokes from other cricketers and fans on Twitter. The England test captain, Joe Root, retweeted his teammate\u2019s statement and urged people to \u201cplease take the time to read this and respect it\u201d. Hacked Off, the campaign for media accountability, said: \u201cThis is an appalling invasion of privacy with no public interest justification. We have been told repeatedly by newspaper editors that \u2018everything has changed\u2019 since the Leveson report seven years ago. It is abundantly clear that nothing has changed. Some newspapers are just as incapable of abiding by principles of human decency and basic journalistic ethics as they were during the phone-hacking scandal.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Sun said: \u201cThe Sun has the utmost sympathy for Ben Stokes and his mother but it is only right to point out the story was told with the cooperation of a family member who supplied details, provided photographs and posed for pictures.

      "bodyText": "Atmospherically speaking, Brexit will certainly dominate Labour\u2019s conference, as it has for the Liberal Democrats, and will for the Tories. All the conversations outside the hall, in fringe meetings, on beaches, in pubs, either side of the karaoke (activists love microphones, no one knows why) will revolve around it. The \u201cLove Corbyn, Hate Brexit\u201d tote bags will have been updated. \u201cRemain, Reform, Revolt\u201d on one side, and \u2013 optimistically \u2013 \u201cLabour can stop Brexit\u201d on the other; there will be no shortage of views as to how. Labour is, with or without Jo Swinson\u2019s missteps, plainly the party of remain: in its membership and its voters; in its stated policy of backing a second referendum; in most of its MPs and the bulk of its shadow cabinet; in its visceral reaction to Boris Johnson and his crash-and-burn fantasies. Yet the leadership is still clinging to the dated electoral calculation that it can only win if they pick up votes from both leavers and remainers, and the idea that it is possible, if you\u2019re clever enough, to simultaneously support both outcomes. This will come to a head over the issue of a Labour-negotiated exit deal. The Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Organisation (Tulo) reiterated on Tuesday night their determination to go into an election with the promise of negotiating their own Left Brexit, then taking that to the public for a vote. This apparently makes sense within the union DNA, negotiating a deal, then advising their members to vote for or against it. It sure as hell doesn\u2019t make sense to anyone else, and it is not a tenable manifesto position, torching what should be their strongest argument: we can make this Tory-confected nightmare end. With John McDonnell now as openly pro-remain as he has ever been, this crack has snaked to the top of the party and cannot be papered over \u2013 especially with 91 motions submitted by constituency Labour parties (CLPs), the vast majority of which are calling for Labour to explicitly back remain. Remember the success of last year: 150 mainly pro-remain motions were composited in a tense, five-hour meeting into the single motion that Keir Starmer announced to a standing ovation: Labour became, in September 2018, a party that believed in a second referendum, with remain on the ballot. This is probably the most significant achievement any anti-Brexit campaign has ever managed, most of the other hurdles to Brexit having been erected by Brexiters themselves.

      "body": "<p>According to the writer and broadcaster Mark Lawson, it\u2019s time for soaps to tone things down. The likes of Coronation Street and EastEnders are in crisis, he says in the latest issue of the Radio Times, because they are \u201c[piling] catastrophe after crisis on the best-known characters\u201d in order to boost flagging ratings. \u201cAs other TV fiction has become busier and darker, perhaps the soaps need to aim lighter and slower,\u201d he adds. But, really, what would the fun be in that? Here are the most outlandish, most memorable soap plots of all time.</p> <h2>1. Neighbours <br>Harold Bishop returns</h2> <p>Surely a heart attack on the edge of a cliff would be enough to finish anyone off? However, drowning proved no biggie for Erinsborough\u2019s resident tuba fan, who was found five years later at a Salvation Army shop, having apparently been afflicted with amnesia and assumed the name Ted.</p> <h2>2. Crossroads <br>It was all a dream</h2> <p>The first rule of writing \u2013 do not, under any circumstances, use the words \u201cIt was all a dream\u201d \u2013 was flagrantly flouted by Crossroads.

      "bodyText": "According to the writer and broadcaster Mark Lawson, it\u2019s time for soaps to tone things down. The likes of Coronation Street and EastEnders are in crisis, he says in the latest issue of the Radio Times, because they are \u201c[piling] catastrophe after crisis on the best-known characters\u201d in order to boost flagging ratings. \u201cAs other TV fiction has become busier and darker, perhaps the soaps need to aim lighter and slower,\u201d he adds. But, really, what would the fun be in that? Here are the most outlandish, most memorable soap plots of all time. 1. Neighbours Harold Bishop returns Surely a heart attack on the edge of a cliff would be enough to finish anyone off? However, drowning proved no biggie for Erinsborough\u2019s resident tuba fan, who was found five years later at a Salvation Army shop, having apparently been afflicted with amnesia and assumed the name Ted. 2. Crossroads It was all a dream The first rule of writing \u2013 do not, under any circumstances, use the words \u201cIt was all a dream\u201d \u2013 was flagrantly flouted by Crossroads. The soap\u2019s early-00s revival, plagued by poor ratings, was explained away in its final episode as some kind of hallucination on the part of a supermarket worker, with the show\u2019s characters merely customers in the shop where she worked (yes, really). 3. Emmerdale Plane crash wipes out the village There have been few culls bigger than Emmerdale\u2019s fiery air disaster, which wiped out half of the cast and sent the formerly sleepy daytime soap into TV\u2019s big leagues. Corrie who? 4. Brookside Body under the patio When his wife, Mandy, could no longer stand his abuse, Trevor Jordache ended up six feet under in this infamous soap plot. However, an underground leak \u2013 and not, gladly, the weird stench of decomposing flesh \u2013 led to his discovery. 5. EastEnders Dirty Den returns Like Harold, Leslie Grantham\u2019s Den was presumed dead when he was caught up in some cut-price Krays business with \u201cthe Firm\u201d. But, 14 years later, it was revealed that, like many a Briton before him, he had faked his death and moved to Spain. 6. Dallas Dream season Not as bad as Crossroads yet still completely implausible, Dallas wrote off its entire 1985-86 season \u2013 including Bobby Ewing\u2019s highly unpopular death \u2013 by claiming it had all been the hyper-vivid dream of his wife, Pam. 7. Dallas Who Shot JR? The cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers, the shooting saga dragged on for eight months, via twists, turns and tie-in T-shirts. Around the world, 350 million people tuned in to find out the answer, which makes Line of Duty\u2019s viewing figures look paltry. 8. Neighbours It was all a dog\u2019s dream What\u2019s better (worse?) than \u201cit was all a dream\u201d? It was all a dog\u2019s dream, of course! Which is precisely what happened in Neighbours when pooch Bouncer enjoyed a totally normal romantic reverie. 9. Days of Our Lives Salem stalker A killing spree rocked the US soap in 2000, culminating in the perpetrator, Marlena, choking her final victim with a doughnut. The dead characters were subsequently revived and marooned on an island. And then the killer was revealed to be someone else. Because why not? 10. Coronation Street Tricky Dicky Slippery finance guy Richard Hillman ingratiated himself with Gail Platt and family, subsequently kidnapping, gaslighting and killing his way across Weatherfield. He eventually drove the Platts into a canal in his people carrier, but \u2013 luckily \u2013 the only fatality was Tricky Dicky himself. 11. Hollyoaks Twincest Incest. There\u2019s not really a good way to cover it. But if you\u2019ve got to do it, maybe having two characters have a one-night stand, completely forget one other and then find out that they are siblings \u2013 as tried out by Hollyoaks with Dodger and Sienna \u2013 is the most palatable option? 12.

The study, published in 2017, found an average of 10 million particles per millilitre in hundreds of nine-to-12-year-olds tested. \u201cIt shows there is translocation of particles from the lungs to all organ systems,\u201d said Nawrot. \u201cIt is really difficult to give people practical advice, because everyone has to breathe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what people can do is avoid busy roads as much as possible. There can be very high levels next to busy roads, but just a few metres away can be lower.\u201d Prof Jonathan Grigg, whose group presented the first report of particles in five placentas in September, welcomed the research and said the group\u2019s work had since been expanded and would be published soon. \u201cWe see evidence of particles in all women \u2013 it is not like it is a one-off,\u201d said Grigg at Queen Mary University of London in the UK. \u201cIt implies that every day we have these very small particles moving around our bodies.\u201d \u201cWe should be protecting foetuses and this is another reminder that we need to get [air pollution] levels down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people shouldn\u2019t be totally scared.\u201d He said the total weight of the tiny particles was small and more research was needed to determine their impact, but he advised people to use lower pollution transport optionsor public transport, rather than cars. Grigg said: \u201cThis new field of research certainly focuses our attention on the direct role of particles getting to the tissues, rather than particles getting into the lungs and releasing other [inflammatory] substances.\u201d Air pollution research now shows full scale bodily harm, from heart and lung disease to diabetes and reduced intelligence to brittle bones and damaged skin. The WHO calls air pollution a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d and recent analysis indicates 8.8 million early deaths each year, though scientists suspect even this may be \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d.",

Lee, a Korean-American artist, populated the stage with three women in traditional Korean dress and a fourth woman, Korean-American, who despises them. (There\u2019s also a very boring white couple.) An exquisitely uncomfortable exploration of bias, it also includes mimed suicides choreographed to Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas. Lee continued to explore themes of prejudice and stereotype in works such as The Shipment and Straight White Men, but this finds her at her most scurrilous and original. <strong>AS </strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/04/playwright-young-jean-lee-race-interview\">Read an interview</a>.</em></p> <h2>48</h2> <h2><strong>Mission Drift</strong> (2012)</h2> <p>Brilliantly collapsing time and space, the Team\u2019s dissection of US capitalism is one of the most theatrically ambitious shows of recent years.

It implied that the two men, in vastly different ways, needed each other. Frost, having lost his American and Australian programmes, was seeking to restore his dwindling fortunes, while Nixon craved public expiation of his Watergate sins.

Structured as a smarmy seaside variety entertainment, the show begins badly and gets much worse. There\u2019s a balloon-clad ecdysiast who runs off in tears, a doll who tortures his ventriloquist, a mentalist who predicts the death of most everyone watching.

Never indulgent or exploitative, this shattering play explores how women assert themselves in a world ruled by men who use rape and mutilation as weapons. Nottage\u2019s play never sanitises this violence, but it argues, via beautifully complicated characters, that survival, compassion and even love remain possible. <strong>AS</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/apr/23/ruined-michael-billington\">Read the review</a></em>.</p> <h2>33</h2> <h2><strong>Mr Burns</strong> (2012)</h2> <p>Much was made of Anne Washburn\u2019s decision to imagine The Simpsons surviving the collapse of human civilisation, but really Mr Burns is about how cultures evolve and reinvent. Almost regardless of whether it\u2019s Homer Simpson or the Homer of The Iliad who manages to escape apocalypse, the play wittily explores how these stories morph, mutate and lend meaning to human lives.

Jeanine Tesori\u2019s delectable melodies and Lisa Kron\u2019s lyrics, just on the elegant side of conversational, give the show a remarkable intimacy.

Like a heady mix of Luigi Pirandello and Tom Stoppard, the play opened up fascinating questions about the capacity of fictional figures to escape their author\u2019s control. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/08/the-watsons-review-minerva-chichester-jane-austen-laura-wade\">Read the review</a></em>.</p> <h2>21</h2> <h2><strong>Blackbird</strong> (2005)</h2> <p>David Harrower\u2019s disturbing play offers a riveting study of sexual obsession. It deals with a fraught confrontation between a 28-year-old woman and a 56-year-old man who, 15 years earlier, had enjoyed a criminally transgressive relationship. Harrower suspends moral judgment to question our knee-jerk assumptions about the nature of adult guilt and adolescent innocence. <strong>MB</strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/17/theatre.edinburghfestival2005\"> Read the review</a></em>.</p> <h2>20</h2> <h2><strong>Barber Shop Chronicles</strong> (2017)</h2> <p>Switching between six establishments in two continents on a single day, Inua Ellams\u2019s invigorating play showed how, for African men, barber shops are both pub and political platform. Soccer, social issues and the difficulties of father-son relationships were recurring themes. But the abiding image of Bijan Sheibani\u2019s production, which incorporated uplifting music and dance, was of the barber shop as a place where you shed your locks but discover your identity. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/08/barber-shop-chronicles-review-dorfman-theatre-london-national-inua-ellams\">Read the review</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6b537e01f3454813b0e86a93601678dc9be8e30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6b537e01f3454813b0e86a93601678dc9be8e30/193_843_3807_1824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Echoes of Shaw \u2026 Our Lady of Kibeho, with Rima Nsubuga, Michaela Blackburn, Pepter Lunkuse and Gabrielle Brooks at the Royal &amp; Derngate theatre, Northampton, in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Echoes of Shaw \u2026 Our Lady of Kibeho, with Rima Nsubuga, Michaela Blackburn, Pepter Lunkuse and Gabrielle Brooks at the Royal &amp; Derngate theatre, Northampton, in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>19</h2> <h2><strong>Our Lady of Kibeho</strong> (2014)</h2> <p>Katori Hall (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/23/katori-hall-the-mountaintop-review\">The Mountaintop</a>) turns the story of the Marian apparitions that visited a trio of Rwandan schoolgirls in 1981 into a religious and political drama with echoes of George Bernard Shaw\u2019s Saint Joan and Arthur Miller\u2019s The Crucible. Hall\u2019s great achievement is that, without necessarily validating the visions, she shows how they reflected the country\u2019s existing Tutsi-Hutu tensions and foresaw the horrific genocide to come. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/17/our-lady-of-kibeho-review-royal-and-derngate-northampton-katori-hall-rwanda\">Read the review</a></em>.</p> <h2>18</h2> <h2><strong>Enron</strong> (2009)</h2> <p>Lucy Prebble\u2019s was the first in a number of plays skewering corporate corruption following the financial crash.

Natasha Gordon took a theme explored by many other writers: what it means to lead a bicultural existence in which you are caught between immigrant tradition and the insistent present. Gordon gave it fizz and bounce by showing a London family\u2019s divided reaction to the Jamaican custom of a nine-night funeral wake. Nothing was more touching than the sight of the family\u2019s graduate daughter suspending her natural scepticism to acknowledge the power of her spiritual inheritance. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/01/nine-night-review-dorfman-national-theatre-london\">Read the review</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e1ea5ee727a96f9ee6bb1a42ad96e32be316ba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e1ea5ee727a96f9ee6bb1a42ad96e32be316ba4/15_5_2014_1208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Extraordinary \u2026 Bill Nighy in Blue/Orange, with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Andrew Lincoln.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extraordinary \u2026 Bill Nighy in Blue/Orange, with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Andrew Lincoln at the Cottesloe, London, in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>16</h2> <h2><strong>Blue/Orange</strong> (2000)</h2> <p>Joe Penhall\u2019s compassion for those marginalised by society was seen at its best in this extraordinary play. It showed a young black man, who believed oranges are blue and Idi Amin was his father, being used as a ping-pong ball by two warring, white medical practitioners. Penhall nailed several issues: the myth of a tolerant community ready to receive people with a personality disorder, the high incidence of mental illness among members of the African-Caribbean population and the idea that all professions are a conspiracy against the laity. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2000/apr/15/theatre.artsfeatures\">Read the review</a></em>.</p> <h2>15</h2> <h2><strong>The Inheritance</strong> (2018)</h2> <p>Modern drama seems to oscillate between the minimal and the maximal. Matthew Lopez\u2019s two-part, seven-hour play was emphatically in the latter camp. Dealing with the bitter inheritance of Aids and the spiritual qualities of a house, it was like a cross between Angels in America and Howards End. It teemed with narrative incident and impassioned debate. However, Paul Hilton\u2019s portrayal of Morgan Forster\u2019s quiet humanity is what sticks in the mind. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/29/the-inheritance-review-stephen-daldry\">Read the review</a></em>.</p> <h2>14</h2> <h2><strong>The Ferryman</strong> (2017)</h2> <p>Set on a 50-acre farm in County Armagh in 1981, Jez Butterworth\u2019s play had the richness and density of a good novel. It was partly about a reformed IRA gunman whose violent past is catching up with him, partly about the power of unspoken love and partly about the Hardy-esque rituals that give a rhythm to rural life. In an age of theatrical nouvelle cuisine, Butterworth\u2019s play felt like a five-course feast. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/03/the-ferryman-review-jez-butterworth-sam-mendes-paddy-considine-royal-court\">Read the review</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eb24fe503c8302706aee84f90f13ddad56f53fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eb24fe503c8302706aee84f90f13ddad56f53fe/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon McBurney in the Encounter at the Edinburgh festival in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside your head \u2026 Simon McBurney in the Encounter at the Edinburgh festival in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>13</h2> <h2><strong>The Encounter</strong> (2015)</h2> <p>It wasn\u2019t the first show to put the audience in headphones, but it was the first to make such extraordinary use of binaural sound. The Complicit\u00e9 production matched the hallucinatory nature of Petru Popescu\u2019s Amazon Beaming, a biography of the explorer Loren McIntyre, with a soundscape that got inside your head. Loops and vocal distortions turned an empty stage into a dense forest where Simon McBurney could ask questions about the ephemeral, the material and the telepathic. <strong>MF</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/09/the-encounter-edinburgh-festival-review-simon-mcburney\">Read the review</a></em>.</p> <h2>12</h2> <h2><strong>King Charles III</strong> (2014)</h2> <p>What would happen if the UK\u2019s future monarch refused to give royal assent to a bill he strongly opposed? Constitutional crisis, civil war and palace plotting, according to Mike Bartlett\u2019s fascinating blank-verse play. The Shakespearean echoes, which embraced Macbeth and Richard II, were made even more evident by Tim Pigott-Smith\u2019s deeply moving portrayal of the isolated and unloved insomniac king. <strong>MB </strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/11/king-charles-3-flawed-premise-royally-entertaining\">Read the review</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f5301c8f34869110a49866e6183988ab02ff40f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f5301c8f34869110a49866e6183988ab02ff40f/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Nwosu and Kevin Trainor in An Octoroon Photo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clever and dangerous \u2026 Ken Nwosu and Kevin Trainor in An Octoroon at the Orange Tree, London, in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Davenport/The Other Richard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>11</h2> <h2><strong>An Octoroon</strong> (2014)</h2> <p>This is a confounding comedy of race. Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s script eviscerates Dion Boucicault\u2019s The Octoroon, an 1859 melodrama about forbidden love on a slave plantation. Clever and dangerous, the play is designed to unsettle its audience \u2013 and it does. Using blackface, whiteface, redface and an anarchic humour, it blows up conventional notions of identity. It also blows up a steamship. Woven through the script is an anguished meditation on how a black artist should live and work in a white world. \u201cHi, everyone,\u201d a character known as BJJ says at the beginning. \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018black playwright\u2019.

This was her most expansive play to date, charting the parallels and differences between the world\u2019s two rival superpowers. In individualist US, we saw a photographer garlanded for his pursuit of an exiled Tiananmen Square demonstrator; in collectivist China, we watched a man punished for protesting about the smog-induced death of a neighbour. Today, as a trade war between the two nations accelerates, Kirkwood\u2019s play looks ever more pertinent. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/may/29/chimerica-review\">Read the review</a></em>.</p> <h2>9</h2> <h2><strong>Black Watch</strong> (2006)</h2> <p>Charged with bringing the National Theatre of Scotland into being, Vicky Featherstone reckoned there might be a story to tell about the Black Watch regiment before it was subsumed into the Royal Regiment of Scotland. She asked playwright Gregory Burke and director John Tiffany to devise a soldier\u2019s eye view of the battalion\u2019s history right up to the still topical war in Iraq.

Four elderly women sit in a sunlit garden dwelling on times past, at one point even breaking into a version of Da Doo Ron Ron. Meanwhile, one periodically cuts through the chat to offer a vision, in seven monologues, of a world of flood, fire, thirst and starvation. This was no routine road to dystopia, but a wryly compassionate play about life\u2019s soon-to-be-lost daily beauty. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/28/alone-together-review-caryl-churchill-royal-court-london\">Read the review</a></em>.</p> <h2>7</h2> <h2><strong>Matilda</strong> (2010)</h2> <p>Dennis Kelly and Tim Minchin\u2019s dizzily enjoyable musical about Roald Dahl\u2019s telekinetic bookworm sings the importance of two invaluable resources: public libraries and arts subsidy. Produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company, it became a global sensation thanks to its sweetly spiky songs, empowering celebration of the imagination and brilliantly rebellious heroine who puts the \u201crevolt\u201d into revolting rhymes. While her mum is at the bingo, Dahl\u2019s Matilda spends \u201ctwo glorious hours\u201d at the library.

Ultimately, however, the two men are divided by geography and the historic assumption that, in England, art is the property of the middle classes. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/jan/09/theatre.artsfeatures2\">Read the review</a></em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64126ad16434c9956c618bd65c632d067dc78d99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64126ad16434c9956c618bd65c632d067dc78d99/0_0_2254_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Mac\u2019s A 24-Decade History of Popular Music, performed at Melbourne festival in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Mac\u2019s A 24-Decade History of Popular Music, performed at Melbourne festival in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Walker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5</h2> <h2><strong>A 24-Decade History of Popular Music</strong> (2016)</h2> <p>Angry and ecstatic, this piece \u2013 first performed in eight three-hour chunks and finally assembled into one all-day, all-night, sleep-optional extravaganza \u2013 explores the fraught history of America, from the revolutionary war onwards, by revisiting the music these United States have loved. Taylor Mac, backed by a live band and joined by many guests, allots one hour for each decade, changing into new and increasingly jaw-dropping costumes (Machine Dazzle is the designer) as each segment concludes.

Not everyone, especially in New York, responded warmly to its more than three-hour running time. Others, though, were overwhelmed by Baker\u2019s portrait of three loners working in a rundown Massachusetts movie house. Apart from its touching evocation of frustrated desire, the play also offered a passionate defence of movies shot on 35mm film stock in a digitised age. <strong>MB </strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/20/the-flick-review-dorfman-national-theatre-london-annie-baker-cinema-play\">Read the review</a></em>.</p> <h2>3</h2> <h2><strong>The Children</strong> (2016)</h2> <p>Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s probing, thoughtful play showed three nuclear physicists reunited in the wake of a disaster at a local power station.

Like Falstaff, Johnny was both a charismatic storyteller and a disturber of the piece, and that ambivalence was the key to Butterworth\u2019s play. It lamented the loss of local customs but pinpointed the absurdity of seeking to preserve them in a modern, corporate age where even the morris dancers are brewery-sponsored. That double vision ran right through the play. We were spellbound by Johnny\u2019s outrageous stories of meeting a giant on the A14 or being kidnapped by traffic wardens in Marlborough. At the same time, we saw that the folkloric heroes he sought to emulate were a thing of the past in our modern, mechanised world. <strong>MB</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/16/jerusalem-review\">Read the review</a></em>.</p>",

Simon Stephens\u2019 detective yarn took audiences on a thrilling and disorientating trip across Europe, in a trilingual collaboration with German director Sebastian N\u00fcbling and Estonian designer Ene-Liis Semper. Loathed and loved in equal measure, it has undoubtedly galvanised a new generation of directors inspired by continental European theatre. And in its pre-Brexit deconstruction of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe, it feels chillingly prescient. CL Read the review. 49 Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven (2006) Wild, scorching and gleefully profane, Young Jean Lee\u2019s early play is an Asian-American identity-politics comedy. Lee, a Korean-American artist, populated the stage with three women in traditional Korean dress and a fourth woman, Korean-American, who despises them. (There\u2019s also a very boring white couple.) An exquisitely uncomfortable exploration of bias, it also includes mimed suicides choreographed to Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas. Lee continued to explore themes of prejudice and stereotype in works such as The Shipment and Straight White Men, but this finds her at her most scurrilous and original.

Mission Drift\u2019s heady mix of history, mythology and floor-shaking tunes skewered the American dream while recreating the giddy, greedy thrill it promises. In the age of Donald Trump, I\u2019ve yet to see another play that quite so incisively captures the myth of the United States and all the ugliness it has bred.

Even if it eventually flirts with melodrama, Elmina\u2019s Kitchen is a work of surging vitality that takes on board gun control, the battle between books and consumerism, and the maelstrom of life in a Hackney eatery.

Deprived of sight, you focus intensely on each stimulus. Then, vision restored, you see a face in front of you. A tear rolls down his cheek. Devastating.

Peter Morgan skilfully showed how David Frost\u2019s 1977 encounter with Richard Nixon was more than an on-camera combat between a talkshow host and a disgraced president. It implied that the two men, in vastly different ways, needed each other. Frost, having lost his American and Australian programmes, was seeking to restore his dwindling fortunes, while Nixon craved public expiation of his Watergate sins. Morgan also made one nostalgic for a time when current affairs TV had theatrical power.

Its ostensible subject was the way a group of Ashington miners, from 1934 to 1947, were turned into formidably skilful painters. Hall\u2019s play was fundamentally about the relationship between art and socialism and suggested that society had to be measured by its capacity for political change rather than by personal progress. MB Read the review. 43 The Lieutenant of Inishmore (2002) Initially seen as a slur against Irish patriotism, Martin McDonagh\u2019s black comedy has gained even more resonance with time. Mad Padraic, a gunman deemed too extreme for the IRA, returns to his native village to avenge himself on the killers of his beloved cat. While still hair-raising, the play now seems like a potent satire on terrorist violence. MB Read the review. 42 Topdog/Underdog (2002) A tidy two-hander that somehow encompasses much of US history in its brief scenes, Suzan-Lori Parks\u2019 lively and cerebral comedy centres on two brothers, one named Lincoln and the other Booth, locked in love and deadly rivalry. No prizes for guessing how this one ends. Lincoln works at a shooting gallery, dressing up, in whiteface and stovepipe, as the president he is named for. Booth hopes to master three-card monte, a sidewalk con game. Topdog/Underdog enjoy its pretences and con games, but it is Parks\u2019 language \u2013 vibrant, poetic, jazz-inflected \u2013 that makes this play the real deal. AS Read the review. 41 One Man, Two Guvnors (2011) Goldoni\u2019s 18th century comedy, Il Servitore di Due Padroni, has had many makeovers but few funnier than this one by Richard Bean. The action was shifted from Venice to 1960s Brighton, the hero became a failed skiffle player and the masterstroke was the addition to the dinner-serving scene of an octogenarian waiter with a tremulous hand and a remarkable capacity to rebound after falling backwards down the stairs. MB Read the review. 40 Caroline, or Change (2003) With a score by Jeanine Tesori and book and lyrics by Tony Kushner, this was a genuine musical game-changer. Dealing with the relationship between an African-American housemaid and her Jewish employers, it exposed the racial, social and economic tensions in 1960s America and the vivacious score even animated washing machines and hairdryers. MB Read the review. 39 First Night (2001) An act of theatrical bad faith, this brilliant and subversive piece by the devised theatre company Forced Entertainment shreds the social contract between performers and audience. Structured as a smarmy seaside variety entertainment, the show begins badly and gets much worse. There\u2019s a balloon-clad ecdysiast who runs off in tears, a doll who tortures his ventriloquist, a mentalist who predicts the death of most everyone watching. The performers\u2019 smiles contort into a rictus; the sequins sparkle menacingly. Cruel, unsettling and often very funny, it attacks its spectators directly, upheaving dramatic expectations and disrupting audience complacency. AS Read the review. 38 An Oak Tree (2005) The concept behind Tim Crouch\u2019s An Oak Tree is simple but brilliant: each night, a new, unrehearsed actor performs the show alongside Crouch, thus exposing the transformation that lies at the heart of all theatre. While it might sound like a cold intellectual exercise, the use of an unprepared and often slightly baffled performer poignantly speaks to the show\u2019s themes of loss and grief, making it one of the century\u2019s best marriages of form and content. CL Read the review. 37 random (2008) In random, debbie tucker green reinvigorated the monologue form, testing how many voices can be channelled through one performer. Each of the characters in this story of a family shattered by a random act of violence has a distinct way of speaking, yet they all cohere in one female figure who holds together their collective grief. Sadly, with violent crime on the rise, the play is as powerful and relevant as ever. CL Read the review. 36 God of Carnage (2006) In Yasmina Reza\u2019s play, two ostensibly civilised couples meet to sort out a playground punch-up by their respective offspring. Its beauty is that the pales and forts of reason quickly break down and bourgeois hypocrisy is exposed. Underrated because of her commercial success (Art, Life x 3), Reza is a razor-sharp analyst of middle-class manners whose work reveals a satirist\u2019s savage indignation. MB Read the review. 35 Sing Yer Heart Out for the Lads (2002) Roy Williams\u2019 play still offers one of the most vivid accounts of the variety and depth of Anglicised racism. That racism may take the form of reflex bigotry, skin-deep liberalism or, since the play is set in a pub on the day England are playing Germany in a World Cup qualifier, barbaric tribalism. Football, for Williams, becomes a way of exposing the ugly face of the nation. MB Read the review. 34 Ruined (2008) Loosely based on Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Mother Courage and Her Children, Lynn Nottage\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning play unfurls at Mama Nadi\u2019s, a brothel and bar in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Here Mama Nadi and her \u201cgirls\u201d, each an orphan of war, entertain soldiers on both sides, flirting for their lives. Never indulgent or exploitative, this shattering play explores how women assert themselves in a world ruled by men who use rape and mutilation as weapons. Nottage\u2019s play never sanitises this violence, but it argues, via beautifully complicated characters, that survival, compassion and even love remain possible. AS Read the review. 33 Mr Burns (2012) Much was made of Anne Washburn\u2019s decision to imagine The Simpsons surviving the collapse of human civilisation, but really Mr Burns is about how cultures evolve and reinvent. Almost regardless of whether it\u2019s Homer Simpson or the Homer of The Iliad who manages to escape apocalypse, the play wittily explores how these stories morph, mutate and lend meaning to human lives. And it\u2019s theatrically audacious, concluding with an elaborate pop-culture opera. CL Read the review. 32 Fun Home (2013) This sweet and bitter musical, based on Alison Bechdel\u2019s graphic novel memoir, tells twinned stories, one comic, one tragic. Alison \u2013 seen at three ages: Small, Medium and Big \u2013 describes her sexual awakening while trying to understand why her gay father, an English teacher and a funeral director, committed suicide. Jeanine Tesori\u2019s delectable melodies and Lisa Kron\u2019s lyrics, just on the elegant side of conversational, give the show a remarkable intimacy. The piece thrums with empathy for all its characters and the songs in which Alison discovers her lesbianism, the poignant Ring of Keys and the giddy Changing My Major, are pure joy. AS Read the review. 31 Red Velvet (2012) Theatre history is a rich subject. Lolita Chakrabarti seized on the stunning story of the passions aroused by the London debut in 1833 of the African-American actor Ira Aldridge as Othello. His presence provoked professional bitchery, press venom and popular prejudice. But this was also a play about the nature of performance and a reminder that Aldridge was resented because, like all great actors, he was seen as a pioneering realist. MB Read the review. 30 The History Boys (2004) Can one still champion a play whose main character, Hector, likes copping a feel of boys\u2019 balls? Absolutely, because Alan Bennett\u2019s point is that an inspirational teacher may also be morally imperfect. But that is only one aspect of a richly diverse comedy that deals with the covert eroticism of the teacher-pupil relationship, the overt elitism of the educational system and the debasement of culture by flashy presentation. MB Read the review. 29 The James Plays (2014) Rona Munro\u2019s seven-and-a-half hour trilogy covered Scotland\u2019s history from 1421-88. The overwhelming impression was of a kingdom beset by feudal infighting and of the inescapable solitude of monarchy. Presented by the national theatres of Scotland and Great Britain, Munro\u2019s timely trilogy also raised serious questions about the huge potential and possible hazards of independence. MB Read the review. 28 Iphigenia in Splott (2015) Inspired by Euripides\u2019s tragedy Iphigenia in Aulis, Gary Owen delivered a blistering dispatch from modern-day Cardiff, capturing just one of the many British communities on the brink, ripped by divisions and badly wounded by austerity. In the sacrificial Effie, who lives at a million miles an hour and gives the audience the finger, but hides a heart-bursting benevolence, he created one of the most enduring heroines of the century so far. Owen\u2019s monologue starts with the rush of a boozy night out then stings with a hangover from hell. CW Read the review. 27 Cyprus Avenue (2016) David Ireland\u2019s blackly comic play showed how a Protestant loyalist\u2019s devotion to the unionist cause led him to murderously lunatic extremes. The play was almost a mirror image of McDonagh\u2019s The Lieutenant of Inishmore in that it exposed the destructive absurdity of sectarian hatred. It also yielded a truly great performance by Stephen Rea, who unforgettably captured the melancholia behind the hero\u2019s mania. MB Read the review. 26 The Masque of the Red Death (2007) Punchdrunk\u2019s beguiling show, based on several short stories of Edgar Allen Poe, occupied the Victorian-era Battersea Arts Centre. Sexy, scary, often hallucinatory and wholly immersive, it left masked ticket holders free to wander its atmospheric, lavishly decorated rooms or to chase after incestuous siblings and black cats (sometimes those characters chased back) before gathering everyone together for an orgiastic masquerade. At times, upon discovering a secret passage tucked inside a wardrobe, say, or suddenly hearing music issuing from a hidden music hall, The Masque of the Red Death could conjure the feeling of walking through one\u2019s own dreams. AS Read the review. 25 Brand New Ancients (2012) Kate Tempest has mastered and blurred an impressive range of forms: written poetry, spoken word, theatre, hip-hop and fiction. Brand New Ancients thrillingly mashed together poetry, drama and music, bringing an epic spirit to stories about ordinary people. The show throbbed with energy and compassion, placing audiences firmly in the shoes of its characters. Bold, lyrical and compelling, Brand New Ancients showcased a virtuosic storyteller at her best. CL Read the review. 24 London Road (2011) This pioneering verbatim musical showed how an Ipswich community reconstituted itself after the gruesome murder of five sex workers on a single street. Adam Cork\u2019s score, deploying the everyday phrases of London Road residents collated by Alecky Blythe, acquired a fugal delicacy and opened up new possibilities for musical theatre: the savour of actuality, one felt, might one day supplant the narcissism of showbiz. MB Read the review. 23 The Height of the Storm (2018) Florian Zeller\u2019s plays, translated by Christopher Hampton, have captivated British audiences through their cryptic portrayals of personal crisis. This was his best yet because it explored love, loss, dementia and the difficulty of coming to terms with the death of a lifelong partner. As played by Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins, it moved one to tears but also left one pleasantly perplexed about its ultimate meaning. MB Read the review. 22 The Watsons (2018) The heart often shrinks at the prospect of yet another adaptation of a novel, but Laura Wade\u2019s take on a piece of unfinished Jane Austen juvenilia shone like a gem. Having summarised Austen\u2019s plot in under a half-hour, Wade brilliantly turned the play into an argument between herself and the characters about their destiny. Like a heady mix of Luigi Pirandello and Tom Stoppard, the play opened up fascinating questions about the capacity of fictional figures to escape their author\u2019s control. MB Read the review. 21 Blackbird (2005) David Harrower\u2019s disturbing play offers a riveting study of sexual obsession. It deals with a fraught confrontation between a 28-year-old woman and a 56-year-old man who, 15 years earlier, had enjoyed a criminally transgressive relationship. Harrower suspends moral judgment to question our knee-jerk assumptions about the nature of adult guilt and adolescent innocence. MB Read the review. 20 Barber Shop Chronicles (2017) Switching between six establishments in two continents on a single day, Inua Ellams\u2019s invigorating play showed how, for African men, barber shops are both pub and political platform. Soccer, social issues and the difficulties of father-son relationships were recurring themes. But the abiding image of Bijan Sheibani\u2019s production, which incorporated uplifting music and dance, was of the barber shop as a place where you shed your locks but discover your identity. MB Read the review. 19 Our Lady of Kibeho (2014) Katori Hall (The Mountaintop) turns the story of the Marian apparitions that visited a trio of Rwandan schoolgirls in 1981 into a religious and political drama with echoes of George Bernard Shaw\u2019s Saint Joan and Arthur Miller\u2019s The Crucible. Hall\u2019s great achievement is that, without necessarily validating the visions, she shows how they reflected the country\u2019s existing Tutsi-Hutu tensions and foresaw the horrific genocide to come. MB Read the review. 18 Enron (2009) Lucy Prebble\u2019s was the first in a number of plays skewering corporate corruption following the financial crash. Dealing with the rise and fall of an overextended Texan energy company that started trading in the internet and even the weather, Prebble\u2019s play was an exhilarating mix of political satire, modern morality and \u2013 in Rupert Goold\u2019s production \u2013 Citizen Kane-like spectacle. MB Read the review. 17 Nine Night (2018) Playwriting debuts don\u2019t come much better than this. Natasha Gordon took a theme explored by many other writers: what it means to lead a bicultural existence in which you are caught between immigrant tradition and the insistent present. Gordon gave it fizz and bounce by showing a London family\u2019s divided reaction to the Jamaican custom of a nine-night funeral wake. Nothing was more touching than the sight of the family\u2019s graduate daughter suspending her natural scepticism to acknowledge the power of her spiritual inheritance. MB Read the review. 16 Blue/Orange (2000) Joe Penhall\u2019s compassion for those marginalised by society was seen at its best in this extraordinary play. It showed a young black man, who believed oranges are blue and Idi Amin was his father, being used as a ping-pong ball by two warring, white medical practitioners. Penhall nailed several issues: the myth of a tolerant community ready to receive people with a personality disorder, the high incidence of mental illness among members of the African-Caribbean population and the idea that all professions are a conspiracy against the laity. MB Read the review. 15 The Inheritance (2018) Modern drama seems to oscillate between the minimal and the maximal. Matthew Lopez\u2019s two-part, seven-hour play was emphatically in the latter camp. Dealing with the bitter inheritance of Aids and the spiritual qualities of a house, it was like a cross between Angels in America and Howards End. It teemed with narrative incident and impassioned debate. However, Paul Hilton\u2019s portrayal of Morgan Forster\u2019s quiet humanity is what sticks in the mind. MB Read the review. 14 The Ferryman (2017) Set on a 50-acre farm in County Armagh in 1981, Jez Butterworth\u2019s play had the richness and density of a good novel. It was partly about a reformed IRA gunman whose violent past is catching up with him, partly about the power of unspoken love and partly about the Hardy-esque rituals that give a rhythm to rural life. In an age of theatrical nouvelle cuisine, Butterworth\u2019s play felt like a five-course feast. MB Read the review. 13 The Encounter (2015) It wasn\u2019t the first show to put the audience in headphones, but it was the first to make such extraordinary use of binaural sound. The Complicit\u00e9 production matched the hallucinatory nature of Petru Popescu\u2019s Amazon Beaming, a biography of the explorer Loren McIntyre, with a soundscape that got inside your head. Loops and vocal distortions turned an empty stage into a dense forest where Simon McBurney could ask questions about the ephemeral, the material and the telepathic. MF Read the review. 12 King Charles III (2014) What would happen if the UK\u2019s future monarch refused to give royal assent to a bill he strongly opposed? Constitutional crisis, civil war and palace plotting, according to Mike Bartlett\u2019s fascinating blank-verse play. The Shakespearean echoes, which embraced Macbeth and Richard II, were made even more evident by Tim Pigott-Smith\u2019s deeply moving portrayal of the isolated and unloved insomniac king. MB Read the review. 11 An Octoroon (2014) This is a confounding comedy of race. Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s script eviscerates Dion Boucicault\u2019s The Octoroon, an 1859 melodrama about forbidden love on a slave plantation. Clever and dangerous, the play is designed to unsettle its audience \u2013 and it does. Using blackface, whiteface, redface and an anarchic humour, it blows up conventional notions of identity. It also blows up a steamship. Woven through the script is an anguished meditation on how a black artist should live and work in a white world. \u201cHi, everyone,\u201d a character known as BJJ says at the beginning. \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018black playwright\u2019. I don\u2019t know exactly what that means.\u201d AS Read the review. 10 Chimerica (2013) Lucy Kirkwood can do both intimate and epic. This was her most expansive play to date, charting the parallels and differences between the world\u2019s two rival superpowers. In individualist US, we saw a photographer garlanded for his pursuit of an exiled Tiananmen Square demonstrator; in collectivist China, we watched a man punished for protesting about the smog-induced death of a neighbour. Today, as a trade war between the two nations accelerates, Kirkwood\u2019s play looks ever more pertinent. MB Read the review. 9 Black Watch (2006) Charged with bringing the National Theatre of Scotland into being, Vicky Featherstone reckoned there might be a story to tell about the Black Watch regiment before it was subsumed into the Royal Regiment of Scotland. She asked playwright Gregory Burke and director John Tiffany to devise a soldier\u2019s eye view of the battalion\u2019s history right up to the still topical war in Iraq. Epic, hard-bitten and tender, this landmark production put the NTS on the map. MF Read the review. 8 Escaped Alone (2016) Caryl Churchill\u2019s play hinged on a powerful juxtaposition. Four elderly women sit in a sunlit garden dwelling on times past, at one point even breaking into a version of Da Doo Ron Ron. Meanwhile, one periodically cuts through the chat to offer a vision, in seven monologues, of a world of flood, fire, thirst and starvation. This was no routine road to dystopia, but a wryly compassionate play about life\u2019s soon-to-be-lost daily beauty. MB Read the review. 7 Matilda (2010) Dennis Kelly and Tim Minchin\u2019s dizzily enjoyable musical about Roald Dahl\u2019s telekinetic bookworm sings the importance of two invaluable resources: public libraries and arts subsidy. Produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company, it became a global sensation thanks to its sweetly spiky songs, empowering celebration of the imagination and brilliantly rebellious heroine who puts the \u201crevolt\u201d into revolting rhymes. While her mum is at the bingo, Dahl\u2019s Matilda spends \u201ctwo glorious hours\u201d at the library. This gives the same pleasure in the theatre. CW Read the review. 6 The York Realist (2001) Class and sex intertwine beautifully in Peter Gill\u2019s play, reminding us that, as a director, he rediscovered the forgotten dramas of DH Lawrence. Gill shows a Yorkshire farm-worker enjoying an affair with a London-based theatre man working on the medieval mystery plays. Ultimately, however, the two men are divided by geography and the historic assumption that, in England, art is the property of the middle classes. MB Read the review. 5 A 24-Decade History of Popular Music (2016) Angry and ecstatic, this piece \u2013 first performed in eight three-hour chunks and finally assembled into one all-day, all-night, sleep-optional extravaganza \u2013 explores the fraught history of America, from the revolutionary war onwards, by revisiting the music these United States have loved. Taylor Mac, backed by a live band and joined by many guests, allots one hour for each decade, changing into new and increasingly jaw-dropping costumes (Machine Dazzle is the designer) as each segment concludes. A thrilling playwright and performer who identifies as queer and prefers the pronoun judy, Mac is no patriot, but the show\u2019s scepticism is interleaved with joy. AS Read the review. 4 The Flick (2013) If drama is a study in human desperation, then Annie Baker\u2019s play was intensely dramatic. Not everyone, especially in New York, responded warmly to its more than three-hour running time. Others, though, were overwhelmed by Baker\u2019s portrait of three loners working in a rundown Massachusetts movie house. Apart from its touching evocation of frustrated desire, the play also offered a passionate defence of movies shot on 35mm film stock in a digitised age. MB Read the review. 3 The Children (2016) Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s probing, thoughtful play showed three nuclear physicists reunited in the wake of a disaster at a local power station. This opened up huge questions about the poisoned legacy we are handing on to future generations and about whether having children heightens or diminishes one\u2019s sense of responsibility. It was an impressive, slow-burning work that confirmed Kirkwood\u2019s status in the front rank of British dramatists. MB Read the review. 2 Hamilton (2015) Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s hip-hop musical about the birth of a nation and the rise to power of \u201ca bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman\u201d was hyped to the skies. It justified the drum-beating through its pulsating energy, dexterous lyrics and celebration of America\u2019s overwhelming debt to immigrants. Only time will tell if it has a major impact on the musical form but, in performance, it proved an exhilarating rollercoaster of a show. MB Read the review. 1 Jerusalem (2009) Jez Butterworth\u2019s mesmerising study of a changing England was built around the figure of Johnny \u201cRooster\u201d Byron, a Wiltshire Falstaff unforgettably played by Mark Rylance. Like Falstaff, Johnny was both a charismatic storyteller and a disturber of the piece, and that ambivalence was the key to Butterworth\u2019s play. It lamented the loss of local customs but pinpointed the absurdity of seeking to preserve them in a modern, corporate age where even the morris dancers are brewery-sponsored. That double vision ran right through the play. We were spellbound by Johnny\u2019s outrageous stories of meeting a giant on the A14 or being kidnapped by traffic wardens in Marlborough. At the same time, we saw that the folkloric heroes he sought to emulate were a thing of the past in our modern, mechanised world. MB Read the review.",

That seems only fair: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/16/jerusalem-review\">Jerusalem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/03/the-ferryman-review-jez-butterworth-sam-mendes-paddy-considine-royal-court\">The Ferryman</a>, which have packed out theatres in London and New York and scooped up countless awards, are, by any standard, big plays. Pinning down the 50-year-old Butterworth is difficult. He moves easily between theatre and cinema. His plays switch between the intimate and the epic. They have no single overarching theme. Yet Butterworth\u2019s work can be defined in several ways: by its fascination with national identity and personal betrayal, its three-dimensional characterisation, its richly textured language.</p> <p>Much of that was evident in Butterworth\u2019s first big success, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/nov/04/jez-butterworth-mojo-jerusalem\">Mojo</a>, which burst on the scene like a fireball in 1995. At first, most of us were hypnotised by the virtuosic patter. The setting is a tacky club in 1950s Soho and one of the minor mobsters goes into a sustained riff about a gangland boss\u2019s awesome shoes, which he describes as \u201cbaby fuckin\u2019 buckskin hand-stitched by elves\u201d. Instantly one knew one was in the presence of a real writer. But beneath the coruscating language and the dark comedy lay a play about a patriarchal world in which damaged men talked big to conceal their loneliness, panic and fear of emotional contact.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e05e2efc4b78892a135cec106cb7a84004dcad1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e05e2efc4b78892a135cec106cb7a84004dcad1f/0_0_4100_2692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rituals \u2026 Mark Rylance as Rooster with Charlotte Mills and Jessica Barden in Jerusalem at the Apollo, London, in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mercurial \u2026 Mark Rylance as Rooster with Charlotte Mills and Jessica Barden in Jerusalem at the Apollo, London, in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Butterworth kept us waiting impatiently for his next two plays \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/apr/19/theatre.artsfeatures\">The Night Heron</a> (2002) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/mar/10/theatre\">Winterling</a> (2006) \u2013 but they left many bothered and bewildered rather than bewitched. Both had a rural setting \u2013 the Fens and Dartmoor, respectively \u2013 and both confirmed Butterworth had a gift for cracking dialogue. But what were they about? The former, dealing with two sacked Cambridge college gardeners, appeared to be about victimisation of the outsider. The latter, involving a power-battle between a gangland fugitive and his former partner, was too close to Pinter for comfort. But Butterworth\u2019s most passionate advocate, the Royal Court\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ian-rickson\">Ian Rickson</a>, stuck loyally with him. Tucked inside my copy of The Night Heron I found a letter from Rickson arguing that \u201cit was the first truly metaphysical play I have read for a long time\u201d and that it explored the soul, the spirit and what it meant to be human.</p> <p>If the jury was still out on Butterworth\u2019s true weight as a writer, it received a decisive answer in 2009.

      "bodyText": "Jez Butterworth is one of only two writers \u2013 the other is Lucy Kirkwood \u2013 to have a double entry in our list of the century\u2019s best plays. That seems only fair: Jerusalem and The Ferryman, which have packed out theatres in London and New York and scooped up countless awards, are, by any standard, big plays. Pinning down the 50-year-old Butterworth is difficult. He moves easily between theatre and cinema. His plays switch between the intimate and the epic. They have no single overarching theme. Yet Butterworth\u2019s work can be defined in several ways: by its fascination with national identity and personal betrayal, its three-dimensional characterisation, its richly textured language. Much of that was evident in Butterworth\u2019s first big success, Mojo, which burst on the scene like a fireball in 1995. At first, most of us were hypnotised by the virtuosic patter. The setting is a tacky club in 1950s Soho and one of the minor mobsters goes into a sustained riff about a gangland boss\u2019s awesome shoes, which he describes as \u201cbaby fuckin\u2019 buckskin hand-stitched by elves\u201d. Instantly one knew one was in the presence of a real writer. But beneath the coruscating language and the dark comedy lay a play about a patriarchal world in which damaged men talked big to conceal their loneliness, panic and fear of emotional contact. Butterworth kept us waiting impatiently for his next two plays \u2013 The Night Heron (2002) and Winterling (2006) \u2013 but they left many bothered and bewildered rather than bewitched. Both had a rural setting \u2013 the Fens and Dartmoor, respectively \u2013 and both confirmed Butterworth had a gift for cracking dialogue. But what were they about? The former, dealing with two sacked Cambridge college gardeners, appeared to be about victimisation of the outsider. The latter, involving a power-battle between a gangland fugitive and his former partner, was too close to Pinter for comfort. But Butterworth\u2019s most passionate advocate, the Royal Court\u2019s Ian Rickson, stuck loyally with him. Tucked inside my copy of The Night Heron I found a letter from Rickson arguing that \u201cit was the first truly metaphysical play I have read for a long time\u201d and that it explored the soul, the spirit and what it meant to be human. If the jury was still out on Butterworth\u2019s true weight as a writer, it received a decisive answer in 2009. First in March came a fine play, Parlour Song, at the Almeida. Set on a new housing estate on London\u2019s outer fringe \u2013 maybe a nod to Butterworth\u2019s own childhood upbringing in St Albans \u2013 it offered a vivid portrait of the lust, longing and treachery that stalk many a comforting suburban prison. In May came an even bigger shock when Jerusalem opened at the Royal Court and, although it called forth superlatives, I\u2019m not sure that even now we have fully grasped its significance. Like many people, I initially assumed it was a hymn to a lost England and to the disappearance of a pagan, primitive culture. But the more I see and read it, the more I become convinced that its hero is a sad anachronism as well as a mercurial tale-spinner and that Butterworth is writing about a country torn between a romanticised nostalgia for its past and a deep uncertainty about its future: at the April 23rd Fair these Wiltshire villagers are recreating George and the Dragon rituals while also paying tribute to Hollywood movies such as Men in Black II. I hate to invoke the B-word but, long before Brexit became part of our vocabulary, Butterworth was writing about a country \u2013 and it is specifically England \u2013 hankering after national myths that turn out to be entirely fabricated. After the cryptic, little-seen The River (2012), Butterworth hit the bullseye again with The Ferryman (2017). And once more Butterworth is asking searching questions about personal and national identity such as \u201cWho are we?\u201d and \u201cWhere do our ultimate loyalties lie?\u201d Although Butterworth was attacked in some quarters for deploying theatrical stereotypes of Irishness, to most spectators the story rang thrillingly true.

      "body": "<p>Bacharuddin Jusuf (BJ) Habibie, who has died aged 83, became president of Indonesia by default in 1998 when his patron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/27/obituaries.johngittings\" title=\"\">Suharto</a> could no longer cling on after three decades of dictatorial rule. Though Habibie\u2019s tenure was a mere 512 days, he oversaw a successful if turbulent transition to some form of democracy \u2013 though to what extent he actively sought out that goal or was obliged to pursue it through his own weakness and the growing strength of popular protest remains in question.</p> <p>When he came to power Habibie pledged to lift restrictions on political parties, to recognise \u201cdemocratic aspirations\u201d and to tackle the \u201ccorruption, collusion and nepotism\u201d of the past. On National Day, 17 August 1998, he also apologised for widespread human rights violations under the Suharto regime, admitting that these had been committed by \u201cindividuals from the state apparatus\u201d.</p> <p>Yet he could not fully discard Suharto\u2019s mantle: on the previous day he had presented the nation\u2019s highest award to the dictator\u2019s wife, Raden Ayu Siti Hartinah, and youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy Suharto), who were both tainted by corruption.</p> <p>One of Habibie\u2019s most important legacies was his intervention on East Timor (now Timor-Leste), the former Portuguese colony that had been illegally occupied by Indonesia under Suharto in 1975. Habibie initially offered East Timor the special status of \u201cextensive autonomy\u201d, then went further by granting its inhabitants a referendum on self-determination.</p> <p>Their resounding vote for independence led to brutal suppression by pro-Indonesian militias, and though Habibie wavered during that crisis, he eventually consented to the intervention of a UN peacekeeping force, paving the way for East Timor\u2019s independence.</p> <p>\u201cToo many people have lost their lives since the beginning of the unrest, lost their homes and security,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop the suffering and mourning immediately.\u201d His stance on East Timor was put into effect by the release from jail of the resistance leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/13/video-shows-tender-goodbye-between-dying-indonesian-pm-and-timor-leste-leader\" title=\"\">Xanana Gusm\u00e3o</a>, who became East Timor\u2019s first president, and who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/13/video-shows-tender-goodbye-between-dying-indonesian-pm-and-timor-leste-leader\" title=\"\">bid a tearful farewell</a> to Habibie on his death bed.</p> <p>Indonesian public opinion, however, was not on the side of Timorese independence, and his moves in that direction did not enhance his popularity. A larger domestic grudge against Habibie came from his inability to deal with an inherited economic crisis that led food prices to soar and pushed millions into precarious informal employment. Habibie\u2019s failure to tackle corruption also played a large part in his gradual loss of public and parliamentary support. Several of his associates and leading members of the ruling <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Golkar\" title=\"\">Golkar party</a> were implicated in the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/567571.stm\" title=\"\">Bank Bali</a> scandal, in which large sums of money disappeared. There was more opposition when his attorney general announced that corruption charges against Suharto would be dropped for \u201clack of evidence\u201d.</p> <p>In the run-up to the 1999 presidential elections, a poll in the national Tempo magazine showed that only 7% would vote for Habibie. When Golkar voted him down a month before the elections he had no alternative but to withdraw. His presidential term had not lasted long, but nonetheless he had stayed in office for a greater period of time than many had expected. In his memoirs he observed that \u201cthe slightly more optimistic predicted that I would not last more than 100 days\u201d.</p> <p>Habibie was born in Parepare in the state of South Sulawesi, the fourth of eight children.

      "bodyText": "Bacharuddin Jusuf (BJ) Habibie, who has died aged 83, became president of Indonesia by default in 1998 when his patron Suharto could no longer cling on after three decades of dictatorial rule. Though Habibie\u2019s tenure was a mere 512 days, he oversaw a successful if turbulent transition to some form of democracy \u2013 though to what extent he actively sought out that goal or was obliged to pursue it through his own weakness and the growing strength of popular protest remains in question. When he came to power Habibie pledged to lift restrictions on political parties, to recognise \u201cdemocratic aspirations\u201d and to tackle the \u201ccorruption, collusion and nepotism\u201d of the past. On National Day, 17 August 1998, he also apologised for widespread human rights violations under the Suharto regime, admitting that these had been committed by \u201cindividuals from the state apparatus\u201d. Yet he could not fully discard Suharto\u2019s mantle: on the previous day he had presented the nation\u2019s highest award to the dictator\u2019s wife, Raden Ayu Siti Hartinah, and youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy Suharto), who were both tainted by corruption. One of Habibie\u2019s most important legacies was his intervention on East Timor (now Timor-Leste), the former Portuguese colony that had been illegally occupied by Indonesia under Suharto in 1975. Habibie initially offered East Timor the special status of \u201cextensive autonomy\u201d, then went further by granting its inhabitants a referendum on self-determination. Their resounding vote for independence led to brutal suppression by pro-Indonesian militias, and though Habibie wavered during that crisis, he eventually consented to the intervention of a UN peacekeeping force, paving the way for East Timor\u2019s independence. \u201cToo many people have lost their lives since the beginning of the unrest, lost their homes and security,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop the suffering and mourning immediately.\u201d His stance on East Timor was put into effect by the release from jail of the resistance leader Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, who became East Timor\u2019s first president, and who bid a tearful farewell to Habibie on his death bed. Indonesian public opinion, however, was not on the side of Timorese independence, and his moves in that direction did not enhance his popularity. A larger domestic grudge against Habibie came from his inability to deal with an inherited economic crisis that led food prices to soar and pushed millions into precarious informal employment. Habibie\u2019s failure to tackle corruption also played a large part in his gradual loss of public and parliamentary support. Several of his associates and leading members of the ruling Golkar party were implicated in the Bank Bali scandal, in which large sums of money disappeared. There was more opposition when his attorney general announced that corruption charges against Suharto would be dropped for \u201clack of evidence\u201d. In the run-up to the 1999 presidential elections, a poll in the national Tempo magazine showed that only 7% would vote for Habibie. When Golkar voted him down a month before the elections he had no alternative but to withdraw. His presidential term had not lasted long, but nonetheless he had stayed in office for a greater period of time than many had expected. In his memoirs he observed that \u201cthe slightly more optimistic predicted that I would not last more than 100 days\u201d. Habibie was born in Parepare in the state of South Sulawesi, the fourth of eight children. His father, Alwi Abdul Jalil Habibie, a government official of Sulawesi descent who promoted clove cultivation, died when he was only 12, and his mother, Tuti Marini Puspowardojo, was a Javanese noblewoman from the ancient sultanate of Yogyakarta. A model plane enthusiast at a young age, Habibie graduated from the Bandung Institute of Technology and continued his studies in Germany. After a doctorate from the Aachen Institute of Technology he joined the aircraft-maker Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm, rising quickly up the management ladder to become vice-president and director of applied technology. In 1974 he was persuaded to return to Indonesia by Suharto, who had seized power in 1967 from the founding president Sukarno after fanning the flames of an anti-left pogrom in 1965-66 in which at least half a million were killed. Suharto appointed Habibie minister of research and technology, in which role he promoted, not always effectively, investment in a large number of state-owned industries designated as \u201cstrategic\u201d, including steel, arms, energy and aircraft manufacture. He deferred to Suharto\u2019s rapacious family, and flattered the dictator by calling him \u201cSGS\u201d \u2013 short for Super Genius Suharto. Early in 1998 Suharto, though faced with economic collapse , sought re-election for a seventh term, and appointed Habibie unexpectedly as his vice-presidential running mate. Suharto\u2019s purpose in doing so became clear when, after victory but with continuing demonstrations against his presidency and a fall-off in support from politicians around him, he resigned shortly after the election, leaving Habibie to succeed him. It may have been a gesture of contempt as much as of confidence: Suharto was one of those who did not expect him to last long. In retirement Habibie spent much of his time in Germany and wrote a memoir, Decisive Moments (2006), justifying his tenure as president. The Habibie family also invested heavily in Batam Island, across the water from Singapore and a popular tourist destination. Habibie\u2019s wife, Hasri Ainun (nee Besari), had known him since they were schoolmates. After her death in 2010, Habibie wrote a fond memoir of their life together, Habibie and Ainun, which was turned into a successful film of the same name, released in 2012. In one popular scene Ainun, a doctor, reproaches him for not taking care of his health: \u201cIf you don\u2019t look after your body properly, how are you supposed to look after 200 million people?\u201d she asks. Habibie did look after the people far better than had his malign patron and predecessor, but with the army still powerful behind the scenes Indonesia\u2019s democratic transition remains incomplete to this day. He is survived by his two sons, Ilham Akbar and Thareq Kemal. \u2022 Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, politician, born 25 June 1936; died 11 September 2019",

      "bodyText": "Regardless of the recent endless political convulsions and intrigue, one thing is certain: party conference season is going ahead as usual. Whether that\u2019s a cause for celebration among the MPs and journalists schlepping to events in Bournemouth, Brighton, Manchester, Newport and Aberdeen in quick succession remains to be seen. For the ordinary members of the parties concerned, however, conferences matter. They afford an opportunity not just to let your hair down for a few days, but also to renew your faith and commitment to the cause. You get the chance, too, to talk at fringe events with politicians you might otherwise only get to see on the telly. And, unless you\u2019re a Tory and therefore have no say in such matters, you even get to decide on policies that, theoretically anyway, might make it into your party\u2019s manifesto. But there\u2019s a problem here too. The \u201cordinary members\u201d of the UK\u2019s political parties aren\u2019t really that ordinary. In fact, party members are, at least in the strictest sense of the word, positively abnormal. True, getting on for 1 million Britons belong to a political party \u2013 but that leaves tens of millions who don\u2019t, and who would probably never dream of joining one either. That doesn\u2019t, of course, mean that grassroots members are all as weird and way out as some of their media stereotypes suggest. Not every grassroots Conservative is a blue-rinsed dragon or a Colonel Blimp \u2013 or, for that matter, an oleaginous \u201cTory boy\u201d (or girl). Likewise, not every Labour member is a middle-class, Corbyn-supporting \u201cTrot\u201d or a salt-of-the-earth trade unionist.

The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n    <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit negotiators have so far only presented the EU with a draft of the withdrawal agreement with the backstop scrubbed out, UK government sources have confirmed. In a move that has caused tensions with EU leaders, Johnson\u2019s team are refusing to put forward a written proposal to Brussels at this stage for fear it will be rejected out of hand or publicly rubbished. Instead, they want to wait until almost the last minute before the October summit before presenting a plan to the EU, with just two weeks before the UK is due to leave the bloc. The UK government source said the two sides had debated alternatives to the backstop in written discussion documents \u2013 such as an all-Ireland regulatory zone and customs checks away from the border \u2013 but they would not be putting forward a legal text to the EU at this stage. There have been reports that David Frost, the UK\u2019s lead negotiator, is keeping a plan locked safe in his briefcase but the wording has not been shared with Brussels. Frustration with the UK\u2019s approach broke into the open on Monday as Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, gave a press conference next to an empty podium following a meeting with Johnson, who refused to take part because of loud protests nearby. Bettel said the UK government needed to put on paper an alternative to the Irish backstop, and appeared to suggest that party political considerations might be standing in the way. \u201cI told him: \u2018I hear a lot but I don\u2019t read a lot.\u2019 If they want to discuss anything we need to have it written [down] \u2026 Don\u2019t put the blame on us because they don\u2019t know how to get out of the situation they put themselves in,\u201d Bettel said. As the chaotic scenes were played out, the European commission issued a statement disclosing that its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, had told the prime minister it was his responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions and that \u201csuch proposals have not yet been made\u201d. Johnson has brushed off the Luxembourg incident with a claim that he is still working towards a deal and believes EU leaders will want to strike an agreement because they have had a \u201cbellyful\u201d of Brexit. He spoke to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, on Tuesday morning, agreeing to have further discussions with her in New York at the UN general assembly next week. There are only three days left until the end of the 30-day deadline Merkel gave Johnson last month to come up with alternative solutions to remove the need for a backstop, which Eurosceptics in parliament refuse to vote for because it could keep the UK indefinitely in a customs union.

Johnson is mandated by the UK parliament to seek a three-month extension if he does not strike a Brexit deal by then. He has insisted he will not do this but has not set out how he would avoid such an outcome. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, refused on Tuesday to rule out a second prorogation as part of No 10\u2019s tactics to achieve a no-deal Brexit. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether the current suspension of parliament could happen again, Buckland said: \u201cHarold Wilson said a week is a long time in politics. It seems like an hour is a long time in politics at the moment. \u201cFor me to sit here and imagine what might happen at the end of October, I think, is idle. What I do know, if we are able to, we will have a Queen\u2019s speech in mid-October, there will be debate during that time and a vote as well, and perhaps a series of votes. \u201cParliament has already shown its power. It had a week in September where it made pretty significant legislation. I think the idea that somehow parliament has been prevented from having its voice doesn\u2019t seem to be borne out by events, frankly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jo Swinson has closed the Liberal Democrat conference with a message that the next election would be a fight for the \u201cheart and soul of Britain\u201d as she pledged to stop Brexit and counter the rising tide of populism and nationalism. Announcing to rapturous applause that she was appearing before delegates \u201cas your candidate for prime minister\u201d Swinson used her first conference speech as leader to renew attacks on Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. She said the country now needed the Lib Dems to give voters a better choice. Her address contained no new policy announcements but instead reiterated pledges made on previous days, notably that a Lib Dem majority government would stop the Brexit process without resorting to a second referendum. Her speech was also noticeably devoid of onerous references to the party\u2019s backing for a second referendum. Instead she focused on the Lib Dems\u2019 plan for a snap election \u2013 where in the case of a majority result, they would revoke article 50 \u2013 which has been divisive among some members. She also pledged to base future budgets not just on GDP figures but on factors of national wellbeing, inspired by a model used by the the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern. Policies would be developed by gauging their long-term impact on life satisfaction, happiness, anxiety and the feeling of whether something had been worthwhile. A similar proposal was made by Labour in June. There were promises to a set a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2045, create a new Green Investment Bank and tackle youth crime with a public health-based approach. Swinson\u2019s supporters said it was a speech intended to give members a broad brush idea of her vision for Britain, the EU and the party, and was not intended to be policy-heavy. At the next general election she said the country deserved \u201ca better choice than an entitled Etonian or a 1970s socialist\u201d, referring to the Conservative and Labour leaders respectively. \u201cAhead of us we have the fight of our lives for the heart and soul of Britain. The next few weeks are about deciding what kind of country we are, and who we want to be. Whether we tackle our biggest challenges with our closest allies, or on our own; whether we welcome those who want to build a better life in our country, or shut the door on them; whether we ensure every single child can go on and fulfil their dreams.\u201d On Brexit, Swinson pledged to revoke article 50 and thus stop Brexit \u201con day one\u201d as prime minister, \u201cbecause there is no Brexit that will be good for our country\u201d. Another standing ovation was received at the finale of the speech when she said: \u201cWe can change our politics, stop Brexit and win a brighter future.\u201d She condemned Johnson\u2019s push towards a no-deal departure, saying it would devastate the economy. \u201cThis Brexiteer government wants to pay for their ideology with other people\u2019s jobs. The truth is, they won\u2019t be affected, and they won\u2019t be there to help when the redundancy notices are handed out. \u201cThey won\u2019t be there when the homes are repossessed or when the marriages break down under the financial stress. Which makes what Boris Johnson is doing quite so sickening \u2013 he knows all of this.\u201d She criticised Corbyn, saying: \u201cNigel Farage might be Brexit by name, but it is very clear that Jeremy Corbyn is Brexit by nature.\u201d \u201cIf he had campaigned to remain in 2016 with half of the energy he had put into the 2017 election, we may have seen a different result.\u201d As the first woman to lead the Lib Dems, she received one of the warmest rounds of applause and cheers from members when she lambasted the prime minister\u2019s language. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s insults of choice are rather revealing. Big girl\u2019s blouse, girly swot. If he thinks being a woman is somehow a weakness, he\u2019s about to find out: it is not,\u201d she said. She ended her speech with: \u201cAt the next general election, voters will choose the kind of country we want to be: insular, closed and selfish; or collaborative, open and generous. \u201cWe can defeat nationalism and populism. We can change our politics, stop Brexit and win a brighter future.\u201d She spoke with ease for her debut conference speech, appearing to have memorised most of her 45-minute address and eschewing the traditional lectern. The 1997 Spice Girls track Spice Up Your Life was chosen as the backing track for her walk offstage to meet her husband Duncan Hames \u2013 a former Lib Dem MP \u2013 and her mother, Annette.",

It sounds simple, but when you want to impress, the temptation to overcomplicate food can leave you feeling overwhelmed and overworked. So how do you make food to remember, without breaking your back in the kitchen? The answer is to take inspiration from the French \u2013 not their haute cuisine, but their countryside cooking, which is just as tasty and a fraction of the effort.

These birds have been bred in the same French province for centuries, they have loads of space to run around, and they\u2019re encouraged to eat a varied diet. Because of all that, you can put it straight in the oven on a low heat for an hour, then take it out, cover it in salt, and put it back in on high for 15 minutes, and you\u2019ve got a meal for four that tastes out of this world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"right\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/2da9c654ec4be8df804e8b53737b45d455625c29/0_385_3805_4757/800.jpg&quot; data-alt=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Grey Goose Paris Pampelonne.

The prime minister\u2019s extended suspension of debate was carried out for an \u201cimproper purpose\u201d in order to \u201cavoid the risk of parliament undermining the policies of his executive\u201d, said Lord Pannick QC, who was representing the businesswoman and legal campaigner Gina Miller. Before the arguments formally began in central London, Lady Hale, the president of the supreme court, said it was facing \u201cserious and difficult questions\u201d. That was evidenced, she said, \u201cby the fact that three senior judges in Scotland have reached a different conclusion to three senior judges in England and Wales\u201d. She continued: \u201cThe supreme court exists to decide such difficult questions of law and we shall do so in accordance with our judicial oath.\u201d This declared the judges must reach their findings \u201cwithout fear or favour, affection or ill will\u201d. Hale stressed it was not the responsibility of the court to decide \u201cwhen or how the UK leaves the EU\u201d. Judgment is not expected until the end of the week at the earliest. In his written submission to the supreme court, Pannick wrote: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty to prorogue parliament for a period of five weeks is an unlawful abuse of power. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s reasons for advising on a five-week prorogation were improper in that they were infected by factors inconsistent with the concept of parliamentary sovereignty, in particular his belief that parliament does nothing of value at this time of year and his concern that parliament might take steps which would undermine the government\u2019s negotiating position with the EU. \u201cIf the judgment of the divisional court were to be upheld, the courts would have no power to review a prime minister\u2019s advice to prorogue parliament for a period of six months, one year or longer.\u201d At least 19 sitting days were being lost, Pannick said. \u201cIt is a remarkable feature of these proceedings that the prime minister has not made a witness statement explaining why he decided to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament for a period as long as five weeks and there is no evidence from the cabinet secretary or any other official explaining that.\u201d Pannick added: \u201cParliament will be silenced for a substantial part of the period leading up to the deadline of 31 October, when issues of grave national importance are being addressed (or not addressed) by the government \u2026 The evidence shows that the prime minister at best improperly regards parliament as an irrelevance.\u201d In written submissions on behalf of the prime minister, Sir James Eadie QC and Lord Keen QC, argued the claims were \u201cnon-justiciable\u201d because there were no \u201cjudicial or manageable standards by reference to which the courts could assess the lawfulness of [such] ministerial decisions\u201d.

Although reducing the consumption of meat and animal-based products globally could lower greenhouse gas emissions, it could also have adverse impacts on people\u2019s health and nutrition in some countries, according to a report published online in the Global Environmental Change journal on Monday. The report, which assessed dietary patterns across 140 countries, paints a complex picture of the country-specific implications of dietary changes on both people and the environment. \u201cWe need to be careful about oversimplifying things or prescribing a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019, western-centric solution to the challenges of diet and climate,\u201d said Martin Bloem, a director at Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future and one of the co-authors of the study. The report notes that many Britons are choosing vegetarian diets to reduce the environmental damage caused by their lifestyles, but suggests that they may better off going \u201ctwo-thirds vegan\u201d \u2013 eliminating animal products including meat and dairy from two in three meals. For a British person, going vegetarian would reduce the climate impact attributable to their diet by 36%, while cutting meat and dairy out of two-thirds of their meals would reduce it by 61%. That\u2019s because dairy has a relatively high carbon footprint. In other countries, the impact of meat-based diets could be hugely different \u2013 for example, a pound of beef produced in Paraguay contributes nearly 17 times more greenhouse gases than a pound of beef produced in Denmark, partly to do with the deforestation involved in beef production in Paraguay. According to the study\u2019s authors, diet-related solutions to the climate crisis ought to be sustainable and address the problems of undernutrition, obesity, poverty and economic development. Achieving healthy diet in most low- and middle-income countries could require an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and water use due to food production. \u201cIt is critical to recognise that different countries have different priorities and are at different stages of development \u2013 meaning there are different imperatives for these countries and their populations,\u201d Bloem said. \u201cA top-down diktat that recommends a plant-based diet without taking into account the nutritional needs of vulnerable populations or the availability of certain foodstuffs is neither helpful nor appropriate,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fact is that in low-income countries, some people, especially young children, will need to eat more animal products, particularly dairy and eggs, to get adequate protein, vitamins, and minerals. Consequently the diet-related emissions and use of freshwater in these places will have to rise.

      "body": "<p>British author Joe Abercrombie may have sold five million copies of his violent, darkly humorous fantasy novels, and had his books praised by reigning overlord of the genre, George RR Martin (\u201cbloody and relentless\u201d). But the first time he sat down to write what he believed would be \u201cthe great British fantasy novel\u201d, it didn\u2019t go well.</p> <p>Growing up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/04/david-eddings-dies\">David Eddings</a> and Dragonlance, Abercrombie was aiming for full-blown epic fantasy when he made a stab at his own novel in his early 20s. He managed a few chapters, but it was \u201cabsolutely pompous\u201d, he admits now, away from his home in Bath to meet with his publishers in London.</p> <p>A decade later, he tried again. He kept the same characters, the same storyline, but \u201cstraight away it had this much more world-weary, humorous voice,\u201d he says. \u201cI was taking myself, and the fantasy genre, much less seriously.\u201d</p> <p>The story began to work. Abercrombie spent months refining every paragraph, even \u201ctaking it seriously enough\u201d to show it to his parents, who are still his first readers and biggest critics. \u201cI can remember my mother saying \u2013 she denies this \u2013 \u2018This is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be\u2019. I knew then that I was on to something.\u201d</p> <p>That something was 2006\u2019s <a href=\"https://joeabercrombie.com/books/the-blade-itself/\">The Blade Itself</a>, following the adventures of torturer Inquisitor Glokta, barbarian warrior Logen Ninefingers, and the dashing but vain swordsman Jezal dan Luthar.

      "bodyText": "British author Joe Abercrombie may have sold five million copies of his violent, darkly humorous fantasy novels, and had his books praised by reigning overlord of the genre, George RR Martin (\u201cbloody and relentless\u201d). But the first time he sat down to write what he believed would be \u201cthe great British fantasy novel\u201d, it didn\u2019t go well. Growing up on David Eddings and Dragonlance, Abercrombie was aiming for full-blown epic fantasy when he made a stab at his own novel in his early 20s. He managed a few chapters, but it was \u201cabsolutely pompous\u201d, he admits now, away from his home in Bath to meet with his publishers in London. A decade later, he tried again. He kept the same characters, the same storyline, but \u201cstraight away it had this much more world-weary, humorous voice,\u201d he says. \u201cI was taking myself, and the fantasy genre, much less seriously.\u201d The story began to work. Abercrombie spent months refining every paragraph, even \u201ctaking it seriously enough\u201d to show it to his parents, who are still his first readers and biggest critics. \u201cI can remember my mother saying \u2013 she denies this \u2013 \u2018This is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be\u2019. I knew then that I was on to something.\u201d That something was 2006\u2019s The Blade Itself, following the adventures of torturer Inquisitor Glokta, barbarian warrior Logen Ninefingers, and the dashing but vain swordsman Jezal dan Luthar. Gritty, violent, cynical and redolent with dark humour, \u201cit was my take on Lord of the Rings, but bringing in all my weird preoccupations about how people work, the nature of violence. It\u2019s a reaction against the shiny and optimistic heroic fantasy I read as a teenager. In trying to do the opposite, it becomes quite pessimistic and grim.\u201d Unusually for epic fantasy, the story takes place at a time when money is becoming the new power and the middle classes are rising; mercantile forces are afoot. \u201cThe fantasy I read as a kid did often take place in this medieval sandbox where nothing really developed or changed, where conflict comes from a battle between an objective good and evil rather than rising out of social forces and changes as it does in the real world.

It\u2019s possible you could manage to kill this battery in less than a day, but you\u2019d have to really try. The battery life is great, just like the iPhone XR\u2019s battery life was great.</p> <p>What\u2019s less great is the fact that Apple is still putting its ancient 5W charger in the box, even though the iPhone 11 Pro has an 18W USB-C fast charger. If Apple isn\u2019t going to update the entire line to a fast charger, it should just do the environment a favour and stop putting the 5W charger in the box entirely; there are literally billions of them in the world, and odds are, you have more than one in a drawer already.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Britta O\u2019Boyle and Stuart Miles from Pocket-lint said <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/reviews/apple/149322-apple-iphone-11-review\">most will be happy with the LCD display</a> of the iPhone 11, but corners had been cut:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In reality, the iPhone 11 has a display that will more than satisfy most users. It\u2019s not as sharp in resolution as the likes of the iPhone 11 Pro, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/07/samsung-galaxy-note-10-launch-big-screens-and-stylus-air-gestures\">Samsung Galaxy Note 10</a> for example, and it doesn\u2019t offer mobile HDR compatibility like these other devices either, but the iPhone 11 still offers a decent screen with ample brightness and arguably more realistic colours than the Pro models and other OLED smartphones.</p> <p>The omission of HDR on the iPhone 11 means that while it tries to deliver a HDR-like experience for compatible content, it\u2019s not the real deal. Smart HDR pictures don\u2019t pop as much when viewing on screen as they do on the iPhone 11 Pro, and you can\u2019t see as much detail on a dark TV show or movie that\u2019s available in HDR, as you can on the 11 Pro \u2013 but it\u2019s also one of the few compromises the iPhone 11 makes to the Pro models.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The iPhone 11\u2019s improved selfie camera now with slow-motion selfies was <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/reviews/apple-iphone-11-review/\">a magnet for Cnet\u2019s Scott Stein\u2019s kids</a>:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The wider-angled front-facing camera is welcome, and digitally zooms in or out to accommodate a wider view that fits in more people and background. The 12-megapixel front-facing camera looks better, and I was happy with the results, but you have to be artful with the wider camera. Sometimes I ended up looking like a little face in a mountain of shirt.</p> <p>My kids instantly started messing around with slow-motion selfie feature. Yes, that\u2019s the Slofie. It\u2019s not a Live Photo, though. It\u2019s just a video mode. That makes it hard to do much with, because the file sizes get large. I do, however, have a lot of extended 240-fps slow-motion scenes of my kids sticking out their tongues.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Wired\u2019s Lauren Goode <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-11/\">was impressed</a> by the new dual camera on the iPhone 11:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This year\u2019s iPhone 11 has two rear lenses, a wide-angle lens and an ultrawide lens with a 120-degree field of view. Last year\u2019s iPhone XR had a single lens, and any depth effects added to photos were done computationally. This means the iPhone 11 now captures enough information to take better photos from the start \u2013 and especially portrait photos.</p> <p>Case in point: last year\u2019s iPhone XR could capture a portrait photo of a person but not a pet or object. The iPhone 11 now takes portrait photos of my cat, which he is pleased about. Just kidding: he is indifferent, per usual.</p> <p>The iPhone 11 is a very good camera, and in a lot of situations it even performed better than last year\u2019s top-of-the-line <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/04/apple-iphone-xs-review-battery-life-camera-design-performance\">iPhone XS</a>. But the iPhone 11 Pro takes noticeably better photos, whether standard photos, portrait images, or night mode pics.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Rhiannon Williams from the i predicts the splash of colour on the new iPhone 11 models <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/iphone-11-release-tech-review-latest/\">will be a big draw</a>, as the smartphone industry moves away from dull black and grey:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like the XR and 5c series before it, a large part of the iPhone 11\u2019s appeal lies in its range of six shades: red, black, white, yellow, green and purple. This is the first ever purple iPhone, and Apple has chosen the <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/tag/instagram/\">Instagram</a>-baiting shade of lilac popularised by the likes of Ariana Grande and South Korean pop sensations BTS \u2013 Generation Z\u2019s equivalent of millennial pink.</p> <p>It\u2019s pretty \u2013 a stylish splash of lavender Apple knows will have aesthetically-minded iPhone owners clamouring to upgrade (as evidenced by its new range of transparent cases). These are phones to be shown off, not hidden behind rubber or leather sheaths, and even if you do cover it up with a case, Apple is banking on the satisfaction of owning a phone in a colour you\u2019re attached to.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Gareth Beavis from TechRadar was <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/iphone-11-review\">won over by the iPhone 11</a>:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall the iPhone 11 is a triumph for Apple \u2013 if, for nothing else, the fact it\u2019s managed to lower the price year-on-year. We feel enough people are going to be won over by the hard-working camera \u2026 and the safety that buying a modern smartphone gives you.</p> <p>You should be able to achieve years of use from this phone, and sure, you could also consider the iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max if you want more power and higher spec, but we found the iPhone 11 to be fun to use and often outperformed what we would expect given the price \u2013 and that\u2019s a feat some wouldn\u2019t have expected from Apple.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Brian X Chen from the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/technology/personaltech/apple-iphone-11-review.html\">has a slightly different view</a>, asking whether it\u2019s still worth upgrading your iPhone every two years:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Based on my tests of the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, the answer is no. Don\u2019t get me wrong: the newest models are nice. Apple has made them speedier, improved the cameras and lengthened their battery life. The new lineup also starts at a lower price of $700, down from $750 a year ago, which is a relief in an era of skyrocketing smartphone costs.</p> <p>But none of this is enough to warrant an immediate upgrade if you have had your smartphone for only two years. The latest iPhones just aren\u2019t a big leap forward from last year\u2019s iPhones or even the iPhone X from 2017.</p> <p>So here\u2019s what I ultimately suggest: you should definitely upgrade if your current device is at least five years old. The iPhone 11 models are all a significant step up from those introduced in 2014. But for everyone else with smartphones from 2015 or later, there is no rush to buy. Instead, there is more mileage and value to be had out of the excellent smartphone you already own.</p> </blockquote> <h2>iPhone 11 Pro</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97e054f0d202b6eab2fd89461a28fd80287cac0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97e054f0d202b6eab2fd89461a28fd80287cac0b/1035_414_1878_1128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The camera is the main focus of the iPhone 11 Pro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The camera is the main focus of the iPhone 11 Pro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u00a31,049 iPhone 11 Pro and \u00a31,149 11 Pro Max top the iPhone 11 with higher resolution 5.8in and 6.5in OLED screens respectively. They also have a new triple camera system on the back \u2013 their main differentiator over the significantly cheaper model.</p> <h2>Patel was less complimentary about the battery life on the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. It\u2019s better but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price\">not quite enough to prevent battery anxiety</a>:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The iPhone 11 Pro Max I\u2019ve been using every day for a week has consistently run for 12 to 14 hours on a single charge, with over 10 hours of screen-on time reported in the battery settings per 24-hour period.</p> <p>That\u2019s compared to eight to 10 hours of battery life at most for my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/27/iphone-xs-max-review-apple-supersized-smartphone\">iPhone XS Max</a>, which is a marked improvement.

      "bodyText": "The early reviews of Apple\u2019s iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are in from publications with early access to the three models. While the iPhone 11 Pro is the most impressive technically, with a new triple camera system catching up to the competition, it is the iPhone 11, the cheapest of the bunch, that is winning the majority of people over. Questions remain as to whether it\u2019s worth upgrading at all, however, if your iPhone is less than five years old. The Guardian will have its own reviews of the new iPhones in the next week or so once they have gone on sale, but in the meantime here\u2019s what those given early access by Apple had to say. iPhone 11 Costing from \u00a3729, the iPhone 11 has a 6.1in LCD screen, two cameras on the back but the same processor and storage sizes as the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. Nilay Patel from the Verge praised the iPhone 11\u2019s battery, but wasn\u2019t so happy about the included charger: In our tests, the iPhone 11 easily lasted a full day at a time and then some. It\u2019s possible you could manage to kill this battery in less than a day, but you\u2019d have to really try. The battery life is great, just like the iPhone XR\u2019s battery life was great. What\u2019s less great is the fact that Apple is still putting its ancient 5W charger in the box, even though the iPhone 11 Pro has an 18W USB-C fast charger. If Apple isn\u2019t going to update the entire line to a fast charger, it should just do the environment a favour and stop putting the 5W charger in the box entirely; there are literally billions of them in the world, and odds are, you have more than one in a drawer already. Britta O\u2019Boyle and Stuart Miles from Pocket-lint said most will be happy with the LCD display of the iPhone 11, but corners had been cut: In reality, the iPhone 11 has a display that will more than satisfy most users. It\u2019s not as sharp in resolution as the likes of the iPhone 11 Pro, or the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 for example, and it doesn\u2019t offer mobile HDR compatibility like these other devices either, but the iPhone 11 still offers a decent screen with ample brightness and arguably more realistic colours than the Pro models and other OLED smartphones. The omission of HDR on the iPhone 11 means that while it tries to deliver a HDR-like experience for compatible content, it\u2019s not the real deal. Smart HDR pictures don\u2019t pop as much when viewing on screen as they do on the iPhone 11 Pro, and you can\u2019t see as much detail on a dark TV show or movie that\u2019s available in HDR, as you can on the 11 Pro \u2013 but it\u2019s also one of the few compromises the iPhone 11 makes to the Pro models. The iPhone 11\u2019s improved selfie camera now with slow-motion selfies was a magnet for Cnet\u2019s Scott Stein\u2019s kids: The wider-angled front-facing camera is welcome, and digitally zooms in or out to accommodate a wider view that fits in more people and background. The 12-megapixel front-facing camera looks better, and I was happy with the results, but you have to be artful with the wider camera. Sometimes I ended up looking like a little face in a mountain of shirt. My kids instantly started messing around with slow-motion selfie feature. Yes, that\u2019s the Slofie. It\u2019s not a Live Photo, though. It\u2019s just a video mode. That makes it hard to do much with, because the file sizes get large. I do, however, have a lot of extended 240-fps slow-motion scenes of my kids sticking out their tongues. Wired\u2019s Lauren Goode was impressed by the new dual camera on the iPhone 11: This year\u2019s iPhone 11 has two rear lenses, a wide-angle lens and an ultrawide lens with a 120-degree field of view. Last year\u2019s iPhone XR had a single lens, and any depth effects added to photos were done computationally. This means the iPhone 11 now captures enough information to take better photos from the start \u2013 and especially portrait photos. Case in point: last year\u2019s iPhone XR could capture a portrait photo of a person but not a pet or object. The iPhone 11 now takes portrait photos of my cat, which he is pleased about. Just kidding: he is indifferent, per usual. The iPhone 11 is a very good camera, and in a lot of situations it even performed better than last year\u2019s top-of-the-line iPhone XS. But the iPhone 11 Pro takes noticeably better photos, whether standard photos, portrait images, or night mode pics. Rhiannon Williams from the i predicts the splash of colour on the new iPhone 11 models will be a big draw, as the smartphone industry moves away from dull black and grey: Like the XR and 5c series before it, a large part of the iPhone 11\u2019s appeal lies in its range of six shades: red, black, white, yellow, green and purple. This is the first ever purple iPhone, and Apple has chosen the Instagram-baiting shade of lilac popularised by the likes of Ariana Grande and South Korean pop sensations BTS \u2013 Generation Z\u2019s equivalent of millennial pink. It\u2019s pretty \u2013 a stylish splash of lavender Apple knows will have aesthetically-minded iPhone owners clamouring to upgrade (as evidenced by its new range of transparent cases). These are phones to be shown off, not hidden behind rubber or leather sheaths, and even if you do cover it up with a case, Apple is banking on the satisfaction of owning a phone in a colour you\u2019re attached to. Gareth Beavis from TechRadar was won over by the iPhone 11: Overall the iPhone 11 is a triumph for Apple \u2013 if, for nothing else, the fact it\u2019s managed to lower the price year-on-year. We feel enough people are going to be won over by the hard-working camera \u2026 and the safety that buying a modern smartphone gives you. You should be able to achieve years of use from this phone, and sure, you could also consider the iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max if you want more power and higher spec, but we found the iPhone 11 to be fun to use and often outperformed what we would expect given the price \u2013 and that\u2019s a feat some wouldn\u2019t have expected from Apple. Brian X Chen from the New York Times has a slightly different view, asking whether it\u2019s still worth upgrading your iPhone every two years: Based on my tests of the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, the answer is no. Don\u2019t get me wrong: the newest models are nice. Apple has made them speedier, improved the cameras and lengthened their battery life. The new lineup also starts at a lower price of $700, down from $750 a year ago, which is a relief in an era of skyrocketing smartphone costs. But none of this is enough to warrant an immediate upgrade if you have had your smartphone for only two years. The latest iPhones just aren\u2019t a big leap forward from last year\u2019s iPhones or even the iPhone X from 2017. So here\u2019s what I ultimately suggest: you should definitely upgrade if your current device is at least five years old. The iPhone 11 models are all a significant step up from those introduced in 2014. But for everyone else with smartphones from 2015 or later, there is no rush to buy. Instead, there is more mileage and value to be had out of the excellent smartphone you already own. iPhone 11 Pro The \u00a31,049 iPhone 11 Pro and \u00a31,149 11 Pro Max top the iPhone 11 with higher resolution 5.8in and 6.5in OLED screens respectively. They also have a new triple camera system on the back \u2013 their main differentiator over the significantly cheaper model. Patel was less complimentary about the battery life on the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. It\u2019s better but not quite enough to prevent battery anxiety: The iPhone 11 Pro Max I\u2019ve been using every day for a week has consistently run for 12 to 14 hours on a single charge, with over 10 hours of screen-on time reported in the battery settings per 24-hour period. That\u2019s compared to eight to 10 hours of battery life at most for my iPhone XS Max, which is a marked improvement. It\u2019s not enough to make me stop charging at my desk throughout the day, and I\u2019ll definitely still carry a battery pack on trips. Williams could see the Super Retina XDR making an excellent screen better in a small but meaningful way: Apple has chosen to stick to the same resolution as last year\u2019s handsets but has spruced them up with a new OLED panel with a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio called Super Retina XDR. In practice, this means the displays are both bolder and brighter and display colours more accurately. I found this was best exemplified when examining skin tones in the same pictures side-by-side with the iPhone XS Max. Caucasian skin on the XS Max appears pinker and more flushed, whereas the same picture looks truer-to-life. Likewise, the 11 Pro Max picks out facial highlights and hair undertones not as apparent in the same picture over on the XS Max. It\u2019s a small difference, but an impressive one. Stein says there are essentially two reasons to pick the iPhone 11 Pro Max over the smaller 11 Pro: This year\u2019s most expensive iPhone is the $1,449 (\u00a31,499) iPhone Pro Max with 512GB of storage. Even with 256GB of storage \u2013 the minimum you\u2019ll likely want for a high-end phone like this \u2013 it will set you back $1,249 (\u00a31,299).

And, well, this would be that phone. It\u2019s also more fun for movies and games, but at these prices, I\u2019d just buy a separate iPad for that. Beavis felt that the expense of the iPhone 11 Pro was difficult to justify: Overall, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is a real step forward, and the most advanced iPhone yet.

Goode found the all-important camera on the iPhone 11 Pro Max to be a mixed bag: While Apple says frequently that its integrated hardware and software enable it to do magical things with cameras \u2013 and in some cases, that\u2019s true \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean every shot taken on the iPhone 11 Pro phones was the best photo.

They are crudely caricatured either as rabidly rightwing pensioners sunning themselves on the Costa Brava, who probably backed Brexit anyway and are only now grasping the consequences, or as Dordogne-dwelling chatterati hopelessly out of touch with how their compatriots back home feel. But the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/how-many-uk-citizens-live-other-eu-countries/\" title=\"\">estimated 1.3 million Britons</a> who live in the EU aren\u2019t cartoon characters. They\u2019re human beings, who moved abroad for love or work or the chance of a better life, and never expected to be hung out to dry for it. No wonder they are taking it personally.</p> <p>Those whose lives are now up in the air range from students at European universities and people who moved with their companies for work, to dual-nationality couples who wanted to let their kids experience both sides of their heritage, or people who worked hard all their lives and dreamed of retiring somewhere the cost of living was cheaper. They just grasped the opportunities we were all given in an era of open borders, and which until recently nobody expected to lose, only to be caught in the political crossfire.</p> <p>For there is nothing inevitable about them becoming casualties of Brexit, even now; in any sensibly negotiated deal to leave, their rights could be protected, and so could those of EU citizens here.

Those who married EU citizens worry about whether their partners would be allowed in, or whether families would be separated at the border. And all of them are trying to make decisions in the dark, still unsure whether in six weeks\u2019 time they will be facing utter chaos, a smooth transition period with their rights intact, or just another extension and more uncertainty. In the circumstances, the scandal isn\u2019t that a handful of protesters spoilt Johnson\u2019s press conference, or that Bettel\u2019s handling of it was ungracious. It\u2019s that not enough people are listening to what these protesters were actually trying to say.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

They are crudely caricatured either as rabidly rightwing pensioners sunning themselves on the Costa Brava, who probably backed Brexit anyway and are only now grasping the consequences, or as Dordogne-dwelling chatterati hopelessly out of touch with how their compatriots back home feel. But the estimated 1.3 million Britons who live in the EU aren\u2019t cartoon characters. They\u2019re human beings, who moved abroad for love or work or the chance of a better life, and never expected to be hung out to dry for it. No wonder they are taking it personally. Those whose lives are now up in the air range from students at European universities and people who moved with their companies for work, to dual-nationality couples who wanted to let their kids experience both sides of their heritage, or people who worked hard all their lives and dreamed of retiring somewhere the cost of living was cheaper. They just grasped the opportunities we were all given in an era of open borders, and which until recently nobody expected to lose, only to be caught in the political crossfire. For there is nothing inevitable about them becoming casualties of Brexit, even now; in any sensibly negotiated deal to leave, their rights could be protected, and so could those of EU citizens here. Their chronic anxiety is a direct consequence of Johnson\u2019s decision to put no deal \u2013 and with it no visible safety net \u2013 back on the table. Some may simply choose to come home to Britain, but for others it won\u2019t be that easy. Those who married EU citizens worry about whether their partners would be allowed in, or whether families would be separated at the border. And all of them are trying to make decisions in the dark, still unsure whether in six weeks\u2019 time they will be facing utter chaos, a smooth transition period with their rights intact, or just another extension and more uncertainty. In the circumstances, the scandal isn\u2019t that a handful of protesters spoilt Johnson\u2019s press conference, or that Bettel\u2019s handling of it was ungracious. It\u2019s that not enough people are listening to what these protesters were actually trying to say. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

They also said others were pushed towards the far right by the amount of hate speech and fake news they read every day.</p> <p>They describe being ground down by the volume of the work, numbed by the graphic violence, nudity and bullying they have to view for eight hours a day, working nights and weekends, for \u201cpractically minimum pay\u201d.</p> <p>A little-discussed aspect of Facebook\u2019s moderation was particularly distressing to the contractors: vetting private conversations between adults and minors that have been flagged by algorithms as likely sexual exploitation.</p> <p>Such private chats, of which \u201c90% are sexual\u201d, were \u201cviolating and creepy\u201d, one moderator said. \u201cYou understand something more about this sort of dystopic society we are building every day,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have rich white men from Europe, from the US, writing to children from the Philippines \u2026 they try to get sexual photos in exchange for $10 or $20.\u201d</p> <p>Gina, a contractor, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a breach of human rights. You cannot ask someone to work fast, to work well and to see graphic content.

As a contemporary society, we are running into this new thing \u2013 the internet \u2013 and we have to find some rules to deal with it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to create a team, for example in a social network, aiming to protect users from abusers, hate speech, racial prejudice, better pornographic software, etc. But I think it\u2019s important to open a debate about this job. We need to share our stories, because people don\u2019t know anything about us, about our job, about what we do to earn a living.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the moderators\u2019 stories were similar to the problems experienced in other countries. Daniel said: \u201cOnce, I found a colleague of ours checking online, looking to purchase a Taser, because he started to feel scared about others. He confessed he was really concerned about walking through the streets at night, for example, or being surrounded by foreign people.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe because all this hate speech we have to face every day affects our political view somehow. So a normal person, a liberal person, maybe also a progressive person, can get more conservative, more concerned about issues like migrants for example. Indeed, many of the hate speech contents we receive on a daily basis are fake news \u2026 which aim to share very particular political views.\u201d</p> <p>In February, the technology site the Verge produced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona\">one of the first behind-the-scenes reports</a> from a US Facebook contractor.

Just as the Arizona moderators were reportedly turning to drugs and alcohol, so were those in Germany. \u201cI saw a lot of big consumer drugs in the company,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any way to destress. The company, technically, is against drugs.\u201d</p> <p>When trying to go down a more legitimate route of self-help, the American moderators complained about the psychological help that was provided. \u201cThe on-site counsellors were largely passive,\u201d the Verge reporter Casey Newton wrote, \u201crelying on workers to recognise the signs of anxiety and depression and seek help.\u201d</p> <p>Berlin moderators were also critical of the counselling services provided and suggested they leaned too heavily on the state\u2019s universal healthcare.</p> <p>Daniel said: \u201cIn the end, we didn\u2019t have proper psychological support. We had some colleagues who went to the [counsellor], and when they showed that they had real problems, they were invited to go outside the company and find a proper psychologist.\u201d</p> <p>The Verge report appeared to trigger reforms. Moderators in Berlin said after the article was published there had been immediate interest from Facebook\u2019s head office in their workload.

We didn\u2019t have any limit for a while, but now they have re-established another limit. The limit now is between 400 and 500 tickets.\u201d The new cap \u2013 or number of tickets \u2013 was half that of the previous one but still required workers achieve about a ticket a minute. However, that volume of work was what their American colleagues had faced before the reforms.</p> <p>Berlin moderators have discussed whether to seek help from the unions, but say the nature of the work makes it difficult. Gina said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say no one is interested, but no one has the possibility to do something for real.\u201d</p> <p>John added: \u201cThey are so tired.\u201d</p> <p>While the moderators agreed such work was necessary they said the problems were fixable. Daniel said: \u201cI think it\u2019s important to open a debate about this job,\u201d adding that the solution was simple \u2013 \u201chire more people\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement, Facebook said: \u201cContent moderators do vital work to keep our community safe, and we take our responsibility to ensure their wellbeing incredibly seriously. We work closely with our partners to ensure they provide the support people need, including training, psychological support and technology to limit their exposure to graphic content.</p> <p>\u201cContent moderation is a new and challenging industry, so we are always learning and looking to improve how it is managed. We take any reports that our high standards are not being met seriously and are working with our partner to look into these concerns.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the specific claim that one moderator had been hoarding examples of graphic violence, Facebook said: \u201cIn Berlin, as well as in all other review sites, the devices used by our content reviewers have also been adapted to ensure people cannot save any content they review. This includes disabling USB drives and the ability to print screens, and blocking external email providers. Phones and smart watches are also not allowed on the floor or in training rooms. Any suggestion that we allow our content reviewers to save content they have reviewed into a \u2018personal collection\u2019 is false.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

Daniel said: \u201cI think it\u2019s important to open a debate about this job,\u201d adding that the solution was simple \u2013 \u201chire more people\u201d. In a statement, Facebook said: \u201cContent moderators do vital work to keep our community safe, and we take our responsibility to ensure their wellbeing incredibly seriously. We work closely with our partners to ensure they provide the support people need, including training, psychological support and technology to limit their exposure to graphic content. \u201cContent moderation is a new and challenging industry, so we are always learning and looking to improve how it is managed. We take any reports that our high standards are not being met seriously and are working with our partner to look into these concerns.\u201d In response to the specific claim that one moderator had been hoarding examples of graphic violence, Facebook said: \u201cIn Berlin, as well as in all other review sites, the devices used by our content reviewers have also been adapted to ensure people cannot save any content they review. This includes disabling USB drives and the ability to print screens, and blocking external email providers. Phones and smart watches are also not allowed on the floor or in training rooms. Any suggestion that we allow our content reviewers to save content they have reviewed into a \u2018personal collection\u2019 is false.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "bodyText": "Two climate crisis protesters who removed Emmanuel Macron\u2019s portrait from an official building were justified in doing so because of the severity of the environmental emergency, a judge has said. The judge in Lyon acquitted the pair of theft in a ruling hailed as historic by campaigners. In February, a group of 20 activists entered the town hall in a district of the French city. Two of them, Fanny Delahalle, 33, and Pierre Goinciv, 32, removed a portrait of the president, copies of which hang in all official buildings in France. They were pictured holding the gold-framed portrait outside the entrance of the building. Prosecutors demanded they be fined \u20ac500 (\u00a3445). The public prosecutor, Rozenn Huon, told the court: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly theft and it has done nothing to help climate change.\u201d The judge conceded \u201can object of a very strong symbolic value\u201d had been stolen but said the climate crisis was more serious. \u201cClimate change is a constant that seriously affects the future of humanity by provoking natural catastrophes that poorer countries don\u2019t have the means to protect themselves against,\u201d he said. \u201cIf France has undertaken internally \u2026 to respect objectives as the government has, objectives that are probably insufficient but are at least necessary, the documents produced by the defence testify that these objectives will not be reached.\u201d He added that the group\u2019s \u201cintrusion\u201d into the town hall had caused only a limited disturbance to public order and the protesters\u2019 actions were a \u201clegitimate call on the president\u201d. The public prosecutor\u2019s office said it would appeal against the decision. The campaign group ANV-COP21 welcomed the acquittal, saying it took into account France\u2019s \u201cnon-respect of climate objectives and the legitimacy of actions of civil disobedience faced with the urgency of the climate problem\u201d. A climate protester who carried out a similar action in May was fined \u20ac250. Delahalle told BFMTV: \u201cThe judge showed great courage making a decision that could affect his career. It is a rare and historic decision \u2026 we hope it will influence other judges.

There are, of course, many coming of age films but none, I think, as poetic and haunting as this. It was the first film my eldest son took me to see and at 18 he was just emerging out of the chaos of adolescence meanwhile his two younger brothers were still in the labyrinth... with some years to go. As a mother and a teacher no other film has come close to reminding me how hard it is to leave, or be forced to leave, the relative certainties of childhood and form your own moral code in an adult world beset by compromises.</p> <h2>Lives of Others (2006)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018I expected to see it in the top 10\u2019: <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133081665\">skoolboyerror</a></strong></p> <p>I expected to see The Lives of Others and Pan\u2019s Labyrinth in the top 10. Mainly because Ted is in at No. 60. Much as I love Seth McFarlane, his film doesn\u2019t deserve to be anywhere near either of those masterpieces.</p> <p>I cannot fathom how The Lives of Others is not listed. The greatest and most poignant last line of any film ever. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133084701\">cwiseman</a></strong></p> <h2>No Country for Old Men (2007)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018It\u2019s Kubrickianly good\u2019: <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133077458\">sulcus</a></strong></p> <p>No Country for Old Men was better than There Will Be Blood in 2007 and still is. It\u2019s more exciting, but underneath that, it\u2019s about how our society\u2019s changing structure has gradually but steadily rewarded the behaviour of psychopaths, and punished the behaviour of the socially motivated. That\u2019s not an over deep reading of the film. That\u2019s what Tommy Lee Jones actually discusses in voiceover. This encroaching darkness he can\u2019t understand, compared to his father\u2019s experiences in the same job. It\u2019s fantastic in every way, right up to its abrupt end with a random car accident. It\u2019s clearly the best film of this century so far, it\u2019s Kubrickianly good. Better than most of the Kubricks actually, it\u2019s close to perfect.</p> <h2>Paddington 2 (2017)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Basically it\u2019s amazing\u2019: <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133079885\">Invader_Ace</a></strong></p> <p>Paddington 2 is perfect. A solid simple story, with every little throwaway joke actually a set up for something bigger later on. All the cast are on point and it has a superb ending that finishes at exactly the right point. It commits to its emotional moments without the need to undercut with a sarcastic jibe or punchline. Basically it\u2019s amazing and if you aren\u2019t moved by that final shot you\u2019re basically dead inside. I wish my kids watched it more often and that is something no parent says about any family/kids film ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c673a7a6be14e63d4c505eed46b0a257fa3adb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c673a7a6be14e63d4c505eed46b0a257fa3adb7/334_0_1208_726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PADDINGTON 2 - FILM PRESS STILL\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paddington 2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018I thought it was amazing\u2019: <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133080283\">Laoi Primorac \u00d3 Murch\u00fa</a></strong></p> <p>It was the weekend of the Spurs West Ham FA Cup match (if League or League Cup please shout). Was watching in a bar off the main street with girlfriend and friends. We\u2019d already mused the possibility of the cinema that day and CTHD was on at some hour cutting into the game. Okay, whatever, off we went, me and my blonde bombshell. I thought it was amazing, still do. She said it was the most stupid movie ever. I missed the Hammers in action for that sort of reaction? I knew then it was not to be.</p> <h2>Son of Saul (2015)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Traumatic subject, devastating film\u2019: <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133085988\">Veltatecla</a></strong></p> <p>Son of Saul for me. I took twice the length of the film to watch it, paused it often to breathe. It\u2019s a film I wouldn\u2019t watch in a cinema, I had to watch it privately. Traumatic subject, devastating film, I was almost glad when the group died as they inevitably would so there was no chance of being returned. The appearance of the little boy and the only smile in the film, half smile, slight smile, made it OK for the man to die. It\u2019s not my right to be thankful that people died so maybe I took the cowardly way out by being something akin to relieved that I didn\u2019t have to see, think and feel anymore.</p> <h2>Your Name (2016)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018It covers every emotion I want in a film\u2019: <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133086610\">bcdcdude</a></strong></p> <p>When thinking of my best films of this decade (I have yet to work out the best between 2000 and 2009), it was a three-way tie between The Tree of Life, Our Little Sister (by Shoplifters director Hirokazu Kore-eda) and Your Name. I\u2019ve decided to go for Your Name, for the simple reason that it covers almost every emotion I want in a film; joy, wonder, sadness, curiosity, longing, loving and the sheer thrill of being alive to watch something so amazing. I\u2019ve watched it three times and each time, it makes me cry. Very few films have ever done that, but to make me cry with simultaneous joy and sadness is a very rare feat.</p> <h2>Timbuktu (2014)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Funny and tragic\u2019: <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/133089054\">ID4460697</a></strong></p> <p>Great list, but my top winge is the omission of Timbuktu. Against a stunning landscape and the old city, the Taliban enforce their version of Islam on tolerant ancient local Muslim culture. Some really cinematic acts of defiance the boys show such as forbidden to play football they play with an imaginary ball. A woman stately as a queen, her bright African prints trailing the dirt owns the street in her defiance of sharia fashion. Funny and tragic.</p> <h2>The Fall (2006)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018I can watch this over and over again\u2019: Cheryl, 60, Leeds</strong></p> <p>I love this film because it is so multi layered. On the surface is the intriguing situation of the main players in the hospital where they are being treated, Roy, the paralysed stuntman who is clearly seeing his life unravel after a life changing accident on a film set and young Alexandria, the little girl who has broken her arm and initially seems to be the silent narrator as the film unfolds as observed by her. The relationship that develops between them provides a growing emotional tension as he begins to narrate a fairy tale for her in exchange for her collusion in helping him procure the drugs he needs to end his life. The film sets, colour and imagery in this film make it something I can watch over and over again alongside the superb acting of the key characters.</p> <h2>Downfall (2004)</h2> <p><strong>\u2018A tremendous performance from the late Bruno Ganz\u2019: Heather, 38, London</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a controversial choice, but I love 20th century history, so this biopic of Hitler\u2019s last days in the bunker is a film that has stayed with me over the years. It\u2019s a great film, with a tremendous, underrated performance from the late Bruno Ganz. It is both fascinating, horrifying and tragic. And, of course, it\u2019s the only film to have an afterlife as a YouTube meme, a specific 21st Century phenomenon, with that brilliant scene of Hitler realising the war is lost, being overdubbed with all sorts of daft stuff.</p>",

The first cracked Smith on the forearm; the second careered into the back of his neck and sent him sprawling to the floor.

Ben Stokes and Jack Leach hauled England to an unthinkable victory with a show of great resilience \u2013 the latter earning himself a lifetime supply of Specsavers glasses to boot.</p> <p>But how did it ever come to that? For the second Test running, the start of play was delayed by rain. Australia collapsed to 179 all out in their first innings and Archer ended with figures of six for 45. However, England were woeful in reply: all out for only 67, it was their 12th lowest Test score of all time. Josh Hazlewood picked up a five-wicket haul for the visitors and England looked like they had thrown the Ashes away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebf55a275e98c0f296c9dda5ee8aeaed9fee0fa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebf55a275e98c0f296c9dda5ee8aeaed9fee0fa8/0_0_5017_3345/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans entertain themselves during a rain break on day one.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans entertain themselves during a rain break on day one.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"ba5e54a8470363f5235030b22823f82265a68113\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba5e54a8470363f5235030b22823f82265a68113/118_18_3393_2262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Pattinson tries to stop a shot off from Joe Root his own bowling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Pattinson tries to stop a shot from Joe Root off his own bowling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"c7e3699016653e21a165cbc2105b9fae5e7da715\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7e3699016653e21a165cbc2105b9fae5e7da715/0_0_4674_3116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Warner celebrates taking the catch to dismiss Joe Root.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Warner celebrates taking the catch to dismiss Joe Root.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3806c6a3a5fdbec9c33f6262073aa501e83695e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3806c6a3a5fdbec9c33f6262073aa501e83695e6/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow lie in a heap after another dropped catch off the bowling of Ben Stokes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow lie in a heap after another dropped catch off the bowling of Ben Stokes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"26a72f128675f8b95ebcdbefdebe520e0d85e490\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26a72f128675f8b95ebcdbefdebe520e0d85e490/0_0_5188_3459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scoreboard showing England\u2019s miserable total.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scoreboard showing England\u2019s miserable total.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46038286a1b64924842dc054d085c607cb24cd81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46038286a1b64924842dc054d085c607cb24cd81/798_0_1676_2096/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Root after he was dismissed by Nathan Lyon during day four.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Root after he was dismissed by Nathan Lyon during day four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In their second innings, Australia scored 246 all out to give themselves a lead of 358, meaning England needed their highest ever successful run-chase in Test cricket.</p> <p>England reached day four of the Test on 156 for 3, giving themselves a ray of hope.

      "bodyText": "First Test: Edgbaston The first match of the series featured the return to Test cricket of the Australian trio Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft following suspensions for their respective parts in the ball-tampering scandal of 2018, aka \u201cSandpapergate\u201d. Needless to say, few England fans were willing to let bygones be bygones. Warner, one of the Australian openers, soon fell to a delivery by Stuart Broad \u2013 a recurring theme in the series \u2013 and copped an earful from the home fans as he departed. But what of Smith? The former Australian captain struck a superb 144, helping the tourists to recover from a disastrous 122-8 to eventually post 284 all out. In reply, England\u2019s Rory Burns scored 133 \u2013 his maiden Test century \u2013 as England made 374 all out. Edgbaston\u2019s Hollies Stand is recognised worldwide for its fancy dress and carnival atmosphere. Fans came in various guises including a group dressed as the England 1966 World Cup winners (replete with the Jules Rimet trophy) and a Donald Trump baby blimp. Many brought pieces of sandpaper to bate the Aussies. The second Australian innings saw another century for Smith \u2013 his 10th Ashes ton \u2013 and 110 for Matthew Wade. Australia declared on 487 for 7, leaving England chasing 398 to win. Australian bowlers Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyons were in inspired form when England returned to the crease, taking all 10 wickets for only 146 runs. England\u2019s misery in defeat was worsened by the news that their seam bowler James Anderson, who bowled only four overs in the Test, would miss the rest of the series with a calf injury. Second Test: Lord\u2019s The sight of Jofra Archer blitzing Smith in the second Test will live long in the memory; it echoed the infamous Bodyline series of 1932-33, which is still talked about today. Archer hit speeds in excess of 96mph and caught Smith twice in quick succession with bouncers in Australia\u2019s first innings. The first cracked Smith on the forearm; the second careered into the back of his neck and sent him sprawling to the floor. After a concussion assessment and a brief rest, Smith was allowed to carry on, but he was later forced to retire from the Test. Prior to that, the two sides had only traded metaphorical blows. After a washout on day one, Australia had won the toss and sent England \u2013 who wore red caps in support of the Ruth Strauss Foundation \u2013 in to bat. England made 258 all out. Warner fell in the fifth over of the visitors\u2019 reply \u2013 his third single-digit score of the series \u2013 bowled again by his nemesis Broad. Then Archer claimed his first Test wicket, dismissing Cameron Bancroft lbw. With Smith losing his wicket LBW to Chris Woakes only eight runs short of another century, Australia\u2019s tailenders tumbled before tea and the tourists finished with a total of 250. England\u2019s second innings saw Joe Root out for a golden duck to Cummins on day four, before rain brought proceedings to a premature end. A sprightly batting display from Ben Stokes, who bludgeoned 115 from 165 balls, allowed the hosts to declare on 258 for 5 in order to chase a late win. However, Labuschagne and Travis Head proved obstinate for Australia, putting on 85 runs for the fourth wicket. Ultimately, despite placing numerous fielders at close quarters in the dying light, England could not skittle Australia and the match was drawn. Third Test: Headingley Headingley 2019: the greatest Test match ever played? Discuss. For sheer drama and down-to-the-wire brilliance, the final day of the third Test will go down in legend; so too will its key protagonists. Ben Stokes and Jack Leach hauled England to an unthinkable victory with a show of great resilience \u2013 the latter earning himself a lifetime supply of Specsavers glasses to boot. But how did it ever come to that? For the second Test running, the start of play was delayed by rain. Australia collapsed to 179 all out in their first innings and Archer ended with figures of six for 45. However, England were woeful in reply: all out for only 67, it was their 12th lowest Test score of all time. Josh Hazlewood picked up a five-wicket haul for the visitors and England looked like they had thrown the Ashes away. In their second innings, Australia scored 246 all out to give themselves a lead of 358, meaning England needed their highest ever successful run-chase in Test cricket. England reached day four of the Test on 156 for 3, giving themselves a ray of hope. But Joe Root was then caught behind before Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Jofra Archer and Stuart Broad all departed in the space of 16 crippling overs. England had only one wicket remaining with 73 more runs needed for victory. It looked impossible. Jack Leach joined Ben Stokes in the middle and the two men created a partnership for the ages. Stokes reached his century with a masterful display of batting, while Leach, whose glasses frequently steamed up as the pressure mounted, was the perfect defensive foil. At times, Stokes was so nervous he was unable to watch his partner on strike. In the dying stages, when England needed just two runs, Nathan Lyon fumbled a brilliant chance to run out Leach who was miles from his crease. The next ball looked like a plumb lbw shout but Australia had burned all their reviews. Leach then scrambled a single off Pat Cummins before Stokes hammered through the covers to complete an astonishing victory. As delirious celebrations swept the ground, Leach planted a smacker on Stokes. England had not only saved the Ashes, they\u2019d given themselves a chance to go on and win it. Fourth Test: Old Traffford After the delirium of Leeds, England\u2019s performance at Old Trafford fell flat. The Aussies ran rampant in their first innings, racking up 497 for 8 before declaring. Steve Smith was once again the main architect of their innings, scoring 211 before being caught by Joe Denly off Joe Root. England narrowly avoided the follow-on when they posted 301 in reply \u2013 Stokes could only muster 26 in his first stint at the crease \u2013 but even the arrival of storm clouds couldn\u2019t alter the course of the Test. Smith top scored (again) in the second innings as Australia declared on 186 for six, setting England a run-chase of 383. When Burns fell for a duck and was instantly followed by Root \u2013 out first ball to a monstrous delivery by Pat Cummins \u2013 late on day four, England were 0 for 2. Jason Roy defended the hat-trick ball and survived until the close of play, but England\u2019s hopes were in tatters. A brief rally on day five gave Australia the jitters \u2013 Jos Buttler, Craig Overton and Jack Leach all provided solid resistance to Australia\u2019s otherwise inspired trio of Pat Cummins, Marnus Labuschagne and Josh Hazlewood. The latter eventually took Overton\u2019s wicket lbw to end the contest and ensure Australia retained the Ashes on English soil for the first time since 2001. Fifth Test: The Oval Only one thing remained to be settled in the fifth Test: could Australia win the Ashes series outright, or could England force a creditable draw? Remarkably, Australia\u2019s captain, Tim Paine, put England in to bat after winning the toss \u2013 one of his many questionable decisions in the series \u2013 allowing the home side to chalk up 294 in their first innings. Jos Buttler top scored with 70. In return, Warner fell cheaply again as Archer took six for 62. Woakes removed Smith lbw, but not before the Australian had plundered another 80 runs.

Do a search and you get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/12/michael-cohen-sentence-latest-news-trump-hush-money-payments-lying-charges\">Michael Cohen, the Trump fixer who went to jail</a>. Wrong one. Though this one did go to jail, too. He\u2019s French, born in 1953 on an estate in a poor suburb of Paris and his first job was to sell the Encyclopedia Britannica door-to-door, which he was very good at. </p> <p>Cohen later went to the US and started selling French pat\u00e9, then prints. He got into the art world, became a dealer, sold Picassos, Monets, Chagalls. For a while he lived the dream, drove fast cars, had a house in Malibu with his German wife and two kids, a chef, horses, everything. He got into the options market. That didn\u2019t go so well, so he got into debt. Cohen started to put loans and artworks that weren\u2019t his into the market; the hole got bigger and bigger. In the end he disappeared, having swindled the New York art world out of $50m.</p> <p>That was in 2001. Vanessa Engle, the documentary maker (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/19/the-funeral-murders-review-masterful-handling-of-a-combustible-narrative\">The Funeral Murders</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/27/the-cult-next-door-review-tracing-an-extraordinary-case-of-slavery-in-south-london\">The Cult Next Door</a>, Women, Jews, Lefties, loads of other brilliant stuff) was making arts documentaries at the time. She clocked the story as one to keep an eye on.</p> <p>And she did \u2026 for 17 years. \u201cNobody knew where he had gone; he had just vanished with his wife and kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it was an interesting story, but I didn\u2019t have a way in. The art world is very secretive, they don\u2019t like to talk, especially if they have just been ripped off to the tune of many millions. It\u2019s a world built on trust. Clients are not going to want to know a dealer of a gallery that could so easily be defrauded.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re in a north London pub, and Engle is telling me about her manhunt: the search for Cohen. \u201cI\u2019ve searched his name online every two or three months for 17 years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd0cd8bcc339f0ebf8d15ca9a0bb015166764350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd0cd8bcc339f0ebf8d15ca9a0bb015166764350/0_84_2021_2698/749.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He just vanished\u2019 ...

Cohen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Top Hat/Michel Cohen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first hit came in 2003: <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2003/LAW/05/07/art.fraud.charges/\">a small story in the US press</a>. Cohen had been arrested, by Interpol, in Rio de Janeiro; he was in jail in Brazil. \u201cI thought OK, now\u2019s my chance, maybe the Brazilian authorities will let me into the prison, I can get the whole story, it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d says Engle, reliving the excitement.</p> <p>She was on another project, but there was no hurry because he would be in prison for a long time. Then, later that year, she searched again and \u2026 he had escaped! The story just got better \u2013 Papillon meets The Goldfinch meets The Great Train Robbery. But it had also gone cold. \u201cI thought: oh, I\u2019ve missed it.\u201d</p> <p>The trail stayed cold for years, although Engle never forgot about Cohen. In 2017 she spoke to a commissioning editor at the BBC. She didn\u2019t think she would find him, didn\u2019t even know if he was alive, but she could talk to his friends, and people in the art world.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve often said I should have been a policeman because what we do is the same,\u201d she says. \u201cWe gather clues to put together a plausible story, and find witnesses who can testify to that story.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Engle argues she\u2019s not really the detective in this story. \u201cI\u2019m good at getting people on board, mapping the story, but if it was not for Billie \u2026\u201d Billie is Billie Shepherd, the producer Engle hired because she worked on Who Do You Think You Are? and knows how to find people. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fall out with Billie,\u201d says Engle. \u201cShe will track you down.\u201d</p> <p>They made a timeline of transactions, paintings, swindles and people; it ran to more than 100 pages. They called in legal documents from the US and Brazil, sometimes getting people to go to court and photocopy them.</p> <p>Once they had names and addresses, they made a big drawing: Cohen in the middle, then his inner circle of family and close friends (people such as Richard Roy, who plays a big part in the film), followed by an outer circle of those he had done business with or ripped off.</p> <p>Then Engle wrote letters to them. She had heard rumours there were people who wanted to have Cohen assassinated. \u201cThere are people in the art world who have mafia connections, laundering money,\u201d says Engle. \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite a dirty business. In the end, I was convinced there are people who would know where to get a hitman.\u201d Or he might just be dead; he would be in his mid-60s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ea03e723e7a4e977155877b9ca3f684209770cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ea03e723e7a4e977155877b9ca3f684209770cb/0_175_4032_2753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vanessa Engle: \u2018I should have been a policeman.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanessa Engle: \u2018I should have been a policeman.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johann Perry/BBC/Top Hat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She concentrated on the outer circle first, fearful that someone near Cohen would tip him off and cause him to run. They got some hits: old acquaintances who agreed to talk, dealers, just about enough to make a film. \u201cThen we thought, we\u2019ve got nothing to lose, and pressed go on that last lot of letters, including ones we hoped might get to his family and \u2013 maybe \u2013 him.\u201d</p> <p>Engle waited. There was no response from Cohen\u2019s sister, but they got Roy, Cohen\u2019s friend and business partner, who had gone to the US with him and set up the pat\u00e9 business. \u201cWhen we got him, me and Billie were just screaming,\u201d says Engle.</p> <p>Then, one day, Engle was at home when the phone rang. \u201cThis woman said: \u2018My name is blablabla\u2019 [she doesn\u2019t want me to know the woman\u2019s name]. I was distracted, I didn\u2019t know if it was the wrong number, or someone asking if I was satisfied with my gas supply,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI can be slightly brusque, so I said: \u2018Sorry, who is this?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It was Cohen\u2019s wife, who had also gone to Brazil with the two kids, had a third there, then had a really tough time after he was arrested. She was going to be able to fill in the missing pieces, perhaps even lead Engle to the man himself.</p> <p>Cohen\u2019s wife was very nervous. She said she couldn\u2019t really talk on the phone, didn\u2019t say anything about where Cohen was or whether he was still alive, but did agree to meet in a cafe. Not in London, but a different country \u2013 and Engle was to come alone. The BBC weren\u2019t happy about that, so a colleague went as well, pretending not to be there, tracking Engle\u2019s phone.</p> <p>Mrs Cohen, it turns out, was \u201clovely, sweet and warm\u201d. She talked for hours. Now, would she do it on camera? Absolutely not. Uh oh. It is a shame, but not the end of the world, because ... well, it\u2019s in the film.</p> <p>Which is fabulous; a stonkingly good romp. Not a million miles away from the Netflix <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/14/fyre-netflix-documentary-festival-disaster-review\">Fyre festival</a> documentary, but with more personality, motifs and metaphors running through it. \u201cAnd we got the guy!\u201d says Engle. \u201cThere has been a whole spate of these films where you have a central protagonist who\u2019s done something really wrong, but it\u2019s very rare to get the guy.\u201d</p> <p>Oops, spoiler alert. Actually, not such a spoiler: he\u2019s there, right at the beginning of the film. He was there in that cafe, too. \u201cA small man shuffled up to the table, unshaven, his hair was quite long, wearing a scruffy sweatshirt,\u201d says Engle. \u201cI thought: is that the guy I\u2019ve been looking for for 17 years?\u201d And it was.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The $50m Art Swindle is on BBC Two on 23 September 2019 at 9pm.</em></p>",

Cohen later went to the US and started selling French pat\u00e9, then prints. He got into the art world, became a dealer, sold Picassos, Monets, Chagalls. For a while he lived the dream, drove fast cars, had a house in Malibu with his German wife and two kids, a chef, horses, everything. He got into the options market. That didn\u2019t go so well, so he got into debt. Cohen started to put loans and artworks that weren\u2019t his into the market; the hole got bigger and bigger. In the end he disappeared, having swindled the New York art world out of $50m. That was in 2001. Vanessa Engle, the documentary maker (The Funeral Murders, The Cult Next Door, Women, Jews, Lefties, loads of other brilliant stuff) was making arts documentaries at the time. She clocked the story as one to keep an eye on. And she did \u2026 for 17 years. \u201cNobody knew where he had gone; he had just vanished with his wife and kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it was an interesting story, but I didn\u2019t have a way in. The art world is very secretive, they don\u2019t like to talk, especially if they have just been ripped off to the tune of many millions. It\u2019s a world built on trust. Clients are not going to want to know a dealer of a gallery that could so easily be defrauded.\u201d We\u2019re in a north London pub, and Engle is telling me about her manhunt: the search for Cohen. \u201cI\u2019ve searched his name online every two or three months for 17 years.\u201d The first hit came in 2003: a small story in the US press. Cohen had been arrested, by Interpol, in Rio de Janeiro; he was in jail in Brazil. \u201cI thought OK, now\u2019s my chance, maybe the Brazilian authorities will let me into the prison, I can get the whole story, it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d says Engle, reliving the excitement. She was on another project, but there was no hurry because he would be in prison for a long time. Then, later that year, she searched again and \u2026 he had escaped! The story just got better \u2013 Papillon meets The Goldfinch meets The Great Train Robbery. But it had also gone cold. \u201cI thought: oh, I\u2019ve missed it.\u201d The trail stayed cold for years, although Engle never forgot about Cohen. In 2017 she spoke to a commissioning editor at the BBC. She didn\u2019t think she would find him, didn\u2019t even know if he was alive, but she could talk to his friends, and people in the art world. \u201cI\u2019ve often said I should have been a policeman because what we do is the same,\u201d she says. \u201cWe gather clues to put together a plausible story, and find witnesses who can testify to that story.\u201d Yet Engle argues she\u2019s not really the detective in this story. \u201cI\u2019m good at getting people on board, mapping the story, but if it was not for Billie \u2026\u201d Billie is Billie Shepherd, the producer Engle hired because she worked on Who Do You Think You Are? and knows how to find people. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fall out with Billie,\u201d says Engle. \u201cShe will track you down.\u201d They made a timeline of transactions, paintings, swindles and people; it ran to more than 100 pages. They called in legal documents from the US and Brazil, sometimes getting people to go to court and photocopy them. Once they had names and addresses, they made a big drawing: Cohen in the middle, then his inner circle of family and close friends (people such as Richard Roy, who plays a big part in the film), followed by an outer circle of those he had done business with or ripped off. Then Engle wrote letters to them. She had heard rumours there were people who wanted to have Cohen assassinated. \u201cThere are people in the art world who have mafia connections, laundering money,\u201d says Engle. \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite a dirty business. In the end, I was convinced there are people who would know where to get a hitman.\u201d Or he might just be dead; he would be in his mid-60s. She concentrated on the outer circle first, fearful that someone near Cohen would tip him off and cause him to run. They got some hits: old acquaintances who agreed to talk, dealers, just about enough to make a film. \u201cThen we thought, we\u2019ve got nothing to lose, and pressed go on that last lot of letters, including ones we hoped might get to his family and \u2013 maybe \u2013 him.\u201d Engle waited. There was no response from Cohen\u2019s sister, but they got Roy, Cohen\u2019s friend and business partner, who had gone to the US with him and set up the pat\u00e9 business. \u201cWhen we got him, me and Billie were just screaming,\u201d says Engle. Then, one day, Engle was at home when the phone rang. \u201cThis woman said: \u2018My name is blablabla\u2019 [she doesn\u2019t want me to know the woman\u2019s name]. I was distracted, I didn\u2019t know if it was the wrong number, or someone asking if I was satisfied with my gas supply,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI can be slightly brusque, so I said: \u2018Sorry, who is this?\u2019\u201d It was Cohen\u2019s wife, who had also gone to Brazil with the two kids, had a third there, then had a really tough time after he was arrested. She was going to be able to fill in the missing pieces, perhaps even lead Engle to the man himself. Cohen\u2019s wife was very nervous. She said she couldn\u2019t really talk on the phone, didn\u2019t say anything about where Cohen was or whether he was still alive, but did agree to meet in a cafe. Not in London, but a different country \u2013 and Engle was to come alone. The BBC weren\u2019t happy about that, so a colleague went as well, pretending not to be there, tracking Engle\u2019s phone. Mrs Cohen, it turns out, was \u201clovely, sweet and warm\u201d. She talked for hours. Now, would she do it on camera? Absolutely not. Uh oh. It is a shame, but not the end of the world, because ... well, it\u2019s in the film. Which is fabulous; a stonkingly good romp. Not a million miles away from the Netflix Fyre festival documentary, but with more personality, motifs and metaphors running through it. \u201cAnd we got the guy!\u201d says Engle. \u201cThere has been a whole spate of these films where you have a central protagonist who\u2019s done something really wrong, but it\u2019s very rare to get the guy.\u201d Oops, spoiler alert. Actually, not such a spoiler: he\u2019s there, right at the beginning of the film. He was there in that cafe, too. \u201cA small man shuffled up to the table, unshaven, his hair was quite long, wearing a scruffy sweatshirt,\u201d says Engle. \u201cI thought: is that the guy I\u2019ve been looking for for 17 years?\u201d And it was. \u2022 The $50m Art Swindle is on BBC Two on 23 September 2019 at 9pm.",

With CVC, previously involved in Formula One, having already bought into the Gallagher Premiership and looking to tie up a further partnership deal with the Guinness Pro14, the prospect of radical alterations to the existing international and club structure is steadily increasing, potentially undermining World Rugby\u2019s authority as the sport\u2019s governing body. \u201cSomeone who is as big an investor in the sport as a private equity firm like CVC will create influence. That is something that in some areas could concern us,\u201d said Brett Gosper, World Rugby\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhen you have a high-funding commercial owner of the sport that isn\u2019t the governing body then certain calls can be made which we might think aren\u2019t in the interests of the sport\u2019s growth, player welfare or other areas. We would want to make sure things are being done for the right reasons and that our influence wasn\u2019t usurped.\u201d World Rugby will now be pressing for further details, having previously failed to reach their own agreement with CVC to back their rejected World League proposal, which would have involved the world\u2019s leading 10 nations playing against each other to create more interest in non-World Cup years. \u201cThe Six Nations have decided to take another route but I\u2019d have to say we don\u2019t know enough about the ins and outs of that deal,\u201d said Gosper. \u201cWe can\u2019t really comment at this stage whether it\u2019s good or bad. But many of our biggest members have welcomed this increased funding and so we can only recognise it as a positive. We just have a couple of concerns and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have a chance to discuss those with CVC and the Six Nations. \u201cGiven the recent positions CVC have taken in the game it would be madness for us not to be in some sort of communication with them. We all want a healthy, growing sport.\u201d",

It did not go well.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s weekly Brexit briefing. If you\u2019d like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our latest Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here, and for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories Plot twists galore, but \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 nothing you might describe as actual progress. A Scottish appeal court ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful \u2013 but did not order MPs to return. The government was forced to release its secret Operation Yellowhammer \u201cplanning assumptions\u201d for a no-deal Brexit, which warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder on Britain\u2019s streets. Johnson continued to insist \u201chuge progress\u201d was being made \u2013 although No 10 played down hopes of a breakthrough involving an all-Ireland regulatory regime for food and agriculture which it thinks could help replace the backstop, and Michel Barnier said there were \u201cno grounds\u201d for formally re-opening talks. Increasingly alarmed at the possibility that the PM might try to break the law by forcing a no deal, however, a cross-party group of MPs looked at bringing back a version of Theresa May\u2019s deal, plus a vote on a second referendum, in late October. And the outgoing Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, warned that he was prepared to rip up the parliamentary rulebook to stop any illegal attempt by the prime minister to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Johnson did, at least, meet the outgoing president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. It did not go well. Before heading to Luxembourg, the PM compared himself to the Incredible Hulk, throwing off the shackles of the EU. Despite EU officials repeatedly insisting they had seen no concrete British proposals whatsoever on alternatives to the backstop, the foreign secretary, Domic Raab, said the bloc had heard enough and was indulging in \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d. Johnson told Juncker the UK would not ask for a further Brexit extension and would not accept one if the EU offered it \u2013 nor would it request any extension to the EU transition period beyond December 2020 if he got a Brexit deal. Unfortunately, the PM was then humiliated by his Luxembourg counterpart, Xavier Bettel, who went ahead with a planned joint press conference that Johnson dodged because of protesters \u2013 and savaged Johnson\u2019s Brexit approach. All eyes, meanwhile, are on 11 supreme court judges who this week will hear the politically charged claim that the PM acted unlawfully in advising the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks in order to stifle debate over the Brexit crisis. Some people worry that if the government wins, Johnson may even decide to suspend parliament for a second time when it returns on 14 October. What next Who knows? But four main scenarios seem to present themselves: Unlikely as it may seem, Johnson could still get a deal, probably based around a border in the Irish sea. He would find getting it through parliament very hard, but perhaps not impossible, helped maybe by Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies. He could decide to break his promise, request an extension and then immediately demand an election, counting on a fiercely anti-EU, people-versus-parliament campaign to see him through. He could, theoretically at least, go for no deal on 31 October, testing or even ignoring the law. Early elections would follow, with the PM trusting that with Brexit delivered, the Brexit party would be no more \u2013 and that no deal would not be too catastrophic. Or he could resign or be pushed out. Rather than the divisive Jeremy Corbyn, a more neutral figure (Ken Clarke?) might then head up a temporary government whose sole purpose would be to ask the EU for an extension, with elections to follow. Best of the rest EU citizens feel safer in Scotland than in England, report says. David Cameron: Johnson said leave campaign would lose minutes before backing it. Brexit uncertainty triggers first September fall in house prices since 2010. Britain is facing its most prolonged investment slump in 17 years. Only half of UK universities are ready for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 study. Labour members to push for anti-Brexit stance at conference. Five things we learned from David Cameron\u2019s memoir. Nicky Morgan says she would vote to remain in the EU in a second referendum. Hopes of a clean break with the EU are nonsense, says ex-Brexit official. Criminal gangs will cash in on no-deal Brexit, police warn. MPs condemn \u2018misleading\u2019 no-deal Brexit publicity campaign. Anti-Brexiters file new legal challenge to force article 50 extension. Retailers: fruit, vegetables and wine will be scarce and costly under no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson says it is \u2018absolutely\u2019 not true he misled Queen over prorogation. Lib Dems pledge to revoke Brexit without referendum. Top comment In the Guardian, Matthew d\u2019Ancona says Boris Johnson\u2019s invocation of the Incredible Hulk was apt \u2013 his behaviour is monstrous: During the leadership contest, Johnson said that the chances of no deal were a \u201cmillion to one against\u201d. Last month he said it was \u201ctouch and go\u201d. Now, in advance of his meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, he claims that \u201cwe will get there\u201d. Which Johnson to believe? Frankly, all this briefing about \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d and diplomatic \u201cmovement\u201d strikes me as mere preparatory work for the attribution of blame as 31 October approaches. Imagine Johnson and his acolytes raging as the deadline gets near, and how they will complain that the prime minister\u2019s superhuman efforts have been undermined \u2013 by Brussels, by remainiacs, by disloyal Tories, by judges, by Larry the cat. It will all be someone else\u2019s fault. That, at least, is what they will say. But don\u2019t believe a word of it. Inside the Hulk, there is and has always been a small and fearful man, wondering, with good reason, what will become of him when he loses all his strength.

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Nato chief urges calm as Iran blamed for Saudi oil facility blasts Donald Trump has said the US response to an attack on the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia will depend on the assessment of the Saudi regime in Riyadh, even as the US secretaries of state and energy explicitly blamed Iran. Unnamed American officials were quoted in US media outlets claiming Iranian cruise missiles were used in the strike, which was aimed at the heart of the Saudi economy. But Iran denies involvement in the attack, for which Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebel group has claimed responsibility. Oil supply. The attacks on Saturday sent oil prices skyrocketing and severely disrupted global energy infrastructure, but Trump played down concerns over US reliance on Middle Eastern oil, pointing out that the US is now the world\u2019s top energy producer. Escalating crisis. Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Monday that he was \u201cextremely concerned about a risk of escalation\u201d in the region, where tensions between Iran, Saudi Arabia and their proxies are rising towards conflict. New York prosecutors subpoena Trump\u2019s tax returns The office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, has subpoenaed eight years of Trump\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns as part of its investigation of hush money payments to the porn actor Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election, according to media reports. The subpoena represents a fresh attempt at forcing the president into financial transparency. Mazars USA, which prepares Trump\u2019s tax returns, said in a statement that it would \u201cfully comply with its legal obligations\u201d. \u2018Constitutional immunity.\u2019 The White House has directed two former Trump aides, Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter, not to appear at a House judiciary committee hearing on Tuesday. Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, who never worked for the White House, is expected to testify. Israelis head to the polls for second election this year Israelis began voting on Tuesday morning in the country\u2019s second election in less than six months, with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, seeking a stable parliamentary coalition to implement his ultranationalist agenda. Facing the prospect of criminal corruption indictments, Netanyahu has fought the campaign by demonising the country\u2019s Arab minority and vowing to double down on his far-right policies, by declaring up to a third of the occupied Palestinian territories as part of Israel if he is re-elected. Palestinian despair. Whether Netanyahu wins or not, the future remains bleak for Palestinians, says Raja Shehadeh, a Palestinian lawyer and writer. None of the parties are talking about the occupation, or proposing how to end it. Instead they are competing to promise the most to Israeli settlers. GM workers strike to fight \u2018management greed\u2019 More than 49,000 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union have gone out on strike for the first time in over a decade, as negotiations with General Motors management over job security and better wages stalled. Over the last two and a half years, GM made profits of more than $25bn as CEO Mary Berra earned a salary 281 times greater than the median GM worker. Meanwhile, the firm shed 22,000 jobs worldwide last year, with thousands more still at risk. Necessary \u2018sacrifice\u2019. If the strike drags on, workers could soon be earning just $250 per week. But picketers who spoke to the Guardian said they were willing to make that \u201csacrifice\u201d in the wider battle against management\u2019s \u201cflat-out greed\u201d. Cheat sheet The rampant deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon is being driven in large part by criminal networks, who threaten and attack officials, indigenous people and environmental activists, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch. Aid workers have warned of a potential humanitarian catastrophe within Europe\u2019s borders, as conditions deteriorate for the more than 24,000 refugees being held in vastly overcrowded camps on Greece\u2019s Aegean islands. Iceland\u2019s prime minister is to host the first major international conference exploring the #MeToo movement in Reykjavik on Tuesday. Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir told the Guardian she hoped the event would contribute to \u201crelegating sexual harassment to history\u201d. An 87-year-old Holocaust survivor who was facing eviction in Alameda, California, will be allowed to remain in his longtime home, after a Guardian report on his case prompted widespread anger and a bolstering of the state\u2019s tenant protections. Must-reads The 25 best artworks of the 21st century Today in the Guardian\u2019s roundup of the century\u2019s greatest culture, our art critics compile their list of the 25 best artworks since 2000 \u2013 and Alex Needham talks to the creator of their number one pick, who admits: \u201cNobody thinks lists like this matter \u2013 unless you\u2019re on them.\u201d How the Trump administration tried to bury climate science From weakening vehicle emissions to blocking warnings about the impact on the Arctic, six whistleblowers and ex-government scientists tell Oliver Milman how they were directed to ignore or deny climate science by the Trump administration \u2013 and explain why they won\u2019t be silenced. Can a woke makeover win Barbie new fans? Hasbro is launching Ms Monopoly, a new version of the classic boardgame in which women will make more than men. Barbie has a new line of Inspiring Women dolls. Are they empowering and inclusive, asks Andr\u00e9 Wheeler, or just \u201cwoke-washing\u201d for profit? Unbelievable: the quiet power of Netflix\u2019s rape drama Netflix\u2019s latest true crime series focuses on two police investigations of the same serial rapist: one goes awry, the other is dogged and empathic. It is an object lesson in the effective investigation of serious sexual assault, says Adrian Horton \u2013 and a warning against the potential pitfalls. Opinion Purdue Pharma has filed for bankruptcy. Its owners the Sackler family have pledged billions to victims of the opioids crisis their painkiller OxyContin did so much to fuel.

Anyone who stood in the way was depriving suffering Americans of the help they need, they claimed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/01/america-opioids-catastrophe-has-lessons-for-us-all-greed-racial-division\">America\u2019s opioid catastrophe has lessons for us all, about greed and racial division | Kenan Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/26/sacklers-opioids-purdue-pharma-oxycontin-opioids\">Members of the Sackler family</a> who own Purdue have offered to turn over the company to a trust which would funnel future earnings to treatment and other measures to deal with the tragedy. They would also sell Mundipharma, a British-based sister company, and hand over the payment. The Sacklers even said they would give up a part of the huge profits of OxyContin, which made the family multibillionaires.</p> <p>Some of the state attorneys general and cities suing Purdue have accepted the deal as the best prospect for getting anything out of the company and said the bankruptcy filing was part of the arrangement.</p> <p>Other attorneys general rejected the move, claiming it was an attempt by Purdue\u2019s owners and executives to hang on to the bulk of the profits of drug dealing and buy their way out of individual accountability.

      "bodyText": "If only we could feel Purdue Pharma\u2019s pain. The directors and owners of the company that did so much to create America\u2019s opioid epidemic are professing distress and bewilderment at the rejection of what they claim are its good faith efforts to help the victims. Even as Purdue announced plans late Sunday night to file for bankruptcy, its top officials were making unctuous claims that their concern was to combat an epidemic that has claimed more than 400,000 lives. Anyone who stood in the way was depriving suffering Americans of the help they need, they claimed. Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue have offered to turn over the company to a trust which would funnel future earnings to treatment and other measures to deal with the tragedy. They would also sell Mundipharma, a British-based sister company, and hand over the payment. The Sacklers even said they would give up a part of the huge profits of OxyContin, which made the family multibillionaires. Some of the state attorneys general and cities suing Purdue have accepted the deal as the best prospect for getting anything out of the company and said the bankruptcy filing was part of the arrangement. Other attorneys general rejected the move, claiming it was an attempt by Purdue\u2019s owners and executives to hang on to the bulk of the profits of drug dealing and buy their way out of individual accountability. Some of those states are also suing the Sacklers directly. Whether or not the deal is right for individual states, no one should be fooled by Purdue\u2019s attempts to pretend it is putting the welfare of the victims of its crimes to the fore. Purdue\u2019s response has been to lament that continued legal actions will drain resources from millions of people whose lives have been wrecked by opioid addiction, whether it is those hooked on drugs or their families who have to live with the consequences. \u201cThis settlement framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation, and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis,\u201d said Steve Miller, the chair of Purdue\u2019s board of directors.

      "body": "<p>The 60s had miniskirts, the 70s had flares, the 80s had shoulderpads. Every decade has a look. True, in each case this is an appalling oversimplification. Flares did not rule the whole of the 70s, for instance: by the summer of 1978, Sandy was rocking wet-look drainpipes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/18/grease-review-john-travolta-olivia-newton-john\" title=\"\">Grease</a>. So to put your head above the parapet and attempt to skewer the look of the decade before that decade is even over is, clearly, madness.</p> <p>But I\u2019m going to do it anyway, so here goes. For a certain type of woman in the decade that is now drawing to a close, the unspoken style ideal was to look like you worked in the art world. This involved interesting neutrals (mostly navy for the first half of the decade, grey and beige the second) with sophisticated, painterly accent colours such as mustard or fuchsia. It meant a sihouette that was de-centred, abstracted from the shape of the body below. It called for unfussy pieces with intriguing details: a simple dress with a statement sleeve, for instance. There was little skin on show: there were a lot of funnel necks, then polos, and skirts were below the knee for most of the decade. There were elements of menswear \u2013 blazers, tailored trousers, unisex white trainers or Gucci loafers \u2013 but these were mixed with feminine silk blouses rather than styled in a performatively androgynous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/annie-hall\" title=\"\">Annie Hall</a> kind of way. For evening, tight black dresses languished unworn in favour of elevated, accessorised versions of the daywear look, or bold dresses with a certain flamboyance of colour or print or silhouette.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bfb407056ddf4d21165dae4a826c195c2cb0430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bfb407056ddf4d21165dae4a826c195c2cb0430/0_376_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A visitor to the Frieze art fair in 2016 looks around the Hans op de Beeck installation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A visitor to the Frieze art fair in 2016 looks around the Hans op de Beeck installation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An observer noticing this woman as she crossed the road on her way to work \u2013 she probably had earphones in to listen to a podcast, this decade, rather than being on the phone \u2013 would have clocked her interestingly textured funnel-neck sweater, French-tucked behind the fly button of wide-legged trousers which in turn were cropped to show, perhaps, a flash of white ankle boot. This observer might have imagined her headed to a job in a private gallery, perhaps. She wasn\u2019t power-dressed in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/17/working-girl-at-30-the-workplace-comedy-that-changed-the-game\" title=\"\">Working Girl</a> kind of way, but neither was she tricked out and dolled up in a ladies-who-lunch kind of way. She had a job, she had purpose and discipline, but she wasn\u2019t part of the machine.</p> <p>I say she, but of course I\u2019m really talking about me, and I\u2019m very likely talking about you, too. A couple of years ago, I was telling a friend about a loose, sweeping <a href=\"https://www.valentino.com/en-gb/\" title=\"\">Valentino</a> dress in dark, wanton florals I\u2019d fallen in love with and wanted to buy for a birthday party. I was trying to explain what was so fabulous about it, and why I so desperately wanted it despite being able to neither afford nor justify the price tag. \u201cIt\u2019s very\u2026 ceramicist with a private income,\u201d was the phrase that came out of my mouth, as I reached for a definition. She knew exactly what I meant. And she immediately agreed with me that I needed the dress.</p> <p>How did \u201cceramicist with a private income\u201d become a cipher for glamour? How did \u201cen route to install an exhibition\u201d come to be a more aspirational vibe than \u201cmani-pedi appointment followed by lunch at Daphne\u2019s\u201d? Well, for a start, this decade has seen the art world expand and transform, from a prestigious but niche industry into a pop culture arena of big money, glamorous travel, blue chip status and boundless individuality. In 2000 there were 55 art fairs around the world; in 2018 there were 260. (In London, the weeks of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/friezeartfair\" title=\"\">Frieze art fair</a> surpass pre-Christmas as the busiest time of year at department store <a href=\"https://london.doverstreetmarket.com/\" title=\"\">Dover Street Market</a>.) Fashion and art have not been so close since the days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/29/schiaparelli-first-ready-to-wear-collection\" title=\"\">Elsa Schiaparelli</a> and Salvador <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/dali\" title=\"\">Dal\u00ed</a>.

Art has snowballed in cultural value as exponentially as its cash stock has risen. As our culture has become ever more visual \u2013 Instagram is the pop radio of our times \u2013 the status of art, which stands at the apex of our aesthetics, has soared. What\u2019s more, the mood music of the art world is perfect for now. Authenticity, a buzzword of this decade, is rooted in art. Individuality and creativity are honoured in art. And don\u2019t get me started on the word \u201ccurate\u201d, which 10 years ago was an activity specific to museums and galleries but has become the verb du jour, applied to arranging your wardrobe, or laying the table for supper.</p> <p>Art world chic stalked the runways this season. At <a href=\"https://www.bottegaveneta.com/gb\" title=\"\">Bottega Veneta</a>, the elegant but just-slightly-off proportions \u2013 a scoop-neck cream crop sweater with a gold chain trim, worn with the softest leather trousers \u2013 had fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/phoebe-philo\" title=\"\">Phoebe Philo</a>\u2019s era at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/celine\" title=\"\">Celine</a> swooning. At <a href=\"https://www.loewe.com/eur/en/home\" title=\"\">Loewe</a>, the chic understatement of a navy silk gown with a boxy, vest-like cut was catnip to an artfully-aligned audience. At <a href=\"https://www.jacquemus.com/?v=79cba1185463\" title=\"\">Jacquemus</a>, a sculptural camisole half-tucked into crisp tailored trousers had that insider wink of refined chic. Nothing obviously splashy to see here; but to the trained eye, this is perfection nonetheless.</p> <p>A close alignment with the art world has been a key element in how <a href=\"https://www.matchesfashion.com/womens\" title=\"\">matchesfashion.com</a> has evolved into a uniquely sophisticated multibrand retailer. Natalie Kingham, fashion and buying director, has long held a chic curator in mind as an imaginary muse. Throughout 2019, the site has partnered with Frieze, hosting salons and pop-ups in tandem as the art fair travels around the world\u2019s most fashionable cities. This is not just about selling dresses to wealthy art collectors, or about using art as inspiration for your look, but about life imitating art \u2013 specifically, the most fashionable life imitating an art-world kind of life. The matchesfashion.com townhouse at <a href=\"https://www.matchesfashion.com/5carlosplace\" title=\"\">5 Carlos Place</a> in London is designed to feel \u201clike the ultimate collector\u2019s house, where we can host and entertain you, have original conversations and create memorable experiences,\u201d says Jess Christie, chief brand officer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1658ee10f6a24221ce3727aa6f4b176d1392cc90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1658ee10f6a24221ce3727aa6f4b176d1392cc90/0_11_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A visitor to Frieze in New York, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A visitor to Frieze in New York, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Zuchnik/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The look crosses all income brackets. <a href=\"https://www.cosstores.com/en_gbp/index.html\" title=\"\">Cos</a> is as central a pillar of this aesthetic as Phoebe Philo\u2019s Celine ever was. \u201cArt is ahead of fashion,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/20/cos-creative-director-karin-gustafsson\" title=\"\">Cos creative director Karin Gustafsson</a>. \u201cArtists reflect their surroundings, and so art tells us where the world is going.\u201d The label on the inside can be an important badge \u2013 old Celine, as designed by Phoebe Philo, was certainly something of an old-school tie for the art sorority \u2013 but the surface is less about logo than texture and quality, and the more elevated high street brands have worked hard at securing loyalty from this customer. \u201cThe quality, the weight, the feel of fabric are extremely important,\u201d says Hannah Gruy, who handles artist liaison at <a href=\"https://whitecube.com/\" title=\"\">White Cube</a> gallery and whose chic wardrobe saw her featured in a 2012 New York Times article about disciples of Philo, \u201cbut that\u2019s not just Celine or <a href=\"https://www.therow.com/gb/shop/women/ready-to-wear?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkZOdgtKR5AIVWoXVCh078w5HEAAYASAAEgKZmvD_BwE&amp;tp=187455\" title=\"\">The Row</a>.\u201d And while an \u201carty\u201d slant on chic was once the province of women of a certain age, it has spread to a younger demographic. \u201cWe have always done this look,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.toa.st/uk/about-us.htm\" title=\"\">Toast</a> designer Suzie de Rohan Willner of the brand\u2019s aesthetic, which she characterises as \u201ca mix of workwear, traditional craft and contemporary silhouette\u2026 It works at any age, but I am seeing more younger customers.\u201d</p> <p>A look that is, by definition, highly sophisticated is hard to pin down. Often the stamp of authenticity is in the detail, in nuances of thought process, which are a dog whistle to only a certain audience.

It\u2019s not about a division between the career woman and the stay-at-home mum. Working doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you are at the same office all week, so our clothes are about flexibility, and curating a wardrobe.\u201d</p> <p>For Gruy, \u201cmy work and non-work wardrobes are pretty blended. Flat shoes are essential, because at art fairs you are on your feet all day. And if I go to an event after work that\u2019s more often than not spontaneous, so I rely on red lipstick.\u201d At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/venice-biennale\" title=\"\">Venice Biennale</a>, Amfitheatrof regularly walks 20km in a day. \u201cYou are on a boat, off a boat, so you need flat shoes and you need a jacket,\u201d she says firmly. In a decade in which female empowerment has been a narrative of both fashion and art, \u201cwomen in the art world are finding their voice\u201d, Amfitheatrof says, \u201cand there is a sense of not dressing for men. This is not a world where you have your cleavage on show.\u201d</p> <p>Again, principle and practicality overlap. \u201cI like nice clothes, but I don\u2019t prioritise getting dolled up,\u201d Morgan shrugs. \u201cI just don\u2019t see that as an important enough way to be spending my time.\u201d</p> <p>Philo\u2019s departure from Celine last year left something of a power vacuum here. \u201cThere has definitely been a period of mourning for Phoebe,\u201d Amfitheatrof says. \u201cShe\u2019s not easy to replace because she always thought laterally, and she had such a singular point of view.\u201d In the post-Philo era, the art-oriented look has continued its trajectory toward being cleaner and crisper than the floatiness with which bohemian dressing was once associated. The magnetic pull of Scandinavian style and design can be seen here, just as it can in the architecture and interior design choices of the same tastemakers, who over the past decade have ditched colourful shabby chic for pale wood and clean lines.</p> <p>Utility is becoming a buzzword in fashion, with jumpsuits that look ever closer to overalls, and apron and pinafore styling on dresses. At Toast, a key piece for this autumn is \u201ca French jacket in workwear blue, with Japanese styling. The timelessness of those designs feels subversive,\u201d de Rohan Willner says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"465f28e53e62763bca42580752445fda1827136f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/465f28e53e62763bca42580752445fda1827136f/0_76_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phoebe Philo\u2019s Celine was \u2018an old-school tie for the art sorority\u2019 \u2026 she is pictured here at Paris fashion week after the spring/summer 2016 show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phoebe Philo\u2019s Celine was \u2018an old-school tie for the art sorority\u2019 \u2026 she is pictured here at Paris fashion week after the spring/summer 2016 show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In art and in fashion, beauty is prized. \u201cI want a sense of ease in a dress, but I also want it to make you look beautiful,\u201d de Rohan Willner adds. \u201cI care about the fabric but I also want the collarbone to be enhanced by the neckline, for instance.\u201d A high-profile art moment like the Venice Biennale, Amfitheatrof says, is \u201cnot an easy pack.

      "bodyText": "The 60s had miniskirts, the 70s had flares, the 80s had shoulderpads. Every decade has a look. True, in each case this is an appalling oversimplification. Flares did not rule the whole of the 70s, for instance: by the summer of 1978, Sandy was rocking wet-look drainpipes in Grease. So to put your head above the parapet and attempt to skewer the look of the decade before that decade is even over is, clearly, madness. But I\u2019m going to do it anyway, so here goes. For a certain type of woman in the decade that is now drawing to a close, the unspoken style ideal was to look like you worked in the art world. This involved interesting neutrals (mostly navy for the first half of the decade, grey and beige the second) with sophisticated, painterly accent colours such as mustard or fuchsia. It meant a sihouette that was de-centred, abstracted from the shape of the body below. It called for unfussy pieces with intriguing details: a simple dress with a statement sleeve, for instance. There was little skin on show: there were a lot of funnel necks, then polos, and skirts were below the knee for most of the decade. There were elements of menswear \u2013 blazers, tailored trousers, unisex white trainers or Gucci loafers \u2013 but these were mixed with feminine silk blouses rather than styled in a performatively androgynous Annie Hall kind of way. For evening, tight black dresses languished unworn in favour of elevated, accessorised versions of the daywear look, or bold dresses with a certain flamboyance of colour or print or silhouette. An observer noticing this woman as she crossed the road on her way to work \u2013 she probably had earphones in to listen to a podcast, this decade, rather than being on the phone \u2013 would have clocked her interestingly textured funnel-neck sweater, French-tucked behind the fly button of wide-legged trousers which in turn were cropped to show, perhaps, a flash of white ankle boot. This observer might have imagined her headed to a job in a private gallery, perhaps. She wasn\u2019t power-dressed in a Working Girl kind of way, but neither was she tricked out and dolled up in a ladies-who-lunch kind of way. She had a job, she had purpose and discipline, but she wasn\u2019t part of the machine. I say she, but of course I\u2019m really talking about me, and I\u2019m very likely talking about you, too. A couple of years ago, I was telling a friend about a loose, sweeping Valentino dress in dark, wanton florals I\u2019d fallen in love with and wanted to buy for a birthday party. I was trying to explain what was so fabulous about it, and why I so desperately wanted it despite being able to neither afford nor justify the price tag. \u201cIt\u2019s very\u2026 ceramicist with a private income,\u201d was the phrase that came out of my mouth, as I reached for a definition. She knew exactly what I meant. And she immediately agreed with me that I needed the dress. How did \u201cceramicist with a private income\u201d become a cipher for glamour? How did \u201cen route to install an exhibition\u201d come to be a more aspirational vibe than \u201cmani-pedi appointment followed by lunch at Daphne\u2019s\u201d? Well, for a start, this decade has seen the art world expand and transform, from a prestigious but niche industry into a pop culture arena of big money, glamorous travel, blue chip status and boundless individuality. In 2000 there were 55 art fairs around the world; in 2018 there were 260. (In London, the weeks of the Frieze art fair surpass pre-Christmas as the busiest time of year at department store Dover Street Market.) Fashion and art have not been so close since the days of Elsa Schiaparelli and Salvador Dal\u00ed. Being \u201cin the art world\u201d has come to mean Instagrammable Venice water taxis, Roksanda\u2019s catwalk shows at the Serpentine Pavilion, Erdem eveningwear and Marni earrings. An 1890 painting by Claude Monet in his Haystacks series, which in 1986 was sold for \u00a32m, sold earlier this year for \u00a390.5m. Art has snowballed in cultural value as exponentially as its cash stock has risen. As our culture has become ever more visual \u2013 Instagram is the pop radio of our times \u2013 the status of art, which stands at the apex of our aesthetics, has soared. What\u2019s more, the mood music of the art world is perfect for now. Authenticity, a buzzword of this decade, is rooted in art. Individuality and creativity are honoured in art. And don\u2019t get me started on the word \u201ccurate\u201d, which 10 years ago was an activity specific to museums and galleries but has become the verb du jour, applied to arranging your wardrobe, or laying the table for supper. Art world chic stalked the runways this season. At Bottega Veneta, the elegant but just-slightly-off proportions \u2013 a scoop-neck cream crop sweater with a gold chain trim, worn with the softest leather trousers \u2013 had fans of Phoebe Philo\u2019s era at Celine swooning. At Loewe, the chic understatement of a navy silk gown with a boxy, vest-like cut was catnip to an artfully-aligned audience. At Jacquemus, a sculptural camisole half-tucked into crisp tailored trousers had that insider wink of refined chic. Nothing obviously splashy to see here; but to the trained eye, this is perfection nonetheless. A close alignment with the art world has been a key element in how matchesfashion.com has evolved into a uniquely sophisticated multibrand retailer. Natalie Kingham, fashion and buying director, has long held a chic curator in mind as an imaginary muse. Throughout 2019, the site has partnered with Frieze, hosting salons and pop-ups in tandem as the art fair travels around the world\u2019s most fashionable cities. This is not just about selling dresses to wealthy art collectors, or about using art as inspiration for your look, but about life imitating art \u2013 specifically, the most fashionable life imitating an art-world kind of life. The matchesfashion.com townhouse at 5 Carlos Place in London is designed to feel \u201clike the ultimate collector\u2019s house, where we can host and entertain you, have original conversations and create memorable experiences,\u201d says Jess Christie, chief brand officer. The look crosses all income brackets. Cos is as central a pillar of this aesthetic as Phoebe Philo\u2019s Celine ever was. \u201cArt is ahead of fashion,\u201d says Cos creative director Karin Gustafsson. \u201cArtists reflect their surroundings, and so art tells us where the world is going.\u201d The label on the inside can be an important badge \u2013 old Celine, as designed by Phoebe Philo, was certainly something of an old-school tie for the art sorority \u2013 but the surface is less about logo than texture and quality, and the more elevated high street brands have worked hard at securing loyalty from this customer. \u201cThe quality, the weight, the feel of fabric are extremely important,\u201d says Hannah Gruy, who handles artist liaison at White Cube gallery and whose chic wardrobe saw her featured in a 2012 New York Times article about disciples of Philo, \u201cbut that\u2019s not just Celine or The Row.\u201d And while an \u201carty\u201d slant on chic was once the province of women of a certain age, it has spread to a younger demographic. \u201cWe have always done this look,\u201d says Toast designer Suzie de Rohan Willner of the brand\u2019s aesthetic, which she characterises as \u201ca mix of workwear, traditional craft and contemporary silhouette\u2026 It works at any age, but I am seeing more younger customers.\u201d A look that is, by definition, highly sophisticated is hard to pin down. Often the stamp of authenticity is in the detail, in nuances of thought process, which are a dog whistle to only a certain audience. The morning I speak to Gruy, for instance, she is on her way to \u201ca meeting with someone externally from the gallery, so although it\u2019s raining today, I chose my fancier Celine raincoat, rather than my Uniqlo raincoat.\u201d Our visual culture may have spawned Love Island at one extreme, but it has also facilitated the emergence of a culturally aware, aesthetically literate audience for both fashion and art. \u201cFashion on its own isn\u2019t enough any more,\u201d says creative director Alex Eagle, a best-dressed list fixture and tastemaker across art and fashion, whose store in London\u2019s Soho stocks a chic edit in all categories from the perfect one-piece swimsuit to gorgeous modern ceramics. \u201cPeople are craving a more 360-degree view on culture,\u201d she adds. \u201cArtists aren\u2019t slaves to fashion,\u201d says taxidermy artist Polly Morgan. \u201cI\u2019ve always really liked fashion, but I\u2019ve never bought a fashion magazine in my life.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not literal,\u201d says Gustafsson of how Cos interprets an artistic sensibility into clothes. \u201cIt\u2019s not about clothes that look like paintings, or anything like that.\u201d The first principles of Cos are colour \u2013 a foundation colour card of white, black, navy, sky blue, grey and beige \u2013 and a subtle silhouette which is \u201cabout proportion and the way volume sits around the body\u201d. Designer Francesca Amfitheatrof, alumna of Tiffany and Wedgwood, and now artistic director of jewellery and watches at Louis Vuitton, points to how \u201ca twist in the detail \u2013 an elongated cuff, an extra-long trouser, a raised neckline\u201d \u2013 can be crucial in art-oriented fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the obvious,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes what Nicholas [Ghesqui\u00e8re] does at Vuitton so compelling \u2013 it takes you a while to get it.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Tom Chaplin, singer</strong></h2> <p>We grew up together in Battle and got together as a band in school. I was three years younger, so the other guys waited for my balls to drop before agreeing that I could be the singer. We moved to London in the late 90s and cut our teeth on the classic Camden circuit, towards the end of the Britpop scene, which felt very inspiring for young bands. We were a traditional indie band back then \u2013 our guitarist, <a href=\"https://www.revolvy.com/page/Roundstone-%28band%29\">Dominic Scott</a>, was Irish and adored U2, so there were a lot of big, delayed guitars. After several years we still weren\u2019t getting anywhere, then Dominic told us he was leaving. So Tim [Rice-Oxley] switched from bass to piano. At the time it was unusual to have a piano as the lead instrument and no guitars \u2013 we put in the bass parts on a laptop \u2013 but suddenly everything fell into place.</p> <p>Previously, we\u2019d all contributed songs, but with Tim writing on piano he started handing me things like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50LOhILlLMQ]%20and%20This%20Is%20The%20Last%20Time[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u86VdOc3asA\">Bend </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50LOhILlLMQ]%20and%20This%20Is%20The%20Last%20Time[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u86VdOc3asA\">and Break</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx4Hjq6KwO0\">Everybody\u2019s Changing</a>, which were so much better than anything we\u2019d done before. It was obvious that he\u2019d gone to another level, so Tim became the songwriter, and from then on that was the Keane dynamic.</p> <p>As young men, we didn\u2019t talk about our emotions much, so maybe they poured into the music. I was always reticent to ask Tim what the songs were about, although if he wrote about heartbreak I knew the people, the ex-girlfriends and so on. There are loads of internet theories about what <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oextk-If8HQ\">Somewhere Only We Know</a> means but I always thought that it is about a place where we grew up \u2013 and a longing for something pure and simple. My mum and dad ran a school, and we used to sit in the grounds as teenagers, smoking weed and hanging out: I always thought about that place when I sang the song. To me it\u2019s about us as friends and a band, growing up. </p> <p>We were fish out of water in the London scene, these nice, middle-class boys in our 20s. Meanwhile, some of our old peers were looking down their noses at us because, while they were all becoming successful, we were still pursuing this ridiculous teenage dream. I\u2019m always transported to that place when I sing the song.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oextk-If8HQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Oextk-If8HQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>Tim Rice-Oxley, piano/songwriter</strong></h2> <p>When Dominic left it could have been the end of the band, but it turned out to be a lightbulb moment. I was never that good on bass and found playing piano much easier. Without anyone to do a big guitar solo the songs became less flabby and I got really into the Smiths, whose early songs were really short.</p> <p>We\u2019d been gigging for years, playing to literally two people on occasion, and were licking our wounds. We couldn\u2019t afford to live and rehearse in London any more with the lowly jobs we had, so we moved back to Battle, rehearsing at my mum and dad\u2019s house. I wrote Somewhere Only We Know on the little piano in their front room. I had the driving rhythm of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXgkuM2NhYI\">David Bowie\u2019s Heroes</a> in mind as a starting point, so used the pounding piano like a rhythm guitar and the rest just flowed instinctively.</p> <p>The song is about us being back and having something to cling to. I picture a particular place in Sussex, just a bit of scrub where we used to go when we were kids. There was a fallen pine tree and it seemed like a place to escape from the reality of the band\u2019s failure that seemed to be fast approaching. Richard [Hughes, drummer] recently sent me a photo of the three of us on that exact spot, when we were 11 or something, and I wonder if I\u2019d subconsciously remembered the photo when I wrote the song. The B-side, Snowed Under, contains another local reference \u2013 to <a href=\"http://www.keanetrail.org.uk/mansers-shaw/\">Manser\u2019s Shaw</a>, an old bit of woodland.</p> <p>I remember thinking Somewhere Only We Know was pretty good, then playing it to Richard who said: \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d A record label had expressed some interest so we took a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBIwlB3yP5k\">demo of it</a> on CD it to their office in London and said: \u201cWe think this is the song.\u201d They said they were too busy to listen to it and we never heard from them again. It probably went straight in the bin. Instead, we signed to Island Records. </p> <p>Somewhere Only We Know opened all the doors for us and we\u2019re still playing it 15 years later. I suppose many people have somewhere special that feels like a refuge. People still love that song and a lot of them have pored over the lyrics, trying to work out what it means. As a songwriter, it\u2019s a dream come true. </p> <p>\u2022 Keane\u2019s new album, Cause and Effect, is out on 20 September. They <a href=\"http://keanemusic.com\">tour the UK</a> from 24 September.</p>",

I was three years younger, so the other guys waited for my balls to drop before agreeing that I could be the singer. We moved to London in the late 90s and cut our teeth on the classic Camden circuit, towards the end of the Britpop scene, which felt very inspiring for young bands. We were a traditional indie band back then \u2013 our guitarist, Dominic Scott, was Irish and adored U2, so there were a lot of big, delayed guitars. After several years we still weren\u2019t getting anywhere, then Dominic told us he was leaving. So Tim [Rice-Oxley] switched from bass to piano. At the time it was unusual to have a piano as the lead instrument and no guitars \u2013 we put in the bass parts on a laptop \u2013 but suddenly everything fell into place. Previously, we\u2019d all contributed songs, but with Tim writing on piano he started handing me things like Bend and Break and Everybody\u2019s Changing, which were so much better than anything we\u2019d done before. It was obvious that he\u2019d gone to another level, so Tim became the songwriter, and from then on that was the Keane dynamic. As young men, we didn\u2019t talk about our emotions much, so maybe they poured into the music. I was always reticent to ask Tim what the songs were about, although if he wrote about heartbreak I knew the people, the ex-girlfriends and so on. There are loads of internet theories about what Somewhere Only We Know means but I always thought that it is about a place where we grew up \u2013 and a longing for something pure and simple. My mum and dad ran a school, and we used to sit in the grounds as teenagers, smoking weed and hanging out: I always thought about that place when I sang the song. To me it\u2019s about us as friends and a band, growing up. We were fish out of water in the London scene, these nice, middle-class boys in our 20s. Meanwhile, some of our old peers were looking down their noses at us because, while they were all becoming successful, we were still pursuing this ridiculous teenage dream. I\u2019m always transported to that place when I sing the song. Tim Rice-Oxley, piano/songwriter When Dominic left it could have been the end of the band, but it turned out to be a lightbulb moment. I was never that good on bass and found playing piano much easier. Without anyone to do a big guitar solo the songs became less flabby and I got really into the Smiths, whose early songs were really short. We\u2019d been gigging for years, playing to literally two people on occasion, and were licking our wounds. We couldn\u2019t afford to live and rehearse in London any more with the lowly jobs we had, so we moved back to Battle, rehearsing at my mum and dad\u2019s house. I wrote Somewhere Only We Know on the little piano in their front room. I had the driving rhythm of David Bowie\u2019s Heroes in mind as a starting point, so used the pounding piano like a rhythm guitar and the rest just flowed instinctively. The song is about us being back and having something to cling to. I picture a particular place in Sussex, just a bit of scrub where we used to go when we were kids. There was a fallen pine tree and it seemed like a place to escape from the reality of the band\u2019s failure that seemed to be fast approaching. Richard [Hughes, drummer] recently sent me a photo of the three of us on that exact spot, when we were 11 or something, and I wonder if I\u2019d subconsciously remembered the photo when I wrote the song. The B-side, Snowed Under, contains another local reference \u2013 to Manser\u2019s Shaw, an old bit of woodland. I remember thinking Somewhere Only We Know was pretty good, then playing it to Richard who said: \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d A record label had expressed some interest so we took a demo of it on CD it to their office in London and said: \u201cWe think this is the song.\u201d They said they were too busy to listen to it and we never heard from them again. It probably went straight in the bin. Instead, we signed to Island Records. Somewhere Only We Know opened all the doors for us and we\u2019re still playing it 15 years later. I suppose many people have somewhere special that feels like a refuge. People still love that song and a lot of them have pored over the lyrics, trying to work out what it means. As a songwriter, it\u2019s a dream come true. \u2022 Keane\u2019s new album, Cause and Effect, is out on 20 September. They tour the UK from 24 September.",

A statement that infuriates fans more | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Only the manager can know what selection he has in mind for Tuesday\u2019s visit of Liverpool. It was against the same opponents last year that he pulled one of his more surprising tactical gambits, deploying Maksimovic \u2013 a centre-back \u2013 on the right of a back four. It seemed bold to deprive his team of a pacier option to counter Sadio Man\u00e9, but paid dividends in a deserved 1-0 win.</p> <p>In truth, as became apparent over the course of the season, Ancelotti\u2019s conception of a back four at Napoli is fluid. His team typically lines up in a classic 4-4-2 but in possession the idea is for at least one of the full-backs to push forward, often both.</p> <p>At the same time the wingers may move up to occupy space between midfield and attack. At their most aggressive Napoli seek to split this section of the pitch into quarters, with one striker dropping deep and either a central midfielder stepping up or a full-back advancing even further than he normally would so that a winger can move inside. In practice it can look something like a 2-3-4-1.</p> <p>The idea is to defend on the front foot, retaining possession as much as possible and pressing high with compact lines when it is lost. The risk lies in the transitions. Koulibaly has been uncharacteristically poor so far this season but in theory he and Manolas are well suited to Ancelotti\u2019s approach: both have the pace to prevent teams from breaking with a quick ball over the top.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c467ef784f8a39af2a7c8d0dd0dde9ca968b9c24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c467ef784f8a39af2a7c8d0dd0dde9ca968b9c24/0_28_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dries Mertens has scored three goals in as many games this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dries Mertens has scored three goals in as many games this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ciro de Luca/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even at their best, however, these are not superheroes.

Nikola Maksimovic replaced the new arrival for Sunday\u2019s clean sheet against Sampdoria. Ancelotti insisted afterwards that he plans to use all three as part of a regular rotation policy. Only the manager can know what selection he has in mind for Tuesday\u2019s visit of Liverpool. It was against the same opponents last year that he pulled one of his more surprising tactical gambits, deploying Maksimovic \u2013 a centre-back \u2013 on the right of a back four. It seemed bold to deprive his team of a pacier option to counter Sadio Man\u00e9, but paid dividends in a deserved 1-0 win. In truth, as became apparent over the course of the season, Ancelotti\u2019s conception of a back four at Napoli is fluid. His team typically lines up in a classic 4-4-2 but in possession the idea is for at least one of the full-backs to push forward, often both. At the same time the wingers may move up to occupy space between midfield and attack. At their most aggressive Napoli seek to split this section of the pitch into quarters, with one striker dropping deep and either a central midfielder stepping up or a full-back advancing even further than he normally would so that a winger can move inside. In practice it can look something like a 2-3-4-1. The idea is to defend on the front foot, retaining possession as much as possible and pressing high with compact lines when it is lost. The risk lies in the transitions. Koulibaly has been uncharacteristically poor so far this season but in theory he and Manolas are well suited to Ancelotti\u2019s approach: both have the pace to prevent teams from breaking with a quick ball over the top. Even at their best, however, these are not superheroes. If the team overcommits when attacking, as it did for Danilo\u2019s opening goal against Juventus, the spaces can become impossible to cover. That will be even more true against the speed of Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah. As Ancelotti demonstrated during last season\u2019s encounters, however, he is unafraid to tailor his gameplan to an opponent. The notional 4-4-2 is likely to endure but both the interpretation and the players used against Liverpool may be something we have not seen before. That goes for the attack as well as the defence. Mertens has started the season in fine form, with three goals in three games, and is now only three shy of matching Maradona\u2019s haul of 115 strikes in seven seasons at the club (Marek Hamsik is the club\u2019s all-time record-holder with 121.) But even Mertens is not guaranteed a place against Liverpool. There is the option to go for a more physical approach with Llorente and Milik. \u201cLiverpool are the favourites, they are champions of Europe,\u201d said Ancelotti. \u201cThey have gained greater confidence and have grown even further since we last met. But Napoli have made steps forward as well.\u201d He has tended patiently to his crop over the past 12 months. The moment is approaching, Ancelotti hopes, to reap a bountiful harvest.",

Victims deserve better.\u201d</p> <p>What many delegates conceded was that allegations of abuse within games industry workplaces reflect a wider culture of sexist and misogynistic harassment in the video game playing community. Women in Games is currently working with research firm, Bryter, to expose the extent and severity of toxicity and gendered abuse within gaming. According to Bryter\u2019s Female Gamers report 2019: \u201cLast year, we revealed that one in three female gamers has experienced abuse from their male counterparts, and unfortunately, this statistic has not improved one year on. Not surprisingly, the majority of this is happening online. Of the female gamers who had experienced abuse or discrimination, 31% had received verbal abuse from other male gamers while playing online multiplayer games, 33% had been sent inappropriate content or messages, and 14% had received threats of rape.\u201d</p> <p>The constant message throughout the Women in Games panels was that education is key, not just in the workplace, but much earlier, in a school setting. \u201cWe work with schools and educational institutions all the way from playground to them coming into the industry,\u201d said Emma Smith, head of talent at UK developer, Creative Assembly, which has set up its Legacy Project to tackle representation. \u201cWe talk to girls people and from BAME backgrounds, basically anyone who feels like they are not represented in games to encourage them to have that self-confidence in who they are and what they can bring to the table and make that unshakable no matter what.\u201d</p> <p>This insistence of support from an early age fostered by big studios is slowly starting to reap real world benefits as seen in the diverse demographic of last year\u2019s LCC BA Games Design cohort where a third of recent graduates were women, many going on to studio positions. Larra Anderson, dean of screen at the London College of Communication and host of the conference, also spoke of her commitment to diversifying the creative industries. Pauline Martyn, a 2019 graduate, is now a junior narrative designer at Ubisoft Reflections.</p> <p>One theme throughout the conference was that the culture of game studios, which are still <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/453634/game-developer-gender-distribution-worldwide/\">largely dominated by men</a>, must change. \u201cStudio leaders model the behaviour that becomes the norm,\u201d said Marianne Monaghan, lead cross site producer for Hanger 13. \u201cIf all the leaders are men, if they joke about women in demeaning ways or treat women in a disrespectful way, no amount of HR training will undo that damage. I\u2019m very fortunate to work in a studio with leaders committed to diversity and respect.</p> <p>\u201cI hope, I believe, we\u2019re moving in that direction as an industry but there are still big differences among different studios. I advise women to \u2018interview the interviewers\u2019 and observe studio culture when you visit offices. I don\u2019t work in studios that have an aroma of fear or an excess of alpha males. Not everyone is in a position to be picky, but choose assignments as carefully as you can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1eee37b33cf45c3129f4503bf1a6a0c1e04bb000\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eee37b33cf45c3129f4503bf1a6a0c1e04bb000/15_51_1579_947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberta Lucca, co-founder of Bossa Studios, speaking at the Women in Games conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberta Lucca, co-founder of Bossa Studios, speaking at the Women in Games conference</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Women in Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Retention of gaming studio positions by female employees is key, so educators are not just funnelling women into the metaphorical meat grinder of the games industry.

Anisa Sanusi, a UI/UX designer recently voted one of the top 100 women in games by industry publication Games Industry Biz, suggested that being able to anonymously report on incidences of abuse or harassment in a studio can be a key tool for supporting women. \u201cAnonymity is important,\u201d she said. \u201cOften you want to mention the issue but you don\u2019t want to out yourself because personal safety is a big issue. There is a need to have channels in place for women to voice concerns or complaints where they know they are safe.

And that is not OK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Women\u2019s Super League: talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are other areas of women\u2019s football that have been left behind and are now playing catch-up with the demands of a professional game, refereeing being the most obvious, grassroots development being another. And, to a certain extent, one can forgive the uneven development that has taken place. It has taken time for the FA to build its women\u2019s football staff to the point it is at now with a very genuine, if not always correct, group at the helm.</p> <p>However, the protection of players should be, and should always have been, paramount.</p> <p>It is only this season that Women\u2019s Super League sides have been required to provide medical care for their players. In the semi-professional Championship, where Crystal Palace play, this entry demand will come into effect from only the 2020-21 season and be partially funded by the FA.</p> <p>Yet this issue is not a new discovery. In October last year Emma Beckett, now at Watford, launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for three London Bees players, two of whom needed surgery on ACL injuries, all under the age of 25, with one having ruptured an ACL for the third time. During the crowdfunding campaign a fourth Bees player was added to the list of beneficiaries having also torn her ACL. The story is not uncommon.</p> <p>While investment has gone into building the game, those actually responsible for the product on the pitch, that clubs and the FA are selling to broadcasters and sponsors, have been woefully unprotected and for years forced either to raise thousands of pounds to cover private treatment or to spend months on NHS waiting lists.</p> <p>In addition the standard contracts issued by the FA do more to protect clubs from their injured players than to help players forced from the field, their place of work.</p> <p>Last year the Danish newspaper Politiken, as part of the Football Leaks releases, showed that a clause in player contracts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/23/womens-super-league-football-association-contracts-sack-players-more-than-three-months-injured\" title=\"\">permits WSL clubs to offload players</a> if an injury or illness sidelines them for more than three months, provided they give three months notice.</p> <p>Where male footballers are afforded much greater protections should they suffer one of the most serious injuries that can be picked up on a pitch, with a lengthy recovery period that many say has a big impact on their mental health, a huge number of women footballers have little to no protection.</p> <p>At the time it was made clear that, while it was unlikely that any of the larger WSL clubs would contemplate invoking the clause, it existed to protect less financially insulated teams.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week an FA spokesperson said: \u201cThe Women\u2019s Football Contract was designed and structured to meet the unique demands of the women\u2019s football pyramid. It was developed in consultation between the FA, the clubs and the PFA to shape a player contract that the women\u2019s football pyramid could financially sustain and one that reflects the recently emerging status of women\u2019s professional football in England.</p> <p>\u201cIt differs from men\u2019s professional football, which is more established and better suited to accommodate the additional financial liability of long-term injuries to players. Medical standards are constantly improving and are under regular review to meet the future requirements of the women\u2019s game. Any changes to the Women\u2019s Football Contract will be made in collaboration between The FA, the Clubs and the PFA.\u201d</p> <p>Except surely there is an argument to say that, if a club cannot support even the most basic of insurance policies for its players, then its viability as a functioning and sustainable club in a professional or semi-professional league should be more thoroughly questioned?</p> <p>Most employers, even the smallest, will have insurance policies that cover workplace injury and, in the case of footballers, it is an industry where the risk of injury is high. Player welfare should not be a choice or an afterthought.

      "bodyText": "When Crystal Palace forward Gemma Bryan took to social media last week out of exasperation at having been left \u201cin limbo\u201d by the club after she ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament in April, it caused a wave of disgruntlement. Because, while there has been a drive towards professionalism in the women\u2019s game \u2013 with the FA, sponsors and increasing support of clubs for their women\u2019s teams leading the charge \u2013 player welfare has been neglected. And that is not OK. There are other areas of women\u2019s football that have been left behind and are now playing catch-up with the demands of a professional game, refereeing being the most obvious, grassroots development being another. And, to a certain extent, one can forgive the uneven development that has taken place. It has taken time for the FA to build its women\u2019s football staff to the point it is at now with a very genuine, if not always correct, group at the helm. However, the protection of players should be, and should always have been, paramount. It is only this season that Women\u2019s Super League sides have been required to provide medical care for their players. In the semi-professional Championship, where Crystal Palace play, this entry demand will come into effect from only the 2020-21 season and be partially funded by the FA. Yet this issue is not a new discovery. In October last year Emma Beckett, now at Watford, launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for three London Bees players, two of whom needed surgery on ACL injuries, all under the age of 25, with one having ruptured an ACL for the third time. During the crowdfunding campaign a fourth Bees player was added to the list of beneficiaries having also torn her ACL. The story is not uncommon. While investment has gone into building the game, those actually responsible for the product on the pitch, that clubs and the FA are selling to broadcasters and sponsors, have been woefully unprotected and for years forced either to raise thousands of pounds to cover private treatment or to spend months on NHS waiting lists. In addition the standard contracts issued by the FA do more to protect clubs from their injured players than to help players forced from the field, their place of work. Last year the Danish newspaper Politiken, as part of the Football Leaks releases, showed that a clause in player contracts permits WSL clubs to offload players if an injury or illness sidelines them for more than three months, provided they give three months notice. Where male footballers are afforded much greater protections should they suffer one of the most serious injuries that can be picked up on a pitch, with a lengthy recovery period that many say has a big impact on their mental health, a huge number of women footballers have little to no protection. At the time it was made clear that, while it was unlikely that any of the larger WSL clubs would contemplate invoking the clause, it existed to protect less financially insulated teams. Last week an FA spokesperson said: \u201cThe Women\u2019s Football Contract was designed and structured to meet the unique demands of the women\u2019s football pyramid. It was developed in consultation between the FA, the clubs and the PFA to shape a player contract that the women\u2019s football pyramid could financially sustain and one that reflects the recently emerging status of women\u2019s professional football in England. \u201cIt differs from men\u2019s professional football, which is more established and better suited to accommodate the additional financial liability of long-term injuries to players. Medical standards are constantly improving and are under regular review to meet the future requirements of the women\u2019s game. Any changes to the Women\u2019s Football Contract will be made in collaboration between The FA, the Clubs and the PFA.\u201d Except surely there is an argument to say that, if a club cannot support even the most basic of insurance policies for its players, then its viability as a functioning and sustainable club in a professional or semi-professional league should be more thoroughly questioned? Most employers, even the smallest, will have insurance policies that cover workplace injury and, in the case of footballers, it is an industry where the risk of injury is high. Player welfare should not be a choice or an afterthought. The quicker the FA and clubs move to rectify this abandonment of players who have been prone to accepting the bare minimum, such is the desire to play a sport that has neglected them for so long, the better. Too many have already found their careers and incomes stalled or ended as a result of the governing body and teams playing hardball with their health. Talking points \u2022 Manchester City\u2019s injury problems deepened with the announcement that the 20-year-old forward Georgia Stanway will be out for six weeks with a hamstring injury. Stanway joins fellow forward Lauren Hemp and England\u2019s World Cup top-scorer Ellen White on the sidelines. \u2022 The former Arsenal midfielder Heather O\u2019Reilly is retiring at the end of the season and her \u2018celebration match\u2019 with North Carolina Courage went perfectly as they beat Orlando Pride 6-1.

EJ Yes he helped secure an impossible win, but Jack Leach also did the job asked of him with the ball. Could he be this side\u2019s Ashley Giles? GL Quite literally: Marnus Labuschagne started the Lord\u2019s Test running drinks, and ended it replacing the best batsman in the world. He saved that match and became the only other Australian batsman to deliver consistency under pressure. RS Jofra Archer has the aura, ability and street wisdom of an established superstar, not a Test debutant. His battles with Steve Smith at Lord\u2019s and Matthew Wade at the Oval could have left a curmudgeon high on life. Best match VM Headingley, of course, with its surreal, preposterous climax. Stokes must live with the fact that he can never repeat those deeds with the bat. But I doubt he\u2019ll be too bothered by that. AM Headingley makes it three clear winners in a row, from the position from which England found themselves, 67 all out in the first innings, through to a batshit-crazy final day. Ben Stokes said his innings would count for nothing if England didn\u2019t win back the Ashes but he was wrong. It will be spoken about for decades. AB The Headingley Test certainly wasn\u2019t the greatest ever played given how ordinary the batting was for the first three days, but there surely can\u2019t have been many that were more fun to watch. BR Headingley was affecting on so many levels. Edgbaston was the most convincing team performance. Even the Oval was fun and flighty. EJ Headingley was a great finish, but the action at Lord\u2019s was exciting throughout, if you ignore the rain \u2013 including that fourth-day spell where Archer seemed, like Halle Berry, to summon his own storm. GL Obviously. Broad and Archer sizzling against Warner\u2019s resistance on day one. Australia\u2019s demolition of England for 67. England\u2019s bowlers scrapping to stay in the game. Then Stokes with the impossible dream. Both teams in it till the last ball. Headingley. RS Euphoric sporting moments often become bittersweet if your team does not go on to win the ultimate prize. But the miracle of Headingley, and the feeling it evoked, will last forever. Best moment VM Stokes reverse sweeping Lyon for six at Headingley. Suddenly it seemed as if anything was possible. And it was. AM Beyond the final scenes in Leeds \u2013 not least the Western Terrace as Ben Stokes crunched the winning runs \u2013 and some memorable duels throughout, let\u2019s go for Ricky Ponting\u2019s commentary at Old Trafford as the camera pointed to a gaggle of Australian players late on day four. \u201cI was going to say the Aussie brains trust are in the picture ... but David Warner is there.\u201d AB Those dizzy final few minutes at Headingley, of course, when everyone fell under Ben Stokes\u2019 spell. Jofra Archer\u2019s ferocious fast bowling to Steve Smith at Lord\u2019s, too even if, as Smith put it, \u201che still didn\u2019t get me out.\u201d BR Stokes through the covers. EJ Cummins\u2019s delivery to dismiss Root first ball at Old Trafford seemed a pretty decent summary of England\u2019s series. But I\u2019m English, so I prefer bathos to pathos. I\u2019ll go for Leach and Stokes bumping grilles as they ran to embrace at Headingley. GL Warner copping a barrage on the Edgbaston boundary, then facing the crowd to turn his pockets inside out. And Smith walking off at the Oval after his last innings to a full house of applause. RS \u201cEngland need one to win. And in comes Pat Cummins from the far end. He bowls to Stokes \u2013 WHO HAMMERS IT FOR FOUR! And stands there with the bat raised! I can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen that.\u201d Biggest grumble VM How the Test series threatened to overshadow the absolutely riveting news of those lucrative coaching appointments from overseas for teams in the Hundred competition. AM That the peak audience was 2 million people (Headingley) in a summer when 8.92 million in the UK watched the epic denouement to the World Cup final due to the simulcast of Sky\u2019s coverage on Channel 4. One shared Test per summer to showcase the heart and soul of the sport \u2013 is it too much to ask? AB The schedule, which meant England\u2019s best players were back in training camp the week after the World Cup, and the rest of their players barely had a championship match for practice all summer. BR The idea there\u2019s something that needs to be \u201cfixed\u201d in red-ball cricket. This was the best sporting event of the year played in front of full houses. Just show it to people. It\u2019s good. EJ Some people found the booing a bit much. Others didn\u2019t enjoy the Crying Steve Smith masks. But it\u2019s the piped Jerusalem that\u2019s starting to feel really old. GL Technology. Dodgy ball-tracking, dodgy snickometer, no-balls not called, players having to umpire. Surely the fourth official can monitor the front-foot camera, and third umpires can intervene when decisions look wrong. RS A few minor grumbles, like the absence of Jimmy Anderson from the Ashes, but no biggies \u2013 the whole summer has been a joy. The next Ashes series will be\u2026 VM In Australia. If Archer is still standing alongside one of the other young quicks on the circuit that should be exciting too. Still not sure who is going to score the runs. AM Bloody hard for England to win, despite all the talk of blueprints and the emergence of a world-class (and seemingly robust) fast bowler in Archer. Joe Root and the new head coach have two and a bit years to figure it out. AB The one Joe Root finally wins as a captain. BR A fast-bowling shootout. Freeze Jofra in carbon. Get that ECB pace-bowling programme going. More. More of this. EJ Of a higher standard than this one. Because the players won\u2019t be suffering post-World Cup fatigue, and both sides will have remembered how to bat. GL Long. Smith is still hungry, and will get more support on Australian pitches. England have two years to build a batting order that can deliver, and some bowlers who can support Archer for incisiveness. RS Painfully one-sided, unless England give red-ball cricket a whole lotta love in the next two and a half years. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

You can\u2019t fool me.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>There\u2019s more, unfortunately:</p> <blockquote> <p>She stared at him. He was dapper, neat, brisk, with brilliant, liquid brown eyes and dark hair. He had a jutting nose, a full-lipped mouth and a look about him that said he was not a man to play tricks with, yet a hint he could be pleasant enough if folks were pleasant with him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd yes,\u201d thought Miss Pettigrew; \u201csomewhere in his ancestry there has been a <em>Jew</em>.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>She revisits this idea later:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t advise marrying him,\u201d she tells her friend Miss LaFosse. \u201cI don\u2019t like to jump to conclusions but I <em>think</em> there was a little Jew in him. He wasn\u2019t <em>quite</em> English. And, well, I do think when it comes to marriage it\u2019s safer to stick to your own nationality.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Shorn of context, it\u2019s easy to see why these quotes cause offence. Even with context, they\u2019re hard to forgive, and I don\u2019t want to. This book was published in 1938. That kind of talk wasn\u2019t just morally poisonous. Jewish people were already being murdered and losing their rights in Nazi Germany, and refugees were being <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/refugees\">turned away at international borders</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/03/enid-blyton-racism\">Enid Blyton had racist views. But I still read her | Sian Cain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s no point in pretending that antisemitism was not common in genteel prewar Britain, or in denying that the characters in a delightful novel would share those opinions. (The characters\u2019 beliefs as distinct from the author\u2019s.) These snatches of dialogue may upset us but also be accurate to their world. What are we to make of the fact that Watson was prepared to disfigure her otherwise beautiful creation with those lines quoted above? Should our political and moral objections to those passages alter our reading of the rest of the book?</p> <p>These are perennial questions; they have been asked of Roald Dahl, HP Lovecraft, JRR Tolkien and most recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/03/enid-blyton-racism\">in the Guardian, Enid Blyton</a>. My general conclusion is that you can call out racism in a book without consigning it to history. We don\u2019t have to like these things being said, but we should know about them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/10/miss-pettigrew-lives-for-a-day-has-naughtiness-ever-been-so-nice\">Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day: has naughtiness ever been so nice?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And if you start blacklisting writers such as Winifred Watson for letting her characters say reprehensible things, where do you stop? I for one would miss reading Shakespeare and Charles Dickens and TS Eliot and just about everyone else who wasn\u2019t born in our apparently more enlightened times. Aristophanes regarded everyone who spoke in a foreign language as a barbarian (which is to say, people who said \u201c<em>bababababa</em>\u201d when they spoke). Do we also have to lose all of his daft knob gags as a result? What can we expect future generations to say about us? Would we be cancelled?</p> <p>Such abstract arguments are very distant from the real hurt that those lines I\u2019ve quoted can cause. I still find them repulsive. But to accept that a book has imperfections is not the same as endorsing them. The world is complicated and so is literature \u2013 even when it\u2019s supposed to be fun.</p>",

He had a jutting nose, a full-lipped mouth and a look about him that said he was not a man to play tricks with, yet a hint he could be pleasant enough if folks were pleasant with him. \u201cAnd yes,\u201d thought Miss Pettigrew; \u201csomewhere in his ancestry there has been a Jew.\u201d She revisits this idea later: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t advise marrying him,\u201d she tells her friend Miss LaFosse. \u201cI don\u2019t like to jump to conclusions but I think there was a little Jew in him. He wasn\u2019t quite English. And, well, I do think when it comes to marriage it\u2019s safer to stick to your own nationality.\u201d Shorn of context, it\u2019s easy to see why these quotes cause offence. Even with context, they\u2019re hard to forgive, and I don\u2019t want to. This book was published in 1938. That kind of talk wasn\u2019t just morally poisonous. Jewish people were already being murdered and losing their rights in Nazi Germany, and refugees were being turned away at international borders. There\u2019s no point in pretending that antisemitism was not common in genteel prewar Britain, or in denying that the characters in a delightful novel would share those opinions. (The characters\u2019 beliefs as distinct from the author\u2019s.) These snatches of dialogue may upset us but also be accurate to their world. What are we to make of the fact that Watson was prepared to disfigure her otherwise beautiful creation with those lines quoted above? Should our political and moral objections to those passages alter our reading of the rest of the book? These are perennial questions; they have been asked of Roald Dahl, HP Lovecraft, JRR Tolkien and most recently in the Guardian, Enid Blyton. My general conclusion is that you can call out racism in a book without consigning it to history. We don\u2019t have to like these things being said, but we should know about them. And if you start blacklisting writers such as Winifred Watson for letting her characters say reprehensible things, where do you stop? I for one would miss reading Shakespeare and Charles Dickens and TS Eliot and just about everyone else who wasn\u2019t born in our apparently more enlightened times. Aristophanes regarded everyone who spoke in a foreign language as a barbarian (which is to say, people who said \u201cbababababa\u201d when they spoke). Do we also have to lose all of his daft knob gags as a result? What can we expect future generations to say about us? Would we be cancelled? Such abstract arguments are very distant from the real hurt that those lines I\u2019ve quoted can cause. I still find them repulsive. But to accept that a book has imperfections is not the same as endorsing them. The world is complicated and so is literature \u2013 even when it\u2019s supposed to be fun.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cPush \u2018em back, push \u2018em back, waaay back!\u201d is a classic American football chant encouraging the players to muscle the opposition back down the field. Today\u2019s fan participation is a lot more complicated, especially after Major League Soccer <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/portland-timbers/story/3935328/timbers-army-fans-suspended-for-iron-front-flag\">recently banned a group of Portland Timbers fans</a> from attending three matches at Providence Park for waving flags that displayed the anti-fascist Iron Front symbol (this weekend, <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/seattle-sounders-fans-walk-out-of-match-due-to-mls-ban-1838146924\">Seattle Sounders fans walked out of a match</a> in protest at the ban on \u201cpolitical\u201d banners). Now when we yell that nostalgic \u201cPush \u2018em back\u201d cheer we have to ask more complicated questions, such as who does \u201c\u2019em\u201d refer to: the opposing team, the owners, or the fans? By \u201cpush\u201d do you mean to bully people \u2013 owners, non-political fans, outspoken fans \u2013 out of their rights? And by \u201cway back\u201d do you mean back out of the stadium or back to the 1950s when politics and sports rarely crossed paths?</p> <p>For 50 years, I have been an outspoken supporter of athletes\u2019 right to silently protest during sporting events. Whether it\u2019s raising a fist, as Tommie Smith and John Carlos did during the 1968 Olympics, or Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem, or LeBron James wearing an \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d t-shirt while warming up for a game, athletes have a constitutional right to express their outrage over social injustice in the hopes of improving lives. Clearly, fans should have those same rights. But no one\u2019s rights are absolute when the act of expressing them may restrict someone else\u2019s rights. So, when championing the fans\u2019 rights in this situation, there are a few considerations that have to be acknowledged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/21/mls-and-antifa-americas-top-flight-grapples-with-political-signage-ban\">MLS and Antifa: America's top flight grapples with political signage ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Athletes who protest during sports events have traditionally done so silently. Their act is designed to raise public awareness to inspire positive change while being respectful of the game. They do nothing to interfere with the sporting event, which would infringe on the fans\u2019 rights. Although some owners and fans claim that any reminder of politics hurts their enjoyment, that\u2019s an unreasonable reaction to the relatively brief and unobtrusive expression of constitutional rights on behalf of those marginalized people being denied their rights.</p> <p>The first problem with the stance that sporting events should be non-political is that the playing of the national anthem itself introduces politics into the sporting event. It\u2019s blatantly pandering in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/12/history-national-anthem-sports-military-flag\">an effort to associate the event with patriotism</a>, akin to a politician kissing a baby or petting a puppy. It\u2019s like telling a fan, \u201cYou\u2019re being patriotic just by being here, slurping beer and chomping a hot dog.\u201d Before 2009, NFL players <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nfl-sideline-anthem/\">weren\u2019t required to even come out of the locker room</a> for the playing of the anthem. In 2015, a joint oversight report revealed that $5.4m of taxpayer money had been paid to 14 NFL teams between 2011 and 2015 for displays of \u201cpatriotic salutes\u201d to the military. Between 2012 and 2015, the US department of defense <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/nfl-dod-national-anthem-6f682cebc7cd/\">spent at least $10.4m</a> on \u201cmarketing and advertising contracts with professional sports teams.\u201d This isn\u2019t patriotism by the teams, it\u2019s commerce. There is nothing patriotic about a ball passing over a goal-line or through a hoop and we shouldn\u2019t sanctify our games as a litmus test of who deserves to express their opinions. Teams should have the right to make such deals, but they shouldn\u2019t then suppress free speech while they\u2019re busy selling the right to speak to the highest bidder.</p> <p>What leagues can do is insist that expressions of political allegiance are maintained within consistent parameters that insure they don\u2019t interfere with fans watching the event they paid to enjoy. By consistent, I mean that if a stadium allows American flags or team banners to be waved or displayed, then they should allow political flags and banners of the same size to be waved by fans, as long as they don\u2019t promote symbols of hate and violence, such as swastikas. Certainly, if fans held up large banners that blocked the view of other spectators, that would be a violation. But if you allow a MAGA hat or t-shirt then you have to allow an Iron Front hat or t-shirt.</p> <p>Team owners have expressed fear that the interjection of politics, no matter how noble the purpose, will alienate their fanbase. Part of this fear was stoked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/20/nfl-anthem-protests-revenue-tv-ratings-attendance\">President Trump\u2019s tweets in 2017</a>, at the height of player protests, that the NFL ratings were \u201cWAY DOWN\u201d and that \u201cThe American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem.\u201d Not surprisingly, this was false. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/20/nfl-anthem-protests-revenue-tv-ratings-attendance\">The NFL increased its revenue by 5% in 2017</a>. When Nike launched an ad campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, the conventional wisdom chortled that Nike would take a huge commercial hit from that mysterious and feared fanbase that hates free speech. It didn\u2019t happen. Instead, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/nike-sales-booming-kaepernick-ad-invalidating-critics/story?id=59957137\">Nike\u2019s sales rose by 10%</a>.</p> <p>Fear is the greatest enemy of free speech and facts are the greatest cure to that fear. <a href=\"http://www.quoteambition.com/famous-thomas-jefferson-quotes/\">Thomas Jefferson urged us to</a> \u201ceducate and inform the whole mass of the people\u2026 They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.\u201d But, with so many Russian trolls disseminating false information in an effort to sway our elections, with a president who lies on a daily basis, with news outlets like Fox News that have been proven to report misinformation, and with most people restricting their input of information to sources they already agree with, sometimes the only way to convey an opposing opinion to the population at large is through public gatherings. Which is why it\u2019s all the more important to make sure those avenues of expression stay open.</p> <p>One of the reasons we embrace sports so dearly is that they can symbolize human interaction at its most noble: fair play, meritocracy, sportsmanship, competitiveness, striving to be better, pushing the limits of human achievement. Curtailing the free speech of athletes or fans is not consistent with our vision of sports. Or our vision of democracy.</p> <ul> <li><p>You can read a full archive of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kareem-abdul-jabbar\">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s articles for the Guardian here</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

Now when we yell that nostalgic \u201cPush \u2018em back\u201d cheer we have to ask more complicated questions, such as who does \u201c\u2019em\u201d refer to: the opposing team, the owners, or the fans? By \u201cpush\u201d do you mean to bully people \u2013 owners, non-political fans, outspoken fans \u2013 out of their rights? And by \u201cway back\u201d do you mean back out of the stadium or back to the 1950s when politics and sports rarely crossed paths? For 50 years, I have been an outspoken supporter of athletes\u2019 right to silently protest during sporting events. Whether it\u2019s raising a fist, as Tommie Smith and John Carlos did during the 1968 Olympics, or Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem, or LeBron James wearing an \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d t-shirt while warming up for a game, athletes have a constitutional right to express their outrage over social injustice in the hopes of improving lives. Clearly, fans should have those same rights. But no one\u2019s rights are absolute when the act of expressing them may restrict someone else\u2019s rights. So, when championing the fans\u2019 rights in this situation, there are a few considerations that have to be acknowledged. Athletes who protest during sports events have traditionally done so silently. Their act is designed to raise public awareness to inspire positive change while being respectful of the game. They do nothing to interfere with the sporting event, which would infringe on the fans\u2019 rights. Although some owners and fans claim that any reminder of politics hurts their enjoyment, that\u2019s an unreasonable reaction to the relatively brief and unobtrusive expression of constitutional rights on behalf of those marginalized people being denied their rights. The first problem with the stance that sporting events should be non-political is that the playing of the national anthem itself introduces politics into the sporting event. It\u2019s blatantly pandering in an effort to associate the event with patriotism, akin to a politician kissing a baby or petting a puppy. It\u2019s like telling a fan, \u201cYou\u2019re being patriotic just by being here, slurping beer and chomping a hot dog.\u201d Before 2009, NFL players weren\u2019t required to even come out of the locker room for the playing of the anthem. In 2015, a joint oversight report revealed that $5.4m of taxpayer money had been paid to 14 NFL teams between 2011 and 2015 for displays of \u201cpatriotic salutes\u201d to the military. Between 2012 and 2015, the US department of defense spent at least $10.4m on \u201cmarketing and advertising contracts with professional sports teams.\u201d This isn\u2019t patriotism by the teams, it\u2019s commerce. There is nothing patriotic about a ball passing over a goal-line or through a hoop and we shouldn\u2019t sanctify our games as a litmus test of who deserves to express their opinions. Teams should have the right to make such deals, but they shouldn\u2019t then suppress free speech while they\u2019re busy selling the right to speak to the highest bidder. What leagues can do is insist that expressions of political allegiance are maintained within consistent parameters that insure they don\u2019t interfere with fans watching the event they paid to enjoy. By consistent, I mean that if a stadium allows American flags or team banners to be waved or displayed, then they should allow political flags and banners of the same size to be waved by fans, as long as they don\u2019t promote symbols of hate and violence, such as swastikas. Certainly, if fans held up large banners that blocked the view of other spectators, that would be a violation. But if you allow a MAGA hat or t-shirt then you have to allow an Iron Front hat or t-shirt. Team owners have expressed fear that the interjection of politics, no matter how noble the purpose, will alienate their fanbase. Part of this fear was stoked by President Trump\u2019s tweets in 2017, at the height of player protests, that the NFL ratings were \u201cWAY DOWN\u201d and that \u201cThe American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem.\u201d Not surprisingly, this was false. The NFL increased its revenue by 5% in 2017. When Nike launched an ad campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, the conventional wisdom chortled that Nike would take a huge commercial hit from that mysterious and feared fanbase that hates free speech. It didn\u2019t happen. Instead, Nike\u2019s sales rose by 10%. Fear is the greatest enemy of free speech and facts are the greatest cure to that fear. Thomas Jefferson urged us to \u201ceducate and inform the whole mass of the people\u2026 They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.\u201d But, with so many Russian trolls disseminating false information in an effort to sway our elections, with a president who lies on a daily basis, with news outlets like Fox News that have been proven to report misinformation, and with most people restricting their input of information to sources they already agree with, sometimes the only way to convey an opposing opinion to the population at large is through public gatherings. Which is why it\u2019s all the more important to make sure those avenues of expression stay open. One of the reasons we embrace sports so dearly is that they can symbolize human interaction at its most noble: fair play, meritocracy, sportsmanship, competitiveness, striving to be better, pushing the limits of human achievement. Curtailing the free speech of athletes or fans is not consistent with our vision of sports. Or our vision of democracy.

      "bodyText": "The supreme court hearing into whether Boris Johnson unlawfully shut down parliament is likely to rule against the prime minister, the shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, has said. Eleven judges are due to begin a hearing on Tuesday at the court in central London that Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks in the run-up to Brexit was not constitutional and stifled debate. \u201cI think the supreme court is highly likely, or certainly, let\u2019s put it this way, equally likely to follow in the direction of the highest court in Scotland,\u201d the Labour peer told the Radio 4 Today programme before the hearing. A case heard in Scotland on 11 September brought by 75 opposition MPs and peers found that the prime minister had acted unlawfully. Another case heard in the high court of England and Wales deemed the issue \u201cpolitical\u201d and non-justiciable. Appeals to both decisions will be heard by the supreme court with a decision due on Thursday. Before the hearing scores of protesters opposing the suspension of parliament gathered outside the supreme court. Among the demonstrators was a man carrying a sign describing himself as \u201cThe Incredible Sulk\u201d in reference to Johnson comparing himself to the Marvel comic character Hulk. Others carried signs declaring: \u201cDefend Democracy,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Silence Our MP,\u201d \u201cReopen Parliament\u201d and \u201cThey Misled The Queen.\u201d Lady Chakrabarti said: \u201cThere are two issues here.

Whether they abused their prerogative power, to suspend parliament, to shut it down in this way.\u201d The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told the BBC he backed prorogation and the government would argue in court that it was a \u201cproper course\u201d to take. In an attempt to distance himself from a Downing Street source who cast doubt on the Scottish judiciary\u2019s independence, he lavished praise on the country\u2019s judges. Buckland said: \u201cThey are world-class. They are world-leading. Let them do their job. And I want to make sure whatever the decision is of the supreme court, we will respect the robust independence of our judiciary.\u201d Asked if he would respect the result, after Johnson and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, both said they would want to review any decision that went against them, Buckland said: \u201cThe principle of respecting the independence of our judiciary is one that runs right through our system and we must do that in this instance.\u201d The former supreme court justice Jonathan Sumption told BBC Newsnight he thought the government ought to win but suggested judges might be outraged at Johnson\u2019s approach.

But for the past two years, the number of moths that have made the journey to those areas from breeding grounds in Queensland, NSW and western Victoria has crashed to almost undetectable levels and scientists are turning to the community for help. A new website, led by Zoos Victoria, is asking Australians to take a photo if they think they see a bogong moth, and to record when and where they saw it. Called Moth Tracker, the website has been set up to try gather information on the migration routes of the bogong moth and what the coming summer will bring for the species and animals that rely on them. That includes the mountain pygmy possum, a critically endangered marsupial that hibernates for five to seven months of the year. Just 2,000 of them remain in the wild. When the possum emerges from under the snow, the bogong moth is its main food source. Last year, scientists monitoring the mountain pygmy possum late in the breeding season in Victoria found that between 50% and 95% of the animals had lost their full litters of young. Analysis found the animals had starved to death without their main food source. \u201cThe migration of bogong moths has occurred for over 7,000 years and their arrival in the alpine zone is the second biggest arrival of nutrients in the area after the sun,\u201d Marissa Parrott, a reproductive biologist at Zoos Victoria, said. \u201cThey\u2019re an important species in their own right and they\u2019re crucially important for mountain species like the pygmy possum as well as birds, frogs and plants.\u201d Parrott said researchers had developed the Moth Tracker website because not enough was known about why the moths were not making it to their summer destination. The collapse in numbers is unprecedented and there are three likely causes scientists are exploring. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning They are the ongoing drought in south-eastern Australia, changes in agricultural practices such as spraying of crops or flooding of areas for cotton and rice production, and light pollution in urban areas that diverts the moths away from their migration path. In addition to asking Australians to log sightings of moths \u2013 and how many \u2013 on the website, the researchers are also asking for assistance in the south-east of the country to reduce light pollution. Some of the greatest beacons are sporting fields and Canberra\u2019s Parliament House and its surrounds. Until the end of October, the scientists are asking people to turn off unnecessary outdoor lighting. To use the Moth Tracker website, participants just need to take a photo, upload it the website, along with the time of the sighting, location and how many moths. An expert will then examine the photo and if it is identified as a bogong moth it will be logged on a map. Parrott said it was hoped the data would help researchers to create short- and long-term strategies to aid in the recovery of the moths and the possums. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this loss of moths happening before,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re gathering all the data we can \u2026 so that we can have both short-term and long-term strategies to protect these species and learn more about what is an unprecedented event.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The only man who spoke after Valencia\u2019s 5-2 defeat at Barcelona on Saturday was the man who had been there only three days and had nothing to say. Albert Celades had just begun his spell as the club\u2019s 10th manager in five years by suffering the worst defeat since Gary Neville took his team to the same stadium three years earlier and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/04/gary-neville-valencia-job-barcelona-historic-humiliation-\" title=\"\">let in seven</a>. He faced the media alone, nothing he could offer of any use or any comfort to anybody; the players did not appear and nor did the president. Three days later there was still no sign. Ahead of the game against Chelsea no Valencia player met the media on Monday night.</p> <p>If they were trying to feign normality, or avoid more noise, they went about it in a strange way. Saying nothing was the most powerful statement of all. Celades gave what little he could and then left. Three days earlier there had been an actual statement, released as they slipped out of the Camp Nou in silence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/frank-lampard-chelsea-valencia-champions-league\">Frank Lampard wary of Valencia threat despite off-field uncertainty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The statement only deepened the division, a communiqu\u00e9 so misjudged that it seemed to confirm the suspicion that they just don\u2019t get it. \u201cWe\u2019ve suffered but those of us who love Valencia have to come together,\u201d it said. \u201cWithout fights, without distractions that only hurt us. <em>Es lo que hay</em>. Let\u2019s close ranks and defend Valencia. Without ever looking back.\u201d</p> <p>Without looking back on that thing you\u2019ve just done, you mean?</p> <p>Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral had arrived at the club in 2017. Valencia had finished 12th in each of the two previous seasons, lurching through crises, going through six managerial changes in the previous 18 months alone. But under him Valencia had twice finished fourth as well as beating Barcelona to win the Copa del Rey \u2013 the club\u2019s first trophy in over a decade. Working alongside him was the new director general, Mateu Alemany, and there was stability at last, a clear plan, success too. And now, three games into the season, Valencia sacked him. Alemany is expected to follow.</p> <p>Every line of the statement hit fans right between the eyes. They doubted that love, for a start. What, they have long asked, is Peter Lim\u2019s real objective in owning Valencia? When was the last time he was even in the city? The fights and the distractions had been of his making; it was not them hurting Valencia. Nor, they felt, were they the ones causing the division. And as for <em>es lo que hay</em>, that was hard to take. Although it doesn\u2019t translate perfectly, it means something along the lines of \u201cthat\u2019s the way it is,\u201d or \u201cit is what it is\u201d. Tough luck, in other words. But it did not need to be this way.</p> <p>The sacking had long been inevitable, though. Marcelino met the decision with \u201cincredulity and powerlessness\u201d but he could well believe it. He claimed the moment he knew something was wrong was the moment he led Valencia to the Cup win. When he went to Singapore to see the owner, he says, he was congratulated for getting into the Champions League but not for winning the Cup. Valencia\u2019s priority had been a return to Europe, not the Cup. And while success was to be celebrated, his decision to ignore suggestions that he jettison the Cup underlined very different views of how to run the club. Insubordination comes at a cost.</p> <p>At that point the club was increasingly run by Alemany and Marcelino. The owner had some concerns about how and to whose benefit. At the start of the season results had been poor, even if performances were not always as bad as the stats suggested, and it was Alemany who stood by the manager. They came through the crisis; it appeared they had won more than games. Perhaps, though, the seeds of defeat were sown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c17332bd363d0d33f2b6bcb671ae97471a935171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c17332bd363d0d33f2b6bcb671ae97471a935171/0_76_4000_2539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Valencia\u2019s Ezequiel Garay, right, in action here against Barcelona, has criticised the sacking of Marcelino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valencia\u2019s Ezequiel Garay, right, in action here against Barcelona, has criticised the sacking of Marcelino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the captain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/08/valencia-dani-parejo-unai-emery-talk-miguel-brito-fell-asleep\" title=\"\">Dani Parejo put last spring</a>, his words made ironic by hindsight: \u201cWith the arrival of Mateu Alemany, with Pablo [Longoria, the sporting director], there is a stability now and the club knows where it is going.

      "bodyText": "The only man who spoke after Valencia\u2019s 5-2 defeat at Barcelona on Saturday was the man who had been there only three days and had nothing to say. Albert Celades had just begun his spell as the club\u2019s 10th manager in five years by suffering the worst defeat since Gary Neville took his team to the same stadium three years earlier and let in seven. He faced the media alone, nothing he could offer of any use or any comfort to anybody; the players did not appear and nor did the president. Three days later there was still no sign. Ahead of the game against Chelsea no Valencia player met the media on Monday night. If they were trying to feign normality, or avoid more noise, they went about it in a strange way. Saying nothing was the most powerful statement of all. Celades gave what little he could and then left. Three days earlier there had been an actual statement, released as they slipped out of the Camp Nou in silence. The statement only deepened the division, a communiqu\u00e9 so misjudged that it seemed to confirm the suspicion that they just don\u2019t get it. \u201cWe\u2019ve suffered but those of us who love Valencia have to come together,\u201d it said. \u201cWithout fights, without distractions that only hurt us. Es lo que hay. Let\u2019s close ranks and defend Valencia. Without ever looking back.\u201d Without looking back on that thing you\u2019ve just done, you mean? Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral had arrived at the club in 2017. Valencia had finished 12th in each of the two previous seasons, lurching through crises, going through six managerial changes in the previous 18 months alone. But under him Valencia had twice finished fourth as well as beating Barcelona to win the Copa del Rey \u2013 the club\u2019s first trophy in over a decade. Working alongside him was the new director general, Mateu Alemany, and there was stability at last, a clear plan, success too. And now, three games into the season, Valencia sacked him. Alemany is expected to follow. Every line of the statement hit fans right between the eyes. They doubted that love, for a start. What, they have long asked, is Peter Lim\u2019s real objective in owning Valencia? When was the last time he was even in the city? The fights and the distractions had been of his making; it was not them hurting Valencia. Nor, they felt, were they the ones causing the division. And as for es lo que hay, that was hard to take. Although it doesn\u2019t translate perfectly, it means something along the lines of \u201cthat\u2019s the way it is,\u201d or \u201cit is what it is\u201d. Tough luck, in other words. But it did not need to be this way. The sacking had long been inevitable, though. Marcelino met the decision with \u201cincredulity and powerlessness\u201d but he could well believe it. He claimed the moment he knew something was wrong was the moment he led Valencia to the Cup win. When he went to Singapore to see the owner, he says, he was congratulated for getting into the Champions League but not for winning the Cup. Valencia\u2019s priority had been a return to Europe, not the Cup. And while success was to be celebrated, his decision to ignore suggestions that he jettison the Cup underlined very different views of how to run the club. Insubordination comes at a cost. At that point the club was increasingly run by Alemany and Marcelino. The owner had some concerns about how and to whose benefit. At the start of the season results had been poor, even if performances were not always as bad as the stats suggested, and it was Alemany who stood by the manager. They came through the crisis; it appeared they had won more than games. Perhaps, though, the seeds of defeat were sown. As the captain Dani Parejo put last spring, his words made ironic by hindsight: \u201cWith the arrival of Mateu Alemany, with Pablo [Longoria, the sporting director], there is a stability now and the club knows where it is going. It is off the pitch and on the pitch. Now the coaches here are not working with the idea that \u2018maybe tomorrow they\u2019ll get rid of me\u2019. And that has its repercussions. One can feel it. That has been seen this year. In other circumstances they could have got rid of the m\u00edster. Thanks to Mateu for placing his faith in the coach and we have had the results from that.\u201d That message became standard in Spain; implicitly, it stated that things had got better when the club\u2019s owner had taken his hands off the reins and let people who know get on with it \u2013 which is rarely likely to please an owner with any pride and a heavy investment. When Valencia won the Copa del Rey, it was presented as Alemany\u2019s, Marcelino\u2019s and the players\u2019 success, not Lim\u2019s. In fact, it was often interpreted as arriving despite the owner. The \u201cMarcelino good, Lim bad\u201d narrative \u2013 which has continued even more powerfully after the sacking \u2013 jarred. Then this summer the division deepened over plans to strengthen the squad. The potential departure of Rodrigo Moreno and the failure to sign Rafinha or Denis Su\u00e1rez were particular bones of contention. So, too, the future of Lee Kang-in, the South Korean youth product earmarked as a future star but who rarely featured under Marcelino. Lim took back control, diminishing the authority of Alemany and Marcelino. The divide got ever more public; one crisis was contained in a meeting in Singapore, but not for long. Marcelino\u2019s words were increasingly provocative; at times he almost appeared to be daring them to sack him. Last Wednesday they did. They could not blame results. Valencia\u2019s president, Anil Murthy, talked of the need to respect a supposed club \u201cphilosophy\u201d of bringing through youth players \u2013 which was the first anyone had heard of that. The players\u2019 position was clear. Like most of them the centre-back Ezequiel Garay sent a message of thanks to Marcelino on social media.

Populist historians tell people \u2013 especially those who have voted for them \u2013 what they want to hear about the past. Remembering the war is a zero-sum game to them: it\u2019s about winners and losers. They care little about the complexities and even less about acknowledging dark chapters of Poland\u2019s collective past. What have we really learned from the past? Old photos of a completely destroyed Warsaw reminded me of news images of other cities, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/15/how-war-shattered-aleppo-is-preserving-its-culture\" title=\"\">Aleppo</a>, that have in more recent times experienced the full brutality of a military onslaught. All the more reason to be reminded of what went before us and of those caught up in the horror.</p> <p>But for populist historians \u2013 and not only in Poland \u2013 history is not about learning lessons; it is either a plaything to salve national complexes or a weapon to use in foreign policy (for example, in Polish-Ukrainian or Polish-Israeli relations).</p> <p>Machcewicz along with the museum\u2019s other founding historians, Janusz Marszalec, Rafa\u0142 Wnuk and Piotr M Majewski, responded to all this with a loud \u201cno\u201d. They have sued the new director of the museum over the infringement of their copyright for the exhibition\u2019s content and managed to halt other changes to the museum. I totally agree with Machcewicz, who <a href=\"http://wyborcza.pl/magazyn/7,124059,23233695,pis-przejal-juz-muzeum-ii-wojny-swiatowej-teraz-idzie-po.html\" title=\"\">describes this saga</a> as \u201cPoland\u2019s most important dispute about history in years\u201d.</p> <p>The case, which the courts have yet to rule on, is the first of its kind in Poland and probably in Europe. I can\u2019t think of another example of an exhibition mounted by a major museum being censored by a government because it pays too much attention to civilians and because it insufficiently glorifies the nation. It feels more like the standards that would be applied in Putin\u2019s Russia than in a democratic member state of the European Union.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/16/norway-denial-far-right-violence-breivik\">Norway is in denial about the threat of far-right violence | Sindre Bangstad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/22/philosophy-1968-the-year-of-revolt\" title=\"\">Leszek Ko\u0142akowski</a>, one of Poland\u2019s greatest philosophers, wrote in his essay, Doctor Faustus: \u201cWe learn about the past to know how to recognise around us those faces touched by its worst legacy.\u201d To me, a young Pole, this surely is the best definition of the point of studying history. It will hardly surprise you that communist censors didn\u2019t let Ko\u0142akowski publish those words. And now, 30 years after the communist regime collapsed in Poland, history is again being manipulated for political motives. It\u2019s as if only one version \u2013 that approved by a rightwing government that has overseen countless acts of democratic backsliding and is seeking re-election next month \u2013 is acceptable. Anyone who sees things differently is deemed a public enemy.</p> <p>When I started looking into the Gda\u0144sk museum dispute as a news story, it felt like a good issue to report \u2013 especially as I had studied history at university and am passionate about it. But gradually it became something more deeply personal; I realised that this was about our collective values. And it should be personal for anyone who cares about pluralism and free debate. This is a battle to safeguard history that\u2019s not written in black and white, nor aimed at serving a political agenda, but history that inspires us to make connections between the past and today\u2019s world. Big words, you might say. But those four historians who are taking on the government have picked a fight that goes far beyond the future of one museum. This has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/28/far-right-european-elections-eu-politics\" title=\"\">European meaning</a>.

Nawrocki, for example, replaced a filmed summary of civilians\u2019 experiences in the war with another film altogether, in which the soundtrack includes claims that can only be described as propaganda, with phrases such as: \u201cwe saved Jews\u201d; \u201cwe give life in the name of dignity and freedom\u201d; \u201cwe were betrayed\u201d; \u201cthe pope gave hope of victory\u201d; \u201ccommunists lose\u201d; \u201cwe won\u201d and \u201cwe do not beg for freedom, we fight for it\u201d. This is populist history. Populist historians tell people \u2013 especially those who have voted for them \u2013 what they want to hear about the past. Remembering the war is a zero-sum game to them: it\u2019s about winners and losers. They care little about the complexities and even less about acknowledging dark chapters of Poland\u2019s collective past. What have we really learned from the past? Old photos of a completely destroyed Warsaw reminded me of news images of other cities, such as Aleppo, that have in more recent times experienced the full brutality of a military onslaught. All the more reason to be reminded of what went before us and of those caught up in the horror. But for populist historians \u2013 and not only in Poland \u2013 history is not about learning lessons; it is either a plaything to salve national complexes or a weapon to use in foreign policy (for example, in Polish-Ukrainian or Polish-Israeli relations). Machcewicz along with the museum\u2019s other founding historians, Janusz Marszalec, Rafa\u0142 Wnuk and Piotr M Majewski, responded to all this with a loud \u201cno\u201d. They have sued the new director of the museum over the infringement of their copyright for the exhibition\u2019s content and managed to halt other changes to the museum. I totally agree with Machcewicz, who describes this saga as \u201cPoland\u2019s most important dispute about history in years\u201d. The case, which the courts have yet to rule on, is the first of its kind in Poland and probably in Europe. I can\u2019t think of another example of an exhibition mounted by a major museum being censored by a government because it pays too much attention to civilians and because it insufficiently glorifies the nation. It feels more like the standards that would be applied in Putin\u2019s Russia than in a democratic member state of the European Union. The late Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, one of Poland\u2019s greatest philosophers, wrote in his essay, Doctor Faustus: \u201cWe learn about the past to know how to recognise around us those faces touched by its worst legacy.\u201d To me, a young Pole, this surely is the best definition of the point of studying history. It will hardly surprise you that communist censors didn\u2019t let Ko\u0142akowski publish those words. And now, 30 years after the communist regime collapsed in Poland, history is again being manipulated for political motives. It\u2019s as if only one version \u2013 that approved by a rightwing government that has overseen countless acts of democratic backsliding and is seeking re-election next month \u2013 is acceptable. Anyone who sees things differently is deemed a public enemy. When I started looking into the Gda\u0144sk museum dispute as a news story, it felt like a good issue to report \u2013 especially as I had studied history at university and am passionate about it. But gradually it became something more deeply personal; I realised that this was about our collective values. And it should be personal for anyone who cares about pluralism and free debate. This is a battle to safeguard history that\u2019s not written in black and white, nor aimed at serving a political agenda, but history that inspires us to make connections between the past and today\u2019s world. Big words, you might say. But those four historians who are taking on the government have picked a fight that goes far beyond the future of one museum. This has a European meaning. It concerns us all. \u2022 Estera Flieger is a journalist with Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza",

Today I acknowledge that many from Tonga will be mourning the passing of Prime Minister \u2018Akilisi P\u014dhiva, and I stand with them at this time. Having served in the Tongan parliament for over 30 years, Mr Pohiva has been his country\u2019s prime minister for the past five.</p> <p>He was the first commoner in Tonga to be elected to this high office. He was one of the country\u2019s longest serving parliamentarians, a prime minister who dedicated his life to the service of his country. </p> <p>He spoke strongly on confronting the challenge of climate change and he continued this advocacy for Tonga, despite his ill health, at the recent Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. </p> <p>His country\u2019s democratic evolution towards constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy will be among his legacies. </p> <p>I would make this remark: if we recognise the importance of our Pacific neighbours to this nation we should extend respect to our Tongan friends during this difficult time, I think, by formally acknowledging his passing via a condolence in this chamber. </p> <p>It is the right thing to do to for our Tongan friends.

We made sure that those people who were impacted were not out-of-pocket. We have also got grants available for household goods and for the rebuilding of their properties, and we stand ready, with the Queensland government, when they make further application for assistance. </p> <p>But what was sobering, Mr Speaker, this morning was when I met the assistant commissioner, Megan Stiffler, who ran operations, and a stark reminder of her assessment the night those fires started. </p> <p>They made an assessment that there would be fatalities. The catastrophic nature of the fire that took place around Stanthorpe and Applethorpe meant that there was very little that they thought that they could do, that there would be fatalities. </p> <p>Proudly, because of the meticulous planning of those men and women, both professional and volunteers, had put in place, meant that not one life has been lost. </p> <p>Homes have been lost, and I met a family today. And to the day that they lost their house, it marked 50 years since they emigrated from France to Australia. Yet despite the pain and anguish that they and their family felt, all they were concerned about, all that they were proud about, was that they had a small town community that put their arms around them, and they had firemen and women that stood there with them and tried to protect their homes and their properties. </p> <p>Like Pedro. Pedro is a captain of the rural fire brigade at Stanthorpe, just a knockabout bloke. He and his battalion worked for over 24 hours trying to save their community. Ordinary Australians doing extraordinary things. </p> <p>We should be proud of the fact that, in these darkest days, in these darkest days, average Australians become great Australians.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Anthony Albanese:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do want to associate Labor with the remarks of the minister, congratulate him on the nature of those remarks, but more importantly, on behalf of our side, join with your side of the house in congratulating all those men and women, whether they be paid, but particularly those volunteers, who are going out there and helping their fellow Australians at this difficult time.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T05:19:29.643Z\">at 6.19am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d8069c78f08f9df5bdd5c30\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T05:07:53.104Z\">6.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bob Katter </strong>is next and I don\u2019t know what to tell you.

In fact, the figures available just today are 125,000, for an increase of over 25,000 places and 25% in one year.</p> <p>That is potentially one of the largest increases in home care places, both in terms of raw numbers and in percentage in Australian history. </p> <p>In addition to that, what I can also say is that we are now projected to increase to 157,000 places by 2022-23. </p> <p>So that is a 161% increase in home care places on our watch, in our time.

And now: Robodebt.<br></p> <p>Today we are happy to announce that, following conversations with myself, Gordon Legal intends to launch a class action on behalf of victims of the harsh and inaccurate robodebt scheme. </p> <p>... Since becoming the Shadow Minister for Government Services I have formed the view that the toxic robodebt scheme, put in place in mid-2016, is built on shaky legal foundations. <br></p> <p>The Government has used a flawed calculation system to unlawfully take back millions of dollars from pensioners. The Federal Government has financially benefited by wrongfully taking and banking money that legitimately belonged to recipients.</p> <p> The robodebt scheme \u2013 including its reverse onus of proof \u2013 is at best legally dubious and should rightly have its legality determined by a court.</p> <p>Other legal actions by robodebt victims have invariably resulted in the Government entirely waiving or dramatically reducing the claimed debt, and settling the action. But the individual nature of the actions has meant the legality of robodebt generally has not been tested.</p> <p>In this action lawyers for robodebt victims will argue that the Commonwealth has been unjustly enriched by amounts of money it has falsely recouped from recipients of inaccurate debt compliance notices.</p> <p>Labor supports legitimate debt recovery and data matching provided it has proper human oversight. Robodebt is none of these things.<br></p> <p>\u201cMinister Stuart Robert admits an error rate of at least one-in-five. Insiders know it is malfunctioning and are covering it up because the Government wants the revenue apparently at any cost,\u201d Mr Shorten said.</p> <p>\u201cThe victims of robodebt need their day in court so it can be determined whether what appears to be a bureaucratic standover racket has any proper legal foundation whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStress, heartbreak, suicides \u2013 this is the trail of carnage that robodebt has wrought.</p> <p>... Gordon Legal are in discussions with several robodebt victims who could be plaintiffs in the planned action. Others who have had legitimate Centrelink benefits illegally clawed back with an interest in the action can register their details on the Gordon Legal website.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T04:26:33.844Z\">at 5.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d805e2f8f08f30dc5bbcb23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T04:17:28.902Z\">5.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Michael McCormack</strong> has just had to tell the parliament that there was an election, and \u201cwe won\u201d.</p> <p>The gluten-free toast I had for dinner last night had more substance. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T04:27:28.483Z\">at 5.27am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d805dda8f08f9df5bdd5c05\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T04:15:40.618Z\">5.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labor has started question time in the Senate by asking <strong>Anne Ruston </strong>how many of the Coalition\u2019s budgets since 2014 have cut the pension.<br></p> <p>Ruston started to answer the question but Labor objected on the grounds of relevance, leading the Liberal leader in the Senate, <strong>Mathias Cormann</strong>,<strong> </strong>to respond that pensions go up twice a year.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Penny Wong </strong>suggested he felt the need to intervene to help a \u201cweak minister\u201d.<br></p> <p>The supplementary is about how many times the Coalition has tried to increase the pension age to 70.

Under our government, welfare goes where it is needed and it is targeted and it is done in a sustainable way, to ensure that all of those who rely absolutely on the welfare bill, Mr Speaker, of this country can depend on it in the future.</p> <p>And you know what, Mr Speaker? If you can\u2019t manage money, if you are a government that doesn\u2019t know how to manage money, you can\u2019t say to the pensioners of Australia that you will support their pension into the future. </p> <p>Under the Labor party, they had to miss medicines, Mr Speaker, they had to endure cuts to defence, they had to put a flood levy on, Mr Speaker, because they did not know how to manage money. </p> <p>The Labor party has to take responsibility for the implications for the consequences, Mr Speaker, of their failure to manage money. </p> <p>At the last election, we said very clearly Labor can\u2019t manage money, and that means they come after yours. </p> <p>They will ensure, Mr Speaker, through their mismanagement, that Australians miss out, that essential services that Australians rely on can never be guaranteed by the Labor party, whether it is hospitals or schools or the NDIS or aged care. </p> <p>And they can bark and shout all they like, Mr Speaker, but the truth is, Labor can\u2019t manage money.</p> <p>... I am asked about the pension. And I will tell you what I won\u2019t do. We won\u2019t take away the imputation credits, Mr Speaker, for pensioners who simply want to manage their own money, Mr Speaker. At the last election, the Australian people know that Labor were coming after older Australians\u2019 money, and they said no to Labor.</p> </blockquote> <p>(So that is a yes then \u2013 there are cuts to the supplement.

It should be Centrelink who makes the case. </p> <p>Leaving aside all the humour of having the member for Fadden as the minister, there\u2019s a serious issue here. </p> <p>How is it the case that in 2019 individual Australians can receive a letter of demand from the government and, immediately upon receipt of the letter of demand, it is the recipient of the letter, the Australian citizen, who then has to argue with the might of the Australian government to say the debt is not correct? </p> <p>We put very clearly here today that the onus of proof for these debts lies with the government, that the sheer process of an algorithm data-matching annual ATO data with fortnightly payments paid by the Department of Human Services does not discharge the obligation of the government to a satisfactory level. </p> <p>It is not enough to rely on a robotic letter of demand, with no proof and no supporting material, and simply reverse the onus of proof on Australian citizens. </p> <p>It is not the job of the government of Australia to oppress individual citizens. That is not the role of the state. </p> <p>The onus rests with the government. </p> <p>When there is a serious allegation saying that you owe the government money, I would put that the burden is even greater than just the data-matching process, because consequences flow from saying to a citizen that they owe the government money. You get the private debt collectors on to you. </p> <p>If you have a finding of debt, you can\u2019t get finance. If you\u2019re a law student with a debt finding, you can\u2019t be admitted as a lawyer. </p> <p>There are consequences from the government\u2019s assertion that the individual owes a debt with no supporting evidence. </p> <p>There are consequences of that which make it more grave and more severe. And because of the severity of the consequences of a finding of debt it increases the obligation upon the government to prove the system. </p> <p>There is no lawful basis for the government to just assert debt on the part of citizens with a cursory algorithm and data matching and then say it\u2019s up to the citizen. But this is not just a question of whether or not it is lawful; it is also immoral. </p> <p>Robodebt causes hardship. It causes stress. This flawed, inaccurate data, where people are required to pay a debt when it is not clear how the debt is constituted, leaves individuals stranded. </p> <p>The process for appealing these debts is inadequate. </p> <p>In closing, not only is the system unlawful, not only is it immoral, along with the consequences and the stresses it has, but we are seeing a calculated strategy of cover-up by the government. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T02:12:32.054Z\">at 3.12am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d803efd8f08f9df5bdd5b9d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katharine-murphy\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T02:04:16.324Z\">3.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Shorten likely to flag the robodebt scheme is unlawful</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That media event from <strong>Bill Shorten </strong>looks interesting. </p> <p>Last week, in a little-noticed matter of public importance debate, Shorten flagged concern that robodebt might be unlawful. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no lawful basis for the government to just assert debt on the part of citizens with a cursory algorithm and data matching and then say it\u2019s up to the citizen,\u201d Shorten said. </p> <p>He went on to say: \u201cBut this is not just a question of whether or not it is lawful; it is also immoral.\u201d<br></p> <p>Given today\u2019s event is with <strong>Peter Gordon</strong>, I\u2019d say he\u2019s going to expand on that theme.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T02:13:21.558Z\">at 3.13am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d803d078f08f9df5bdd5b90\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T01:55:24.470Z\">2.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The bells are ringing for the official start of the parliament session.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T01:59:57.293Z\">at 2.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d803b428f08f9df5bdd5b8b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T01:49:03.875Z\">2.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bill Shorten </strong>has announced a press conference for 1pm with \u201cGordon Legal Senior Partner <strong>Peter Gordon</strong>, and will be making an announcement on robodebt\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T01:53:27.101Z\">at 2.53am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d8032188f08f30dc5bbca73\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T01:09:08.085Z\">2.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is the official release on that:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Minister for drought David Littleproud announced the Future Drought Fund Consultative Committee as an important milestone in taking action on drought.</p> <p>The committee will now develop the drought resilience funding plan for the fund, which begins with a $3.9bn credit that will grow to $5bn.</p> <p>... chair, Mr Brent Finlay, and committee members Dr <strong>Kate Andrews, Dr Wendy Craik AM, Dr Elizabeth Peterson and Ms Caroline Welsh</strong> will begin their work in Canberra later this month.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T01:10:30.999Z\">at 2.10am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d8031798f08f30dc5bbca71\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T01:08:04.785Z\">2.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This in from<strong> David Littleproud,</strong> who was in Queensland for a press conference with <strong>James McGrath </strong>two seconds ago.

We still believe all the risks exist in terms of deterring investment and that\u2019s what we really need in this country. We need investment in our existing system. We need investment in new parts of the energy market. We think it will deter it. We think it is a highly risky piece of legislation and we think it\u2019s unnecessary. You\u2019ve got the competition regulator yesterday announcing that for 800,000 small businesses and households prices have gone down. And this legislation will not put downward pressure on prices. So, look you know, the government took it to an election. They\u2019ve got a mandate to do it. What we\u2019re trying to do is to work constructively with them to get the legislation in better shape, to make sure it doesn\u2019t have these unintended consequences. And we\u2019ve worked very hard on that and so we are hoping the government takes our suggested amendments very seriously.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>HM</strong>: What\u2019s the evidence that it will affect investment?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well I think you\u2019ve got to look at it from an investor\u2019s point of view. If a government starts actually negotiating contracts on your behalf, if government is interfering in pricing, if there is capacity for a government to actually divest your assets. You know if you\u2019re a company you have to ask yourself are you seriously going to put a lot of your shareholder\u2019s money at risk. That\u2019s the fundamental problem we\u2019ve got. And I think the problem we\u2019ve got with this legislation and always have had is that it will not actually achieve reduction in prices. There are many other things that the competition regulator said could be done. And then the competition regulator has said that this is an extreme measure, this proposed legislation. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T00:14:01.918Z\">at 1.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d8023188f08f9df5bdd5b2b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T00:09:43.944Z\">1.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Now that what was obviously the biggest scandal of the day has been cleared up (her office confirmed we were right).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/anguslivingston/status/1173742258622881792\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EXCLUSIVE RECREATION: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmyRemeikis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AmyRemeikis</a> confirms normal-sized hands cannot hold saladas in this fashion, CHEDS CONFIRMED <a href=\"https://t.co/Vkx2nnItxE\">pic.twitter.com/Vkx2nnItxE</a></p>&mdash; Angus Livingston (@anguslivingston) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anguslivingston/status/1173742258622881792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 16, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It might be worth noting that we haven\u2019t heard from any senior federal Liberals on the NSW mess.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/24/gladys-berejiklian-leads-coalition-to-third-term-in-government-in-nsw\">March 24 seems like forever ago:</a><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An ebullient prime minister, Scott Morrison, warmed up the crowd before the premier arrived on Saturday night, taking to the stage to declare: \u201c<strong>How good is Gladys Berejiklian and how good is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party\">Liberal party</a> here in NSW?\u201d</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T00:15:10.384Z\">at 1.15am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d8022cd8f0834740f3bc7f1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T00:03:46.577Z\">1.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here <strong>Richard Marles</strong> gives us some idea of where Labor is going today:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fact here is that the single biggest factor in terms of where the Australian economy is at, is this government\u2019s failure to manage it over the last six years.

But it does put the NSW government majority under threat.

They were quite enjoying the NSW Labor issues and now those are overshadowed. There are more questions over <strong>Gladys Liu\u2019s </strong>fundraising. <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> is having to warn the business community to stay calm as tensions in the Middle East hit a new flashpoint.

      "bodyText": "The chambers have gone quiet, so we\u2019ll wrap this up for the night. Scott Morrison has one full day left in the country before his US trip, so there will be a bit of politicking tomorrow, before he takes off. Tomorrow is also Midwinter Ball night (yes, we all paid for our tickets, like we do every year). We should hear about the final budget outcome statement tomorrow, as well as Mathias Cormann\u2019s explanation to the Senate on Gladys Liu. Speaking of Liu, the challenge against the Chisholm signs is in the high court tomorrow, for directions. So there won\u2019t be a lot of information, but we\u2019ll find out a little more about the case (it cannot lead to a byelection, but may put in rules about what is allowable on signs for the next election). And no doubt there will be plenty more happening that I haven\u2019t even begun to think of. That\u2019s politics, after all. Thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin for all of their stellar work today, and every day. I am just a typing monkey standing amongst their photo and word ballet. And a big thank you to everyone who read today, even those who got a bit cranky (must be something in the air, because there were a few of you today, if my DMs and inbox are anything to go by). I get it. It happens. Thanks for reading anyhow. We\u2019ll be back bright and early tomorrow morning. In the meantime, take care of you. Pauline Hanson, who will be the deputy chair of the family court inquiry, also had this to say: \u201cFor those of you contemplating suicide, and facing potential family violence, I am asking you to stop.\u201d \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636 I was just thinking of \u02bbAkilisi P\u014dhiva today, who died on 12 September. It turns out so was Ed Husic. He questioned why the parliament, which noted the passing of John McCain, had not officially noted the passing of the Tongan prime minister: Chifley is home to many people whose heritage hails from the Pacific Islands, including nearly 2,500 Tongan Australians, the most of any electorate in Australia. Today I acknowledge that many from Tonga will be mourning the passing of Prime Minister \u2018Akilisi P\u014dhiva, and I stand with them at this time. Having served in the Tongan parliament for over 30 years, Mr Pohiva has been his country\u2019s prime minister for the past five. He was the first commoner in Tonga to be elected to this high office. He was one of the country\u2019s longest serving parliamentarians, a prime minister who dedicated his life to the service of his country. He spoke strongly on confronting the challenge of climate change and he continued this advocacy for Tonga, despite his ill health, at the recent Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. His country\u2019s democratic evolution towards constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy will be among his legacies. I would make this remark: if we recognise the importance of our Pacific neighbours to this nation we should extend respect to our Tongan friends during this difficult time, I think, by formally acknowledging his passing via a condolence in this chamber. It is the right thing to do to for our Tongan friends. Vale, Prime Minister \u2018Akilisi P\u014dhiva. I was then reminded of this video: Pauline Hanson cried in her press conference, overcome by all the people in Australia who will now get justice because of the family court review. \u201cI cried because I know the heartache that is felt by hundreds of thousands of Australians,\u201d she said. \u201cI also cried because of the realisation of the hope that this inquiry will finally bring to people who are floundering in these situations.\u201d She said she would cry more, during the inquiry. She was asked about Michelle D\u00f6rendahl, the mother of Eeva, who was murdered by her father. She said that men lose children too. \u201cThat was a case of a mother that\u2019s lost her child. There are cases of fathers who have lost their child. This is why this inquiry needs to be heard, to get to the bottom of the answers that are needed,\u201d she said. Sarah McNamara from the Australian Energy Council is telling Patricia Karvelas on Afternoon Briefing that the big stick legislation will damage investment in the sector: Our real concern is this bill will do nothing to lower energy costs for Australian homes and businesses and, in fact, it will have the opposite effect. The reason is, it gives the government and its regulator the power to enter into businesses and determine their contracting and the terms on which their generators contract. It enables the government to direct retail pricing as well through its regulator if it has concerns about retail pricing and, ultimately, it gives the government the power in some circumstances to apply to the court to divest forcibly energy market participants from their assets. That does not send a positive signal to would-be investors in this market and our real concern is this is a market that badly needs new investment in order to stabilise prices. Pauline Hanson is speaking on this right now. Sarah Martin will bring you that. But here are the terms of reference for the family court review (it\u2019s due to report back in October 2020): a. ongoing issues and further improvements relating to the interaction and information sharing between the family law system and state and territory child protection systems and family and domestic violence jurisdictions; including: i. the process, and evidential and legal standards and onuses of proof, in relation to the granting of domestic violence orders and apprehended violence orders; and ii. the visibility of, and consideration given to, domestic violence orders and apprehended violence orders in family law proceedings; b. the appropriateness of family court powers to ensure parties in family law proceedings provide truthful and complete evidence, and the ability of the court to make orders for non-compliance and the efficacy of the enforcement of such orders; c. beyond the proposed merger of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court any other reform that may be needed to the family law and the current structure of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court; d. the financial costs to families of family law proceedings, and options to reduce the financial impact, with particular focus on those instances where legal fees incurred by parties are disproportionate to the total property pool in dispute or are disproportionate to the objective level of complexity of parenting issues, and with consideration being given amongst other things to banning \u201cdisappointment fees\u201d, and: i. capping total fees by reference to the total pool of assets in dispute, or any other regulatory option to prevent disproportionate legal fees being charged in family law matters; and ii. any mechanisms to improve the timely, efficient, and effective resolution of property disputes in family law proceedings; e. the effectiveness of the delivery of family law support services and family dispute resolution processes; f. the impacts of family law proceedings on the health, safety and wellbeing of children and families involved in those proceedings; g. any issues arising for grandparent carers in family law matters and family law court proceedings; h. any further avenues to improve the performance and monitoring of professionals involved in family law proceedings and the resolution of disputes, including agencies, family law practitioners, family law experts and report writers, the staff and judicial officers of the courts, and family dispute resolution practitioners; i. any improvements to the interaction between the family law system and the child support system; and j. the potential usage of pre-nuptial agreement and their enforceability to minimise future property disputes; and k. any related matters. The Senate has also passed a Greens motion \u201ccalling for the government to provide data on Jobactive compliance to the Senate by tomorrow\u201d. The government let it through on the voices \u2013 they opposed it last week, but it looks like Labor had the numbers this time around (which must have meant that Centre Alliance came around). Which means that tomorrow morning Mathias Cormann will have to front the Senate to give: (i) an explanation of the Government\u2019s response to the allegations raised against the Member for Chisholm, and (ii) an assurance to the Senate that the Member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person to remain a member of the Australian Parliament; and (b) a senator may, at the conclusion of the Minister\u2019s explanation, move without notice, that the Senate take note of the explanation. And it passed. Labor is moving this motion now: Mr President I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move that the Senate\u2014 (1) notes widespread reports in the media about the Member for Chisholm over the last week, which raise questions concerning her fitness to be a member of the Australian Parliament; and (2) at 9.30 am on 18 September 2019, before government business is called on: (a) requires the Minister representing the Prime Minister (Senator Cormann) to provide, for no more than 20 minutes: (i) an explanation of the Government\u2019s response to the allegations raised against the Member for Chisholm, and (ii) an assurance to the Senate that the Member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person to remain a member of the Australian Parliament; and (b) a senator may, at the conclusion of the Minister\u2019s explanation, move without notice, that the Senate take note of the explanation. The LNP motion for an inquiry into the effect of farming and water quality on the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 inspired by Peter Ridd but neutral on its face \u2013 has been voted up by the Senate 33 votes to 30, with Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick and One Nation voting with the Coalition. Labor attempted to amend the motion at the last minute to inquire into the Coalition\u2019s $444m reef grant, but that failed to throw a spanner in the works. Patrick told Guardian Australia that Centre Alliance \u201cgenerally votes for all inquiries unless they\u2019re politically charged\u201d and \u201cthe outcome of the inquiry will fall according to the evidence\u201d. Malcolm Roberts just stood up and said the Greens have not met his challenge to prove to him how people are impacting climate change and Elon isn\u2019t answering his messages and he\u2019s stuck on this planet and it\u2019s not fair.* *The bit about Elon and being stuck on this planet was my dramatic flourish, but it was the mood of the moment. I just realised something. Scott Morrison leaves for the US trip on Thursday. He won\u2019t be in question time. That means Michael McCormack will be acting prime minister on a sitting day. And in question time. Whatever I did to be punished in this way, I apologise. But there is no way the punishment can fit the crime, no matter what it is. Question time as seen by Mike Bowers: John Setka will be interviewed by Hamish McDonald on RN tomorrow morning at 7.30. He has so far resisted all calls to resign or step down. Jacqui Lambie says she will vote for the government\u2019s ensuring integrity bill if Setka does not stand down. The Tveeder transcript of that press conference from Stuart Robert, Australian citizen, includes a lot of exclamation marks, because he seemed a little worked up. Even though robodebt technically started in 2016, under the Turnbull government, Robert is trying to claim that Labor\u2019s announcement it was moving to automation in 2011 means it is to blame: It started in 2011, if you read the press release, a new data matching exercise from Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek. They could not have been clearer! Labor, when they started this process in 2011. The ombudsman then reported it and made the point, in fact I think it is section 3.4, say it is entirely appropriate for the commonwealth government to collect debts. Q: Mr Shorten may not have filed papers but it seems he has got himself a lawyer, Gordon lawyers, are you saying you do not expect this to go ahead? Robert: If you are going to launch a class action before question time and you are serious about it, would you ask a single question of the government minister during question time? You think on May 9 and a journalist asks you \u2018Is robodebt lawful?\u2019 Would you say no, we want to make sure any Australian receiving welfare is not getting more than they are entitled to and no one received a leave pass? It\u2019s the exact words that Mr Shorten made and miraculously four months later now Bill wants to give 900,000 Australians a leave pass but cannot explain where the $5m in revenue will come from. ... I am sure we will let the court process stand for itself. ... There is no case, there is no papers. Bill Shorten stood there and appealed for people to come forward to help in his political stunt and that is where we are right now! Thanks very much. Stuart Robert keeps referring to people as \u201cAustralian citizens\u201d and, while accurate, it also just sounds a little ... distant? Stuart Robert says the class action against robodebt is a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d: I will let the cases speak for themselves but remember citizens at any point have the opportunity to bring forward documents to show that the income they reported to Centrelink matches or explains the discrepancy between what is reported in their tax return and Australians who have been asked to explain that and present those documents at any point in the process. ... The way income compliance has always worked, since Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek introduced data matching in 2011, in June, in fact, in and the press release is instructive to read, the report is matched against what they report in the tax return to the ATO and if there is a discrepancy, Australians are asked to explain the discrepancy. There is always a person in the chain so that they can speak to the Australian and the Australian citizen has the opportunity to explain the discrepancy. Stuart Robert\u2019s office has just released this list of previous comments from Labor MPs on the recovery of debts. \u2018If people fail to come to an arrangement to settle their debts, the Government has a responsibility to taxpayers to recover that money.\u2019 Tanya Plibersek, Media Release, 29 June 2011 \u2018The automation of this process will free up resources and result in more people being referred to the tax garnishee process, retrieving more outstanding debt on behalf of taxpayers.\u2019 Bill Shorten, Media Release, 29 June 2011 \u2018It is important that the Government explores different means of debt recovery to ensure that those who have received more money than they are entitled to repay their debt.\u2019 Chris Bowen, Media Release, 15 June 2010 \u2018I think most people would expect that we have a rigorous checking system, and covert surveillance is one of our, as I say, one of the weapons in our armoury. We have data matching, where we check our records against the Tax Office\u2019s records to make sure that it all adds up and there\u2019s not people who are paying tax on a job who are also claiming welfare.\u2019 Chris Bowen, Interview with Stuart Bocking, 7 April 2010 \u2018We want to make sure that people aren\u2019t receiving welfare to which they\u2019re not entitled to. And no one gets a leave pass on that.\u2019 Bill Shorten, doorstop interview, Redcliffe hospital, 9 May 2019 No one has said that overpaid monies should not be paid back, but there have been massive issues with the process. And while the automation process may have been hatched under Labor, it was implemented and carried out by the Coalition. So, yes, these comments stand \u2013 but it is the process of robodebt, how it has been carried out, and the inadequacies of that process, which is under question here. The Women\u2019s Legal Service Queensland is in Canberra, and has responded to yet another review into the family court system: Women\u2019s Legal Services Queensland (WLSQ) is visiting federal politicians today with family violence survivor Michelle D\u00f6rendahl to outline problems with the family law system that put people in danger. Michelle\u2019s daughter Eeva was murdered by her father during a court-approved access period. The system had failed to acknowledge and respond to the evidence of family violence. WLSQ is calling for a federal Family and Domestic Violence Court in order to acknowledge and response appropriately to the 50% and up to 85% of matters in the family courts that involve family violence in order to keep children safe. Women\u2019s Legal Services Queensland CEO Angela Lynch said: \u201cFamilies are being traumatised and dangerous decisions are being made by a system that does not properly acknowledge domestic violence. \u201cAustralia needs a federal family violence court in order to protect children from the dangerous decisions that are made when the system does not have the necessary specialisation. \u201cIn the criminal system, we have specialist courts for drug issues because we know that with a specialist approach we can get better justice outcomes. In family law, we need a family violence court in order to keep children safe from violence. \u201cA family violence court is necessary because of a lack of domestic violence specialist expertise and resources throughout the whole system including a lack of access to legal assistance services by victims. \u201cWe must also start implementing thorough reviews of all family violence deaths to determine the full extent to which institutional failings have contributed. \u201cOver 50% and up to 85% of the matters that reach a hearing in the family law court involve some form of family violence, therefore it is essential that the system is capable of identifying and dealing with complex family violence issues. \u201cThe family law system needs to have a specialist Family and Domestic Violence Court so that cases have the necessary expertise and the safety of children and others at risk are always put first. \u201cThe most important thing in any family law decision should be the safety of children. Until we have a system that is able to acknowledge and deal with family violence the safety of children will be put at risk.\u201d After no mention all Senate question time, Kimberley Kitching finishes with one on Gladys Liu. Mathias Cormann replies: Gladys Liu was elected for Chisholm because the majority of Australians in Chisholm elected her. The prime minister has full confidence in the member for Chisholm. If Labor has anything other than smear and innuendo \u2013 put it up, put it up. Asked if Scott Morrison will \u201callow\u201d Liu to make a statement to parliament, Cormann replies that Liu fulfils her responsibilities \u201cas she sees fit\u201d and it is \u201can offensive question\u201d. Kitching then asks if Liu is a \u201cfit and proper person\u201d, Cormann repeats aspects of his previous answers, leading Penny Wong to shout \u201csay it now, say it now, say it now\u201d. He does not say it now. And that\u2019s the end of Senate question time. Stuart Robert will respond to Bill Shorten\u2019s robodebt announcement at 3.40. It\u2019s worth making note of this: Scott Morrison has put out the official release on the family court inquiry: The Prime Minister has announced the Government will undertake a Joint Parliamentary Committee of both the House and the Senate to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the family law system. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the review would look at whether the current system, which is intended to support parents and children during the end of a relationship, is fit for purpose. \u201cWe want to ensure families can resolve issues as quickly and fairly as possible, so everyone can move on with their lives,\u201d the Prime Minister said. \u201cThis inquiry will allow the Parliament to hear directly from families and listen to them as they give their accounts of how the family law system has been impacting them and how it interacts with the child support system. \u201cThis is a serious issue that has been raised by Members and Senators across the Parliament and I look forward to the Parliament working together through this Committee to bring forward recommendations that look at how the system can be improved.\u201d The inquiry will have broad terms of reference and be led by the Hon Kevin Andrews MP, who has considerable experience as both an MP and Minister in dealing with these issues. The Government has already proposed substantial reform in some relevant family law structures, such as the merger of the two courts that primarily deal with family law matters \u2013 the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court. This reform, which will be re-introduced before the end of 2019, is focused on helping parents resolve issues at the end of their relationship as simply, quickly and cheaply as possible. The Government is also considering the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission report into family law which was released in April this year and will respond in full to all of those recommendations relating to the design of multiple important provisions in the Family Law Act 1974. Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations the Hon Christian Porter MP said the Select Committee\u2019s focus would be on specific areas where there may be scope for improvement in the family law system, the courts or other policy areas such as child support. It will also look at how the family law system, state and territory child protection systems and family and domestic violence jurisdictions can communicate better. \u201cAmongst other issues, it will address important operational issues of enforcement of court orders and legal costs to families of family law proceedings, with a particular focus on instances where legal fees are disproportionate to the total asset pool or issues in dispute,\u201d said the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations. \u201cImportantly for older Australians who find themselves taking on the parental role for grandchildren, the Committee will have a particular focus on issues affecting grandparent carers in family law matters and family court proceedings.\u201d A motion to establish the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee will today be considered by the Senate. The proposed Terms of Reference, to be considered by the Senate this afternoon, are attached. Question time ends with this: David Littleproud: ... Today I had the honour, this morning, to visit Stanthorpe, in my own electorate, to see a community that has galvanised and put its arm around those who have lost. And I have been able to partner with the Queensland government in increasing our category B payments for freight relief and also concessional loans for repairs of construction and also further freight. This builds on what we have already announced in partnership with the state government, in terms of income of $900 per family instantly, as soon as these fires took base. The Queensland government and the federal government worked hand-in-hand. We made sure that those people who were impacted were not out-of-pocket. We have also got grants available for household goods and for the rebuilding of their properties, and we stand ready, with the Queensland government, when they make further application for assistance. But what was sobering, Mr Speaker, this morning was when I met the assistant commissioner, Megan Stiffler, who ran operations, and a stark reminder of her assessment the night those fires started. They made an assessment that there would be fatalities. The catastrophic nature of the fire that took place around Stanthorpe and Applethorpe meant that there was very little that they thought that they could do, that there would be fatalities. Proudly, because of the meticulous planning of those men and women, both professional and volunteers, had put in place, meant that not one life has been lost. Homes have been lost, and I met a family today. And to the day that they lost their house, it marked 50 years since they emigrated from France to Australia. Yet despite the pain and anguish that they and their family felt, all they were concerned about, all that they were proud about, was that they had a small town community that put their arms around them, and they had firemen and women that stood there with them and tried to protect their homes and their properties. Like Pedro. Pedro is a captain of the rural fire brigade at Stanthorpe, just a knockabout bloke. He and his battalion worked for over 24 hours trying to save their community. Ordinary Australians doing extraordinary things. We should be proud of the fact that, in these darkest days, in these darkest days, average Australians become great Australians. Anthony Albanese: I do want to associate Labor with the remarks of the minister, congratulate him on the nature of those remarks, but more importantly, on behalf of our side, join with your side of the house in congratulating all those men and women, whether they be paid, but particularly those volunteers, who are going out there and helping their fellow Australians at this difficult time. Bob Katter is next and I don\u2019t know what to tell you. He talks about chain gangs and Queensland\u2019s \u201cworst ever leaders\u201d (which is hilarious, given he was part of the Joh Bjelke-Petersen government) and something about infrastructure. Josh Frydenberg says things are being built. Let\u2019s all just be pleased that Katter made it to the correct chair today. Someone misses the time to jump for the question and Anthony Albanese gets in there first. Tony Smith says he has repeatedly warned the chamber that this is the practice \u2013 miss the jump and who gets there first gets it. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister accept that a combination of deep cuts and the government\u2019s deregulation obsession have left older Australians in care vulnerable to abuse and neglect? Why is the prime minister denying basic facts, failing to be upfront and failing to take responsibility in the seventh year of the third term of this government, even for the most vulnerable Australians? Morrison: I don\u2019t accept the leader of the opposition\u2019s characterisation of this matter at all. Mr Speaker, as I responded earlier in answer to a question, the reason we initiated, I initiated, the royal commission into aged care, Mr Speaker, is because I wanted to know, and I wanted to... I wanted to ensure that those making the most difficult decision, of putting others into care, whether it is a husband or wife... (there are interjections). ... Mr Speaker, I am endeavouring to answer the question, and those opposite seeking to just frankly not show the courtesy to which this issue deserves respect, Mr Speaker. I have been asked the question. ... And I am answering the question earnestly on a very serious issue, and I would ask them to calm themselves... ... Thank you, Mr Speaker, so no, I don\u2019t accept the leader of the opposition\u2019s characterisation of this matter. It is why the government increases funding for aged care every single year. It is why, Mr Speaker, the government wants to ensure that the results of this royal commission are fully implemented, Mr Speaker, as we work through the issues that are raised, and will ensure that we get to the bottom of the care issues that are so central. Now, Mr Speaker, I am going to respect and trust the work of the royal commission that I initiated, and I would ask those opposite to adopt a similar position. Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: What is the prime minister\u2019s response to the royal commission into aged care that says the accreditation system does not adequately ensure good quality of care and quality of life for residents of aged care facilities and government regulatory approach leaves those people the system is intended to protect. Greg Hunt takes this one: These are very important questions. They go to the reason why we did call the royal commission, as the prime minister indicated, the commission would have stories that would shock Australians. I would give the context that the commission followed the Oakden tragedy and crisis in South Australia. The South Australia state-run facility, which led to some of the most shocking scenes in aged care and institutional care in Australian history, that is why the prime minister called this. In addition to the commission itself, and we urge them to continue their work and go fearlessly with their work, and I have to say the commission has done that so far. As the prime minister said at the time, we continue to get on with the job of regulating and safeguarding Australians while the commission carries out its work. That is why we appointed the aged care quality commissioner. She has been inspecting around the country, her and her team, the aged care quality and safety commissioner have at the same time as the royal commission been going on, inspecting, and where breaches have been found, calling out and highlighting inadequacies. We do this for the reason we believe every Australian in aged care deserves to be protected, supported and deserves to have their safety guarded each and every day. In addition to that, in relation to Earle Haven, the minister, Senator Colby, appointed Kate Carnell to conduct an inquiry, the Carnell inquiry is going on as we speak. I would also note, one of the proprietors, Mr Miller, has failed to appear before an inquiry. I would encourage Mr Miller to appear before all inquiries as soon as he is fit to do so. I have to say, there can be no excuse for any of the proprietors not to appear before the relevant inquiries, whether it is the Queensland state parliament, the royal commission or the aged care quality and safety commissioner. My message to Mr Miller is, appear before the inquiry, fulfil your duty, explain your failures, apologise for your failures and stand up and be counted for the failures on your watch, in your time. Labor has been asking the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, how many senior Australians are waiting for home care packages, then constantly objecting on the grounds of relevance when he talks around the issue rather than supplying a number. The Australian Conservatives senator Cory Bernardi then stood up to complain that Labor senators were objecting \u201cjust to get on TV\u201d *waves*. This is vintage Bernardi, half defence of Coalition senators, half trolling to get on TV himself. Most in the chamber laugh warmly, the wave has a naughty schoolboy charm about it. Colbeck eventually answers that 119,000 people are still waiting for home care packages (slightly lower than the 129,000 suggested by Labor\u2019s Helen Polley), but most Labor senators were heckling too loudly to hear he\u2019d finally answered. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: The royal commission into aged care has heard in the weeks before Bellhaven suddenly closed the government knew that 50% of residents were regularly physically restrained and 71% were chemically restrained. Does he agree with the commission, this knowledge should have raised alarm bells, that there should have been a clinical team down there the next day? Does he agree this was a profound failure of the government regulatory system? Morrison: When I initiated the royal commission into aged care, the reason I did so was because I wanted to know, and I wanted to make sure all Australians had the light shone on our aged care system, and to identify whatever failings that were there, and whatever horror stories that were there. I told Australians at the time they needed to be prepared for difficult information to come back from the commission. What I propose to do is to let the royal commission do its job, compile its evidence, prepare its recommendations. There will be an interim report handed down shortly, we will deal with any response required at that time. We will deal... we... initiated [the commission] to be able to look into these matters and report to the government, so the government can take the action as we should, and as we will. From the 2014 Weekend Australian feature on Kevin Andrews \u2013 who will be leading the inquiry into the family court reform: He even penned a book, Maybe \u2018I Do\u2019 \u2013 Modern Marriage and the Pursuit of Happiness, a 480-page ode to marriage, in which he says that the greatest threat facing the western world is not climate change or radical Islam, but the \u201ccontinuing breakdown of the essential structures of civil society \u2013 marriage, family and community\u201d. Ged Kearney to Scott Morrison: How many registered aged care facilities do not have a registered nurse on site, 24 hours a day? The prime minister takes it on notice. Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: Why are they now 129,000 older Australians waiting for their home care package, even though the packages have been approved? Morrison: I refer the member to the previous answer from both myself and the minister for health, and I will state again that this is one of the biggest priorities of increasing the numbers of in-home aged care places for my government. And we will continue to make gains in this area, and I look forward to the future statements of the government, to build on those statements that we have already made, which have increased the number of places, particularly for those on level four packages. And the reason you can do that, Mr Speaker, is because you manage a strong budget and you can keep adding places. But I do pick up the point that the minister for health made, that at the last election, despite $387bn of higher taxes, they could not find $1 extra to create one extra in-home aged care place, Mr Speaker. $387bn of higher taxes, and even then they couldn\u2019t fund these essential services. Yet on our side of the house, we\u2019ve been increasing those places for in-home aged care by getting the budget in order, by ensuring that we control what we spend, so we can spend it on the priorities. And one of my government\u2019s priorities, and big priorities, Mr Speaker, is to ensure that we deliver even more in-home aged care places to deal with this issue. And if the health minister would like to add, he should feel free to do so. He does feel so. Greg Hunt: I am also delighted to inform the house that in fact there has been a 7% reduction in waiting lists in the last three months alone. In the last three months, a 7% reduction, and that follows from a [inaudible] increase in the last year. So those two things are directly related. An increase in home care places because the budget can afford it, a decrease in those waiting times of 7%, and waiting lists of 7%, which we are informing the house of just today. Tanya Plibersek tries a point of order which includes pointing out a Labor policy (just to get it into the record). She is warned. Dan Tehan becomes the latest government MP to point out the Coalition won the election. Someone is very happy: And the chair is known for this: Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm that last financial year, 16,000 older Australians died while waiting for their approved home care package? Morrison: One of the biggest challenges facing this country and its budget in the future is funding the provision of in-home aged care services. In recent budgets we have increased the number of places by over 20,000 and I will ask the health minister to come and add further to this answer. But the reason that more Australians are choosing to receive that care at home is because they want the choice to do that. And this is an important choice, to be able to stay at home and receive the care that they want to do amongst their loved ones, to be able to spend birthdays and family gatherings together at their home. And that\u2019s why our top priority when it comes to aged care is increasing the number of in-home aged care places, which we are doing, Mr Speaker. Now the only way you can do that, Mr Speaker, the only way to do that, Mr Speaker, is by ensuring you maintain a strong budget. And that\u2019s what you must do, and that\u2019s what our government is doing, Mr Speaker. When you can manage money, you can look those in the eye who are looking for those in-home aged care places, you can tell them that the number of in-home aged care places is increasing, as it is under this government, and you can promise to deliver on that because you know how to manage money. I will ask the minister for health to add to the answer. Greg Hunt: I can confirm that the latest figures, available only today, are an advance on what I provided in considerable detail last week. Last week I informed the house that we had increased from 60,000 home care passages when we came to government to a projected 124,000 packages for the last financial year. In fact, the figures available just today are 125,000, for an increase of over 25,000 places and 25% in one year. That is potentially one of the largest increases in home care places, both in terms of raw numbers and in percentage in Australian history. In addition to that, what I can also say is that we are now projected to increase to 157,000 places by 2022-23. So that is a 161% increase in home care places on our watch, in our time. I can also inform the house that when one views the ALP\u2019s alternative budget, as they seek to be an alternative government, there was zero funding. The Greens senator Larissa Waters has asked a flurry of questions about the Great Barrier Reef, including specifically why two LNP senators (McDonald and McGrath) have proposed setting up an inquiry into whether water quality harms the reef \u2013 seemingly inspired by Peter Ridd. She pointed to the fact the former chief scientist Ian Chubb had described the tactics of casting doubt on reef science employed by Ridd as akin to the tobacco industry\u2019s lobbying against smoking bans. The Liberal leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, replies that the Coalition \u201care absolutely committed to the health of the Great Barrier Reef\u201d, and said that Queensland farmers also \u201cdeeply care\u201d about it. He thanked McGrath for the initiative of the proposed reef inquiry, suggesting it was \u201can opportunity to do even better protecting the Great Barrier Reef into the future\u201d so the Greens should support it too. You may have noticed a couple of patterns here \u2013 Labor on cuts and the government sticking to \u2018look at how well we have managed the economy\u2019. That\u2019s because Josh Frydenberg will be releasing the final budget outcome statement this week (probably tomorrow), which is expected to show a balanced (operating) budget. Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: Why has the prime minister denied cutting $1.2bn from aged care when that is exactly what he did in his 2016-2017 budget? Morrison: Mr Speaker, this is on a repeat cycle. We dealt with these matters before the last election, we made it very clear, in the budget we have been handing down there has been increasing funding for aged care by a year. That may be of no interest to the member who asked a question to check on the facts. One thing I have learned from this opposition, whenever they come to this dispatch box and start spurting these allegations and false claims around, you can never take them at their word. Collins goes to table the last budget, so she can say \u2018which shows the cut\u2019 but she isn\u2019t overly practised at this, and doesn\u2019t get the line onto the record. Vince Connelly does his best Christian Porter to deliver the \u2018can Peter Dutton tell us how safe we are\u2019 lickspittle. We are in luck. Dutton is very happy to answer this question. YOU ARE VERY SAFE \u2013 but just IMAGINE if Labor were in power! Also, there are three million people who could want to swamp our borders, or something, so lucky they are so strong. Michelle Rowland to Paul Fletcher: I refer to the text relay service part of the national relay service helping senior Australians who are deaf to make and receive telephone calls. Why is the government removing access to the handset from the national relay service? Fletcher: The national relay service is a very important communication service for Australians who are deaf or hearing impaired or have a speech impediment. Indeed we have committed to spend $22m a year to deliver the national relay service so that people who have hearing impairment or speech difficulties are able to use the telephone system. It is very important that we are getting good value for money for taxpayers. That\u2019s why we recently have gone through a competitive document process, under which the incumbent, Ace (Australian Communication Exchange), had the opportunity to bid, to retain the contract. The result, they did not retain the contract, it has been awarded to a new company, Concentra X, that will continue the national relay service commencing from February 1 2020. It follows a competitive selection process designed to get the best possible outcome for Australians who need to use the national relay service. Indeed the Concentra service will offer new options which are not available under the current arrangement, including the ability to receive texts over iPads, tablets and smart phones. I want to make it very clear, Mr Speaker, the Morrison government is technology agnostic about services provided through the national relay service. At the moment the position is the owner of the existing proprietary tel system has cited an exclusive agreement and has declined to provide it. Should they be interested in providing to existing recipients of the service, we would be happy to speak to them about that. I do want to make it absolutely clear there is no threat to the national relay service, it will be maintained, there will continue to be a provision of technology, indeed new technology options, under which people who are hearing impaired or speech impaired can view text, so that what was spoken by the person on the other end of the phone is converted to text which they will be able to view. The national relay service is very important and it is continuing. Josh Frydenberg seems to have forgotten how microphones work again. The free dictionary.com can help him out \u2013 \u201can instrument capable of transforming sound waves into changes in electric currents or voltage, used in recording or transmitting sound\u201d. Which is why you don\u2019t have to yell into it. Bill Shorten has put out his official press release on the robo-debt class action: Thalidomide. Big Tobacco. Asbestos. And now: Robodebt. Today we are happy to announce that, following conversations with myself, Gordon Legal intends to launch a class action on behalf of victims of the harsh and inaccurate robodebt scheme. ... Since becoming the Shadow Minister for Government Services I have formed the view that the toxic robodebt scheme, put in place in mid-2016, is built on shaky legal foundations. The Government has used a flawed calculation system to unlawfully take back millions of dollars from pensioners. The Federal Government has financially benefited by wrongfully taking and banking money that legitimately belonged to recipients. The robodebt scheme \u2013 including its reverse onus of proof \u2013 is at best legally dubious and should rightly have its legality determined by a court. Other legal actions by robodebt victims have invariably resulted in the Government entirely waiving or dramatically reducing the claimed debt, and settling the action. But the individual nature of the actions has meant the legality of robodebt generally has not been tested. In this action lawyers for robodebt victims will argue that the Commonwealth has been unjustly enriched by amounts of money it has falsely recouped from recipients of inaccurate debt compliance notices. Labor supports legitimate debt recovery and data matching provided it has proper human oversight. Robodebt is none of these things. \u201cMinister Stuart Robert admits an error rate of at least one-in-five. Insiders know it is malfunctioning and are covering it up because the Government wants the revenue apparently at any cost,\u201d Mr Shorten said. \u201cThe victims of robodebt need their day in court so it can be determined whether what appears to be a bureaucratic standover racket has any proper legal foundation whatsoever.\u201d \u201cStress, heartbreak, suicides \u2013 this is the trail of carnage that robodebt has wrought. ... Gordon Legal are in discussions with several robodebt victims who could be plaintiffs in the planned action. Others who have had legitimate Centrelink benefits illegally clawed back with an interest in the action can register their details on the Gordon Legal website. Michael McCormack has just had to tell the parliament that there was an election, and \u201cwe won\u201d. The gluten-free toast I had for dinner last night had more substance. Labor has started question time in the Senate by asking Anne Ruston how many of the Coalition\u2019s budgets since 2014 have cut the pension. Ruston started to answer the question but Labor objected on the grounds of relevance, leading the Liberal leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, to respond that pensions go up twice a year. Penny Wong suggested he felt the need to intervene to help a \u201cweak minister\u201d. The supplementary is about how many times the Coalition has tried to increase the pension age to 70. When Ruston responds again by explaining the amount of the pension goes up twice yearly, Wong heckles \u201cyou\u2019re congratulating yourself for inflation\u201d. \u201cWe are the government that backs older Australians, it doesn\u2019t tax older Australians,\u201d Ruston replies. Andrew Giles to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. Does this bill, the amendment and integrity bill, which is in the House right now, make cuts to the pension supplement? (That would be the one that requires proof of life.) Morrison: (who has absolutely donned the cranky pants again today) I will ask the minister representing the minister for services to add to my answer, Mr Speaker, but I can tell you, Mr Speaker, what this government does. This government make sure that the welfare system is fair to those who rely on it and it is fair to those who pay for it, Mr Speaker, which is the taxpayers of Australia. And where there are benefits and supplements to payments that are being paid to people who are having extended absences from Australia, so they are overseas for long periods at a time, and they receive supplements to meet expenditures that people are facing at home, Mr Speaker, not overseas, and the government will always seek to ensure that these supplements go to those for the purposes they were intended. Mr Speaker, under our government, the welfare bill is not a blank cheque. Under our government, welfare goes where it is needed and it is targeted and it is done in a sustainable way, to ensure that all of those who rely absolutely on the welfare bill, Mr Speaker, of this country can depend on it in the future. And you know what, Mr Speaker? If you can\u2019t manage money, if you are a government that doesn\u2019t know how to manage money, you can\u2019t say to the pensioners of Australia that you will support their pension into the future. Under the Labor party, they had to miss medicines, Mr Speaker, they had to endure cuts to defence, they had to put a flood levy on, Mr Speaker, because they did not know how to manage money. The Labor party has to take responsibility for the implications for the consequences, Mr Speaker, of their failure to manage money. At the last election, we said very clearly Labor can\u2019t manage money, and that means they come after yours. They will ensure, Mr Speaker, through their mismanagement, that Australians miss out, that essential services that Australians rely on can never be guaranteed by the Labor party, whether it is hospitals or schools or the NDIS or aged care. And they can bark and shout all they like, Mr Speaker, but the truth is, Labor can\u2019t manage money. ... I am asked about the pension. And I will tell you what I won\u2019t do. We won\u2019t take away the imputation credits, Mr Speaker, for pensioners who simply want to manage their own money, Mr Speaker. At the last election, the Australian people know that Labor were coming after older Australians\u2019 money, and they said no to Labor. (So that is a yes then \u2013 there are cuts to the supplement. But those who have franking credits \u2013 a bill which is soon to cost more than what we spend on education \u2013 are totally fine.) Michael McCormack continues his stirling lickspittle performance, by picking up on the words \u201cstability and certainty\u201d on the same day the NSW Liberal MPs announced and then cancelled a spill against a leader who won an election just six months ago. Honestly. I can see light bending round him. Maria Vamvakinou to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm how many pensioners will be negatively impacted by his legislation to cut the pension supplement? Paul Fletcher gets up: \u201c... As the prime minister said, pensions are regularly indexed and under this government the amount of money that goes to pensions, those on the age pension, has increased significantly since we have been in government. And our commitment, our commitment, is to a sustainable social services system. Our commitment is to a sustainable social services system, because under the previous government, under the previous Labor government, the challenge that we faced was that the social services system was not sustainable, Mr Speaker. The social services system was not sustainable, and we are determined to make sure that it is sustainable, so that the rate of growth of social services is [no] greater than the growth of tax revenue. Tony Burke: On direct relevance, the question asks for the number of pensioners who would be negatively impacted by that legislation. Relevant comments such as 175,000 are not being made by the minister. Fletcher has concluded his answer. Phil Thompson, who cannot be trusted for the simple reason he thinks that tomato sauce belongs on a bacon and egg roll (instead of hot sauce or bbq sauce) delivers the first lickspittle question, which is on defence spending. Because that is on the mind of every single constituent in Herbert. Apparently. Linda Burney to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm that since 2014 every government budget has included cuts to the pension? Morrison: Mr Speaker, as the member would know, the pension, along with all indexed payments, increases twice each year, in March and September. The budget has gone up every single year. (The budget has gone up because more people are reaching pension age. It\u2019s like health and education spending \u2013 as long as the population grows, those budgets increase. What he is talking about is indexation, which, as anyone who has knowledge of it knows, is nothing.) Pauline Hanson is holding a press conference after Senate question time at 3.30 to talk about the family court review. It\u2019s the downhill slide to question time. Hit me up with your predictions. Scott Morrison has told MPs that a new review of the family court system will \u201cnot take sides\u201d but will hear from affected families about how the system can be improved. According to a spokesman, the PM told MPs the committee had been established because of the challenges that family breakdowns can create, including contributing to issues such as suicide and poverty. Morrison said that keeping families together was essential where possible. He also said that the terms of reference would be established in collaboration with Labor. \u201cThe prime minister stressed that this inquiry isn\u2019t about taking any sides,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThere are blokes who are victims, there are women who are victims, and most tragically there are children who are victims. \u201cAbout nine MPs spoke in favour of the inquiry. The prime minister also thanked MPs for standing by embattled MP Gladys Liu, saying it was clear she also had the support of the community. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told MPs that the final budget outcome to be released in coming days would show a \u201csubstantial improvement\u201d on budget forecasts. Pauline Hanson will most likely be the deputy chair of that family law inquiry. Gordon Legal has put out its official statement on the class action: The law firm will challenge, on behalf of affected persons, the government\u2019s use of a flawed calculation system by Centrelink to unlawfully take back tens of millions of dollars from many thousands of Centrelink recipients, including pensioners. The money for pensioners, carers, widows, students, farmers and unemployed people was taken from them due to a one-size-fits-all online compliance system. The robodebt scheme has been in place since mid-2016, its legality was first raised with us by the new shadow minister for government services, Bill Shorten. The basis for the challenge is that that the federal government financially benefited when it wrongfully took and banked money that legitimately belonged to recipients. Gordon Legal Senior Partner Peter Gordon says \u2018investigations reveal between two to three hundred million dollars have been wrongly taken from people, and making it even worse was many were hit with penalties of 10% on those amounts.\u2019 \u2018These people are the least able groups to afford the heavy-handed actions which are based on a system that used ATO averages that didn\u2019t take into account individual circumstances.\u2019 \u2018The unfair and incorrect assumptions had a devastating financial impact on people\u2019s lives. The emotional distress for people who have done nothing wrong has been high.\u2019 \u2018The robodebt system put debt collectors onto innocent people to chase unlawful debts.\u2019 \u2018They have been unfairly financially disadvantaged and must be repaid with interest, penalties dropped and damages paid.\u2019 \u2018The amounts owed will vary from case to case but the average repayments could be a few thousand dollars which is vital from a financial and wellbeing perspective for these people who are least able to afford it.\u2019 Peter Gordon says \u2018The people in this class action were not gaming the system. They had honest claims to payments and allowances that Robodebt wrongly assessed, penalised and pursued with harsh consequences.\u2019 \u2018If you have been unfairly affected by Robodebt, you should register your details on the Gordon Legal website and we will be in touch.\u2019 Gordon Legal considers a class action is likely to be the best way to deliver redress for people unfairly impacted by Robodebt. Larissa Waters has responded to that motion that Paul Karp wrote about a few posts ago: After years of the government denying climate science and saying water quality, not climate, is the biggest threat to the Reef, now it is proposing an inquiry into whether water quality really is a problem for the Reef. This government is at war with science and the Reef will suffer for it. The Greens are urging the crossbench to stand with the Greens and Labor to block this inquiry from proceeding, not to give succour to the latest culture war against science by dinosaur backbenchers. This inquiry would be like inquiring into whether smoking causes lung cancer \u2013 a total waste of the Parliament\u2019s time. Climate denial and a lack of climate action has already seen the outlook for the Great Barrier Reef deteriorate from \u2018poor\u2019 to \u2018very poor\u2019 on the Federal Government\u2019s watch. Now two Queensland LNP Senators are proposing an inquiry in an attempt to deny the evidence that inappropriate farming practices contribute to the stress on our already fragile Reef. The government is overrun with science deniers, who without any relevant qualifications are calling into question the validity of science - to suit the agenda of big donors and vested interests. Former Chief Scientist and now chair of the Reef 2050 Independent Expert Panel Professor Ian Chubb has already sent a strongly worded letter to relevant Government Ministers confirming the absolute clarity of the peer-reviewed science about the Reef [1] Peer-reviewed science should not be debated by non-scientifically trained politicians who are in the pocket of their donors. The science is clear, we must act now for our best chance to protect the Reef and the more than 65,000 tourism jobs that rely on it. We need urgent climate action, an end to coal and a just transition towards renewable energy, and strong action on water quality and Crown of Thorns to save what\u2019s left of our Reef. Bill Shorten: The government keeps reaching for blaming Labor pre-2013. Robodebt, this online compliance system, was introduced by the current government. The current government announced compliance campaigns in 2015, 2016, and they started introducing robodebt, their use of an algorithm to data match. It was born under this government and the pathology of robodebt is sick, it has caused countless harm. I give a shoutout to the media, you\u2019ve all covered the problems of robodebt, but at what point in Australia do you say once you\u2019ve seen individual case after individual case it is called a pattern, and the pattern shows robodebt is immoral itself. What we and Gordon Legal is going to do is testing the legal foundations of robodebt, because my own research in the last couple of months has led me to believe it is almost certainly illegal and I just have to do research through the stories you\u2019ve covered to say there is a sickness at the heart of robodebt which needs to be cured. Bill Shorten: Let\u2019s be clear, we\u2019ve asked the government to fix this, but they\u2019ve got it wrong. If the government through parliament won\u2019t fix the problem, I think giving justice to victims through class action is a legitimate political approach to take. Question: Should the program then in your view be suspended while this class action is even being looked at? Bill Shorten: That would be smart for them to suspend it. The question you have to ask is why is the government looking at a blanket scheme looking at annual wages data against people getting fortnightly payments? They are hoping they can shake down people into paying up. This is a government building their government position based on this faulty, immoral and quite possibly illegal scheme, but they should suspend it and rule out extending it to anyone else, and in fact they should revisit their own files and perhaps sit down and work out why this is wrong and stop it. Peter Gordon: Everyone who believes they are aggrieved is entitled to bring their own actions, whether they are in the [program] or as appropriately advised. We are working with the legal aid agencies, but it doesn\u2019t take, I think, a lot of consideration of what has happened to understand that if a template approach has been applied across 800,000 people, and there are admittedly, on the part of the government, 150,000 errors that have been made, that\u2019s a very large number of mistakes which have been made. If they\u2019ve been made, there is a limit to the ability of any court system and indeed bureaucracy to take them off one by one. We think it\u2019s appropriate that if there are common issues that have been got wrong by the commonwealth, that they be addressed in a way that gives everyone release, not just those who are able to access lawyers and legal aid or have the wherewithal all the records to be able to do it themselves. Peter Gordon: In order for a class action to proceed, either in a state court or the federal jurisdiction, you need to demonstrate that there appear to be several more people who have claims with similar or the same common issues in the fact of law, and there are clearly a large number of people who have similar issues of fact and of law. So the question of its status as a class action is not particularly controversial. Under class-action law, not every case needs to be exactly the same. They only have to be roughly similar. Not every case needs to be bound to succeed. You simply need to demonstrate that there are cases that have similar issues that the court can resolve for the benefit of everybody. Peter Gordon: The class action element of the claim is reasonably straightforward. What is innovative about this is to bring a claim against the government for damages for unjust enrichment that will require the high court to recognise legal principles, which I hardly recognised in other common law countries, particularly the United Kingdom. It may break new ground. We think there \u2026 is a strong legal basis for it. Bill Shorten, standing next to Peter Gordon, has announced a class action into robodebt recovery. More to come Senator Susan McDonald has had to reschedule a planned appearance with Dr Peter Ridd and the Green Shirts Movement at an event intending to lobby against the Queensland Labor government\u2019s environmental regulations, which they claim are \u201canti-farming\u201d. McDonald and James McGrath have a Senate motion attempting to set up an inquiry into the issue \u2013 and it looks like the LNP senators are seeking to find support for Ridd\u2019s controversial claim that farmland pollution does not significantly damage the Great Barrier Reef. Ridd has been on a speaking tour, supported by rightwing commentators and sugarcane industry managers, campaigning against proposed state regulations limiting sediment and chemical runoff on the reef coast. An expert panel led by the former chief scientist, Ian Chubb, has warned that Ridd is misrepresenting robust science about the plight of the Great Barrier Reef. The full text of the motion is: To move \u2014 that the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 1 October 2020: The identification of leading practices in ensuring evidence-based regulation of farm practices that impact water quality outcomes in the Great Barrier Reef, with particular reference to: (a) the existing evidence-base on the impact of farm water runoff on the health of the Great Barrier Reef and catchment areas; (b) the connectivity of farm practices throughout the Great Barrier Reef catchment areas to water quality outcomes in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; (c) relevant legislation and regulation, including in relation to impacts of water quality, farm management and soil runoff; (d) proposed changes to regulations that would impact on farm productivity and the potential benefits and costs of such proposed regulation; (e) the wider economic and social impact of proposed regulations to restrict farm practices; and (f) any related matters. AAP reports: Elderly Australian pensioners living overseas will have to prove they\u2019re alive every two years or risk having payments cut off. People aged over 80 claiming the pension abroad will have to provide a proof-of-life certificate, after legislation passed parliament on Tuesday. If no certificate is produced within 13 weeks of the due date, payments will be suspended. After 26 weeks the pension will be stopped. The federal government is expecting to net $219 million over four years through about 6,000 cases of pensions being paid to dead people. \u2018This will confirm that Australian pensions are only being paid to pensioners who still are alive,\u2019 social services minister Anne Ruston told parliament. She said the government was not suggesting widespread fraud was being committed, rather that family members didn\u2019t know they had to tell the government about pensioners dying. Pension recipients would have the opportunity to have the payment reinstated with the full amount paid back if a certificate is provided later. The change is expected to affect 25,000 pensioners living overseas when it takes effect on October 1. It was 25C yesterday: Kevin Andrews is to chair an inquiry into the family court system. This is alternatively known as \u2018giving Pauline Hanson a bone\u2019.* *As in, for the person who emailed me, Pauline Hanson has been pushing for family law reform for some time, has a private members\u2019 bill in the Senate on it, while One Nation have done MPIs on this topic, and now, as One Nation\u2019s Senate vote becomes important, the government is throwing a bone, in the form of an inquiry, their way. And I said Pauline Hanson and not just One Nation, because this has been Hanson\u2019s personal issue for some time, from even before she was back in parliament, and would attend Queensland parliament community cabinet meetings to talk about it in regional areas. Labor MPs have resolved to negotiate with the government on a host of legislation, including changes to the Crimes Act that put in place mandatory sentencing for child sex crimes. The opposition has reaffirmed its opposition to mandatory sentencing on the basis that it has not been proven to be effective and can make it more difficult to prosecute. But MPs will not vote against the legislation if it comes to a vote before the legal and constitutional affairs committee reports back on the bill. Shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus will prepare a second submission on the issue for MPs to consider before the party decides its final position. Labor MPs have agreed to oppose a government push to drug test welfare recipients and will seek \u201csubstantial amendments\u201d to the cashless welfare card expansion, which extends the card into the NT and Cape York. It will oppose the bill in its current form. On government changes to the character test that will make it easier to deport people who commit crimes while in Australia on a visa, Labor will write to immigration minister David Coleman offering conditional support, wanting changes to address \u201cunintended and undesirable consequences\u201d. Addressing MPs, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the weekend just passed had been a \u201cturning point\u201d for the government after it had been on a victory lap. He said the discipline within the Labor caucus had allowed the opposition to hold Morrison to account for denying he had used the term \u201cShanghai Sam\u201d. Here is a bit more from last Thursday\u2019s MPI that Murph was talking about. Bill Shorten: We say today that robodebt is both unlawful and unethical in the way that it seeks to recover debts from people, by requiring supposed debtors to disprove a data-matched debt. It should be Centrelink who makes the case. Leaving aside all the humour of having the member for Fadden as the minister, there\u2019s a serious issue here. How is it the case that in 2019 individual Australians can receive a letter of demand from the government and, immediately upon receipt of the letter of demand, it is the recipient of the letter, the Australian citizen, who then has to argue with the might of the Australian government to say the debt is not correct? We put very clearly here today that the onus of proof for these debts lies with the government, that the sheer process of an algorithm data-matching annual ATO data with fortnightly payments paid by the Department of Human Services does not discharge the obligation of the government to a satisfactory level. It is not enough to rely on a robotic letter of demand, with no proof and no supporting material, and simply reverse the onus of proof on Australian citizens. It is not the job of the government of Australia to oppress individual citizens. That is not the role of the state. The onus rests with the government. When there is a serious allegation saying that you owe the government money, I would put that the burden is even greater than just the data-matching process, because consequences flow from saying to a citizen that they owe the government money. You get the private debt collectors on to you. If you have a finding of debt, you can\u2019t get finance. If you\u2019re a law student with a debt finding, you can\u2019t be admitted as a lawyer. There are consequences from the government\u2019s assertion that the individual owes a debt with no supporting evidence. There are consequences of that which make it more grave and more severe. And because of the severity of the consequences of a finding of debt it increases the obligation upon the government to prove the system. There is no lawful basis for the government to just assert debt on the part of citizens with a cursory algorithm and data matching and then say it\u2019s up to the citizen. But this is not just a question of whether or not it is lawful; it is also immoral. Robodebt causes hardship. It causes stress. This flawed, inaccurate data, where people are required to pay a debt when it is not clear how the debt is constituted, leaves individuals stranded. The process for appealing these debts is inadequate. In closing, not only is the system unlawful, not only is it immoral, along with the consequences and the stresses it has, but we are seeing a calculated strategy of cover-up by the government. That media event from Bill Shorten looks interesting. Last week, in a little-noticed matter of public importance debate, Shorten flagged concern that robodebt might be unlawful. \u201cThere is no lawful basis for the government to just assert debt on the part of citizens with a cursory algorithm and data matching and then say it\u2019s up to the citizen,\u201d Shorten said. He went on to say: \u201cBut this is not just a question of whether or not it is lawful; it is also immoral.\u201d Given today\u2019s event is with Peter Gordon, I\u2019d say he\u2019s going to expand on that theme. The bells are ringing for the official start of the parliament session. Bill Shorten has announced a press conference for 1pm with \u201cGordon Legal Senior Partner Peter Gordon, and will be making an announcement on robodebt\u201d. This is the official release on that: Minister for drought David Littleproud announced the Future Drought Fund Consultative Committee as an important milestone in taking action on drought. The committee will now develop the drought resilience funding plan for the fund, which begins with a $3.9bn credit that will grow to $5bn. ... chair, Mr Brent Finlay, and committee members Dr Kate Andrews, Dr Wendy Craik AM, Dr Elizabeth Peterson and Ms Caroline Welsh will begin their work in Canberra later this month. This in from David Littleproud, who was in Queensland for a press conference with James McGrath two seconds ago. He was looking at the fire damage in Stanthorpe. He\u2019ll be back for question time, but he had this to say about the drought package the government is looking to put together: If we don\u2019t put the right governance around this, it will be politically attacked. We do not want that. We want this to continue on in a bipartisan approach for governments in perpetuity. It is important we get this right. The plan that the panel will bring back to me will, in fact, sit on the parliament table and is a disallowable instrument. In fact, the parliament itself can disagree with the panel, but they are independent of myself and the government. We expect them to come back with a plan that strikes to the heart of resilience and building a resilience in communities in the agricultural sector. That is what they have been charged with. They are the ones with the skill set. It is then my job to make sure that the Australian parliament respects that and we deliver it.\u201d The Coalition party room meeting looks to have broken, given the line at Aussies (the parliamentary cafe. Yes we pay for our food and drink). We\u2019ll have some idea of what went on for you very soon. Business, business, business: The US Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Global Innovation Policy Center (GIPC) will lead a senior US delegation to Australia this week to meet with Australian government and parliamentary decision-makers. Based in Washington DC, the US Chamber of Commerce is the world\u2019s largest business federation representing the interests of more than three million business of all sizes, sectors and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations. The delegation, comprised of representatives from the US Chamber of Commerce\u2019s member companies, is in Australia as part of the GIPC\u2019s efforts to champion innovation and creativity through enhanced intellectual property standards around the world. The group chats, however, would be another story. Given the discussion we have had this week about business and advocacy campaigns \u2013 not to mention CEO pay \u2013 this National Press Club address being held tomorrow should be interesting. Alan Joyce and Paul Scurrah CEO, Qantas Group and CEO, Virgin Australia Group\u2019 The Great Australian Monopoly: Where nobody wins but the airports. See? Absolutely every family, Every \u201cfamily\u201d has their disagreements. From Paul Karp: The Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, has called on Australia to be \u201cfar more ambitious\u201d in reducing greenhouse gases, linking the climate crisis to extreme weather events in the Pacific including drought and bushfires in Australia. On the final official day of his visit to Australia, Bainimarama nominated the \u201cvaried level of ambition when it comes to confronting the threat of climate change\u201d as a key difference between the two countries and called for everyone to \u201cunite behind the science\u201d of limiting global heating to 1.5C. Bainimarama\u2019s visit follows his heavy criticism of Scott Morrison at the Pacific Islands Forum, where he said the Australian prime minister had insulted and alienated Pacific leaders over his failure to back stronger emissions targets. It is spring. This is ridiculous Here is Jennifer Westacott from the Business Council of Australia, talking to Hamish McDonald on RN this morning, about why the business council is against the \u201cbig stick\u201d energy legislation: We still oppose them. We still believe all the risks exist in terms of deterring investment and that\u2019s what we really need in this country. We need investment in our existing system. We need investment in new parts of the energy market. We think it will deter it. We think it is a highly risky piece of legislation and we think it\u2019s unnecessary. You\u2019ve got the competition regulator yesterday announcing that for 800,000 small businesses and households prices have gone down. And this legislation will not put downward pressure on prices. So, look you know, the government took it to an election. They\u2019ve got a mandate to do it. What we\u2019re trying to do is to work constructively with them to get the legislation in better shape, to make sure it doesn\u2019t have these unintended consequences. And we\u2019ve worked very hard on that and so we are hoping the government takes our suggested amendments very seriously. HM: What\u2019s the evidence that it will affect investment? Well I think you\u2019ve got to look at it from an investor\u2019s point of view. If a government starts actually negotiating contracts on your behalf, if government is interfering in pricing, if there is capacity for a government to actually divest your assets. You know if you\u2019re a company you have to ask yourself are you seriously going to put a lot of your shareholder\u2019s money at risk. That\u2019s the fundamental problem we\u2019ve got. And I think the problem we\u2019ve got with this legislation and always have had is that it will not actually achieve reduction in prices. There are many other things that the competition regulator said could be done. And then the competition regulator has said that this is an extreme measure, this proposed legislation. Now that what was obviously the biggest scandal of the day has been cleared up (her office confirmed we were right). It might be worth noting that we haven\u2019t heard from any senior federal Liberals on the NSW mess. March 24 seems like forever ago: An ebullient prime minister, Scott Morrison, warmed up the crowd before the premier arrived on Saturday night, taking to the stage to declare: \u201cHow good is Gladys Berejiklian and how good is the Liberal party here in NSW?\u201d And here Richard Marles gives us some idea of where Labor is going today: The fact here is that the single biggest factor in terms of where the Australian economy is at, is this government\u2019s failure to manage it over the last six years. And I understand that when people I represent are making really difficult decisions about what they go without, that is about the way in which this government has managed our economy far more than it is global factors which are going on, or not going on, over the last few years. Richard Marles stopped by a doorstop interview after his ABC interview this morning, where he was asked about Donald Trump\u2019s \u201clocked and loaded\u201d tweet (plus, no one in \u201cany history\u201d has ever been this prepared, yadda, yadda). Well, obviously that language causes anxiety. Clearly it does. I think it\u2019s also important to take a moment and just understand firstly that there has been a walking back of that language overnight. But secondly there\u2019s a big difference between language and action. And we\u2019ve seen that in respect of the language of this president in the past, in respect of other conflicts. But I note Josh Frydenberg has pointed to that language, he\u2019s pointing to a whole lot of issues around the world, which I think he\u2019s going to be doing in his speech tonight, about why there is every reason in the world for Australia\u2019s economy at the moment and not the actions of his own government. Let us be clear: we\u2019ve had record low wage growth in this country for the last six years. That predates the events of the last few weeks. No matter where Josh Frydenberg points, at the end of the day I know that people in my electorate are doing it tough and they have been for a long time. They\u2019re having to go and make decisions about what they will not be able to afford on any given night. And the treasurer going out this evening and pointing to every issue in the world other than his own government\u2019s performance is cold comfort for the people I represent. With everyone in party room and caucus at the moment, it might be a chance to have a look at the \u201cbig stick\u201d energy legislation. In that, currently, it doesn\u2019t exist. Not as a final-draft hard-copy bill. So far, it has been discussed through briefings. Which means we won\u2019t have an answer from Labor, because Labor hasn\u2019t seen it. No one has. Including the government backbench committee. So don\u2019t expect too many answers on that today. Samantha Maiden had a story on one of the donations Gladys Liu was connected to, overnight in the New Daily: The mystery of a $105,000 donation linked to Liberal MP Gladys Liu has been solved and it involves her Chinese employer dropping six figures to dine with then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. But in a plot twist, the dinner never occurred and Brighsun, the Chinese-owned company that won the auction, never asked for a refund. Victorian Liberal Party sources have told the New Daily that Ms Liu\u2019s employers still agreed to pay the Liberal party $105,000 \u2013 for nothing. You can read the whole story here. Siri? Show me \u201clack of self-awareness\u201d. Here\u2019s Barnaby Joyce: Now, I respect Gladys Berejiklian. I think she\u2019s a good premier. I think she\u2019s been badly advised and I believe now that the fate of the government rests in the upper house of the New South Wales parliament doing the right thing and properly fixing bad legislation. That\u2019s what they\u2019re paid money to do. Turn your answering machines back on and listen to the people and listen to their issues. They have a right to be heard. And the Senate demand for documents, put forward by Kristina Keneally, has resulted in this report on Paladin from Paul Karp: Offshore detention security contractor Paladin has had to pay back $3.1m to the Australian government for hundreds of breaches of its key performance indicators. Documents produced to the Senate on Monday reveal that from May 2018 to April 2019 the contractor was forced to credit back $3.1m of its $423m contract value and is facing an adverse assessment of $8.1m for the month of July 2018, for which there appeared to be no final outcome yet agreed with the home affairs department. In that month the department assessed that Paladin would owe $5.6m for 928 failures relating to timely delivery of transport services, $1.4m for 592 breaches of entry and egress processes and $973,500 relating to 649 breaches of training and qualifications requirements. Paladin agreed to pay back $753,900 in May 2018, $701,100 in June and $921,900 in August 2018. In the documents Paladin explained the failures by describing its \u201cinability to deploy expat personnel\u201d, but the department found this was no excuse for failure to deliver training to staff and \u201cshould not prevent \u2026 incident reporting, particularly as incident reporting is generally overseen in Australia\u201d. In case you didn\u2019t see it, the latest Guardian Essential poll is out (yes, I know, all the caveats on polling). As Katharine Murphy reports: A majority of Australians either approve of the medevac procedures, or think more needs to be done to protect the health and welfare of asylum seekers offshore, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. While the fortnightly survey of 1,093 respondents finds majority support (52%) for offshore detention, with 25% signalling strong support for Australia\u2019s harsh deterrence framework \u2013 41% of the survey thinks the medevac procedures strike a balance between strong borders and humane treatment for people in offshore detention, and 23% argue the legislation does not go far enough to provide humane treatment for people in offshore detention. The Morrison government wants to repeal the medical evacuation procedures imposed on the Coalition by the crossbench, Labor and the Greens during the period of minority government before the May election. The procedures give clinicians more of a say in whether sick people are transferred from Nauru and Manus Island to Australia for medical treatment. Jacqui Lambie is yet to make her mind up on the bill to repeal medevac. She is the swinging vote in that one. It won\u2019t come up until November, after a parliamentary committee looking into the policy completes its report. There is also no law against stupidity, and so, here we are. The Business Council of Australia head, Jennifer Westacott, is having a chat to Hamish Macdonald on ABC radio \u2013 she is very against the big stick legislation. That\u2019s the one bit of consistency we have with this bill \u2013 the business community don\u2019t like it. Before we move into the theatrics of politics, just a note to say our thoughts and hearts are with the Greens senator Janet Rice, her family and her loved ones, after the death of her wife, Dr Penny Whetton. The only other spill I can think of to be called off this quickly is when rogue Queensland LNP MPs attempted to move against the then-opposition leader, Lawrence Springborg. Turns out there was basically just three of them pushing the motion, although they had handily created several alternative shadow ministry lists they were distributing, which had different names on them, as they attempted to build support. Apparently no one thought their colleagues would compare the lists and discover they were different. But no one can ever talk to me about how insane #qldpol is, ever again. It\u2019s snowing in Canberra. But it\u2019s still not as chilly as the NSW Liberal party room, where, six months after winning an election, and just a year a a bit after their federal colleagues said never again, Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s leadership is under threat. The spill doesn\u2019t look like being successful, given the number of Liberal MPs who rushed to Twitter to give their support to the premier. But it does put the NSW government majority under threat. Because we all know that once these things start, they don\u2019t stop. It\u2019s all over the bill to decriminalise abortion. Barnaby Joyce, who spoke at a rally against the bill (\u201ceveryone here was born\u201d) as well as the federal parliament, and has done his best to gee up his state colleagues, told Sky this morning the spill wasn\u2019t a great idea: Remember it is not so much how many people stand for the spill, you have to look at your majority and say how many in that. If more people move for the spill than you have in a majority, you have a big problem. So my advice, having yes, I have seen a number of these bills, I have seen them up close, I\u2019ve seen how quickly they go from nothing to massive, so now the fate of the premier, who I believe should keep her job \u2013 it won\u2019t matter if you change the premier and the bill still goes through, is in the hands of the upper house members, the MLC of the NSW parliament, and they if they choose to throw her off a cliff, then be it on their heads. The NSW rumbles are a headache the federal government doesn\u2019t want right now. They were quite enjoying the NSW Labor issues and now those are overshadowed. There are more questions over Gladys Liu\u2019s fundraising. Josh Frydenberg is having to warn the business community to stay calm as tensions in the Middle East hit a new flashpoint. And Scott Morrison has to practise walking a middle line before his meetings with Donald Trump, so as not to irk China. As the prime minister would say \u2013 how good is it? Meanwhile, as Katharine Murphy reported, the backbench committee signed off on the big stick energy bill, despite not having seen the actual legislation, after a briefing on the bill, but there remains jitters over what the Senate might do to it. We\u2019ll bring you all of that, and more, as the day unfolds. It\u2019s party room and caucus day, so the morning will be pretty quiet. Lucky that state politics steps into the breach! Mike Bowers is wandering around, and you have Murph, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp on deck, as well as the rest of the Guardian brains trust, keeping an eye on what my caffeinated pupils miss. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

He allegedly shot Zelimkhan Khangoshvili dead from close range in the Kleiner Tiergarten park while the 40-year-old Georgian citizen was on his way to the mosque.

A joint investigation by Der Spiegel, Bellingcat and the Insider found that the passport number used by the suspect could be linked to a unit in Moscow\u2019s interior ministry that in the past has issued documents for the military security service GRU. If further links emerge between the alleged killer and Moscow, the question will be whether Germany makes a major diplomatic incident out of a state-sponsored hit on its soil, similar to the aftermath of the Sergei Skripal poisoning, when Britain rallied western allies to mount a coordinated expulsion of Russian diplomatic staff suspected of spying. So far, signs point to a much more low key investigation, with the case still being handled by the local Berlin prosecutors rather than at the federal level. The Kremlin has denied all involvement. \u201cI categorically reject any link between this incident, this murder and official Russia,\u201d said Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, days after the killing.",

On Tuesday, Labor wrote to Coleman offering to support the bill provided it not apply retrospectively, exempted low-level offences and for special consideration to be given to New Zealanders \u2013 all conditions immediately rejected by the minister. Coleman even made a virtue of the fact the bill would increase the number of visas cancelled, explaining this was \u201cby design\u201d and questioning why critics of the bill said it \u201cas if it were a bad thing\u201d. The Coalition bill seeks to amend the Migration Act to provide grounds for visa cancellation or refusal where a non-citizen has been convicted of a serious crime punishable by two years\u2019 imprisonment, even if a jail term is not imposed. Experts have warned the bill could lead to a fivefold increase in the number of people facing deportation, with residents from New Zealand and humanitarian refugees disproportionately affected. Deportation of New Zealanders who have committed offences in Australia is a major sore point in the relationship, with the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, describing the existing law as \u201ccorrosive\u201d and the NZ high commissioner, Annette King, warning the bill will make \u201ca bad situation worse\u201d.

Keneally also asked the government to amend the bill so that only people sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more can have their visa cancelled. \u201cThe bill currently means a person convicted of low-level offences \u2013 such as assault for grasping a person by the sleeve \u2013 but receiving no sentence could have their visa cancelled.\u201d Coleman told reporters in Canberra it was \u201cvery important\u201d that Labor support the bill, which he claimed \u201cis about protecting Australians from non-citizens who commit serious crimes\u201d.

Some, happily, are no longer with us or have been banished to the dustiest reaches of the corner shop, brands such as Hirondelle, Lutomer Laski Riesling, or Le Piat d\u2019Or, that neither we nor the French adore any more.</p> <p>Others, remodelled, repackaged, occasionally even drinkable, are still slogging it out in the pitiless commercial battlefield of a supermarket near you: Mateus Ros\u00e9, Black Tower, Blue Nun.</p> <p>More interesting are the regional appellations that after years of neglect, critical disdain and flatlining sales, have returned as something else entirely. Regions that have gone from cult to own-label mainstream favourite to beyond the pale and back again. The paradigm of the retro-vintage comeback king is beaujolais. The vignerons of the gamay-producing area north of Lyon once sold millions of bottles of nouveau, that bubblegum-and-banana-scented young red bottled within a couple of months of vintage. But after the 1990s, sales collapsed, their reputation for quality in tatters.

      "bodyText": "Whatever happened to the bestselling wines of the 1970s and 80s? Some, happily, are no longer with us or have been banished to the dustiest reaches of the corner shop, brands such as Hirondelle, Lutomer Laski Riesling, or Le Piat d\u2019Or, that neither we nor the French adore any more. Others, remodelled, repackaged, occasionally even drinkable, are still slogging it out in the pitiless commercial battlefield of a supermarket near you: Mateus Ros\u00e9, Black Tower, Blue Nun. More interesting are the regional appellations that after years of neglect, critical disdain and flatlining sales, have returned as something else entirely. Regions that have gone from cult to own-label mainstream favourite to beyond the pale and back again. The paradigm of the retro-vintage comeback king is beaujolais. The vignerons of the gamay-producing area north of Lyon once sold millions of bottles of nouveau, that bubblegum-and-banana-scented young red bottled within a couple of months of vintage. But after the 1990s, sales collapsed, their reputation for quality in tatters. It\u2019s taken plenty of angsty reflection and, in many cases, financial struggle, but thanks to its cluster of adventurous small producers and its ability to provide the sort of light, fresh red wines that work so well by the glass, beaujolais \u2013 even nouveau, from the right producer \u2013 has become a must-list for a certain kind of modern wine bar and small-plate restaurant. Muscadet, typecast as a cheap and cheerful partner for seafood, was washed away by the fruit-rich new wines of the New World, its complacent producers having cashed in with enormous quantities of sub-standard, brand-damaging acid water.

But for the full nostalgia-tinted house, nothing beats lambrusco. Not as the sweetly gassy, \u00a32.99 initiation rite for generations of teenagers and pre-loading clubbers, but in its original, gorgeously gastronomic form from Emilia-Romagna: a vivid, finger-staining, antipasti-partnering sparkling red.

Anselmo Mendes Muros Antigos Loureiro, Vinho Verde, Portugal 2018 (from \u00a38.95, thewinesociety.com; handford.net; bottleapostle.com) If you grew up on the wince-making acid, prickly spritz and lemony sweetness of old-style supermarket own-label vinho verde, you\u2019d scarcely believe this pristine, racy, floral, citrus and exotic-fruit-scented white came from the same region.

Having had cancer twice before, she knew the suffering the disease, treated or untreated, would entail. And as she hesitated over what course to take, she, like much of the world, was looking at the pictures coming out of Abu Ghraib. This had been one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s most notorious prisons, and was now in US hands. The pictures showed soldiers torturing Iraqis: chaining them to walls; forcing them to stand in painful and humiliating positions; piling them, naked, into human pyramids.</p> <p>You could tell the Americans were having fun. The images they created had not been kept secret. They had been sent to friends, posted to Facebook, taken and spread with a new gadget: a mobile telephone that incorporated a camera.

When she was 12, in a bookstore in California, she came across pictures of the Holocaust. The moment, she said, split her life in two. From then on, in book after book, she tried to understand how images, especially images of suffering and war, reflected reality \u2013 and how they falsified or commodified it. Was it appropriate to take pictures of other people\u2019s suffering? And when such images appeared, was it more grotesque to look \u2013or to look away?</p> <p>And so Sontag went to work on what became her final published essay, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/magazine/regarding-the-torture-of-others.html\">Regarding the Torture of Others</a>. Throughout her career, she had shown the dangers of separating things from their proper names. Aristotle wrote that metaphor \u201cconsists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else\u201d. If that sounded abstract, Sontag would show how the abuse of language could break people\u2019s bodies. Among metaphor\u2019s sinister powers was its ability to twist language in the service of evil causes.</p> <p>The Iraq war began with bad metaphors. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,\u201d said Condoleezza Rice, then President George W Bush\u2019s national security adviser. In England, the \u201cdodgy dossier\u201d showing that Iraq was hiding prohibited weapons was, in the words of a British official, \u201csexed up\u201d. The lead-up to the war began in September 2002. Why then? Well, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/07/nyregion/quotation-of-the-day-766518.html\">Bush\u2019s chief of staff explained</a>, \u201cfrom a marketing point of view, you don\u2019t introduce new products in August\u201d.</p> <p>When the results of these words became evident \u2013 estimates suggest between 465,000 and 1.2 million Iraqis died \u2013 those responsible tried to separate the reality from its representation. The president claimed to be shocked and disgusted by the photographs, Sontag wrote, \u201cas if the fault or horror lay in the images, not in what they depict\u201d. Legalese replaced clear words: \u201cThere was also the avoidance of the word \u2018torture,\u2019\u201d she noted.</p> <p>Those held in the extra-legal US penal empire had become \u201cdetainees\u201d; the newly obsolete word \u201cprisoners\u201d might suggest that they had the rights accorded by international law and the laws of all civilised countries. This endless \u201cglobal war on terrorism\u201d \u2013 into which both the quite justified invasion of Afghanistan and the unwinnable folly in Iraq have been folded by Pentagon decree \u2013 inevitably leads to the demonising and dehumanising of anyone declared by the Bush administration to be a terrorist: a definition that is not up for debate and is, in fact, usually made in secret.</p> <p>Into these fraught meanings entered the camera. Years before, in her great collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/jul/05/photography.artsfeatures\">On Photography</a>, Sontag had called it a \u201cpredatory weapon\u201d and said that \u201cthere is aggression implicit in every use of the camera\u201d.

And so the image had to be made a positive weapon. Pictures had to be wielded against other pictures, as artists since Goya had endeavoured to do.</p> <p>\u201cThe pictures will not go away,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is the nature of the digital world in which we live \u2026 Up to then, there had been only words, which are easier to cover up in our age of infinite digital self-reproduction and self-dissemination, and so much easier to forget.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after the essay was published, Sontag elected to have a bone marrow transplant. \u201cTorture is not too strong a word,\u201d a friend of hers said. But her own bouts with the camera were not over. As she underwent the terrible treatment, her partner, Annie Leibovitz, was taking pictures of her: bloated, writhing, and then, finally, dead. When these pictures were published, after Sontag\u2019s death, they ignited a fierce debate. The questions \u2013 about the ethics of photography, about how to regard the pain of others \u2013 were a homage to Sontag\u2019s final thoughts.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/253/253432/sontag/9780241003480.html\">Sontag: Her Life and Work by Benjamin Moser</a> is published by Allen Lane on 17 September.

Pictures had to be wielded against other pictures, as artists since Goya had endeavoured to do. \u201cThe pictures will not go away,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is the nature of the digital world in which we live \u2026 Up to then, there had been only words, which are easier to cover up in our age of infinite digital self-reproduction and self-dissemination, and so much easier to forget.\u201d Soon after the essay was published, Sontag elected to have a bone marrow transplant. \u201cTorture is not too strong a word,\u201d a friend of hers said. But her own bouts with the camera were not over. As she underwent the terrible treatment, her partner, Annie Leibovitz, was taking pictures of her: bloated, writhing, and then, finally, dead. When these pictures were published, after Sontag\u2019s death, they ignited a fierce debate. The questions \u2013 about the ethics of photography, about how to regard the pain of others \u2013 were a homage to Sontag\u2019s final thoughts. \u2022 Sontag: Her Life and Work by Benjamin Moser is published by Allen Lane on 17 September.

      "bodyText": "NBN Co has shot down an idea for a \u201cNetflix tax\u201d for high-volume users of video streaming services, as the company also looks to target people holding out from moving on to the NBN because it is too expensive. In a proposal put to internet service providers earlier this year, NBN suggested breaking out how streaming video traffic was treated in NBN\u2019s wholesale pricing, with media reports at the time labelling the suggestion as a \u201cNetflix tax\u201d aimed to address the growing demand for streaming video on the NBN. NBN Co announced on Tuesday the Netflix tax idea had been canned after 12 weeks of consultation. The company\u2019s general manager for consumer, Ken Wallace, told Guardian Australia the feedback on the idea was clear. \u201cWe never proposed as such segments pricing; what we did was identify video streaming as a significant driver of traffic. We needed to make sure we were getting feedback from industry on how they were supporting supplying video services,\u201d he said. \u201cWe flagged some possible ways it could be done to get feedback \u2026 and we got a very clear message from industry that it wasn\u2019t something they felt we should be looking at at this time.\u201d Instead the company proposed plans geared more towards high -volume streaming consumers by introducing a new wholesale 100Mbps packages with a lower upload speed of 20Mbps rather than 40Mbps.

NBN\u2019s focus on driving uptake of the mid-tier 50Mbps plan has been wildly successful, with 64% of users on the NBN now on that level, but there has been concern it has been too focused on driving customers to products they might not need and be paying more for in order to recoup the government\u2019s $51bn investment in the project.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson was left humiliated and his claims of progress in the Brexit negotiations in tatters after a chaotic visit to Luxembourg ended in the prime minister being mocked by a fellow European leader for cancelling a press appearance to avoid protesters. Johnson was booed and jeered as he left a working lunch with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, before opting out of plans to speak alongside Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, after being targeted by a larger crowd. The cancellation left Johnson scuttling past the waiting lecterns in a courtyard outside the prime minister\u2019s office to chants of \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d and \u201cbog off Boris\u201d by protesters a few metres away. As the chaotic scenes were played out, the European commission issued a statement disclosing that Juncker had told the prime minister that it was his responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions and that \u201csuch proposals have not yet been made\u201d, in contradiction of the government\u2019s recent claims. The prime minister\u2019s dash to Luxembourg was supposed to have been a key moment for him to illustrate that Brexit talks were moving towards a deal, with Downing Street briefing after the meeting with Juncker that negotiations in Brussels would move from being bi-weekly to daily. But the anger from Britons living in Luxembourg, and the exasperation of the EU leaders spilled over as Johnson moved between meetings. Bettel, who gave a wave to the crowds and offered a defence of their right to demonstrate after Johnson\u2019s decision to leave, did not mince his words as he took the lectern next to the one left empty by the British prime minister\u2019s no-show, with the union flag still in position. He mocked the varying suggestions in recent weeks from Johnson that there had been good progress in the Brexit talks and that it would take the strength of the comic hero, the Incredible Hulk, to leave the EU with a deal. Bettel said: \u201cI asked also Mr Johnson: I read in the papers a few days ago that it goes from \u2018big progress\u2019, to Hulk, to David Cameron proposing a second Brexit [referendum]. And Mr Johnson said there won\u2019t be a second referendum, because I asked him: wouldn\u2019t that be a solution to get out of the situation?\u201d Guy Verhofstadt, the chief Brexit representative for the European parliament, also used the opportunity to ridicule Johnson, tweeting a picture of Bettel next to the empty chair beneath the text: From Incredible Hulk to Incredible Sulk. Bettel said the UK government needed to lay out on paper an alternative to the Irish backstop, and appeared to suggest that party political considerations might be standing in the way. EU officials have long believed that Johnson is unlikely to table any ideas until after the Conservative party conference in two weeks but they fear that this will not allow enough time for a deal to be agreed given the gap between the two sides. A government source confirmed that the UK would not be putting forward any formal text for at least another week. No 10 maintains that progress is being made and that a deal is still possible in the time remaining. Johnson told the BBC he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d because EU leaders had had \u201ca bellyful of all this stuff\u201d. But Bettel said: \u201cPeople need to know what is going to happen to them in six weeks time. They need certainty and they need stability. You cannot hold their future hostage for party political gain.\u201d Gesticulating to the empty lectern, he added: \u201cSo now it is on Mr Johnson.\u201d Bettel raised his voice in frustration when asked by reporters whether Downing Street may be pursuing a sham negotiation in order to pin the blame on the EU for a no-deal Brexit: \u201cI told him, \u2018I hear a lot but I don\u2019t read a lot\u2019.

From the safety of the British embassy, Johnson later told broadcasters the Brexit talks were in a \u201cdifficult moment\u201d and that the press conference had to be cancelled as \u201cthere was clearly going to be a lot of noise and our points would have been drowned out\u201d. Johnson insisted that there was movement in the talks in which the UK is trying to find an alternative plan to the Irish backstop for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. He said: \u201cOver the last couple of weeks, there\u2019s been a lot of work \u2026 papers have been shared. But we are now at the stage where we need to start accelerating the work and that was the agreement today with Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier. \u201cWe need to manage this carefully. Yes there is a good chance of a deal, yes I can see the shape of it.

Confronted with the commission\u2019s statement on a lack of progress, Johnson said: \u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly the case that the commission is still officially sticking on their position that the backstop has got to be there.\u201d The protests outside the Bettel\u2019s offices were organised by David Pike, a classical baritone singer with joint Canadian, British and Luxemburger nationality. He led the noisy singing and chanting to the EU\u2019s anthem. \u201cWe are British and quite often dual nationals. I\u2019m not a protester.

The vote to remain, combined with reassurance from Nicola Sturgeon in a letter directly addressed to EU nationals were considered major factors between the experience of EU citizens in Scotland and England. One Danish man in Glasgow said: \u201cI was feeling really depressed [after the referendum] but then I remember how Nicola Sturgeon went on telly the next morning and spoke directly to EU citizens in Scotland and it\u2019s your home and so on, and that was really reassuring.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember what the letter said but I remember that we got that, me and Fernando and it was so nice to receive this,\u201d said a Portuguese-Brazilian woman. The report, EU families and Eurochildren in Brexiting Britain, found there was still unease over future life. One UK national married to an EU national who have five UK-born children said they feel Brexit is \u201csaying to me the way I live my life is no longer acceptable because I married a foreigner\u201d. Another interviewee spoke of fears they could not bring their elderly parents to the country to look after them even though they had lived here more than 20 years. Others said their self confidence in their identity had been undermined and they had been forced into taking British citizenship. One interviewee from Romania said: \u201cFrankly before Brexit I don\u2019t think I would have gone for something like this. I would have been just happy as a I am.

The trust is worried that there is no clarity about what the government intends to do on immigration. \u201cIt\u2019s not reassuring for researchers right now,\u201d he says. \u201cFor people thinking about moving their lives to another country it is an enormous decision. \u201cThe current immigration system is so bad for science that unless we get some real clarity and improvement, talented people will drift away.\u201d A spokesperson for the Home Office says: \u201cWe welcome international academics and recognise their contribution to the UK\u2019s world-leading education sector. All immigration applications are considered on their individual merits and on the basis of the evidence available.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "I am a lady in my 80s and have been without my BT landline for four weeks because of a fault. It was reported in early August, and an engineer came out promptly to say the fault was by a road and would need traffic lights to assess and repair. There was no communication for a week, so I complained again and another engineer came and told me the same thing. On 23 August, with no progress, I demanded to speak to a manager. When I told him I had received a bill for my line rental, he said it would be waived, but it has been taken out of my account by direct debit. He transferred calls to my mobile, but it is pay-as-you-go, so is very expensive, and it has variable reception. I received an email to say the fault would be repaired by 29 August. But on the evening of 28 August BT apologised, saying it would take another five working days. It said it was doing all it could, but it was all up to Openreach (part of BT). This has caused me much distress. SS, Maidstone, Kent The way you were treated was clearly unacceptable. As soon as we reported your case to BT, all the delays seemed to stop.

Seriously, if you haven\u2019t seen one, have a look. The Ostrichpillow website features some profoundly odd promo shots: a woman curled into the foetal position under a table; someone sleeping standing up like a horse, head resting on a wall; another encased in an outsized fist of grey fabric. The plump, segmented gourd totally envelops the head, with openings at the side into which hands can disappear. It looks so odd, and from the first second I saw it I thought: \u201cI want that.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t buy one, though. As inviting as it looks, you would need courage to use it. An Ostrichpillow in the wild is a bleak snapshot of corporate burnout. The wearer appears to have given up on life, let alone their job. If your boss saw you cosplaying as Toad from Super Mario Bros and sleeping in a corridor, they would assume you were near mental collapse.

The microbeads take the contours of my features as I slip it on, which feels cosy rather than oppressive. It is so comfortable.

Well, the thing is, I don\u2019t know. I am the only one who can\u2019t see me. Maybe I look fine?

Unthinkably, given the proximity of farting strangers, I start to nod off.</p> <p>The effect is heightened by the covering of the ears, which sleep masks cannot replicate. Cocoon-like. It is not so much about eliminating sound as muffling its vibration and removing contact with the air. I couldn\u2019t wear my bulky noise-cancelling headphones, but found to my surprise I was happy to do without. Earphones were accommodated just fine, and you can push the fabric above your eyes without losing neck support. I was able to watch Aquaman in peace; or I would have done, were it not the worst thing that has ever happened. And not just in the history of film.</p> <p>The pillow isn\u2019t perfect. It is meant to be reversible, but I found one side more comfortable than the other. It runs warm, too. The full-sized version must be like a kiln with a porthole. But these are easy things to forgive. Nothing can redeem the plastic cauldron of suffering that is long-haul budget flying, but the pillow does a lot.</p> <p>I was able to use it as a neck warmer when I\u2019d had enough refrigerated air blown directly into my face, and stuff it down the back of the seat just before my vertebrae had permanently relocated. This travel cushion has range. I wish I was brave enough for the otherworldly, uncompromising oddness of the Ostrichpillow Original. But its presentable cousin is far more my speed. In adverse conditions, it gets you dozy and cosy, and quickly.</p> <h2><strong>What</strong><strong> is the literary term for the opposite of Kafkaesque?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThe cocoon effect is so pronounced, Rhik Samadder was disturbed to find he had not awoken as a red admiral.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wellness or </strong><strong>hellness?</strong></h2> <p>Let sleeping divas lie. <strong>5/5</strong></p>",

The effect is heightened by the covering of the ears, which sleep masks cannot replicate. Cocoon-like. It is not so much about eliminating sound as muffling its vibration and removing contact with the air. I couldn\u2019t wear my bulky noise-cancelling headphones, but found to my surprise I was happy to do without. Earphones were accommodated just fine, and you can push the fabric above your eyes without losing neck support. I was able to watch Aquaman in peace; or I would have done, were it not the worst thing that has ever happened. And not just in the history of film. The pillow isn\u2019t perfect. It is meant to be reversible, but I found one side more comfortable than the other. It runs warm, too. The full-sized version must be like a kiln with a porthole. But these are easy things to forgive. Nothing can redeem the plastic cauldron of suffering that is long-haul budget flying, but the pillow does a lot. I was able to use it as a neck warmer when I\u2019d had enough refrigerated air blown directly into my face, and stuff it down the back of the seat just before my vertebrae had permanently relocated. This travel cushion has range. I wish I was brave enough for the otherworldly, uncompromising oddness of the Ostrichpillow Original. But its presentable cousin is far more my speed. In adverse conditions, it gets you dozy and cosy, and quickly. What is the literary term for the opposite of Kafkaesque? \u201cThe cocoon effect is so pronounced, Rhik Samadder was disturbed to find he had not awoken as a red admiral.\u201d Wellness or hellness? Let sleeping divas lie. 5/5",

      "bodyText": "Uncertainty, apprehension and stress were the words people picketing General Motors workers at the car company\u2019s sprawling Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant used to describe day one of their strike. If the strike by United Auto Workers (UAW) members drags on, they could soon end up earning just $250 per week, and there\u2019s fear about what that could mean for their families. But picketers who spoke with the Guardian said they were also certain about their mission, and accept the need to \u201csacrifice\u201d while standing up to what line worker James Cotton called \u201cflat-out greed\u201d on management\u2019s part. The UAW called a strike on Sunday for the first time in over a decade as negotiations reached an impasse. Talks began again on Monday. Cotton and other workers insist they are not just there for the 49,000 union employees at GM\u2019s US plants and distribution centers, but for workers across America who aren\u2019t sharing in high corporate profits, as well as their families and their communities. \u201cWe got families to feed, bills to pay just like anyone else, and that\u2019s tough on us, but we have to do what we have to do to make us stronger in the long run,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about our kids and families and the people who are coming after us, and our fathers and grandfathers who fought for us before.

      "body": "<p>In the second episode of the Netflix drama series Unbelievable, detective Karen Duvall, played by Merritt Wever, conducts what I imagine could be a high-budget training video for sexual assault investigators. Duvall finds the victim, a college student named Amber, processing in the stairwell of her apartment building in Golden, Colorado, one morning in 2011. Duvall already knows the outline of the crime \u2013 breaking and entering, a rape that lasted for hours \u2013 but she starts at the beginning, smoothly guiding Amber through an interview step by step, checking her comfort level with each question. Her voice is disarming and pillowy, couching sentences with \u201cif it\u2019s all right with you\u201d, \u201cif you\u2019re comfortable\u201d and \u201ctake your time\u201d. Yet she builds a case, detail by detail. When she visits Amber at the hospital after her physical exam, she requests the nurse on duty to \u201cask her if she wants me to come in, but make it clear that if she doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s absolutely fine.\u201d Then she immediately calls the station to block off conference room three for her investigation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/13/unbelievable-review-toni-collete-netflix\">Unbelievable review \u2013 grimly credible story of trauma, power and injustice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In other words: she does good work. The whole episode is a portrait in how things should be \u2013 how serious sexual assault cases should be taken, how crucial it is to listen to victims, how memory lapses and scattered details should be considered part and parcel of trauma memory, not a strike against it. It just so happens in this case, what should be is also what was \u2013 the episode, written by Susannah Grant, the series co-creator with Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, is based on the true story outlined in <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/false-rape-accusations-an-unbelievable-story\">An Unbelievable Story of Rape,</a> a 2015 article by T Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong co-published by ProPublica and the Marshall Project. Karen Duvall is inspired by the real detective Stacy Galbraith, also of Golden, who said in the article that her one rule of investigations is to \u201clisten and verify\u201d.</p> <p>In the show, as in real life, Duvall/Galbraith and the detective Grace Rasmussen (based on the real Edna Hendershot) of neighboring Westminster, Colorado, partner up to pursue what they soon realize is a serial rapist evading justice, in part, by exploiting the police\u2019s lack of communication between departments, especially on cold rape cases. Their process is diligent \u2013 late nights, meticulous lists of all cars captured in one recovered security video, data sets on data sets \u2013 and crackling, in the way watching two people consistently level each other up can be; inspiring, in their empathy and doggedness; refreshing, in a way more visceral than intellectual \u2013 it holds my frustratingly short attention span, without draining it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTIkUzkbzQk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QTIkUzkbzQk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This part of the show transcends so-called <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetencePorn\">\u201ccompetence porn\u201d</a> (as in, the thrill of watching talented, smart people work together to solve problems) in part because it acts as the corrective to its other, far more brutal half. Duvall and Rasmussen aren\u2019t even introduced until the second episode; the first belongs to Marie Adler (Kaitlyn Dever), an 18-year-old on the brink of self-sufficiency after a string of foster homes when she calls 911 in Lynwood, Washington, in August 2008. She reports an hours-long rape by a masked stranger, but the police take the opposite tack than Duvall. They elevate minor inconsistencies in Marie\u2019s story into major discrepancies, play her precarious housing situation as leverage, corner her \u2013 both in practice and Lisa Cholodenko\u2019s camera \u2013 into vertiginous doubt. She fearfully recants, and is charged with false reporting.</p> <p>Marie\u2019s report and its aftermath splices Duvall and Rasmussen\u2019s investigation of eerily similar rapes three years later, though neither know it. The stories are two sides of the same coin \u2013 on one, the system failing; on the other, the system working \u2013 and listening \u2013 as it should. It illustrates two truths at the same time: law enforcement fails victims routinely, banally, devastatingly; there are also good actors who do the work. Unbelievable balances the two without veering into the salacious or exploitative \u2013 the assaults cast in brief memory flashes rather than scenes \u2013 or outrage-inducing. There\u2019s certainly a place for outrage \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/09/roll-red-roll-behind-the-chilling-documentary-on-high-school\">Roll Red Roll</a>, a documentary about the Steubenville, Ohio, high school gang rape from a year after the events in Unbelievable, and Chanel Miller\u2019s upcoming book <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/us/brock-turner-rape-victim-chanel-miller-book-emily-doe/index.html\">Know My Name</a>, on the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/heres-the-powerful-letter-the-stanford-victim-read-to-her-ra\">Brock Turner case</a>, remind us that there are shockingly few consequences for assailants deemed \u201cpromising\u201d or when a shard of doubt on the victim\u2019s credibility can paint an assault as \u201cgrey area\u201d.</p> <p>But Unbelievable doesn\u2019t focus on opposition, on uncovering incompetence or bad attitudes in law enforcement or the community. It takes as a given what most of its likely audience already knows: that these obstacles exist, that they must be known and considered, that the conversation moving forward starts from here. Instead, the focus is on getting the job done \u2013 in this case, finding and locking up the serial rapist, giving the victims space and recognition to heal, unwittingly correcting the devastating mistake on Marie\u2019s record three years before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ba92755ba2e0915d93ffdde975a668d132b1ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ba92755ba2e0915d93ffdde975a668d132b1ecc/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kaitlyn Dever in Unbelievable.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kaitlyn Dever in Unbelievable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beth Dubber/NETFLIX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps Unbelievable works, too, as a corrective on old detective story tropes. I\u2019m usually drawn to the self-sabotaging or self-negating \u2013 Amy Adams careening through a vodka-soaked and glaringly <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/sharp-objects-amy-adams-worst-reporter.html\">unethical journalism venture</a> in Sharp Objects, or the melancholic True Detectives. I enjoy the quick hits of resolution in episodic procedurals such as Law &amp; Order SVU, in which the victims usually have crazy backstories and, at most, a few scenes in an episode or two. But there\u2019s something refreshing about seeing two women do their job free of dramatic embellishment \u2013 tackle their case and then go home to their families, to complicated yet stable marriages.</p> <p>It helps that Unbelievable boasts a next-level cast given several episodes to grow. If Dever didn\u2019t already arrive with her scene-stealing turn in Booksmart, then she\u2019s here now as Marie. Wever can convey more feeling with a head-tilt and a \u201chmm\u201d than many could do with a whole monologue. And Collette fills Rasmussen\u2019s steely, guy\u2019s gal shell with a visceral sense of responsibility and faith in her work.</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s that disciplined responsibility that floored me, that made Unbelievable so watchable, despite its grim subject. The unveiling of #MeToo stories the past few years have pummeled me, taught me to mostly doubt justice, to sometimes value trauma as the most publicly interesting and formative thing about women; given this, to see two female detectives do their work well, grind on the job and struggle with the usual work/life balance confounds expectations. Listen. Verify.</p> <p>Back at the hospital in Colorado, Duvall reassures: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to explain any of your decisions to me,\u201d she says when Amber tries to justify why she hasn\u2019t called anyone \u2013 a concern clearly rooted in the knowledge that reporting sexual assault and harassment almost always means reporting on your credibility, too.</p> <p>Later, Duvall walks Amber to a friend\u2019s apartment, gives her number, says she\u2019ll be in touch. She lingers a moment at the closed door, pondering, soaking it in. Then she gets back to work.</p> <ul> <li><p>Unbelievable is streaming now on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

Duvall finds the victim, a college student named Amber, processing in the stairwell of her apartment building in Golden, Colorado, one morning in 2011. Duvall already knows the outline of the crime \u2013 breaking and entering, a rape that lasted for hours \u2013 but she starts at the beginning, smoothly guiding Amber through an interview step by step, checking her comfort level with each question. Her voice is disarming and pillowy, couching sentences with \u201cif it\u2019s all right with you\u201d, \u201cif you\u2019re comfortable\u201d and \u201ctake your time\u201d. Yet she builds a case, detail by detail. When she visits Amber at the hospital after her physical exam, she requests the nurse on duty to \u201cask her if she wants me to come in, but make it clear that if she doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s absolutely fine.\u201d Then she immediately calls the station to block off conference room three for her investigation. In other words: she does good work. The whole episode is a portrait in how things should be \u2013 how serious sexual assault cases should be taken, how crucial it is to listen to victims, how memory lapses and scattered details should be considered part and parcel of trauma memory, not a strike against it. It just so happens in this case, what should be is also what was \u2013 the episode, written by Susannah Grant, the series co-creator with Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, is based on the true story outlined in An Unbelievable Story of Rape, a 2015 article by T Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong co-published by ProPublica and the Marshall Project. Karen Duvall is inspired by the real detective Stacy Galbraith, also of Golden, who said in the article that her one rule of investigations is to \u201clisten and verify\u201d. In the show, as in real life, Duvall/Galbraith and the detective Grace Rasmussen (based on the real Edna Hendershot) of neighboring Westminster, Colorado, partner up to pursue what they soon realize is a serial rapist evading justice, in part, by exploiting the police\u2019s lack of communication between departments, especially on cold rape cases. Their process is diligent \u2013 late nights, meticulous lists of all cars captured in one recovered security video, data sets on data sets \u2013 and crackling, in the way watching two people consistently level each other up can be; inspiring, in their empathy and doggedness; refreshing, in a way more visceral than intellectual \u2013 it holds my frustratingly short attention span, without draining it. This part of the show transcends so-called \u201ccompetence porn\u201d (as in, the thrill of watching talented, smart people work together to solve problems) in part because it acts as the corrective to its other, far more brutal half. Duvall and Rasmussen aren\u2019t even introduced until the second episode; the first belongs to Marie Adler (Kaitlyn Dever), an 18-year-old on the brink of self-sufficiency after a string of foster homes when she calls 911 in Lynwood, Washington, in August 2008. She reports an hours-long rape by a masked stranger, but the police take the opposite tack than Duvall. They elevate minor inconsistencies in Marie\u2019s story into major discrepancies, play her precarious housing situation as leverage, corner her \u2013 both in practice and Lisa Cholodenko\u2019s camera \u2013 into vertiginous doubt. She fearfully recants, and is charged with false reporting. Marie\u2019s report and its aftermath splices Duvall and Rasmussen\u2019s investigation of eerily similar rapes three years later, though neither know it. The stories are two sides of the same coin \u2013 on one, the system failing; on the other, the system working \u2013 and listening \u2013 as it should. It illustrates two truths at the same time: law enforcement fails victims routinely, banally, devastatingly; there are also good actors who do the work. Unbelievable balances the two without veering into the salacious or exploitative \u2013 the assaults cast in brief memory flashes rather than scenes \u2013 or outrage-inducing. There\u2019s certainly a place for outrage \u2013 Roll Red Roll, a documentary about the Steubenville, Ohio, high school gang rape from a year after the events in Unbelievable, and Chanel Miller\u2019s upcoming book Know My Name, on the Brock Turner case, remind us that there are shockingly few consequences for assailants deemed \u201cpromising\u201d or when a shard of doubt on the victim\u2019s credibility can paint an assault as \u201cgrey area\u201d. But Unbelievable doesn\u2019t focus on opposition, on uncovering incompetence or bad attitudes in law enforcement or the community. It takes as a given what most of its likely audience already knows: that these obstacles exist, that they must be known and considered, that the conversation moving forward starts from here. Instead, the focus is on getting the job done \u2013 in this case, finding and locking up the serial rapist, giving the victims space and recognition to heal, unwittingly correcting the devastating mistake on Marie\u2019s record three years before. Perhaps Unbelievable works, too, as a corrective on old detective story tropes. I\u2019m usually drawn to the self-sabotaging or self-negating \u2013 Amy Adams careening through a vodka-soaked and glaringly unethical journalism venture in Sharp Objects, or the melancholic True Detectives. I enjoy the quick hits of resolution in episodic procedurals such as Law &amp; Order SVU, in which the victims usually have crazy backstories and, at most, a few scenes in an episode or two. But there\u2019s something refreshing about seeing two women do their job free of dramatic embellishment \u2013 tackle their case and then go home to their families, to complicated yet stable marriages. It helps that Unbelievable boasts a next-level cast given several episodes to grow. If Dever didn\u2019t already arrive with her scene-stealing turn in Booksmart, then she\u2019s here now as Marie. Wever can convey more feeling with a head-tilt and a \u201chmm\u201d than many could do with a whole monologue. And Collette fills Rasmussen\u2019s steely, guy\u2019s gal shell with a visceral sense of responsibility and faith in her work. Maybe it\u2019s that disciplined responsibility that floored me, that made Unbelievable so watchable, despite its grim subject. The unveiling of #MeToo stories the past few years have pummeled me, taught me to mostly doubt justice, to sometimes value trauma as the most publicly interesting and formative thing about women; given this, to see two female detectives do their work well, grind on the job and struggle with the usual work/life balance confounds expectations. Listen. Verify. Back at the hospital in Colorado, Duvall reassures: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to explain any of your decisions to me,\u201d she says when Amber tries to justify why she hasn\u2019t called anyone \u2013 a concern clearly rooted in the knowledge that reporting sexual assault and harassment almost always means reporting on your credibility, too. Later, Duvall walks Amber to a friend\u2019s apartment, gives her number, says she\u2019ll be in touch. She lingers a moment at the closed door, pondering, soaking it in. Then she gets back to work.

      "bodyText": "The banners are up, the adverts are in local newspapers. No sooner has the autumn term begun than schools are recruiting the next cohort of students. If it sometimes seems that they all say the same things about their engaging curriculum, personalised pastoral care and professional ethos, how can you tell them apart? For some parents, it\u2019s all about outcomes. Which school tops the league table for results? Which has been judged by Ofsted as outstanding? For others, it\u2019s more about a culture that will suit their child. Is there a mobile phone ban? Does the school have the dreaded isolation booths? But there is also another consideration. In the same way that consumers are becoming more ethically driven when it comes to the working conditions of those making their clothes or harvesting their food, some are now wondering about how their child\u2019s teachers are treated. So how can you tell whether a school is \u201ctoxic\u201d? Just to reassure you, there are not many toxic schools out there. However, it is undeniable that a few have an ethos where staff are worked to the bone, made to complete unnecessary tasks, and are not treated with respect. Miserable and exhausted teachers are unlikely to be as effective as they could be. Teaching is tough but not every school seeks to improve conditions for staff. I wouldn\u2019t want my children taught in such an environment, even if whipping their teachers leads to better GCSEs. I\u2019ve known victims of toxic schools. If I could handpick a teacher for my children it would be my friend Sylvia every time. Sylvia ended up in a toxic school. Meetings were called for 7am as well as 7pm; emails demanding immediate actions arrived at all hours, at weekends and during holidays. Her head of department came into her year 11 lesson and announced to the students that if they failed, it would be Sylvia she blamed. The principal never once spoke to her. When she spent hours putting up a beautiful display of student poetry, she was told she\u2019d used the wrong colours and it had to be taken down immediately. Sylvia ended up having a breakdown and quit. It also happens to headteachers. When Rob\u2019s mum died, within six hours of her death his chair of governors had emailed three times wanting to know when he\u2019d be back and whether he could finish the report he was writing by the next day. By the time of his mum\u2019s funeral a week later, the chair had phoned 17 times and sent 50 emails, not one offering condolences. It was the last straw after years in a toxic academy trust. Rob walked away from a school where he was dearly needed. Does this matter to you? And if it does, what are the signs? Look carefully when you visit. Are the senior leadership team visible? Are they talking to children and parents? Are they talking to teacher colleagues, or keeping to themselves in a huddle? How do the teachers interact with one another around the building \u2013 do they seem respectful, happy and positive? Don\u2019t necessarily dismiss schools where teachers look tired \u2013 teachers are nearly always tired and the back-to-school bugs will have hit. Tips on what to ask I\u2019ve heard that triple marking helps children. Do you do that here?Triple marking \u2013 or excessively remarking work \u2013 does not lead to better outcomes but is an indicator of excessive workload expectations. How often will I see marking in my child\u2019s books? Although we are conditioned into thinking lots of marking will improve outcomes, it is not the case.

But instead our boots crunch down onto a concealed ledge that rapidly leads to a heart-pounding procession of cables, rungs and ladders banged into the sheer sides of the rock, all of which have turned this soaring, rippling cliff into one giant vertical adventure park. The white faces soon turn red and sweaty, the silence gives way to gasps and loud exclamations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1290278194190e64159fa1722941b98a65b92dc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1290278194190e64159fa1722941b98a65b92dc8/0_164_2364_1418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 1km drop on Francesco Berti via ferrata.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1km drop on Francesco Berti via ferrata</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Gilchrist/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This descent, the most exhilarating of my life, was a whole new way of experiencing the Dolomites, that magnificent mountain range in northern Italy. We had walked right through this spellbinding landscape the year before, from north to south. But now, instead of heading for the passes, we were tackling the lofty peaks \u2013 an endeavour only made possible by what may well be Italy\u2019s greatest gift to the planet: its extraordinarily numerous and utterly electrifying via ferrata routes.</p> <p>Via ferrata translates as \u201cthe way of iron\u201d, which is what these climbing aids were made of when they were first fixed to rock faces during the first world war, when Italian and Austrian troops fought ferocious battles on these mountains. Today they\u2019re made of steel \u2013 and superbly maintained. On this spectacular stretch, known as the Francesco Berti, the via ferrata opened up what would otherwise have been a preposterously treacherous descent down, through, under and across smooth slabs, notched ridges, spiky outcrops and tottering ledges that can quickly thin to nothing. The drop was about 1km. The thrill was immeasurable.</p> <p>Via ferrata works like this: you wear a harness with two leashes, each bearing a sturdy quick-release clip at the end. These you attach to the cable, always keeping at least one latched on. There are no ropes to lug around; no nuts, hexes or other fiddly anchors to fasten to the rock; no elaborate knots to master. That is not to say there are no risks and never any accidents. If you have any doubts at all about your ability, it\u2019s wise to book a guide who will assess your competence and fitness. The cable won\u2019t stop you falling but it will stop you from falling too far and it has a shock absorber built in.

Alessio had to rope us together and lead us through the gap behind the torrent, which would have swept away anyone in its path.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d said Ed, eyes popping.

      "bodyText": "I am standing on an enormous limestone plateau almost 3km up, peering over the edge of a cliff that seems to plunge all the way to the centre of the Earth. Behind me in the distance are stratified towers of rock, their tips gleaming through wisps of cloud in the morning sun. And in front of me is this breathtaking drop, the gateway to what our guide Alessio calls \u201cthe danger zone\u201d. Alessio stands on the edge, beckons us nearer, then says: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have fun in here.\u201d And over we go, white-faced and silent, feeling like we\u2019re leaping out of a plane. But instead our boots crunch down onto a concealed ledge that rapidly leads to a heart-pounding procession of cables, rungs and ladders banged into the sheer sides of the rock, all of which have turned this soaring, rippling cliff into one giant vertical adventure park. The white faces soon turn red and sweaty, the silence gives way to gasps and loud exclamations. This descent, the most exhilarating of my life, was a whole new way of experiencing the Dolomites, that magnificent mountain range in northern Italy. We had walked right through this spellbinding landscape the year before, from north to south. But now, instead of heading for the passes, we were tackling the lofty peaks \u2013 an endeavour only made possible by what may well be Italy\u2019s greatest gift to the planet: its extraordinarily numerous and utterly electrifying via ferrata routes. Via ferrata translates as \u201cthe way of iron\u201d, which is what these climbing aids were made of when they were first fixed to rock faces during the first world war, when Italian and Austrian troops fought ferocious battles on these mountains. Today they\u2019re made of steel \u2013 and superbly maintained. On this spectacular stretch, known as the Francesco Berti, the via ferrata opened up what would otherwise have been a preposterously treacherous descent down, through, under and across smooth slabs, notched ridges, spiky outcrops and tottering ledges that can quickly thin to nothing. The drop was about 1km. The thrill was immeasurable. Via ferrata works like this: you wear a harness with two leashes, each bearing a sturdy quick-release clip at the end. These you attach to the cable, always keeping at least one latched on. There are no ropes to lug around; no nuts, hexes or other fiddly anchors to fasten to the rock; no elaborate knots to master. That is not to say there are no risks and never any accidents. If you have any doubts at all about your ability, it\u2019s wise to book a guide who will assess your competence and fitness. The cable won\u2019t stop you falling but it will stop you from falling too far and it has a shock absorber built in. Climbers should be fully aware of the risks in advance, as well as the weather forecast, and have proper kit. At the start, I was seeking out holds, thinking this would provide a more authentic experience, letting me feel at one with the mountain. But after about 10 minutes, I was completely at one with the cable, gripping it with both fists and even my knees \u2013 particularly when, after one ill-judged stretch, I slowly spun through 180 degrees and found myself facing outwards, feet dangling in thin air, gazing at nothing but blue skies and distant summits. The cable, I realised, is there to be grabbed. When people gasp at your photographs, at those giddying images of you nonchalantly hanging off a pinnacle nosing up into the stratosphere, you have to fight the urge to blurt out: \u201cIt\u2019s actually not that hard!\u201d We\u2019re not even climbers. We\u2019re hillwalkers. And we\u2019re pretty rubbish. The four of us have got lost on every big peak in the Scottish Highlands, and plenty of small ones too.

Corbusier called the Dolomites the greatest architecture on Earth and we were right in the heart of it.

There is something that occurs that is \u2026 unexpected. But that is very nice.\u201d</p> <p>The choreography of his dancers\u2019 glossy locks, as well as their limbs, is essential to Preljocaj\u2019s 2016 piece La Fresque, which has its UK premiere at Sadler\u2019s Wells in London this month. It is based on a traditional Chinese tale about a traveller who discovers a painting on the wall of a temple, enters the world of the picture and weds one of the five women it depicts before crashing back to reality. When he looks back at the image on the wall, he discovers that the woman\u2019s hair, which once flowed freely, is now fixed in a chignon symbolising that she is indeed married.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1da22e8647a25649c1f36d262e7c7238f7504de3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1da22e8647a25649c1f36d262e7c7238f7504de3/0_1096_6016_2588/1000.jpg\" alt=\"La Fresque.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"430\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creating a house for dancers \u2026 La Fresque.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Claude Carbonne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>La Fresque opens with a stunning lighting configuration by designer Eric Soyer, which suggests a storm encountered by the traveller. In fact, says Preljocaj, \u201cwhat you see at the very beginning is a lock of hair floating\u201d. These long, ghostly strands twist into a pulsing, knotty mass that the travellers pass through. When the women in the painting first appear their bodies are intertwined \u2013 almost plaited together \u2013 but in a sequence that thrums to the electro score of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/31/how-we-made-moon-safari-air-jean-benoit-dunckel-nicolas-godin-interview\">Air</a>\u2019s Nicolas Godin, they shake themselves free with shockheaded moves that send their tresses flying. It makes the fidgety hair-flickers of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQCTbCcSxis\">Rosas Danst Rosas</a> look positively languid.</p> <p>In a later scene, Preljocaj\u2019s dancers are suspended midair, wrapped around circus ropes that resemble braids. And in one sequence, with a seductive mystery characteristic of his creations, four women revolve around the betrothed, twisting her hair as if holding maypole ribbons, before pinning it into a bun.</p> <p>Aside from works such as his Orwellian Romeo and Juliet and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/may/11/ballet-preljocaj-snow-white-review\">Snow White</a> that paired Mahler\u2019s music with outre Gaultier outfits, Prelojcaj usually favours the abstract over a narrative. But one constant is his preoccupation with the sort of nuanced rituals seen in La Fresque. \u201cDance itself is a ritual in essence,\u201d he says. \u201cEach time you have people dancing, whatever the performance, it is a kind of ritual. There is something sacred about it. Dance is showing the soul with your body.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7bca8cf73642fc32db0d55734359175b8ce657c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7bca8cf73642fc32db0d55734359175b8ce657c/503_0_4274_2566/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MC 14/22 (Ceci est mon corps) performed by Scottish Ballet at the Edinburgh festival in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disquieting \u2026 MC 14/22 (Ceci est mon corps) performed by Scottish Ballet at the Edinburgh festival in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The apotheosis of this for Preljocaj, who has made pieces about both the apocalypse and the annunciation, is perhaps his disquieting 2001 creation <a href=\"http://www.preljocaj.org/menu.php?lang=en&amp;m=1&amp;a=4&amp;m2=16\">MC 14/22 (Ceci Est Mon Corps)</a>, its title reflecting the chapter and verse of St Mark\u2019s Gospel relating the Last Supper (\u201cTake it, this is my body\u201d).

Beneath tents and canopies, on block after block, rested every kind of stone imaginable: the opaque, soapy pastels of angeline; dark, mossy-toned epidote; tourmaline streaked with red and green. There were enormous, dining-table-sized pieces selling for tens of thousands of dollars, lumps of rose quartz for $100, crystal eggs for $1.50. Crystals were stacked upon crystals, filling plastic trays, carved into every possible shape: knives, penises, bathtubs, angels, birds of paradise.</p> <p>It was the month of the Tucson gem shows, a series of markets and exhibitions that collectively make up the largest crystal expo in the world. More than 4,000 crystal, mineral and gemstone vendors had come to sell their wares. They were expecting more than 50,000 customers to pass through, from new age enthusiasts with thick dreadlocks and tie-dye T-shirts, to gallery owners, suited businessmen and major wholesalers. Deals done here would determine the fate of tens of thousands of tonnes of crystals, dispatching them across the US and Europe into museums and galleries, crystal healing and yoga centres, wellness retailers and Etsy stores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/oct/04/dark-crystals-the-brutal-reality-behind-a-booming-wellness-craze-podcast\">Dark crystals: the brutal reality behind a booming wellness craze \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Five years ago, crystals were not a big deal. Now, powered by the lucrative combination of social media-friendly aesthetics, cosmic spirituality and the apparently unstoppable wellness juggernaut, they have gone from a niche oddity associated with patchouli and crushed velvet to a global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jun/16/are-crystals-the-new-blood-diamonds-the-truth-about-muky-business-of-healing-stones\">consumer phenomenon</a>. On Instagram, hashtags for #crystals and #healingcrystals tick into the tens of millions. In 2017, the New York Times heralded \u201cthe great crystal boom\u201d and in 2018 Hello! described them as the year\u2019s biggest health and wellness trend. Sold as lamps, sex toys, facial massagers or \u201cvaginal eggs\u201d hawked by Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle empire Goop, there is now a crystal for every possible occasion. As Kim Kardashian was recovering from her robbery at gunpoint in 2016, she embraced healing crystals. The model Miranda Kerr has said that she filters all her skincare products through rose quartz \u201cto give the vibration of self-love\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd623927bbe5efa3c2e6535e89636a7ff68c6849\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd623927bbe5efa3c2e6535e89636a7ff68c6849/0_0_5580_4096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Gem and Mineral Show in Tucson, Arizona in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"734\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gem and Mineral Show in Tucson, Arizona in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BAE Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the US, demand for overseas crystals and gemstones has doubled over the past three years, and quartz imports have doubled since 2014. (Those numbers capture raw stone, but not the crystals imported under many other categories: jewellery, home goods, decorations.) Daniel Trinchillo, owner of Fine Minerals International, a high-end crystal dealership, told me that his business makes between $30m and $40m in sales each year. Trinchillo caters to a growing cohort of celebrities, collectors and investment buyers who want rare and valuable crystals. The most expensive single piece he has sold went for $6m, but he knows of some that have sold for $10m. Trinchillo estimates that high-end dealers now account for about $500m in annual sales. Include the lower end, he said, and you are talking about a highly profitable, multi-billion dollar industry.</p> <p>Believers say crystals conduct ambient energy \u2013 like miniature phone towers picking up signals and channelling them on to the user \u2013 thus rebalancing malign energies, healing the body and mind. First popularised in the west in the 1970s, crystal healing\u2019s recent resurgence has coincided with growing interest in alternative spirituality and healing practices. According to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/\" title=\"\">Pew Research Center</a> data, more than 60% of US adults hold at least one \u201cnew age\u201d belief, such as placing faith in astrology or the power of psychics, and 42% think spiritual energy can be located in physical objects such as crystals. Not surprisingly, then, scientific criticism of crystal healing has done little to dim demand. Last year, Paltrow faced (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/05/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-to-pay-out-over-unproven-health-benefits-of-vaginal-eggs\" title=\"\">and settled</a>) a misleading advertising lawsuit for claiming that Goop\u2019s vaginal egg crystals had the power to balance hormones and regulate menstrual cycles. But still, the rise of crystals continues. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/17/healing-crystals-wellness-mining-madagascar\">Dark crystals: the brutal reality behind a booming wellness craze</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite that explosive growth, the way the crystal industry operates has largely avoided close scrutiny. There is little in the way of fair-trade certification for crystals, and none of the industry-wide transparency schemes developed for commodities such as gold and diamonds. Tracing a crystal from the time it is dragged, dusty and cracked, from the earth, to the polished moment of final sale requires a journey backward down the supply chain: from shop, to exporter, to middleman, to mine, and finally to the men and women who work below the ground, on whose labour a billion-dollar industry has been built.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, but beneath its soil is a well-stocked treasure chest. Rose quartz and amethyst, tourmaline and citrine, labradorite and carnelian: Madagascar has them all. Gems and precious metals were the country\u2019s fastest-growing export in 2017 \u2013 up 170% from 2016, to $109m. This island country of 25 million people now stands alongside far larger nations, such as India, Brazil and China, as a key producer of crystals for the world. And in a country where infrastructure, capital and labour regulation are all in short supply, it is human bodies rather than machinery that pull crystals from the earth. While a few large mining companies operate in Madagascar, more than 80% of crystals are mined \u201cartisanally\u201d \u2013 meaning by small groups and families, without regulation, who are paid rock-bottom prices.</p> <p>If you want to know where the rose quartz on your shelves comes from, Anjoma Ramartina is a good place to begin. A collection of villages that sits atop some of Madagascar\u2019s largest rose quartz deposits, it is a day\u2019s drive from the capital city of Antananarivo. The further you travel from the capital, the greater the security risks. Large swathes of territory are described as \u201cred zones\u201d, considered unpoliceable by state forces. Rural villages often face raids from armed gangs known as <em>dahalo</em>, who steal cattle, sometimes killing, robbing or raping villagers. In January, the week we arrived in Anjoma Ramartina, three men armed with machetes were killed in a clash with village police. Do not travel or go out at night, people warned. Drive in convoy. Stay off the roads after 5pm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/madagascar-zip/giv-3902X81wTk4m7xmu/\" data-alt=\"madagascar map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/madagascar-zip/giv-3902X81wTk4m7xmu/\">madagascar map</a> </figure>  <p>Most homes in Anjoma Ramartina have no electricity, no running water, no phone or network connections. Malnutrition is common. According to the World Bank, around 80% of those outside Madagascar\u2019s cities live below the <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/international-poverty-line-has-just-been-raised-190-day-global-poverty-basically-unchanged-how-even\" title=\"\">$1.90-a-day poverty line</a>. Health researchers found around half of parents in Anjoma Ramartina had lost at least one infant child to illness or hunger. As we made our way there, the driver noted that the road had recently been sealed \u2013 a vast difference from the deeply potholed gravel nearer town. \u201cThis is one of the best roads I have seen here.\u201d He laughed: \u201cHere in Madagascar, the road only gets made when there is something they want to get out.\u201d</p> <p>In a cool, dark room in the town council hall, Many Jean Rahandrinimaro, the deputy mayor of Anjoma Ramartina, sunk into a black vinyl couch. \u201cCrystal, amethyst, rose quartz,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything except sapphires and rubies, we mine here.\u201d He placed a few stones on the wooden table in front of him: polished clear quartz and purple amethyst. He estimated that from a population of about 10,000 people, up to a quarter of locals now depended on the mines for some income. Between two and four men died each year in the crystal pits surrounding this village, he said \u2013 only two last year, but often it was three or four. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s very dangerous but they still mine, because they want money,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s the possibility of landslide, that happens a lot here. The soil falls on them and they die.\u201d</p> <p>Landslides are not the only danger for miners. Smashed rocks create fine dust and quartz particles can penetrate deep into the lungs. There, they fester, inflaming surrounding cells, increasing the risk of lung cancer and silicosis. Child labour is also widespread: the US Department of Labor and the International Labour Organization estimate that about 85,000 children work in Madagascar\u2019s mines.</p> <p>A few days after our first meeting, I returned to the town hall. In a ruled exercise book, Many Jean traced a finger over the town\u2019s registry of deaths, tapping entries on the page: here and here, the two men who died in the mines last year, recorded in neat cursive handwriting. And here, Benoit Razafimahatratra, who had died two years earlier when he was looking for quartz at a quarry to the east. Many Jean knew where Benoit\u2019s family lived, and offered to show the way on his motorbike.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b8482c59d082e0c0b53c6946725b87fb18cede23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8482c59d082e0c0b53c6946725b87fb18cede23/0_0_4608_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose quartz lies in the sun at the edge of a mine near Anjoma Ramartina in Madagascar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose quartz lies in the sun at the edge of a mine near Anjoma Ramartina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tess McClure</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bomber jacket flapping behind him, Many Jean took us to the next village. Sitting in a small shop that sold fritters and dried fish was Jean Gregoire Randrianarisoa. He looked tired. Yes, his older brother had died, he said. \u201cWhat killed him was digging for stones, about 15 metres deep. He went into a tunnel and it collapsed from above and he was buried \u2013 someone called for help: \u2018Help! Zafimahatratra is buried down there!\u2019 That\u2019s when I went with his children to dig him up,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Benoit was about 55 when he died, said his widow, Josephine Rasondrina, a tiny woman, less than 5 feet tall, with hair neatly divided into braids. She brought out a photograph of him. His features had faded. Josephine gestured at her two granddaughters, about six or seven years old, sitting on the steps. \u201cSince my husband died, they stopped going to school. Since my husband died I got really tired.\u201d She raised her fingers to her temple. \u201cI am really tired. Emotionally and physically \u2013 because I have to work the field to feed my children.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Common crystals, such as quartz, can form almost anywhere around the world, when water and steam carry mineral particles into fractures in the earth. Drawn together by the mutual attraction of their electrical charges, their molecules stack in orderly sequences, forming defined planes and repeating facets that can create the pleasing shapes \u2013 geodes, prisms \u2013 that they\u2019re sought for. In the mineral-rich earth of central Madagascar, villagers often find quartz and citrine deposits by chance, when they are revealed by landslide or washed down to nearby riverbeds. The mines dug to meet growing demand are often improvised, operated off the books and without permits.</p> <p>One of these makeshift mines lies about an 18-mile hike from Anjoma Ramartina\u2019s nearest road. Rakotondrasolo, the man who villagers called the mine owner, found the site about 20 years ago, and continues to work there, along with his family, to this day. One morning, he agreed to show me the mine. Rakotondrasolo is tall and very thin. His worn flannel shirt was buttoned over a T-shirt with the face of Andry Rajoelina, Madagascar\u2019s newly elected president. (The T-shirts were everywhere, after being thrown from trucks and doled out at political rallies across the country during the 2018 election campaign.) The red dust of the landscape had worked its way into the weave of his clothing until every garment was infused with terracotta orange.</p> <p>As we made our way along the red dirt track to the mine, the sun was directly above, shimmeringly hot. Here and there was a sparkle among the scrubby grass: hunks of pink crystal, scattered at the path\u2019s edge. Walking behind Rakotondrasolo, his wife pointed: \u201cThe stones are beautiful,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cbut the work is very hard.\u201d Then the grass of the track ended sharply and the deep red cavern of the mine fell away in front of us. \u201cKeep away from the edge,\u201d said Rakotondrasolo, gesturing to where the ground was cracked and unstable. The pit dropped 15 metres deep, narrowing as it deepened. On the sheer face of rock were cross-hatched marks of spades and pickaxes. At the far side of the cavern, a huge pile of rose-coloured stones caught the sunlight. At the bottom, a passage disappeared, curving out of the light.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d95e751fe47cc0a8aba7c14ae1e08c2a85960dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d95e751fe47cc0a8aba7c14ae1e08c2a85960dd/0_0_4608_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rakotondrasolo, a miner from a village near Anjoma Ramartina, at the edge of the rose quartz mine where he and his family work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rakotondrasolo, a miner from a village near Anjoma Ramartina, at the edge of the rose quartz mine where he and his family work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tess McClure</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he said, as we trod over the edge of the crater, \u201cthe rocks are sharp.\u201d Rose quartz cracked underfoot: jagged, gleaming, a little translucent, shining like the flesh of a fresh-filleted tuna. Later, he lifted a worn trouser leg to show the scars he had acquired from a lifetime of mining: on the right leg, where falling stones crushed his shin, and on the left where a sharp edge split the skin, requiring six stitches.</p> <p>At other times, this crater would have been busy with the sound of men at work \u2013 his sons and nephews, who would come to dig and then split the cost of stone they sold \u2013 but today it was silent except for Rakotondrasolo\u2019s careful footsteps. They had stopped work: rains had been heavy, and they worried that the water made the cavern less stable. \u201cI was afraid, and was afraid for my children because of this soil. It can collapse on them. I asked them to stop working here,\u201d Rakotondrasolo said.</p> <p>He threw in a handful of gravel and it tumbled to the bottom. Of his 10 children, seven worked with him in the mine. The boys started at the age of about 14. When they find a thick seam of quartz they smash it out of the rock, then chain the pieces together. Some blocks are small, but others are 100kg or even 200kg. The miners drag the boulders out of the hole, sometimes five people hauling together, up on to the grass embankment and toward the hill where lorries come to load them.</p> <p>I asked where the crystals went from there. \u201cTo the ports,\u201d Rakotondrasolo shrugged. He did not know. Somewhere overseas. A long time ago a client brought him a rose orb, cut and polished into a sphere, to show him what eventually became of some of the stones he had mined. But the buyers mostly say little about what the crystals are used for or where they end up. They pay him and leave \u2013 about 800 ariary, or 23\u00a2 a kilo, he said \u2013 17\u00a2 for lower quality. It is not much when the money is split between the men at work: 800 ariary buys a cup of rice at the village market.</p> <p>As Rakotondrasolo stepped away from the crater, a low hiss sounded behind him. We turned back to see a thin layer of red gravel, loosened from the wall, slide down into the hole.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While some mines are large, open pits, others are claustrophobically small: networks of tunnels piercing the earth. About 120 miles east of Anjoma Ramartina lies Ibity, a small village surrounded by tourmaline mines, where you have to dig deep to find stones.</p> <p>\u201cThe deeper you go, the more difficult it is to breathe,\u201d said Italy Miliama, a shopkeeper at the centre of the village, scooping coffee into enamel cups.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you see a stone, you follow it to find the other stones,\u201d said one of his friends. \u201cWe dig, dig, dig. We call it the stone way, the way of stones.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d5da839b47d2ceeed35f57df6af03076fbb58612\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5da839b47d2ceeed35f57df6af03076fbb58612/0_0_4608_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tavita, 14, working at a mine near Ibity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tavita, 14, working at a mine near Ibity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tess McClure</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mines at Ibity spread out like an ochre moonscape. On the morning I visited, about 20 people were above ground sifting through the soil. Among them, a local miner named Jean Baptiste Rakotondravelo and his son stood barefoot, turning a large, improvised pulley. Their backs strained against the weight. A moment later, up came a large yellow jerrycan, full of red earth from below. Jean Baptiste\u2019s son carried it to his mother and young siblings and dumped it on a pile of dirt that they sifted with their fingers. The day was hot, the sun nearing its peak. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard work,\u201d Jean Baptiste said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be done by a few people. It has to be done by many.\u201d</p> <p>At his feet was a hole about a metre in diameter, with sheer sides like a well. Shining my torch down the hole, I couldn\u2019t see to the bottom. Every so often a faint shout echoed up from the darkness, and Jean Baptiste and his son put their backs again to pulling up the bucket. His other sons were working down there, Jean Baptiste told me, digging for tourmaline. He shrugged: \u201cGo down if you like.\u201d</p> <p>Near the top of the hole, it was possible to make out mosquitoes catching the light. As they turned the pulley and I descended, gripping the rope with both hands, the light retreated. The passage down was tight, the damp earth walls grazing my back, elbows and knees. Reaching the bottom, the air felt thin and it was a little harder to draw a full breath. On one side, there was a small horizontal tunnel with room only to crawl.</p> <p>I crouched and shouted into the darkness. \u201cSalama!\u201d two young voices called back, and deep in the tunnel, pair of dim headlamps turned to face me. Two boys blinked into the torchlight. The smallest wore a yellow cloth baseball cap, and his eyes were wide, mouth slightly open with surprise. Their names were Roland and Tavita: Jean Baptiste\u2019s sons, who he says are about 14 and 17. They started working down here two years ago, spending hours digging underground, crouching in the dark, backs curved, calves aching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0076aab7e8a0825e13f861be430c898b27adb444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0076aab7e8a0825e13f861be430c898b27adb444/0_0_4608_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tavita (left), 14, and Roland, 17, hunting for tourmaline around 15-20 metres below ground.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tavita (left) and Roland, 17, hunting for tourmaline around 15-20 metres below ground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tess McClure</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Deep underground, we looked mutely at each other for a moment. Ducking into the crawl-space, I was conscious of the weight of dirt resting above us: about 19 tonnes of soil and rock, suspended only by its own natural cohesion. Roland and Tavita squatted, jamming a spade or crowbar into the soil to dislodge it and pack it into the jerrycan. When it was full they would crawl back toward the light, shoving the heavy dirt bucket ahead of them, to be dragged up top.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s too long they can have difficulty breathing, so they come out,\u201d Jean Baptiste said, back at the top of the well. Above ground, the boys\u2019 mother, Odette, sat working alongside two generations of children, the youngest a fat-cheeked six-month-old girl. Odette sifted through the dirt, searching for a rock shaped differently from the rest: the small, wine-red and green crystal, tourmaline. \u201cSometimes we go months without finding any,\u201d she said. They had found just one today, about the size of a knuckle.</p> <p>Odette held it out to me, streaked with red dust, in the middle of her palm. At that moment, it was worth just a few cents. But in the months to come, it would slide along the global supply chain, its value multiplying with each stage of the journey.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For the crystals mined in Anjoma Ramartina, the path out of the country is through a company called <a href=\"https://madagascar-specimens.com/\" title=\"\">Madagascar Specimens</a>, which exports about 65 tonnes of carved crystals a year. At its premises, a converted house in the outer suburbs of Antananarivo, boxes of crystals were stacked against the wall. A row of shining SUVs were parked outside the house. Samples stood on the disused fireplace: carved angels, pyramids, geodes, wands. The rose quartz had been trucked in rough from Anjoma Ramartina by a local middleman, the village\u2019s former mayor, who bought large quantities from Rakotondrasolo\u2019s mine.</p> <p>The owner of Madagascar Specimens, Liva Marc Rahdriaharisoa, a tall man in dark jeans, wire-rimmed glasses and a navy T-shirt, gestured to the stack of boxes to his left, packed for shipping. \u201cThis, for example, is going to Canada. This to Netherlands. This to the United States,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He lifted the lid on a box of quartz massage wands. \u201cThese are very popular.\u201d Then another box of rose quartz hearts: \u201cSome of our best sellers,\u201d he said. \u201cCrystals are the most popular stones now \u2013 many customers are looking for it, because \u2013 I\u2019m not sure of the English \u2013 the medicine with crystals is very popular now. Like therapy, the belief crystals have healing power, you know? It\u2019s very \u2013 how do you say? \u2013 trendy.\u201d</p> <p>The gem and mineral expo in Tucson was a key point in Liva Marc\u2019s year. \u201cThat is where you\u2019re looking for customers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see all customers from around the world: Chinese, Japanese, New Zealand, Australian. It is the biggest market in the world. We go there to exhibit, to sell, but most important is to find customers there.\u201d</p> <p>Between the buyers in the US and the mines in Madagascar was a gulf of experience, which, sitting in the courtyard of Liva Marc\u2019s small factory, he found hard to express. \u201cIt\u2019s like two galaxies,\u201d he said, grinning and shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a big difference. If I say to people at the mine what Tuscon is like, they will never understand. And if I say to the Tucson people to come here, they will never understand. It\u2019s very different worlds.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledged the poor conditions at the mines he bought from. \u201cYou were shocked, but I was shocked, too! When you see in the rough, [stones weighing] like 50kg, 60kg, they drag it four, five kilometres, two or three per day, and earning only $1? You know, it\u2019s \u2026 \u201d He paused. \u201cSometimes you can\u2019t imagine how they can do this.\u201d</p> <p>Madagascar Specimens exports some crystals rough, but its workshop in Antananarivo also works the stones, cutting them into shapes, grinding and polishing the faces. From Liva Marc\u2019s perspective, refining the stone in Madagascar means creating steady jobs and keeping more of the value of the crystals in the country. With stone that was exported rough and then carved in China or the US, almost none of the profit stayed in Madagascar.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe they [shops in the US] don\u2019t explain it to their customers. It\u2019s business for them, they want money. They will never say: \u2018I buy this for $1 and I sell to you for $1,000\u2019,\u201d he laughed, \u201cbut that\u2019s the reality.\u201d</p> <p>The plunder of Madagascar\u2019s resources for profit is nothing new. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the country was a source of slaves, bought by Europeans and sent to work in brutal conditions, often on sugar plantations on the islands of Mauritius, R\u00e9union and Rodrigues. When the French colonised Madagascar in 1895, they outlawed slavery, but ushered in a new era of forced labour and extraction, with tens of thousands of tonnes of rosewood and millions of francs\u2019 worth of gold shipped offshore each year. More than a century later, the country\u2019s riches still rarely benefit the Malagasy people, says Zo Andriamaro, a sociologist and human rights analyst. Gold, cobalt, sapphires, crystals: she sees them all as part of the same old story, resources siphoned out of the country for the benefit of foreign companies. \u201cThere has to be some more systematic way of controlling and regulating the market for all types of minerals coming from here,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is totally unjust.\u201d</p> <p>Mining also threatens Madagascar\u2019s rainforest. When new mining sites are discovered, sometimes thousands of men migrate to mine, encroaching on protected environmental areas and threatening the survival of endangered species. Embracing mining on a larger scale is \u201cintrinsically, fundamentally unsustainable and destructive\u201d, Andriamaro says. \u201cYou can never pretend that you will restore the environment to its initial state.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The month after we spoke in Madagascar, Liva Marc and a shipping container full of his stones landed in Arizona, bound for the Tucson shows. I met him in a hotel lobby, one of three retail spots he had in the city. Business was good, he said. Buyers from all over the world had come.</p> <p>The stalls around him showcased towering display pieces: rose quartz boulders, massive amethyst geodes. They had been cleaned, polished and set on display, but he still looked at them and thought of their origins. \u201cAll these big pieces \u2013 imagine how they must dig it. How difficult it must be,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine how it starts.\u201d</p> <p>While the crystal business is booming, and largely among consumers who tend to be concerned with environmental impact, fair trade and good intentions, there is little sign of the kind of regulation that might improve conditions for those who mine them.</p> <p>Julia Schoen, co-founder of the crystal drink bottle company Glacce (tagline \u201cLuxury Spiritual\u201d) told me that ethical sourcing is \u201cthe No 1 priority\u201d for her company. Schoen was speaking on the phone from her office in New Orleans, where she told me she was surrounded by crystals that had been unboxed and laid out, waiting to be blessed by staff, who would burn sage smudge sticks and pray to cleanse them before use.</p> <p>Glacce sells water bottles and metal straws embedded with rose quartz, amethyst and other crystals, which are supposed to transform ordinary water into a \u201ccrystal elixir\u201d, where the water takes on the healing properties of the crystal. The bottles were touted by Vanity Fair as \u201c2018\u2019s Status Symbol\u201d and are sold by bohemian-themed fashion retailer Free People, as well as Goop. Schoen said sales of the bottles, which retail for $60-$100, had increased exponentially since they started the business, and demand often outstripped supply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea804c0c1cf5694dd3968df27977249e12f82ea2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea804c0c1cf5694dd3968df27977249e12f82ea2/0_0_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tucson Gem and Mineral Show in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tucson Gem and Mineral Show in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zuma Press/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But even with a booming market, she said, the company didn\u2019t yet have a budget to track their crystals to their source at the mines. Instead, Glacce depended on Chinese middlemen to select crystals, including those from Madagascar. Schoen told me that Glacce\u2019s suppliers \u201cknow that we do not want to be having our money go towards a mine that\u2019s using child labour. They know all these things.\u201d At present, she said, they considered transparency a high priority and hoped to develop relationships with individual mines by 2020, but could offer no concrete reassurances about the current conditions of their miners.</p> <p>\u201cIn an industry that has not been so regulated and maybe hasn\u2019t had so many eyeballs on it, there are obviously practices that most people who are purchasing crystals would not want to know about,\u201d Schoen acknowledged. \u201cYou know, at the end of the day it\u2019s like, our intentions are \u2013 \u201d she paused. \u201cI think we\u2019re clear what our intentions are.\u201d</p> <p>The challenge of sourcing crystals ethically is one faced by the industry as a whole: Glacce, Goop or any given Etsy vendor are no more culpable than the next crystal dealer. Every retailer I spoke to raised the question of price. Would crystal consumers really be willing to pay more to guarantee safer, child labour-free mines, or a fair wage for miners? Schoen compared it to the organic food movement: if enough people wanted assurance of their products\u2019 provenance, the supply systems would develop.</p> <p>At Tuscon, in the marquee for crystal vendor The Village Silversmith, I asked owner John Bajoras \u2013 tall, tanned and broad-shouldered, with an enormous shark tooth around his neck \u2013 where the responsibility lay if crystals were coming from mines where people, many of them children, were risking their lives for meagre pay. It is all about the customers, Bajoras said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete conundrum. I get somebody with dreadlocks, and a peace-hippie attitude, and you try to sell them a piece of labradorite from Madagascar for $12. And they\u2019re like: \u2018I\u2019ll give you $6, dude.\u2019 That\u2019s where the fucking problem is. If they were like \u2018It\u2019s $12? Well, how about I give you $20?\u2019 [then] you could kick $8 back down the line, sure. That\u2019s the problem. The problem is your end consumer. Not anybody else in the pipeline. The end consumer is the person who sets the price.\u201d</p> <p>Bajoras visited Madagascar often, but rarely made it out to the mines, opting instead to deal with middlemen in the cities. But he knew the villages of Anjoma Ramartina and Ibity: \u201cYeah. All our rose quartz comes from that area. All the tourmaline comes from there,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And if some of the conditions are truly awful? \u201cAwful is relative, remember,\u201d he shot back. The volume of his voice rose slightly, but he was still smiling. \u201cYour job looks horrible to me. I feel for you. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re willing to do it, because we need people like you to do it, but I ain\u2019t fuckin\u2019 doing it, no way. I would rather die in a mine, any day, no doubt. Holy shit. No. Not happening. Spell check? You\u2019re out of your fucking mind.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/industry-research/2018-global-wellness-economy-monitor/\" title=\"\">$4.2tn</a><a href=\"https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/industry-research/2018-global-wellness-economy-monitor/\" title=\"\"> wellness industry</a> rolls on, bolstered by profits from cheap crystals and a generation looking for alternative modes of healing. Bajoras was confident his stones had healing power. After all, he said, if uranium could kill you, why shouldn\u2019t lithium quartz be able to help cure your depression? And when you broke it down to an elemental level, he said, people are mostly minerals and water anyway. \u201cYou\u2019re hydrated mineral powder,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou are! You\u2019re like Kool-Aid.\u201d</p> <p>Beneath a tented canopy beside the Tucson freeway, his colleague Alexa Stamison was selling an array of Madagascan rose quartz, carnelian and amethyst. Stamison had a warm, open manner and an encyclopedic knowledge of their stones.</p> <p>A woman dressed all in white \u2013 crocheted shirt, maxi skirt and headscarf draped over her top-knot \u2013 approached the stall. \u201cHow much is this carnelian?\u201d she asked. The stone was $30. A stone of empowerment, Stamison told me, great for women going out on their own or moving into a new home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/23/fairtrade-ethical-certification-supermarkets-sainsburys\">Is fair trade finished?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think I need it, it was just calling to me and I couldn\u2019t walk away,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI don\u2019t need a bag, I\u2019ll just carry it.\u201d She walked away, cradling the stone.</p> <p>If anything, Stamison wonders if the circumstances of miners in Madagascar, \u201cmakes the pieces a lot more special. Because I know some person in a little baby hut was actually polishing it by hand, and they\u2019re setting their intentions into it, too,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople\u2019s intentions and people\u2019s energy are put into the stones as they\u2019re producing it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo the circumstances they\u2019re mined in, they are embedded into the stone somehow?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cI think so. A little bit, it has to be. It has to be.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional research by Holifeno Hantanrinoro and Teddy Rahenintsoa</em></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In February, crystals colonised Tucson. They spread out over carparks and gravel lots, motel courtyards and freeway footpaths, past strip malls and burger bars. Beneath tents and canopies, on block after block, rested every kind of stone imaginable: the opaque, soapy pastels of angeline; dark, mossy-toned epidote; tourmaline streaked with red and green. There were enormous, dining-table-sized pieces selling for tens of thousands of dollars, lumps of rose quartz for $100, crystal eggs for $1.50. Crystals were stacked upon crystals, filling plastic trays, carved into every possible shape: knives, penises, bathtubs, angels, birds of paradise. It was the month of the Tucson gem shows, a series of markets and exhibitions that collectively make up the largest crystal expo in the world. More than 4,000 crystal, mineral and gemstone vendors had come to sell their wares. They were expecting more than 50,000 customers to pass through, from new age enthusiasts with thick dreadlocks and tie-dye T-shirts, to gallery owners, suited businessmen and major wholesalers. Deals done here would determine the fate of tens of thousands of tonnes of crystals, dispatching them across the US and Europe into museums and galleries, crystal healing and yoga centres, wellness retailers and Etsy stores. Five years ago, crystals were not a big deal. Now, powered by the lucrative combination of social media-friendly aesthetics, cosmic spirituality and the apparently unstoppable wellness juggernaut, they have gone from a niche oddity associated with patchouli and crushed velvet to a global consumer phenomenon. On Instagram, hashtags for #crystals and #healingcrystals tick into the tens of millions. In 2017, the New York Times heralded \u201cthe great crystal boom\u201d and in 2018 Hello! described them as the year\u2019s biggest health and wellness trend. Sold as lamps, sex toys, facial massagers or \u201cvaginal eggs\u201d hawked by Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle empire Goop, there is now a crystal for every possible occasion. As Kim Kardashian was recovering from her robbery at gunpoint in 2016, she embraced healing crystals. The model Miranda Kerr has said that she filters all her skincare products through rose quartz \u201cto give the vibration of self-love\u201d. In the US, demand for overseas crystals and gemstones has doubled over the past three years, and quartz imports have doubled since 2014. (Those numbers capture raw stone, but not the crystals imported under many other categories: jewellery, home goods, decorations.) Daniel Trinchillo, owner of Fine Minerals International, a high-end crystal dealership, told me that his business makes between $30m and $40m in sales each year. Trinchillo caters to a growing cohort of celebrities, collectors and investment buyers who want rare and valuable crystals. The most expensive single piece he has sold went for $6m, but he knows of some that have sold for $10m. Trinchillo estimates that high-end dealers now account for about $500m in annual sales. Include the lower end, he said, and you are talking about a highly profitable, multi-billion dollar industry. Believers say crystals conduct ambient energy \u2013 like miniature phone towers picking up signals and channelling them on to the user \u2013 thus rebalancing malign energies, healing the body and mind. First popularised in the west in the 1970s, crystal healing\u2019s recent resurgence has coincided with growing interest in alternative spirituality and healing practices. According to Pew Research Center data, more than 60% of US adults hold at least one \u201cnew age\u201d belief, such as placing faith in astrology or the power of psychics, and 42% think spiritual energy can be located in physical objects such as crystals. Not surprisingly, then, scientific criticism of crystal healing has done little to dim demand. Last year, Paltrow faced (and settled) a misleading advertising lawsuit for claiming that Goop\u2019s vaginal egg crystals had the power to balance hormones and regulate menstrual cycles. But still, the rise of crystals continues. Despite that explosive growth, the way the crystal industry operates has largely avoided close scrutiny. There is little in the way of fair-trade certification for crystals, and none of the industry-wide transparency schemes developed for commodities such as gold and diamonds. Tracing a crystal from the time it is dragged, dusty and cracked, from the earth, to the polished moment of final sale requires a journey backward down the supply chain: from shop, to exporter, to middleman, to mine, and finally to the men and women who work below the ground, on whose labour a billion-dollar industry has been built. * * * Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, but beneath its soil is a well-stocked treasure chest. Rose quartz and amethyst, tourmaline and citrine, labradorite and carnelian: Madagascar has them all. Gems and precious metals were the country\u2019s fastest-growing export in 2017 \u2013 up 170% from 2016, to $109m. This island country of 25 million people now stands alongside far larger nations, such as India, Brazil and China, as a key producer of crystals for the world. And in a country where infrastructure, capital and labour regulation are all in short supply, it is human bodies rather than machinery that pull crystals from the earth. While a few large mining companies operate in Madagascar, more than 80% of crystals are mined \u201cartisanally\u201d \u2013 meaning by small groups and families, without regulation, who are paid rock-bottom prices. If you want to know where the rose quartz on your shelves comes from, Anjoma Ramartina is a good place to begin. A collection of villages that sits atop some of Madagascar\u2019s largest rose quartz deposits, it is a day\u2019s drive from the capital city of Antananarivo. The further you travel from the capital, the greater the security risks. Large swathes of territory are described as \u201cred zones\u201d, considered unpoliceable by state forces. Rural villages often face raids from armed gangs known as dahalo, who steal cattle, sometimes killing, robbing or raping villagers. In January, the week we arrived in Anjoma Ramartina, three men armed with machetes were killed in a clash with village police. Do not travel or go out at night, people warned. Drive in convoy. Stay off the roads after 5pm. Most homes in Anjoma Ramartina have no electricity, no running water, no phone or network connections. Malnutrition is common. According to the World Bank, around 80% of those outside Madagascar\u2019s cities live below the $1.90-a-day poverty line. Health researchers found around half of parents in Anjoma Ramartina had lost at least one infant child to illness or hunger. As we made our way there, the driver noted that the road had recently been sealed \u2013 a vast difference from the deeply potholed gravel nearer town. \u201cThis is one of the best roads I have seen here.\u201d He laughed: \u201cHere in Madagascar, the road only gets made when there is something they want to get out.\u201d In a cool, dark room in the town council hall, Many Jean Rahandrinimaro, the deputy mayor of Anjoma Ramartina, sunk into a black vinyl couch. \u201cCrystal, amethyst, rose quartz,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything except sapphires and rubies, we mine here.\u201d He placed a few stones on the wooden table in front of him: polished clear quartz and purple amethyst. He estimated that from a population of about 10,000 people, up to a quarter of locals now depended on the mines for some income. Between two and four men died each year in the crystal pits surrounding this village, he said \u2013 only two last year, but often it was three or four. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s very dangerous but they still mine, because they want money,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s the possibility of landslide, that happens a lot here. The soil falls on them and they die.\u201d Landslides are not the only danger for miners. Smashed rocks create fine dust and quartz particles can penetrate deep into the lungs. There, they fester, inflaming surrounding cells, increasing the risk of lung cancer and silicosis. Child labour is also widespread: the US Department of Labor and the International Labour Organization estimate that about 85,000 children work in Madagascar\u2019s mines. A few days after our first meeting, I returned to the town hall. In a ruled exercise book, Many Jean traced a finger over the town\u2019s registry of deaths, tapping entries on the page: here and here, the two men who died in the mines last year, recorded in neat cursive handwriting. And here, Benoit Razafimahatratra, who had died two years earlier when he was looking for quartz at a quarry to the east. Many Jean knew where Benoit\u2019s family lived, and offered to show the way on his motorbike. Bomber jacket flapping behind him, Many Jean took us to the next village. Sitting in a small shop that sold fritters and dried fish was Jean Gregoire Randrianarisoa. He looked tired. Yes, his older brother had died, he said. \u201cWhat killed him was digging for stones, about 15 metres deep. He went into a tunnel and it collapsed from above and he was buried \u2013 someone called for help: \u2018Help! Zafimahatratra is buried down there!\u2019 That\u2019s when I went with his children to dig him up,\u201d he said. Benoit was about 55 when he died, said his widow, Josephine Rasondrina, a tiny woman, less than 5 feet tall, with hair neatly divided into braids. She brought out a photograph of him. His features had faded. Josephine gestured at her two granddaughters, about six or seven years old, sitting on the steps. \u201cSince my husband died, they stopped going to school. Since my husband died I got really tired.\u201d She raised her fingers to her temple. \u201cI am really tired. Emotionally and physically \u2013 because I have to work the field to feed my children.\u201d * * * Common crystals, such as quartz, can form almost anywhere around the world, when water and steam carry mineral particles into fractures in the earth. Drawn together by the mutual attraction of their electrical charges, their molecules stack in orderly sequences, forming defined planes and repeating facets that can create the pleasing shapes \u2013 geodes, prisms \u2013 that they\u2019re sought for. In the mineral-rich earth of central Madagascar, villagers often find quartz and citrine deposits by chance, when they are revealed by landslide or washed down to nearby riverbeds. The mines dug to meet growing demand are often improvised, operated off the books and without permits. One of these makeshift mines lies about an 18-mile hike from Anjoma Ramartina\u2019s nearest road. Rakotondrasolo, the man who villagers called the mine owner, found the site about 20 years ago, and continues to work there, along with his family, to this day. One morning, he agreed to show me the mine. Rakotondrasolo is tall and very thin. His worn flannel shirt was buttoned over a T-shirt with the face of Andry Rajoelina, Madagascar\u2019s newly elected president. (The T-shirts were everywhere, after being thrown from trucks and doled out at political rallies across the country during the 2018 election campaign.) The red dust of the landscape had worked its way into the weave of his clothing until every garment was infused with terracotta orange. As we made our way along the red dirt track to the mine, the sun was directly above, shimmeringly hot. Here and there was a sparkle among the scrubby grass: hunks of pink crystal, scattered at the path\u2019s edge. Walking behind Rakotondrasolo, his wife pointed: \u201cThe stones are beautiful,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cbut the work is very hard.\u201d Then the grass of the track ended sharply and the deep red cavern of the mine fell away in front of us. \u201cKeep away from the edge,\u201d said Rakotondrasolo, gesturing to where the ground was cracked and unstable. The pit dropped 15 metres deep, narrowing as it deepened. On the sheer face of rock were cross-hatched marks of spades and pickaxes. At the far side of the cavern, a huge pile of rose-coloured stones caught the sunlight. At the bottom, a passage disappeared, curving out of the light. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said, as we trod over the edge of the crater, \u201cthe rocks are sharp.\u201d Rose quartz cracked underfoot: jagged, gleaming, a little translucent, shining like the flesh of a fresh-filleted tuna. Later, he lifted a worn trouser leg to show the scars he had acquired from a lifetime of mining: on the right leg, where falling stones crushed his shin, and on the left where a sharp edge split the skin, requiring six stitches. At other times, this crater would have been busy with the sound of men at work \u2013 his sons and nephews, who would come to dig and then split the cost of stone they sold \u2013 but today it was silent except for Rakotondrasolo\u2019s careful footsteps. They had stopped work: rains had been heavy, and they worried that the water made the cavern less stable. \u201cI was afraid, and was afraid for my children because of this soil. It can collapse on them. I asked them to stop working here,\u201d Rakotondrasolo said. He threw in a handful of gravel and it tumbled to the bottom. Of his 10 children, seven worked with him in the mine. The boys started at the age of about 14. When they find a thick seam of quartz they smash it out of the rock, then chain the pieces together. Some blocks are small, but others are 100kg or even 200kg. The miners drag the boulders out of the hole, sometimes five people hauling together, up on to the grass embankment and toward the hill where lorries come to load them. I asked where the crystals went from there. \u201cTo the ports,\u201d Rakotondrasolo shrugged. He did not know. Somewhere overseas. A long time ago a client brought him a rose orb, cut and polished into a sphere, to show him what eventually became of some of the stones he had mined. But the buyers mostly say little about what the crystals are used for or where they end up. They pay him and leave \u2013 about 800 ariary, or 23\u00a2 a kilo, he said \u2013 17\u00a2 for lower quality. It is not much when the money is split between the men at work: 800 ariary buys a cup of rice at the village market. As Rakotondrasolo stepped away from the crater, a low hiss sounded behind him. We turned back to see a thin layer of red gravel, loosened from the wall, slide down into the hole. * * * While some mines are large, open pits, others are claustrophobically small: networks of tunnels piercing the earth. About 120 miles east of Anjoma Ramartina lies Ibity, a small village surrounded by tourmaline mines, where you have to dig deep to find stones. \u201cThe deeper you go, the more difficult it is to breathe,\u201d said Italy Miliama, a shopkeeper at the centre of the village, scooping coffee into enamel cups. \u201cOnce you see a stone, you follow it to find the other stones,\u201d said one of his friends. \u201cWe dig, dig, dig. We call it the stone way, the way of stones.\u201d The mines at Ibity spread out like an ochre moonscape. On the morning I visited, about 20 people were above ground sifting through the soil. Among them, a local miner named Jean Baptiste Rakotondravelo and his son stood barefoot, turning a large, improvised pulley. Their backs strained against the weight. A moment later, up came a large yellow jerrycan, full of red earth from below. Jean Baptiste\u2019s son carried it to his mother and young siblings and dumped it on a pile of dirt that they sifted with their fingers. The day was hot, the sun nearing its peak. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard work,\u201d Jean Baptiste said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be done by a few people. It has to be done by many.\u201d At his feet was a hole about a metre in diameter, with sheer sides like a well. Shining my torch down the hole, I couldn\u2019t see to the bottom. Every so often a faint shout echoed up from the darkness, and Jean Baptiste and his son put their backs again to pulling up the bucket. His other sons were working down there, Jean Baptiste told me, digging for tourmaline. He shrugged: \u201cGo down if you like.\u201d Near the top of the hole, it was possible to make out mosquitoes catching the light. As they turned the pulley and I descended, gripping the rope with both hands, the light retreated. The passage down was tight, the damp earth walls grazing my back, elbows and knees. Reaching the bottom, the air felt thin and it was a little harder to draw a full breath. On one side, there was a small horizontal tunnel with room only to crawl. I crouched and shouted into the darkness. \u201cSalama!\u201d two young voices called back, and deep in the tunnel, pair of dim headlamps turned to face me. Two boys blinked into the torchlight. The smallest wore a yellow cloth baseball cap, and his eyes were wide, mouth slightly open with surprise. Their names were Roland and Tavita: Jean Baptiste\u2019s sons, who he says are about 14 and 17. They started working down here two years ago, spending hours digging underground, crouching in the dark, backs curved, calves aching. Deep underground, we looked mutely at each other for a moment. Ducking into the crawl-space, I was conscious of the weight of dirt resting above us: about 19 tonnes of soil and rock, suspended only by its own natural cohesion. Roland and Tavita squatted, jamming a spade or crowbar into the soil to dislodge it and pack it into the jerrycan. When it was full they would crawl back toward the light, shoving the heavy dirt bucket ahead of them, to be dragged up top. \u201cWhen it\u2019s too long they can have difficulty breathing, so they come out,\u201d Jean Baptiste said, back at the top of the well. Above ground, the boys\u2019 mother, Odette, sat working alongside two generations of children, the youngest a fat-cheeked six-month-old girl. Odette sifted through the dirt, searching for a rock shaped differently from the rest: the small, wine-red and green crystal, tourmaline. \u201cSometimes we go months without finding any,\u201d she said. They had found just one today, about the size of a knuckle. Odette held it out to me, streaked with red dust, in the middle of her palm. At that moment, it was worth just a few cents. But in the months to come, it would slide along the global supply chain, its value multiplying with each stage of the journey. * * * For the crystals mined in Anjoma Ramartina, the path out of the country is through a company called Madagascar Specimens, which exports about 65 tonnes of carved crystals a year. At its premises, a converted house in the outer suburbs of Antananarivo, boxes of crystals were stacked against the wall. A row of shining SUVs were parked outside the house. Samples stood on the disused fireplace: carved angels, pyramids, geodes, wands. The rose quartz had been trucked in rough from Anjoma Ramartina by a local middleman, the village\u2019s former mayor, who bought large quantities from Rakotondrasolo\u2019s mine. The owner of Madagascar Specimens, Liva Marc Rahdriaharisoa, a tall man in dark jeans, wire-rimmed glasses and a navy T-shirt, gestured to the stack of boxes to his left, packed for shipping. \u201cThis, for example, is going to Canada. This to Netherlands. This to the United States,\u201d he said. He lifted the lid on a box of quartz massage wands. \u201cThese are very popular.\u201d Then another box of rose quartz hearts: \u201cSome of our best sellers,\u201d he said. \u201cCrystals are the most popular stones now \u2013 many customers are looking for it, because \u2013 I\u2019m not sure of the English \u2013 the medicine with crystals is very popular now. Like therapy, the belief crystals have healing power, you know? It\u2019s very \u2013 how do you say? \u2013 trendy.\u201d The gem and mineral expo in Tucson was a key point in Liva Marc\u2019s year. \u201cThat is where you\u2019re looking for customers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see all customers from around the world: Chinese, Japanese, New Zealand, Australian. It is the biggest market in the world. We go there to exhibit, to sell, but most important is to find customers there.\u201d Between the buyers in the US and the mines in Madagascar was a gulf of experience, which, sitting in the courtyard of Liva Marc\u2019s small factory, he found hard to express. \u201cIt\u2019s like two galaxies,\u201d he said, grinning and shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a big difference. If I say to people at the mine what Tuscon is like, they will never understand. And if I say to the Tucson people to come here, they will never understand. It\u2019s very different worlds.\u201d He acknowledged the poor conditions at the mines he bought from. \u201cYou were shocked, but I was shocked, too! When you see in the rough, [stones weighing] like 50kg, 60kg, they drag it four, five kilometres, two or three per day, and earning only $1? You know, it\u2019s \u2026 \u201d He paused. \u201cSometimes you can\u2019t imagine how they can do this.\u201d Madagascar Specimens exports some crystals rough, but its workshop in Antananarivo also works the stones, cutting them into shapes, grinding and polishing the faces. From Liva Marc\u2019s perspective, refining the stone in Madagascar means creating steady jobs and keeping more of the value of the crystals in the country. With stone that was exported rough and then carved in China or the US, almost none of the profit stayed in Madagascar. \u201cMaybe they [shops in the US] don\u2019t explain it to their customers. It\u2019s business for them, they want money. They will never say: \u2018I buy this for $1 and I sell to you for $1,000\u2019,\u201d he laughed, \u201cbut that\u2019s the reality.\u201d The plunder of Madagascar\u2019s resources for profit is nothing new. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the country was a source of slaves, bought by Europeans and sent to work in brutal conditions, often on sugar plantations on the islands of Mauritius, R\u00e9union and Rodrigues. When the French colonised Madagascar in 1895, they outlawed slavery, but ushered in a new era of forced labour and extraction, with tens of thousands of tonnes of rosewood and millions of francs\u2019 worth of gold shipped offshore each year. More than a century later, the country\u2019s riches still rarely benefit the Malagasy people, says Zo Andriamaro, a sociologist and human rights analyst. Gold, cobalt, sapphires, crystals: she sees them all as part of the same old story, resources siphoned out of the country for the benefit of foreign companies. \u201cThere has to be some more systematic way of controlling and regulating the market for all types of minerals coming from here,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is totally unjust.\u201d Mining also threatens Madagascar\u2019s rainforest. When new mining sites are discovered, sometimes thousands of men migrate to mine, encroaching on protected environmental areas and threatening the survival of endangered species. Embracing mining on a larger scale is \u201cintrinsically, fundamentally unsustainable and destructive\u201d, Andriamaro says. \u201cYou can never pretend that you will restore the environment to its initial state.\u201d * * * The month after we spoke in Madagascar, Liva Marc and a shipping container full of his stones landed in Arizona, bound for the Tucson shows. I met him in a hotel lobby, one of three retail spots he had in the city. Business was good, he said. Buyers from all over the world had come. The stalls around him showcased towering display pieces: rose quartz boulders, massive amethyst geodes. They had been cleaned, polished and set on display, but he still looked at them and thought of their origins. \u201cAll these big pieces \u2013 imagine how they must dig it. How difficult it must be,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine how it starts.\u201d While the crystal business is booming, and largely among consumers who tend to be concerned with environmental impact, fair trade and good intentions, there is little sign of the kind of regulation that might improve conditions for those who mine them. Julia Schoen, co-founder of the crystal drink bottle company Glacce (tagline \u201cLuxury Spiritual\u201d) told me that ethical sourcing is \u201cthe No 1 priority\u201d for her company. Schoen was speaking on the phone from her office in New Orleans, where she told me she was surrounded by crystals that had been unboxed and laid out, waiting to be blessed by staff, who would burn sage smudge sticks and pray to cleanse them before use. Glacce sells water bottles and metal straws embedded with rose quartz, amethyst and other crystals, which are supposed to transform ordinary water into a \u201ccrystal elixir\u201d, where the water takes on the healing properties of the crystal. The bottles were touted by Vanity Fair as \u201c2018\u2019s Status Symbol\u201d and are sold by bohemian-themed fashion retailer Free People, as well as Goop. Schoen said sales of the bottles, which retail for $60-$100, had increased exponentially since they started the business, and demand often outstripped supply. But even with a booming market, she said, the company didn\u2019t yet have a budget to track their crystals to their source at the mines. Instead, Glacce depended on Chinese middlemen to select crystals, including those from Madagascar. Schoen told me that Glacce\u2019s suppliers \u201cknow that we do not want to be having our money go towards a mine that\u2019s using child labour. They know all these things.\u201d At present, she said, they considered transparency a high priority and hoped to develop relationships with individual mines by 2020, but could offer no concrete reassurances about the current conditions of their miners. \u201cIn an industry that has not been so regulated and maybe hasn\u2019t had so many eyeballs on it, there are obviously practices that most people who are purchasing crystals would not want to know about,\u201d Schoen acknowledged. \u201cYou know, at the end of the day it\u2019s like, our intentions are \u2013 \u201d she paused. \u201cI think we\u2019re clear what our intentions are.\u201d The challenge of sourcing crystals ethically is one faced by the industry as a whole: Glacce, Goop or any given Etsy vendor are no more culpable than the next crystal dealer. Every retailer I spoke to raised the question of price. Would crystal consumers really be willing to pay more to guarantee safer, child labour-free mines, or a fair wage for miners? Schoen compared it to the organic food movement: if enough people wanted assurance of their products\u2019 provenance, the supply systems would develop. At Tuscon, in the marquee for crystal vendor The Village Silversmith, I asked owner John Bajoras \u2013 tall, tanned and broad-shouldered, with an enormous shark tooth around his neck \u2013 where the responsibility lay if crystals were coming from mines where people, many of them children, were risking their lives for meagre pay. It is all about the customers, Bajoras said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete conundrum. I get somebody with dreadlocks, and a peace-hippie attitude, and you try to sell them a piece of labradorite from Madagascar for $12. And they\u2019re like: \u2018I\u2019ll give you $6, dude.\u2019 That\u2019s where the fucking problem is. If they were like \u2018It\u2019s $12? Well, how about I give you $20?\u2019 [then] you could kick $8 back down the line, sure. That\u2019s the problem. The problem is your end consumer. Not anybody else in the pipeline. The end consumer is the person who sets the price.\u201d Bajoras visited Madagascar often, but rarely made it out to the mines, opting instead to deal with middlemen in the cities. But he knew the villages of Anjoma Ramartina and Ibity: \u201cYeah. All our rose quartz comes from that area. All the tourmaline comes from there,\u201d he said. And if some of the conditions are truly awful? \u201cAwful is relative, remember,\u201d he shot back. The volume of his voice rose slightly, but he was still smiling. \u201cYour job looks horrible to me. I feel for you. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re willing to do it, because we need people like you to do it, but I ain\u2019t fuckin\u2019 doing it, no way. I would rather die in a mine, any day, no doubt. Holy shit. No. Not happening. Spell check? You\u2019re out of your fucking mind.\u201d Meanwhile, the $4.2tn wellness industry rolls on, bolstered by profits from cheap crystals and a generation looking for alternative modes of healing. Bajoras was confident his stones had healing power. After all, he said, if uranium could kill you, why shouldn\u2019t lithium quartz be able to help cure your depression? And when you broke it down to an elemental level, he said, people are mostly minerals and water anyway. \u201cYou\u2019re hydrated mineral powder,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou are! You\u2019re like Kool-Aid.\u201d Beneath a tented canopy beside the Tucson freeway, his colleague Alexa Stamison was selling an array of Madagascan rose quartz, carnelian and amethyst. Stamison had a warm, open manner and an encyclopedic knowledge of their stones. A woman dressed all in white \u2013 crocheted shirt, maxi skirt and headscarf draped over her top-knot \u2013 approached the stall. \u201cHow much is this carnelian?\u201d she asked. The stone was $30. A stone of empowerment, Stamison told me, great for women going out on their own or moving into a new home. \u201cI think I need it, it was just calling to me and I couldn\u2019t walk away,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI don\u2019t need a bag, I\u2019ll just carry it.\u201d She walked away, cradling the stone. If anything, Stamison wonders if the circumstances of miners in Madagascar, \u201cmakes the pieces a lot more special. Because I know some person in a little baby hut was actually polishing it by hand, and they\u2019re setting their intentions into it, too,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople\u2019s intentions and people\u2019s energy are put into the stones as they\u2019re producing it.\u201d \u201cSo the circumstances they\u2019re mined in, they are embedded into the stone somehow?\u201d I asked. \u201cI think so. A little bit, it has to be. It has to be.\u201d Additional research by Holifeno Hantanrinoro and Teddy Rahenintsoa \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

But it did demonstrate how thoroughly Israel has dominated and subdued the Palestinian population under its occupation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95ab271b7fc5b295fb0d2fc34a6e8fee3517514b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95ab271b7fc5b295fb0d2fc34a6e8fee3517514b/0_256_5016_3010/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Palestinian man demonstrating against occupation, in the village of Kafr Malik north east of Ramallah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Palestinian man demonstrating against occupation, in the village of Kafr Malik north east of Ramallah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every time I return to Ramallah after a few weeks away, I\u2019m struck by how much my world has shrunk. Movement between Palestinian cities is restricted, and travel to Gaza impossible. Gaza is about 50 miles away from Ramallah; I have not visited for 19 years. The Oslo accords divided Palestinian territory into three categories. \u201cArea C\u201d is under Israeli control, \u201cArea B\u201d is under joint security control by Israel and the Palestinians, and \u201cArea A\u201d \u2013 the smallest \u2013 is administered by the Palestinian authority.</p> <p>Since Donald Trump became US president, the Israeli settlers in the West Bank have hastened their takeover of more and more Palestinian territory in the areas under Israeli administration \u2013 including the land around Ramallah. No longer do the settlers justify this by the law of the land as Israel interprets it, nor by Israeli court decisions. It is now simply the Bible. They declare: \u201cThis land is ours even if the Palestinian can present proof of ownership, because God gave it to us.\u201d</p> <p>Ramallah is now the de facto capital of the struggling Palestinian Authority. It suffers from overcrowding but enjoys none of the benefits of statehood. A few days before our return, the head of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, declared that it would <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/.premium-pa-decides-to-end-division-of-west-bank-into-areas-set-by-oslo-accords-1.7772503\" title=\"\">cancel the division of the land into three \u201careas\u201d</a> and put the whole West Bank under PA sovereignty. But this was a hollow declaration, and the PA will be forbidden from implementing it. In July, Israel demolished dozens of Palestinian apartments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/22/israeli-crews-demolish-palestinian-homes-in-east-jerusalem\" title=\"\">in an East Jerusalem neighbourhood</a> where the PA is supposed to control planning \u2013 and the authority was powerless to stop it.</p> <p>Last week Netanyahu promised that if re-elected he would annex one-third of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley, the West Bank\u2019s most fertile area. This was another election stunt: in reality, annexing the land will change nothing. It is already under total Israeli control, and the settlers who live there enjoy all the rights and privileges of Israeli citizenship.</p> <p>I\u2019ve returned carrying a large number of books because ordering one takes many months \u2013 if it ever arrives. But it isn\u2019t only books that are delayed. The mail that has to go through Israel is barely functioning. Living conditions in my hometown under Israeli occupation are going from bad to worse with the economic exploitation by Israel proceeding unchallenged. Most vegetables and fruits that we used to buy from local greengrocers were local produce. Now they are mainly Israeli and often are grown on Palestinian land that the settlements now cultivate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/raja-shehadeh-ramallah-palestine-israel-occupation-struggle-failure-to-liberate\">\u2018Look where we\u2019ve got to \u2013 defeated and dominated\u2019: my generation\u2019s failure to liberate Palestine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among Palestinians, despair is widespread. \u201cThe times are rotten,\u201d my nephew Aziz told me upon my return, echoing Hamlet. There is growing awareness here that Israel\u2019s international campaign to demonise criticism of its colonial policies as a form of antisemitism is succeeding. And there is no hope to be found in Israel: none of the parties contesting the elections on Tuesday are talking about the occupation or proposing how to end it. Instead they are competing to see who can promise the most to the settlers.</p> <p>This is the gloomy political atmosphere to which I have returned. I shall miss the walks in Edinburgh\u2019s parks and the green hills around it. I had hoped that we could spare one of the hills around Ramallah and turn it into a park. But given the scarcity of the land left here to grow, this proved impossible. This congested city is left with no open areas to breathe, and with few of its traditional buildings and trees that gave the place its character.</p> <p>After a month away, I found my garden had lost much of its greenery except for the plumbago \u2013 which I found in full bloom. I will revive what can be saved, and in the future concentrate on planting only drought-resistant shrubs. And I must try to remember what I have learned during more than 50 years of occupation, about how to live here on my own terms without losing myself to hatred or anger. For whoever gets elected in Israel this week, it will make no difference to our future in this land.</p> <p>\u2022 Raja Shehadeh is a Palestinian writer and lawyer.

Since Donald Trump became US president, the Israeli settlers in the West Bank have hastened their takeover of more and more Palestinian territory in the areas under Israeli administration \u2013 including the land around Ramallah. No longer do the settlers justify this by the law of the land as Israel interprets it, nor by Israeli court decisions. It is now simply the Bible. They declare: \u201cThis land is ours even if the Palestinian can present proof of ownership, because God gave it to us.\u201d Ramallah is now the de facto capital of the struggling Palestinian Authority. It suffers from overcrowding but enjoys none of the benefits of statehood. A few days before our return, the head of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, declared that it would cancel the division of the land into three \u201careas\u201d and put the whole West Bank under PA sovereignty. But this was a hollow declaration, and the PA will be forbidden from implementing it. In July, Israel demolished dozens of Palestinian apartments in an East Jerusalem neighbourhood where the PA is supposed to control planning \u2013 and the authority was powerless to stop it. Last week Netanyahu promised that if re-elected he would annex one-third of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley, the West Bank\u2019s most fertile area. This was another election stunt: in reality, annexing the land will change nothing. It is already under total Israeli control, and the settlers who live there enjoy all the rights and privileges of Israeli citizenship. I\u2019ve returned carrying a large number of books because ordering one takes many months \u2013 if it ever arrives. But it isn\u2019t only books that are delayed. The mail that has to go through Israel is barely functioning. Living conditions in my hometown under Israeli occupation are going from bad to worse with the economic exploitation by Israel proceeding unchallenged. Most vegetables and fruits that we used to buy from local greengrocers were local produce. Now they are mainly Israeli and often are grown on Palestinian land that the settlements now cultivate. Among Palestinians, despair is widespread. \u201cThe times are rotten,\u201d my nephew Aziz told me upon my return, echoing Hamlet. There is growing awareness here that Israel\u2019s international campaign to demonise criticism of its colonial policies as a form of antisemitism is succeeding. And there is no hope to be found in Israel: none of the parties contesting the elections on Tuesday are talking about the occupation or proposing how to end it. Instead they are competing to see who can promise the most to the settlers. This is the gloomy political atmosphere to which I have returned. I shall miss the walks in Edinburgh\u2019s parks and the green hills around it. I had hoped that we could spare one of the hills around Ramallah and turn it into a park. But given the scarcity of the land left here to grow, this proved impossible. This congested city is left with no open areas to breathe, and with few of its traditional buildings and trees that gave the place its character. After a month away, I found my garden had lost much of its greenery except for the plumbago \u2013 which I found in full bloom. I will revive what can be saved, and in the future concentrate on planting only drought-resistant shrubs. And I must try to remember what I have learned during more than 50 years of occupation, about how to live here on my own terms without losing myself to hatred or anger. For whoever gets elected in Israel this week, it will make no difference to our future in this land. \u2022 Raja Shehadeh is a Palestinian writer and lawyer.

I\u2019m a sucker for your communist website.</p> <p><strong>What are your</strong><strong> memories of making The Visitors? </strong>It was a super time. I\u2019d just been divorced and I was falling massively in love \u2013 it was like a Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. I first got to know Rokeby when I did a performance piece there called Folk Song. My friend knew the people who lived there. I really wanted to do something else, though the idea never really looked good on paper: just making a sentimental country song with my friends in this really great place.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igof7jUIaaE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Igof7jUIaaE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igof7jUIaaE\">Watch a video extract of The Visitors</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>How do residents</strong><strong> </strong><strong>feel about their place being immortalised</strong><strong>? </strong>They felt good. It\u2019s really an ode to this house and the life that\u2019s lived there. All the places around it are now owned by super-rich Google people or they are museums. This is the only one that is super alive. It\u2019s this hippy place, in a good way. Hippies doing pagan ceremonies, fantastic. American history is in that house. The Visitors is part of its era, though. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d make a piece like this now because we live in much darker times. I was in love with America, Obama was president, the whole thing is a love song to the country. There was a lot of liberal optimism in those days and that somehow is captured in the piece.</p> <p><strong>Did it take a lot of rehearsal? </strong>We stayed there for a week and me and Dav\u00ed\u00f0 \u00de\u00f3r J\u00f3nsson, who plays the piano, made a plan for the song, and we spent a week in the big ballroom rehearsing, creating this sort of opus. Then we got in the cameras, set up the gear, and just went for it. We did two takes: a try-out then <em>the </em>take.</p> <p><strong>The repetition isn\u2019t boring \u2013 how did you pull that off? </strong>Well, usually I really like boring repetition, but when we were arranging it we were interested in doing it in a more narrative way. The material just called for that \u2013 maybe it was the feeling of being there in this band for a week. It made us create more of an opus than a repeated loop.</p> <p><strong>How did you work out who took which role? </strong>I was really creating my dream band from the Reykjavik music scene. Everyone in there is a legend or a friend from different bands. I wanted to document this vibe in my generation. The Visitors was shot at this tender moment where our youth is just about to go. It\u2019s almost like the last day of our youth. I was 36. Not a <em>youth</em> youth.

You really feel like a gilded-age person in the bathtub.</p> <p><strong>What happened after you all wandered into the horizon at the end of the video? </strong>We went back in the house and got hammered. We had a great party with the people who are on the terrace in the piece \u2013 the family that lives in the house and the tenants who live around it. We made a feast and I can remember in the early morning hours us blasting Wagner through the keytar amp. It was all very lovely.</p> <p><strong>Did you ever hear from Abba about this work, since it\u2019s named after their final LP?</strong>Frida and Agnetha have never said anything! They probably don\u2019t know about it. The piece has never been shown in Scandinavia, although it will be this October. The Visitors album is really hardcore melancholic Abba. There was this Icelandic death metal band called HAM who used to cover Abba songs and that\u2019s how I got into them. My parents were hardcore socialists and of course they described Abba as bubblegum pop. [Laughs] I\u2019m such a big Abba fan. They\u2019re hardcore non-sellouts: Leonard Cohen did ads for Armani and Bob Dylan for Victoria\u2019s Secret, but Abba funded the Swedish feminist party [Benny Andersson donated 1m kronor to Feminist Initiative in 2009].</p> <p><strong>This artwork has been described as \u2018selfie-proof\u2019 </strong>I think it\u2019s a good thing that it can\u2019t be shared online, it\u2019s really about spatial experience. I was surprised that a lot of people watched the whole thing. I never usually intend my video pieces to be watched right through, but I suppose there\u2019s something about the narrative and the music and the cannon part that really draws you in. The cannon was like Tchaikovsky\u2019s 1812 overture.

This artwork has been described as \u2018selfie-proof\u2019 I think it\u2019s a good thing that it can\u2019t be shared online, it\u2019s really about spatial experience. I was surprised that a lot of people watched the whole thing. I never usually intend my video pieces to be watched right through, but I suppose there\u2019s something about the narrative and the music and the cannon part that really draws you in. The cannon was like Tchaikovsky\u2019s 1812 overture. That\u2019s my favourite thing: \u201cBring on the cannon!\u201d Is The Visitors your favourite work? It has a special place in my heart, but it was such a feelgood piece that I had to make some really dark shit afterwards. No artist has a favourite piece. Maybe you can pick one when you\u2019re really old \u2013 but it\u2019s something I\u2019m super proud of. It took on a life of its own. And now it\u2019s the best artwork of the 21st century. What the hell is that about? [Laughs uproariously] Of course nobody thinks lists like this matter \u2013 unless you\u2019re on them.",

Poet Anne Carson and actor Stephen Dillane move through the world on an imaginary day, as the sun is eclipsed. Set in multiple locations and weathers (Bodmin Moor, Yellowstone Park, Wyoming and Illinois), and with innovative technical manipulations (the entire film was edited in-camera), atmospheres and startling imagery, the whole thing is a delight. <strong>AS </strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/14/tacita-dean-landscape-review-a-total-eclipse-of-the-senses\">Read the review</a>.</p> <h2>24 <strong>Andreas Gursky<br></strong>Amazon (2016)</h2> <p>Andreas Gursky makes photographs but not as we know them. The scale of his composite digital images is vast, their detail hyperreal. He is the photographic artist of our time, whether capturing the frenzied activity of the Chicago stock exchange or a painterly vista of the Rhine \u2013 a manipulated landscape that does not exist in real life. The extraordinary Amazon offers a glimpse of a single day\u2019s orders stacked in a giant warehouse. A glimpse of the scale, if not the labour, of 21st-century global commerce. <strong>SOH<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/26/andreas-gurskys-amazon-exposing-the-mindlessly-cruel-forces-of-global-capitalism\">Read more here</a>.</p> <h2>23 <strong>Tanja Ostoji\u0107</strong><br>Looking for a Husband with EU Passport (2000-05)</h2> <p>Born in the former Yugoslavia, Tanja Ostoji\u0107 refuses to claim a nationality. In 2000, she advertised online \u2013 using a brutal, shaven-headed and naked photograph of herself \u2013 for a husband with an EU Passport. Eventually she met and married a German in a performance in Belgrade. With him, she moved to D\u00fcsseldorf. Later, the couple celebrated their divorce.

So asks Wolfgang Tillmans. Soon after becoming the first photographer to win the Turner prize in 2000, Tillmans started experimenting with picture-making that skipped camera, negative and subject, produced by exposing photographic paper to handheld light sources in the darkroom. The Freischwimmer<em> </em>series has a cool liquid quality: vast prints apparently depicting tiny dots of coloured liquid tumbling and trailing through water. In fact they are images of nothing more than their own production: oddly honest for an age in which you can seldom trust your eyes. <strong>HJ<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/26/wolfgang-tillmans-serpentine-photographs-exhibition\">Read more here</a>.</p> <h2>20 <strong>Tania Bruguera</strong><br>Tatlin\u2019s Whisper #5 (2008)</h2> <p>Two uniformed mounted policemen and their horses move among the audience, using crowd-control techniques. An exercise in power, this work is as much sculptural as it is a performance, or an equestrian ballet. The smell of the horses, their scale in a contained space, the often unspoken marshalling, the uncertainty of whether you are audience or subject: the Cuban artist regards this 2008 performance as a vignette, but it is so much more. <strong>AS<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/11/tania-bruguera-samuel-beckett-endgame-boca-porto\">Read more here</a>.</p> <h2>19 <strong>Sarah Lucas</strong><br>God Is Dad (2005)</h2> <p>A snaking cable, some small lightbulbs and a distorted, dangling pair of pale tights hang from a bent coathanger suspended by spindly wire from the ceiling.

This prince, well versed in new philosophies, set aside painting and video art and decreed the exhibition a social laboratory. One thousand and one citizens of China would travel by his side as both audience and exhibit. And the prince constructed a great dormitory, matching wheelie suitcases and coloured bracelets, that by these tokens the citizens of Kassel might know the citizens of China, and welcome them. And all lived happily ever after (apart from the Prince of Protest, who was arrested four years later and imprisoned for 81 days by his own government). <strong>HJ</strong></p> <h2>16 <strong>Chris Ofili</strong><br>The Upper Room (2002)</h2> <p>This cycle of 14 paintings, all based on an Andy Warhol sketch of a monkey, and assembled in a specially constructed and lit room in collaboration with architect David Adjaye, was a breakthrough work for Chris Ofili.

Shot on an abandoned satellite \u201cresolution target\u201d in the California desert, How Not to Be Seen is conceptually intense, but retains the daffiness of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-M2hs3sXGo\">Monty Python sketch</a> that inspired it.

Birds sing, cars go by, people fold washing as she tramps back alleys and country lanes, city streets and unmade paths. Nothing happens in the film. It has already happened, in bucolic villages and city side-streets. The film lasts a long time, dwelling on the past\u2019s persistence in the present.

Eliasson\u2019s hallucinatory installation in the Tate Turbine Hall had people lying on the floor, mellowing out to his shimmering recreation of a Turneresque sky inside the museum. He would be very good at staging a Pink Floyd reunion. But in fact he is a very thoughtful artist, fascinated by colour, light and the fragile state of nature.

The Visitors is a live performance, each musician visible on a different screen. Outside, there is a party on the porch, where the house\u2019s current occupants take in the early evening. Captured in real time, one evening at sunset, the music builds and dies and builds again. The song repeats and develops, reaches false crescendos and plateaus. Ragnar, in the bath, is nearly submerged in soap bubbles as he sings, \u201cOnce again I\u2019m falling into my feminine ways.\u201d \u201cThere are stars exploding around you / And there is nothing / Nothing you can do,\u201d goes another refrain, in this idyllic crumbling retreat.

The film\u2019s absurdities and longeurs, the light, and the concentration of all the performers and the repetition of the song is utterly compelling and hypnotic. Youthfulness and idealism feel like a fading dream in the evening\u2019s light. The Visitors is a kind of extended farewell to romanticism, to which Ragnar is both drawn and deeply suspicious of. Writing this, I want to see The Visitors again, immediately. <strong>AS<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/28/ragnar-kjartansson-interview-iceland-barbican-the-visitors\">Read more here</a>.</p>",

Poet Anne Carson and actor Stephen Dillane move through the world on an imaginary day, as the sun is eclipsed. Set in multiple locations and weathers (Bodmin Moor, Yellowstone Park, Wyoming and Illinois), and with innovative technical manipulations (the entire film was edited in-camera), atmospheres and startling imagery, the whole thing is a delight. AS Read the review. 24 Andreas Gursky Amazon (2016) Andreas Gursky makes photographs but not as we know them. The scale of his composite digital images is vast, their detail hyperreal. He is the photographic artist of our time, whether capturing the frenzied activity of the Chicago stock exchange or a painterly vista of the Rhine \u2013 a manipulated landscape that does not exist in real life. The extraordinary Amazon offers a glimpse of a single day\u2019s orders stacked in a giant warehouse. A glimpse of the scale, if not the labour, of 21st-century global commerce.

In 2000, she advertised online \u2013 using a brutal, shaven-headed and naked photograph of herself \u2013 for a husband with an EU Passport. Eventually she met and married a German in a performance in Belgrade. With him, she moved to D\u00fcsseldorf. Later, the couple celebrated their divorce. A prescient exploration of how human transactions are conducted online, and using EU law as an artistic medium. AS 22 Steve McQueen Illuminer (2001) Lit only by the flickering light of a television programme about US navy seals deployed in Aghanistan, McQueen thrashes on his hotel bed, illuminated by violence, the soundtrack erupting with noise. His camera, on top of the telly, watches him struggling in the gloom. Little more than a filmed sketch, a situation grasped, Illuminer nevertheless has everything, and is a lesson in being able to make work anywhere, anytime. AS 21 Wolfgang Tillmans Freischwimmer (2003-present) Humans have made pictures for millennia \u2013 why get hung up on how they are made? So asks Wolfgang Tillmans. Soon after becoming the first photographer to win the Turner prize in 2000, Tillmans started experimenting with picture-making that skipped camera, negative and subject, produced by exposing photographic paper to handheld light sources in the darkroom. The Freischwimmer series has a cool liquid quality: vast prints apparently depicting tiny dots of coloured liquid tumbling and trailing through water. In fact they are images of nothing more than their own production: oddly honest for an age in which you can seldom trust your eyes. HJ Read more here. 20 Tania Bruguera Tatlin\u2019s Whisper #5 (2008) Two uniformed mounted policemen and their horses move among the audience, using crowd-control techniques. An exercise in power, this work is as much sculptural as it is a performance, or an equestrian ballet. The smell of the horses, their scale in a contained space, the often unspoken marshalling, the uncertainty of whether you are audience or subject: the Cuban artist regards this 2008 performance as a vignette, but it is so much more. AS Read more here. 19 Sarah Lucas God Is Dad (2005) A snaking cable, some small lightbulbs and a distorted, dangling pair of pale tights hang from a bent coathanger suspended by spindly wire from the ceiling. The pantyhose feet droop, midair. The lights are a sign of life. Whether hanged or floating, dangling or soaring, Lucas\u2019s figure is full of pathos and humour, both miserable and transcendent. Her sense of materiality, and fragility, is pitch-perfect here. AS Read more here. 18 Arthur Jafa The White Album (2018) Oneohtrix Point Never and Iggy Pop; CCTV footage of Dylann Roof calmly entering the Charleston church where he killed nine worshippers; American drone strikes in Iraq and helicopter footage of a black man being beaten by cops during the 1992 LA riots; former redneck racist YouTuber Dixon White discussing white fear and guilt; and a young woman tying herself in knots as she denies her own racism \u2026 with its shocking juxtapositions, Arthur Jafa\u2019s gut-wrenching montage deals in contradiction, a kind of call and response of different voices and different tempos. AS Read more here. 17 Ai Weiwei Fairytale (2007) Once upon a time, Beijing\u2019s mighty Prince of Protest was invited by the burghers of Kassel to display his art at a quinquennial exhibition thought the finest in any land. This prince, well versed in new philosophies, set aside painting and video art and decreed the exhibition a social laboratory. One thousand and one citizens of China would travel by his side as both audience and exhibit. And the prince constructed a great dormitory, matching wheelie suitcases and coloured bracelets, that by these tokens the citizens of Kassel might know the citizens of China, and welcome them. And all lived happily ever after (apart from the Prince of Protest, who was arrested four years later and imprisoned for 81 days by his own government). HJ 16 Chris Ofili The Upper Room (2002) This cycle of 14 paintings, all based on an Andy Warhol sketch of a monkey, and assembled in a specially constructed and lit room in collaboration with architect David Adjaye, was a breakthrough work for Chris Ofili. Tate\u2019s purchase of the work proved controversial, but it would probably have been split up otherwise. With its drifts of glitter, its gorgeous colour and detail, its humour and elephant dung, it pointed the way to an expansive, immersive narrative approach Ofili has continued to develop. I was astonished. AS 15 Hito Steyerl How Not to Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File (2013) Starting with the basic, pressing question of how to evade surveillance in a world read through moving images, Hito Steyerl\u2019s influential video picks apart what it means to disappear. If surveillance feels grossly invasive, how do we feel about the invisibility afforded to the vastly wealthy? What about the invisibility bestowed by a burqa, systemic bigotry, or extraordinary rendition? Shot on an abandoned satellite \u201cresolution target\u201d in the California desert, How Not to Be Seen is conceptually intense, but retains the daffiness of the Monty Python sketch that inspired it. An artist and theorist both, Steyerl beguiles us into contemplating uncomfortable questions with wit and charm.

Tino Sehgal\u2019s magnificent performance piece takes place in near total darkness. Performers stamp and sing, whisper, holler and dance. They go through little routines, songs and riffs as the viewer stumbles among and between them. Sometimes there is a confrontation and sometimes unnerving quiet. Wildly exhilarating, This Variation concerns presence and presentness, and what it means to be a spectator. AS Read more here. 13 Susan Hiller J Street Project (2002-05) While living in Berlin, Susan Hiller travelled Germany, photographing and filming every street sign and location still prefixed by the word Juden (Jew), finding 303 Judenstrasses and Judengrasses. Birds sing, cars go by, people fold washing as she tramps back alleys and country lanes, city streets and unmade paths. Nothing happens in the film. It has already happened, in bucolic villages and city side-streets. The film lasts a long time, dwelling on the past\u2019s persistence in the present. The camera is unwavering as the world turns, oblivious. AS Read more here. 12 John Akomfrah The Unfinished Conversation (2012) A moving, beautiful, mournful and uplifting three-channel portrait of the lives and times of Stuart Hall. Talent meets talent, words meet images and postwar England meets its wisest cultural thinker in this wonderfully deft work. Using more than 800 hours of audio and TV material from Hall\u2019s own archive, Akomfrah takes us from Hall\u2019s Jamaican childhood to a grey postwar London. But the real concern is the malleability of identities, how we are formed and the endless task of reinventing ourselves. AS Read more here. 11 Olafur Eliasson The Weather Project (2003) The sun indoors ... what\u2019s not to like? Eliasson\u2019s hallucinatory installation in the Tate Turbine Hall had people lying on the floor, mellowing out to his shimmering recreation of a Turneresque sky inside the museum. He would be very good at staging a Pink Floyd reunion. But in fact he is a very thoughtful artist, fascinated by colour, light and the fragile state of nature. This unforgettable spectacle was the most over-the-top in a string of dazzling installations and interventions that have proved Elisasson one of the century\u2019s most significant artists. JJ Read more here. 10 Gerhard Richter September (2005) Based on a photograph in Der Spiegel, Richter\u2019s small painting depicts the moment the second passenger jet flew into the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001, consuming the building in a fireball. The painting is as small as the TV screens people were glued to that day. The image is interrupted, almost swiped away by paint, recognising the impossibility of comprehending the enormity of the moment. AS 9 Yael Bartana And Europe Will Be Stunned (2007-11) Taking as its premise a call for more than three million Jews to return to Poland, land of their forefathers, to save the country from being only for \u201cPolish Poles in Poland\u201d, Yael Bartana\u2019s film trilogy plays on and inverts nationalist sentiment, EU and old-style Communist party rhetoric, Zionist dreams, the holocaust and the Palestinian right to return. With escalating irony, shock and pithy humour, Bartana takes on the world. AS Read the review. 8 Doris Salcedo Shibboleth (2007) Having been cut into the floor of Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall, the Colombian artist\u2019s 2007 work is still partly visible in the concrete, like an old scar. It zigzagged down the ramp like a small canyon, or the remains of an earthquake. Shibboleth evoked division, a flaw. \u201cIt represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred,\u201d Salcedo said. \u201cThe space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.\u201d How of our moment Shibboleth remains. AS Read more here. 7 Wael Shawky Cabaret Crusades (2010-15) Loosely inspired by Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf\u2019s The Crusades Through Arab Eyes, Egyptian artist Wael Shawky\u2019s film trilogy is a cycle of plotting and betrayal, slaughter and poetry. Using puppets \u2013 some extremely old, many made in clay or Murano glass \u2013 Shawky delights, ravishes and informs at every turn. It is hard to keep up with all the shenanigans between Shia and Sunni, and the duplicitous divisions and squabbles of the Christian invaders, regarded by Arab commentators of the time as uncivilised barbarians. AS Read more here. 6 Christian Marclay The Clock (2010) Christian Marclay has described his 24-hour video montage as an albatross, which is perhaps the artist\u2019s loss and our gain. But few will have seen the entire work, with its approximately 12,000 cinema clips spanning its 24-hour entirety. A tour-de-force of borrowed movie footage, The Clock is cinema\u2019s great timepiece, always synchronised to the real time wherever it is shown. Following the diurnal rhythms of everyday life, it is by turns perky, sexy, conspiratorial, manic, exhausted and sullen. Knowing it is there is almost enough. AS Read more here. 5 Teresa Margolles What Else Could We Talk About? (2009) Once a day, a young man mopped the floors and steps of a Venetian Palazzo with rags soaked in the blood of victims of Mexican violence and murder. Teresa Margolles\u2019s Limpieza (Cleaning), part of her larger work at the Mexico Pavilion at the 2009 Venice Biennale, was both an everyday routine and a bleak response to both state and criminal violence. Both washing and sullying the floors, Limpieza was emphatic, unforgettable, tragic and tender. AS 4 Pussy Riot Punk Prayer (2012) There\u2019s a lot of weak political art out there: sophisticated, modish, after-the-factish art that broadcasts liberal values to a liberal audience. Pussy Riot\u2019s performance of Punk Prayer occupies the opposite pole: feminist, explicitly anti-Putin, protesting the banning of gay pride and the Orthodox church\u2019s support of the president. Staged by the brightly masked punk collective in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, it got members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina arrested and imprisoned. The after-image of their performance still lingers as a powerful \u2013 and immaculately constructed \u2013 symbol of defiance in the face of freedoms lost. HJ Read more here. 3 Pierre Huyghe Untilled (2011-12) Garden, wilderness, installation and performance, Pierre Huyghe\u2019s work for Documenta in 2011 felt like an elegy for a dying world. Among great stands of nettles, strange plants of all descriptions flourished: nightshade and Afghan poppies, aphrodisiacs, poisons and psychotropic plants. In a clearing beside a pond sat a bronze statue of a reclining woman whose head was a living nest of bees. Two lithe greyhounds, one of whom had a leg that had been dyed pink, wandered about. \u201cLive things and inanimate things, made and not made,\u201d read Huyghe\u2019s description of this wondrous work.

Ragnar understood her lyrics as a commentary on what he calls the \u201ccommon defeat\u201d of their marriage. The music was co-written by Kjartansson and his frequent collaborator Dav\u00ed\u00f0 \u00de\u00f3r J\u00f3nsson.

The company announced the release of Ms Monopoly last week, \u201cthe first-ever game where women make more than men\u201d.</p> <p>The game attempts to flip gender inequality on its head: female players collect $240 when they pass go, while men collect only $200. It\u2019s a concept that feels like deliberate catnip for online outrage.</p> <p>\u201cAt Hasbro, we have always believed in promoting equality and inclusion across our business and our product,\u201d said Kristina Timmins, a spokeswoman for the company. \u201cThat\u2019s why we decided to give the franchise a new mascot: Ms Monopoly, an advocate whose mission is to invest in female entrepreneurs. We want to recognize and celebrate the many contributions women have made to our society and continue to make on a daily basis \u2013 because it\u2019s about time!\u201d</p> <p>Hasbro has taken stabs at girl-centric games before. It first released the cringe Girl Talk in 1988. The game was a quiet, moderate success and special Hannah Montana and One Direction editions were released in the 00s. Girl Talk felt like a company\u2019s idea of what young girls liked. Inspired by Truth or Dare, the game focused exclusively on boys, sleepovers, and talking on the phone. Unlucky players were forced to wear \u201czit-stickers\u201d.</p> <p>Ms Monopoly is part of a larger trend in the children\u2019s toy and board game industry.

The war game<em> sought</em> to shine light on colonization, as players acted as European powers fighting for control of Africa. But that\u2019s not how the public saw it.

      "bodyText": "Can a board game help fix gender equality? Hasbro hopes so. The company announced the release of Ms Monopoly last week, \u201cthe first-ever game where women make more than men\u201d. The game attempts to flip gender inequality on its head: female players collect $240 when they pass go, while men collect only $200. It\u2019s a concept that feels like deliberate catnip for online outrage. \u201cAt Hasbro, we have always believed in promoting equality and inclusion across our business and our product,\u201d said Kristina Timmins, a spokeswoman for the company. \u201cThat\u2019s why we decided to give the franchise a new mascot: Ms Monopoly, an advocate whose mission is to invest in female entrepreneurs. We want to recognize and celebrate the many contributions women have made to our society and continue to make on a daily basis \u2013 because it\u2019s about time!\u201d Hasbro has taken stabs at girl-centric games before. It first released the cringe Girl Talk in 1988. The game was a quiet, moderate success and special Hannah Montana and One Direction editions were released in the 00s. Girl Talk felt like a company\u2019s idea of what young girls liked. Inspired by Truth or Dare, the game focused exclusively on boys, sleepovers, and talking on the phone. Unlucky players were forced to wear \u201czit-stickers\u201d. Ms Monopoly is part of a larger trend in the children\u2019s toy and board game industry. One where companies are trying their hardest to make playtime more woke. A new \u201cquarter-life crisis\u201d version of The Game of Life (which promoted the American Dream for decades with its neat path of job, marriage, kids, retirement) now sees players work to pay off $500,000 worth of student debt. When GMT games, a mid-sized publisher that specializes in strategy games, announced its new game, Scramble for Africa, earlier this year the response was outrage. The war game sought to shine light on colonization, as players acted as European powers fighting for control of Africa. But that\u2019s not how the public saw it. The game\u2019s release was quickly cancelled (both in the literal and figurative sense). Even Barbie has read some critical theory and undergone a \u201cwokeover\u201d. Mattel recently released a Rosa Parks Barbie (as part of its Inspiring Women series) and a D\u00eda de los Muertos version to commemorate the Mexican holiday. They join a growing list of inclusive Barbies and Kens. There\u2019s now a Barbie that uses a wheelchair, a black Barbie with a natural hairstyle, and a Ken with a slightly higher BMI. Public response to these inclusive products have been mixed. Some critics and commentators call them inclusive and empowering. Others call them \u201cwoke-washing.\u201d \u201cIf Hasbro is serious about women\u2019s empowerment, perhaps the company could start by admitting that a woman invented Monopoly in the first place,\u201d Mary Pilon, author of The Monopolists, wrote in the New Yorker. \u201cThere\u2019s already this vibe in the [board] gaming community that anything Monopoly does is a cash-grab,\u201d says John \u201cHex\u201d Carter, a board game designer and consultant. \u201cBecause the market is already flooded with so many different versions of it.

      "body": "<p>It started with the tents. From 2010 onwards it seemed they were springing up everywhere\u2013 in stations, shopping centres, tunnels, parks, wastelands. Blots on every landscape. Tents became a symbol of David Cameron and George Osborne\u2019s austerity politics \u2013 or the Big Society, where statutory public services and benefits were slashed and replaced by the voluntary sector and well-meaning individuals with sandwich trolleys. In the blink of an eye, tents became normalised. Britain became a society in which those with nothing, and sometimes even those who worked for a wage, were housed in plastic.</p> <p>Then we discovered that people weren\u2019t simply living in tents, they were dying in them too. Aimee Teese in Liverpool overdosed in her tent while Richard Kehoe was found dead in his after he stopped taking his diabetes medication \u2013 both in Liverpool. It\u2019s a truism that society\u2019s most vulnerable have been hardest hit by austerity politics. And you don\u2019t get more vulnerable than the homeless. And of the homeless, you don\u2019t get more vulnerable than the street homeless. And the most vulnerable of them all? They don\u2019t get to live. They perish on the streets of Britain, or in hostels if they\u2019re lucky.</p> <p>Last year it felt as if Britain had finally started to take notice of those dying homeless in Britain. The <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2018-04-23/dying-homeless\">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a> undertook an important project to count and bear witness to Britain\u2019s homeless dead, and soon after the Office of National Statistics started to collate figures \u2013 how they died, age, why, where, when. Shocking new data emerged. Last year Shelter estimated that 320,000 people were homeless in Britain \u2013 from sofa surfers to those in temporary accommodation and hostels, and ultimately those sleeping rough on the streets. The government\u2019s own statistics, published in January 2018, show that street homelessness had increased by 169% since 2010. The average age of those dying on Britain\u2019s streets is 42 for women and 44 for men. It is estimated that 800 homeless people died in the 18 months before March 2019, but the figures may be far higher.</p> <p>Horrific statistics. But in the end they are little more than that \u2013 statistics. What we want to do is tell the stories of some of these people. Not so much the story of their death, but the story of their life \u2013 what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We also wanted to find out what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently by statutory agencies or the voluntary sector to prevent their deaths.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/17/homeless-deaths-share-your-tributes\">Homeless deaths: share your tributes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All the people we are writing about had their demons. Many were victims of abuse; some were self-destructive or suffering from mental illness; all were addicted to drink or drugs. At the same time, in virtually every case we discovered a failing of those who are there to protect them that could have been the difference between them living or dying.</p> <p>Over the next few months we will be recounting the lives of homeless people who have recently died in the UK. These stories will focus on a variety of issues, including addiction (the biggest killer of homeless people), suicide (the second biggest killer), care (a hugely disproportionate number of homeless people have been in the care system), , post-traumatic stress disorder, domestic abuse, disability, prison. The individual stories we tell will be a tribute to those who have died on the streets \u2013 an attempt to reclaim their lives \u2013 but also a way in to discussing fundamental issues around homelessness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cab713ede837fde997fab7aae62ee3dd69be7eab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cab713ede837fde997fab7aae62ee3dd69be7eab/0_106_5229_3138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Over the next few months we will publish a series of stories focusing on a variety of issues around homelessness.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Over the next few months we will publish a series of stories focusing on a variety of issues around homelessness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Images Group/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We met politicians, mayors, outreach workers, charity executives who all talked about people falling through the network and a lack of joined-up thinking. At times these phrases felt abstract, divorced from reality. We wanted to discover what they actually meant in real terms; how did the lack of joined-up thinking contribute to the deaths of the people whose stories we were telling?</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s never quite as simple as that. And there are no definitive answers. But in most cases with more resources, compassion, efficiency, time, flexibility and luck these people could still be alive. Some of the failings happened early in life \u2013 for example, the boy from care who was moved numerous times before he was four years old, and then moved yet again when he was finally settled. But many of the failings happened in the final days or day of their lives. We heard the stories of the east European who was turned away from a hostel a week before his death because he did not qualify for benefits and was thought to have no reasonable prospects of a job; the young mother released from prison without accommodation to go to or her addiction treated; the woman who, three days before her death, finally admitted she needed help but was told to come back three weeks later for a rehab place; the young man who, ill and delirious, told the ambulance service he didn\u2019t want to go to hospital and died later that day. None of this was malicious or deliberate. They are just examples of services stretched beyond breaking point, bogged down in bureaucracy, or not acting as wisely as they could.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/17/the-homeless-death-of-aimee-teese-i-didnt-think-it-would-come-to-this-at-30\">The homeless death of Aimee Teese: 'I didn't think it would come to this at 30'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many issues arise from what we heard and saw: the lack of accountability of those housing vulnerable people in semi-independent accommodation; the coroners who let statutory and voluntary services off the hook by concluding the deceased had all the support they needed without really scrutinising the situation; the lack of formal reviews into those who have died homeless. As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and the organisations charged with helping the homeless to respond to the issues raised. We are also asking readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all. It is time to stop just passing by.</p> <p>But this series is about much more than pinpointing institutional and governmental failures. Ultimately it is a tribute to those who lived and died homeless, and the families and friends who did their best to keep them alive. It has been tough for people like Cathy Teese, who today tells the story of her niece Aimee, to open up to us. But they have done so for one reason only \u2013 by telling the story of their loved ones, they hope to make it less likely that others will suffer such a terrible fate.</p> <p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

Not so much the story of their death, but the story of their life \u2013 what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We also wanted to find out what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently by statutory agencies or the voluntary sector to prevent their deaths. All the people we are writing about had their demons. Many were victims of abuse; some were self-destructive or suffering from mental illness; all were addicted to drink or drugs. At the same time, in virtually every case we discovered a failing of those who are there to protect them that could have been the difference between them living or dying. Over the next few months we will be recounting the lives of homeless people who have recently died in the UK. These stories will focus on a variety of issues, including addiction (the biggest killer of homeless people), suicide (the second biggest killer), care (a hugely disproportionate number of homeless people have been in the care system), , post-traumatic stress disorder, domestic abuse, disability, prison. The individual stories we tell will be a tribute to those who have died on the streets \u2013 an attempt to reclaim their lives \u2013 but also a way in to discussing fundamental issues around homelessness. We met politicians, mayors, outreach workers, charity executives who all talked about people falling through the network and a lack of joined-up thinking. At times these phrases felt abstract, divorced from reality. We wanted to discover what they actually meant in real terms; how did the lack of joined-up thinking contribute to the deaths of the people whose stories we were telling? Of course, it\u2019s never quite as simple as that. And there are no definitive answers. But in most cases with more resources, compassion, efficiency, time, flexibility and luck these people could still be alive. Some of the failings happened early in life \u2013 for example, the boy from care who was moved numerous times before he was four years old, and then moved yet again when he was finally settled. But many of the failings happened in the final days or day of their lives. We heard the stories of the east European who was turned away from a hostel a week before his death because he did not qualify for benefits and was thought to have no reasonable prospects of a job; the young mother released from prison without accommodation to go to or her addiction treated; the woman who, three days before her death, finally admitted she needed help but was told to come back three weeks later for a rehab place; the young man who, ill and delirious, told the ambulance service he didn\u2019t want to go to hospital and died later that day. None of this was malicious or deliberate. They are just examples of services stretched beyond breaking point, bogged down in bureaucracy, or not acting as wisely as they could. Many issues arise from what we heard and saw: the lack of accountability of those housing vulnerable people in semi-independent accommodation; the coroners who let statutory and voluntary services off the hook by concluding the deceased had all the support they needed without really scrutinising the situation; the lack of formal reviews into those who have died homeless. As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and the organisations charged with helping the homeless to respond to the issues raised. We are also asking readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all. It is time to stop just passing by. But this series is about much more than pinpointing institutional and governmental failures. Ultimately it is a tribute to those who lived and died homeless, and the families and friends who did their best to keep them alive. It has been tough for people like Cathy Teese, who today tells the story of her niece Aimee, to open up to us. But they have done so for one reason only \u2013 by telling the story of their loved ones, they hope to make it less likely that others will suffer such a terrible fate.

In 2009, after the election of Barack Obama, the EPA started working on greenhouse gas standards for vehicles for the first time. It felt like we were making history.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a team of around 25 people producing thousands of pages of analysis for the standards. We knew it would be controversial but it was a very big deal, the first critical steps to address the climate crisis.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-5-zip/giv-3902d8jdxgN0Ltya/index.html\" data-alt=\"climate series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-5-zip/giv-3902d8jdxgN0Ltya/index.html\">climate series linker</a> </figure>  <p><strong>What changed under the Trump administration?</strong></p> <p>\u201cOnce Trump was elected it became pretty clear that things would change. The president came out to Michigan in March 2017 and gave a speech where he said he\u2019d look at the standards, that they hurt economic activity and jobs. That was an obvious sign, really.</p> <p>\u201cIn August 2018 the administration proposed an eight-year freeze of the greenhouse gas standards. It was unbelievable, really \u2013 for the first time in the history of the EPA the political leadership decided to change pollution standards that were doing well without allowing the career staff and experts to play any sort of role. We were completely locked out.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no scientific or technical rationale to rolling back the standards, the analysis they used was the most biased thing I\u2019ve ever seen. They cooked the books and changed every assumption they could to get the answer they wanted. It was so bad that some EPA career staff asked their bosses to take the EPA name off it all.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about your experience?</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt broke my heart. I\u2019d had this wonderful career, playing a small role in making the world a better place. Then we had a political leadership making decisions on ideology, denying science, basically being climate deniers. It felt horrible.</p> <p>\u201cI was 62 years old and there were a few family things going on, but the Trump administration made a difficult decision to retire much easier. I felt I could do more good on the outside, educating the public on what\u2019s going on. By the time I left, the morale was the lowest I\u2019d seen in 40 years. Our work had become irrelevant.\u201d</p> <h2>Response from the EPA</h2> <p>Asked by the Guardian on Monday about the concerns outlined by four former EPA scientists, the EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in a statement: \u201cThe EPA under President Trump has strived to create an agency that is responsive to the American people.\u201d</p> <p>The statement said this included \u201cproposing the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/safer-affordable-fuel-efficient-safe-vehicles-proposed\">Safe (Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient)</a> rule that will save lives and produce savings for American consumers, working on the first major update to the lead and copper rule in nearly three decades\u201d.</p> <p>It added the agency was also \u201con track to become the first administration to complete an <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/naaqs\">ozone NAAQS</a> <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/naaqs\">(National Ambient Air Quality Standards)</a> in the five-year review cycle envisioned by Congress\u201d, and had deleted 22 sites from the national priorities list of those eligible for Superfund cleanup, the most since the financial year 2005.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Maria Caffrey\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;style&gt; @font-face { font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; src: url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.woff2') format('woff2'), url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.woff') format('woff'), url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.ttf') format('truetype'); font-weight: bold; // 700 font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.svg#GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  div { max-height: 600px; position: relative; font-size: 17px; font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;,Georgia,serif; line-height: 24px; }  .text-container { display: flex; flex-direction: row-reverse; border-top: 1px solid #88040f; border-bottom: 1px solid #88040f; } h2 { font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; font-size: 44px; left: 6px; line-height: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 16px; } img { max-width: 50%; top: 0; right: 0; }  span { font-weight: 700; }  @media screen and (max-width: 450px) { img { max-width: 100%; }  h2 { font-size: 38px; left: 10px; } .text-container { flex-direction: column-reverse; } } &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;text-container&quot;&gt; &lt;img  src=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-2-zip/giv-39020ubR0Q16SJPV/maria_caffrey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Maria Caffrey&quot;/&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maria Caffrey&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;span&gt;Role:&lt;/span&gt; Worked on climate change at the National Park Service (NPS) &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>What did the work involve?</strong></p> <p>\u201cI was studying how climate change will affect 118 coastal parks in the US for the National Park Service. I started this work in July 2013, it was my baby.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What changed under the Trump administration?</strong></p> <p>\u201cMy study went through peer review and was ready to be released but I was told by the NPS a few days after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration that they were \u2018waiting for messaging\u2019 first. I thought that was no big deal but then nothing happened and I started calling up every few weeks to say, \u2018We\u2019ve got to get this out, it\u2019s getting stale.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThe excuses varied but became ever more vague, such as \u2018we are ever so busy\u2019 or that it would worry people during hurricane season because it mentions storm surge in coastal areas. A superior said they wanted to keep a low profile on climate change for four or maybe eight years while Trump was around, which really upset me because we don\u2019t have four to eight years to do nothing. I felt I was being silenced.</p> <p>\u201cI went on maternity leave around Christmas 2017 and the report still hadn\u2019t been released. I got an email from a colleague saying, \u2018Congrats on the baby, by the way you should know they are editing your report.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWe had a conference call and it became clear that any mention of human-caused climate change had been taken out. I was asked how I would feel if they didn\u2019t release the report at all, which felt like a threat. I stood my ground and was told \u2018they aren\u2019t going to be happy about this from above.\u2019 It was never clear who \u2018they\u2019 were \u2013 perhaps Trump himself or Ryan Zinke [the then secretary of the interior].</p> <p>\u201cI then had a meeting with a senior NPS official who came out from Washington DC. The other report co-authors were there, too. That\u2019s when it all unravelled, it became incredibly hostile. I was told not to attribute changes in public lands to human actions.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like we worked for the American people and I didn\u2019t want to lie to them. But a superior said that we in fact work for the executive branch of which the president is the head. The president is the boss and we are going to put our heads down and put out the line of the administration.</p> <p>\u201cA journalist did a freedom of information request and saw all the emails of us fighting over this and asked me for a statement. I ended up going on the record because I thought it was a very important issue. I was aghast I was being asked to lie. These people were violating the mission of the NPS.</p> <p>\u201cAfter I came back from maternity leave I was demoted to be an intern on $25,000 a year. And then in February this year they said there was no money left at all and that I would have to leave. It was devastating. I offered to work for free as a volunteer but was turned down, which shows that it wasn\u2019t a money issue really. I packed up my office and I was gone. I filed a whistleblower complaint in July.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about your experience?</strong></p> <p>\u201cI have faced retribution, I was threatened and placed in a hostile work environment. It\u2019s clear in some agencies there\u2019s a culture of fear where scientists are being intimidated. When I wrote this report, politics was the last thing on my mind, I was thinking about climate change and these coastal parks.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating, it\u2019s not where I pictured where my career would be at this time in my life. I don\u2019t even know if I have a career any more. What\u2019s left is in tatters.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Response from the National Park Service</strong></p> <p>A statement from the NPS said it was \u201cconfident in the quality and accuracy of the science behind the sea level rise and storm surge projections presented in the report\u201d and staff involved showed \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cThe report underwent several rounds of internal and external scientific peer review to ensure that it is most helpful and relevant to the intended audience of park managers and planners\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The NPS said understanding how climate change \u201caffects park resources and infrastructure is part of our core responsibility to protect parks\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Chris Frey\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;style&gt; @font-face { font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; src: url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.woff2') format('woff2'), url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.woff') format('woff'), url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.ttf') format('truetype'); font-weight: bold; // 700 font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.svg#GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  div { max-height: 600px; position: relative; font-size: 17px; font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;,Georgia,serif; line-height: 24px; }  .text-container { display: flex; flex-direction: row-reverse; border-top: 1px solid #88040f; border-bottom: 1px solid #88040f; } h2 { font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; font-size: 44px; left: 6px; line-height: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 16px; } img { max-width: 50%; top: 0; right: 0; }  span { font-weight: 700; }  @media screen and (max-width: 450px) { img { max-width: 100%; }  h2 { font-size: 38px; left: 10px; } .text-container { flex-direction: column-reverse; } } &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;text-container&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-3902SdzT3O1iBZOI/chris_frey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chris Frey&quot;/&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chris Frey&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;span&gt;Role:&lt;/span&gt; A professor of environmental engineering at North Carolina State University, Frey was chairman of the EPA\u2019s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and a member of the agency\u2019s Science Advisory Board. He left in 2018 &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>What did the work involve?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe Clean Air Science Advisory Committee (Casac) is required to inform the EPA administrator over air quality standards, if they are sufficient to protect public health or not [under the Clean Air Act]. The EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board is a much larger committee that takes on all sorts of things \u2013 clean water rules, vehicle greenhouse gas standards, rules about transparency and so on.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What changed under the Trump administration?</strong></p> <p>\u201cInitially there was a neglectful relationship with the new Trump administration; they seemed uninterested and the amount of scientific advisory board work dropped off. Then, from October 2018, there were the first signs of the ideological assault on scientific advice at the EPA.</p> <p>\u201cScott Pruitt [then administrator of the EPA] wrote a memo that said that researchers that have received grants from the EPA aren\u2019t allowed to serve on panels because of a perceived conflict of interest. But there was no prohibition on industry people serving and the number of them on the panels has increased. It\u2019s been a way to kick qualified people off the boards and get cronies in their place.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a complete turnover of Casac and it shows in meetings. They now bumble through things because they don\u2019t understand the process and the Clean Air Act. Political appointees are interfering with the selection of candidates, essentially picking those sympathetic to the agenda of the administration, even if they have fringe views like climate change isn\u2019t happening, that kind of stuff.</p> <p>\u201cI was on a panel looking at the risks posed by particulate matter. We had a lot more work to do but we were disbanded four days before the EPA released an assessment that we would\u2019ve reviewed. The timing was mind-boggling. I found out by seeing a press release on the EPA website, which was followed by an email saying our services were no longer needed.</p> <p>\u201cI was also a nominee for a panel on ozone but then they said they wouldn\u2019t go ahead with that. It was a little frustrating for me personally, but it\u2019s more of a loss to the American public. The EPA has always been thought of as a science-based agency; what we see now is no basic respect for science.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about your experience?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not even lip service to the science. Science can\u2019t be controlled like ideological spin, so the administration is afraid of that. They don\u2019t want scientists and their evidence-based opinions \u2013 they\u2019d rather have cronies trot out the same tired talking points on fringe scientific views.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Joel Clement\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;style&gt; @font-face { font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; src: url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.woff2') format('woff2'), url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.woff') format('woff'), url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.ttf') format('truetype'); font-weight: bold; // 700 font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.svg#GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  div { max-height: 600px; position: relative; font-size: 17px; font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;,Georgia,serif; line-height: 24px; }  .text-container { display: flex; flex-direction: row-reverse; border-top: 1px solid #88040f; border-bottom: 1px solid #88040f; } h2 { font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; font-size: 44px; left: 6px; line-height: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 16px; } img { max-width: 50%; top: 0; right: 0; }  span { font-weight: 700; }  @media screen and (max-width: 450px) { img { max-width: 100%; }  h2 { font-size: 38px; left: 10px; } .text-container { flex-direction: column-reverse; } } &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;text-container&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-3902SdzT3O1iBZOI/joel_clemon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Joel Clement&quot;/&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Joel Clement&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;span&gt;Role:&lt;/span&gt; An expert on the impact of climate change on the Arctic at the Department of the Interior &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>What did the work involve?</strong></p> <p>\u201cI was at [the department of the] interior for nearly seven years. I started on 3 January 2011 \u2013 I know the exact date because of how excited and inspired I was at the thought of serving in the federal government. I was hired as a senior executive to run the office of policy analysis, which sits in the office of the secretary.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the main areas of focus was addressing the impacts of climate change in the Arctic, which is warming two to three times faster than the rest of the planet. Entire Alaska native villages are threatened by rapid coastal erosion and storms because they no longer have a sea ice curtain to protect them from fierce Arctic storms in the fall and early winter, and the ground beneath their feet is falling away as the permafrost thaws.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What changed under the Trump administration?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe new Trump team was very thin and most of them knew very little about the agency mission \u2013 they were mostly oil and gas lobbyists and some campaign workers. Whatever they were talking about up on the secretary\u2019s hallway, it sure wasn\u2019t being shared with the career staff at the agency. So you basically had 70,000 employees scratching their heads and getting back to doing their jobs while a couple dozen political appointees tried to get their act together to lead them. It was surreal.</p> <p>\u201cBut this neglect soon turned into scorn, characterized by comments from the new secretary, Ryan Zinke, <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/570c910d21be41869f76d45a2c55c359\">that the staff were disloyal</a>. Morale began to quickly plummet as the political ranks showed not only ignorance of, but disdain for the wide-ranging agency mission. Here you had tens of thousands of people working hard in public service and being told what they do is not important.</p> <p>\u201cThe National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service had it worst because they didn\u2019t have anything to do with oil and gas or mining permitting process, and the lobbyists in charge had no interest in wildlife, conservation or biodiversity.</p> <p>\u201cBut every agency suffered, because the mantra of the administration was to drain the swamp \u2013 and it quickly became clear that the swamp was not the high-paid lobbyists, but the rank-and-file government professionals who serve the country.</p> <p>\u201cOn a Thursday night in June, just a week after I\u2019d been in New York to speak at the United Nations about climate change adaptation issues, I received an email that said I was being moved to a new position.</p> <p>\u201cIt was quickly obvious that this was a retaliatory action, as I was moved away from any climate change work to the office that collects royalty income from oil, gas and mining companies \u2013 an auditing position for which I had zero expertise. The email explained that because I had economists on my policy staff that I must clearly know about numbers, so I\u2019d be good in an auditing office.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d heard that they were looking for a job that I would not want, in hopes that I would quit. It\u2019s not unusual for senior executives to be reassigned, it\u2019s part of the job, but reassignment can\u2019t be used to get people to quit \u2013 and Secretary Zinke <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/interior-chief-wants-to-shed-4000-employees-in-department-shake-up/2017/06/21/791cadd0-56a7-11e7-a204-ad706461fa4f_story.html\">testified to Congress</a> a week later that he was using reassignments, among other methods, to trim the workforce. Sadly, I was only one of dozens of executives who were reassigned that night, many of us for clearly retaliatory reasons.</p> <p>\u201cI found legal counsel and eventually filed a whistleblower complaint and went public with an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/im-a-scientist-the-trump-administration-reassigned-me-for-speaking-up-about-climate-change/2017/07/19/389b8dce-6b12-11e7-9c15-177740635e83_story.html\">op-</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/im-a-scientist-the-trump-administration-reassigned-me-for-speaking-up-about-climate-change/2017/07/19/389b8dce-6b12-11e7-9c15-177740635e83_story.html\">ed in the Washington Post</a>. I wasn\u2019t worried too much about my job at that point, I was worried about the work I\u2019d been doing on behalf of Alaska Natives, and it was clear they had no intention of continuing to work to help those frontline communities.</p> <p>\u201cA couple months later I decided that they\u2019d already taken my job, but there was no way I\u2019d let them take my voice, so I resigned and continued to speak publicly about these abuses and the implications for American health and safety.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about your experience?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe Trump administration is threatened by evidence, by science and by expertise. These things interfere with their ability to hobble government agencies and reduce oversight. It\u2019s mind-boggling and a profound threat to democracy but it also increases risks to American health and safety.

It went viral and since then I spend 20 to 30 hours a week helping the press and Congress understand the impact of what the Trump administration is doing.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this complete abandonment of science, solely to maximize corporate profits. Everything changed after the election. The climate change section of the EPA website came down and Scott Pruitt came in and brought in a bunch of political appointees who didn\u2019t need Senate confirmation.</p> <p>\u201cI was working on a chemical safety rule that was rewritten by Nancy Beck, someone from the American Chemistry Council [an industry lobby group] who Pruitt brought in. It basically repeated the talking points she used on the chemistry council.</p> <p>\u201cPruitt never spoke to any of the career staff before he made decisions on replacing rules. I worked on a rule that would require coal-fired power plants to treat toxic waste rather than simply dump it into leaky ponds. Pruitt met with Bob Murray [head of the coalmining firm Murray Energy Corporation] and decided to postpone the rule and the first we knew about it was when we were asked to check a draft press release about the rollback.</p> <p>\u201cScientists are really irrelevant at the EPA now, their input isn\u2019t requested. They are simply directed by the political team to help fulfill the desires of political donors, no matter the cost to Americans. At the moment it\u2019s just a logistical question of how fast they can go on this. They have something like 70 regulation repeals under way and because it will be hard to do this with legal challenges they want to undermine the underlying science.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What happened after you left?</strong></p> <p>\u201cWithin a couple of days of me leaving an opposition research firm did a freedom of information request for all my emails and the EPA immediately handed them over. I found out they made a big effort to connect with all the rightwing media to trash me. They made up this lie that I was being paid more than a Congress member for every year of my retirement. It got really ugly, so I got off social media.</p> <p>\u201cThe same opposition group then tried to find out if any EPA employees donated to [Bernie] Sanders or [Elizabeth] Warren. It\u2019s stunning to target federal employees like that. I\u2019ve never seen that before.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Jacob Carter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;style&gt; @font-face { font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; src: url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.woff2') format('woff2'), url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.woff') format('woff'), url('https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GHGuardianHeadline/GHGuardianHeadline-Bold.ttf') format('truetype'); font-weight: bold; // 700 font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.svg#GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  div { max-height: 600px; position: relative; font-size: 17px; font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;,Georgia,serif; line-height: 24px; }  .text-container { display: flex; flex-direction: row-reverse; border-top: 1px solid #88040f; border-bottom: 1px solid #88040f; } h2 { font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; font-size: 44px; left: 6px; line-height: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 16px; } img { max-width: 50%; top: 0; right: 0; }  span { font-weight: 700; }  @media screen and (max-width: 450px) { img { max-width: 100%; }  h2 { font-size: 38px; left: 10px; } .text-container { flex-direction: column-reverse; } } &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;text-container&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-3902SdzT3O1iBZOI/jacob_carter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jacob Carter&quot;/&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jacob Carter&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;span&gt;Role:&lt;/span&gt; Worked on climate change impacts upon Superfund sites (toxic areas requiring federal cleanup) at the EPA &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>What did the work involve?</strong></p> <p>\u201cI was brought in by the EPA to do climate change work for the office that oversees the Superfund site program, which are toxic areas that require a federal cleanup.</p> <p>\u201cI was specifically working on the Superfund site program because President Obama had issued an executive order for any federal agencies that would put forward new federal dollars into infrastructure. Essentially, he wanted those agencies to incorporate climate change into flood risk for that infrastructure.</p> <p>\u201cThe model essentially looks at how much sea level rise is expected over the next 100 years. Plus what did the extreme floods look like in those areas? And I combine those two sets of data to create a model that is predictive of these future extreme floods that we\u2019re seeing more of currently and are expected to see more of in the future.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What changed under the Trump administration?</strong></p> <p>\u201cI knew from President Trump, then candidate Trump\u2019s campaign, how he felt about climate change, that I was likely on the chopping block because I was a postdoctoral fellow and my contract was sort of on a year-to-year basis.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so after the transition occurred, I was there for a couple of weeks and then one day my boss came to my office and said: \u2018I think you should probably start looking for another position.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about your experience?</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt was a very difficult time for me, absolutely. I was extremely sad and depressed. I really liked the work that I was doing. I felt like I was doing research that was really going to have a significant impact.</p> <p>\u201cI had worked really hard on it. To see something like that just get sort of tossed out the window was really disheartening to see. And the fact that they were just going to completely dismiss this climate change work altogether was also really disheartening. So, yeah. It was a very sad time for me. I will not lie.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of different scenarios that have occurred that show that this administration really does not care about progressing climate change or climate science, in general.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, any time you see some sort of report come out of the agency that even mildly mentions climate change and maybe its impacts to national parks, or something to that extent, the administration tries to downplay human connection to climate change. They try to downplay the role of climate change and federal scientists\u2019 work in press releases.</p> <p>\u201cThey try to downplay the role of climate change and research that they\u2019re funding. So even in grants that the agencies are receiving, they\u2019re now being vetted by political officials to essentially make sure that climate change is not mentioned in those proposals. It\u2019s not a great time to be a climate change scientist in the federal government.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on Tuesday September 24 2019 to add a statement from the National Park Service.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by J Oliver Conroy</em></p> <p><em>Illustrations by M\u00e1ximo Tuja</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "From weakening vehicle emissions to blocking warnings about how coastal parks could flood or the impact on the Arctic, the Trump administration is accused of muzzling climate science. Here six whistleblowers and former government scientists describe being sidelined by the administration \u2013 and why they won\u2019t be quiet. What did the work involve? \u201cI was an engineer at the EPA, working for 40 years in a very technical job. In 2009, after the election of Barack Obama, the EPA started working on greenhouse gas standards for vehicles for the first time. It felt like we were making history. \u201cThere was a team of around 25 people producing thousands of pages of analysis for the standards. We knew it would be controversial but it was a very big deal, the first critical steps to address the climate crisis.\u201d What changed under the Trump administration? \u201cOnce Trump was elected it became pretty clear that things would change. The president came out to Michigan in March 2017 and gave a speech where he said he\u2019d look at the standards, that they hurt economic activity and jobs. That was an obvious sign, really. \u201cIn August 2018 the administration proposed an eight-year freeze of the greenhouse gas standards. It was unbelievable, really \u2013 for the first time in the history of the EPA the political leadership decided to change pollution standards that were doing well without allowing the career staff and experts to play any sort of role. We were completely locked out. \u201cThere was no scientific or technical rationale to rolling back the standards, the analysis they used was the most biased thing I\u2019ve ever seen. They cooked the books and changed every assumption they could to get the answer they wanted. It was so bad that some EPA career staff asked their bosses to take the EPA name off it all.\u201d How do you feel about your experience? \u201cIt broke my heart. I\u2019d had this wonderful career, playing a small role in making the world a better place. Then we had a political leadership making decisions on ideology, denying science, basically being climate deniers. It felt horrible. \u201cI was 62 years old and there were a few family things going on, but the Trump administration made a difficult decision to retire much easier. I felt I could do more good on the outside, educating the public on what\u2019s going on. By the time I left, the morale was the lowest I\u2019d seen in 40 years. Our work had become irrelevant.\u201d Response from the EPA Asked by the Guardian on Monday about the concerns outlined by four former EPA scientists, the EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in a statement: \u201cThe EPA under President Trump has strived to create an agency that is responsive to the American people.\u201d The statement said this included \u201cproposing the Safe (Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient) rule that will save lives and produce savings for American consumers, working on the first major update to the lead and copper rule in nearly three decades\u201d. It added the agency was also \u201con track to become the first administration to complete an ozone NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) in the five-year review cycle envisioned by Congress\u201d, and had deleted 22 sites from the national priorities list of those eligible for Superfund cleanup, the most since the financial year 2005. What did the work involve? \u201cI was studying how climate change will affect 118 coastal parks in the US for the National Park Service. I started this work in July 2013, it was my baby.\u201d What changed under the Trump administration? \u201cMy study went through peer review and was ready to be released but I was told by the NPS a few days after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration that they were \u2018waiting for messaging\u2019 first. I thought that was no big deal but then nothing happened and I started calling up every few weeks to say, \u2018We\u2019ve got to get this out, it\u2019s getting stale.\u2019 \u201cThe excuses varied but became ever more vague, such as \u2018we are ever so busy\u2019 or that it would worry people during hurricane season because it mentions storm surge in coastal areas. A superior said they wanted to keep a low profile on climate change for four or maybe eight years while Trump was around, which really upset me because we don\u2019t have four to eight years to do nothing. I felt I was being silenced. \u201cI went on maternity leave around Christmas 2017 and the report still hadn\u2019t been released. I got an email from a colleague saying, \u2018Congrats on the baby, by the way you should know they are editing your report.\u2019 \u201cWe had a conference call and it became clear that any mention of human-caused climate change had been taken out. I was asked how I would feel if they didn\u2019t release the report at all, which felt like a threat. I stood my ground and was told \u2018they aren\u2019t going to be happy about this from above.\u2019 It was never clear who \u2018they\u2019 were \u2013 perhaps Trump himself or Ryan Zinke [the then secretary of the interior]. \u201cI then had a meeting with a senior NPS official who came out from Washington DC. The other report co-authors were there, too. That\u2019s when it all unravelled, it became incredibly hostile. I was told not to attribute changes in public lands to human actions. \u201cI felt like we worked for the American people and I didn\u2019t want to lie to them. But a superior said that we in fact work for the executive branch of which the president is the head. The president is the boss and we are going to put our heads down and put out the line of the administration. \u201cA journalist did a freedom of information request and saw all the emails of us fighting over this and asked me for a statement. I ended up going on the record because I thought it was a very important issue. I was aghast I was being asked to lie. These people were violating the mission of the NPS. \u201cAfter I came back from maternity leave I was demoted to be an intern on $25,000 a year. And then in February this year they said there was no money left at all and that I would have to leave. It was devastating. I offered to work for free as a volunteer but was turned down, which shows that it wasn\u2019t a money issue really. I packed up my office and I was gone. I filed a whistleblower complaint in July.\u201d How do you feel about your experience? \u201cI have faced retribution, I was threatened and placed in a hostile work environment. It\u2019s clear in some agencies there\u2019s a culture of fear where scientists are being intimidated. When I wrote this report, politics was the last thing on my mind, I was thinking about climate change and these coastal parks. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating, it\u2019s not where I pictured where my career would be at this time in my life. I don\u2019t even know if I have a career any more. What\u2019s left is in tatters.\u201d Response from the National Park Service A statement from the NPS said it was \u201cconfident in the quality and accuracy of the science behind the sea level rise and storm surge projections presented in the report\u201d and staff involved showed \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d. It added: \u201cThe report underwent several rounds of internal and external scientific peer review to ensure that it is most helpful and relevant to the intended audience of park managers and planners\u2026\u201d The NPS said understanding how climate change \u201caffects park resources and infrastructure is part of our core responsibility to protect parks\u201d. What did the work involve? \u201cThe Clean Air Science Advisory Committee (Casac) is required to inform the EPA administrator over air quality standards, if they are sufficient to protect public health or not [under the Clean Air Act]. The EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board is a much larger committee that takes on all sorts of things \u2013 clean water rules, vehicle greenhouse gas standards, rules about transparency and so on.\u201d What changed under the Trump administration? \u201cInitially there was a neglectful relationship with the new Trump administration; they seemed uninterested and the amount of scientific advisory board work dropped off. Then, from October 2018, there were the first signs of the ideological assault on scientific advice at the EPA. \u201cScott Pruitt [then administrator of the EPA] wrote a memo that said that researchers that have received grants from the EPA aren\u2019t allowed to serve on panels because of a perceived conflict of interest. But there was no prohibition on industry people serving and the number of them on the panels has increased. It\u2019s been a way to kick qualified people off the boards and get cronies in their place. \u201cThere was a complete turnover of Casac and it shows in meetings. They now bumble through things because they don\u2019t understand the process and the Clean Air Act. Political appointees are interfering with the selection of candidates, essentially picking those sympathetic to the agenda of the administration, even if they have fringe views like climate change isn\u2019t happening, that kind of stuff. \u201cI was on a panel looking at the risks posed by particulate matter. We had a lot more work to do but we were disbanded four days before the EPA released an assessment that we would\u2019ve reviewed. The timing was mind-boggling. I found out by seeing a press release on the EPA website, which was followed by an email saying our services were no longer needed. \u201cI was also a nominee for a panel on ozone but then they said they wouldn\u2019t go ahead with that. It was a little frustrating for me personally, but it\u2019s more of a loss to the American public. The EPA has always been thought of as a science-based agency; what we see now is no basic respect for science.\u201d How do you feel about your experience? \u201cThere\u2019s not even lip service to the science. Science can\u2019t be controlled like ideological spin, so the administration is afraid of that. They don\u2019t want scientists and their evidence-based opinions \u2013 they\u2019d rather have cronies trot out the same tired talking points on fringe scientific views.\u201d What did the work involve? \u201cI was at [the department of the] interior for nearly seven years. I started on 3 January 2011 \u2013 I know the exact date because of how excited and inspired I was at the thought of serving in the federal government. I was hired as a senior executive to run the office of policy analysis, which sits in the office of the secretary. \u201cOne of the main areas of focus was addressing the impacts of climate change in the Arctic, which is warming two to three times faster than the rest of the planet. Entire Alaska native villages are threatened by rapid coastal erosion and storms because they no longer have a sea ice curtain to protect them from fierce Arctic storms in the fall and early winter, and the ground beneath their feet is falling away as the permafrost thaws.\u201d What changed under the Trump administration? \u201cThe new Trump team was very thin and most of them knew very little about the agency mission \u2013 they were mostly oil and gas lobbyists and some campaign workers. Whatever they were talking about up on the secretary\u2019s hallway, it sure wasn\u2019t being shared with the career staff at the agency. So you basically had 70,000 employees scratching their heads and getting back to doing their jobs while a couple dozen political appointees tried to get their act together to lead them. It was surreal. \u201cBut this neglect soon turned into scorn, characterized by comments from the new secretary, Ryan Zinke, that the staff were disloyal. Morale began to quickly plummet as the political ranks showed not only ignorance of, but disdain for the wide-ranging agency mission. Here you had tens of thousands of people working hard in public service and being told what they do is not important. \u201cThe National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service had it worst because they didn\u2019t have anything to do with oil and gas or mining permitting process, and the lobbyists in charge had no interest in wildlife, conservation or biodiversity. \u201cBut every agency suffered, because the mantra of the administration was to drain the swamp \u2013 and it quickly became clear that the swamp was not the high-paid lobbyists, but the rank-and-file government professionals who serve the country. \u201cOn a Thursday night in June, just a week after I\u2019d been in New York to speak at the United Nations about climate change adaptation issues, I received an email that said I was being moved to a new position. \u201cIt was quickly obvious that this was a retaliatory action, as I was moved away from any climate change work to the office that collects royalty income from oil, gas and mining companies \u2013 an auditing position for which I had zero expertise. The email explained that because I had economists on my policy staff that I must clearly know about numbers, so I\u2019d be good in an auditing office. \u201cI\u2019d heard that they were looking for a job that I would not want, in hopes that I would quit. It\u2019s not unusual for senior executives to be reassigned, it\u2019s part of the job, but reassignment can\u2019t be used to get people to quit \u2013 and Secretary Zinke testified to Congress a week later that he was using reassignments, among other methods, to trim the workforce. Sadly, I was only one of dozens of executives who were reassigned that night, many of us for clearly retaliatory reasons. \u201cI found legal counsel and eventually filed a whistleblower complaint and went public with an op-ed in the Washington Post. I wasn\u2019t worried too much about my job at that point, I was worried about the work I\u2019d been doing on behalf of Alaska Natives, and it was clear they had no intention of continuing to work to help those frontline communities. \u201cA couple months later I decided that they\u2019d already taken my job, but there was no way I\u2019d let them take my voice, so I resigned and continued to speak publicly about these abuses and the implications for American health and safety.\u201d How do you feel about your experience? \u201cThe Trump administration is threatened by evidence, by science and by expertise. These things interfere with their ability to hobble government agencies and reduce oversight. It\u2019s mind-boggling and a profound threat to democracy but it also increases risks to American health and safety. Every American should be concerned, regardless of political stripe.\u201d Response from the interior department A Department of the Interior spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cThe department works to ensure that the scientific activities that it carries out use the best science and are the result of robust and independent processes.\u201d The department said it was required by law to research and publish reports regarding the changing conditions of the climate and has a \u201crich and longstanding culture of scientific integrity that prevails independently of individual administrations\u201d. What did the work involve? \u201cI was at the EPA for 33 years, starting in 1984. I worked in the water program and on Superfund cleanups, working on the criteria for drinkable water.\u201d What changed under the Trump administration? \u201cI left in August 2017 and made a very public retirement statement about how bad this administration is and its assault on science. It went viral and since then I spend 20 to 30 hours a week helping the press and Congress understand the impact of what the Trump administration is doing. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this complete abandonment of science, solely to maximize corporate profits. Everything changed after the election. The climate change section of the EPA website came down and Scott Pruitt came in and brought in a bunch of political appointees who didn\u2019t need Senate confirmation. \u201cI was working on a chemical safety rule that was rewritten by Nancy Beck, someone from the American Chemistry Council [an industry lobby group] who Pruitt brought in. It basically repeated the talking points she used on the chemistry council. \u201cPruitt never spoke to any of the career staff before he made decisions on replacing rules. I worked on a rule that would require coal-fired power plants to treat toxic waste rather than simply dump it into leaky ponds. Pruitt met with Bob Murray [head of the coalmining firm Murray Energy Corporation] and decided to postpone the rule and the first we knew about it was when we were asked to check a draft press release about the rollback. \u201cScientists are really irrelevant at the EPA now, their input isn\u2019t requested. They are simply directed by the political team to help fulfill the desires of political donors, no matter the cost to Americans. At the moment it\u2019s just a logistical question of how fast they can go on this. They have something like 70 regulation repeals under way and because it will be hard to do this with legal challenges they want to undermine the underlying science.\u201d What happened after you left? \u201cWithin a couple of days of me leaving an opposition research firm did a freedom of information request for all my emails and the EPA immediately handed them over. I found out they made a big effort to connect with all the rightwing media to trash me. They made up this lie that I was being paid more than a Congress member for every year of my retirement. It got really ugly, so I got off social media. \u201cThe same opposition group then tried to find out if any EPA employees donated to [Bernie] Sanders or [Elizabeth] Warren. It\u2019s stunning to target federal employees like that. I\u2019ve never seen that before.\u201d What did the work involve? \u201cI was brought in by the EPA to do climate change work for the office that oversees the Superfund site program, which are toxic areas that require a federal cleanup. \u201cI was specifically working on the Superfund site program because President Obama had issued an executive order for any federal agencies that would put forward new federal dollars into infrastructure. Essentially, he wanted those agencies to incorporate climate change into flood risk for that infrastructure. \u201cThe model essentially looks at how much sea level rise is expected over the next 100 years. Plus what did the extreme floods look like in those areas? And I combine those two sets of data to create a model that is predictive of these future extreme floods that we\u2019re seeing more of currently and are expected to see more of in the future.\u201d What changed under the Trump administration? \u201cI knew from President Trump, then candidate Trump\u2019s campaign, how he felt about climate change, that I was likely on the chopping block because I was a postdoctoral fellow and my contract was sort of on a year-to-year basis. \u201cAnd so after the transition occurred, I was there for a couple of weeks and then one day my boss came to my office and said: \u2018I think you should probably start looking for another position.\u2019\u201d How do you feel about your experience? \u201cIt was a very difficult time for me, absolutely. I was extremely sad and depressed. I really liked the work that I was doing. I felt like I was doing research that was really going to have a significant impact. \u201cI had worked really hard on it. To see something like that just get sort of tossed out the window was really disheartening to see. And the fact that they were just going to completely dismiss this climate change work altogether was also really disheartening. So, yeah. It was a very sad time for me. I will not lie. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of different scenarios that have occurred that show that this administration really does not care about progressing climate change or climate science, in general. \u201cI mean, any time you see some sort of report come out of the agency that even mildly mentions climate change and maybe its impacts to national parks, or something to that extent, the administration tries to downplay human connection to climate change. They try to downplay the role of climate change and federal scientists\u2019 work in press releases. \u201cThey try to downplay the role of climate change and research that they\u2019re funding. So even in grants that the agencies are receiving, they\u2019re now being vetted by political officials to essentially make sure that climate change is not mentioned in those proposals. It\u2019s not a great time to be a climate change scientist in the federal government.\u201d \u2022 This article was updated on Tuesday September 24 2019 to add a statement from the National Park Service.

We had a right giggle about it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c81c588122c497955c2e59399a8868ae9a58d06\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c81c588122c497955c2e59399a8868ae9a58d06/0_0_5467_8353/654.jpg\" alt=\"Top left: Lydia McCartney and Aimee; bottom right: Lydia, Cathy Teese, Autumn McCartney and Aimee at Cathy\u2019s wedding in 1999.\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Top left: Lydia McCartney and Aimee; bottom right: Lydia, Cathy Teese, Autumn McCartney and Aimee at Cathy\u2019s wedding in 1999.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Cathy Teese</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Aimee grew more rebellious. At 14, she started drinking. Often she would have a drink early in the morning and her school would phone Cathy to complain. Aimee would stay out late, and Cathy would tick her off, but Aimee could always talk her round. \u201cShe had the gift of the gab. She was really popular. She was funny, she won over everybody.\u201d What made her special, Cathy says, is that she never judged others. \u201cYou could have four heads and no legs and she wouldn\u2019t be arsed. She was amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The drinking got worse. Cathy encouraged Aimee to come out Thai boxing with the rest of the family, but she wouldn\u2019t. When they came back home, they would find that Aimee could have got through five bottles of beer. \u201cShe was battling stuff in her own head,\u201d Cathy says. \u201cShe talked to me about her mum. She\u2019d say she wished she had what we had as a family.\u201d Even though Cathy treated her like her own, Aimee was conscious that she wasn\u2019t her daughter. \u201cLiving with girls who call me Mum, that\u2019s a smack in the face,\u201d Cathy says.</p> \n<p>The more Aimee drank, the more worried Cathy became about the influence her niece was having on her own children. \u201cI spoke to social services; it got to the stage where it was too much to cope with.\u201d At 15, Aimee went to live with her grandmother in Deal, Kent. She returned briefly to Cathy\u2019s home, and tried her best. But by then she was also abusing substances. \u201cI had a rule that if you\u2019re drinking and doing drugs, I can\u2019t have you around the house. It\u2019s probably one of my regrets,\u201d Cathy says. Even now, you can still see her weighing it up. \u201cBut maybe not, because I didn\u2019t want my girls to see what I\u2019d seen when I was growing up.\u201d</p> \n<p>At 17, Aimee was given a council house. In retrospect, Cathy says this was almost as dangerous as providing her with nothing. \u201cIt was a proper bloody house, with a dining room and everything. She couldn\u2019t cope with that. The whole street was terrace housing, and it was all bums outside. I remember walking down the street and every house was occupied by young people.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s most vulnerable young people had been provided for, but not supported, given homes to play adults in, doss, get wasted and deal drugs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/17/were-telling-the-stories-of-those-who-died-homeless-heres-why\">We're telling the stories of those who died homeless \u2013 here's why</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Aimee was moved into a flat \u2013 smaller, more practical, in a better location. She was almost 20, clean and pregnant. Although she and the baby\u2019s father broke up, she embarked on the happiest, most stable period of her life. \u201cShe was fantastic, a natural with babies,\u201d says Cathy. \u201cShe didn\u2019t need teaching anything. I\u2019d ask her advice as much as the other way round. At school meetings, she was faultless.\u201d Aimee volunteered as a cleaner in a care home when her daughter, Emily*, was at nursery. At this stage, Cathy and Aimee were more like sisters. Cathy split up with her partner of 22 years, and it was her niece, now 24, she looked to for comfort. \u201cShe was the first person I went to. She was just there for me.\u201d They would sit in pyjamas and Aimee would roll cigarettes. \u201cI was off the ciggies so I\u2019d say, \u2018Let me just have one\u2019 and she\u2019d be like, \u2018No.\u2019\u201d Aimee was reckless herself, but a strict disciplinarian with those she loved.</p> \n<p>Everything seemed too good to be true. Then Aimee became involved with an abusive man. She started drinking and taking drugs again, and handed Emily over to another aunt because she couldn\u2019t cope. Before long she had lost her house and was living on the streets. Cathy lost contact with her.</p> \n<p>Five years ago, when Cathy was pregnant with her son Earl, she heard Aimee was homeless. \u201cSomeone said: \u2018Your Aimee\u2019s begging outside Sainsbury\u2019s,\u2019 and I went: \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 She said: \u2018Yeah, I took a photo of her.\u2019\u201d How did she feel? \u201cDevastated. We\u2019ve lost so many people in our family to drugs. I thought about my mum, who was close to Aimee. I thought, bloody hell, it\u2019s not fair on her.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"efd17d3a20097ab7763d88b34991b7aa9c4b901e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efd17d3a20097ab7763d88b34991b7aa9c4b901e/0_221_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cathy Teese is still coming to terms with her niece Aimee\u2019s death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cathy Teese is still coming to terms with her niece Aimee\u2019s death.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A few months later, Aimee turned up for a traumatic reunion. Cathy had just given birth to Earl after a caesarean section, and by now Aimee, who was bisexual, was living with a woman called Marie. \u201cI\u2019d just had a C-section, and I was at home in the bath in terrible pain. In marches Aimee up the stairs into the bathroom. She was pissed as a fart. She was just so overwhelmed with Earl, because she\u2019d had a little brother, Mikey, and Mikey had died. All she kept saying to me while I was pregnant was: \u2018I hope it\u2019s a boy, hope it\u2019s a boy.\u2019 And she was just crying and stroking his face. I didn\u2019t want to take that moment away from her.\u201d But she knew she didn\u2019t want Aimee to return in this condition. \u201cI\u2019d just had a baby. I couldn\u2019t have her coming around like this. I was gutted, though. I felt I\u2019d turned my back on her.\u201d</p> \n<p>In November 2018, Aimee turned up unannounced at her grandmother\u2019s house and stayed for a couple of weeks. Cathy says Aimee knew her nan, Cathy\u2019s mother, would forgive her anything. But one day Aimee said she was going out for cigarettes, and they never saw her again.</p> \n<p>Michelle Langan, the homelessness campaigner who saw Aimee hours before she died, has been listening intently; her charity, the Paper Cup Project, supported Aimee for most of her time on the streets. When Cathy talks of Aimee\u2019s warmth and humour, Langan smiles; she remembers Aimee as a great talker. She never saw her begging, but people would give her money. \u201cA guy I know said to me: \u2018I spoke to her the night she died. I chatted to her and gave her a couple of quid to get a drink.\u2019 That\u2019s the kind of person she was.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Just because you\u2019re homeless doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have a choice about things</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Michelle Langan, outreach worker</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Aimee was generous, always guiding outreach workers to homeless people she considered vulnerable. She was less good at looking after herself. Langan says she looked terrible in the last few weeks of her life. Her gorgeous red hair had been ruined. \u201cOne day she turned up to see us and I said: \u2018What the hell have you done to your hair?\u2019 She said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u2019 It was like somebody had got scissors and chopped it. It was short, just tufts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Aimee was sharing her tent with a male partner at the end of her life, and ticked many boxes for street homeless women \u2013 a survivor of domestic abuse, a substance and alcohol addict, chaotic family background and vulnerable on many fronts.</p> \n<p>Langan says homelessness, and the threat of homelessness, has become much worse in Liverpool in recent years. In May, an average of 86 people used the council\u2019s emergency homeless refuge, Labre House, every night. Last year, more than 5,000 used the council\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.homeless.org.uk/homeless-england/service/liverpool-city-council-housing-options-service\" title=\"\">Housing Options</a> service, which aims to prevent families from becoming homeless. Langan counts the causes on her fingers \u2013 austerity, universal credit, the bedroom tax, plus cuts to mental health, addiction and homelessness services at a time when the need for them is increasing.</p> \n<p>Does she think that, with more resources, Aimee might still be alive? \u201cYes, she could have gone into rehab 20 times, and the 21st time it might have worked for her. At the moment it\u2019s like: this is your one and only chance and if you fuck it up, you don\u2019t get another.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cathy is less certain Aimee could have been saved. \u201cWas she let down? Personally I don\u2019t think so. I think she was given the help from a young age all the way through. I think Stephen, my brother who died, was also given a lot of help.\u201d</p> \n<p>Why wasn\u2019t she in a hostel, at the very least? Langan says Aimee hated hostels, but that Liverpool is better than most cities in its provision for homeless people. \u201cLiverpool has got shelter available every night,\u201d she says. \u201cWe fought for this. Beforehand, all over the country it was just when the temperature was -3C or something you opened up a shelter, so I just kept battering the council about this. In the end, the mayor, Joe Anderson, decided to set up a shelter that was open every single night.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0adf93ef18a6f3b954d65118a720cd88fd045640\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0adf93ef18a6f3b954d65118a720cd88fd045640/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayor Joe Anderson at Labre House, a shelter which is open every night from 8pm to 8am.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In January, mayor Joe Anderson announced that he would remove all tents from Liverpool city centre.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liverpool City Council</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://liverpool.gov.uk/housing/homeless-or-at-risk/labre-house-night-hub/\" title=\"\">Labre House</a> is named after the patron saint of homelessness, Benedict Joseph Labre. Unlike many shelters it offers refuge to anybody who is homeless, including those without recourse to public funds \u2013 mostly on mats or in sleeping bags in two long dormitories. It\u2019s a start, Langan says, but far from perfect. \u201cWe speak to people on the streets and feed that back to the council. I was speaking to one guy and said: \u2018Are you going to Labre tonight?\u2019 And he said: \u2018I\u2019m a recovering drinker, and if I\u2019m in a room where I can smell drink, that\u2019s it for me.\u2019 And it can be very intimidating for survivors of domestic violence. So it\u2019s not suitable for everybody, but it\u2019s better than nothing. When I asked Aimee about it she\u2019d say: \u2018Nah, it\u2019s not for me.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=320%2C000&amp;title=people%20are%20currently%20homeless%2C%20according%20to%20Shelter%0A\" data-alt=\"320,000 people are currently homeless according to Shelter\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=320%2C000&amp;title=people%20are%20currently%20homeless%2C%20according%20to%20Shelter%0A\">320,000 people are currently homeless according to Shelter</a> \n</figure> \n<p>When Langan started the Paper Cup Project three years ago, she coaxed and, when necessary, shamed local politicians into walking the streets with her to acknowledge the extent of the homelessness problem. \u201cJoe and I used to fight like cats and dogs. We hated each other.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause in the papers he denied Liverpool had a homelessness problem for ages. He was fed misleading facts and figures, and I kept going: \u2018This is bullshit.\u2019 He\u2019d say: \u2018We\u2019ve only got 12 homeless people,\u2019 because the government said that when you count rough sleepers they have to be bedded down, so if someone is sitting in a doorway, they\u2019re not counted. I got a couple of council cabinet members to come out with us, and they went back to Joe and said: \u2018She\u2019s actually right.\u2019 I then had a chat with him. So now we\u2019re on the same page, and that\u2019s great.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Langan, homelessness is a political problem. The Labour party made homelessness a priority when it came to power in 1997, and claimed its Rough Sleepers Initiative reduced rough sleeping by around three-quarters. In March this year, the Conservative government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/james-brokenshire-confirms-funding-to-help-people-off-the-streets\" title=\"\">promised \u00a346m over the next two years</a> to help get people off the streets (providing 2,600 beds and 750 extra support staff), but Langan is scathing about its efforts. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have a homelessness problem in 2019. Homeless people don\u2019t have a vote, so the Tory government doesn\u2019t give a shit about them.\u201d Is it incompetence? \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s cruelty and greed. We shouldn\u2019t have people sleeping in doorways in a rich country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both she and Cathy call it an uncaring culture. \u201cSociety has become callous and cold. It\u2019s me, me, me,\u201d Langan says. Cathy nods. \u201cIt\u2019s completely changed,\u201d she says. \u201cJust seeing people mocking each other, saying: \u2018I\u2019ve got this, you\u2019ve got nothing.\u2019\u201d They talk about common attitudes to homeless people \u2013 be grateful for what you\u2019re given, don\u2019t complain, you are the undeserving poor. \u201cThere was a homeless lad we knew who was a vegetarian,\u201d Langan says, \u201cand when people gave him a ham butty he\u2019d be like: \u2018No thanks, I\u2019m a vegetarian.\u2019 And some people would be like: \u2018Oooh, I tried to give him a butty, and he refused it!\u2019 They\u2019d take offence. I\u2019d be like: \u2018Well, did you actually ask him what he wanted?\u2019 Just because you\u2019re homeless doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have a choice about things.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You can\u2019t cut and cut and cut, and not accept consequences.

You wouldn\u2019t have met her and gone: \u2018She\u2019s a pain in the arse.\u2019 You\u2019d say: \u2018Isn\u2019t she a cracking girl?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Outside the restaurant we\u2019ve been talking in, two people are bedding down for the night. Both knew Aimee and say she was funny and loud. Mary* tells us she is 17 weeks pregnant and still taking heroin. Moses, a middle-aged man who could pass for elderly, is also an addict. He is filthy, sharp and welcoming. We sit down with them. Moses has a shocking abscess that gnaws deep into a knuckle.</p> \n<p>Two young women approach, and one hands over a large pizza box. Moses politely asks what it contains. \u201cLadies, don\u2019t be offended, but if it\u2019s the remains and it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s better to put it in the bin than give it to me.\u201d The women stare at him, aghast. \u201cRight! Just leave it with him!\u201d screams one, before they stomp off into the night. The box contains the sodden remains of pizza and chips, and a half-eaten chicken leg.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.whitechapelcentre.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Whitechapel Centre</a>, Liverpool\u2019s leading homeless and housing charity, is based in a Victorian school that has seen better days. The smell is overpowering \u2013 booze, fags and sweat. Outside, men (nearly all the service users here are men) smoke by themselves or in huddles. Inside, clients are being served cooked breakfasts, showering, getting legal advice, benefits help or support with their search for accommodation. One man is having his hair cut.</p> \n<p>David Carter, the chief executive of the Whitechapel Centre and Labre House, has worked with homeless people for decades. He measures the crisis in bald statistics. Five years ago, 1,800 people came through the Whitechapel\u2019s doors; last year, it was 4,025. In 2014, the biggest cause of homelessness was relationship breakdown; now it\u2019s debt. \u201cThe impact of welfare reforms has had such a deep impact on people\u2019s ability to sustain accommodation,\u201d he says. Few of the people they see are simply homeless \u2013 71% have drug or alcohol addictions, 61% have mental health problems, 50% have escaped or experienced abuse.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"8a1335ede24ee2e007527393919914d567092d80\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a1335ede24ee2e007527393919914d567092d80/0_228_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Langan of the Paper Cup Project, on the streets of Liverpool city centre, close to where Aimee died .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Langan of the Paper Cup Project, on the streets of Liverpool city centre, close to where Aimee died.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The problems are increasingly complex. For example, there are more and more long-term IV substance abusers with amputated limbs needing adapted properties. While the level of need has risen for many clients, austerity, welfare reforms and the economic downturn have all had an impact. \u201cA lot of the preventive services have folded,\u201d Carter says. \u201cSo not only do we have more people coming through, but, at the same time, the options for those people have also decreased.\u201d He says the Whitechapel is lucky \u2013 the charity gets \u00a32.2m a year from the council to fund its services and its 90 staff. But it\u2019s still peanuts. How much money does he need? Double maybe, he says.</p> \n<p>We are joined by Liverpool\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, who bombards us with more figures. By next year, Liverpool\u2019s budget will have been slashed by \u00a3444m in a decade, or 64% in real terms \u2013 more than any other UK city. Anderson sounds like Alexei Sayle, sticks the boot into political adversaries with the same relish and has a fondness for the F-word. \u201cWe are spending \u00a350m on housing benefit, which mainly goes to the private sector. Is that not fucking madness? If you built more social housing you wouldn\u2019t be paying that housing benefit bill. It\u2019s absolutely crazy and incompetent.\u201d</p> \n<p>We ask Anderson the official number of rough sleepers in Liverpool city centre. He looks at Carter. \u201cWhat\u2019s your version?\u201d Carter laughs. As Langan said the other night, there are many ways of recording the statistics.</p> \n<p>\u201cEach month, our outreach workers record every homeless person they see,\u201d Carter says. \u201cLast month, we saw 76 people bedded down. It has been pretty stable over the past 12 months. Of them, I would say we got 55 into new or existing accommodation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both men say there are homeless fakes \u2013 people who come into the city to beg, to feed addictions or just make a bit of cash. But they are a small minority. Their priority is to get the genuinely homeless off the street. \u201cThe first rule is: \u2018No second night out.\u2019 When we identify someone sleeping rough, we have them accommodated the following day,\u201d Anderson says. Another motto is: \u201cThere\u2019s always room inside\u201d \u2013 and Anderson insists there is, now that Labre House has opened.</p> \n<p>But the fact remains that both Aimee Teese and Richard Kehoe were street homeless when they died. How does Anderson feel about them dying within three months of each other in tents on the streets of his city? \u201cAbsolute anger. When we talk about eradicating homelessness, it\u2019s not just about moving them out of tents, it\u2019s not just about finding them accommodation, it\u2019s about finding them a job, it\u2019s about changing their lifestyle.\u201d Aimee was imprisoned in the run-up to Christmas 2018, just after disappearing from her grandmother\u2019s home, and Anderson says he was angry when he heard that she had been released, \u201cstill addicted, with all the demons she still had to face \u2013 and we weren\u2019t told about it. And the worst thing is she stayed a bit out of the city centre in a grim area next to a housing estate that we\u2019ve got boarded up. If we\u2019d known about it, Whitechapel could have done something. She might not have died.\u201d</p> \n<p>Who is Anderson most angry with? \u201cThe system. Everybody. Me!\u201d How has he messed up? \u201cI feel guilty because I manage a city council, a system, that is not joined up. It hurts. I remember David Cameron coming in and talking about the \u2018big society\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019s the fucking broken society. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with. And you can\u2019t cut and cut and cut, and not accept consequences. Aimee\u2019s\u2019s death is a mixture of lack of joined-up thinking and cuts. If we\u2019d had more public health workers connecting into probation, connecting into the Prison Service, we would have been told about her.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is certainly true that people are slipping through some very leaky nets. But it\u2019s not correct that nobody knew Aimee was living in a tent. After all, Langan visited her on the night she died.</p> \n<p>Why does Anderson believe that getting rid of tents is the answer? Many homeless people say a tent gives them privacy and a degree of warmth. Anderson insists that is the wrong starting point \u2013 there is no reason for anybody to be homeless in Liverpool; every night there are spare rooms at the YMCA or Labre House. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for anybody to sleep on the streets. If people choose to live on the streets, because they have mental health issues, for instance, then we\u2019ll take that into consideration. But if somebody\u2019s in a tent and they\u2019re jacking up and doing stuff to themselves that no one can see, how are we going to know?\u201d</p> \n<p>Carter and Anderson say that much of the city\u2019s homeless drug dealing is done from within tents. The bottom line, Anderson says, is that tents hide illegal activity and vulnerable people who need support. When he announced the zero-tolerance policy on tents, people were sceptical \u2013 and worse. \u201cI got a lot of shit on Twitter, as we usually do. People say we\u2019re not doing enough. The city\u2019s not doing enough. I get it all the time. People want to blame somebody for the problems we have in the city. They want to get angry with somebody, so they get angry with me.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I didn\u2019t think she would ever be homeless and I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever die.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Cathy Teese</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The mayor has a reputation for grandstanding, but there is no questioning his desire to tackle the crisis. We mention pregnant Mary, who we met on the streets the previous night. Anderson and Carter look at each other. \u201cAh. We know her very, very well,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cAnd you know why she won\u2019t accept accommodation? She\u2019s had children before, she\u2019s a drug user and we have a child protection order on the baby. We have issues with the father of the baby, her partner. She wants to live with him, and the order stops that happening. There\u2019s much more to your story.\u201d His version is consistent with what Mary told us \u2013 she admitted she was still taking heroin. Anderson says, as with Aimee Teese, it would be pointless to address her housing situation without tackling her addiction issues.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>It is late June, almost six months since Aimee died and three months since Anderson announced he was going to remove tents from the streets of Liverpool. We meet up with Langan and Cathy to distribute food and clothes to homeless people. Cathy now volunteers for the Paper Cup Project as an outreach worker. She says it has given her a new sense of purpose.</p> \n<p>Anderson is not the only public official who has been clearing tents from the streets. The Guardian has just revealed that the number of homeless camps forcibly removed by councils across the UK has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/17/removal-of-homeless-camps-trebles-as-charities-warn-of-out-of-control-crisis\">more than trebled in four years</a> (from 72 in 2014 to 254 last year). An encampment was defined as a location where one or more homeless people were living on private or public land. The Guardian also revealed there were 1,241 complaints to councils last year regarding \u201ctent cities\u201d and that some councils (including Brighton and East Dorset) charge for the return of seized tents.</p> \n<p>At Aimee\u2019s inquest in April, the coroner recorded that she had been found dead in her tent in the back yard of a disused factory. It was revealed she had a medical history of hepatitis C, and drug and alcohol addiction. In the hours before her death she had smoked crack cocaine with her partner and used heroin \u201cwithin the range of a fatal dose\u201d. She was found by her partner, who returned to the tent after a disagreement with her. Cathy says her niece\u2019s death has turned her life upside down. \u201cIt\u2019s split me and my partner up. He\u2019s a bit younger than I am, and he didn\u2019t understand what I was going through. I kept everything in on myself. And I blame myself a lot as well. I took a lot of the guilt because I shouldn\u2019t have said what I said to her.\u201d What does she mean? \u201cI said: \u2018With drink and drugs, I can\u2019t have you around here.\u2019\u201d She is becoming tearful. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think she would ever be homeless and I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever die.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fa160134b4c6e3c257ded95e8123a23315b987d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fa160134b4c6e3c257ded95e8123a23315b987d/0_0_480_479/480.jpg\" alt=\"Aimee\u2019s inquest recorded that in the hours before her death she had smoked crack cocaine with her partner and used heroin \u2018within the range of a fatal dose\u2019.\" width=\"480\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aimee\u2019s inquest recorded that in the hours before her death she had smoked crack cocaine with her partner and used heroin \u2018within the range of a fatal dose\u2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There isn\u2019t a day Cathy doesn\u2019t think about Aimee.

      "bodyText": "Aimee Teese\u2019s final words to her friend and outreach worker Michelle Langan were: \u201cLook after yourself.\u201d Hours later, on 8 January this year, she was found dead in a tent on the outskirts of Liverpool city centre. Within three months, on 2 April, Richard Kehoe was discovered comatose in a tent opposite the Royal Liverpool hospital. Soon after, he was pronounced dead. Three days later, Liverpool\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, announced he would remove all tents from Liverpool city centre. \u201cWe are going to give people a warning, give them an hour to take their tent down and say: \u2018Here is a place for you to sleep, we will pick you up, take you with your goods.\u2019\u201d It was a dramatic \u2013 possibly draconian \u2013 statement. Anderson called the policy tough love, and said there was no other option. He was not prepared to have homeless people dying on his streets, hidden in tents. \u201cWhen Richard Kehoe or Aimee Teese die, then we have all failed,\u201d he said. In Britain today, there are tents everywhere \u2013 city centres, railway stations, parks and towpaths. They have come to signify our fractured society. This is the seventh-wealthiest country in the world, where the disparity between rich and poor continues to grow, and where, according to Shelter, 320,000 people are homeless (roughly one in 200 of the population). Last year, it was reported by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism that at least 449 people had died in the UK while homeless in the 12 months up to October 2018. We meet Aimee\u2019s aunt, Cathy Teese, in a tapas bar in Liverpool. A 45-year-old special-needs teacher, Cathy\u2019s youthfulness belies the tough life she has led. Her drug-addicted father killed himself by setting fire to the family home when she was 11 (thankfully, there was no one else in the house), and her mother was left to bring up four children alone: Stephen, Aimee\u2019s father John, Paul and Cathy. \u201cLosing our dad hit the four of us in different ways,\u201d she says. \u201cThe older two went to drugs, and me and Paul never touched drugs. I\u2019m too scared of them. I\u2019ve seen too much. I\u2019ve instilled that into my girls as well.\u201d Cathy\u2019s oldest brother, Stephen, died when he was 35. Aimee\u2019s mother, Jackie, who was also dependent on drugs, died aged 29 and was buried alongside Aimee\u2019s brother, Mikey, who died when he was 14 months old. Cathy apologises for rattling off these tragedies. \u201cI must seem heartless. I can talk about it without emotion these days,\u201d she says. But while Cathy is tough, she is also warm and selfless; a woman who has not just survived, but thrived. * * * When Aimee was three years old, she was taken into care and fostered. Cathy, who was 17 and pregnant, fought for contact with her niece. The courts granted once a month, which increased to once a week, and she and Aimee became close. Then, when Cathy was 25, social services called out of the blue. \u201cIt was a Friday afternoon. \u2018Hiya, are you able to take Aimee tonight?\u2019 It was as quick as that because her relationship with the foster parents had broken down.\u201d Cathy\u2019s daughters, Lydia and Autumn, began sharing a room, and Aimee, who was almost 11, got a room to herself. \u201cShe was older. She\u2019d been through a lot more. She had to get the room,\u201d Cathy says. Aimee immediately fitted in. Lydia and Autumn had gained an older sister. Cathy and Aimee had a special bond. \u201cWe\u2019d just lie on the bed and have a conversation. She\u2019d tell me how much she loved me and I\u2019d tell her how much I loved her.\u201d Even as a young teenager, she says, what Aimee wanted most was to be a mum \u2013 to nurture and love a child in a way her own mother had never been able to. \u201cShe had a massive, infectious laugh,\u201d Cathy says. \u201cThe girls would be upstairs with the Spice Girls on and our Aimee was the worst dancer ever, honest to God! She had no rhythm, but my two girls were brilliant. So I used to take the piss. I\u2019d say: \u2018Come on, do the Spice Girls,\u2019 and she\u2019d go: \u2018No, no, no, no, go out of the room and I\u2019ll do it,\u2019 but I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d be by the door and go: \u2018Oh my God!\u2019\u201d Was Aimee upset? \u201cNooo! We had a right giggle about it.\u201d But Aimee grew more rebellious. At 14, she started drinking. Often she would have a drink early in the morning and her school would phone Cathy to complain. Aimee would stay out late, and Cathy would tick her off, but Aimee could always talk her round. \u201cShe had the gift of the gab. She was really popular. She was funny, she won over everybody.\u201d What made her special, Cathy says, is that she never judged others. \u201cYou could have four heads and no legs and she wouldn\u2019t be arsed. She was amazing.\u201d The drinking got worse. Cathy encouraged Aimee to come out Thai boxing with the rest of the family, but she wouldn\u2019t. When they came back home, they would find that Aimee could have got through five bottles of beer. \u201cShe was battling stuff in her own head,\u201d Cathy says. \u201cShe talked to me about her mum. She\u2019d say she wished she had what we had as a family.\u201d Even though Cathy treated her like her own, Aimee was conscious that she wasn\u2019t her daughter. \u201cLiving with girls who call me Mum, that\u2019s a smack in the face,\u201d Cathy says. The more Aimee drank, the more worried Cathy became about the influence her niece was having on her own children. \u201cI spoke to social services; it got to the stage where it was too much to cope with.\u201d At 15, Aimee went to live with her grandmother in Deal, Kent. She returned briefly to Cathy\u2019s home, and tried her best. But by then she was also abusing substances. \u201cI had a rule that if you\u2019re drinking and doing drugs, I can\u2019t have you around the house. It\u2019s probably one of my regrets,\u201d Cathy says. Even now, you can still see her weighing it up. \u201cBut maybe not, because I didn\u2019t want my girls to see what I\u2019d seen when I was growing up.\u201d At 17, Aimee was given a council house. In retrospect, Cathy says this was almost as dangerous as providing her with nothing. \u201cIt was a proper bloody house, with a dining room and everything. She couldn\u2019t cope with that. The whole street was terrace housing, and it was all bums outside. I remember walking down the street and every house was occupied by young people.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s most vulnerable young people had been provided for, but not supported, given homes to play adults in, doss, get wasted and deal drugs. Aimee was moved into a flat \u2013 smaller, more practical, in a better location. She was almost 20, clean and pregnant. Although she and the baby\u2019s father broke up, she embarked on the happiest, most stable period of her life. \u201cShe was fantastic, a natural with babies,\u201d says Cathy. \u201cShe didn\u2019t need teaching anything. I\u2019d ask her advice as much as the other way round. At school meetings, she was faultless.\u201d Aimee volunteered as a cleaner in a care home when her daughter, Emily*, was at nursery. At this stage, Cathy and Aimee were more like sisters. Cathy split up with her partner of 22 years, and it was her niece, now 24, she looked to for comfort. \u201cShe was the first person I went to. She was just there for me.\u201d They would sit in pyjamas and Aimee would roll cigarettes. \u201cI was off the ciggies so I\u2019d say, \u2018Let me just have one\u2019 and she\u2019d be like, \u2018No.\u2019\u201d Aimee was reckless herself, but a strict disciplinarian with those she loved. Everything seemed too good to be true. Then Aimee became involved with an abusive man. She started drinking and taking drugs again, and handed Emily over to another aunt because she couldn\u2019t cope. Before long she had lost her house and was living on the streets. Cathy lost contact with her. Five years ago, when Cathy was pregnant with her son Earl, she heard Aimee was homeless. \u201cSomeone said: \u2018Your Aimee\u2019s begging outside Sainsbury\u2019s,\u2019 and I went: \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 She said: \u2018Yeah, I took a photo of her.\u2019\u201d How did she feel? \u201cDevastated. We\u2019ve lost so many people in our family to drugs. I thought about my mum, who was close to Aimee. I thought, bloody hell, it\u2019s not fair on her.\u201d A few months later, Aimee turned up for a traumatic reunion. Cathy had just given birth to Earl after a caesarean section, and by now Aimee, who was bisexual, was living with a woman called Marie. \u201cI\u2019d just had a C-section, and I was at home in the bath in terrible pain. In marches Aimee up the stairs into the bathroom. She was pissed as a fart. She was just so overwhelmed with Earl, because she\u2019d had a little brother, Mikey, and Mikey had died. All she kept saying to me while I was pregnant was: \u2018I hope it\u2019s a boy, hope it\u2019s a boy.\u2019 And she was just crying and stroking his face. I didn\u2019t want to take that moment away from her.\u201d But she knew she didn\u2019t want Aimee to return in this condition. \u201cI\u2019d just had a baby. I couldn\u2019t have her coming around like this. I was gutted, though. I felt I\u2019d turned my back on her.\u201d In November 2018, Aimee turned up unannounced at her grandmother\u2019s house and stayed for a couple of weeks. Cathy says Aimee knew her nan, Cathy\u2019s mother, would forgive her anything. But one day Aimee said she was going out for cigarettes, and they never saw her again. Michelle Langan, the homelessness campaigner who saw Aimee hours before she died, has been listening intently; her charity, the Paper Cup Project, supported Aimee for most of her time on the streets. When Cathy talks of Aimee\u2019s warmth and humour, Langan smiles; she remembers Aimee as a great talker. She never saw her begging, but people would give her money. \u201cA guy I know said to me: \u2018I spoke to her the night she died. I chatted to her and gave her a couple of quid to get a drink.\u2019 That\u2019s the kind of person she was.\u201d Aimee was generous, always guiding outreach workers to homeless people she considered vulnerable. She was less good at looking after herself. Langan says she looked terrible in the last few weeks of her life. Her gorgeous red hair had been ruined. \u201cOne day she turned up to see us and I said: \u2018What the hell have you done to your hair?\u2019 She said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u2019 It was like somebody had got scissors and chopped it. It was short, just tufts.\u201d Aimee was sharing her tent with a male partner at the end of her life, and ticked many boxes for street homeless women \u2013 a survivor of domestic abuse, a substance and alcohol addict, chaotic family background and vulnerable on many fronts. Langan says homelessness, and the threat of homelessness, has become much worse in Liverpool in recent years. In May, an average of 86 people used the council\u2019s emergency homeless refuge, Labre House, every night. Last year, more than 5,000 used the council\u2019s Housing Options service, which aims to prevent families from becoming homeless. Langan counts the causes on her fingers \u2013 austerity, universal credit, the bedroom tax, plus cuts to mental health, addiction and homelessness services at a time when the need for them is increasing. Does she think that, with more resources, Aimee might still be alive? \u201cYes, she could have gone into rehab 20 times, and the 21st time it might have worked for her. At the moment it\u2019s like: this is your one and only chance and if you fuck it up, you don\u2019t get another.\u201d Cathy is less certain Aimee could have been saved. \u201cWas she let down? Personally I don\u2019t think so. I think she was given the help from a young age all the way through. I think Stephen, my brother who died, was also given a lot of help.\u201d Why wasn\u2019t she in a hostel, at the very least? Langan says Aimee hated hostels, but that Liverpool is better than most cities in its provision for homeless people. \u201cLiverpool has got shelter available every night,\u201d she says. \u201cWe fought for this. Beforehand, all over the country it was just when the temperature was -3C or something you opened up a shelter, so I just kept battering the council about this. In the end, the mayor, Joe Anderson, decided to set up a shelter that was open every single night.\u201d Labre House is named after the patron saint of homelessness, Benedict Joseph Labre. Unlike many shelters it offers refuge to anybody who is homeless, including those without recourse to public funds \u2013 mostly on mats or in sleeping bags in two long dormitories. It\u2019s a start, Langan says, but far from perfect. \u201cWe speak to people on the streets and feed that back to the council. I was speaking to one guy and said: \u2018Are you going to Labre tonight?\u2019 And he said: \u2018I\u2019m a recovering drinker, and if I\u2019m in a room where I can smell drink, that\u2019s it for me.\u2019 And it can be very intimidating for survivors of domestic violence. So it\u2019s not suitable for everybody, but it\u2019s better than nothing. When I asked Aimee about it she\u2019d say: \u2018Nah, it\u2019s not for me.\u2019\u201d When Langan started the Paper Cup Project three years ago, she coaxed and, when necessary, shamed local politicians into walking the streets with her to acknowledge the extent of the homelessness problem. \u201cJoe and I used to fight like cats and dogs. We hated each other.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause in the papers he denied Liverpool had a homelessness problem for ages. He was fed misleading facts and figures, and I kept going: \u2018This is bullshit.\u2019 He\u2019d say: \u2018We\u2019ve only got 12 homeless people,\u2019 because the government said that when you count rough sleepers they have to be bedded down, so if someone is sitting in a doorway, they\u2019re not counted. I got a couple of council cabinet members to come out with us, and they went back to Joe and said: \u2018She\u2019s actually right.\u2019 I then had a chat with him. So now we\u2019re on the same page, and that\u2019s great.\u201d For Langan, homelessness is a political problem. The Labour party made homelessness a priority when it came to power in 1997, and claimed its Rough Sleepers Initiative reduced rough sleeping by around three-quarters. In March this year, the Conservative government promised \u00a346m over the next two years to help get people off the streets (providing 2,600 beds and 750 extra support staff), but Langan is scathing about its efforts. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have a homelessness problem in 2019. Homeless people don\u2019t have a vote, so the Tory government doesn\u2019t give a shit about them.\u201d Is it incompetence? \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s cruelty and greed. We shouldn\u2019t have people sleeping in doorways in a rich country.\u201d Both she and Cathy call it an uncaring culture. \u201cSociety has become callous and cold. It\u2019s me, me, me,\u201d Langan says. Cathy nods. \u201cIt\u2019s completely changed,\u201d she says. \u201cJust seeing people mocking each other, saying: \u2018I\u2019ve got this, you\u2019ve got nothing.\u2019\u201d They talk about common attitudes to homeless people \u2013 be grateful for what you\u2019re given, don\u2019t complain, you are the undeserving poor. \u201cThere was a homeless lad we knew who was a vegetarian,\u201d Langan says, \u201cand when people gave him a ham butty he\u2019d be like: \u2018No thanks, I\u2019m a vegetarian.\u2019 And some people would be like: \u2018Oooh, I tried to give him a butty, and he refused it!\u2019 They\u2019d take offence. I\u2019d be like: \u2018Well, did you actually ask him what he wanted?\u2019 Just because you\u2019re homeless doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have a choice about things.\u201d As we leave, Cathy says she hopes she\u2019s not been too harsh on Aimee. \u201cShe didn\u2019t set out to hurt people, she just did along the way. You wouldn\u2019t have met her and gone: \u2018She\u2019s a pain in the arse.\u2019 You\u2019d say: \u2018Isn\u2019t she a cracking girl?\u2019\u201d Outside the restaurant we\u2019ve been talking in, two people are bedding down for the night. Both knew Aimee and say she was funny and loud. Mary* tells us she is 17 weeks pregnant and still taking heroin. Moses, a middle-aged man who could pass for elderly, is also an addict. He is filthy, sharp and welcoming. We sit down with them. Moses has a shocking abscess that gnaws deep into a knuckle. Two young women approach, and one hands over a large pizza box. Moses politely asks what it contains. \u201cLadies, don\u2019t be offended, but if it\u2019s the remains and it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s better to put it in the bin than give it to me.\u201d The women stare at him, aghast. \u201cRight! Just leave it with him!\u201d screams one, before they stomp off into the night. The box contains the sodden remains of pizza and chips, and a half-eaten chicken leg. * * * The Whitechapel Centre, Liverpool\u2019s leading homeless and housing charity, is based in a Victorian school that has seen better days. The smell is overpowering \u2013 booze, fags and sweat. Outside, men (nearly all the service users here are men) smoke by themselves or in huddles. Inside, clients are being served cooked breakfasts, showering, getting legal advice, benefits help or support with their search for accommodation. One man is having his hair cut. David Carter, the chief executive of the Whitechapel Centre and Labre House, has worked with homeless people for decades. He measures the crisis in bald statistics. Five years ago, 1,800 people came through the Whitechapel\u2019s doors; last year, it was 4,025. In 2014, the biggest cause of homelessness was relationship breakdown; now it\u2019s debt. \u201cThe impact of welfare reforms has had such a deep impact on people\u2019s ability to sustain accommodation,\u201d he says. Few of the people they see are simply homeless \u2013 71% have drug or alcohol addictions, 61% have mental health problems, 50% have escaped or experienced abuse. The problems are increasingly complex. For example, there are more and more long-term IV substance abusers with amputated limbs needing adapted properties. While the level of need has risen for many clients, austerity, welfare reforms and the economic downturn have all had an impact. \u201cA lot of the preventive services have folded,\u201d Carter says. \u201cSo not only do we have more people coming through, but, at the same time, the options for those people have also decreased.\u201d He says the Whitechapel is lucky \u2013 the charity gets \u00a32.2m a year from the council to fund its services and its 90 staff. But it\u2019s still peanuts. How much money does he need? Double maybe, he says. We are joined by Liverpool\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, who bombards us with more figures. By next year, Liverpool\u2019s budget will have been slashed by \u00a3444m in a decade, or 64% in real terms \u2013 more than any other UK city. Anderson sounds like Alexei Sayle, sticks the boot into political adversaries with the same relish and has a fondness for the F-word. \u201cWe are spending \u00a350m on housing benefit, which mainly goes to the private sector. Is that not fucking madness? If you built more social housing you wouldn\u2019t be paying that housing benefit bill. It\u2019s absolutely crazy and incompetent.\u201d We ask Anderson the official number of rough sleepers in Liverpool city centre. He looks at Carter. \u201cWhat\u2019s your version?\u201d Carter laughs. As Langan said the other night, there are many ways of recording the statistics. \u201cEach month, our outreach workers record every homeless person they see,\u201d Carter says. \u201cLast month, we saw 76 people bedded down. It has been pretty stable over the past 12 months. Of them, I would say we got 55 into new or existing accommodation.\u201d Both men say there are homeless fakes \u2013 people who come into the city to beg, to feed addictions or just make a bit of cash. But they are a small minority. Their priority is to get the genuinely homeless off the street. \u201cThe first rule is: \u2018No second night out.\u2019 When we identify someone sleeping rough, we have them accommodated the following day,\u201d Anderson says. Another motto is: \u201cThere\u2019s always room inside\u201d \u2013 and Anderson insists there is, now that Labre House has opened. But the fact remains that both Aimee Teese and Richard Kehoe were street homeless when they died. How does Anderson feel about them dying within three months of each other in tents on the streets of his city? \u201cAbsolute anger. When we talk about eradicating homelessness, it\u2019s not just about moving them out of tents, it\u2019s not just about finding them accommodation, it\u2019s about finding them a job, it\u2019s about changing their lifestyle.\u201d Aimee was imprisoned in the run-up to Christmas 2018, just after disappearing from her grandmother\u2019s home, and Anderson says he was angry when he heard that she had been released, \u201cstill addicted, with all the demons she still had to face \u2013 and we weren\u2019t told about it. And the worst thing is she stayed a bit out of the city centre in a grim area next to a housing estate that we\u2019ve got boarded up. If we\u2019d known about it, Whitechapel could have done something. She might not have died.\u201d Who is Anderson most angry with? \u201cThe system. Everybody. Me!\u201d How has he messed up? \u201cI feel guilty because I manage a city council, a system, that is not joined up. It hurts. I remember David Cameron coming in and talking about the \u2018big society\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019s the fucking broken society. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with. And you can\u2019t cut and cut and cut, and not accept consequences. Aimee\u2019s\u2019s death is a mixture of lack of joined-up thinking and cuts. If we\u2019d had more public health workers connecting into probation, connecting into the Prison Service, we would have been told about her.\u201d It is certainly true that people are slipping through some very leaky nets. But it\u2019s not correct that nobody knew Aimee was living in a tent. After all, Langan visited her on the night she died. Why does Anderson believe that getting rid of tents is the answer? Many homeless people say a tent gives them privacy and a degree of warmth. Anderson insists that is the wrong starting point \u2013 there is no reason for anybody to be homeless in Liverpool; every night there are spare rooms at the YMCA or Labre House. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for anybody to sleep on the streets. If people choose to live on the streets, because they have mental health issues, for instance, then we\u2019ll take that into consideration. But if somebody\u2019s in a tent and they\u2019re jacking up and doing stuff to themselves that no one can see, how are we going to know?\u201d Carter and Anderson say that much of the city\u2019s homeless drug dealing is done from within tents. The bottom line, Anderson says, is that tents hide illegal activity and vulnerable people who need support. When he announced the zero-tolerance policy on tents, people were sceptical \u2013 and worse. \u201cI got a lot of shit on Twitter, as we usually do. People say we\u2019re not doing enough. The city\u2019s not doing enough. I get it all the time. People want to blame somebody for the problems we have in the city. They want to get angry with somebody, so they get angry with me.\u201d The mayor has a reputation for grandstanding, but there is no questioning his desire to tackle the crisis. We mention pregnant Mary, who we met on the streets the previous night. Anderson and Carter look at each other. \u201cAh. We know her very, very well,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cAnd you know why she won\u2019t accept accommodation? She\u2019s had children before, she\u2019s a drug user and we have a child protection order on the baby. We have issues with the father of the baby, her partner. She wants to live with him, and the order stops that happening. There\u2019s much more to your story.\u201d His version is consistent with what Mary told us \u2013 she admitted she was still taking heroin. Anderson says, as with Aimee Teese, it would be pointless to address her housing situation without tackling her addiction issues. * * * It is late June, almost six months since Aimee died and three months since Anderson announced he was going to remove tents from the streets of Liverpool. We meet up with Langan and Cathy to distribute food and clothes to homeless people. Cathy now volunteers for the Paper Cup Project as an outreach worker. She says it has given her a new sense of purpose. Anderson is not the only public official who has been clearing tents from the streets. The Guardian has just revealed that the number of homeless camps forcibly removed by councils across the UK has more than trebled in four years (from 72 in 2014 to 254 last year). An encampment was defined as a location where one or more homeless people were living on private or public land. The Guardian also revealed there were 1,241 complaints to councils last year regarding \u201ctent cities\u201d and that some councils (including Brighton and East Dorset) charge for the return of seized tents. At Aimee\u2019s inquest in April, the coroner recorded that she had been found dead in her tent in the back yard of a disused factory. It was revealed she had a medical history of hepatitis C, and drug and alcohol addiction. In the hours before her death she had smoked crack cocaine with her partner and used heroin \u201cwithin the range of a fatal dose\u201d. She was found by her partner, who returned to the tent after a disagreement with her. Cathy says her niece\u2019s death has turned her life upside down. \u201cIt\u2019s split me and my partner up. He\u2019s a bit younger than I am, and he didn\u2019t understand what I was going through. I kept everything in on myself. And I blame myself a lot as well. I took a lot of the guilt because I shouldn\u2019t have said what I said to her.\u201d What does she mean? \u201cI said: \u2018With drink and drugs, I can\u2019t have you around here.\u2019\u201d She is becoming tearful. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think she would ever be homeless and I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever die.\u201d There isn\u2019t a day Cathy doesn\u2019t think about Aimee. But one huge positive has come out of all this. She whips a photo out of her wallet. \u201cThat\u2019s me, Aimee and her daughter Emily when she was a baby.\u201d Cathy had been close to Emily, who is now 10 and still living with another aunt. Four years after losing contact with each other, she and Emily are rebuilding their relationship. Cathy is overjoyed to have her back in her life. \u201cI had her for the day a few weeks ago,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting to know each other again and we had an absolute ball. We went swimming and went to Anfield to watch the match. The kids love that they\u2019ve got a new cousin.\u201d Cathy still hasn\u2019t come to terms with Aimee\u2019s death, even though she half expected it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would come to this at 30. It sounds cold, but I thought she would die from drugs and things, but that she would be older.\u201d It was Cathy who identified the body. What shocked her most was Aimee\u2019s hair. \u201cShe had gorgeous hair. She was so proud of it \u2013 long and dyed red. And when I went to see her, it was all chopped off.\u201d She was left alone with Aimee\u2019s body. Cathy says it took her ages to say anything, then she let rip. \u201cI gave her a bollocking. I gave her a really good bollocking. I told her off like a proper parent. I said: \u2018I\u2019m totally fucking pissed off with you.\u2019 I was just kind of ranting. It felt good.\u201d She is laughing and crying as she says this. \u201cAnd then when I finished bollocking her, I told her I loved her.\u201d Indicated names (*) have been changed.

      "bodyText": "In September 2007, as credit was \u201ccrunched\u201d and the financial crisis began to unfold, a group of economists and environmentalists, including the future Green party MP Caroline Lucas, met regularly in my small London flat. Supping on comfort food and wine, we argued furiously while drafting a plan we hoped would transform the economy and protect the ecosystem. We called it the Green New Deal. Little did we know that the ideas we seeded then would be adopted by a shooting star of the Democratic party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as part of her bid for a New York congressional seat in 2018. Fast forward to 2019 and the Green New Deal is now at the centre of the 2020 US presidential campaign. Bernie Sanders last week declared the climate crisis a national emergency and launched his version of the deal \u2013 a $16.3 trillion plan that includes massive investment in renewable energy, green infrastructure for climate resilience and money for research.

      "body": "<p>To say I have a love-hate relationship with ivy is too simplistic. Because one of the largest organisms in our garden is a much-valued ivy tod (bush), draped over the top of a decapitated 3m-tall cypress stump. Yet I have also had moments of despair, such as the day I realised ivy had choked out the canopy of one of our favourite holly trees, which has never truly recovered.</p> <p>Come September I forgive ivy its relentless self-promotion and when I walked up the lane today, where it has also smothered a whole section of oak hedge, I fell in love with its imperishable emerald all over again. The flowering bushes at this spot swooned in invertebrate drone. Here in one 4m stretch of <em>Hedera helix</em> were colour, complexity, music and drama \u2013 all of it driven by those weird and completely unprepossessing ivy flowers.</p> <p>Each globe of blooms begins as a spray of about 20 tiny lime balls on separate stalks arising from a terminal node. Later, these round buds elongate into a sort of cone topped by a nipple, from which peel back five green sepals.

      "bodyText": "To say I have a love-hate relationship with ivy is too simplistic. Because one of the largest organisms in our garden is a much-valued ivy tod (bush), draped over the top of a decapitated 3m-tall cypress stump. Yet I have also had moments of despair, such as the day I realised ivy had choked out the canopy of one of our favourite holly trees, which has never truly recovered. Come September I forgive ivy its relentless self-promotion and when I walked up the lane today, where it has also smothered a whole section of oak hedge, I fell in love with its imperishable emerald all over again. The flowering bushes at this spot swooned in invertebrate drone. Here in one 4m stretch of Hedera helix were colour, complexity, music and drama \u2013 all of it driven by those weird and completely unprepossessing ivy flowers. Each globe of blooms begins as a spray of about 20 tiny lime balls on separate stalks arising from a terminal node. Later, these round buds elongate into a sort of cone topped by a nipple, from which peel back five green sepals. The whole structure, even before it opens, seems to be magnetic for feeding insects, which lick and chew the surfaces remorselessly. But finally the cone bursts open and out spring five crinkled stamens, smothered in pollen. That whole moment of vegetable sex is electrifying for insects and inspires the dense whine that now envelops me. Centre stage are the gorgeous little solitary ivy bees, Colletes hederae, which were not named for science until 1993 and which have spread across southern Britain since they were first recorded in this country in 2001.

One by one, Sophie McCann lists the degradations of life for refugees detained on Lesbos, the Greek island on the frontline of a new surge of asylum seekers desperate to reach Europe.</p> <p>McCann, a British advocacy manager with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, like other aid workers, is now raising the alarm: at least 24,000 men, women and children trapped in vastly overcrowded Aegean island camps are being subjected to conditions so harrowing they bear all the hallmarks of humanitarian catastrophe. Four years after the greatest migration crisis in modern times, there are fears history is repeating itself.</p> <p>\u201cThe level of human suffering is just indescribable,\u201d says McCann, adding that incidents of self-harm, even among toddlers, have risen sharply. \u201cI struggle to find the right words because none can convey the sheer misery and inhumanity of a situation that in Europe is frankly unbelievable.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/02/greece-sets-out-emergency-plans-to-tackle-surge-of-migrant-arrivals\">Greece sets out emergency plans to tackle surge of migrant arrivals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The drama unfolding on Europe\u2019s south-eastern periphery follows the abrupt rise in numbers making the dangerous sea crossing from Turkey.</p> <p>With a brazenness unseen since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/eu-deal-turkey-migrants-refugees-q-and-a\">EU struck a controversial accord with Ankara</a> to stem flows in 2016, smugglers are again landing boatloads of would-be asylum seekers on the beaches of Lesbos, Samos, Kos, Leros and Chios.</p> <p>In July and August more than 13,000 people landed on Greek shores, more than half of all sea arrivals to the country in 2019. With the uptick continuing into September, the surge has sparked fears that Europe is on the verge of a new refugee crisis \u2013 despite numbers still being a fraction of those in 2016 when as many as 2,000 people a day were reportedly disembarking from boats.</p> <p>At least a third of the newcomers are unaccompanied minors, according to the UN refugee agency. \u201cIt has happened so quickly, aid organisations feel overwhelmed,\u201d said Sofia Malmqvist at the Athens branch of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation is particularly acute on the islands. We are deeply concerned. There are a lot of children. What we are seeing is authorities [pursuing] short-term solutions such as moving some to the mainland and into tents, but what is going to happen in the winter?\u201d</p> <p>The influx comes amid mounting anti-refugee sentiment in Turkey on the back of the country\u2019s economic woes and growing unemployment. In recent weeks the president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/05/erdogan-ill-let-syrian-refugees-leave-turkey-for-west-unless-safe-zone-set-up\">Recep Tayyip Erdo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/05/erdogan-ill-let-syrian-refugees-leave-turkey-for-west-unless-safe-zone-set-up\">\u011fan,</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/05/erdogan-ill-let-syrian-refugees-leave-turkey-for-west-unless-safe-zone-set-up\"> </a>has repeatedly warned that his government will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/05/erdogan-ill-let-syrian-refugees-leave-turkey-for-west-unless-safe-zone-set-up\">forced to \u201copen the gates\u201d if the EU fails to deliver \u20ac6bn</a> in promised funds \u2013 remuneration set out in the landmark accord \u2013 and Ankara is prevented from moving ahead with plans to create a safe zone in northern Syria where refugees could be relocated.</p> <p>Turkey currently hosts close to 4 million displaced Syrians with the prospect of that number escalating if yet more flee across the border from Idlib, the rebel stronghold that has become the focus of a renewed offensive by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and Damascus\u2019 backers in Moscow.</p> <p>As a result of the summer rise, Greece has overtaken Italy and Spain as the European Union\u2019s busiest entry point for illegal migration.</p> <p>In Athens, NGOs attribute the increase to the Turkish coastguard deliberately relaxing patrols. EU diplomats speak of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ability to hold the bloc to ransom by \u201copening and closing the faucet\u201d.</p> <p>Amid fears of a populist backlash, Germany, which took in more Syrian refugees than any other EU member state in 2015, has announced it is watching the illegal sea crossings with mounting concern.</p> <p>Like Greece\u2019s new centre-right government, Berlin sees a solution in greater numbers of asylum seekers being sent back to Turkey. The latest arrivals topped the agenda when Greece\u2019s foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, held talks in Berlin on Monday in which it was stressed it was vital that Ankara stick with the pact it has agreed with the EU.</p> <p>In almost four years since the EU-Turkey accord was reached, barely 1,000 have been returned \u2013 a reflection of the human rights concerns voiced by Athens\u2019 former leftist administration in deporting migrants back to Turkey. Under the agreement refugees have to process asylum claims on \u201centry point\u201d islands before being allowed to move on.</p> <p>In recent weeks Greek authorities have stepped up emergency evacuations, transferring some 1,800 people deemed to be vulnerable to camps on the mainland.</p> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d says McCann, \u201cthese cycles of emergency decongestion won\u2019t solve the underlining problems.

      "bodyText": "Children being bitten by scorpions, rats and snakes; hundreds being forced to use a single shower; the stench of human excrement never far away; and food shortages becoming the norm. One by one, Sophie McCann lists the degradations of life for refugees detained on Lesbos, the Greek island on the frontline of a new surge of asylum seekers desperate to reach Europe. McCann, a British advocacy manager with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, like other aid workers, is now raising the alarm: at least 24,000 men, women and children trapped in vastly overcrowded Aegean island camps are being subjected to conditions so harrowing they bear all the hallmarks of humanitarian catastrophe. Four years after the greatest migration crisis in modern times, there are fears history is repeating itself. \u201cThe level of human suffering is just indescribable,\u201d says McCann, adding that incidents of self-harm, even among toddlers, have risen sharply. \u201cI struggle to find the right words because none can convey the sheer misery and inhumanity of a situation that in Europe is frankly unbelievable.\u201d The drama unfolding on Europe\u2019s south-eastern periphery follows the abrupt rise in numbers making the dangerous sea crossing from Turkey. With a brazenness unseen since the EU struck a controversial accord with Ankara to stem flows in 2016, smugglers are again landing boatloads of would-be asylum seekers on the beaches of Lesbos, Samos, Kos, Leros and Chios. In July and August more than 13,000 people landed on Greek shores, more than half of all sea arrivals to the country in 2019. With the uptick continuing into September, the surge has sparked fears that Europe is on the verge of a new refugee crisis \u2013 despite numbers still being a fraction of those in 2016 when as many as 2,000 people a day were reportedly disembarking from boats. At least a third of the newcomers are unaccompanied minors, according to the UN refugee agency. \u201cIt has happened so quickly, aid organisations feel overwhelmed,\u201d said Sofia Malmqvist at the Athens branch of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \u201cThe situation is particularly acute on the islands. We are deeply concerned. There are a lot of children. What we are seeing is authorities [pursuing] short-term solutions such as moving some to the mainland and into tents, but what is going to happen in the winter?\u201d The influx comes amid mounting anti-refugee sentiment in Turkey on the back of the country\u2019s economic woes and growing unemployment. In recent weeks the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has repeatedly warned that his government will be forced to \u201copen the gates\u201d if the EU fails to deliver \u20ac6bn in promised funds \u2013 remuneration set out in the landmark accord \u2013 and Ankara is prevented from moving ahead with plans to create a safe zone in northern Syria where refugees could be relocated. Turkey currently hosts close to 4 million displaced Syrians with the prospect of that number escalating if yet more flee across the border from Idlib, the rebel stronghold that has become the focus of a renewed offensive by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and Damascus\u2019 backers in Moscow. As a result of the summer rise, Greece has overtaken Italy and Spain as the European Union\u2019s busiest entry point for illegal migration. In Athens, NGOs attribute the increase to the Turkish coastguard deliberately relaxing patrols. EU diplomats speak of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ability to hold the bloc to ransom by \u201copening and closing the faucet\u201d. Amid fears of a populist backlash, Germany, which took in more Syrian refugees than any other EU member state in 2015, has announced it is watching the illegal sea crossings with mounting concern. Like Greece\u2019s new centre-right government, Berlin sees a solution in greater numbers of asylum seekers being sent back to Turkey. The latest arrivals topped the agenda when Greece\u2019s foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, held talks in Berlin on Monday in which it was stressed it was vital that Ankara stick with the pact it has agreed with the EU. In almost four years since the EU-Turkey accord was reached, barely 1,000 have been returned \u2013 a reflection of the human rights concerns voiced by Athens\u2019 former leftist administration in deporting migrants back to Turkey. Under the agreement refugees have to process asylum claims on \u201centry point\u201d islands before being allowed to move on. In recent weeks Greek authorities have stepped up emergency evacuations, transferring some 1,800 people deemed to be vulnerable to camps on the mainland. \u201cBut,\u201d says McCann, \u201cthese cycles of emergency decongestion won\u2019t solve the underlining problems. This is a policy-driven crisis where the EU has sought to contain and externalise the problem [of migration] to the Greek isles. The EU-Turkey deal was supposed to be a \u2018temporary and extraordinary measure\u2019 to reduce flows and open safe legal alternatives to smugglers. Instead it has created camps where people are robbed of their dignity and forced to live in horrendous conditions.\u201d She said that in July and August, 73 children were referred to MSF\u2019s paediatric mental health teams in Lesbos: three had attempted to kill themselves and 17 had self-harmed. On all Aegean islands most affected by the influx, infrastructure is now at breaking point. Moria, the main reception centre in Lesbos, was so overcrowded last week there was no space to \u201ceven install more chemical toilets\u201d, the camp\u2019s exasperated governor, Yannis Balbakakis, lamented after unexpectedly announcing he was resigning from the post. The camp is currently home to 10,400 people although it was designed to host 3,000. The reception centre in Samos is even worse, \u201crunning seven times above capacity\u201d, noted Stella Nanou, the UN refugee agency\u2019s spokeswoman in Athens. \u201cThe increase in recent sea arrivals has put additional strain on already overcrowded facilities on the islands where conditions remain dire,\u201d she said. \u201cWith very few other official or legal pathways out of Greece the continued arrival of asylum seekers would entail the need for an ever-expanding reception capacity which is simply unsustainable. A longer-term plan is needed from the Greek authorities, with the support of the EU to define a [burden sharing] strategy to accommodate asylum seekers and refugees.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump, at a rally in New Mexico on Monday night, implied one of his supporters was too light-skinned to be Hispanic. The US president said of Steve Cortes, a member of his Hispanic advisory council: \u201cHe happens to be Hispanic, but I\u2019ve never quite figured it out, because he looks more like a Wasp than I do.\u201d Now a somewhat old-fashioned term, Wasp is an abbreviation for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. The president went on that there is nobody who \u201cloves his country more or Hispanics more\u201d than Cortes and, bizarrely, asked him which he prefers. Trump said: \u201cHe says the country. I don\u2019t know. I may have to go for the Hispanics, to be honest with you. We\u2019ve got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote.\u201d Cortes has been a longtime supporter of the president. This week he wrote an article for the Florida Daily headlined: President Trump Has Earned Hispanics\u2019 Trust. Trump added that Cortes had been sidelined from his role as a CNN political commentator because he was too positive about the president. \u201cYou were incredible on CNN, and now you\u2019ll get a real job, OK? Steve, that audience wasn\u2019t big enough for you. The ratings aren\u2019t good.\u201d Recent research by Priorities USA, a Democratic Super Pac campaign group, found Trump\u2019s standing with Latino voters sits at just 20% approval in Arizona and 26% in Nevada, though he fares better in Florida with a 42% approval rating. At Monday\u2019s rally in Rio Rancho, he delivered a rambling speech that lasted more than an hour and a half. \u201cTrump 2020\u201d, \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d, and \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d signs were sprinkled through the crowd. He made a pocketbook appeal for re-election in the Democratic-leaning state, telling voters that his energy policies had made the state wealthier and warning that the gains could disappear if the proposal known as the Green New Deal takes effect. \u201cThe Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico\u2019s economy,\u201d claimed Trump, who boasted that an oil and gas boom during his administration had helped increase the state\u2019s revenues. \u201cThe Democrats will never get the chance because New Mexico will never give them that chance.\u201d Trump went to New Mexico, which has not backed a Republican for president since 2004, to try to turn the state red and expand his grip on the electoral college in next year\u2019s presidential election. Trump\u2019s rally is the first stop on a three-day swing that will also take him to California for fundraisers expected to raise more than $15m. Trump has generally held his rallies in Republican-friendly terrain. Monday\u2019s rally represents a striking departure from that practice and demonstrates a campaign with the resources to try to turn a few Democratic-leaning states his way, similar to what happened in 2016 with Michigan and Wisconsin. Protesters, for their part, vowed to step up acts of civil disobedience and demonstrations.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has refused to rule out handing over a Sydney-based lawyer who advocates for West Papuans to Indonesian authorities. Veronica Koman, an Indonesian human rights lawyer who currently lives in Australia, is being pursued by Indonesian police for disseminating evidence of police- and military-backed violence in West Papua. Koman has been a credible source of eyewitness accounts, photos and footage of protests that have swept across West Papua and other Indonesian provinces in recent weeks. Several people have reportedly died and dozens of others injured in violent clashes with Indonesian police, military and military-backed militia, which were sparked by the racist abuse of Papuan students in Java but have morphed into a demand for a referendum on West Papuan independence. Koman faces charges under the country\u2019s controversial electronic information and transactions law, and faces up to six years in jail if found guilty. East Java police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera told the Guardian that if Koman did not report to Indonesian authorities by 18 September, a red notice would be issued through Interpol for her arrest. \u201cAfter that we will work with the international police,\u201d he said. When asked whether the Australian federal police would act on an Interpol red notice for the arrest of Koman, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was a matter for the AFP. A spokesperson for the AFP said: \u201cAny questions regarding this matter should be directed to Indonesian authorities.\u201d Koman said in a statement that there was a \u201csurprisingly wide [Indonesian] government campaign to pressure me into silence\u201d, including police intimidation of her family in Jakarta and threats to revoke her Indonesian passport and block her bank accounts. \u201cFor years, the Indonesian government has allocated more time and energy to waging a propaganda war than it has to investigating and ending human rights abuses in West Papua,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we are seeing a clear example of \u2018shoot the messenger\u2019 in the state\u2019s effort to persecute those, including me, who draw attention to abuses it is unwilling or unable to address.\u201d The Interpol \u201cred notice\u201d system \u2013 ostensibly used to \u201cseek the location and arrest of wanted persons wanted for prosecution or to serve a sentence\u201d \u2013 is regularly abused by authoritarian governments to pursue dissidents or political opponents who have left the country\u2019s territory. Globally, there are about 58,000 current valid red notices, of which only about 7,000 are public. Article 3 of Interpol\u2019s constitution forbids Interpol from undertaking \u201cany intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character\u201d. Indonesia issued a red notice for West Papuan independence leader Benny Wenda in 2011 but was forced to rescind it in 2012 after it was found to be politically motivated, and without genuine criminal basis. Australia has detained at least one person on the basis of a flawed red notice. Egypt issued a red notice for its national Sayed Abdellatif, who arrived in Australia by boat as an asylum seeker in 2012. A Guardian investigation revealed that several charges listed against his name had never been brought against him at his trial-in-absentia and that other convictions were based on evidence obtained \u201cunder severe torture\u201d. The Australian government had known for 18 months the red notice was invalid but had not acted to release him. Abdellatif\u2019s family members were released into community detention. But he remains in high security at Sydney\u2019s Villawood detention centre after more than seven years, despite recommendations from the United Nations human rights council that he be released and compensated for his \u201cclearly disproportionate \u2026 deprivation of liberty\u201d. Fair Trials took up Abdellatif\u2019s case, campaigning for the red notice to be withdrawn, and it was finally removed in 2018. On Monday, a group of UN human rights experts issued a statement calling on Indonesia to protect the rights of Koman and others reporting on the West Papua protests. \u201cWe call for immediate measures to ensure the protection of freedom of expression and address acts of harassment, intimidation, interference, undue restriction and threats against those reporting on the protests,\u201d the experts said.",

Asked on Monday whether he had pledged to protect Saudi Arabia, the president told reporters: \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t promised the Saudis that \u2026 We have to sit down with the Saudis and work something out.\u201d Later in the day, Trump stressed that if there were to be a retaliatory strike, Riyadh would have to play a leading role, especially when it came to paying for it. \u201cThe fact is the Saudis are going to have a lot of involvement in this, if we decide to do something,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThey\u2019ll be very much involved, and that includes payment. And they understand that fully.\u201d As to whether diplomacy with Iran had been exhausted, Trump said: \u201cNo, it\u2019s never exhausted \u2026 You never know what\u2019s going to happen \u2026 I know they want to make a deal \u2026 At some point it will work out.\u201d The Saudi military spokesman for the Riyadh-led coalition fighting in Yemen that Iranian-made weapons were used in the attack but stopped short of blaming Iran. \u201cThe investigation is continuing and all indications are that weapons used in both attacks came from Iran,\u201d Col Turki al-Maliki told reporters in Riyadh, according to the French press agency, AFP. He said the attacks had not been launched from Yemen and there was an investigation into \u201cfrom where they were fired\u201d. Iraqi officials said that Pompeo told them that the attack was not carried out from Iraqi soil and instead appeared to be launched from neighbouring Iran. Two aides to senior Iraqi leaders said Pompeo passed on to the claim in a phone call to the Iraqi prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, in the early hours of Monday. The call allayed mounting fears in Baghdad that an Iranian proxy force composed of Iraqis might have launched the drones believed to have carried out the devastating strike without the knowledge of the central government. But the Wall Street Journal quoted Saudi officials as saying their US counterparts had not provided enough evidence to conclude definitively that the attack was launched from Iran. On Monday, Trump stressed that it was Saudi Arabia not the US that had been attacked and played down the US national security interest in the Gulf, pointing to the fact that the US has become the world\u2019s biggest energy producer. \u201cWe don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil &amp; Gas, &amp; in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies!\u201d the president tweeted. A senior White House official \u2013 the vice-president\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short \u2013 argued that when the president had said the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d, it was a reference to the country\u2019s self sufficiency in energy. \u201cI think that \u2018locked and loaded\u2019 is a broad term and talks about the realities that we\u2019re all far safer and more secure domestically from energy independence,\u201d Short said. The remarks seemed to be aimed at keeping the president\u2019s options open on a response to the attack, which knocked out half Saudi production, 5% of global production and triggered a spike in oil prices. But the administration also showed determination that the world held Iran responsible. Like Pompeo, who accused Iran of responsibility for the attack on Saturday, the US energy secretary, Rick Perry, left no room for doubt about culpability. \u201cThe United States wholeheartedly condemns Iran\u2019s attacks on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and we call on other nations to do the same,\u201d Perry said during a trip to Vienna. Asked on CNBC what the response should be, Perry said: \u201cI think there will be a coalition effort, both our friends in the Middle East that understand having a crazy neighbor is a real problem \u2026 [and] all those countries in that region should have the hair on the back of their necks standing up watching a country attack someone to manipulate the energy market.\u201d The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, tweeted on Monday: Speaking to the UN security council, Britain\u2019s ambassador, Karen Pierce, said: \u201cWe are still assessing what happened and who is responsible for these attacks. Once this has been established, we will discuss with our allies and partners how to proceed in a responsible manner. We need a united international response to these despicable attacks.\u201d Additional reporting by Mohammed Rasool",

      "bodyText": "On Monday Canberra enjoyed a balmy 25C day. On Tuesday it snowed. Surprised residents of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory woke up on Tuesday morning to find up to 15 centimetres of snow had fallen in some regions, directly after one of the warmest days yet of spring. The snow blanketed places such as Goulburn and Tarago in NSW, the tops of Mount Ainslie and Mount Majura in Canberra, and even fell directly outside Parliament House. Snow closed parts of the Hume Highway on Tuesday morning and the extreme temperature variation left many Canberrans puzzled. Abrar Shabren, a forecaster for the Bureau of Meteorology, said the snowfall had been caused by a cold front that moved in from the west overnight. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cCold fronts do tend to at this time in the year produce a level of snow,\u201d he said.

The front will then move into NSW where it will create rain along the coastal fringe, and the bureau has issued a flood warning for the Myall, Paterson and Williams rivers and Tuggerah Lake. Shabren said Canberra could see more snow above 800m for the rest of the day but it was unlikely for Wednesday.

The government argues the card, which stores up to 80% of a welfare recipient\u2019s payment for use at selected stores, leads to a reduction in violence and harm related to drinking alcohol, illegal drug use and gambling. But it has been criticised for punishing people who have had a good track record managing their money, and making it harder for them to manage their daily lives. Individuals are able to apply to be exempted from the card where the Department of Social Security is satisfied that \u201cbeing on the cashless debit card is affecting their mental, physical or emotional wellbeing\u201d. However, questions have been asked about the transparency of the exemption process. Raylene Peel, 54, lives in Boulder in the Goldfields region of Western Australia.

The series, a co-commission between Australia\u2019s ABC TV and Sky, follows the tribulations of a wealthy London housewife, Sammy Cooper, who, after the sudden death of her husband, is forced to return to her home town of Newcastle, New South Wales, in 1989.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/06/neighbours-goes-back-to-school-in-spin-off-miniseries-erinsborough-high\">Neighbours goes back to school in spin-off miniseries Erinsborough High</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Written by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/09/sarah-kendall-funniest-thing\">award-winning Australian comedian Sarah Kendall</a>, who also plays the part of Sammy, Frayed aims for laughs.
