The dramatic move on Thursday came after months of fighting between the League and its coalition partners, the anti-establishement Five Star Movement (M5S).

The energy and \u201cemissions reduction\u201d minister who has presided over steadily increasing greenhouse gas emissions announced the review on Friday, a week after AGL revealed it would extend the life of Liddell from 2022 to April 2023. Taylor told ABC News Breakfast the taskforce was made possible by the \u201cvery collaborative\u201d approach of the New South Wales government. It would consider \u201ceverything from extension to replacement with like-for-like capacity\u201d, arguing Australia did not want a repeat of power price rises and blackouts after the Hazelwood coal station in Victoria was decommissioned. Asked if this could include taxpayer funding, Taylor at first said \u201cno\u201d before qualifying that \u201call options are on the table\u201d and repeatedly refusing to rule it out. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have all options on the table and I\u2019m not going to front-run the conclusion of this taskforce,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is we get a solution as quickly as possible.

After the Morrison government was re-elected in May, the Coalition set up an inquiry into nuclear power after calls from several backbenchers to consider the controversial means to provide baseload power. The former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, weighed into the debate on Tuesday saying renewables combined with storage was \u201cthe cheapest form of new generation \u2026 cheaper than new coal and far cheaper than nuclear\u201d. Turnbull\u2019s energy minister in the 45th parliament, Josh Frydenberg, failed to persuade AGL to keep Liddell open, leading to a chorus of outrage from Coalition MPs including Craig Kelly who called for options including nationalising the plant and the government building coal-fired power plants. The coal baron Trevor St Baker has signalled an interest in redeveloping Liddell but claims he has not sought taxpayer support for the idea. In March Taylor confirmed the Morrison government was continuing to assess new coal power projects as part of its underwriting scheme to fund new power generation despite pushback from moderate Liberals. Last week the NSW energy and environment minister, Matt Kean, said he was \u201cpleased to see AGL doing the right thing by the people of NSW by delaying the closure\u201d of the plant. Kean said he was focused on long-term solutions to introduce new electricity supply into the market and called on companies to \u201cdeliver more dispatchable generation that drives down prices and ensures reliability into the future\u201d.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1) A flurry of attacking full-backs at Anfield</strong></h2> <p>While there is plenty of excitement to be drawn from Liverpool\u2019s much-lauded front three, a good argument could be made that the two most thrilling players in J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side are defenders. Technically, anyway. In reality, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson spent last season making a mockery of their job descriptions, zooming forward with exuberant abandon and each laying on more goals than any of the side\u2019s so-called attackers. Meanwhile, down in the Championship, a similar operation was in progress. Norwich\u2019s full-back duo, Jamal Lewis and Max Aarons, are under strict instructions from Daniel Farke to play with the handbrake permanently off and duly raised pulses at Carrow Road, clocking up 10 assists between them with Lewis being named the EFL young player of the season. In theory, that could spell good news for Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mo Salah on Friday night: Liverpool\u2019s chief goal threats should not be short of vacant space to exploit on their respective flanks. But either way, with so many tireless shuttlers on show, proceedings at Anfield may look less like a football match than an Olympic swimming contest. <strong>AH</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/graham-potter-dean-smith-chris-wilder-premier-league-managers\">Enter English managers to show their worth and cause Premier League surprise</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) <strong>Hammers can make a statement against champions</strong></h2> <p>Manuel Pellegrini: a quietly dignified purveyor of easy-on-the-eye football and unheralded soother of post-relocation turbulence, or a crusty charisma vacuum happy to sit back and collect a late-career paycheck? West Ham: a youthfully promising attacking outfit that could trouble the top six, or a pick-and-mix squad stocked with and managed by journeymen, fated for a late-season dogfight they don\u2019t have the mettle for? A year into Pellegrini\u2019s reign in east London, both questions remain strangely unanswered, though Saturday\u2019s lunchtime kick-off may give us a better idea of what lies ahead. Because while the visit of the champions may be read as a \u201cfree hit\u201d for West Ham in terms of the result, the manner of their performance will speak volumes: a meek surrender will confirm the worst fears of an angsty home crowd and remind the world that Pellegrini\u2019s biggest job in England was as a placeholder for Pep Guardiola. A bolshy, in-your-face display, however \u2013 maybe even a goal or two \u2013 would send a much-needed message that last season\u2019s top-half finish is there to be built on. With a small army of silky playmakers, one of the country\u2019s best young players in Declan Rice and a shiny new \u00a345m goalscorer in S\u00e9bastien Haller, Pellegrini has a squad of undoubted talent. He also has plenty of naysayers. Making good use of the former would make fools of the latter. <strong>AH</strong></p> <h2>3 ) A potential best-of-the-rest treat at the King Power?</h2> <p>With Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester United looking vulnerable, the teams below them will feel that they have a chance to penetrate the fabled battle for the top four<sup>TM</sup>. Wolves and Leicester both look decently equipped for the task, with settled sides, exciting individuals and canny managers. Last season, both sides acquitted themselves well against the teams who finished above them, and there is no reason to think that should change; but what does need to change is their performances when they\u2019re expected to win. Leicester lost home games to Cardiff, Crystal Palace and Newcastle, while Wolves were beaten by Palace, Cardiff, and Huddersfield twice. Also important is the momentum of a good start, and the fixtures computer has ensured that this will be difficult for both; Leicester play Chelsea second, while Wolves meet Manchester United. But first of all they must struggle with one another in what promises to be a fascinating match-up: Leicester look to move the ball quickly, attacking at pace and in numbers, while Wolves play a slower, possession-based style, probing for holes before exploding. Each is well equipped to punish the weaknesses of the other, which is to say that Sunday\u2019s match makes for one of the best of the weekend. <strong>DH</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/jesus-vallejo-george-hirst-10-astute-premier-league-signings-this-summer\">From Jes\u00fas Vallejo to George Hirst: 10 astute Premier League summer buys</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46caca4927081d9b6dd0435a316b5da6c4f4e80a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46caca4927081d9b6dd0435a316b5da6c4f4e80a/604_355_4329_2598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brendan Rodgers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team will hope to impose their quick game on the more defensive Wolves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Welbeck can reassert talents at Watford</h2> <p>There are certain players who look to have pretty much every attribute required to be a top player \u2026 except for the one intangible thing that makes top players top players, and Danny Welbeck is one. He has a lovely touch, an engaging imagination, work ethic, pace and physical presence, but struggles to put it all together often enough to wring the most from his talent. At 28 years old, he still has time \u2013 just \u2013 and at Watford should get the chance to play through the middle regularly. Though his reputation is as a bad finisher, unreliable is a more accurate description \u2013 he can make difficult chances look easy, just as he can make easy chances look difficult. If he can only compose in front of goal, and if injuries can only leave him in peace, he could be an excellent addition to an already useful Watford side. <strong>DH</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>5) Zaha to be taken out of the Selhurst firing line?</strong></h2> <p>Slapping in a transfer request the day before the window closes is a high stakes game to play, and Wilfried Zaha must now pay the consequences of losing his fight to leave Crystal Palace. That Saturday\u2019s opponent is the very club he pushed to join only compounds the discomfort. It seems likely that Roy Hodgson will take his star player out of the firing line having sent Zaha home from training on Thursday as the winger\u2019s hope of an exit turned to dust. \u201cWhen you sign long-term contracts you are expected to honour them and we expect him to do that,\u201d Hodgson said as the deal collapsed, and pointedly. Should Zaha be at Selhurst in the capacity of player or spectator, he can see what he might have been part of. Everton have been busy in the market, with Alex Iwobi the final signing of a raft of additions of whom Moise Kean most captures the imagination. <strong>JB</strong><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/ryan-sessegnon-set-to-join-tottenham-from-fulham-for-initial-25m\">Tottenham sign Sessegnon and Lo Celso but miss out on Dybala</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><br>6) A happy homecoming for Rodriguez?</h2> <p>Jay Rodriguez is back at his hometown club and poised to make his first Premier League appearance for Burnley on Saturday. The 30-year-old had a productive spell for West Brom and merits another shot at the big time, and he rejoins a club in a reasonably buoyant mood after a strong finish to a hitherto underwhelming 2018-19 season. Rodriguez\u2019s two-goal display in a friendly win over Parma last weekend bodes well for the Clarets. How Rodriguez fits into an attacking unit that has been spearheaded by the settled pairing of Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes will be one point of tactical intrigue. The loan signing of 2016\u2019s Danny Drinkwater is another interesting addition. Southampton should arrive at Turf Moor in good spirits too. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has generally coaxed brighter, sparkier performances from Saints since his arrival last December, and has recruited well over the summer. Arrivals such as Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo promise much and they, like their opponents on Saturday, can go into their season-opener with legitimate aspirations of a top-half finish. <strong>TD</strong></p> <h2><strong><br>7) No Dybala but there is fresh blood for Pochettino</strong></h2> <p>In the first Saturday evening serving of the Premier League, transfer deadline day\u2019s headline makers in Tottenham welcome the entire window\u2019s most active operators in Aston Villa. Minds may still fixate on those who did not arrive or did not get their wish to leave. Paulo Dybala will not, after all, be unveiled on the pitch and get to test out the Tottenham Stadium\u2019s unrivalled executive facilities. Instead, Spurs fans can satisfy themselves with first glimpses of Giovani Lo Celso, Ryan Sessegnon, and Tanguy Ndombele. Meanwhile, the likes of Danny Rose, Christian Eriksen and Toby Alderweireld remain Tottenham players, barring continental escapes with the European window open until the end of the month; Eriksen had his heart especially set on leaving. Mauricio Pochettino has the new blood he was agitating for but still appears well short of the resources to challenge Manchester City or Liverpool. For Villa, though, who signed 13 players this summer, Spurs still represent a supreme test for a freshly promoted club. <strong>JB<br></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/manchester-city-leroy-sane-facing-injury-lay-off-knee-surgery\">Manchester City\u2019s Leroy San\u00e9 facing long spell on sidelines with knee injury</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c18ee3d27552274d98e36ffd184e3210b0856bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c18ee3d27552274d98e36ffd184e3210b0856bf/0_96_1994_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Eriksen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Eriksen has not yet managed to find his way to the Tottenham exit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Shopland/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8) Can Newcastle catch new-look Arsenal cold?</h2> <p>Is this the real beginning of Arsenal\u2019s new era? Their summer activity would suggest it and, at the least, the feeling around Unai Emery\u2019s squad is significantly fresher than the drab bunch he inherited 12 months ago. St James\u2019 Park does not seem similarly awash with the joys of late summer so this should be a good opportunity to put those good vibes to the test. If Andy Carroll is paraded in front of the Newcastle fans then local spirits might be raised a touch and the \u00a340m signing Joelinton will fancy a crack at Arsenal\u2019s defence on his competitive debut. Steve Bruce could do with a good start and if the Magpies are grasping for omens then they could cast their minds back to the last time these clubs faced off on the opening day, in 2011. Back then Gervinho was sent off on his Arsenal debut; by coincidence another Ivorian winger, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, should make his bow at the same venue and at the very least Bruce will need to keep the prolific attacker quiet. <strong>NA</strong><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/newcastle-andy-carroll-steve-bruce-local-hero\">Steve Bruce relishes having \u2018local hero\u2019 Andy Carroll back at Newcastle</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><br>9) De Gea has amends to make against Chelsea</h2> <p>Manchester United\u2019s draw at home to Chelsea in April was the nadir of a difficult season for David de Gea, whose mistake gave Marcos Alonso the equaliser. It was the culmination of the toughest spell of de Gea\u2019s career, and at the end of the season he lost his place in the Spain team to Chelsea\u2019s Kepa. If Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is to improve Manchester United this season, he needs De Gea in the kind of form that makes pundits swoon. It was almost certainly a blip, the kind all keepers experience, but Sunday\u2019s match against Chelsea at Old Trafford will give us an insight into De Gea\u2019s confidence levels \u2013 and the first clue as to whether DDG is still Dead Dead Good, or whether, given the memories of April\u2019s meeting, and the presence of Kepa in the opposition goal, he will not struggle for motivation. <strong>RS</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76533ac670f34e903b32682daa7a6cf6969d95da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76533ac670f34e903b32682daa7a6cf6969d95da/157_284_2671_1603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David de Ge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David de Gea made this catastrophic error when Chelsea last visited Old Trafford</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10) Mousset given instant chance to prove Bournemouth wrong</h2> <p>Saturday will be a strange day for Lys Mousset. He will go to the Vitality Stadium as usual but this time he will walk into the away dressing room with his new club Sheffield United. It will be an equally odd sensation if, at 3pm, he walks on to the field rather than towards the dugout. Mousset was a regular substitute at Bournemouth, and the last time he started a Premier League game at the Vitality Stadium was March 2018. It never quite worked out on the South Coast, in part because of the excellence of Callum Wilson and Josh King. But Mousset has oodles of potential, and most of the raw materials any striker would want. And, like his new club, he has the opportunity to prove people wrong this season. If Sheffield United are to confound snooty assumptions and avoid relegation, Mousset could play a big part. <strong>RS</strong><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "1) A flurry of attacking full-backs at Anfield While there is plenty of excitement to be drawn from Liverpool\u2019s much-lauded front three, a good argument could be made that the two most thrilling players in J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side are defenders. Technically, anyway. In reality, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson spent last season making a mockery of their job descriptions, zooming forward with exuberant abandon and each laying on more goals than any of the side\u2019s so-called attackers. Meanwhile, down in the Championship, a similar operation was in progress. Norwich\u2019s full-back duo, Jamal Lewis and Max Aarons, are under strict instructions from Daniel Farke to play with the handbrake permanently off and duly raised pulses at Carrow Road, clocking up 10 assists between them with Lewis being named the EFL young player of the season. In theory, that could spell good news for Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mo Salah on Friday night: Liverpool\u2019s chief goal threats should not be short of vacant space to exploit on their respective flanks. But either way, with so many tireless shuttlers on show, proceedings at Anfield may look less like a football match than an Olympic swimming contest. AH 2) Hammers can make a statement against champions Manuel Pellegrini: a quietly dignified purveyor of easy-on-the-eye football and unheralded soother of post-relocation turbulence, or a crusty charisma vacuum happy to sit back and collect a late-career paycheck? West Ham: a youthfully promising attacking outfit that could trouble the top six, or a pick-and-mix squad stocked with and managed by journeymen, fated for a late-season dogfight they don\u2019t have the mettle for? A year into Pellegrini\u2019s reign in east London, both questions remain strangely unanswered, though Saturday\u2019s lunchtime kick-off may give us a better idea of what lies ahead. Because while the visit of the champions may be read as a \u201cfree hit\u201d for West Ham in terms of the result, the manner of their performance will speak volumes: a meek surrender will confirm the worst fears of an angsty home crowd and remind the world that Pellegrini\u2019s biggest job in England was as a placeholder for Pep Guardiola. A bolshy, in-your-face display, however \u2013 maybe even a goal or two \u2013 would send a much-needed message that last season\u2019s top-half finish is there to be built on. With a small army of silky playmakers, one of the country\u2019s best young players in Declan Rice and a shiny new \u00a345m goalscorer in S\u00e9bastien Haller, Pellegrini has a squad of undoubted talent. He also has plenty of naysayers. Making good use of the former would make fools of the latter. AH 3 ) A potential best-of-the-rest treat at the King Power? With Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester United looking vulnerable, the teams below them will feel that they have a chance to penetrate the fabled battle for the top fourTM. Wolves and Leicester both look decently equipped for the task, with settled sides, exciting individuals and canny managers. Last season, both sides acquitted themselves well against the teams who finished above them, and there is no reason to think that should change; but what does need to change is their performances when they\u2019re expected to win. Leicester lost home games to Cardiff, Crystal Palace and Newcastle, while Wolves were beaten by Palace, Cardiff, and Huddersfield twice. Also important is the momentum of a good start, and the fixtures computer has ensured that this will be difficult for both; Leicester play Chelsea second, while Wolves meet Manchester United. But first of all they must struggle with one another in what promises to be a fascinating match-up: Leicester look to move the ball quickly, attacking at pace and in numbers, while Wolves play a slower, possession-based style, probing for holes before exploding. Each is well equipped to punish the weaknesses of the other, which is to say that Sunday\u2019s match makes for one of the best of the weekend. DH 4) Welbeck can reassert talents at Watford There are certain players who look to have pretty much every attribute required to be a top player \u2026 except for the one intangible thing that makes top players top players, and Danny Welbeck is one. He has a lovely touch, an engaging imagination, work ethic, pace and physical presence, but struggles to put it all together often enough to wring the most from his talent. At 28 years old, he still has time \u2013 just \u2013 and at Watford should get the chance to play through the middle regularly. Though his reputation is as a bad finisher, unreliable is a more accurate description \u2013 he can make difficult chances look easy, just as he can make easy chances look difficult. If he can only compose in front of goal, and if injuries can only leave him in peace, he could be an excellent addition to an already useful Watford side. DH 5) Zaha to be taken out of the Selhurst firing line? Slapping in a transfer request the day before the window closes is a high stakes game to play, and Wilfried Zaha must now pay the consequences of losing his fight to leave Crystal Palace. That Saturday\u2019s opponent is the very club he pushed to join only compounds the discomfort. It seems likely that Roy Hodgson will take his star player out of the firing line having sent Zaha home from training on Thursday as the winger\u2019s hope of an exit turned to dust. \u201cWhen you sign long-term contracts you are expected to honour them and we expect him to do that,\u201d Hodgson said as the deal collapsed, and pointedly. Should Zaha be at Selhurst in the capacity of player or spectator, he can see what he might have been part of. Everton have been busy in the market, with Alex Iwobi the final signing of a raft of additions of whom Moise Kean most captures the imagination. JB 6) A happy homecoming for Rodriguez? Jay Rodriguez is back at his hometown club and poised to make his first Premier League appearance for Burnley on Saturday. The 30-year-old had a productive spell for West Brom and merits another shot at the big time, and he rejoins a club in a reasonably buoyant mood after a strong finish to a hitherto underwhelming 2018-19 season. Rodriguez\u2019s two-goal display in a friendly win over Parma last weekend bodes well for the Clarets. How Rodriguez fits into an attacking unit that has been spearheaded by the settled pairing of Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes will be one point of tactical intrigue. The loan signing of 2016\u2019s Danny Drinkwater is another interesting addition. Southampton should arrive at Turf Moor in good spirits too. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has generally coaxed brighter, sparkier performances from Saints since his arrival last December, and has recruited well over the summer. Arrivals such as Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo promise much and they, like their opponents on Saturday, can go into their season-opener with legitimate aspirations of a top-half finish. TD 7) No Dybala but there is fresh blood for Pochettino In the first Saturday evening serving of the Premier League, transfer deadline day\u2019s headline makers in Tottenham welcome the entire window\u2019s most active operators in Aston Villa. Minds may still fixate on those who did not arrive or did not get their wish to leave. Paulo Dybala will not, after all, be unveiled on the pitch and get to test out the Tottenham Stadium\u2019s unrivalled executive facilities. Instead, Spurs fans can satisfy themselves with first glimpses of Giovani Lo Celso, Ryan Sessegnon, and Tanguy Ndombele. Meanwhile, the likes of Danny Rose, Christian Eriksen and Toby Alderweireld remain Tottenham players, barring continental escapes with the European window open until the end of the month; Eriksen had his heart especially set on leaving. Mauricio Pochettino has the new blood he was agitating for but still appears well short of the resources to challenge Manchester City or Liverpool. For Villa, though, who signed 13 players this summer, Spurs still represent a supreme test for a freshly promoted club. JB 8) Can Newcastle catch new-look Arsenal cold? Is this the real beginning of Arsenal\u2019s new era? Their summer activity would suggest it and, at the least, the feeling around Unai Emery\u2019s squad is significantly fresher than the drab bunch he inherited 12 months ago. St James\u2019 Park does not seem similarly awash with the joys of late summer so this should be a good opportunity to put those good vibes to the test. If Andy Carroll is paraded in front of the Newcastle fans then local spirits might be raised a touch and the \u00a340m signing Joelinton will fancy a crack at Arsenal\u2019s defence on his competitive debut. Steve Bruce could do with a good start and if the Magpies are grasping for omens then they could cast their minds back to the last time these clubs faced off on the opening day, in 2011. Back then Gervinho was sent off on his Arsenal debut; by coincidence another Ivorian winger, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, should make his bow at the same venue and at the very least Bruce will need to keep the prolific attacker quiet. NA 9) De Gea has amends to make against Chelsea Manchester United\u2019s draw at home to Chelsea in April was the nadir of a difficult season for David de Gea, whose mistake gave Marcos Alonso the equaliser. It was the culmination of the toughest spell of de Gea\u2019s career, and at the end of the season he lost his place in the Spain team to Chelsea\u2019s Kepa. If Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is to improve Manchester United this season, he needs De Gea in the kind of form that makes pundits swoon. It was almost certainly a blip, the kind all keepers experience, but Sunday\u2019s match against Chelsea at Old Trafford will give us an insight into De Gea\u2019s confidence levels \u2013 and the first clue as to whether DDG is still Dead Dead Good, or whether, given the memories of April\u2019s meeting, and the presence of Kepa in the opposition goal, he will not struggle for motivation. RS 10) Mousset given instant chance to prove Bournemouth wrong Saturday will be a strange day for Lys Mousset. He will go to the Vitality Stadium as usual but this time he will walk into the away dressing room with his new club Sheffield United. It will be an equally odd sensation if, at 3pm, he walks on to the field rather than towards the dugout. Mousset was a regular substitute at Bournemouth, and the last time he started a Premier League game at the Vitality Stadium was March 2018. It never quite worked out on the South Coast, in part because of the excellence of Callum Wilson and Josh King. But Mousset has oodles of potential, and most of the raw materials any striker would want. And, like his new club, he has the opportunity to prove people wrong this season. If Sheffield United are to confound snooty assumptions and avoid relegation, Mousset could play a big part. RS",

It\u2019s so easy to splash out when you have cash, and then regret it when things get tight.

I\u2019ve also made some lump sum payments into super when I\u2019ve been able to in the past few years. Now that I\u2019m over 55, retirement doesn\u2019t seem that far away so putting extra funds into super doesn\u2019t feel like such an incredibly long-term investment anymore. When I started out I couldn\u2019t really afford to pay myself super for a while, and when work began to flow steadily I often didn\u2019t, so it really stalled for a while. I paid in a bit here and there, always planning to catch up later, so my balance stayed pretty static for a few years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/caresuper-staying-future-focused/2019/jul/24/moving-targets-the-art-of-navigating-a-fluid-professional-landscape\">Moving targets: The art of navigating a fluid professional landscape</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hill says the biggest lesson she\u2019s learned through life as a freelancer is to include the additional nine per cent in her service fee \u2013 that way contributing to super doesn\u2019t feel like such a drain on funds. \u201cYou tend not to think of your fee as including super, so in a way you\u2019re under-charging by roughly nine per cent all the time.

When you feel unmotivated, it\u2019s easy to be distracted and go for a walk or find some vital household job that has to be done today - and probably involves a trip to the shops, a coffee while you\u2019re out, and catching up with your reading afterwards.\u201d Networking can be difficult and time-consuming. When you feel unmotivated, it\u2019s easy to be distracted. As with any small business, cash flow can become tricky for anyone earning their living through freelance work. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to plan and save, especially as my partner and I are both self-employed. It\u2019s so easy to splash out when you have cash, and then regret it when things get tight. It\u2019s hard to plan things like travel and holidays, because you always worry that work might drop off, or you\u2019ll get so busy that you won\u2019t be able to take time off when you want to.\u201d While Hill jokes there are more fun ways to spend her money, she\u2019s also renewed her focus on superannuation, particularly as she approaches potential retirement. \u201cI try to save as much as I can when I can, and I keep some of it in a term deposit so that I can\u2019t spend it on a whim. I\u2019ve also made some lump sum payments into super when I\u2019ve been able to in the past few years. Now that I\u2019m over 55, retirement doesn\u2019t seem that far away so putting extra funds into super doesn\u2019t feel like such an incredibly long-term investment anymore. When I started out I couldn\u2019t really afford to pay myself super for a while, and when work began to flow steadily I often didn\u2019t, so it really stalled for a while. I paid in a bit here and there, always planning to catch up later, so my balance stayed pretty static for a few years.\u201d Hill says the biggest lesson she\u2019s learned through life as a freelancer is to include the additional nine per cent in her service fee \u2013 that way contributing to super doesn\u2019t feel like such a drain on funds. \u201cYou tend not to think of your fee as including super, so in a way you\u2019re under-charging by roughly nine per cent all the time. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but it adds up,\u201d she says, adding in that you\u2019re missing out on the investment returns and compounding interest, too. It\u2019s hard to take that nine per cent and put it aside, whereas when you\u2019re employed it just gets done for you and you don\u2019t think about it because you don\u2019t see it.\u201d According to Hill, it all comes down to discipline in the end. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to put it off until that next \u2018big fee\u2019 comes in. Looking back, I wish I\u2019d been really disciplined about contributing even five per cent of every single invoice that was paid as soon as I got the money.\u201d According to Hill, it all comes down to discipline in the end. To make the most of what she does have, Hill has chosen an industry fund and transferred all of her existing super into it. \u201cI keep an eye on how my funds are invested and make sure I choose funds that give growth but don\u2019t have too much risk attached, as at my age I can\u2019t afford to make a big loss.\u201d Hill\u2019s approach is just one of many, and individuals should always consult a financial specialist for tailored advice. However, her final piece of advice is universal. \u201cMy biggest tip is to be absolutely disciplined about contributing regularly,\u201d she says. \u201cYou feel like retirement is a lifetime away, but believe me it isn\u2019t. You\u2019ll be much more secure and happy if you get to 60 and your super balance is looking good than you would be with a new pair of shoes or buying your lunches every day.\u201d Disclaimer: the opinions included within the article are those of the interviewees and not the opinion or advice of CareSuper.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of schoolchildren have been drafted in to make Amazon\u2019s Alexa devices in China as part of a controversial and often illegal attempt to meet production targets, documents seen by the Guardian reveal. Interviews with workers and leaked documents from Amazon\u2019s supplier Foxconn show that many of the children have been required to work nights and overtime to produce the smart-speaker devices, in breach of Chinese labour laws. According to the documents, the teenagers \u2013 drafted in from schools and technical colleges in and around the central southern city of Hengyang \u2013 are classified as \u201cinterns\u201d, and their teachers are paid by the factory to accompany them. Teachers are asked to encourage uncooperative pupils to accept overtime work on top of regular shifts. Some of the pupils making Amazon\u2019s Alexa-enabled Echo and Echo Dot devices along with Kindles have been required to work for more than two months to supplement staffing levels at the factory during peak production periods, researchers found. More than 1,000 pupils are employed, aged from 16 to 18. Chinese factories are allowed to employ students aged 16 and older, but these schoolchildren are not allowed to work nights or overtime. Foxconn, which also makes iPhones for Apple, admitted that students had been employed illegally and said it was taking immediate action to fix the situation. The company said in a statement: \u201cWe have doubled the oversight and monitoring of the internship program with each relevant partner school to ensure that, under no circumstances, will interns [be] allowed to work overtime or nights. \u201cThere have been instances in the past where lax oversight on the part of the local management team has allowed this to happen and, while the impacted interns were paid the additional wages associated with these shifts, this is not acceptable and we have taken immediate steps to ensure it will not be repeated.\u201d The company defended its use of schoolchildren, however, claiming that \u201cit provides students, who are all of a legal working age, with the opportunity to gain practical work experience and on-the-job training in a number of areas that will support their efforts to find employment following their graduation.\u201d Foxconn said it would increase the number of regular workers and review salaries immediately. A spokesperson for Amazon, which is headed by Jeff Bezos, the richest person in the world with a fortune estimated at more than $100bn, said the company would not tolerate violations of its supplier code of conduct and regularly assessed suppliers, often using independent auditors, to monitor compliance and improvement. \u201cIf we find violations, we take appropriate steps, including requesting immediate corrective action,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cWe are urgently investigating these allegations and addressing this with Foxconn at the most senior level. Additional teams of specialists arrived on-site yesterday to investigate, and we\u2019ve initiated weekly audits of this issue.\u201d Teenagers who spoke to researchers said the factory work has no relevance to their courses and they have been pressed into working overtime. Xiao Fang*, 17, started work at the factory on the Amazon Echo production line last month. Fang, who is studying computing, was given the task of applying a protective film to about 3,000 Echo Dots each day.

      "body": "<p>If there is one quality that links Graham Potter, Dean Smith and Chris Wilder, it is a willingness to accept a tough challenge. They have made it to the top after coming from humble beginnings \u2013 Potter with \u00d6stersund in the fourth tier of Swedish football, Wilder at non-league Alfreton, Smith by falling into the Walsall job by accident \u2013 and this season they have a chance to alter perceptions about the worth of English managers.</p> <p>It will not be easy for this trio of home-grown coaches, none of whom has managed in the Premier League. Potter faces a tough task to remodel Brighton\u2019s style after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/18/graham-potter-to-leave-swansea-for-brighton-manager-job\" title=\"\">replacing Chris Hughton</a>, Smith\u2019s Aston Villa must focus on survival after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/27/aston-villa-derby-county-championship-playoff-final-match-report\" title=\"\">winning the Championship play-off final</a> and Wilder needs to perform his latest miracle after taking Sheffield United from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/01/premier-league-chris-wilder-sheffield-united\" title=\"\">League One to the top flight</a>.</p> <p>Yet it is lazy to assume all three will fail because of an apparent lack of glamour. When Smith arrived at Villa Park last October some saw stints at Brentford and Walsall on his CV and doubted if he was the man to get Villa promoted. Yet Dan Mole, Walsall\u2019s club secretary, knew better. \u201cThey\u2019re going on the name, not the man,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s lived his life in football. He\u2019s organised, disciplined and has a plan.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/graham-potter-brighton-manager-dalai-lama-interview\">Graham Potter: \u2018The Dalai Lama is quite a clever guy, isn\u2019t he?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Similarly Bobo Sollander, who played for Potter at \u00d6stersund and saw how he lifted an obscure club from the backwaters of Swedish football to the Europa League in the space of seven years, believes his old manager will be managing in the Champions League soon. \u201cI don\u2019t think his journey will be done with Brighton,\u201d Sollander says. \u201cHe is going to be a top-four coach in a couple of years. He is that good.\u201d</p> <p>English managers have often been written off as long-ball dinosaurs in recent years and tearing off that label can be hard. Yet every aspiring coach needs a break and for Wilder an opportunity arrived when he was in the twilight of his playing career at Alfreton in 2001. \u201cChris\u2019s enthusiasm was boundless,\u201d Wayne Bradley, Alfreton\u2019s chairman, says. \u201cHe had no experience but as much energy that you\u2019d ever want to come across. He wanted to get involved in everything \u2013 from what kit we played in to how we prepared for games.\u201d</p> <p>Wilder, 51, has taken a winding path since winning the quadruple inside 27 weeks with Alfreton. He moved to Halifax in 2002, had a brief stint as No 2 to his current assistant Alan Knill at Bury, took Oxford into the Football League in 2010, won League Two with Northampton in 2016 and has had a stunning impact since moving to Bramall Lane.</p> <p>There have also been hard times. He faced financial difficulties at Halifax and Northampton. Yet Joel Byrom, who played for Wilder at Northampton, remembers that spirits were always high. \u201cIf you produced for him at the weekend, he\u2019d give you a day off,\u201d he says. \u201cWe still have a group chat from that team. I still go away with some of the lads in the summer. You don\u2019t have that normally.\u201d</p> <p>Astute man-management is crucial: it helped Potter settle when the 44-year-old joined \u00d6stersund in 2010. \u201cIt was the way he said his door would always be open for you,\u201d Sollander says. \u201cIt always felt like if you needed to talk with him you could. He was easier to access than coaches I had before. When training was over they went home. Graham stayed and worked. There was always something new to think about.\u201d</p> <p>In Smith\u2019s case he is remembered at Walsall as a studious coach and a man who commanded respect. The 48-year-old started as the club\u2019s head of academy and has previously said he had no ambitions to become a manager. He fell into the job only when Walsall, battling against relegation from League One, sacked Chris Hutchings in January 2011.</p> <p>It turned out to be an inspired appointment. Smith kept Walsall up and had developed a reputation as one of the Football League\u2019s most progressive coaches by the time he joined Brentford in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Dean came in at the academy it did feel like that was where he\u2019d see his short-term career,\u201d Mole says. \u201cBut when we moved the manager on, Dean was probably the only one qualified to take the team. If it wasn\u2019t Dean, it was either me or the chief executive. Somehow he managed the great escape. From there he helped build a structure which saw us pushing for promotion in the season he left.</p> <p>\u201cHe has human qualities that sometimes get lost in football. Did I think he\u2019d end up in the Premier League? It\u2019s impossible to say. All I know is he is the best manager I have worked with. He\u2019s true to his philosophy and gets a buy-in from every element of a club.\u201d</p> <p>There are hard sides to these coaches, though.

      "bodyText": "If there is one quality that links Graham Potter, Dean Smith and Chris Wilder, it is a willingness to accept a tough challenge. They have made it to the top after coming from humble beginnings \u2013 Potter with \u00d6stersund in the fourth tier of Swedish football, Wilder at non-league Alfreton, Smith by falling into the Walsall job by accident \u2013 and this season they have a chance to alter perceptions about the worth of English managers. It will not be easy for this trio of home-grown coaches, none of whom has managed in the Premier League. Potter faces a tough task to remodel Brighton\u2019s style after replacing Chris Hughton, Smith\u2019s Aston Villa must focus on survival after winning the Championship play-off final and Wilder needs to perform his latest miracle after taking Sheffield United from League One to the top flight. Yet it is lazy to assume all three will fail because of an apparent lack of glamour. When Smith arrived at Villa Park last October some saw stints at Brentford and Walsall on his CV and doubted if he was the man to get Villa promoted. Yet Dan Mole, Walsall\u2019s club secretary, knew better. \u201cThey\u2019re going on the name, not the man,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s lived his life in football. He\u2019s organised, disciplined and has a plan.\u201d Similarly Bobo Sollander, who played for Potter at \u00d6stersund and saw how he lifted an obscure club from the backwaters of Swedish football to the Europa League in the space of seven years, believes his old manager will be managing in the Champions League soon. \u201cI don\u2019t think his journey will be done with Brighton,\u201d Sollander says. \u201cHe is going to be a top-four coach in a couple of years. He is that good.\u201d English managers have often been written off as long-ball dinosaurs in recent years and tearing off that label can be hard. Yet every aspiring coach needs a break and for Wilder an opportunity arrived when he was in the twilight of his playing career at Alfreton in 2001. \u201cChris\u2019s enthusiasm was boundless,\u201d Wayne Bradley, Alfreton\u2019s chairman, says. \u201cHe had no experience but as much energy that you\u2019d ever want to come across. He wanted to get involved in everything \u2013 from what kit we played in to how we prepared for games.\u201d Wilder, 51, has taken a winding path since winning the quadruple inside 27 weeks with Alfreton. He moved to Halifax in 2002, had a brief stint as No 2 to his current assistant Alan Knill at Bury, took Oxford into the Football League in 2010, won League Two with Northampton in 2016 and has had a stunning impact since moving to Bramall Lane. There have also been hard times. He faced financial difficulties at Halifax and Northampton. Yet Joel Byrom, who played for Wilder at Northampton, remembers that spirits were always high. \u201cIf you produced for him at the weekend, he\u2019d give you a day off,\u201d he says. \u201cWe still have a group chat from that team. I still go away with some of the lads in the summer. You don\u2019t have that normally.\u201d Astute man-management is crucial: it helped Potter settle when the 44-year-old joined \u00d6stersund in 2010. \u201cIt was the way he said his door would always be open for you,\u201d Sollander says. \u201cIt always felt like if you needed to talk with him you could. He was easier to access than coaches I had before. When training was over they went home. Graham stayed and worked. There was always something new to think about.\u201d In Smith\u2019s case he is remembered at Walsall as a studious coach and a man who commanded respect. The 48-year-old started as the club\u2019s head of academy and has previously said he had no ambitions to become a manager. He fell into the job only when Walsall, battling against relegation from League One, sacked Chris Hutchings in January 2011. It turned out to be an inspired appointment. Smith kept Walsall up and had developed a reputation as one of the Football League\u2019s most progressive coaches by the time he joined Brentford in 2015. \u201cWhen Dean came in at the academy it did feel like that was where he\u2019d see his short-term career,\u201d Mole says. \u201cBut when we moved the manager on, Dean was probably the only one qualified to take the team. If it wasn\u2019t Dean, it was either me or the chief executive. Somehow he managed the great escape. From there he helped build a structure which saw us pushing for promotion in the season he left. \u201cHe has human qualities that sometimes get lost in football. Did I think he\u2019d end up in the Premier League? It\u2019s impossible to say. All I know is he is the best manager I have worked with. He\u2019s true to his philosophy and gets a buy-in from every element of a club.\u201d There are hard sides to these coaches, though. Byrom says there is a ruthless edge to Wilder, recalling that he would refuse to speak to anyone in the days after a defeat, while Sollander makes it clear that Potter was never overly pally with his players. Yet Sollander also points out that Potter, who has joined Brighton after a year stabilising Swansea, would never shout for no reason. \u201cThere was a meaning to it,\u201d he says. \u201cHe makes you a smarter footballer. He challenged the way you thought about football. He gave you the belief that this is how we wanted to play \u2013 and we were going to think about it. \u201cHe wanted to dominate the ball. We had a coach who talked a lot about playing positive football. But in games it was the opposite. He would shout: \u2018Kick the ball, kick the ball.\u2019 Graham never did that. Sometimes it is good to play long ball but you have to know when to do it. He showed when you should do it.\u201d Potter, Smith and Wilder want their teams to attack. Last season Wilder and Knill helped Sheffield United gain automatic promotion with a 3-5-2 system featuring overlapping centre-backs and Byrom tells a story from his Northampton days that deep tactical thinking is possible away from the Premier League. \u201cWhen we had the ball across the back four, Chris would tell the full-back to run up the pitch and as a midfielder I\u2019d drop in to get the ball in so much space,\u201d he says. \u201cIn League Two you don\u2019t get a lot of time on the ball in midfield. But when you dropped into that area you never got marked. \u201cThe first time he told me to do it we were doing a shape session in training and when the centre-back had the ball he told me to drop into left-back. The left-back just ran on. I didn\u2019t know what was going on. But when I did it in a game I wasn\u2019t getting marked. I\u2019d never seen it before at that level. A lot of midfielders weren\u2019t following me. People would be confused. They didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Premier League sides should prepare themselves for more surprises this season.",

If we had found the solution for problems we might have during the season we would have done it. It was not there for a reasonable price. Nobody should think we did not look. It is not that we are not negotiating like crazy in these times, but finding the right solution is more difficult the better the team gets. I really think it makes sense to keep this team together but we have to prove that.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to make our decisions based on our expectations of what we think we can do this year. By the way, the history of Liverpool does not end this season. We will judge the season and see what we have to do. Maybe then it will be easier to find improvement.\u201d</p> <p>Klopp\u2019s confidence is fuelled by having a stable core of young talent at Liverpool, the impact of winning the club\u2019s sixth European crown and the second-half performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/04/liverpool-manchester-city-community-shield-match-report\" title=\"\">against City in last weekend\u2019s Community Shield</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0bfcecb3558db4744acf7c47c174074925e9f79a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bfcecb3558db4744acf7c47c174074925e9f79a/380_162_3174_1904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Klopp was encouraged by his team\u2019s performance during the second half of the Community Shield at Wembley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Klopp was encouraged by his team\u2019s performance during the second half of the Community Shield at Wembley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said: \u201cThe big teams of the past \u2013 and I don\u2019t say we are a big team now, that will be decided in a couple of years \u2013 they stay together for a number of years. They do not need a lot of changes. I am not comparing us with Barcelona of five, six or seven years ago but they stayed together. A new player came in and struggled and so it was the same players who played again. Man United had the class of \u201992. How long did they stay together? They changed a few after [Eric] Cantona got older and brought in Van the Man [Ruud van Nistelrooy] or whoever. You do not change completely.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a good team together in a very difficult league with a lot of competitors desperate to get the position we are in.

But given the spending at Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United, and Frank Lampard\u2019s arrival at Chelsea, he expects a more condensed title race this season.</p> <p>Klopp said: \u201cFor me, it looks like this season will be different because there was a big gap between the other teams and us and City. It looks like we will all be closer to each other than last season. If that is the case then you cannot get 97 or 98 points. We don\u2019t know in this moment. The only thing we know is that nothing will happen for us in a positive direction if we don\u2019t win our games. We have to start with that on Friday.

      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp believes Liverpool will improve this season without new signings and 98 points may not be required to win the Premier League given increased competition among the leading pack. Norwich City\u2019s visit to Anfield on Friday represents Liverpool\u2019s deadline day, according to their manager, who signed only one senior player on the back of winning the Champions League and that was a second-choice goalkeeper in Adri\u00e1n. Klopp admitted Liverpool tried to strengthen but could not land targets who would enhance his European champions for a reasonable price. However, he remains confident the squad at his disposal has the capacity to continue improving and challenge Manchester City for the title once again. \u201cAround 90% of our people are with us on the transfer policy and 10% maybe not, but they are on social media and they are constantly worried people,\u201d claimed the Liverpool manager, who has Sadio Man\u00e9 available for the Premier League opener. \u201cThis team is a good age with space for improvement. If we had found the solution for problems we might have during the season we would have done it. It was not there for a reasonable price. Nobody should think we did not look. It is not that we are not negotiating like crazy in these times, but finding the right solution is more difficult the better the team gets. I really think it makes sense to keep this team together but we have to prove that. \u201cWe have to make our decisions based on our expectations of what we think we can do this year. By the way, the history of Liverpool does not end this season. We will judge the season and see what we have to do. Maybe then it will be easier to find improvement.\u201d Klopp\u2019s confidence is fuelled by having a stable core of young talent at Liverpool, the impact of winning the club\u2019s sixth European crown and the second-half performance against City in last weekend\u2019s Community Shield. He said: \u201cThe big teams of the past \u2013 and I don\u2019t say we are a big team now, that will be decided in a couple of years \u2013 they stay together for a number of years. They do not need a lot of changes. I am not comparing us with Barcelona of five, six or seven years ago but they stayed together. A new player came in and struggled and so it was the same players who played again. Man United had the class of \u201992. How long did they stay together? They changed a few after [Eric] Cantona got older and brought in Van the Man [Ruud van Nistelrooy] or whoever. You do not change completely. \u201cWe are a good team together in a very difficult league with a lot of competitors desperate to get the position we are in. Nobody knows how it will look exactly but Sunday showed we will be fine and the rest is what we make of it.\u201d The Liverpool manager believes it is \u201cimportant you don\u2019t compare seasons\u201d and is wary of claiming his team can emulate or improve on last season\u2019s 97 points, a club-record haul that still was not enough to secure a first league title since 1990. But given the spending at Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United, and Frank Lampard\u2019s arrival at Chelsea, he expects a more condensed title race this season. Klopp said: \u201cFor me, it looks like this season will be different because there was a big gap between the other teams and us and City. It looks like we will all be closer to each other than last season. If that is the case then you cannot get 97 or 98 points. We don\u2019t know in this moment. The only thing we know is that nothing will happen for us in a positive direction if we don\u2019t win our games. We have to start with that on Friday. Friday for us is deadline day because pre-season is over and now we have to perform as good as possible. \u201cA season has a story, and there are different chapters, but without a first word you cannot start. We start our story on Friday and there is no reason why it should not be a wonderful story.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has called on the UK\u2019s most senior civil servant to intervene to stop Boris Johnson forcing a no-deal Brexit in the middle of an election campaign, amid rising signs the country is heading for the polls again this autumn. The Labour leader wrote to Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, accusing the prime minister of plotting an \u201cunprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power\u201d, after it emerged No 10 would be prepared to delay an election until immediately after 31 October if Johnson loses a no confidence vote among MPs. In his letter, Corbyn demanded urgent clarification of the rules around purdah, which are meant to prevent the government taking major policy decisions during an election campaign. He asked Sedwill to confirm that if the UK is due to leave the EU without a deal during an election campaign, then the government must seek an extension to article 50 and allow an incoming administration to take a decision about Brexit on the basis of the result. \u201cForcing through no deal against a decision of parliament, and denying the choice to the voters in a general election already underway, would be an unprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power by a prime minister elected, not by the public, but by a small number of unrepresentative Conservative party members,\u201d he said. \u201cI am therefore writing to seek your urgent clarification on the proper application of \u2018purdah\u2019 rules in such a scenario and the constitutional implications of failing to abide by those rules.\u201d Corbyn released the letter as No 10 refused to rule out delaying an election until the immediate few days after Brexit on 31 October if one is triggered by MPs voting down Johnson\u2019s government and failing to form another administration. Asked by the BBC on Thursday if he would resign if he lost a confidence vote, Johnson swerved the question, and stressed the need to leave the EU on 31 October. \u201cI think that what MPs should do and what I think they\u2019ve already voted to do, when triggering article 50 and reconfirmed several times, is honour the mandate of the people and leave the EU on 31 October,\u201d he said. He also insisted there was \u201cbags of time\u201d for the EU to \u201cshow some flexibility\u201d and agree to ditch the Irish backstop, which he claimed could make the UK into a \u201csatellite state\u201d of Brussels. No 10 and the Conservative machine appear to be getting into election mode with the appointment of Isaac Levido, a former staffer for Lynton Crosby, as a new director of politics and campaigning. The Treasury also announced it would begin a one-year spending review in September, raising the prospect that Johnson wants to make money available for pre-election giveaways in education, health and policing. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, said it was aimed at giving departments certainty about funding ahead of Brexit on 31 October and delivering on promises of 20,000 extra police officers, additional funding for schools, as well as delivering the government\u2019s pledges on the NHS. But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said it \u201csmacks of pre-election panic measures by the government\u201d. \u201cJohnson is splashing a little bit of cash as a publicity stunt, but keeping the door open for even more austerity if a no-deal Brexit breaks the economy,\u201d he said. The prime minister could face a confidence vote as soon as he comes back from recess in the first week of September, which he may lose if Tory MPs decide to join with opposition parties to bring down the government. Parliament would have 14 days to find an alternative government, but if that failed, then an election would be triggered. There would be time to hold one before the scheduled Brexit day of 31 October but the law says the date is \u201con the recommendation of the prime minister\u201d, implying Johnson might be able to choose the date \u2013 possibly in the first week of November. No 10 had no comment on Corbyn\u2019s letter, but a senior Conservative source echoed a statement from Dominic Cummings earlier this week, saying: \u201cNo amount of letter writing political stunts will change the fact that politicians don\u2019t get to choose which public votes they respect.\u201d The Cabinet Office declined to provide clarification of the purdah rules on Thursday but said Sedwill would respond to Corbyn in due course. Labour is taking no chances and preparing heavily for an election, releasing a highly personal attack advertisement on Thursday that portrayed Johnson as someone who cannot be trusted. It referenced his sacking by former Tory leader Michael Howard for lying about an affair, and accused him of lying about policy issues such as shutting ticket offices on the London Underground after promising to keep them open. Labour has selected candidates in 75 target seats but some MPs said they were also concerned about the party\u2019s own readiness and financial situation. Little progress had been made on selections in seats where MPs have defected or plan to retire, though that has been ramped up this month with new candidates being chosen in Birkenhead and Stockport. Backbench Conservative MPs were highly alarmed about the idea of an election just days after an unpredictable no-deal Brexit, possibly in the midst of food shortages, travel disruption and trade difficulties. One former cabinet minister said they believed Tory prospects would be dire in a post-Brexit election anyway, because of the under-appreciated threat from remain voters. \u201cWe shed Scotland MPs, demographically die in London, get killed in the south-west by the Lib Dems and lose south-east heartlands because of jobs loss worries. Where is the core? It\u2019s madness, and all predictable,\u201d they said. Several Tory MPs said they were sceptical about whether No 10 really would pursue such a risky move, and regarded it as a possible ploy to scare would-be rebels away from voting down the government in a confidence motion and triggering an election that could put Corbyn in No 10. The cross-party group plotting against a no-deal Brexit is already nervous about holding a confidence motion without being completely sure of having the numbers to support an alternative government, in which a compromise candidate such as Ken Clarke or Yvette Cooper would request an extension to article 50. They are increasingly nervous after the Labour frontbench said they would not support an alternative government and the rebels would have to get behind Corbyn as a temporary prime minister if they wanted to stop a no-deal Brexit. McDonnell quipped on Wednesday that he would send Corbyn in a taxi to Buckingham Palace to see the Queen if Johnson lost a confidence motion and refused to resign. One Labour MP involved in cross-party discussions said there was a preference among many Tories to try legislative routes for stopping no deal, before going for the more radical option of replacing the government. Even some pro-Brexit supporters of Johnson were highly alarmed about the idea of an early November election. A senior Tory close to Conservative campaign headquarters said the party would obviously be ready for any eventuality but he was \u201chighly doubtful\u201d that Johnson would risk such a move.",

The reproductive healthcare reform bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/08/nsw-abortion-bill-passes-first-hurdle\">passed 59 votes to 31 just before 11pm on Thursday</a>, though not without amendments. Doctors will now have a statutory requirement to gain \u201cinformed consent\u201d before performing abortions, to assess whether it would be \u201cbeneficial\u201d to discuss counselling with the woman, and to provide them with options for accessing it if they were interested. The bill will be scrutinised by the parliament\u2019s social issues committee before a vote in the upper house.</p> <p><strong>The Hong Kong casino magnate Lawrence Ho bought almost 10% of Crown Resorts from James Packer</strong> at the same time as he was a director of a company banned from involvement with Crown owing to its links with Ho\u2019s father, Stanley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/08/packer-sold-share-of-crown-to-tycoon-who-was-director-of-banned-company\">documents show</a>. The NSW parliament has launched an inquiry into the $1.75bn purchase, and will also look at various matters raised in media reports relating to Crown Resorts. These include that the AFP had been investigating allegations of money laundering at Crown\u2019s Melbourne casino at the time the NSW regulator was conducting its probity review into Crown\u2019s suitability to operate a high-roller casino at Barangaroo.</p> <p><strong>Labor\u2019s health spokesman has called into question the government\u2019s progress in tackling HTLV-1 in Aboriginal communities in central Australia</strong>, which have the world\u2019s highest rates of the fatal virus. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/24/people-are-scared-the-fight-against-a-deadly-virus-no-one-has-heard-of\">In April last year, Guardian Australia revealed</a> that in five communities around Alice Springs, more than 45% of adults tested have the virus, a rate thousands of times<strong> </strong>higher than for non-Indigenous Australians.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 9 August. Top stories A historic bill to decriminalise abortion in NSW has cleared its first hurdle after passing the state\u2019s lower house. The reproductive healthcare reform bill passed 59 votes to 31 just before 11pm on Thursday, though not without amendments. Doctors will now have a statutory requirement to gain \u201cinformed consent\u201d before performing abortions, to assess whether it would be \u201cbeneficial\u201d to discuss counselling with the woman, and to provide them with options for accessing it if they were interested. The bill will be scrutinised by the parliament\u2019s social issues committee before a vote in the upper house. The Hong Kong casino magnate Lawrence Ho bought almost 10% of Crown Resorts from James Packer at the same time as he was a director of a company banned from involvement with Crown owing to its links with Ho\u2019s father, Stanley, documents show. The NSW parliament has launched an inquiry into the $1.75bn purchase, and will also look at various matters raised in media reports relating to Crown Resorts. These include that the AFP had been investigating allegations of money laundering at Crown\u2019s Melbourne casino at the time the NSW regulator was conducting its probity review into Crown\u2019s suitability to operate a high-roller casino at Barangaroo. Labor\u2019s health spokesman has called into question the government\u2019s progress in tackling HTLV-1 in Aboriginal communities in central Australia, which have the world\u2019s highest rates of the fatal virus. In April last year, Guardian Australia revealed that in five communities around Alice Springs, more than 45% of adults tested have the virus, a rate thousands of times higher than for non-Indigenous Australians. After that reporting the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, announced an $8m taskforce to look at HTLV-1 and other communicable diseases in remote communities. But Labor\u2019s Chris Bowen says the issue is at crisis levels. He wants the taskforce to provide regular updates to parliament, \u201cso we can assess and review efforts to tackle the disease\u201d. World Boris Johnson has said he hopes the EU will \u201cshow common sense\u201d and agree a new Brexit deal, as his aide refused to rule out scheduling an election in the first days after leaving the EU on 31 October if the British PM loses a confidence motion. The unprecedented communications blackout imposed on Indian-administered Kashmir could signal a departure in the way democratic states clamp down on information in contentious areas, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on freedom of expression has said. Two people have been killed and radiation levels reportedly rose after a rocket engine exploded during a test in northern Russia, prompting authorities to close a portion of the White Sea to civilian ships for a month. The Trump administration has reauthorised government officials to use controversial devices \u2013 dubbed \u201ccyanide bombs\u201d by critics \u2013 to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals. The merciless dogfight between Mexican drug cartels has produced its latest macabre spectacle, with the discovery of 19 mutilated corpses \u2013 nine of them hung semi-naked from a bridge \u2013 in a city west of the capital. Opinion and analysis Shayna Jack\u2019s positive drug test has thrown the spotlight on supplements in elite sport. But supplements are not just taken by Olympic athletes and AFL players.

On the other side of that line there are no shock absorbers. And of course, the journey is more jarring and perilous.\u201d Sport After decades of silence, hushed conversations and careers quietly ended before their time, the AFL has finally pushed the mental health and wellbeing of players to the foreground with the appointment of Dr Kate Hall as the AFL\u2019s head of mental health and Dr Ranjit Menon as chief psychiatrist. European football\u2019s summer transfer window has just closed and the Guardian has compiled an exhaustive interactive detailing every major deal. Major transfers include Ryan Sessegnon moving from Fulham to Tottenham for $50m, Kieran Tierney from Celtic to Arsenal for $50m, and Romelu Lukaku from Manchester United to Inter for a staggering $140m.

John Jeffrey, chairman of the laws\u2019 review group, confirmed that, in addition to player welfare, there were \u201calso clear benefits to improving the spectacle for player, match officials and fans\u201d. For current England tight forwards such as Dan Cole, however, the more immediate priority is the new scrummaging law which, for safety reasons, now forbids front-row players from placing their heads on the shoulders of opponents between the calls of \u201cbind\u201d and \u201cset\u201d. England and Wales will meet at Twickenham on Sunday with both teams slightly unsure how things will pan out. \u201cIt will be our first hit at it and Wales\u2019s first so we will see,\u201d said England\u2019s prop. \u201cYou want the scrum to be seen in the best light possible. You don\u2019t want it to became a negative point where it is just a mess and everyone goes: \u2018Get rid of the scrum.\u2019\u201d Both teams are due to announce their starting lineups on Friday for the opening warm-up Test of the Quilter summer series, with England preparing to confirm their final 31-man World Cup squad on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s the pinnacle of our careers and will potentially be some of the best weeks of our lives,\u201d the lock Joe Launchbury said. \u201cYou want to do all you can to be a part of it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Uber lost $5.24bn in the last three months, its largest-ever quarterly loss, news that sent the ride-hailing company\u2019s shares sliding 10%. The company was reporting earnings for only the second time following its share sale in May. The latest losses were worse than analysts had expected and the company announced revenues that were also below predictions. Uber\u2019s revenues rose 14% to $3.17bn in the second quarter, below analysts\u2019 expectations of $3.3bn and the smallest percentage on record. The company\u2019s share price, which had climbed over 8% during the day, fell more than 10% in after hours trading. Earlier, Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, told CNBC that 2019 would be \u201cour peak investment year and we think that 2020, 2021, you\u2019ll see losses come down\u201d. Uber\u2019s huge losses have worried investors and the company\u2019s shares have only closed above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $45 twice since its share sale. Last month the company announced it was cutting 400 jobs from its marketing team as it tried to get costs under control. The latest quarterly loss was largely down to stock-based compensation related to its IPO, but excluding those costs, Uber losses were about $1.3bn, close to 30% worse than in the preceding quarter. The company is locked in competition with its rival Lyft and is spending on a range of newer businesses including food delivery, Uber Eats, and freight. Lyft announced better-than-expected revenue figures on Wednesday, \u201cWhile we will continue to invest aggressively in growth, we also want it to be healthy growth, and this quarter we made good progress in that direction,\u201d said Nelson Chai, chief financial officer.

David Luiz arrives two months after the retirement of his former Chelsea teammate Petr Cech, who spent the final four years of his career at Arsenal. The opportunity to work at greater length with Emery, with whom he crossed paths for two months at Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, may have made his decision easier. In May, shortly before he anchored Chelsea to a 4-1 Europa League final win over Arsenal, he described Emery as \u201ca great guy, a great coach, a great person\u201d.

The hope will be that his experience rubs off on players such as Tierney, a hugely talented 22-year-old who Arsenal have tracked for a number of years and have now secured on a long-term deal. Tierney has been capped 12 times by Scotland, who are particularly well-stocked in his position given the presence of Liverpool\u2019s Andy Robertson. There are similarities between the two: Tierney is a reliable defender but especially effective going forward and, at his best, sends across a stream of dangerous deliveries from the left.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the hardest decision in my whole life that I\u2019ve had to make,\u201d Tierney, who came through the youth ranks at Celtic and made 170 first-team appearances, told Arsenal\u2019s club website.</p> <p>\u201cI had to speak to my family and my close friends and my agent as well because it\u2019s a hard decision to leave a club that you love so much.

I\u2019ve made my dream, I\u2019ve lived my dream and I\u2019ve loved every single minute of it. Now I just feel was the right time to take a step on.

He scored 15 goals in 149 appearances for the club since making his own journey through the academy although questions always lingered about his efficiency. At 23 there is time for that to improve; Everton will be the beneficiaries if it does and in the meantime Reiss Nelson, who enjoyed an impressive half-season on loan with Bundesliga side Hoffenheim last season, may be given an extended opportunity in the matchday squad by Emery. Bukayo Saka, a highly-rated 17-year-old who broke through last season, may also be fast-tracked.</p> <p>Arsenal also received a fee on Thursday for Dominic Thompson, a 19-year-old left-back who is yet to make an appearance in senior football but has shown enough promise to tempt Championship side Brentford into a \u00a33m move.

      "bodyText": "A crowdfunded spacecraft has successfully sailed on sunlight while in orbit around the Earth. LightSail 2 was launched in June by the space advocacy group the Planetary Society as a secondary payload on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. On 24 July, the tiny craft \u2013 which measures just 10 x 10 x 30 cm \u2013 deployed a 32-square-metre reflective sail. The society reported that the extra thrust received by the sail changed the shape of its orbit by about 2km at its furthest point from Earth. Although photons of light do not have any mass, they do carry energy and this means they have momentum. A reflective solar sail captures that momentum and transfers it to the spacecraft, just like a sailing ship captures the momentum from the wind. Solar sails are attractive prospects because they could be used to manoeuvre in orbit without the need for fuel or engines. Larger versions could also travel between planets. LightSail 2 is only the second time a solar sail has been used to propel a spacecraft. In 2010, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used a much larger solar sail (196 square metres) to fly the Ikaros spacecraft past Venus.",

On 17 November, the anniversary of that event, the Polytechnic often resembles a war zone as police battle it out with anarchists and other youngsters lobbing Molotov cocktails at them from inside the premises. The so-called asylum law was conceived as a safeguard against students ever again suffering the heavy hand of authoritarianism. But, in a society prone to protesting by rioting, many believe the ban had outlived its usefulness and had helped breed a culture of violence that has frequently driven Greeks to seek higher education abroad at great expense.

      "body": "<p>A modern trend with corporate apologies is to get them in early while being gloriously vague about what it is you are apologising for. Hargreaves Lansdown adopted this approach with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/08/neil-woodford-fund-manager-rise-and-fall-investors-bright-star-black-hole\">Neil Woodford</a> affair, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/aug/07/hedge-fund-muddy-waterss-report-knocks-burford-capital-shares\">mentioned here </a>on Wednesday, in the hope that its chief executive, Chris Hill, would offer clarity when unveiling the group\u2019s full-year profits.</p> <p>No chance. Hill wouldn\u2019t budge from his flat script. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/08/hargreaves-lansdown-to-lose-2m-by-waiving-fees-on-neil-woodford-fund\">He says</a> he has apologised to clients <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/29/neil-woodford-sells-shares-woodford-patient-capital-trust\">trapped</a> in the Woodford Equity Income Fund \u201cbecause we all share their disappointment and frustration\u201d. OK, but that reads like an airy expression of sympathy rather than an apology for any action by Hargreaves.</p> <p>Does Hill, for example, think Hargreaves overstepped the role of a nominally neutral platform provider in being so bullish about all things Woodford? Does he regret sticking with the fund manager until the end? Does he think that Hargreaves should have yanked the Equity Income fund from its Wealth 50 list as soon it started to worry about liquidity risks, which was as long ago as November 2017, as detailed in Hill\u2019s own letter to the Treasury select committee?</p> <p>He won\u2019t be drawn. He says there will be \u201clearnings and improvements we can make\u201d but, even two months after the Woodford fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/03/neil-woodford-blocks-investors-from-pulling-cash-from-flagship-fund\">suspended dealings</a>, he\u2019s not yet in a position to share them. His only substantive conclusion is that \u201cwe are confident in the robustness of how we analyse, research and compile our favourite fund list\u201d.</p> <p>It would, of course, be absurd to expect Hargreaves to pick only winners in its \u201cbest buy\u201d list. That task would be impossible. But then we\u2019re back at the beginning. What is the apology supposed to cover?</p> <p>Hargreaves shareholders won\u2019t care. For them, the important news was that waiving fees on the Woodford fund costs only \u00a3360,000 a month, peanuts for a company making pre-tax profits of \u00a3306m last year at its usual astonishing profit margin of 64%. The shares rose 12%.</p> <p>It would be hard, though, to say Hill\u2019s personal stock has risen during this saga. He waited until the 11th hour to forgo his bonus and still can\u2019t say what, if anything, Hargreaves would have done differently. Not impressive.</p> <h2><strong>Aviva\u2019s new boss shows sign of being radical</strong></h2> <p>Maurice Tulloch became chief executive of the giant insurer Aviva only in March, so long-suffering shareholders will have to wait until November to see his new strategy, which is fair enough. In the meantime, he\u2019s serving an <em>amuse</em>-<em>bouche</em> \u2013 a review of the Asian operation.</p> <p>This may ultimately amount to little, it should be said, since doing nothing is an option. But the outcome could also be the sale of a unit worth $2bn-plus, according to analysts, or a joint venture partnership with a local operator.</p> <p>Even a formal review suggests a willingness to be radical, or so investors will hope. Asia, after all, was a pet project of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/09/aviva-chief-steps-down-insurance-firm-mark-wilson\">former boss Mark Wilson</a>, whose grand claim to have transformed Aviva is not reflected in the share price. At 389p, the shares sit at 2013 levels. At the birth of Aviva, via a three-way merger at the turn of the century, the stock was at \u00a311.</p> <p>That long-term perspective should serve as a prompt to Tulloch. His many predecessors have voiced his same ambition to make Aviva \u201csimpler\u201d but none has achieved it. If the only effective way is to start by making the insurer smaller, go for it.</p> <h2>Burford Capital opens its defence</h2> <p>The litigation funder Burford Capital is as angry as ever about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/07/burford-capital-shares-down-in-further-blow-to-neil-woodford\">the attack from short-selling US hedge Muddy Waters</a>, but let\u2019s give it some credit. Thursday\u2019s nine-page counter-blast was a decent production. It was written in English, rather than legalese, which was a virtue. Some of the tangled legal cases Burford fights almost became intelligible.</p> <p>The reward was a 26% bounce in a share price that almost halved on Wednesday. There\u2019s no knowing where it\u2019ll settle, of course, but one moral is clear. If your business is as complex as Burford\u2019s, keep explaining.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A modern trend with corporate apologies is to get them in early while being gloriously vague about what it is you are apologising for. Hargreaves Lansdown adopted this approach with the Neil Woodford affair, as mentioned here on Wednesday, in the hope that its chief executive, Chris Hill, would offer clarity when unveiling the group\u2019s full-year profits. No chance. Hill wouldn\u2019t budge from his flat script. He says he has apologised to clients trapped in the Woodford Equity Income Fund \u201cbecause we all share their disappointment and frustration\u201d. OK, but that reads like an airy expression of sympathy rather than an apology for any action by Hargreaves. Does Hill, for example, think Hargreaves overstepped the role of a nominally neutral platform provider in being so bullish about all things Woodford? Does he regret sticking with the fund manager until the end? Does he think that Hargreaves should have yanked the Equity Income fund from its Wealth 50 list as soon it started to worry about liquidity risks, which was as long ago as November 2017, as detailed in Hill\u2019s own letter to the Treasury select committee? He won\u2019t be drawn. He says there will be \u201clearnings and improvements we can make\u201d but, even two months after the Woodford fund suspended dealings, he\u2019s not yet in a position to share them. His only substantive conclusion is that \u201cwe are confident in the robustness of how we analyse, research and compile our favourite fund list\u201d. It would, of course, be absurd to expect Hargreaves to pick only winners in its \u201cbest buy\u201d list. That task would be impossible. But then we\u2019re back at the beginning. What is the apology supposed to cover? Hargreaves shareholders won\u2019t care. For them, the important news was that waiving fees on the Woodford fund costs only \u00a3360,000 a month, peanuts for a company making pre-tax profits of \u00a3306m last year at its usual astonishing profit margin of 64%. The shares rose 12%. It would be hard, though, to say Hill\u2019s personal stock has risen during this saga. He waited until the 11th hour to forgo his bonus and still can\u2019t say what, if anything, Hargreaves would have done differently. Not impressive. Aviva\u2019s new boss shows sign of being radical Maurice Tulloch became chief executive of the giant insurer Aviva only in March, so long-suffering shareholders will have to wait until November to see his new strategy, which is fair enough. In the meantime, he\u2019s serving an amuse-bouche \u2013 a review of the Asian operation. This may ultimately amount to little, it should be said, since doing nothing is an option. But the outcome could also be the sale of a unit worth $2bn-plus, according to analysts, or a joint venture partnership with a local operator. Even a formal review suggests a willingness to be radical, or so investors will hope. Asia, after all, was a pet project of the former boss Mark Wilson, whose grand claim to have transformed Aviva is not reflected in the share price. At 389p, the shares sit at 2013 levels. At the birth of Aviva, via a three-way merger at the turn of the century, the stock was at \u00a311. That long-term perspective should serve as a prompt to Tulloch. His many predecessors have voiced his same ambition to make Aviva \u201csimpler\u201d but none has achieved it. If the only effective way is to start by making the insurer smaller, go for it. Burford Capital opens its defence The litigation funder Burford Capital is as angry as ever about the attack from short-selling US hedge Muddy Waters, but let\u2019s give it some credit. Thursday\u2019s nine-page counter-blast was a decent production. It was written in English, rather than legalese, which was a virtue. Some of the tangled legal cases Burford fights almost became intelligible. The reward was a 26% bounce in a share price that almost halved on Wednesday. There\u2019s no knowing where it\u2019ll settle, of course, but one moral is clear. If your business is as complex as Burford\u2019s, keep explaining.",

The spring-loaded traps, called M-44s, are filled with sodium cyanide and are most frequently deployed by Wildlife Services, a federal agency in the US Department of Agriculture that kills vast numbers of wild animals each year, primarily for the benefit of private farmers and ranchers. In 2018, Wildlife Services reported that its agents had dispatched more than 1.5 million native animals, from beavers to black bears, wolves, ducks and owls. Roughly 6,500 of them were killed by M-44s. On Tuesday, after completing the first phase of a routine review, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would allow sodium cyanide\u2019s continued use in M-44s across the country on an interim basis.

In May, in response to advocacy by environmental groups, Oregon\u2019s governor Kate Brown signed a ban on the use of the traps in the state. In 2017, Wildlife Services agreed to temporarily halt the use of M-44s in Colorado after environmental groups sued. The agency also stopped using them in Idaho after the Mansfield case came to light. In the months before the EPA announced the reauthorization, conservation groups and members of the public flooded the agency with comments calling for a complete national ban on the predator-killing poison. According to an analysis provided by the Center for Biological Diversity, which is a leading opponent of M-44s, 99.9% of all comments received by the EPA opposed the reauthorization of sodium cyanide for predator control purposes. Although the agency took a different view, it did impose new restrictions on the use of M-44s. Among other things, the agency will now prohibit government officials from placing M-44s within 100 feet of public roads or trails. The agency\u2019s reauthorization decision is only an interim one and a final decision on the matter is expected to come down after 2021. Brooks Fahy, the executive director of the environmental group Predator Defense and a leading opponent of M-44s, denounced the EPA\u2019s decision. It is a \u201ccomplete disaster\u201d, he said. \u201c[The EPA] ignored the facts and they ignored cases that, without a doubt, demonstrate that there is no way M-44s can be used safely.\u201d In response to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment, the EPA referenced the documentation of the decision on its website.",

But after a furious Zaha handed in a transfer request, it is understood Palace considered reviving the move and began searching for replacements, with Rennes winger Ismaila Sarr and CSKA Moscow striker Fyodor Chalov their preferred targets. But with not much time remaining to secure those deals, it appears at this stage that the Ivory Coast forward will not leave Selhurst Park because no club has matched Palace\u2019s valuation.

      "bodyText": "Ok, we are going to leave this right here. Those deals for Luiz, Iwobi and Danso are still to be confirmed, though we expect them to, and will push this figure yet higher. Look out for the news stories on the completion on those deals and the confirmation in our exhaustive transfer interactive. Thanks for reading. DONE DEAL: Dennis Praet is done. Ben Brideside with a reminder of Manchester City\u2019s window. \u201cOne that seems to have slipped beneath the radar. City have signed Pedro Porro from Girona for about \u20ac12m today. He\u2019ll later be loaned out to another club in La Liga. Porro is a very promising defender, so although City are weakening one of their sister clubs, it\u2019s to provide Girona with much needed funds while adding another high potential teenager to the roll call of CFG itinerants scattered across the world. Everyone\u2019s a winner.\u201d Valladolid appears to be the likely destination. Everton have confirmed Mo Besic\u2019s move to Sheffield United is complete. Season-long loan. Of those late moves done on a DEAL SHEET, Dennis Praet to Leicester and Mo Besic to Sheffield United look to have been done. We await news of Iwobi to Everton, Luiz to Arsenal and Kevin Danso to Southampton. But barring accident, we expect them to be done. Some detail on why one of the most heavily trailed deals of the summer won\u2019t be going through, even if Bayern Munich would still have the rest of the month to sign San\u00e9. Rotten luck for everyone involved. Another Burnley deal completed as the window SLAMMED SHUT was Nahki Wells leaving on loan for QPR, where he spent last season on loan. It appears that Southampton\u2019s mystery man is indeed Kevin Danso of Augsburg, a young man who grew up in Milton Keynes, and began his career at Reading. And here\u2019s an update on Spurs\u2019 very busy day. Steve Bruce invokes Burt Lancaster and Mark Knopfler here. Good on Danny Drinkwater. That he ended up at Chelsea registers as one of the oddest, most wasteful deals of recent years. Isaac Vassell, cousin of, yes, Darius, has joined Cardiff on a three-year contract from Birmingham. With an hour to go before those final deals can be completed I\u2019m going to hand over to John Brewin. Bye! Josh Onomah has joined Fulham as part of the deal that has taken Ryan Sessegnon to Tottenham. Meanwhile we are still waiting for confirmation of David Luiz to Arsenal and Alex Iwobi to Everton. Chelsea midfielder Trevor Chalobah to Huddersfield on season-long loan Meanwhile Danny Drinkwater has joined Burnley on from Chelsea. Burnley will win the league if they can get Kante in January. The Fulham winger joins for \u00a325m. Despite the failure to land Paulo Dybala it\u2019s been a good window for Spurs. Could this be Southampton\u2019s mystery man? Southampton have submitted a deal sheet but it\u2019s very much touch and go as to whether anything is completed before 7pm. Saints are brilliant at sealing deals under the radar, as they did with Charlie Austin, who has departed to West Brom for \u00a34m today, three years ago. Meanwhile, Beram Kayal and Tomer Hemed are heading to Charlton on loan from Brighton. Mo Besic on his way to Sheffield United from Everton. Paperwork in on time for that deal too. This means Southampton have until 7pm to get one more over the line. This feels like a big signing for Spurs. Forget Iwobi, Bristol City hope to complete the loan signing of Benik Afobe from Stoke City. The Championship club lost out to Leeds in the race to sign Arsenal youngster Eddie Nketiah but hope to get a forward through the door. Meanwhile, the Robins midfielder Marlon Pack could join Aden Flint at Cardiff City. Chelsea\u2019s Kenedy didn\u2019t end up joining Reading in the end. Meanwhile we are waiting for confirmation of Danny Drinkwater\u2019s loan to Burnley. And the Blues have also failed to shift Michael Hector. Manchester City have confirmed that Leroy Sane has damaged the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. Sane was injured during the Community Shield on Sunday and the winger, who was a target for Bayern Munich, will need to have surgery. Still, at least City have signed Scott Carson. Everton have lodged the necessary paperwork with the Premier League for the Alex Iwobi transfer to go through in the next few hours. Deal for Marcos Rojo fell through as Everton wanted only a loan and Manchester United were insistent on a permanent deal. Everton will not be signing Marcos Rojo from Manchester United. For all their attacking reinforcements Everton have left themselves a little light in central defence. Unai Emery is happy about the arrival of Kieran Tierney at Arsenal. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted Kieran is joining us. He\u2019s a very talented player who will continue to improve. He increases our options defensively and I look forward to him joining our group.\u201d The BBC\u2019s David Ornstein, normally very reliable when it comes to Arsenal, says that Everton have agreed a deal to sign Alex Iwobi. The winger scored three league goals last season. The fee could be as much as \u00a340m. It\u2019s 5pm. The transfer window is shut. But we wait to see if some deals can be squeezed in after the deadline. Look at him. A one-year deal for Andy Carroll at Newcastle. He hopes to be fit soon. Danny Drinkwater has joined Burnley on loan from Chelsea. What a glorious time he had at Stamford Bridge. The Celtic left-back joins for \u00a325m. That looks a really good signing for Arsenal. There is talk that Arsenal\u2019s Alex Iwobi is going to join Everton. \u201cIt seems we have a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s David Luiz, simultaneously still at Chelsea and also gone to Arsenal, stuck in a superposition until someone checks the paperwork to make sure,\u201d Kari Tulinius says. Hull have signed Matthew Pennington on loan from Everton. The 24-year-old centre-back will spend the season at the Tigers after previous loan spells at Leeds and Ipswich. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased to be here and I\u2019m feeling fit and ready to go,\u201d Pennington said. \u201cAs soon as I became aware of the interest in me from Hull City I was straight onto it. I was looking to get back out on loan and was ready to come back into the Championship so I\u2019m looking forward to the season ahead.\u201d Have Arsenal signed David Luiz yet? Have they forgotten about him? \u201cAnd if he could just give us back Luke Shaw\u2019s stats file...\u201d Here\u2019s a suggestion from Spain that Paul Pogba will be staying at Manchester United. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening,\u201d Jim White shouts on Sky Sports News. But it isn\u2019t all happening, is it. We go again. Under an hour to go. I now own Paulo Dybala\u2019s image rights and will listen to reasonable offers. And breathe. Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg to see you through until 5pm. The 20-year-old Arsenal striker arrives on a season\u2019s loan. That is a major coup for Leeds, who fought off competition from several clubs, notably Bristol City. Nketiah is the club\u2019s sixth signing of the summer, after the young France Under-20 goalkeeper Illan Meslier arrived on loan from Lorient earlier. Lukaku has swapped the Premier League for Serie A. And Inter have paid Manchester United \u00a374m for the privilege. Do not fear: Wilfried Zaha is staying at Crystal Palace. Leaning out his car window a la Harry Redknapp, Roy Hodgson, wearing a smart pair of shades, says Zaha is sticking around for another season. \u201cYes, he\u2019s staying,\u201d Hodgson says, talking to Sky Sports. We are pleased about that, he\u2019s an important player for the club and I\u2019m really looking forward to him this season doing what he has done the last two seasons. Today he wasn\u2019t really in the right frame of mind so I sent him home [from training] today, which is understandable, on the last day of the transfer window. It has been well documented that he has wanted to leave but it has not worked out for him in that respect. He is a professional, he has a good contract with us and I believe he respects us at the training ground. We expect him to come back and do what he does. I think everyone here has a good relationship with him. His beef unfortunately is with the chairman and owners of the club because he is wanting to leave and they haven\u2019t received the offer that they think is sufficient to allow him to leave. He has to come to terms with that. When you sign long-term contracts, you are expected to honour them and we expect him to do that.\u201d Arsenal continue to work on their two deals for David Luiz and Kieran Tierney, with both players undergoing medicals today. Don\u2019t expect any announcements imminently; the club anticipate things could go to the wire with these two, so we could be in post-5pm territory if the formalities take a particularly long time to tick off. On the outgoing side, Nketiah\u2019s loan move to Leeds is all done. The Australia midfielder joins on a one-year loan deal from Huddersfield. Cleverly on Huddersfield\u2019s part, Mooy has signed a new three-year contract with the club, which runs until 2022, ensuring the player\u2019s value will not plummet. \u201cAaron was adamant that he wanted to test himself again in the Premier League when Brighton\u2019s interest came in, and we didn\u2019t want an issue where we had a disillusioned player on the pitch in the final year of his contract,\u201d says Jan Siewert. \u201cWe had to look after the interests of Huddersfield Town and couldn\u2019t let him leave on a free at the end of the season, so him signing a new contract ahead of his loan move gives the club and the player possibilities for the future.\u201d Done deal klaxon: Leeds defender Tom Pearce has joined Wigan on a three-year deal. Fee of around \u00a3300,000. But a big Leeds incoming is expected shortly ... Eddie Nketiah, the 20-year-old England youth international, has been in the building at Elland Road ahead of sealing a season-long loan move from Arsenal. The winger joins from Rennes for a club-record fee, believed to be in the region of \u20ac35m. The 21-year-old is understood to have signed a five-year contract. A major coup for Watford. Slaven Bilic has strengthened his attacking ranks. West Brom have paid Southampton a fee of \u00a34m for the striker, who has signed a two-year contract. The 30-year-old drops into the Championship after three-and-a-half seasons at St Mary\u2019s, in which he made 81 appearances and scored 20 goals. Mauricio Pochettino has his man. Tottenham have paid Fulham \u00a325m for the teenage defender, who can also play further forward. The 19-year-old has signed a five-year contract, with Spurs holding a one-year option to further extend his stay. That fee almost looks ... cheap. Cracking business, and Giovani Lo Celso is set to follow from Real Betis. Both have undergone medicals today. Signing of the summer? Here\u2019s a few to get you started: Two hours to go! All of the bluster has died of death in the last hour or so, more or less ever since that news of Andy Carroll returning to Newcastle, but here\u2019s the major bits and pieces that we are keeping an eye on before that 5pm deadline: \u2022 Sessegnon and Lo Celso to Tottenham \u2022 David Luiz and Kieran Tierney to Arsenal \u2022 Romelu Lukaku to seal Inter move \u2022 Leicester to sign \u20ac20m Dennis Praet \u2022 Brighton to sign Huddersfield\u2019s Aaron Mooy \u2022 Leeds to land Arsenal\u2019s Eddie Nketiah on loan \u2022 Charlie Austin to seal \u00a34m West Brom move Here\u2019s one that may have slipped under the radar .. Jason Puncheon has joined Pafos FC, with the Cypriot club describing the 33-year-old as \u201cthe greatest transfer\u201d in their history. Puncheon, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Huddersfield from Crystal Palace, blathered: \u201cI am honoured to be joining Pafos FC. I believe the club has big potential and I am happy to become a part of the team and will work hard to bring new successes.\u201d With John Bostock expected to join Nottingham Forest, indulge in Will Unwin\u2019s interview with him from a little while back. \u201cMaybe a few years ago I would feel worried and that I would need to prove myself, that I was this wonderkid but I don\u2019t need to prove any of that any more,\u201d Bostock says. Aaron Mooy\u2019s move to Brighton is edging closer. \u201cHe has qualities that I think will fit in well to our group,\u201d says Graham Potter. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be a good addition.\u201d Huddersfield set to lose a key cog. \u201cWe have to be honest, it was always going to be a difficult transfer window,\u201d says Jan Siewert. \u201cWe will always protect the club with everything we are doing. It\u2019s normal that players have wishes.\u201d Two hours or so to go until the window *checks notes* slams shut. Big news out of Tottenham ... 6ft1in defender Cameron Carter-Vickers has joined Stoke City on a season-long loan. There are more goings on in the Championship too, with Nottingham Forest busying themselves. John Bostock is close to a move, as is the defender Chema Rodriguez. Luke Steele has departed on loan for Millwall, who needed to strengthen in goal following injury to Frank Fielding. Forest appear to be stockpiling, contrary to Sabri Lamouchi\u2019s wishes. Last week he said working with 29-31 first-team players was \u201cimpossible\u201d. Since then they have added Brice Samba and Carl Jenkinson, with seemingly more signings to follow. Lukewarm done deal klaxon! Grady Diangana has joined West Brom on a season-long loan from West Ham. \u201cWest Brom got a serious player on their hands,\u201d says Declan Rice. A glowing endorsement. Elsewhere, Kalvin Phillips is set to sit down with the powers that be at Leeds with a view to signing a new deal. Phillips is Leeds\u2019 midfield bouncer, a monstrous presence: This is loosely transfer-related ... Ravel Morrison has weighed in with his two pennies\u2019 worth on Saido Berahino, who has taken a public hammering ahead of a move to Zulte Waregem following his release from Stoke. Glen Johnson accused Berahino of having a \u201cvendetta\u201d and for \u201calways going against the grain\u201d: Let\u2019s go to ... Burnley. Sean Dyche has been speaking and says Danny Drinkwater on a season-long loan is a \u201cmaybe\u201d. Nahki Wells could be heading out the door, also on loan, with Championship clubs queuing round the block for the striker, with QPR poised to re-sign the forward. Meanwhile, Charlie Austin\u2019s move to West Brom is edging closer. They\u2019re dotting the i\u2019s and crossing the t\u2019s on a \u00a34m deal. That\u2019s as big a plus for Southampton as it is West Brom. I\u2019m going to take a break. It\u2019s time for Ben Fisher to take over. All leave cancelled in the medical department at Newcastle United; Andy Carroll has agreed a one year contract. The Angel of the North has returned. It appears it will be a heavily incentivised deal containing a significant pay as you play element to supplement the basic wage. Reading\u2019s Danny Loader is having a medical at Wolves. Ben Fisher profiled the forward here earlier this summer. Jurgen Klopp is yet to decide if Sadio Mane will be involved against Norwich on Friday - the Liverpool forward hasn\u2019t had much of a break after playing for Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations this summer. \u201cHe only had two weeks off so he didn\u2019t lose a lot which is the good news and he looks fit,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWednesday was the first session and now he\u2019s been with the team for the first time and he\u2019s in good spirits. He\u2019s an option but we will see.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s Brazilian winger Kenedy appears to be heading to Reading on loan. He spent last year at Newcastle, but now he\u2019s dropping into the Championship. Wilfried Zaha\u2019s future remains up in the air as the final hours of the transfer window approach, although it seems likely he will now stay at Crystal Palace. Zaha handed in a transfer request on Wednesday after Everton\u2019s bid of \u00a370m plus James McCarthy on a permanent deal and Cenk Tosun on loan was rejected by Palace, with sources saying the deal was dead. But after a furious Zaha handed in a transfer request, it is understood Palace considered reviving the move and began searching for replacements, with Rennes winger Ismaila Sarr and CSKA Moscow striker Fyodor Chalov their preferred targets. But with not much time remaining to secure those deals, it appears at this stage that the Ivory Coast forward will not leave Selhurst Park because no club has matched Palace\u2019s valuation. There have been reports that he had missed training this morning, although it is understood that he was in the gym preparing for Saturday\u2019s first game of the season - against Everton. \u201cI have no horse in this race at all ( I dont think Colchester could afford him, however deadly he would be in league 2)... but for some reason I hope it works out for Andy Carroll,\u201d Steve Wiles says. \u201cGoing home, heading in a few goals for Steve Bruce, talk of an England call up then a knee-knack in April. Ok, i realise that might not be a fairy tale ending but I\u2019d love to see one last dangerous season from a guy who seems to be a true professional but was accidentally born 20 years too late.\u201d We should soon know whether Newcastle\u2019s physio team will be working overtime this season as the club really need to make up their mind about Andy Carroll by the end of the day. Considering the former West Ham striker - who, to Alan Pardew\u2019s horror, departed Newcastle for Liverpool for \u00a335m on transfer deadline day January 2011 - is currently a free agent that may seem puzzling but Premier League rules preclude Steve Bruce leaving any gaps in his 25 man squad which must be submitted to the ruling body tomorrow. So it\u2019s make your mind up time over Andy. He underwent ankle surgery earlier this year and is apparently recovering well but the club are trying to determine the likelihood of how many games he could potentially be match fit for between now and January. If, the 30-year-old stayed fit it could be an inspired move; at his best Carroll is unplayable and it is no surprise his situation was one of the first checked out by Bruce as soon as he moved into Rafa Benitez\u2019s old office. But it is, undeniably, a very big if ! Manuel Pellegrini has told reporters that West Ham will not be making any more signings. He\u2019s happy with his squad and believes he has two players for every position. The word is that Wilfried Zaha has not trained with Crystal Palace today. Maybe Manchester United or Tottenham should think about going for him. Tottenham\u2019s move for Paulo Dybala has broken down over image rights issues. Oh dear. What a world: a transfer breaking down because of image rights. What\u2019s going to happen to Dybala this season? He\u2019s a brilliant player but it\u2019s said that Maurizio Sarri won\u2019t play him unless he pretends to be Jorginho. Sky are showing images of Romelu Lukaku leaning out of a window and giving a thumbs up to cheering Inter fans. He\u2019ll be crowdsurfing soon. Chris Wilder, Sheffield United\u2019s manager, hopes to bring in a central midfielder before the day\u2019s out. \u201cWe are trying to add a central midfield player to the group and if we do I\u2019ll be delighted with what we\u2019ve done so far, in terms of what I was given at the back end of last season and how we have gone about it in structure, the age and the ambition and desire of the players we have brought in \u201cI should imagine, like every manager up and down the country, we are close but things can change pretty quickly. But we are just banging away and seeing if we can do something before the window closes. \u201cIt is amazing how it comes down to these last few hours. We did a lot of our work pretty early, which I\u2019m delighted with, but if we can get one more I\u2019ll be delighted. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn\u2019t then we go with the group we\u2019ve got. It could be an exciting last few hours and one deal sparks other deals. We are waiting for a few things to happen and if they do I will be delighted because we\u2019ve got our eyes on some targets that are going to make us better. \u201cAs regards going out, there\u2019s a couple of bits of interest in Mark Duffy and Leon Clarke, who are established Championship players, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they went by the close of play.\u201d Bad news for Tottenham - and potentially for Christian Eriksen\u2019s hopes of going to Real Madrid. Are you sitting down? I hear that there are doubts over Andy Carroll\u2019s fitness. However a source tells me that it could be a good gamble for Newcastle to bring the striker home if they can agree a good deal with him. Hello all. Andy Carroll to Newcastle. Need I say more? Shall we just end the blog here? This, after all, is all the summer\u2019s been building up to. Well, well, well! A few murmurings in the north east that Newcastle could seek out Andy Carroll and offer the 30-year-old striker an incentivised pay-packet. Carroll, as you\u2019d expect, is reportedly keen on a move back home. With that, here\u2019s colleague Jacob Steinberg, who will steer you through the next couple of hours: Done deal klaxon! Brighton have bagged the Paris Saint-Germain teenager Romaric Yapi. The 19-year-old defender has signed a one-year deal, with a one-year extension option for the club, and he will initially link up with Brighton\u2019s Under-23 squad. And Aaron Mooy could yet follow before 5 o\u2019clock. \u201cConcerned Palace fan here struggling to concentrate on work \u2026 any update on Zaha?\u201d asks Jack Dunn. The short of it is Zaha has handed in a transfer request after Crystal Palace rejected Everton\u2019s latest offer and the club are adamant they will not accept less than \u00a3100m for the Ivory Coast forward. It is difficult to envisage Everton, or anyone else for that matter, getting anywhere near that kind of fee before 5pm. Palace are certainly digging their heels in. \u201cHarry Maguire \u00a372 million better then David Luiz,\u201d tweets John Goodman. \u201cReally?\u201d It\u2019s a good point, although age is such a big factor in the value of players these days \u2013 Maguire is six years younger. The fact Maguire is English hikes up his price too. Brighton paid Bristol City \u00a320m for Adam Webster, who has not played a second of Premier League football, while James Tarkowski and Lewis Dunk \u2013 neither of whom are expected to depart on deadline day \u2013 are valued in excess of \u00a340m. Then there\u2019s Nathan Ake, who Bournemouth value at north of \u00a375m. Any deadline day thoughts? Who is the signing of the summer? Which player has moved under the radar? Keep all of your thoughts coming. In the meantime, here are some of the major deals to keep an eye on throughout the day, with much more drama to come: \u2022 Sessegnon, Lo Celso and Dybala to Tottenham \u2022 David Luiz and Kieran Tierney to Arsenal \u2022 Romelu Lukaku to seal Inter move \u2022 Leicester to sign \u20ac20m Dennis Praet \u2022 Brighton to sign Huddersfield\u2019s Aaron Mooy \u2022 Leeds to land Arsenal\u2019s Eddie Nketiah on loan \u2022 Charlie Austin to swap Southampton for West Brom Newcastle have now spent more than \u00a360m this summer, with Krafth following Joelinton, Allan Saint-Maximin and Jetro Williams through the door. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the unrest, I\u2019ve got to be honest,\u201d the midfielder, Matt Ritchie, recently said. \u201cThe club\u2019s gone out, spent money. We\u2019re pushing, trying to compete with the teams we can compete with and you have to be real. To compete at the top of the Premier League now is mega money \u2013 I think the owner has been honest in his interviews in the press and said he can\u2019t go and compete with them.\u201d Done deal klaxon! Newcastle United have made the defender Emil Krafth their fourth summer signing. Fee of \u00a35m. The 25-year-old right-back, who helped Sweden reach the quarter-finals at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, has signed an initial four-year contract at St. James\u2019 Park. Steve Bruce has his man. With no end of excitement (and fear) swirling around at Tottenham, indulge in our Spurs season preview: North London is a hive of activity: Giovani Lo Celso is in England, which is good news for Tottenham who have the Argentina midfielder booked in for a medical at Hotspur Way. And he is not the only one: Only Jarrod Bowen, Said Benrahma and Danny Loader remain, of the 10 players listed below ahead of the 5pm deadline. And Wolves are hot on Loader, the Reading teenager, having had several bids rebuffed. Dean Smith fancies reuniting with Benrahma but it remains to be seen whether Aston Villa return for him: Done (double) deal! Charlton Athletic have signed Sam Field and Jonathan Leko on season-long loan deals from West Bromwich Albion. Elsewhere in the Football League, Hull City are close to signing Wigan midfielder Leo da Silva Lopes. West Brom, meanwhile, are in advanced talks with Southampton over Charlie Austin. Several Championship clubs are eyeing a swoop for Sheffield United pair Mark Duffy and Leon Clarke, with neither given squad numbers by Chris Wilder, who wants to add a midfielder on loan before the deadline. \u201cIf Poch/Levy pull this off today with the three possibilities (which of course none of us believe they will),\u201d tweets Ben Duckworth, \u201cthe days of \u2018overachieving with meagre resources\u2019 will be long gone and the glorious pressure of expectation will be here. Bring it on!\u201d Tottenham are edging closer to deals for Real Betis midfielder Giovani Lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon, and the wheels are certainly in motion on a move for Paolo Dybala. But that one is not straightforward. Of Dybala, transfer guru Fabrizio Romano says: \u201cJuventus and Tottenham are trying to find the total agreement; still some problems between Dybala and Tottenham to be solved. Meeting today with agents and Juventus director too. Not an easy deal but talks ongoing.\u201d Dennis Praet is in the building at Leicester. A \u20ac20m move is close: A quick snippet out of the south coast: Brighton are confident of sealing a move for Huddersfield\u2019s Aaron Mooy. The 28-year-old Australia midfielder is set to sign on a one-year loan deal. Brighton had been keen to sign Mooy when he joined Huddersfield permanently from Manchester City two years ago but they finally appear to have got their man. Newcastle had also been linked. \u201cArsenal are getting a bargain with \u00a325 million for Tierney,\u201d emails Robbie Wardlaw. \u201cBrilliant going forward and a real old school no nonsense defender as well, something that\u2019s pretty rare with modern fullbacks. He\u2019s a massive upgrade on Kolasinac at left back and can also play centre half too.\u201d A couple more breaking-news nuggets: \u2022 Arsenal left-back Dom Thompson has joined Brentford \u2022 Bristol City have signed Bologna midfielder Adam Nagy \u2022 Wolves\u2019s latest bid for Danny Loader has been rebuffed \u2022 Nathan Redmond has signed a new four-year deal \u2022 Sheffield Wednesday have snapped up Massimo Luongo \u201cInteresting to see what Everton, the club I have followed for 52 years, do today,\u201d emails Jonathan Tasker. \u201cCould someone please tell the club that we urgently need a centre half? I\u2019d take Fikayo Tomori, this season\u2019s Kurt Zouma.\u201d Everton are said to be in for Manchester United\u2019s Marcos Rojo, while they had a \u00a330m bid for Alex Iwobi knocked back by Arsenal. As for Wilfried Zaha? An interesting seven hours or so lie ahead. Newcastle\u2019s Jacob Murphy is en route to South Yorkshire for a medical after agreeing a season long loan with Sheffield Wednesday. The former Norwich winger \u2013 and twin brother of Josh Murphy \u2013 cost Rafa Ben\u00edtez \u00a312m but struggled to establish himself on Tyneside and has now been deemed surplus to requirements as Steve Bruce attempts to trim a slightly overblown squad. Big news out of Aston Villa .. John McGinn has signed a new five-year deal at the club. They have signed 12 players since promotion but that could be Villa\u2019s best business to date this summer. The Villa chief executive, Christian Purslow, says: \u201cWe are delighted to secure John\u2019s services for the long term at Aston Villa. He is the type of player Dean Smith and our ownership group want to build our club around: young, determined, athletic, technically-gifted and passionate about winning.\u201d A done deal at Leeds United! Marcelo Bielsa has snapped up the France Under-20 goalkeeper Illan Meslier on a season-long loan. But Leeds are not finished there, with another youngster, Eddie Nketiah, travelling north from London to seal a loan switch from Arsenal. Nketiah had no shortage of suitors, Bristol City and Swansea City had been very keen, but the Bielsa factor \u2013 and the director of football Victor Orta\u2019s relationship with Unai Emery, appears to have got the move over the line. Nketiah will replace Kemar Roofe, who has joined Anderlecht. Daniel Levy has a very busy afternoon on his hands. Tottenham Hotspur have plenty of irons in the fire, with Giovani Lo Celso, Ryan Sessegnon and Paulo Dybala all possible incomings. The Lo Celso deal is reported to be much further down the line, with a medical planned, while the Dybala deal is more complex. Josh Onomah is expected to head to Fulham as a makeweight in that Sessegnon deal. Another little Spurs nugget is the defender Cameron Carter-Vickers is heading out on loan, to the Championship with Stoke City. Tanguy Ndombele and Jack Clarke, who will spend the season on loan at Leeds, are Tottenham\u2019s only summer signings to date. But that could change very soon. \u201cI\u2019d love to know who you think was the most sensible Premier League transfer this season \u2013 so far,\u201d emails Nicholas Rixon. Crystal Palace nabbing Victor Camarasa, who was outstanding for Cardiff last season, on a season-long loan seems very shrewd business, while Che Adams looks an absolute steal for \u00a315m. Southampton will be feeling very good about that one. Ravel Morrison could go either way at Sheffield United but, on a free transfer, it could prove a coup. Reports in Italy suggest Martin Skrtel is on the radar of Atalanta. A meeting between the club and the player\u2019s agent is said to have been penned in for this morning. A few other bits and pieces doing the rounds in Europe: Daniele Rugani has been linked with a \u00a330m move to Wolves from Juventus; Genk\u2019s Sander Berge is attracting Premier League interest; Norwich City supposedly like the look of Lorient forward Alexis Claude-Maurice and Napoli want \u00a323m for Elseid Hysaj. West Ham broke their transfer record to sign Sebastien Haller last month, but they were still in the market for another striker and have landed one after buying Albian Ajeti from FC Basel. Ajeti is a 22-year-old Swiss striker and he scored 15 goals last season. West Ham beat off interest from West Brom and he should provide useful back-up for Haller. Speaking of West Brom, I am told Grady Diangana is likely to join them on loan. The winger broke into West Ham\u2019s first team last season but he could do with a year in the Championship. West Brom\u2019s manager, by the way? Slaven Bilic, of course. He\u2019s using his links with West Ham to his advantage. Meanwhile West Brom are loaning young midfielder Sam Field to Charlton, who have also nabbed West Ham midfielder Josh Cullen. Does Cullen\u2019s exit mean West Ham will sign another midfielder? They\u2019re light in the middle. Maybe \u2013 word is they could make a move if something comes up. But there\u2019s nothing in the pipeline right now and links with Stuttgart\u2019s Santiago Ascacibar are being dismissed at the moment. A couple of deals that might have slipped under the radar: \u2022 George Puscas, the Romania Under-21 striker who scored against England this summer, has joined Reading from Internazionale \u2022 Crystal Palace have signed Victor Camarasa on a season-long loan, while James McCarthy joins permanently from Everton \u2022 Everton have signed France defender Djibril Sidibe on a season-long loan from Monaco, Marco Silva\u2019s sixth summer signing \u2022 Scott Hogan has joined Stoke on loan from Aston Villa \u2022 Southampton\u2019s Josh Sims joins NY Red Bulls on loan \u201cAs an Arsenal fan, I\u2019m a bit worried we might see a makeshift defence of Maitland-Niles, Mustafi, David Luiz and Monreal at Anfield in our third game of the season,\u201d emails Admir Pajic. \u201cOn that day we also might see the first case of a manager instructing his central defenders to man-mark each other. That being said, Arsenal have done their job pretty well this summer and we can\u2019t wait to see our new Ivorian winger from Lille making his debut at St James Park on the opening day because that can only end up well, right?\u201d Kieran Tierney\u2019s \u00a325m move is expected to be rubber-stamped shortly, while the 20-year-old striker Eddie Nketiah is heading out on loan. Leeds look to have won that race. Do keep the emails and tweets coming. Good morning! And here\u2019s some box-fresh breaking news to get us up and running: West Ham United have signed Switzerland striker Albian Ajeti on a four-year contract. Staying in the forward department, Southampton are hopeful of offloading Charlie Austin on a permanent deal before the 5pm deadline. West Bromwich Albion are seemingly in pole position, but other Championship clubs are sniffing around. His wages could prove a stumbling block. Right, my time is up. A proper writer, in Ben Fisher, will take over. It\u2019s been a blast. Be nice to him. Gary Neville doesn\u2019t appear to be too upset that Lukaku is leaving \u2026 And for those of you who missed last night\u2019s news that Romelu Lukaku is off to Inter, here is the news by Fabrizio Romano More good news for Arsenal fans, Mesut is staying! And here is today\u2019s Rumour Mill, by Barry Glendenning It could well be happening. Arsenal and Chelsea have agreed an \u00a38m deal for David Luiz to join the Gunners. This, as far as unexpected transfers, is a cracker as well. And here are the thoughts of an Arsenal fan (Harry Bowie) this sunny morning Rather concerning if Arsenal end up having brought in Luiz as a replacement for Kosci. Old for a little bit less old, fairly reliable for quite less reliable. Hopefully Holding will be back soon to take up place alongside Sokratis. Other than that, I think Arsenal have gone above and beyond in the transfer market, in terms of the fans\u2019 expectations. Only problem is, they may have gone above and beyond in the wrong direction... Think we now just need to make sure Ozil doesn\u2019t head off to DC! (And hope that a move for some stunningly good youthful CB, that won\u2019t be sent back on loan, materialises!) Gareth Evans gets in touch Can I just offer a quick clenched fist of solidarity to my fellow Spurs fans awaiting the crushing disappointment of 5.01pm please. Thinking back to AVB staying in his office as Levy tried and failed to get Moutinho done always looms large when we\u2019re \u2018close\u2019 to a signing on Deadline Day. And the final two updates (for now) from our colleagues at Get French Football News are here Leeds United will shortly announce the arrival of 19-year-old goalkeeper Illan Meslier on loan with an option to buy from Ligue 2 side FC Lorient. Norwich City are waiting to hear from 21-year-old Lorient attacking midfielder Alexis Claude Maurice, after having a \u20ac16.5m bid okayed in principle by the Ligue 2 club. Player had preferred to stay in France this summer. One to watch.\u201d L\u2019\u00c9quipe also report that Aston Villa\u2019s \u20ac16m bid for Said Benrahma remains on the table, with multiple French outlets reporting an interest from Brentford in Amiens attacking midfielder Saman Ghoddos. Speaking of Crystal Palace, L\u2019\u00c9quipe inform us all this morning that they had a bid for Marseille midfielder Morgan Sanson rebuffed last week. The 24-year-old\u2019s name is associated in French press with Everton today after the Toffees were forced to abandon their pursuit of Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 (Watford) And now a series of updates from our excellent friends at Get French Football News starting with Isma\u00efla Sarr is a name to watch for Premier League clubs today. Crystal Palace are understood to have put in a bid yesterday for the Senegalese winger, while Watford continue to negotiate with Rennes. Kevin Wilson gets in touch (and I have to say I\u2019d forgotten that Matteo Darmian was still there) Man Utd need to spend some time trying to ship players out. Two of Jones, Smalling, Bailly, Rojo and Darmian should be leaving - in the case of the last three, they might find European takers later on. I think they\u2019re also light a CM as well as someone who can play wide right/up top. I don\u2019t think anyone is excited about an even more slow and ponderous Matic than usual. I have to say that \u00a38m for David Luiz sounds like a bargain. True, he has the odd mistake in him but he can be influential and, at his best, a magnificent centre-back. And if you are faced with a choice of having Mustafi or David Luiz in your team then it surely has to be the Brazilian. Still, he is no Upamecano. Well, talking about David Luiz. Here we go! I have to say that David Luiz possibly going to Arsenal is my favourite story of the transfer window so far. That and Radja Nainggolan to Cagliari. Much prefer a \u201cout of the blue\u201d transfer rather than one that has been dragging on for ages (no offence Joao Cancelo and Danilo). https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/david-luiz-hoping-to-join-arsenal-after-sitting-out-chelsea-training Good point here from young Adam Will Manchester United sign someone today. Looks difficult. Having ended their interest in Paulo Dybala and Christian Eriksen they are now going for Mario Mandzukic. But it won\u2019t be easy. Jonathan Bennett gets in touch via email to say: Though I appreciate that it helps teams with their preparation, surely moving the deadline to the start of the Premier League season severely disadvantages English clubs? European clubs can quote a higher price to PL teams, safe in the knowledge that if, for example, Manchester United aren\u2019t willing to splash out \u00a3200 million on Nacho, Real Madrid still have several weeks to flog him to another mug for a lower fee. What, Premier League clubs don\u2019t actually care about having even more reckless and inflated spending? Oh. Didn\u2019t realise Scott Hogan was on the move? Well, then this transfer interactive is the place to go. Has got all 1,338 deals including clubs in the top five leagues in Europe so far (OK, we might have missed one or two but Niall McVeigh promises me that we are pretty much up to date). It really is a magnificent tool And here is Romelu Lukaku arriving in Milan with more than 200 Inter fans waiting for him at 2am. That would make me feel wanted at least \u2026 And Spurs are doing their business comparatively early this summer (well, in fact, they haven\u2019t been doing much business over the last few windows). Either way, they are not about to wait until 4.59pm to conclude any deals with Ryan Sessegnon AND Giovani Lo Celso on their way to Enfield to have medicals already. Well, good morning everyone and welcome to our transfer deadline day live blog (although don\u2019t worry, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and many other countries will be wheeling and dealing until early September). However, here in the UK it is the final day for Premier League and Championship clubs to conclude their business. Good morning. Welcome to our Premier League summer transfer window deadline day blog. The window slams shut at 5pm BST and we plan to keep you up to speed with all the gossip, news and moves and clubs scramble for new recruits before the big kick off in England this weekend. What can we expect to happen today? Crystal Palace are aiming to receive a fee above \u00a3100m for Wilfried Zaha, who is hoping to earn a move to Europe. Philippe Coutinho has attracted some interest in the Premier League but is not too keen on coming back from Barcelona. Christian Eriksen would rather depart the Premier League for Spain, which Manchester United are aware of, but is without a concrete offer to take him to LaLiga. Spurs and Real Betis have agreed a fee for Giovani Lo Celso so now it is down to agreeing personal terms before 5pm. Manchester United have accepted Internazionale\u2019s \u00a370m offer for Romelu Lukaku who has wandered off to Belgium. It came out of the blue on Wednesday that David Luiz is wanted by Arsenal but the Brazilian is keen on the move, even missing Chelsea training to show his eagerness. Oh .... and Manchester City might sign Scott Carson.",

Money came in dribs and drabs and Newstart was adjusted accordingly. But the gap between earning money and declaring it, and actually getting the money in my account, could be dangerously wide. This gap would leave me exposed, sometimes with $70 a week to live on, while I chased rich and powerful companies for small, unpaid invoices.</p> <p>It was humiliating to see, after repeated requests to be paid from one big media company, that I was accidentally copied into an email about the payment and how I was \u201cpestering\u201d them.</p> <p>The email said \u201cdesperate vendor\u201d in the subject line. I was the desperate vendor.</p> <p>A month or so of this and I started waking every single morning between the hours of 2am and 4am and thinking obsessively about money.</p> <p>This wakefulness was pure anxiety and what I was doing in my head were tiny sums with tiny pieces of money. I\u2019d check my bank account and if nothing had come in overnight, I\u2019d start the process of doing the maths. Could I afford that day\u2019s tram fare, and what about the friend\u2019s birthday party in the nice restaurant, and could I say yes to a lunch but eat something first and just have a water?</p> <p>Many of my friends\u2019 careers were booming, and they were moving into jobs that paid serious money. The wine at dinner parties became more expensive, the restaurants pricier. Sometimes friends paid for me, sometimes I borrowed money, but there was no way around it, a night with my friends could wipe me out financially for a week or more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/14/my-supermarket-sweep-hell-how-a-visa-scam-ruined-my-holiday\">My Supermarket Sweep hell: how a visa scam ruined my holiday | Brigid Delaney's diary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the most isolating things about being on Newstart was being priced out of my social group. Before I lost my job I was earning $100,000. After on Newstart and bits and pieces, it was around $27,000. I wore rich person\u2019s clothes while walking everywhere because I couldn\u2019t afford the tram.</p> <p>Other times I\u2019d be offered travel assignments in luxury resorts. I didn\u2019t have enough money to get to the airport, but once I landed I\u2019d find myself in, say, the Philippines, in resorts where I\u2019d have my own villa, personal butler and private pool, dining on mineral water flown in from a glacier in Finland and eating little miniature bits of delicate raw foods that contained the precise amount of micronutrients the human body needs, sampling spa treatments worth thousands of dollars, while lying in the warm dark under the stars having a Four Hand Under The Stars massage, all the while my mind whirring in a ceaseless panic, doing the sums about how I was going to pay this month\u2019s rent back home.</p> <p>Being a poor person in a rich person\u2019s world reframed everything. If you are poor you only usually enter these gilded worlds as a servant of the rich. And the servants were everywhere, hidden, almost, in plain sight \u2013 from the Filipino groundsman who would stop sweeping when a guest walked past and avert his eyes, and incline his head slightly in a bow \u2013 to the casual tutor at the wealthy university who earns $12,600 a year and marks papers late at night in the cafe because she cannot afford the winter heating bill.</p> <p>If you are rich you do not even see the servants, but you get to experience the frictionless existence that these people help create for you.</p> <p>I was one of the lucky ones. I had a supportive network of friends and family and was able to get back on my feet within six months and return to the full-time workforce.

      "bodyText": "The last time I was on Newstart, it was when the probationary period of a big, posh new job wasn\u2019t extended. This news, delivered just after my colleagues had exchanged Kris Kringle and departed for Christmas break was as unexpected and disorienting as the mid-December rain. I stood out the front of the suburban office park with all my things thrown in a now sodden cardboard box and thought about the line that\u2019s always there, but only visible to some. Less than 20 minutes after losing my job, it was becoming visible to me now \u2013 like a lemon juice ink drawing emerging with the application of heat and a flame. The line is the thing that separates those with good financial padding, who might not think much about the $30 taxi or the unexpected bill, or $70 meal in a restaurant or putting a round of drinks on their cards \u2013 and those who are fearful when the bill comes, when the groceries are rung up, when opening the mail. On the other side of that line there are no shock absorbers. And of course, the journey is more jarring and perilous. That to me is the story of Newstart. *** Over the next six months on Newstart, I got bits of teaching work at a university and did freelance assignments, but I was caught in the currents of underpaid, intermittent and casual work. Money came in dribs and drabs and Newstart was adjusted accordingly. But the gap between earning money and declaring it, and actually getting the money in my account, could be dangerously wide. This gap would leave me exposed, sometimes with $70 a week to live on, while I chased rich and powerful companies for small, unpaid invoices. It was humiliating to see, after repeated requests to be paid from one big media company, that I was accidentally copied into an email about the payment and how I was \u201cpestering\u201d them. The email said \u201cdesperate vendor\u201d in the subject line. I was the desperate vendor. A month or so of this and I started waking every single morning between the hours of 2am and 4am and thinking obsessively about money. This wakefulness was pure anxiety and what I was doing in my head were tiny sums with tiny pieces of money. I\u2019d check my bank account and if nothing had come in overnight, I\u2019d start the process of doing the maths. Could I afford that day\u2019s tram fare, and what about the friend\u2019s birthday party in the nice restaurant, and could I say yes to a lunch but eat something first and just have a water? Many of my friends\u2019 careers were booming, and they were moving into jobs that paid serious money. The wine at dinner parties became more expensive, the restaurants pricier. Sometimes friends paid for me, sometimes I borrowed money, but there was no way around it, a night with my friends could wipe me out financially for a week or more. One of the most isolating things about being on Newstart was being priced out of my social group. Before I lost my job I was earning $100,000. After on Newstart and bits and pieces, it was around $27,000. I wore rich person\u2019s clothes while walking everywhere because I couldn\u2019t afford the tram. Other times I\u2019d be offered travel assignments in luxury resorts. I didn\u2019t have enough money to get to the airport, but once I landed I\u2019d find myself in, say, the Philippines, in resorts where I\u2019d have my own villa, personal butler and private pool, dining on mineral water flown in from a glacier in Finland and eating little miniature bits of delicate raw foods that contained the precise amount of micronutrients the human body needs, sampling spa treatments worth thousands of dollars, while lying in the warm dark under the stars having a Four Hand Under The Stars massage, all the while my mind whirring in a ceaseless panic, doing the sums about how I was going to pay this month\u2019s rent back home. Being a poor person in a rich person\u2019s world reframed everything. If you are poor you only usually enter these gilded worlds as a servant of the rich. And the servants were everywhere, hidden, almost, in plain sight \u2013 from the Filipino groundsman who would stop sweeping when a guest walked past and avert his eyes, and incline his head slightly in a bow \u2013 to the casual tutor at the wealthy university who earns $12,600 a year and marks papers late at night in the cafe because she cannot afford the winter heating bill. If you are rich you do not even see the servants, but you get to experience the frictionless existence that these people help create for you. I was one of the lucky ones. I had a supportive network of friends and family and was able to get back on my feet within six months and return to the full-time workforce. But the forms and the queues and the mutual obligation and the job network provider appointments and the mountains of mail received each week advising of mandatory meetings \u2013 and the overlay of anxiety about money \u2013 is not something quickly forgotten. As for the poor \u2013 one of the worst things about being poor, and by extension being on Newstart \u2013 is the lack of freedom. Not just the lack of freedom to travel, or enjoy socialising with your friends, but the mental freedom. As soon as you get on Newstart, your mind isn\u2019t free. It\u2019s anxious and busy working out how to survive. It\u2019s doing tiny sums with tiny bits of money. It\u2019s going right down to the decimal point. To have money is to be free, to have that space in your head freed up for other things: thinking, dreaming, enjoying your life, planning for your future, surrendering under the canopy of palms to the four-hand massage and thinking of nothing, because you don\u2019t have a care in the world. We take it for granted and do not appreciate that others have their headspace shrunk by poverty and the necessities of survival. In this respect the failure to increase Newstart is not merely a policy failure \u2013 nor is it just a moral failure \u2013 but an epic failure of imagination.

Like HIV, there is no cure. Like HIV, the virus causes potentially fatal complications but unlike HIV it takes much longer for symptoms to appear. Some people carry the virus for 30 years before chronic complications appear. Five to 10% develop a rapidly fatal form of leukaemia \u2013 nearly all of those will die within 12 months of diagnosis. Other life-threatening complications include kidney failure, lung disease, inflammation of the spinal cord leading to paralysis and other infections. The higher the viral load in the bloodstream, the more likely serious the symptoms.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who\u2019s at risk?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>HTLV-1 infects up to 20 million people worldwide. It\u2019s endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, South America, Papua New Guinea, Japan and central Australia, which has the highest transmission rate in the world. Essentially, once it has taken hold in an area, it is impossible to eradicate.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why isn\u2019t there a vaccine?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>HTLV-1 was discovered in te 1980. It was eclipsed in scientific interest by the 1984 discovery of HIV, which caused a global epidemic. Possibly as a result, HTLV-1 has been neglected by the global research community. Testing, research and clinical treatment need to be conducted before any cure can be sought. Japan is most advanced in treatment. It has reduced the transmission rate over time by 80%, through mass testing, and is trialling drug treatments. In 2014, the Global Virus Network set up an HTLV-1 taskforce, led by experts from 11 countries, to help speed up the development of drug treatments and vaccination, and educate the general public.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Following that reporting, the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, announced an $8m taskforce to look at HTLV-1 and other communicable diseases in remote communities, and has since announced a $4.5m longitudinal study to work out exactly how widespread \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/28/world-experts-call-for-australia-to-act-on-devastating-htlv-1-virus\">and how dangerous</a> \u2013 the virus is.</p> \n<p>The HTLV-1 taskforce is led by Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, and the Central Australian Academic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/health\">Health</a> Sciences Centre (CAAHSC).

It funds Quinn Emanuel\u2019s case against failed engineering company RCR Tomlinson, which is currently before the New South Wales supreme court, and its case against financial services group AMP over losses to shareholders caused by the company\u2019s disastrous performance at last year\u2019s banking royal commission. Quinn Emanuel lost a \u201cbeauty parade\u201d conducted by the court to decide which of five law firms would win the right to represent AMP shareholders, but is appealing the decision. In its report, Muddy Waters claimed the values Burford put on lawsuits it had funded but which had not finished were overblown and said it manipulated its figures to \u201ccreate what we believe is an egregiously misleading picture of its investment returns\u201d. It said Burford committed US$4.8m to fund the case against RCR Tomlinson, which then went into administration. \u201cAs a result, stockholders are likely to recover little to nothing from previously announced suits,\u201d Muddy Waters said. Scattini said the report \u201cdoesn\u2019t really concern us\u201d and Muddy Waters\u2019s characterisation of the RCR Tomlinson case was \u201cflat out wrong\u201d. \u201cThey say Burford has spent $4.7m on it but they haven\u2019t, nothing like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe claim is still ongoing and we\u2019ve got carriage of it.\u201d He said it did not matter that RCR Tomlinson had gone under. \u201cThere\u2019s insurance coverage behind the company and that will cover the damages,\u201d he said. \u201cBurford has always paid its bills. Even with what has happened to the share price they remain the largest litigation funder in the market by a country mile.\u201d Rival funder IMF Bentham, which saw its share price drop almost 2.4% on Thursday after the Muddy Waters report was published, distanced itself from Burford. The chief executive of IMF Bentham, Andrew Saker, told Guardian Australia his company used a much more conservative method to value lawsuits that were in progress than Burford\u2019s technique of giving them a market value. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone down the path of recognising our investments as intangibles and so they\u2019re carried at cost, we don\u2019t recognise unrealised gains,\u201d Saker said. He said it was \u201cdifficult to mark-to-market litigation assets\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has finalised his inner circle of advisers and is planning a series of brainstorming sessions for policy development that will ramp up by the year\u2019s end. Following the appointment of the national security expert Andrew Shearer as cabinet secretary this week, all of the key positions for Morrison\u2019s new team have now been finalised. The core group advising Morrison on policy and strategy on a daily basis include principal private secretary Yaron Finkelstein, chief of staff John Kunkel, head of media Andrew Carswell, and policy head Alex Caroly. Finkelstein\u2019s role is one of the most important in the office, with the well-regarded campaign operative having worked under the Howard government and at polling and strategy firm Crosby Textor. Morrison\u2019s right-hand man Kunkel, who was chief of staff to Morrison as treasurer, has a background in economic policy development and is another veteran of the Howard years. He also has experience in the mining sector having worked for Rio Tinto in government relations and as the deputy chief executive at the Minerals Council of Australia. Several key staff of Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott also remain in the prime minister\u2019s office, including Abbott\u2019s speechwriter Paul Ritchie and Turnbull\u2019s legal counsel Daniel Ward. Ward was credited with coming up with the idea of the postal plebiscite for same-sex marriage while working as an adviser in the office of the then attorney general George Brandis. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison has also surrounded himself with trusted policy advisers, including Jimmy Kipploks in defence, Michelle Chan on national security, Rachel Howard on education, and Brendan Pearson on trade. The former Reserve Bank of Australia economist Craig Evans and the Productivity Commission adviser Nico Louw provide the PM with economic policy advice. David Hughes, who has worked for Joe Hockey, Julie Bishop and Abbott, heads up strategy and research. Other key members of Morrison\u2019s office include his long-serving executive assistant, Latisha Wenlock, and head of programme, Sonja Gentile. Beyond his immediate staff Morrison relies heavily on the Western Australian MP Ben Morton, one of his closest confidantes in Canberra, who was appointed assistant minister to the prime minister and cabinet following the May election. Morton is heading up the government\u2019s deregulation agenda, and has been tasked with consulting with the business community about what changes are needed to improve productivity. Since the May election, which saw the Morrison government secure a surprise win, the PMO has conducted a series of policy brainstorming sessions on issues including plastic waste, veterans affairs and Indigenous suicide. A series of further policy planning sessions are planned across a range of departments, with the sessions attended by the relevant minister, departmental heads and Morrison\u2019s key advisers. The PMO is using the sessions to come up with a range of ideas to implement in this term of government, with the \u201cdeep dive\u201d aimed at coming up with pragmatic solutions to policy challenges. Now with his trusted team of advisers locked in, Morrison will be hoping to develop an agenda to see him through the 46th parliament, and one that keeps faith with voters who delivered the Coalition its unexpected victory.",

      "bodyText": "As a teenage rape survivor demanding justice battles for her life (Politician accused of rape expelled from BJP, 1 August), we are shocked and outraged at the Indian government\u2019s approach to violence against women and girls and its shielding of alleged perpetrators, particularly those who are leaders or close associates of the ruling BJP. Nothing has been learned from the brutal gang-rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kashmir in 2017, following which BJP ministers addressed protest marches in support of the rape-accused. This time the alleged perpetrator is a BJP member of the legislative assembly from Uttar Pradesh, Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who has denied the charge. Every stage in the survivor\u2019s struggle for justice has been dogged by threats and violence. Sengar\u2019s supporters allegedly brutally assaulted the girl\u2019s father, who was held in police custody and subsequently died. A key witness to these events also died mysteriously. Though Sengar has been awaiting trial in prison, the violence continues. The family claimed they received a series of dire threats from Sengar\u2019s associates. On 28 July a truck with its number plate obliterated with black paint hit a car carrying the rape survivor. Two aunts accompanying her were killed, and her lawyer seriously injured, while she remains critically ill. Amid growing protests the BJP finally expelled Sengar. Accusing BJP leaders and their associates of rape or murder seems enormously risky. The British government\u2019s current preoccupation with post-Brexit trade deals and home secretary Priti Patel\u2019s alleged admiration for those in power in India must not mean these blatant human rights violations are obscured.

      "body": "<p>If the shadow chancellor had planned a bombshell announcement that would create maximum havoc in the Scottish Labour party, it would look exactly like what he said this week. A second independence referendum is the hottest question in Scottish politics. Scottish Labour opposes it. Its leader Richard Leonard has repeatedly said that Labour would refuse permission to the Scottish nationalists to hold such a vote. Yet John McDonnell went to Edinburgh on Tuesday and, without consulting Mr Leonard, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/06/john-mcdonnell-open-to-second-scottish-independence-vote\" title=\"\">the exact opposite</a>.</p> <p>Speaking on the Fringe, Mr McDonnell said the issue was \u201cfor the Scottish parliament and the Scottish people to decide\u201d. If a second referendum was proposed, he said: \u201cThe Scottish parliament will come to a considered view and they will submit that to the government and the English parliament itself. If the Scottish people decide they want a referendum, that\u2019s for them.\u201d</p> <p>Mr McDonnell\u2019s words were explosive. The pledge not to block the second referendum that the SNP is actively promoting pulls the rug from under Mr Leonard. It flatly contradicts Labour manifesto policy in 2017. It flies in the face of the views of most Scottish Labour MPs and MSPs. It leaves Labour facing both ways on the issue of the day in Scotland. But Mr McDonnell does not seem to have misspoken. After <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17821430.leonard-meets-mcdonnell-amid-labour-row-independence-vote/\" title=\"\">a meeting with Mr Leonard</a>, at which the Scottish Labour leader insisted that the 2014 referendum was \u201ca once-in-a-generation vote\u201d and that a second referendum was \u201cunwanted and unnecessary\u201d, the shadow chancellor went right back out and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/john-mcdonnell-deepens-row-over-second-independence-poll\" title=\"\">repeated his comments</a> in a second interview. He added that his views were shared by Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>On Thursday the divisions deepened even further. In <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17824802.labour-msps-declare-war-corbyn-second-referendum/\" title=\"\">a remarkable statement</a>, with large implications, most of Labour\u2019s Holyrood MSPs said they would not accept a change of policy being foisted on them from London. Deploring Mr McDonnell\u2019s comments and giving Mr Leonard their backing, the MSPs said: \u201cLabour\u2019s position on Scotland\u2019s future is a decision for Scottish Labour, which the UK party must accept.\u201d</p> <p>Ordinarily, this might seem just another self-inflicted Labour mess. But Mr McDonnell picked this fight. There is only one plausible explanation of <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2019/08/john-mcdonnells-referendum-talk-big-gamble-labour\" title=\"\">his gamble</a>. It is that he has looked at current polling in Scotland and England and decided that Labour is not going to win an outright majority in the next UK general election, which could take place within weeks. As a result, he has concluded that, to function as a minority government, Labour must signal its willingness to strike <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/labours-uk-leadership-realised-winning-18859075\" title=\"\">a deal with the SNP</a>, even if the consequence is to make an idiot of Scottish Labour.</p> <p>This approach can draw some justification from the polls. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Kingdom_general_election_in_Scotland\" title=\"\">In 2017</a>, Labour got 27% of the vote in Scotland and won seven seats. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_(European_Parliament_constituency)\" title=\"\">But in May 2019</a>, Labour slumped to 9% in the European elections. In the most recent Scottish poll, it was <a href=\"http://whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/how-would-you-be-likely-to-vote-in-a-uk-general-election-asked-since-2017-gener#line\" title=\"\">on 17%</a>, leaving most of its Commons seats vulnerable to the SNP. In the wake of this week\u2019s row, Mr Corbyn will now be even further away from making the gains in Scotland that he needs. In the 2015 election, David Cameron scored heavily in England with the charge that a minority Labour government would be in the SNP\u2019s pocket. So it makes sense this time for Labour to get the issue into the public arena ahead of the election, and to make its terms \u2013 that it will not seek a pact but will not block another referendum \u2013 clear to the SNP.</p> <p>There are two further points of potential mitigation for Mr McDonnell\u2019s decision to stir things up so damagingly. One, put forward by Paul Sweeney MP on Thursday, is that a Corbyn government would demand <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17824107.labour-block-yes-no-question-independence/\" title=\"\">a multiple-choice referendum</a> in Scotland and include a fully federal UK option. That would be worth examining, if so. The other is that conceding a second Scottish referendum makes conceding a second vote on the EU easier. That too would be a bold move if it happened. Right now, though, these are mere conjectures. Those who are attracted by them would need to see concrete evidence before endorsing them. Evidence of that kind has been conspicuously absent from Labour announcements so far. For the moment, the important thing to remember is that what Mr McDonnell did this week is very much a sign of Labour weakness, not strength.</p>",

A second independence referendum is the hottest question in Scottish politics. Scottish Labour opposes it. Its leader Richard Leonard has repeatedly said that Labour would refuse permission to the Scottish nationalists to hold such a vote. Yet John McDonnell went to Edinburgh on Tuesday and, without consulting Mr Leonard, said the exact opposite. Speaking on the Fringe, Mr McDonnell said the issue was \u201cfor the Scottish parliament and the Scottish people to decide\u201d. If a second referendum was proposed, he said: \u201cThe Scottish parliament will come to a considered view and they will submit that to the government and the English parliament itself. If the Scottish people decide they want a referendum, that\u2019s for them.\u201d Mr McDonnell\u2019s words were explosive. The pledge not to block the second referendum that the SNP is actively promoting pulls the rug from under Mr Leonard. It flatly contradicts Labour manifesto policy in 2017. It flies in the face of the views of most Scottish Labour MPs and MSPs. It leaves Labour facing both ways on the issue of the day in Scotland. But Mr McDonnell does not seem to have misspoken. After a meeting with Mr Leonard, at which the Scottish Labour leader insisted that the 2014 referendum was \u201ca once-in-a-generation vote\u201d and that a second referendum was \u201cunwanted and unnecessary\u201d, the shadow chancellor went right back out and repeated his comments in a second interview. He added that his views were shared by Jeremy Corbyn. On Thursday the divisions deepened even further. In a remarkable statement, with large implications, most of Labour\u2019s Holyrood MSPs said they would not accept a change of policy being foisted on them from London. Deploring Mr McDonnell\u2019s comments and giving Mr Leonard their backing, the MSPs said: \u201cLabour\u2019s position on Scotland\u2019s future is a decision for Scottish Labour, which the UK party must accept.\u201d Ordinarily, this might seem just another self-inflicted Labour mess. But Mr McDonnell picked this fight. There is only one plausible explanation of his gamble. It is that he has looked at current polling in Scotland and England and decided that Labour is not going to win an outright majority in the next UK general election, which could take place within weeks. As a result, he has concluded that, to function as a minority government, Labour must signal its willingness to strike a deal with the SNP, even if the consequence is to make an idiot of Scottish Labour. This approach can draw some justification from the polls. In 2017, Labour got 27% of the vote in Scotland and won seven seats. But in May 2019, Labour slumped to 9% in the European elections. In the most recent Scottish poll, it was on 17%, leaving most of its Commons seats vulnerable to the SNP. In the wake of this week\u2019s row, Mr Corbyn will now be even further away from making the gains in Scotland that he needs. In the 2015 election, David Cameron scored heavily in England with the charge that a minority Labour government would be in the SNP\u2019s pocket. So it makes sense this time for Labour to get the issue into the public arena ahead of the election, and to make its terms \u2013 that it will not seek a pact but will not block another referendum \u2013 clear to the SNP. There are two further points of potential mitigation for Mr McDonnell\u2019s decision to stir things up so damagingly. One, put forward by Paul Sweeney MP on Thursday, is that a Corbyn government would demand a multiple-choice referendum in Scotland and include a fully federal UK option. That would be worth examining, if so. The other is that conceding a second Scottish referendum makes conceding a second vote on the EU easier. That too would be a bold move if it happened. Right now, though, these are mere conjectures. Those who are attracted by them would need to see concrete evidence before endorsing them. Evidence of that kind has been conspicuously absent from Labour announcements so far. For the moment, the important thing to remember is that what Mr McDonnell did this week is very much a sign of Labour weakness, not strength.",

      "body": "<p>Medical cannabis cannot be approved for use in children with severe epilepsy on the NHS because there is not enough evidence to prove it helps, a watchdog has ruled.</p> \n<p>The decision by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) dismayed campaigners and parents who said their children would suffer as a result.</p> \n<p>But they took some hope from a review by NHS England. Like Nice, it said more trials were needed but said the children\u2019s experiences on medicinal cannabis in the UK and abroad should be taken into account as evidence of how well the drug works.</p> \n<p>Last year the law was changed so that medicinal cannabis could be prescribed legally after the parents of Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell, who both have treatment-resistant epilepsy, publicly defied the authorities to bring cannabis oil into the UK.</p> \n<p>But doctors have been reluctant to prescribe cannabis-based medicines in the UK despite the rescheduling of the drug in November because of the lack of clinical trial evidence of its benefits and safety. Nice is calling for more traditional \u201cgold standard\u201d randomised controlled trials, comparing a group of people on medicinal cannabis with a similar group of people on other medication, to answer the crucial questions about safety and efficacy.</p> \n<p>At the same time, NHS England published its review of the barriers to access to medicinal cannabis for patients. It agreed more research was needed but, as campaigners have argued, it suggested it should be possible to include evidence from the experiences of children and young adults already taking cannabis-based medicines.</p> \n<p>It also recommended a network of children\u2019s doctors to be set up to collect evidence and advice on difficult cases.

      "bodyText": "Medical cannabis cannot be approved for use in children with severe epilepsy on the NHS because there is not enough evidence to prove it helps, a watchdog has ruled. The decision by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) dismayed campaigners and parents who said their children would suffer as a result. But they took some hope from a review by NHS England. Like Nice, it said more trials were needed but said the children\u2019s experiences on medicinal cannabis in the UK and abroad should be taken into account as evidence of how well the drug works. Last year the law was changed so that medicinal cannabis could be prescribed legally after the parents of Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell, who both have treatment-resistant epilepsy, publicly defied the authorities to bring cannabis oil into the UK. But doctors have been reluctant to prescribe cannabis-based medicines in the UK despite the rescheduling of the drug in November because of the lack of clinical trial evidence of its benefits and safety. Nice is calling for more traditional \u201cgold standard\u201d randomised controlled trials, comparing a group of people on medicinal cannabis with a similar group of people on other medication, to answer the crucial questions about safety and efficacy. At the same time, NHS England published its review of the barriers to access to medicinal cannabis for patients. It agreed more research was needed but, as campaigners have argued, it suggested it should be possible to include evidence from the experiences of children and young adults already taking cannabis-based medicines. It also recommended a network of children\u2019s doctors to be set up to collect evidence and advice on difficult cases. Many doctors were unwilling to prescribe medicinal cannabis, it said, worried about the possible long-term effects on the brain particularly from longer term exposure to THC, the psychoactive constituent in cannabis responsible for \u201chighs\u201d. THC (delta-9-Tetrahydracannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol) are the two constituents that have been most investigated for their medicinal value. Nice also turned down Sativex, a cannabis-based medicine developed for multiple sclerosis, on the grounds that the price was too high. It said the drug was not cost-effective for the NHS and alternatives should be used instead. Another cannabis-based drug, nabilone, was recommended in the draft guidance as an add-on treatment for adults with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, but only if other conventional licensed medicines do not work. Prof Mike Barnes, the chair of the Medical Cannabis Clinicians Society, said Nice was wrong to want to assess medical cannabis on the basis of the same sort of trials used to approve conventional medicines. Barnes, who is medical director of a chain of private clinics using medicinal cannabis currently advertising to recruit more doctors, said it had \u201cfailed to take into account alternative, valid sources of evidence\u201d and he claimed the Nice committee was made up of people with negative views about cannabis. \u201cThose with positive views were excluded from the process,\u201d he said. On the other hand, he said, NHS England had produced \u201ca positive review that recognises the need for accepting different but valid evidence for the efficacy of cannabis as a medicine\u201d. Hannah Deacon, whose son Alfie Dingley is one of only two patients with an NHS prescription, said she was extremely disappointed with the Nice decision. \u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of people using cannabis-based medicines across the world and it\u2019s having an enormously positive impact on their health,\u201d she said. \u201cMany countries have legalised medical cannabis industries \u2013 America, Canada and other G7 countries \u2013 they see the evidence is good enough. The UK is insisting on reinventing the wheel for no reason and the people who are suffering are patients.\u201d She said she was supporting 20 families who were trying to get prescriptions from UK doctors and who could not afford to pay thousands of pounds to travel to Europe every month to get the medicine illegally. The MS Society also said it was bitterly disappointed. \u201cNice\u2019s refusal to recommend cannabis for pain and muscles spasms, or to fund Sativex on the NHS, means thousands of people with MS will continue to be denied an effective treatment,\u201d said Genevieve Edwards, the society\u2019s director of external affairs. \u201cMS is relentless, painful and disabling and yet not a single person with MS has benefited from medicinal cannabis being legalised nine months ago.

      "bodyText": "Carmelo Anthony, the only ever three-time Olympic gold medalist in men\u2019s basketball, expressed interest in playing for the under-strength United States team at next month\u2019s Fiba World Cup, but was turned away by USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo. Even with the NBA\u2019s biggest American stars having passed on national team duty with the 2020 Olympics on the horizon, Colangelo said Anthony was never considered despite overtures made through his representation. \u201cI love Carmelo,\u201d Colangelo told SI.com. \u201cHe made a great contribution. He was a very good international player. But for where we are and what we\u2019re doing, that conceivably could have been a distraction. I understand why the request was made. He\u2019s trying to reestablish himself. I think that has to be done in the [NBA].\u201d The 35-year-old Anthony is a free agent after a tumultuous 16th NBA season where he was effectively dismissed by the Houston Rockets after 10 games before he was traded to the Chicago Bulls, who released him in February. But for all the complicated readings of his NBA career, Anthony has been a staple for the national team for the last decade and a half. One of only three men\u2019s basketball players to win four Olympic medals along with Gennady Volnov and Sergey Belov of the Soviet Union, Anthony earned his first back in 2004, when the USA lost three times and stumbled to a bronze that prompted a wholesale overhaul of the program under Colangelo. He has made 85 international appearances on 14 different USA Basketball teams in his career, averaging 14.9 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.4 assists while setting the US Olympic men\u2019s records for games played (31), total points (336), field goals made (113), field goals attempted (262), rebounds (125) and three-point field goals attempted (139), free throws made (53) and free throws attempted (71). Anthony had seemingly retired from international play after the Rio Games, when he shared an emotional embrace with teammate Kevin Durant and then-coach Mike Krzyzewski upon exiting the gold medal game against Serbia with two minutes remaining and victory secure. \u201cIt was a special moment for me,\u201d Anthony said afterward. \u201cI know this is the end. This is it for me.\u201d The process of building the United States team for this month\u2019s World Cup started last year with 35 players being added to the selection pool for the competition and next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics. Of those 35, 30 have already withdrawn from World Cup consideration for a variety of reasons including pending fatherhood, injury rehabilitation, filming a movie and preparing for the potential of a long NBA season. The World Cup will end on 15 September, meaning the US players, if they made the medal round, would get home about two weeks before NBA camps open. More than a dozen other names were officially added to the national team list along the way, with two of those players dropping out already as well. Others like New Orleans\u2019 JJ Redick were invited but declined even before being formally added to the list. Add it all up, and there have been at least 52 players under real consideration in the last year and a half. That doesn\u2019t include the select-teamers, others who were considered for that squad like New Orleans rookie and No 1 overall draft pick Zion Williamson (who declined) \u2013 or the 52 G-League players who went through the 12 qualifying games needed to get the US into the World Cup. \u201cThe focus has to be on who\u2019s here \u2013 not who\u2019s not here,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cA number of the young players in this group have a chance, a real chance, some of them to make this team, some of them to make an impact in the World Cup.\u201d",

Weirdest wellness trend: Love prescribes Lizzo, on stage at Glastonbury: wielding \u201clove (and her message of self-love) not so much as a device to eke out sadness and melancholy from our black and broken hearts, but to motivate and to arouse, to promote healing and spread undiluted, unbridled joy \u2026 Less a breath of fresh air than a raging reckless tornado of positive vibes.\u201d Sign us up.

Unlike previous instances, landline phones and cable TV have been cut off. A strict curfew also means people are unable to leave their homes during the day, while only limited movement has been allowed at night.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t recall a situation where there has been a total blackout of not only the two-way, multi-point communication systems that we are familiar with now \u2013 anything on the internet, WhatsApp etc \u2013 but also the one-direction communications like TV,\u201d Kaye said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a6ba9a1-6cf4-4c41-97ae-7af3f3152187\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Who controls Kashmir?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a>&nbsp;and Pakistan came into being in 1947.</p>\n    <p>Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \u2018line of control\u2019 based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades.

      "bodyText": "The unprecedented communications blackout imposed on Indian-administered Kashmir could signal a departure in the way in which democratic states clamp down on information in contentious areas, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, has said. India\u2019s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, made his first public statement on Thursday since the decision to remove Kashmir\u2019s special status, describing it as the start of a \u201cnew era\u201d that will help end decades of terrorism and separatism. Kaye told the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s something about this shutdown that is draconian in a way other shutdowns usually are not.\u201d The territory faces its fifth day in a lockdown imposed hours before the Indian government revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status, stripping away the autonomy it was granted in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947. Communications are often blocked in Indian-administered Kashmir, but the current clampdown is unprecedented in a time of relative peace. Unlike previous instances, landline phones and cable TV have been cut off. A strict curfew also means people are unable to leave their homes during the day, while only limited movement has been allowed at night. \u201cI can\u2019t recall a situation where there has been a total blackout of not only the two-way, multi-point communication systems that we are familiar with now \u2013 anything on the internet, WhatsApp etc \u2013 but also the one-direction communications like TV,\u201d Kaye said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty extensive and one of my concerns would be \u2013 in part because this is happening in a democratic state \u2013 it could be seen as a new departure for many states that are thinking about how to clamp down on the flow of information.\u201d He added that it was hard to identify a set of circumstances where a country shutting down access to the internet, especially for an extensive period of time, was legal under international law. Before the announcement on Monday, thousands of extra troops were deployed to Kashmir, where the government is likely to face major opposition. An insurgency against Indian rule has been waged for decades, and tens of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict. Despite a heavy security presence and strict curfew, protests have occurred. The restrictions have prevented people from calling for ambulances, accessing information or checking on family members. On Thursday, an opposition activist filed a petition in India\u2019s highest court challenging the security lockdown and communications block. In his first address to the nation since parliament was told article 370 \u2013 the part of the constitution guaranteeing Jammu and Kashmir special status \u2013 had been revoked, Modi described the changes as historic and attempted to assure residents the situation would soon become normal. \u201cThe scrapping of article 370 is the beginning of a new era,\u201d Modi said. Kashmir\u2019s special status had been used by Pakistan \u201cas a weapon to incite people of the region against India\u201d, but now India would rid the region of \u201cterrorism and terrorists\u201d, he added. \u201cThere will be a lot of development,\u201d Modi said. \u201cAll the citizens will be given their rights.\u201d Modi said the \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of the Kashmiri people with the rest of the nation would expedite development and create new jobs with investment from public and private companies, and even suggested a cinema industry could flourish. \u201cI think the whole world will come and shoot their films there,\u201d he said. \u201c[This will] bring employment for the people there.\u201d In other developments on Thursday, the state-run All India Radio reported more than 500 people had been arrested since the clampdown began, and Pakistan had suspended a key rail service with India and banned the screening of Indian films.

A period of due diligence would follow, with the likelihood of a final deal likely to be contingent on the extent of the government\u2019s financial support. Sources close to the situation said the chances of such support being forthcoming had been boosted by the change of government, highlighting the appointment of Simon Clarke as exchequer secretary to the Treasury. The department is likely to be pivotal in talks about government involvement in a rescue. Clarke is MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, a steel heartland that includes British Steel\u2019s special profiles division at Skinningrove. He has previously written about the importance of saving British Steel. The Labour MP Anna Turley, whose constituency included the Redcar steelworks which closed in 2015, said she had asked the government for assurances about selling British Steel as a whole entity. \u201cThe secretary of state and EY confirmed this is still the priority,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is working flat out to progress the sale to the next stage. Optimism that this can be achieved soon remains high. \u201cWe also discussed the commitments we would like to see from any buyer, including investment in the assets, enhanced training and protection of the terms and conditions of the workforce. Long-term commitment to the business and the UK steel industry is a priority too.\u201d The pace of talks has accelerated in recent weeks as pressure grows from lenders to the business, whose operations have been funded by the government while talks continue. If the company had collapsed, the government would have had first call on any money that could be retrieved, limiting the extent of creditor refunds. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThis government will leave no stone unturned to get a good solution for British Steel at Scunthorpe, Skinningrove and on Teesside.\u201d If discussions with Ataer break down, two other bidders are waiting in the wings although a deal with either could prove complicated. Liberty House, led by the Indian-born metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, would prefer to convert the Scunthorpe works from a blast furnace plant, which makes steel from scratch. It is seeking government loan guarantees to replace the blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces, which would be used to make products by recycling scrap steel. Greybull Capital, the investment group that owned British Steel when it collapsed into insolvency, is understood to remain interested in picking up parts of the business if the government\u2019s preference for selling the whole business does not materialise. In that scenario, the Scunthorpe steelworks would be likely to close for good. Allowing Greybull to cherrypick the best parts of a business that it owned when it collapsed could prove politically unpalatable, observers have said.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Though the proposed new criteria remain relatively vague, Johnson said he wanted the immigration system to be changed to make the UK a far more attractive place for scientists to be based.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were home to the world\u2019s first national DNA database, we discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/23/graphene-a-game-changer-in-making-building-with-concrete-greener\">graphene</a>, and our cutting-edge scientists should be proud to follow in the footsteps of titans like Ada Lovelace and Nobel laureates Francis Crick and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system\">Peter Higgs</a>,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut to ensure we continue to lead the way in the advancement of knowledge, we have to not only support the talent that we already have here, but also ensure our immigration system attracts the very best minds from around the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>Measures could include abolishing the cap on numbers under the tier 1 exceptional talent visas, even though the scientific community recently raised concerns about a low uptake from scientists of these types of specialised visas, rather than demand being too high.</p> \n<p>Other parts of the package could include expanding the pool of UK research institutes and universities able to endorse candidates, ensuring scientists\u2019 dependants can join them and work and that they have an accelerated path to settlement.</p> \n<p>But the proposals were ridiculed by the discoverer of graphene, the Nobel prize-winning physicist Prof Sir Andre Geim.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is to abolish any immigration restrictions on top scientists to counter fears that the UK\u2019s research reputation could be seriously damaged by a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister will instruct the Home Office and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to work on a new plan to ease entry to the UK for scientists ranging from those based at prestigious institutions to promising students who have won maths Olympiads. Downing Street sources suggested Johnson believed the UK should have sent signals immediately after the referendum that it would ease visa restrictions on skilled migrants to counter claims that the leave vote was anti-immigration, a policy rejected by Theresa May. Though the proposed new criteria remain relatively vague, Johnson said he wanted the immigration system to be changed to make the UK a far more attractive place for scientists to be based. \u201cWe were home to the world\u2019s first national DNA database, we discovered graphene, and our cutting-edge scientists should be proud to follow in the footsteps of titans like Ada Lovelace and Nobel laureates Francis Crick and Peter Higgs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to ensure we continue to lead the way in the advancement of knowledge, we have to not only support the talent that we already have here, but also ensure our immigration system attracts the very best minds from around the world.\u201d Measures could include abolishing the cap on numbers under the tier 1 exceptional talent visas, even though the scientific community recently raised concerns about a low uptake from scientists of these types of specialised visas, rather than demand being too high. Other parts of the package could include expanding the pool of UK research institutes and universities able to endorse candidates, ensuring scientists\u2019 dependants can join them and work and that they have an accelerated path to settlement. But the proposals were ridiculed by the discoverer of graphene, the Nobel prize-winning physicist Prof Sir Andre Geim. He told the Times: \u201cThe government may try and reduce the barriers to entry for scientists but they cannot reduce turmoil that would be caused to science in the UK by a no-deal Brexit. Scientists are not fools. They know that turmoil is inevitable for many years.\u201d Geim said his fellow Nobel laureate, Prof Sir Konstantin Novoselov, had left their base in Manchester, where the pair discovered graphene, after the 2016 vote to leave the EU. \u201cI think that tells you everything you need to know,\u201d he added. Johnson announced the plans on a visit to the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, which is a national research laboratory. Johnson said the government would provide additional funding for scientists and researchers who sought EU funding before the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, and any Horizon 2020 applications stuck in the approval process when the UK left would be reviewed automatically and successful applications provided with funding. The UK already has a system for fast-tracking some much-needed foreign science professionals into UK roles. A number of science professions are included on the official shortage occupation list, which allows firms to employ non-EEA migrants without having to advertise the role. Among the roles are biological scientists and biochemists, physical scientists, and social and humanities scientists, including archaeologists. Though there have been instances of high-profile scientists leaving the UK because of visa issues, the problems have almost always been with restrictions on family members. Ensuring visas for dependants is among the measures that No 10 has suggested it could offer to attract scientists to the UK. Last year Fengying Liu, a postdoctoral researcher in pathology, was recruited to Oxford\u2019s Sir William Dunn School of Pathology in October but left her post after the Home Office refused a visa for her 22-month-old child. The House of Commons science and technology committee heard evidence from the Royal Society last year that uptake of tier 1 visas was low, meaning the cap was never being reached. Prof Richard Catlow told the committee of MPs: \u201cThe big issue with tier 1 is that we need to get a higher proportion of uptake \u2026 With the other academies, we have been addressing the factors that led to a lower than desirable uptake for one scheme.\u201d Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem MP who chairs the science and technology committee, said the changes would need to go beyond easing restrictions on the most prestigious scientists. \u201cOften people will bring a team with them, of lab technicians and researchers, so you need smooth access for them,\u201d he said. Lamb said the preoccupation for the industry was the effects of no deal on access to funding and collaboration. The committee has recommended the government ease visa restrictions on scientists, researchers and skilled workers post-Brexit, including those only eligible for the lower tier 2 visa. Leading scientists have recently warned about the effect of no-deal Brexit on research collaboration and the UK\u2019s status as a leading research hub. The chair of the Wellcome Trust, Eliza Manningham-Buller, told the BBC last month that the vast bulk of the collaborations were with Europe and any new restrictions could lead to UK scientists being cut out of projects. In a letter sent to the prime minister in July, Lady Manningham-Buller said: \u201cWellcome spends around \u00a31bn a year to support research, and most of our money is spent in the UK because it has a thriving sector. Leaving the EU without a deal is a threat to that. I am afraid that some damage has already been done, with loss of researchers, and influence.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The singer and impressionist Joe Longthorne, who has died aged 64 of cancer, may have been categorised as a middle-of the-road cabaret entertainer, but nobody would deny his talent. In his hugely popular live shows and on television, he would brilliantly mimic idiosyncratic crooners such as Frank Sinatra, Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey, and be funny at the same time. The impressionist Rory Bremner once said: \u201cI wish I could sing like Joe Longthorne as I\u2019d love to do Sinatra.\u201d</p> <p>Although he had been a performer since childhood, Longthorne got his big break with an appearance on the LWT series Search for a Star in 1981. It led to his own variety specials and, getting away from the working men\u2019s clubs, a month-long engagement at the London night spot The Talk of the Town. This won him a Club Mirror award as specialist act of the year in 1983, and the Variety Club\u2019s most promising artist award the following year.</p> <p>After a regular guest spot on The Les Dennis Laughter Show (BBC), in 1988 Longthorne was given his own eponymous ITV show, co-starring the magician Wayne Dobson and produced by Nigel Lythgoe, which ran for three years and drew audiences of up to 10 million. </p> <p>In 1989, following a US tour culminating in Las Vegas, he starred in his first Royal Variety Performance. At the peak of his fame in the early 1990s, Longthorne filled the Royal Albert Hall and completed a record-breaking 19-week season at the Blackpool Opera House.</p> <p>Longthorne never took his audiences for granted. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few unfortunate nights where things have gone wrong,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut it is always down to me as a performer. I would never blame the audience.\u201d </p> <p>Born in Hull to Fred Longthorne, a scrap metal dealer, and Teresa (nee Sheridan), Joe was proud of his Gypsy heritage, and at home in the tough Hessle Road community where they lived.

Longthorne developed an uncanny ability for vocal impersonations, both male and female. He later said: \u201cI would take a tea chest on stage and I would dive into it and get things out, but then I learnt that the props got in the way of the impersonation.

Longthorne was drawn to songs that were universal in their meaning, rather than purely romantic. \u201cI love the lyrics of Wind Beneath My Wings,\u201d he said. \u201cA blind lady told me that she had lost her guide dog and when I sang, \u2018You\u2019re my hero,\u2019 she thought about him.

As a result, it gives us few clues about how we might survive the century. Has it been nobbled? Was the fear of taking on the farming industry \u2013 alongside the oil and coal companies whose paid shills have attacked it so fiercely \u2013 too much to bear? At the moment, I have no idea. But what the panel has produced is pathetic.</p> \n<p>The problem is that it concentrates on just one of the two ways of counting the carbon costs of farming. The first way \u2013 the IPCC\u2019s approach \u2013 could be described as farming\u2019s current account. How much greenhouse gas does driving tractors, spreading fertiliser and raising livestock produce every year? According to the panel\u2019s report, the answer is around 23% of the planet-heating gases we currently produce. But this fails miserably to capture the overall impact of food production.</p> \n<p>The second accounting method is more important. This could be described as the capital account: how does farming compare to the natural ecosystems that would otherwise have occupied the land? A paper <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0757-z\" title=\"\">published in Nature</a> last year, but not mentioned by the IPCC, sought to count this cost.

But in addition to this, the Nature paper estimates that the total greenhouse gas cost \u2013 in terms of lost opportunities for storing carbon that the land would offer were it not being farmed \u2013 of an average northern European diet is 9 tonnes a year. In other words, if we counted the \u201ccarbon opportunity costs\u201d of our diet, our total footprint would almost triple, to 14.4 tonnes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/08/climate-crisis-reducing-lands-ability-to-sustain-humanity-says-ipcc\">Climate crisis reducing land\u2019s ability to sustain humanity, says IPCC</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Why is this figure so high? Because we eat so much meat and dairy. The Nature paper estimates that the carbon cost of chicken is six times higher than soya, while milk is 15 times higher and beef 73 times. One kilo of beef protein has a carbon opportunity cost of 1,250kg: that, incredibly, is roughly equal to driving a new car for a year, or to one passenger flying from London to New York and back.</p> \n<p>These are global average figures, raised by beef production in places like the Amazon basin.

If our grazing land was allowed to revert to natural ecosystems, and the land currently used to grow feed for livestock was used for grains, beans, fruit, nuts and vegetables for humans, this switch would allow the UK to absorb an astonishing quantity of carbon. This would be equivalent, altogether, the paper estimates, to absorbing nine years of our total current emissions. And farming in this country could then feed everyone, without the need for imports.</p> \n<p>A plant-based diet would make the difference between the UK\u2019s current failure to meet its <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf\" title=\"\">international commitments</a>, and success.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3ad8b0d2-dd9c-45c8-8f8e-bff377dc2e91\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BSHR4sUZpcw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Then there are the nature opportunity costs.

Now scientists have pinpointed the chemicals behind the phenomenon, which not only cause the green glow, but possibly help defend the sharks against harmful microbes. \u201cWe have so much more to learn about life in the ocean and sharks,\u201d said Prof David Gruber, of City University of New York, a co-author of the study. The green glow emitted by the sharks is a type of biofluorescence, which arises when blue light in the oceans is absorbed and then re-emitted, in this case as green light. A number of difference chemical substances can produce such effects. The best known is the green fluorescent protein (GFP).

Then come the tweets of condemnation from world leaders, followed by an onslaught of outrage split down partisan lines. The way that shootings, or suicide bombings, or knife attacks are politicised depending on the backgrounds of the perpetrators and the victims shows how successful these acts are in deepening the divisions in society. And that is one of the intentions that the perpetrators share, no matter their race or politics. Tougher gun laws would certainly help, but attackers will still use knives, lorries or homemade explosives to kill and maim, if that\u2019s what they set out to do.

      "bodyText": "HERE WE GO AGAIN Deadline Day, 1.30pm (BST). With 3hr 29min 26.73sec to go until the transfer window shuts, a moment is captured in time. Brentford are lining up a deal for Sparta Rotterdam striker Halil Dervisoglu according to somebody on Twitter Sky Sources, Dominic Thompson to Brentford from Arsenal for an initial fee of \u00a31m is a done deal and \u2013 what\u2019s this?!?!? \u2013 QPR are favourites to sign Burnley striker Nakhi Wells on loan. Having just chaired a conversation in which all four participants had no idea whether or not Wilfried Zaha will leave Crystal Palace for Everton [turns out he won\u2019t \u2013 Fiver Ed], Sky Sports News presenter Jo Wilson has the air about her of a woman who has recently been and is about to once again go \u201caround the grounds\u201d where her colleagues Fraser Dainton (Finch Farm), Michael Bridge (Beckenham), Anton Toloui (Molineux) and Paul Gilmour (Hotspur Way) are keeping abreast of events as they don\u2019t really happen at Everton, Palace, Wolves and Spurs respectively. Out of shot in the studio\u2019s \u201csocial media hub\u201d, Jasper Taylor has just revealed the results of a survey in which an overwhelming majority of Newcastle fans have voted in favour of a return to St James\u2019 Park for their knack-prone former hero Andy Carroll. Not usually ones renowned for bowing in the face of public opinion, within moments the club hierarchy put their medical department on red alert and offered the centre-forward a one-year deal. Elsewhere, Queen\u2019s Celtic full-back Kieran Tierney has signed for Arsenal, where David Luiz is also thrashing out personal terms. Chelsea midfielder Danny Drinkwater is potentially going on loan to Burnley, while spiky Saints striker Charlie Austin is loitering around the Hawthorns with what can only be described as intent. At Tottenham, Giovani Lo Celso is coughing for the doctor, who it seems will not get to hear similar noises emanating from the throat of Paulo Dybala. Everything is happening and nothing is happening, as has always been the way. But with paperwork being sorted on last-minute deals worth millions ahead of 5pm, spare a thought for Bury, who are facing a far less glamorous but more pressing deadline of their own. Amid the transfer drama, Sky\u2019s own Yellow Ticker of Doom reported that the club face expulsion from the Football League in 14 days, unless they \u201cmeet all outstanding requirements of the league\u2019s insolvency policy\u201d by explaining how they plan to pay their bills. On a day renowned for its big-money announcements, a club going to the wall over what, in top-level football terms, amounts to chump change is the most depressing but least trumpeted of them all. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Jacob Steinberg for the thrilling denouement/death throes of the Premier League\u2019s summer transfer window, in the live deadline day blog. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cHe had the wrong mentality, the wrong attitude from day one. He was always going against the grain. It was like he had a vendetta. It was every day. I didn\u2019t like him. If we were told to wear this, he\u2019d wear something different. If I was a manager or an owner of a club I wouldn\u2019t take him if you paid me\u201d \u2013 Glen Johnson pulls no punches in his assessment of former team-mate Saido Berahino \u2013 earning a stinging rebuke from Ravel Morrison. RECOMMENDED LISTENING The latest edition of Football Weekly Extraaaaa is being recorded as the window slams \u2013 and will be in this general direction later. FIVER LETTERS \u201cMatthew Keeler needs to address us by our proper moniker; 32Red\u2019s Wayne Rooney\u2019s Derby County, otherwise this whole ruse might be broken and we\u2019ll end up with a very big bill we can\u2019t afford\u201d \u2013 Jordan Glossop. \u201cThe new Wales dragon emblem [Wednesday\u2019s Fiver] appears to be breathing fire that will singe its own wings. How very Brexity\u201d \u2013 Sharon Hammond. \u201cWhat delightful prose: \u2018In heraldic terms, the beast was traditionally salient and facing the dexter side\u2019. Informative, educational but, unfortunately, still not funny. Good effort though!\u201d \u2013 Johnny McIntyre. \u201cRe: Liverpool and Klopp\u2019s Beautiful South-driven transfer policy. I would say an even greater influence in recent years has been the Beautiful Southampton. As for the future plans of a certain displaced central defender \u2013 Let Lovren Speak Up Himself\u201d \u2013 Peter Oh. \u201cRe: The golden age of The Fiver [Fivers passim]. I\u2019ve just done a quick trawl of old emails, and found a 2005 Fiver complete with a letter from me, which suggests my age is teetering on the golden, and it\u2019s probably time to swap the skinny jeans and retro Golas for comfortable slacks and a pair of Hush Puppies\u201d \u2013 Daniel Kennedy. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport.

      "body": "<p>Ryanair passengers are facing the prospect of five days of disruption in late August and early September after talks to avert strike action by UK-based pilots broke down. Here\u2019s everything that customers need to know.</p> \n<h2><strong>When are Ryanair pilots going on strike?</strong></h2> \n<p>Ryanair pilots who are members of Balpa, the British pilots\u2019 trade union, have voted to stage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/07/mass-disruption-expected-after-ryanair-pilots-vote-for-strikes\">five days of strikes in the peak summer holiday period</a>. They plan a 48-hour strike from 00:01 on 22 August until 23.59 on 23 August, and a 72-hour strike from 00:01 on 2 September until 23.59 on 4 September.</p> \n<h2><strong>Which flights will be affected?</strong></h2> \n<p>It\u2019s not possible to say in detail, but the fact that the striking pilots are all based in the UK indicates that flights to and from UK airports will be the only ones affected. That suggests that passengers using Stansted, Ryanair\u2019s main UK base, can expect some disruption.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/16/ryanair-to-cut-services-due-to-boeing-737-max-crisis\">Ryanair to cut 30,000 flights owing to Boeing 737 Max crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not all Ryanair pilots are Balpa members and not all Balpa pilots will necessarily go on strike, so many flights will still go ahead. Ryanair typically drafts in replacement pilots in such situations, so expect the Irish airline to do everything it can to minimise the disruption. Tens of thousands of passengers could be affected across the strike dates.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s highly likely though that some flights will not take off, and passengers who have booked flights, or are thinking of doing so, should check with the airline. Ryanair tends to give passengers two or three days\u2019 notice if their flight is cancelled.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4db28889-c914-4b4c-b6ad-4ee0194d1882\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>When an airline starts cancelling or delaying flights for more than three hours, passengers are entitled to compensation of \u20ac250-\u20ac600 (\u00a3230-\u00a3550) under EU rules.</p>\n    <p>The cause of the problem has to be under the airline\u2019s control and not an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019. Lack of planes/staff, flight overbooking, a strike by airline staff or an IT failure are all considered to be within the airline\u2019s control \u2013 so compensation is payable.</p>\n    <p>Passengers on cancelled short-haul flights \u2013 up to 1,500km \u2013 are entitled to \u20ac250 or \u00a3230. For flights of 1,500km-3,500km, passengers are entitled to \u20ac400, and \u20ac600 for the longest flights (more than 3,500km).</p>\n    <p>Compensation is also payable if the plane is delayed.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair passengers are facing the prospect of five days of disruption in late August and early September after talks to avert strike action by UK-based pilots broke down. Here\u2019s everything that customers need to know. When are Ryanair pilots going on strike? Ryanair pilots who are members of Balpa, the British pilots\u2019 trade union, have voted to stage five days of strikes in the peak summer holiday period. They plan a 48-hour strike from 00:01 on 22 August until 23.59 on 23 August, and a 72-hour strike from 00:01 on 2 September until 23.59 on 4 September. Which flights will be affected? It\u2019s not possible to say in detail, but the fact that the striking pilots are all based in the UK indicates that flights to and from UK airports will be the only ones affected. That suggests that passengers using Stansted, Ryanair\u2019s main UK base, can expect some disruption. Not all Ryanair pilots are Balpa members and not all Balpa pilots will necessarily go on strike, so many flights will still go ahead. Ryanair typically drafts in replacement pilots in such situations, so expect the Irish airline to do everything it can to minimise the disruption. Tens of thousands of passengers could be affected across the strike dates. It\u2019s highly likely though that some flights will not take off, and passengers who have booked flights, or are thinking of doing so, should check with the airline. Ryanair tends to give passengers two or three days\u2019 notice if their flight is cancelled. Can I claim compensation if my flight is cancelled? Airlines are bound to pay EU compensation of between \u20ac250 and \u20ac600 (\u00a3230 and \u00a3555) if they cancel your flight without 14 days\u2019 notice, unless it is owing to an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It has been a transfer window full of the usual long-running sagas and occasional surprises, but it does seem to have been a bad-tempered few months, with more than the usual number of players \u2013 as well as the occasional manager \u2013 trying to force moves in the most public and spiteful style. Zinedine Zidane\u2019s treatment of Gareth Bale has done nothing to enhance the reputation of either the manager or the player. Bale looks restrained because he has not said anything, while Zidane looks the villain because he won\u2019t shut up. But if you were a sporting director at a club considering a move for Bale, the fact that his manager is so desperate to get rid of him would inevitably make you doubt whether he was the kind of character you want in your dressing room. It was strange to see a club treat a major asset so contemptuously, as if they do not care they are devaluing him, and then pull out of a deal with the one club who has made a genuine attempt to buy him because he was undervalued. Meanwhile, Zidane\u2019s behaviour, while clearly motivated by a desire for Bale to leave, is at the same time making it less likely anyone will take him. Elsewhere, there have been several players who have refused to join pre-season tours or turn up to training as they attempt to force clubs to let them leave. This has always happened, but perhaps less often and less publicly. It is only two years since Paris Saint-Germain bought Neymar for a world record \u20ac222m; this summer he has been desperately trying to engineer a way out again.

The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) issued the recommendation to chief constables of all forces in England and Wales in the wake of the 19-year-old\u2019s killing at the hands of her ex-boyfriend after he spent months stalking and harassing her. Michael Lane murdered Grice at her home in Brighton on 25 August 2016. She had reported Lane to police five times in six months and had been fined for wasting officers\u2019 time after she initially failed to disclose their relationship. The harassment case was closed before her pleas for help were properly investigated. In its final report on how officers handled Grice\u2019s complaints, the IOPC made a series of recommendations to Sussex police, advising them to properly train staff, improve risk assessments, communicate better and use systems correctly. The College of Policing and National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council have been told to get forces to make sure officers and staff have the skills to do their jobs properly when investigating crime. An independent panel found former PC Trevor Godfrey committed misconduct in the way he handled a report of harassment by Grice. This represented the final disciplinary proceeding in relation to the IOPC investigation. Sarah Green, the IOPC regional director, said: \u201cWe have been in regular contact with Sussex police during our investigation and since its conclusion, highlighting potential issues with how the force was handling allegations of stalking and harassment. \u201cHMICFRS [Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services] also conducted an in-depth assessment of the force\u2019s performance on stalking and harassment and has raised concerns. \u201cIt is vitally important that as part of our work, good practice is recognised and shared, while shortcomings, be it in policies, systems or training, are identified and improved. \u201cSussex police responded positively to our informal recommendations but the HMICFRS report published in April shows there is still work to be done.

Lane was arrested and told Godfrey the pair were in a relationship, and provided details of mobile phone messages to back up his story. Grice admitted she was in a relationship with Lane, and in an 84-second phone call Godfrey told Grice she would be fined for wasting police time over the harassment allegations \u2013 a decision ratified by police bosses.

      "body": "<p>On a humid July night in Newcastle upon Tyne, the launch party for Miss England 2019 is under way. In an unassuming grey-brick hotel, tucked away behind a multi-storey car park, the 52 finalists have gathered in their evening gowns, artificial silk sashes draped over their shoulders to display which region they represent and identifying numbers strapped to their wrists. The atmosphere is not unlike a high-school prom \u2013 nervous boyfriends lurk outside the banqueting hall clutching makeup cases, parents roam the hallways eager to catch a glimpse of their daughters and the finalists are always aware of the judges scattered throughout the room.</p> <p>Established in 1928, Miss England is the UK\u2019s longest-running beauty pageant, although some would argue pageantry has an even longer history in Britain, with its roots in choosing May Queens for traditional May Day celebrations.

Despite that, and the fact that the traditional spoils for the contestants \u2013 a modelling career and public profile \u2013 could arguably be more easily acheived in 2019 via a carefully curated Instagram feed, or reality show, somehow, beauty pageants are flourishing.

I wanted to show people a different side to pageants, that it\u2019s about personality and character.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b0ea970386247c57f23aca08dc355b8c0d3ae5c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0ea970386247c57f23aca08dc355b8c0d3ae5c8/0_568_6720_3912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miss Lancashire, Aysha Khan backstage in Newcastle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"582\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miss Lancashire, Aysha Khan backstage in Newcastle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been some backlash from religious groups who inisist Khan\u2019s appearance in the competition is indecent, but she is determined to continue. \u201cMiss England is the chance to become a role model and lead the next generation of young women by example,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It is this that sets beauty queens apart from social media stars, argues the finalist and junior doctor Bhasha Mukherjee. \u201cYou\u2019re representing a brand if you\u2019re an influencer, whereas here, you\u2019re representing your country. The pageant is about being a person of the world so much more than just yourself. It really humbles your ego.\u201d</p> <p>Talk to anyone involved in beauty pageants these days and this is the theme: pageants are not about beauty but \u201ccharacter and personality\u201d, \u201ccharity\u201d and, crucially of course, \u201cempowerment\u201d. It is a modern defence against the criticism levelled at competitions since 1968, when the burgeoning Women\u2019s Liberation Movement targeted the Miss America final. The women threw anything that represented the physical oppression of women into a \u201cfreedom trash can\u201d (famously misrepresented as \u201cbra burning\u201d) to show how beauty standards oppress women. In 1970, there were similar protests against Miss World in London. </p> <p>The journalist and activist Joan Smith was sent to cover local beauty pageants in Lancashire in the early 70s while working as a junior reporter. \u201cI thought it was pure anachronism, even then,\u201d she says. \u201cThese pageants directly exploit the idea that appearances are the most important thing for women.\u201d Despite their socially conscious rebranding, she still believes they are a deeply damaging presence. \u201cPageants feed on the perpetual anxieties of young women and their longevity only proves that there\u2019s always money to be made from exploiting women,\u201d she says. \u201cThey promote a very old-fashioned standard of beauty \u2013 with most winners being white or blond.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"650ba8cc525a4117fc259f9d667517348db9c01e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/650ba8cc525a4117fc259f9d667517348db9c01e/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miss England finalists listening to instructions ahead of the evening\u2019s pageant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miss England finalists listening to instructions ahead of the evening\u2019s pageant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lack of diversity in pageantry has long been a criticism of the industry with competitions such as Miss Black and Beautiful, which represented the Caribbean diaspora in England in the 1970s, having all but disappeared now. Leah Prescod, a former pageant competitor, set up Miss British Beauty Curve in 2012 for women over a size 14, in which more than 200 contestants have competed. \u201cI wanted to create a space where women who don\u2019t think they fit the mould of a beauty queen could compete,\u201d she says. \u201cIt might seem strange to use a competitive environment to build confidence, but sometimes getting on stage and out of your comfort zone is the only way to realise your inner strength.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Miss England, which made the infamous swimsuit round offstage and optional in 2010, Prescod\u2019s pageant encourages swimsuits. \u201cWe have all ages; from 18 to people in their 60s competing. We want them to feel good about themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cLots of the girls have never worn a bikini before, let alone in public, so it\u2019s not easy to get up and do it, but they find it really rewarding and they gain a lot of respect for one another in the process.\u201d</p> <p>Kat Henry, the 35-year-old winner of Miss British Beauty Curve 2015, agrees. \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d been so open and exposed. I wore things which I never would have done normally,\u201d she says. \u201cIt made me realise I have the same right as anyone else to be up on that stage. Beauty isn\u2019t all there is to a pageant \u2013 it\u2019s about women empowering other women.\u201d</p> <p>Confidence-building may be a recurring theme , but aligning individual confidence with the idea that being rated in a pageant is somehow empowering for women in general may seem a stretch. Pratishtha Raut, 26, had anxiety issues at university and reached crisis point in her final year when she didn\u2019t leave her house for 29 days. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was happening to me because I was brought up thinking mental health was for \u2018crazy\u2019 people,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter seeking help and getting better, it has been a passion of mine to advocate for better mental health, especially among my Nepalese community. That\u2019s why I was drawn to compete in Miss England, because their chosen charity this year is Papyrus.\u201d</p> <p>Raut has raised more than \u00a39,000 and says the competition has also unexpectedly brought her closer to her parents. \u201cIn Nepal, modelling isn\u2019t classified as a real job and so my parents pushed me to focus on my career,\u201d she says. \u201cBut going through this process has showed them that this could also be an option for me, along with the charity advocacy. They\u2019re actually more into it than me because they\u2019re so competitive \u2013 all they talk about is Miss England.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the seedier side of pageantry can be a problem. The 1980s kitsch aesthetic is cloyingly persistant \u2013 visible in the sequins, sashes and tiaras that bring to mind the televised Miss Universe pageants (at one time, the rights to which were owned by Donald Trump). Here, women would be paraded on stage in only a bikini and heels, their \u201cvital statistics\u201d read out to the mainly white and male audience. And there is also the question of money. While Miss England is free to enter, contestants speak of competitions where entrance fees can be up to \u00a31,000 in a pay-to-win scenario. There is also the cost of buying ball gowns, haircare, makeup and transport, although the majority of finalists have local sponsors.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone can buy the license to put on a pageant from the patent office,\u201d says the director of Miss England, Angie Beasley. \u201cThere are a lot of new competitions coming up \u2013 people are just buying titles and buying their way into national finals.\u201d For Beasley, the appeal of Miss England isn\u2019t just about history or a formalised judging process. \u201cMiss England is something for the girls to aspire to be \u2013 it\u2019s not the perfection of social media accounts, it\u2019s showing your humanity and beliefs within a competitive setting.\u201d</p> <p>Beasley points to the fact there is a Mr England competition to counter to the idea that such pageants objectify women. The men\u2019s pageant runs once every two years and attracts a fraction of the applications of its female counterpart. Mr England 2013, Jordan Williams, is hosting Miss England\u2019s live social-media coverage of the final and says competitors are looking for \u201ca bit of fun, to meet other people and to raise money for charity. And if it\u2019s objectifying to women, it\u2019s objectifying to me, then, because I\u2019ve been a part of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f47c3542f29981307dbf8f5996a11e9958a3b92a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f47c3542f29981307dbf8f5996a11e9958a3b92a/0_71_4260_2556/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kat Henry, Miss British Beauty Curve 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kat Henry, Miss British Beauty Curve 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, a men\u2019s competition only shows that men can be objectified too \u2013 however willingly they submit to it. Finalist Mukherjee, however, has a slightly different argument. \u201cWomen get objectified wherever we go,\u201d she says. \u201cSo why not use it to our advantage? If people are going to look at us because you\u2019re beautiful, why not use it to push forward a positive, charitable message?\u201d Surely there are easier ways to get your message across? \u201cThe glamour world is glamorous at the top and filthy when you get into it. At the same time, medicine is de-glam from the outside but beautiful on the inside. You need both in life,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to look for the positives and use what you\u2019re given.\u201d</p> <p>If beauty pageants are now so anti-beauty and pro-social change, why not change their name and change their format? \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw away this history,\u201d says 2015 Miss England winner Natasha Hemmings. \u201cWe are changing with the times and, ultimately, it\u2019s such an honour to represent your country at Miss World \u2013 it\u2019s no different from the Olympics or any other elite achievement.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the banqueting suite, where floor-to-ceiling metallic curtains are shimmering and fallen sequins are crushed underfoot on the pearl-white catwalk, it is Mukherjee who is crowned Miss England 2019. There follows the inevitable burst of confetti, tears and tiaras. Millie Mae Margetts counts this as her fourth loss, but is undeterred. \u201cI\u2019ve got the bug \u2013 I look forward to it every year and it\u2019s become such a passion of mine,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mukherjee is starting her new hospital rotation in the morning and looking forward to Miss World next year. \u201cThis is where the real work begins,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing a doctor is the same as being Miss England, because they\u2019re both about being a role model and an ambassador for good causes. I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d</p> <p>For the other contestants, the long ride home awaits until the whole process to begin again.</p>",

I wanted to show people a different side to pageants, that it\u2019s about personality and character.\u201d There has been some backlash from religious groups who inisist Khan\u2019s appearance in the competition is indecent, but she is determined to continue. \u201cMiss England is the chance to become a role model and lead the next generation of young women by example,\u201d she says. It is this that sets beauty queens apart from social media stars, argues the finalist and junior doctor Bhasha Mukherjee. \u201cYou\u2019re representing a brand if you\u2019re an influencer, whereas here, you\u2019re representing your country. The pageant is about being a person of the world so much more than just yourself. It really humbles your ego.\u201d Talk to anyone involved in beauty pageants these days and this is the theme: pageants are not about beauty but \u201ccharacter and personality\u201d, \u201ccharity\u201d and, crucially of course, \u201cempowerment\u201d. It is a modern defence against the criticism levelled at competitions since 1968, when the burgeoning Women\u2019s Liberation Movement targeted the Miss America final. The women threw anything that represented the physical oppression of women into a \u201cfreedom trash can\u201d (famously misrepresented as \u201cbra burning\u201d) to show how beauty standards oppress women. In 1970, there were similar protests against Miss World in London. The journalist and activist Joan Smith was sent to cover local beauty pageants in Lancashire in the early 70s while working as a junior reporter. \u201cI thought it was pure anachronism, even then,\u201d she says. \u201cThese pageants directly exploit the idea that appearances are the most important thing for women.\u201d Despite their socially conscious rebranding, she still believes they are a deeply damaging presence. \u201cPageants feed on the perpetual anxieties of young women and their longevity only proves that there\u2019s always money to be made from exploiting women,\u201d she says. \u201cThey promote a very old-fashioned standard of beauty \u2013 with most winners being white or blond.\u201d The lack of diversity in pageantry has long been a criticism of the industry with competitions such as Miss Black and Beautiful, which represented the Caribbean diaspora in England in the 1970s, having all but disappeared now. Leah Prescod, a former pageant competitor, set up Miss British Beauty Curve in 2012 for women over a size 14, in which more than 200 contestants have competed. \u201cI wanted to create a space where women who don\u2019t think they fit the mould of a beauty queen could compete,\u201d she says. \u201cIt might seem strange to use a competitive environment to build confidence, but sometimes getting on stage and out of your comfort zone is the only way to realise your inner strength.\u201d Unlike Miss England, which made the infamous swimsuit round offstage and optional in 2010, Prescod\u2019s pageant encourages swimsuits. \u201cWe have all ages; from 18 to people in their 60s competing. We want them to feel good about themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cLots of the girls have never worn a bikini before, let alone in public, so it\u2019s not easy to get up and do it, but they find it really rewarding and they gain a lot of respect for one another in the process.\u201d Kat Henry, the 35-year-old winner of Miss British Beauty Curve 2015, agrees. \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d been so open and exposed. I wore things which I never would have done normally,\u201d she says. \u201cIt made me realise I have the same right as anyone else to be up on that stage. Beauty isn\u2019t all there is to a pageant \u2013 it\u2019s about women empowering other women.\u201d Confidence-building may be a recurring theme , but aligning individual confidence with the idea that being rated in a pageant is somehow empowering for women in general may seem a stretch. Pratishtha Raut, 26, had anxiety issues at university and reached crisis point in her final year when she didn\u2019t leave her house for 29 days. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was happening to me because I was brought up thinking mental health was for \u2018crazy\u2019 people,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter seeking help and getting better, it has been a passion of mine to advocate for better mental health, especially among my Nepalese community. That\u2019s why I was drawn to compete in Miss England, because their chosen charity this year is Papyrus.\u201d Raut has raised more than \u00a39,000 and says the competition has also unexpectedly brought her closer to her parents. \u201cIn Nepal, modelling isn\u2019t classified as a real job and so my parents pushed me to focus on my career,\u201d she says. \u201cBut going through this process has showed them that this could also be an option for me, along with the charity advocacy. They\u2019re actually more into it than me because they\u2019re so competitive \u2013 all they talk about is Miss England.\u201d Yet the seedier side of pageantry can be a problem. The 1980s kitsch aesthetic is cloyingly persistant \u2013 visible in the sequins, sashes and tiaras that bring to mind the televised Miss Universe pageants (at one time, the rights to which were owned by Donald Trump). Here, women would be paraded on stage in only a bikini and heels, their \u201cvital statistics\u201d read out to the mainly white and male audience. And there is also the question of money. While Miss England is free to enter, contestants speak of competitions where entrance fees can be up to \u00a31,000 in a pay-to-win scenario. There is also the cost of buying ball gowns, haircare, makeup and transport, although the majority of finalists have local sponsors. \u201cAnyone can buy the license to put on a pageant from the patent office,\u201d says the director of Miss England, Angie Beasley. \u201cThere are a lot of new competitions coming up \u2013 people are just buying titles and buying their way into national finals.\u201d For Beasley, the appeal of Miss England isn\u2019t just about history or a formalised judging process. \u201cMiss England is something for the girls to aspire to be \u2013 it\u2019s not the perfection of social media accounts, it\u2019s showing your humanity and beliefs within a competitive setting.\u201d Beasley points to the fact there is a Mr England competition to counter to the idea that such pageants objectify women. The men\u2019s pageant runs once every two years and attracts a fraction of the applications of its female counterpart. Mr England 2013, Jordan Williams, is hosting Miss England\u2019s live social-media coverage of the final and says competitors are looking for \u201ca bit of fun, to meet other people and to raise money for charity. And if it\u2019s objectifying to women, it\u2019s objectifying to me, then, because I\u2019ve been a part of it.\u201d Of course, a men\u2019s competition only shows that men can be objectified too \u2013 however willingly they submit to it. Finalist Mukherjee, however, has a slightly different argument. \u201cWomen get objectified wherever we go,\u201d she says. \u201cSo why not use it to our advantage? If people are going to look at us because you\u2019re beautiful, why not use it to push forward a positive, charitable message?\u201d Surely there are easier ways to get your message across? \u201cThe glamour world is glamorous at the top and filthy when you get into it. At the same time, medicine is de-glam from the outside but beautiful on the inside. You need both in life,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to look for the positives and use what you\u2019re given.\u201d If beauty pageants are now so anti-beauty and pro-social change, why not change their name and change their format? \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw away this history,\u201d says 2015 Miss England winner Natasha Hemmings. \u201cWe are changing with the times and, ultimately, it\u2019s such an honour to represent your country at Miss World \u2013 it\u2019s no different from the Olympics or any other elite achievement.\u201d Back in the banqueting suite, where floor-to-ceiling metallic curtains are shimmering and fallen sequins are crushed underfoot on the pearl-white catwalk, it is Mukherjee who is crowned Miss England 2019. There follows the inevitable burst of confetti, tears and tiaras. Millie Mae Margetts counts this as her fourth loss, but is undeterred. \u201cI\u2019ve got the bug \u2013 I look forward to it every year and it\u2019s become such a passion of mine,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, Mukherjee is starting her new hospital rotation in the morning and looking forward to Miss World next year. \u201cThis is where the real work begins,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing a doctor is the same as being Miss England, because they\u2019re both about being a role model and an ambassador for good causes. I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d For the other contestants, the long ride home awaits until the whole process to begin again.",

      "bodyText": "The court of appeal has rejected an application by the Home Office to conduct an inquiry into claims of systemic abuse at an immigration detention centre in private, rejecting the claims that public hearings would be prohibitively expensive. In a further blow to the government, the argument that 21 G4S staff involved in the abuse allegations should not be compelled to give evidence was also rejected. Lord Justice Bean told the court of appeal: \u201cThe special investigation should be permitted to proceed without further delay.\u201d He said of the Home Office\u2019s application: \u201cI do not consider there is any realistic prospect of success.\u201d In June a high court judge, Mrs Justice May, ordered hearings for an inquiry into claims of systemic abuse at Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick airport be held in public and said that 21 staff from the security firm G4S, who were working there at the time, could be compelled to give evidence. It is the first time a public inquiry into abuse claims in detention has been ordered. The case was brought by two former immigration detainees known as MA and BB, who were featured in an undercover BBC Panorama programme about Brook House. Footage showed the first detainee being throttled by a member of G4S staff. The programme, broadcast in September 2017, revealed a culture of chaos with officials mocking, abusing and assaulting detainees, prompting the security firm to order an independent review. Despite the revelations, the Home Office awarded G4S a contract to run Brook House for a further two years. Of the 21 staff involved in the allegations 11 were dismissed or left the organisation after the BBC programme, says G4S. Three staff involved in the allegations later resigned. One was dismissed after subsequent similar behaviour. The Home Office asked the prisons and probation ombudsman to investigate the issues raised by Panorama. However, this investigation is being conducted behind closed doors and the G4S officers involved are not required to give evidence if they prefer not to. Bean said in Thursday\u2019s ruling: \u201cIt is difficult to see how a satisfactory investigation could be carried out in the present case without the alleged perpetrators of the abuse being required to give evidence.\u201d May said that while not all the hearings of the inquiry had to be held in public, some of them should be. A public inquiry was required, she said, because the \u201cfull extent of the discreditable behaviour has not been exposed to public view\u201d. Having open hearings would be necessary \u201cto maintain public confidence in the rule of law\u201d.

Savills, which sells and manages commercial and residential property around the world, said fewer houses were sold in the UK in the first half of 2019 than at any point since the first half of 2009. The declines have been led by London, where prices have fallen after years of rapid inflation. The average price of London homes sold by Savills fell by 32%, to \u00a32.1m, in the first half of 2019 compared with the previous year, as the company shifted towards less expensive homes to make up for a weakness in \u201cprime properties\u201d \u2013 those worth more than about \u00a33m. Weakness in the UK was mirrored in international markets amid \u201cpolitical instability and slowing global economic growth\u201d, Savills said. In Hong Kong, which has faced weeks of political protests, office investment volumes fell by 34% year-on-year in the period, while the broader Asia-Pacific region remained under the shadow of the trade war between the US and China. \u201cIn Asia Pacific, the imposition of Sino/US trade tariffs has affected investment confidence,\u201d Savills said in a statement to the stock market. Savills had previously warned it expected profits to decline in 2019, before either the Brexit extension or the Hong Kong protests, disruptions to business in two of its key markets. Mark Ridley, the chief executive of Savills, said: \u201cIn many markets, particularly the UK and Hong Kong, political and economic uncertainty has considerably reduced the volume of real estate trading activity in recent months, although occupier demand remains robust. \u201cUnderlying demand for the secure income qualities of real estate remains high, but these macro uncertainties weigh on investor sentiment and make predictions in respect of near-term market activity difficult to determine with accuracy.\u201d The company\u2019s total revenues grew 16% year-on-year in the first half to \u00a3847m, in part because of growth in non-transactional operations such as facilities management and consultancy. In the UK, both residential and commercial property sales volumes have been reduced by Brexit uncertainty since June 2016. While prices are still rising on average across the UK, the pace of growth has slowed. Average house prices in the UK increased by 1.2% in the year to May 2019, down from 1.5% in April 2019, the latest ONS figures show.

It comes at a time when the retail sector faces significant changes to its business model. The move to online purchases has diverted shoppers away from local high streets, resulting in a stream of store closures. Savills saidits figures indicated commercial property investment activity in greater London was down by 31% year-on-year, while investment in markets outside London fell 33%. Andrew Allen, the head of global investment research for real estate at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said the range of possible outcomes for investment in British property was \u201chigher than people can remember\u201d, mainly because of Brexit.

      "bodyText": "What do you call vodka produced from grain grown in the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, scene of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster 33 years ago? Atomik, of course. British scientists say the alcohol is free of dangerous radioactivity and could be mass produced to help economic recovery in the blighted region around Chernobyl. Prof Jim Smith from the University of Portsmouth hopes the traditionally distilled \u201cartisan\u201d alcohol can be produced and sold through a social enterprise called the Chernobyl Spirit Company, with 75% of profits going back to the local community. Reactor No 4 at the Chernobyl power plant exploded in the early hours of 26 April, 1986 sending a plume of radioactive dust across a swathe of Europe. An exclusion zone of 18 miles (30km) around the plant was evacuated of 350,000 residents and declared unsafe for human habitation for 24,000 years because of radioactive fallout. Today, local companies offer tourist tours into the exclusion zone, which has been declared a wildlife area. Studies show it hosts great biodiversity and experts report minimal negative effects of radiation on the flora and fauna. Smith said the vodka was blended with mineral water from a deep well near Chernobyl. \u201cI think this is the most important bottle of spirits in the world, because it could help the economic recovery of communities living in and around the abandoned areas,\u201d he said. A University of Portsmouth spokesman said the research team had found some radioactivity in the grain, grown on a farm in the exclusion zone. \u201cBut because distilling reduces any impurities in the original grain, the only radioactivity the researchers could detect in the alcohol is natural Carbon-14 at the same level you would expect in any spirit drink,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the main exclusion zone should be extensively used for agriculture as it is now a wildlife reserve, but there are other areas where people live but agriculture is still banned. \u201cWe aim to make a high-value product to support economic development outside the main exclusion zone where radiation isn\u2019t now a significant health risk.\u201d Oleg Nasvit, the first deputy head of the State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management, told AFP: \u201cWe welcome this initiative to use abandoned lands to help local communities. It is important that we do everything we can to support the restoration of normal life in these areas whilst always putting safety first. \u201cI\u2019d call this a high-quality moonshine.

He knows Britain has never quite nailed late-night TV satire, and he is undaunted. Of course, the budgets are smaller than those his American counterparts enjoy (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/13/trevor-noah-on-satires-uphill-battle-in-the-age-of-trump-the-daily-show\" title=\"\">Trevor Noah</a> is paid an eye-watering fee to not think about anything other than The Daily Show\u201d). Is it the same for Tez? \u201cWell, some of the digits are the same \u2013 but the zeroes are in all the wrong places.\u201d</p> <p>He cites Noah\u2019s Daily Show as an inspiration, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/24/why-i-love-hasan-minhaj-tv-comedy-the-daily-show\" title=\"\">Hasan Minhaj\u2019s Patriot Act</a> and The Mash Report. \u201cWe\u2019ll take elements of all those [and] sprinkle my comedic personality over it.\u201d The show is made up of sketches, a \u201cshisha cafe\u201d where Ilyas and comic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/09/sindhu-vee-sandhog-review-soho-theatre\" title=\"\">Sindhu Vee</a> interview guests, and a Briefing Room \u2013 drawing on Ilyas\u2019s previous life as a Home Office civil servant \u2013 where (northern, working-class) comics Adam Rowe and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/09/sophie-willan-working-class-standup\" title=\"\">Sophie Willan</a> offer up takes on the big political questions of the day.</p> <p>There are also \u201cprovocative topical monologues\u201d, including a pro-Brexit tirade (even though Ilyas is a Remainer) and a rant against animals. That\u2019s partly for provocation\u2019s sake and also because \u2013 as with the accents, so with the ideas \u2013 he wants to reach out beyond the liberal Channel 4 bubble. \u201cThe people I most want to reach may not tune into this show \u2013 because I am the face of it, maybe. But I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll see clips online and enjoy what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>He believes in the power of funny to bridge political divides. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/06/the-book-of-mormon-review-a-visionary-musical-masterpiece-genital-jokes-and-all\">The Book of Mormon musical</a> is so offensive to what I believe in \u2013 because Mormons and Muslims believe in the same God,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I saw that show, I could put all that aside because the funny trumps how offended I am. That\u2019s what I\u2019m aiming for.\u201d</p> <p>Islam is important to Ilyas: his standup shows demystified British Islam for a wider audience; his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-CEmG0kqZk\">Channel 4 sitcom pilot, Bounty</a>, trod a similar line. In our interview, he talks as much about class as race \u2013 but it\u2019s still a big deal that Channel 4\u2019s new late-night satire is fronted by a British Pakistani.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was growing up, I had Lenny Henry, The Real McCoy, then Goodness Gracious Me.

      "bodyText": "Tez Ilyas\u2019s new show has been described as \u2013 to quote Channel 4\u2019s publicity \u2013 \u201cTRULY anti-establishment\u201d. I\u2019ve seen the 36-year-old\u2019s standup: it\u2019s cheeky, it\u2019s deceptively subversive, it loudly advertises his light-ent credentials. But \u201cTRULY anti-establishment\u201d feels like a stretch. And yet, TV satire is different from standup, and has a different establishment to be anti. \u201cI\u2019m a working-class northern British-Asian Muslim,\u201d says Ilyas. \u201cWe\u2019ve got other working-class northern people on the show. I don\u2019t think you see a lot of that on our TVs, particularly in satire. \u201cThe people we\u2019ve trusted to do that [in the past] are brilliant voices,\u201d he says, of the Oxbridge/Radio 4 nexus that tends to define topical UK comedy. \u201cBut there is space for something different.\u201d A police siren sounds loudly outside our cafe. \u201cI must have said \u2018northern\u2019 too many times,\u201d he deadpans. We meet a week before the first of three episodes of The Tez O\u2019Clock Show is aired, and the comic cannot hide his excitement. He knows Britain has never quite nailed late-night TV satire, and he is undaunted. Of course, the budgets are smaller than those his American counterparts enjoy (\u201cTrevor Noah is paid an eye-watering fee to not think about anything other than The Daily Show\u201d). Is it the same for Tez? \u201cWell, some of the digits are the same \u2013 but the zeroes are in all the wrong places.\u201d He cites Noah\u2019s Daily Show as an inspiration, alongside Hasan Minhaj\u2019s Patriot Act and The Mash Report. \u201cWe\u2019ll take elements of all those [and] sprinkle my comedic personality over it.\u201d The show is made up of sketches, a \u201cshisha cafe\u201d where Ilyas and comic Sindhu Vee interview guests, and a Briefing Room \u2013 drawing on Ilyas\u2019s previous life as a Home Office civil servant \u2013 where (northern, working-class) comics Adam Rowe and Sophie Willan offer up takes on the big political questions of the day. There are also \u201cprovocative topical monologues\u201d, including a pro-Brexit tirade (even though Ilyas is a Remainer) and a rant against animals. That\u2019s partly for provocation\u2019s sake and also because \u2013 as with the accents, so with the ideas \u2013 he wants to reach out beyond the liberal Channel 4 bubble. \u201cThe people I most want to reach may not tune into this show \u2013 because I am the face of it, maybe. But I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll see clips online and enjoy what we\u2019re doing.\u201d He believes in the power of funny to bridge political divides. \u201cThe Book of Mormon musical is so offensive to what I believe in \u2013 because Mormons and Muslims believe in the same God,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I saw that show, I could put all that aside because the funny trumps how offended I am. That\u2019s what I\u2019m aiming for.\u201d Islam is important to Ilyas: his standup shows demystified British Islam for a wider audience; his Channel 4 sitcom pilot, Bounty, trod a similar line. In our interview, he talks as much about class as race \u2013 but it\u2019s still a big deal that Channel 4\u2019s new late-night satire is fronted by a British Pakistani. \u201cWhen I was growing up, I had Lenny Henry, The Real McCoy, then Goodness Gracious Me. Then there was nothing for a long time.\u201d It\u2019s only recently \u2013 Ilyas credits Henry\u2019s drive for more diversity on telly \u2013 that the floodgates have opened, with breakthroughs for Romesh Ranganathan, Nish Kumar, and the success of Guz Khan\u2019s sitcom (co-starring Ilyas) Man Like Mobeen. \u201cFor the longest time, after 9/11 and after 7/7, people were talking about us. Now there\u2019s the chance to see things from our perspective.\u201d Until recently, you wouldn\u2019t have bet on Ilyas leading the charge. He was a civil servant, working on the London Olympics, then in the modern slavery unit. He\u2019d never been to a comedy club. Feeling lonely in London, he signed up to an evening standup course \u2013 \u201cwithout which, there is 0% chance I would be doing what I\u2019m doing. If you\u2019d told me when I was 16 that this was the career I\u2019d end up with, I\u2019d have had you sectioned.\u201d He went on to juggle the two careers for six years, only quitting politics in 2016, when \u201cas compensation for my family, who thought I was mad, I left London to live back in Blackburn\u201d. He lives there still, close to his parents who are just about on board with the new career. \u201cMy mum still worries what God will think about me standing onstage taking the mick out of people. But now that she\u2019s seen that I\u2019m making money, she\u2019s coming round.\u201d We\u2019re not talking Trevor Noah sums yet \u2013 but if The Tez O\u2019Clock Show makes it to a full series, who knows? \u201cI\u2019m not deluded,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to be the greatest show of all time in three episodes. But I hope people will look at it and go: \u2018That\u2019s a show we want to see more of.\u2019 I\u2019d love that.\u201d The Tez O\u2019Clock Show is on Thursday 8 August, 11.35pm, Channel 4",

Peg-gy!\u201d</em></p> <p>Peggy Gou, the 28-year-old South Korean DJ and producer, is bringing her set to a storming close. Wearing a silky Louis Vuitton shirt and blue sunglasses, she has woven in acid house, drum\u2019n\u2019bass and grime, but nothing gets a response like the tantalising kickdrum of her own recent single, Starry Night. The other DJs, Palms Trax and Benji B, hold their own, but the unadulterated love is reserved for Gou. When she\u2019s not behind the decks, she can be found in the crowd, posing for an endless queue of selfies.</p> <p>It is special to catch Gou in Berlin, because while she ostensibly lives here, she is usually DJing around the world, being <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0aW82zIVXy/\" title=\"\">gifted toy giraffes</a> (her favourite animal) or T-shirts printed with puns on her name (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/peggygoupeggygou/posts/thanks-to-the-guy-who-gave-me-this-just-gou-it-t-shirt-let-them-eat-cake-in-melb/2202677896653950/\" title=\"\">\u201cJust Gou it\u201d</a>).

She would spend every weekend in Berghain, where the music she heard shaped the unpredictable DJ she is today. \u201cI really like Detroit DJs, like Maurice Fulton. You feel like he\u2019s going to play something techno, then all of a sudden it\u2019s disco.\u201d</p> <p>Since materialising with her first release in 2016, Gou now has her own record label, a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kirin_____________/?hl=en\" title=\"\">fashion label</a> in association with Louis Vuitton\u2019s Virgil Abloh, nearly a million <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/peggygou_/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> followers and her very own mini-festival in London: this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.skiddle.com/whats-on/London/Finsbury-Park/Peggy-Gou-presents-The-Pleasure-Gardens/13559175/\" title=\"\">Pleasure Gardens</a>. She has never had a manager, evidently preferring to be in charge. When I turn up to meet her at a nail bar where she is getting a manicure, Gou takes over from her manicurist and quickly finishes the job herself. The resulting neon tips are immaculate.</p> <p>Growing up, Gou was a huge K-pop fan (\u201cold K-pop is better than new K-pop\u201d), but her musical education really began when she moved to the UK at 14 for school. As a minor, Gou spent three years living with guardians, but \u201cI became a rebel. I lied to them, and I\u2019d come home late [from parties].\u201d At 18, she got into the London College of Fashion, and spent every weekend dancing at Plastic People or Corsica Studios. When a promoter from the Soho club Cirque Le Soir noticed a Facebook photo of her behind decks \u2013 Gou had picked up the basics of beatmatching from a friend in Korea \u2013 they asked if she would like to play. She began a weekly residency at the Book Club in east London, and used her free time to teach herself how to produce using the audio software Ableton.

      "bodyText": "Between the concrete walls of Funkhaus in Berlin, on a muggy July night, a whistling, whooping crowd are clapping sweaty palms together and chanting: \u201cPeg-gy! Peg-gy! Peg-gy!\u201d Peggy Gou, the 28-year-old South Korean DJ and producer, is bringing her set to a storming close. Wearing a silky Louis Vuitton shirt and blue sunglasses, she has woven in acid house, drum\u2019n\u2019bass and grime, but nothing gets a response like the tantalising kickdrum of her own recent single, Starry Night. The other DJs, Palms Trax and Benji B, hold their own, but the unadulterated love is reserved for Gou. When she\u2019s not behind the decks, she can be found in the crowd, posing for an endless queue of selfies. It is special to catch Gou in Berlin, because while she ostensibly lives here, she is usually DJing around the world, being gifted toy giraffes (her favourite animal) or T-shirts printed with puns on her name (\u201cJust Gou it\u201d). Recently, she tells me over coffee, she managed to squeeze in a holiday in Ibiza \u2013 a \u201choliday\u201d, in DJ terms, meaning that she managed to avoid travelling for a whole weekend. Since arriving in Berlin, she has quickly risen to become one of dance music\u2019s biggest names. \u201cBefore I was a DJ, I was a raver,\u201d she says proudly. She would spend every weekend in Berghain, where the music she heard shaped the unpredictable DJ she is today. \u201cI really like Detroit DJs, like Maurice Fulton. You feel like he\u2019s going to play something techno, then all of a sudden it\u2019s disco.\u201d Since materialising with her first release in 2016, Gou now has her own record label, a fashion label in association with Louis Vuitton\u2019s Virgil Abloh, nearly a million Instagram followers and her very own mini-festival in London: this month\u2019s Pleasure Gardens. She has never had a manager, evidently preferring to be in charge. When I turn up to meet her at a nail bar where she is getting a manicure, Gou takes over from her manicurist and quickly finishes the job herself. The resulting neon tips are immaculate. Growing up, Gou was a huge K-pop fan (\u201cold K-pop is better than new K-pop\u201d), but her musical education really began when she moved to the UK at 14 for school. As a minor, Gou spent three years living with guardians, but \u201cI became a rebel. I lied to them, and I\u2019d come home late [from parties].\u201d At 18, she got into the London College of Fashion, and spent every weekend dancing at Plastic People or Corsica Studios. When a promoter from the Soho club Cirque Le Soir noticed a Facebook photo of her behind decks \u2013 Gou had picked up the basics of beatmatching from a friend in Korea \u2013 they asked if she would like to play. She began a weekly residency at the Book Club in east London, and used her free time to teach herself how to produce using the audio software Ableton. Unsurprisingly, she failed her fashion course. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t let me come back to Korea, because I failed, and they were like: \u2018Do you know how much your course is? If you don\u2019t pass, you\u2019re not coming back\u2019.\u201d They made her stay at school for an extra two months to get the qualification. She moved to Berlin straight afterwards. \u201cThis was my life in Berlin: working at a record store, working on music at home, Berghain every Sunday,\u201d she summarises. \u201cMy parents were like: \u2018You wanted to do fashion, now you want to do music, what\u2019s next?\u2019 I said to them: \u2018Give me a few years.

In 2018, she scaled new heights with the Once EP, containing It Makes You Forget (Itgehane), the tune that launched a thousand videos of English-speaking crowds awkwardly and enthusiastically singing in Korean. Gou sometimes refers to her music as \u201cK-house\u201d. \u201cI believe that a lot of Korean and K-pop artists, they want to be European,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there are so many beautiful things in Korea.

At one point, she\u2019s reduced to tears when the crowd readily sings Lou Bega\u2019s Mambo No 5 at her request, before she embarks on a feminist lyrical analysis of the track, noting how it doesn\u2019t pass the Bechdel test. Ironically, she adds, the pornographic film 2 Girls 1 Cup does. It ends with a special guest: singer-songwriter Grace Petrie, whose well-received political songs map the essence of the show. Her appearance is a reflection of The LOL Word\u2019s high standing among LGBTQ+ women and non-binary comics (other guests this fringe include Suzi Ruffell, Sophie Duker and Sarah Keyworth). The LOL Word kicks back against years of demeaning jokes about women and the LGBTQ+ community. This is all about punching up, not down, as Green tells me after the show. As a lesbian, it\u2019s refreshing and revitalising to watch: they are energetic and exciting, oozing with passion. The LOL Word is proof that you don\u2019t have to mock the marginalised to be funny. They\u2019re an ode to queer subcultures: butch, femme, and whatever else they want, really.

Lack of planes/staff, flight overbooking, a strike by airline staff or an IT failure are all considered to be within the airline\u2019s control \u2013 so compensation is payable.</p>\n      <p>Passengers on cancelled short-haul flights \u2013 up to 1,500km \u2013 are entitled to \u20ac250 or \u00a3230. For flights of 1,500km-3,500km, passengers are entitled to \u20ac400, and \u20ac600 for the longest flights (more than 3,500km).</p>\n      <p>Compensation is also payable if the plane is delayed. The payments are the same but only kick in when the plane has been delayed three hours for short flights or four hours for the longer trips. The delay is calculated against the time the plane was due to arrive.</p>\n      <p>Passengers are also entitled to \u2018assistance\u2019 under the EU rules. Short-haul passengers should receive food and water after two hours. Mid-distance passengers get help after three hours, while long-haul passengers receive it after they have been held in the terminal for four hours. If the delay is overnight, passengers should be provided with hotel accommodation but this often does not happen. This assistance should be provided irrespective of whether the delay is the airline\u2019s fault.</p>\n      <p>The airlines have fought these compensation rules since they were introduced and passengers have had to go to court to get their money. The airlines frequently blame delays on events outside their control. Freak weather events or a last-minute strike by air traffic controllers are deemed to be outside their control. A lack of planes or staff is not.</p>\n      <p>The rules only apply to EU-based airlines or all flights that start in the EU on non-EU based carriers.

The sharp drop in the yuan this week, beyond the key 7 per dollar mark for the first time since spring 2008, should help exporters although they are now facing fresh US tariffs from September along with weaker global demand.</p> \n  <p>Exports rose 3.3% in July from a year earlier, the biggest rise since March, customs data showed. Analysts had expected a 2% decline after June\u2019s 1.3% fall.

The country\u2019s trade surplus with the US shrank to $27.97bn in July from June\u2019s $29.2bn. However, it reached $168.5bn in the first seven months of this year, highlighting the imbalances between the two countries that have angered Donald Trump. </p> \n  <p>Washington raised tariffs on Chinese goods in May after negotiations broke down whereupon Beijing retaliated. A truce was reached in July in the year-long trade war but was shattered last Friday when Trump vowed to slap a 10% tariff on $300bn of Chinese imports from 1 September.</p> \n  <p>European shares rebounded yesterday and are expected to continue their recovery today, taking their cue from Asia, where a stronger yuan has calmed nerves. The People\u2019s Bank of China fixed the yuan at a firmer-than-expected rate overnight, to limit its decline, albeit above the seven-to-one-dollar level.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Japan\u2019s Nikkei up 0.4% at 20,598.11</li> \n   <li>Taiwan\u2019s TSEC 50 up 1.04% at 10,494.49</li> \n   <li>Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng up 0.71% at 26,174.74</li> \n   <li>Shanghai Composite up 0.96% at 2,795.21</li> \n   <li>Australia ASX up 0.82% at 6,642.30 </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>US stocks suffered declines yesterday as some traders piled into the safety of US government bonds, driving bond yields lower.

      "bodyText": "A degree of calm has returned to world stock markets, after heavy selling earlier this week amid fears that the one-year trade war between the US and China was turning into a full-blown currency war. Washington branded Beijing a currency manipulator after the yuan fell sharply beyond the seven-to-one-dollar mark on Monday. This led to turmoil in financial markets \u2013 and US and UK stocks had their worst day this year. Investors have been cheered today by better-than-expected trade data from China and the stabilisation of its currency. Wall Street has opened higher. In Europe, shares are even further ahead. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 0.64% at 7,245, a gain of 45 points Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.07% at 11,774 France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1.59% at 5,350 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.91% at 20,724 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 1% at 8,833 Gold, considered a safe-haven investment, is still trading near $1,500 an ounce, however, as nervousness lingers. It is at $1,496, down 0.33%. Thank you for all your comments. Good-bye \u2013 we\u2019ll be back tomorrow to track the latest developments in markets and the business world. On Wall Street, stocks are up after the opening bell, mirroring gains in the UK, where the FTSE 100 index is 0.7% ahead at 7,250. Dow Jones up 117 points, or 0.45%, at 26,124 S&amp;P 500 up 16 points, or 0.56%, at 2,900 Nasdaq up 58 points, or 0.74%, at 7,920 In continental Europe, the main indices have recorded bigger gains, of 1% to 1.6%. More than three quarters of Europeans (76%) are in favour of the single currency \u2013 the highest level of support ever recorded, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey, conducted after the European elections between 7 June and 1 July in all 28 EU countries and five candidate countries. In the EU as a whole, support for the euro is stable at 62%. The other main finding is that climate change has turned into the second top concern among EU citizens, after immigration. Jobless claims in the US fell to 209,000 in the week to 3 August from 217,000, a better than expected outturn. The official data add to other evidence that the US economy remains in robust shape. The four-week average rose slightly to 212,250 from 212,00. As hundreds of thousands of Ryanair passengers wait to hear whether their flights will be cancelled during five days of planned pilot strikes during the peak summer holiday period, we answer some of the key questions. Here is another good piece, by the Independent\u2019s travel correspondent Simon Calder. And my colleague Miles Brignall on Guardian Money has pulled together a quick guide to your rights when flights are cancelled or delayed. Here is our story on Savills, which warned today that the UK housing market is at the weakest point since the global financial crisis a decade ago, as Brexit uncertainty puts off buyers. My colleague Jasper Jolly writes: Savills, which sells and manages commercial and upmarket residential property around the world, said it had sold fewer houses in the UK in the first half of 2019 than at any point since the first half of 2009. The declines have been led by London, where prices have fallen after years of rapid inflation. The average price of London homes sold by Savills fell by 32%, to \u00a32.1m, in the first half of 2019 compared with the previous year, as the company shifted towards less expensive homes to make up for a weakness in \u201cprime properties\u201d \u2013 those worth more than \u00a31.5m. Volumes of more expensive prime homes in central London fell by 13%. Outside the capital average prices edged up. A monthly survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors released overnight showed UK house prices dropped by more than expected in July, with consumers becoming increasingly cautious as Brexit looms. Mortgage lenders\u2019 claims for home repossessions in England and Wales have hit their highest level in more than four years, official figures show. Britain\u2019s Ministry of Justice recorded 6,179 claims in county courts for repossessions in the three months to June, up 39% compared with a year earlier and the biggest annual increase since the financial crisis in 2008/2009. Tim Waterlow, development director of mortgage provider Responsible Lending, says: Financial stress in British households is rearing its ugly head in these figures. The number of repossessions may be small in relative terms but this is a keenly watched indicator of economic health for the country. Things aren\u2019t nearly as bad as they were around the time of the financial crisis in 2009 when repossessions peaked but such a large jump, topping the year-on-year rise seen in the final quarter of last year, raises fears serious financial strain among households is on an upward trajectory once again. Repossessions are still below the levels seen during the global financial crisis and during the early 1990s recession, when they exceeded 25,000 a quarter. Households have benefited from wages rising at the fastest pace in a decade and unemployment at its lowest rate the 1970s. However, the household savings rate \u2013 a measure of how much households save out of their disposable income \u2013 is close to a record low and the number of people falling into financial distress has increased over the past 18 months. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst UK and EMEA at trading platform Oanda, has sent us his thoughts. It\u2019s been a wild ride in the markets so far this week and there\u2019s little reason to expect anything different today, with Europe currently higher and US futures in the green. It\u2019s safe to say investors are struggling to make up their mind at the moment. On the one hand, the trade war is a significant downside risk to the global outlook but on the other, central banks are cutting rates around the world in a bid to halt the slowdown before it takes hold. I guess the fact that we haven\u2019t had an escalation in the last couple of days is also helping, given how quickly everything escalated in the immediate aftermath of the talks in Shanghai. Markets clearly aren\u2019t stabilising but the sell-off has stalled, for now, which will come as a relief. European shares are trading higher, cheered by strong Chinese exports and the absence of any further escalation in the US-China trade war. It is the second day of gains, restoring some calm to markets after several days of heavy selling and a sharp fall in the yuan beyond the seven-to-one-dollar level, which prompted Washington to brand Beijing a currency manipulator on Monday. Asian stocks also recovered overnight. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 22 points, or 0.31%, at 7,220 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.76% at 11,738 France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1.23% at 5,331 Italy\u2019s MiB up 0.77 at 20,698 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.88% at 8,823 The spot price of gold broke through $1,500 an ounce for the first time since April 2013 yesterday, as investors sought safer assets amid the trade tensions. Gold is now trading at $1,496 an ounce, down 0.3% on the day. In India, gold prices hit a record high of Rs 37,920 per 10 gram in Delhi due to strong buying from jewellers. The pound has firmed slightly against the dollar and the euro, to $1.2156 and \u20ac1.0847, after hitting two-year lows last week. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at broker ActivTrades, has looked at the moves in currency markets: It was a turbulent start to the week, which saw the yuan break the 7 to $1 level, as well a sharp rise of traditional safe haven currencies, like the yen and the Swiss Franc, against other majors. Today we are experiencing the proverbial calm after the storm, and all major currency crosses are nearly flat. It is worth mentioning that, despite the apparent tranquillity, the market sentiment still favours traditional refuge assets, as international trade tensions continue to cast long shadows over the growth prospects of the global economy and threatening a global recession. There\u2019s some good news out of Athens: the jobless rate dropped to 17.2% in May, from 17.4% (which was revised down) in April, according to official data. This was the lowest unemployment rate since May 2011. Youth unemployment also declined significantly. The number of unemployed people was 815,166, with younger people aged up to 24 still the worst affected, according to seasonally adjusted data. However, among younger people aged 15 to 24, the jobless rate fell to 33.8% from 38.9%. Analysts are cautious about the recovery in global shares. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: There remains little prospect of a swift resolution to the current impasse between the US and China, as the People\u2019s Bank of China fixed the yuan above the 7.00 level for the first time since 2008. This means that for this rebound to gain further momentum we would need to see evidence of a softening of the rhetoric around trade, and a willingness on the part of both parties to dial back their current positions. The rebound in the equity markets is also being helped by a rebound in yields in bond markets after yields hit record lows in Germany and the UK yesterday, and three central banks, including the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Reserve Bank of India slashed their benchmark lending rates. Iris Pang, ING\u2019s economist for Greater China, has delved into the Chinese trade data. She found some unusual export activity, which may have distorted the headline number. Unusual items appeared to be very supportive to exports. China exported more coal (64% month-on-month), which could be due to a surplus in coal mining, as well as more fertiliser (42% month on month). It even exported more crude oil (56% MoM), which is very unusual because China\u2019s crude exports had fallen 61.8% year-on-year in the year to date. It is possible that these exports are going to the Belt and Road economies which, if true, could be the start of a new trend for China\u2019s exports. The more typical export items put in a fairly average performance. Handsets grew 9% month on month but were down 15.8% year-on-year in the year to date and auto-process computers fell 8.0% month on month. Combining the two, we don\u2019t hold a very positive view of China\u2019s exports because these two items usually comprise much of the growth. The pound has risen slightly against the dollar today. It is trading at $1.2168, up 0.2%, and is flat versus the euro at \u20ac1.0843. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at currency broker FXTM, has looked at interest rate cuts and the latest market moves. After a 2% slide in US equities early Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 managed to erase all losses and end up 0.1% higher. Such market reversals have been very rare during the decade-long bull market. As for the reasons for the recovery, there is no one precise reason. For some investors, the S&amp;P\u2019s 6.6% drop since July 29 may have looked exaggerated, hence an opportunity to buy bargain stocks. Others point to the steep fall in US Treasury yields which have fallen 22% on the 10-year bonds in just six days, making stocks a better alternative. However, one common factor that all investors seem to agree upon is the expectation of lower interest rates going forward. Central banks across the globe are rushing to lower interest rates. Yesterday central banks in New Zealand, Thailand, and India all announced larger-than-expected interest rate cuts. Sayed says: This aggressive approach to monetary policy easing isn\u2019t justified when looking at hard data; however, policymakers seem to be getting prepared for a worsening global economic outlook. Bets on the Federal Reserve cutting rates by 50 basis points in September are also on the rise. Investors are currently pricing in a 21% chance of a 50 basis point cut in the next meeting. That\u2019s up from 0% last week. Analysts warned that the boost from the weaker yuan for Chinese exporters may not last, though, as new US 10% tariffs kick in on $300bn of Chinese goods on 1 September. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, says: Looking ahead, exports still look set to remain subdued in the coming quarters as any prop from a weaker renminbi [the Chinese currency\u2019s official name] should be overshadowed by further US tariffs and broader external weakness. Despite the recovery in global shares, which comes after heavy selling earlier this week, gold \u2013 considered a safe-haven asset in times of turmoil \u2013 is still hovering near $1,500 an ounce. Spot gold is currently at $1,498 an ounce. Gold rose through $1,500 an ounce yesterday afternoon for the first time since 2013, taking the metal\u2019s gains this year to 17%. Back to the Chinese trade data. Lu Yu, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, said a weaker Chinese yuan against the US dollar and other currencies has helped Chinese manufacturers to sell their goods overseas \u2013 even though the US imposed a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese goods in May. She told CNBC\u2019s \u201cStreet Signs\u201d that the depreciating yuan is helping the exporters in China to export not just to the US because it dampens the impact of the tariff hike, but also help them to export to other countries. Savills, the property group and upmarket estate agent, said it had been hit by Brexit uncertainty and the US-China trade war, as it posted a 7% drop in pre-tax profits to \u00a324.7m for the six months to June. The firm said residential transactions in the UK were at their lowest level since the global financial crisis in 2008. In London, the average value of residential property sold by Savills fell 32% to \u00a32.1m, from \u00a33.2m in the same period last year. Savills added: In Asia Pacific, the imposition of Sino/US trade tariffs has affected investment confidence, particularly in Hong Kong, where office investment volumes declined by 34% during the period. And we\u2019re off. FTSE 100 index up 0.5% at 7,234 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.9% France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1.3% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.96% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.8% Portugal\u2019s PSI 20 up 1% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China has released trade figures that show a surprise 3.3% rise in exports in July, despite the escalating trade war with the US. The sharp drop in the yuan this week, beyond the key 7 per dollar mark for the first time since spring 2008, should help exporters although they are now facing fresh US tariffs from September along with weaker global demand. Exports rose 3.3% in July from a year earlier, the biggest rise since March, customs data showed. Analysts had expected a 2% decline after June\u2019s 1.3% fall. Imports declined by 5.6%, indicating weak domestic demand, although the fall was smaller than the forecast 8.3% and June\u2019s 7.3% drop. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The softer yuan is helping exports, but the drop in imports highlights the falling domestic demand. China recorded a trade surplus of $45.06bn last month, down from $50.98bn in June. The country\u2019s trade surplus with the US shrank to $27.97bn in July from June\u2019s $29.2bn. However, it reached $168.5bn in the first seven months of this year, highlighting the imbalances between the two countries that have angered Donald Trump. Washington raised tariffs on Chinese goods in May after negotiations broke down whereupon Beijing retaliated. A truce was reached in July in the year-long trade war but was shattered last Friday when Trump vowed to slap a 10% tariff on $300bn of Chinese imports from 1 September. European shares rebounded yesterday and are expected to continue their recovery today, taking their cue from Asia, where a stronger yuan has calmed nerves. The People\u2019s Bank of China fixed the yuan at a firmer-than-expected rate overnight, to limit its decline, albeit above the seven-to-one-dollar level. Japan\u2019s Nikkei up 0.4% at 20,598.11 Taiwan\u2019s TSEC 50 up 1.04% at 10,494.49 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng up 0.71% at 26,174.74 Shanghai Composite up 0.96% at 2,795.21 Australia ASX up 0.82% at 6,642.30 US stocks suffered declines yesterday as some traders piled into the safety of US government bonds, driving bond yields lower. However, they largely recovered by the end of the day and the S&amp;P 500 closed marginally higher, up 0.08% at 2,883.98 while the Dow Jones was slightly lower, down 0.09% at 26,007.07.",

      "bodyText": "It takes a certain kind of person to walk up to a bar and order a pint of Old Legover, a bottle of Piddle in the Hole and half an Old Growler. We all know the sort of person: tweed jacket worn over a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, combat shorts all year round, the sort of beard that\u2019s stiff with flecks of sausage roll and stained at the corners with nicotine. Scratches their belly button while trying to do any sort of mental arithmetic. Reads books about netherworlds and supernatural portals and giant battles. Goes home after one too many Bushy Beaver beers or pints of Leg Warmer and watches The World at War on DVD as they fall asleep on the sofa, farting like the Large Hadron Collider. Or so the stereotype goes. And yet, it seems that Camra \u2013 the Campaign for Real Ale \u2013 is trying to pull away from the lazy sexism and jocular misogyny of some of its, ahem, members, by banning all drinks with sexist names or imagery at this year\u2019s Great British beer festival, which is currently running in London. The move follows on from a new code of conduct, created by the Society of Independent Brewers (Siba) last year, proscribing any marketing deemed to be sexist or offensive. As a female ale fan, I welcome the move. According to Camra, only 17% of women identify as beer drinkers, despite making up over 50% of the potential market. There is no need for a drink \u2013 or anything, in fact \u2013 to be so delineated by gender. It\u2019s hardly the sharp end of reproductive rights or the dismantling of the patriarchy to replace a tumescent pair of breasts on your beer labels or pick a name that doesn\u2019t sound like a disappointing attempt at cunnilingus. For the past 10 years, capitalism has been co-opting the language of sexual equality and feminism in order to sell us a new flavour of mass consumerism \u2013 keyrings in the shape of Venus symbols, mugs printed with Maya Angelou quotes, T-shirts sewn by women of colour in economically developing countries under slave conditions that say Women are the Future across the tits. Too often our politics has been exploited, sanitised, repackaged and sold back to us by brands eager to profit from our desires, without letting those desires have the merest speck of an effect on their world view or work practices. Which makes it genuinely heartening to see a market respond to changes in public attitude and social acceptability, even if it is only in order to make its product and its marketing less sexist, less offensive, more inclusive, more attractive to women, men and non-binary people. If the movement for sexual equality means that the breweries making The Village Bike or Bitch Please change those names to something genuinely funny, and if that makes women and non-binary people feel more comfortable in spaces where those products are sold, then that\u2019s all right with me. I can well remember queuing in the beer tent at a folk festival in Shropshire as a 20-year-old, and the feeling of deflation and resignation as I heard a phlegm-voiced man to my right order a pint of Hairy Beaver and then snort like a pig as though this was the funniest thing he\u2019d heard all year. I\u2019m all for great names \u2013 I too have posed in front of the Crotch Crescent street sign and sniggered while walking past Bell End \u2013 but there is something slightly seedy about the image of a grown man jangling the coins in his trouser pocket a little too enthusiastically as he stares down at the pump labels covered in thick-breasted women and orders a pint of Love Muscle, Jingle Knockers, Dizzy Blonde, or Rumpy Pumpy. You may accuse me of being as dry and brittle as a Thornbush Porter, but I just find the prospect of a grown adult revelling in the wit of a drink called Shut Thi Gob, Bushy Beaver or Battleaxe a little tiresome and a tiny bit sad. If loudly announcing to the bar that you want to get your mouth round a Hairy Helmet (from Leatherbritches brewery) is as good as your pub banter gets, then that is your cross to bear. But I think we can do better. We\u2019re funnier, as a nation, than that. \u2022 Nell Frizzell is a columnist and writer",

But although he showed it to friends, including Christopher Isherwood, he didn\u2019t try to get it published, believing that he could never get away with a gay love story with a happy ending. It was finally published in 1971, a year after his death.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakhov</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The master satirist looked to have been cut off in his youth when the manuscript of his novella The Heart of a Dog was seized by the Soviet authorities in 1925. He never published another novel in his lifetime, though - unbeknown to them - he spent the rest of his life polishing and repolishing his masterpiece The Master and Margarita, which was eventually released in 1966, a mere 26 years after his death.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The publication of Toole\u2019s picaresque masterpiece 11 years after his suicide at the age of just 31 marked the birth of a cult classic, earning Toole a posthumous Pulitzer prize in 1981. It gave the world one of its most colourful literary characters, Ignatius J. Reilly, a 30-year-old flaneur living with his mother in early-1960s New Orleans whose not entirely serious search for employment sends him off on all sorts of adventures.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Suite Fran\u00e7aise by Irene N\u00e9mirovsky</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>N\u00e9mirovsky was 39 when she started work on a series of novels which she imagined as a five-part symphony. But In July 1942, having completed only the first two of the series, \u201cStorm\u201d and \u201cDolce\u201d, and an outline of the third, Captivity, she was arrested by the French police. She died a month later in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/27/auschwitz-short-history-liberation-concentration-camp-holocaust\">Auschwitz</a> of typhus. Her daughters hid the notebook containing the two novels, and their publication in a single volume as Suite Fran\u00e7aise in 2004 was a publishing sensation.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>I\u2019d Die for You: And Other Lost Stories by F Scott Fitzgerald</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Seventy-seven years after his death, the announcement of unpublished tales by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fscottfitzgerald\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a> caused hearts to flutter. I\u2019d Die for You contained works The Great Gatsby author was unable to sell in the 1930s because of its unexpected subject matter and style.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Beren and L\u00fathien by JRR Tolkien</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Barely a month goes by without the announcement of another footnote to the ever-expanding chronicles of middle earth. But Beren and L\u00fathien, written when the Lord of the Rings author returned from the first world war in 1917, held a special place in his heart. The names of the mortal Beren and the immortal elf L\u00fathien - whose illicit love is at the centre of the story - are engraved on the headstone that Tolkien shares with his wife. Their story was published in 2017, a century after it was written.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Scribbler Moon by Margaret Atwood</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Buried in a Norwegian wood as part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/05/margaret-atwood-new-work-unseen-century-future-library\">Future Library</a>, Atwood\u2019s story won\u2019t be seen until 2114 - 100 years after it was locked away.

It arguably doesn\u2019t have the directness and force of Bend Like It Beckham: there, Parminder Nagra\u2019s Jess hero worships David Beckham and wants to be a footballer; here, Javed hero worships Bruce Springsteen and \u2026 doesn\u2019t want to be a rock-star or necessarily a rock lyricist or even especially a rock journalist \u2013 but a writer. It is all affectionately managed, and there are nice cameos by Sally Phillips, Rob Brydon and Manzoor himself, glimpsed outside Luton town hall. \u2022 Blinded By the Light is in UK cinemas on 9 August and US cinemas on 14 August.",

And yet Martin was able to make a dream move to play for the Premier League club he has supported since birth; his father is the former West Ham captain Alvin Martin, who played for the club for 21 years. At 33, he has been signed to provide experienced back-up to the undisputed first-choice Lukasz Fabianski and Roberto, the Spanish keeper signed on a free transfer from Espanyol this summer. JB Angeli\u00f1o, defender, PSV Eindhoven to Manchester City, \u00a35.3m The left-back position has become worrisome for City. With Benjamin Mendy\u2019s reliability as a social media star and master of ceremonies during trophy celebrations far more assured than his fitness record, Pep Guardiola has been forced to improvise. Oleksandr Zinchenko filled in last season, just as the now departed Fabian Delph did previously. City chose to option the buy-back clause they inserted last year during the sale of the Spaniard to PSV. Angeli\u00f1o, signed as back-up, has returned to the club he first joined as a 15-year-old. By little coincidence, his re-signing adds a player who counts as \u2018homegrown\u2019 to City\u2019s squad of expensive imports.

      "body": "<h2><strong>20. Bratz: The Movie (2007)</strong></h2> \n<p>For the uninitiated, a Bratz doll is a Barbie doll without any of the intellectual heft. Accordingly, Bratz: The Movie is what Mean Girls would have been if everyone gave the impression of being there against their will. A terrible, miserable, cynical film that would have exploded if it had contained a single original idea.</p> \n<h2><strong>19. My Little Pony: The Movie (1986)</strong></h2> \n<p>Not to be confused with the 2017 movie of the same name or the myriad straight-to-video sequels, My Little Pony: The Movie rode the mid-80s wave of animated toy films that also brought us The Care Bears Movie and Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw (more of which later). In this film, the ponies are forced to band together to save their land from a sentient purple gunk with a song called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXWNV2wGu4\" title=\"\">Nothing Can Stop the Smooze</a>, which sounds exactly like what dying must feel like.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee3d1e1ffdb5d8ff568239fb32153de0f9b8cdd4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee3d1e1ffdb5d8ff568239fb32153de0f9b8cdd4/0_0_3264_1959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Irons in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Irons in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>18. Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2000)</strong></h2> \n<p>Again, not to be confused with the animated TV series, this reimagining starred the likes of Thora Birch, Jeremy Irons and one of the guys who played Jimmy Olsen in The New Adventures of Superman. The 39th worst film of all time, <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/50-worst-movies-ever-2/\" title=\"\">according to a reader poll in Empire magazine a decade ago</a>, it hasn\u2019t improved with age.</p> \n<h2><strong>17. Digimon: The Movie (2000)</strong></h2> \n<p>I\u2019m including this in the list partly because it is loosely based on a Tamagotchi competitor, and partly because it\u2019s terrible. Flung together with little attention paid to tone, plot or continuity, it was released to cash in on a fad while there was money to be made. To make matters worse, the soundtrack contains a song by the Barenaked Ladies.</p> \n<h2><strong>16. GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009)</strong></h2> \n<p>Once a concussed-looking, moss-haired dullard with no genitals and shifty eyes, the classic action figure was reimagined in GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra as a film you already forgot existed. Channing Tatum was in it, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in it, Sienna Miller was in it, but even they couldn\u2019t scrape together anything worth remembering.</p> \n<h2><strong>15. Battleship (2012)</strong></h2> \n<p>The world\u2019s dullest board game becomes the world\u2019s most pointless film. The game didn\u2019t feature aliens. It didn\u2019t feature Rihanna. It didn\u2019t feature a ship insulting the laws of physics by doing a handbrake turn in the middle of the ocean. But the film did. Oh boy, the film did.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c30e1d9deca798cf44a7dc7d5452f93941174ba\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c30e1d9deca798cf44a7dc7d5452f93941174ba/0_195_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>14. Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer (1985)</strong></h2> \n<p>Rainbow Brite is a yellow-haired doll who wears colourful clothes. However, for some reason, she is also the owner of one of the most convoluted mythologies in toy history. She is originally a girl called Wisp tasked with bringing colour to a grey world by locating a magical sphere. There\u2019s a magic belt and some Colour Children, and they\u2019re all in charge of a different colour or something. And there\u2019s a horse and a robot horse. And this film is absolutely not worth watching.</p> \n<h2><strong>13. Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw (1988)</strong></h2> \n<p>Pound Puppies were toys that looked like dogs, but in the toy-film boom of the 1980s, that was apparently enough to warrant a movie. Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw operates on the berserk assumption that the children of 1988 wanted nothing more than to watch a bunch of cartoon dogs perform pastiches of 30-year-old rock\u2019n\u2019roll standards. <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=toyadaptation.htm\" title=\"\">It is the lowest-grossing toy-based film ever theatrically released</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>12. The Garbage Pail Kids (1985)</strong></h2> \n<p>Where to begin with this? First came the Cabbage Patch Kids, a range of unintentionally terrifying dolls with giant faces. Then came the Garbage Pail Kids, a line of flatulent, filthy trading cards that mocked the Cabbage Patch Kids, with names such as Junkfood John and Intense Payne. Then came The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, a Gremlins imitation about some dolls that look like they belong in the final scene of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.<a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/garbage_pail_kids_movie\" title=\"\"> It is so bad, it has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes</a>. It was also the third film I ever rented on VHS.</p> \n<h2><strong>11. Trolls (2016)</strong></h2> \n<p>Are Trolls even toys? Aren\u2019t they just pencil toppers, or ornaments designed for murderers to collect? Whatever, they made a Trolls film, and it doubled as a jukebox musical for songs that deserved much better than to end up in a forgettable-to-annoying animated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru0K8uYEZWw\" title=\"\">Justin Timberlake vehicle</a>. Even my four-year-old hates this, and he\u2019s four, for the love of God.</p> \n<h2><strong>10. Transformers (2007)</strong></h2> \n<p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut Transformers is terrible. Every Transformers film has been an incomprehensible, overlong mishmash of damp mythology, impenetrable battle sequences and scene after scene where the camera uncomfortably leers over the bodies of young women. The Transformers series is utterly and unforgivably without any merit whatsoever. Why the hell is it all the way up at No 10?\u201d My answer is this: I agree, but cut me a break. I\u2019m dying here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08a28e6938c129e12600f8cdc8740d7ce16a4112\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08a28e6938c129e12600f8cdc8740d7ce16a4112/0_102_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Willis in GI Joe: Retaliation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce Willis in GI Joe: Retaliation.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaimie Trueblood</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>9. GI Joe: Retaliation (2013)</strong></h2> \n<p>You thought GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra was forgettable? Guess what \u2013 they made a sequel, and it was even more forgettable. Do you remember GI Joe: Retaliation? Do you remember that London got completely levelled in it? Do you remember that Bruce Willis plays General Colton, who was actually the first ever GI Joe figure back in the 60s? Do you remember that the lead actor was the goddamn Rock? No, me neither.</p> \n<h2><strong>8. Jem and the Holograms (2015)</strong></h2> \n<p>Jem is the singer in a band. Her best friend is a \u201cholographic computer\u201d called Synergy. This is the most 1980s premise for a toy ever, so of course it makes perfect sense that it wasn\u2019t turned into a film until 2015. The resulting movie had the worst opening of the year and the worst opening ever for a film released by a major studio. Universal pulled it from screens after a fortnight, and the <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/director-jon-chu-gives-brutally-honest-talk-day-after-jem-and-the-holograms-bombs-56219/\" title=\"\">director claimed to have received death threats</a>. So why is it all the way up at No 8? Like I said, all these films are terrible. I really can\u2019t reiterate that enough.</p> \n<h2><strong>7. Care Bears: The Movie (1985)</strong></h2> \n<p>You probably have the Care Bears to blame for this whole films-based-on-toys nightmare. The Care Bears Movie \u2013 about a group of bears who live on a cloud and hypnotise the depressed into being happy or something \u2013 contained original plot-specific songs by Carole King and made its money back 16 times over. And you know what? It\u2019s quite good. Sue me.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2eebf2d448759fd55be92e0392f37cfa1980d51\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2eebf2d448759fd55be92e0392f37cfa1980d51/0_32_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lego Batman Movie \u2013 the best Batman film for a long time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lego Batman Movie \u2013 the best Batman film for a long time.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>6. The Lego Batman Movie (2017)</strong></h2> \n<p>Lego Batman was the breakout star of The Lego Movie, thanks to the hilarious way he communicated that he was a depressed orphan. He was given a spin-off as a result and, while it never quite hit the heights of The Lego Movie, it was still the best Batman film in about a decade.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Clue (1985)</strong></h2> \n<p>Board games tend not to translate very well to the big screen (see Battleship), but Clue just about managed to buck the trend. Clue took Cluedo and turned it into a work of high farce, with the likes of Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn and Lesley Ann Warren yucking it up for all they were worth. Three endings were shot for this film, each declaring a different murderer; if you saw it in a cinema, the ending was chosen at random. If you watch it now, you get to watch all three in a row, which is very confusing if it\u2019s on TV in 1992, and you\u2019re a helpless child.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc688bd46a2e379025d8a48849cea0a5c6207a72\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc688bd46a2e379025d8a48849cea0a5c6207a72/0_34_1755_1053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Langella \u2026 one hell of a Skeletor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Langella \u2026 one hell of a Skeletor.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>4. Masters of the Universe (1987)</strong></h2> \n<p>Oh sure, it\u2019s flawed. Oh sure, it grabs all the fun intergalactic action of the cartoon and transplants it to dreary old mid-80s US. Oh sure, it invented the abomination that was Gwildor because Orko was too difficult to get right on-screen. And the plot revolves too heavily around synthesisers. And it contains the single most generic James Tolkan role ever committed to screen. But you know what? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/20/frank-langella-make-love-reality-machine\" title=\"\">Frank Langella</a> was one hell of a Skeletor. I will die on this hill.</p> \n<h2><strong>3. The Lego Movie (2014)</strong></h2> \n<p>When it was first announced, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/11/lego-film-subversive-countercultural\" title=\"\">The Lego Movie</a> seemed like an act of pure craven greed. So what an amazing surprise to discover that The Lego Movie was an incredible vehicle for the toy \u2013 show me a more tactile-looking animation and I\u2019ll eat my hat \u2013 and a sly critique of the toy\u2019s biggest fans. For what is Will Ferrell\u2019s Lord Business if not an uptight, overwrought, order-obsessed Lego fanatic? This film could have been No 1, had all the sequels and spin-offs not diluted its punchy appeal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f121352ec4723bb2cb4ec9d4a984b668229c675\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f121352ec4723bb2cb4ec9d4a984b668229c675/0_16_2639_1584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Transformers \u2013 the less dreadful one.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transformers \u2013 the less dreadful one.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hasbro/Marvel/Kobal</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>2. Transformers: The Movie (1986)</strong></h2> \n<p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut didn\u2019t you already do Transformers?\u201d And, yes, I did, but only the Michael Bay live-action horror-shows. The animated Transformers movie, by comparison, is a masterpiece. This is the film, remember, that had an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3PJJOylp_s\" title=\"\">incredibly child-unfriendly soundtrack</a>. This is the film in which Orson Welles played a robot who could turn into a planet. This is the film where \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 Optimus Prime was murdered in the first act. Did nobody think of the toy sales?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqtjHWlM4lQ\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DqtjHWlM4lQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The original Mars Attacks! trailer\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>1. Mars Attacks! (1996)</strong></h2> \n<p>Based on a 1962 trading card series, Mars Attacks! is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/21/on-the-set-of-dumbo-with-tim-burton-like-meeting-up-with-your-teenage-boyfriend\" title=\"\">Tim Burton</a> at his absolute giddiest. Gone was the creeping melancholy of Edward Scissorhands. Still to come was his descent into Disney yes-man. And here, right in the middle, is a silly, goofy, star-filled pastiche of whatever Burton felt like pastiching on any given day. At the time, it was his worst-reviewed film to that point, but to watch it now is to see a sense of aggressive playfulness you just don\u2019t often get to witness. Tom Jones shouts: \u201cJESUS CHRIST!\u201d at a Martian. Honestly, what more do you people want?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "20. Bratz: The Movie (2007) For the uninitiated, a Bratz doll is a Barbie doll without any of the intellectual heft. Accordingly, Bratz: The Movie is what Mean Girls would have been if everyone gave the impression of being there against their will. A terrible, miserable, cynical film that would have exploded if it had contained a single original idea. 19. My Little Pony: The Movie (1986) Not to be confused with the 2017 movie of the same name or the myriad straight-to-video sequels, My Little Pony: The Movie rode the mid-80s wave of animated toy films that also brought us The Care Bears Movie and Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw (more of which later). In this film, the ponies are forced to band together to save their land from a sentient purple gunk with a song called Nothing Can Stop the Smooze, which sounds exactly like what dying must feel like. 18. Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2000) Again, not to be confused with the animated TV series, this reimagining starred the likes of Thora Birch, Jeremy Irons and one of the guys who played Jimmy Olsen in The New Adventures of Superman. The 39th worst film of all time, according to a reader poll in Empire magazine a decade ago, it hasn\u2019t improved with age. 17. Digimon: The Movie (2000) I\u2019m including this in the list partly because it is loosely based on a Tamagotchi competitor, and partly because it\u2019s terrible. Flung together with little attention paid to tone, plot or continuity, it was released to cash in on a fad while there was money to be made. To make matters worse, the soundtrack contains a song by the Barenaked Ladies. 16. GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009) Once a concussed-looking, moss-haired dullard with no genitals and shifty eyes, the classic action figure was reimagined in GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra as a film you already forgot existed. Channing Tatum was in it, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in it, Sienna Miller was in it, but even they couldn\u2019t scrape together anything worth remembering. 15. Battleship (2012) The world\u2019s dullest board game becomes the world\u2019s most pointless film. The game didn\u2019t feature aliens. It didn\u2019t feature Rihanna. It didn\u2019t feature a ship insulting the laws of physics by doing a handbrake turn in the middle of the ocean. But the film did. Oh boy, the film did. 14. Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer (1985) Rainbow Brite is a yellow-haired doll who wears colourful clothes. However, for some reason, she is also the owner of one of the most convoluted mythologies in toy history. She is originally a girl called Wisp tasked with bringing colour to a grey world by locating a magical sphere. There\u2019s a magic belt and some Colour Children, and they\u2019re all in charge of a different colour or something. And there\u2019s a horse and a robot horse. And this film is absolutely not worth watching. 13. Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw (1988) Pound Puppies were toys that looked like dogs, but in the toy-film boom of the 1980s, that was apparently enough to warrant a movie. Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw operates on the berserk assumption that the children of 1988 wanted nothing more than to watch a bunch of cartoon dogs perform pastiches of 30-year-old rock\u2019n\u2019roll standards. It is the lowest-grossing toy-based film ever theatrically released. 12. The Garbage Pail Kids (1985) Where to begin with this? First came the Cabbage Patch Kids, a range of unintentionally terrifying dolls with giant faces. Then came the Garbage Pail Kids, a line of flatulent, filthy trading cards that mocked the Cabbage Patch Kids, with names such as Junkfood John and Intense Payne. Then came The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, a Gremlins imitation about some dolls that look like they belong in the final scene of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It is so bad, it has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was also the third film I ever rented on VHS. 11. Trolls (2016) Are Trolls even toys? Aren\u2019t they just pencil toppers, or ornaments designed for murderers to collect? Whatever, they made a Trolls film, and it doubled as a jukebox musical for songs that deserved much better than to end up in a forgettable-to-annoying animated Justin Timberlake vehicle. Even my four-year-old hates this, and he\u2019s four, for the love of God. 10. Transformers (2007) I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut Transformers is terrible. Every Transformers film has been an incomprehensible, overlong mishmash of damp mythology, impenetrable battle sequences and scene after scene where the camera uncomfortably leers over the bodies of young women. The Transformers series is utterly and unforgivably without any merit whatsoever. Why the hell is it all the way up at No 10?\u201d My answer is this: I agree, but cut me a break. I\u2019m dying here. 9. GI Joe: Retaliation (2013) You thought GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra was forgettable? Guess what \u2013 they made a sequel, and it was even more forgettable. Do you remember GI Joe: Retaliation? Do you remember that London got completely levelled in it? Do you remember that Bruce Willis plays General Colton, who was actually the first ever GI Joe figure back in the 60s? Do you remember that the lead actor was the goddamn Rock? No, me neither. 8. Jem and the Holograms (2015) Jem is the singer in a band. Her best friend is a \u201cholographic computer\u201d called Synergy. This is the most 1980s premise for a toy ever, so of course it makes perfect sense that it wasn\u2019t turned into a film until 2015. The resulting movie had the worst opening of the year and the worst opening ever for a film released by a major studio. Universal pulled it from screens after a fortnight, and the director claimed to have received death threats. So why is it all the way up at No 8? Like I said, all these films are terrible. I really can\u2019t reiterate that enough. 7. Care Bears: The Movie (1985) You probably have the Care Bears to blame for this whole films-based-on-toys nightmare. The Care Bears Movie \u2013 about a group of bears who live on a cloud and hypnotise the depressed into being happy or something \u2013 contained original plot-specific songs by Carole King and made its money back 16 times over. And you know what? It\u2019s quite good. Sue me. 6. The Lego Batman Movie (2017) Lego Batman was the breakout star of The Lego Movie, thanks to the hilarious way he communicated that he was a depressed orphan. He was given a spin-off as a result and, while it never quite hit the heights of The Lego Movie, it was still the best Batman film in about a decade. 5. Clue (1985) Board games tend not to translate very well to the big screen (see Battleship), but Clue just about managed to buck the trend. Clue took Cluedo and turned it into a work of high farce, with the likes of Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn and Lesley Ann Warren yucking it up for all they were worth. Three endings were shot for this film, each declaring a different murderer; if you saw it in a cinema, the ending was chosen at random. If you watch it now, you get to watch all three in a row, which is very confusing if it\u2019s on TV in 1992, and you\u2019re a helpless child. 4. Masters of the Universe (1987) Oh sure, it\u2019s flawed. Oh sure, it grabs all the fun intergalactic action of the cartoon and transplants it to dreary old mid-80s US. Oh sure, it invented the abomination that was Gwildor because Orko was too difficult to get right on-screen. And the plot revolves too heavily around synthesisers. And it contains the single most generic James Tolkan role ever committed to screen. But you know what? Frank Langella was one hell of a Skeletor. I will die on this hill. 3. The Lego Movie (2014) When it was first announced, The Lego Movie seemed like an act of pure craven greed. So what an amazing surprise to discover that The Lego Movie was an incredible vehicle for the toy \u2013 show me a more tactile-looking animation and I\u2019ll eat my hat \u2013 and a sly critique of the toy\u2019s biggest fans. For what is Will Ferrell\u2019s Lord Business if not an uptight, overwrought, order-obsessed Lego fanatic? This film could have been No 1, had all the sequels and spin-offs not diluted its punchy appeal. 2. Transformers: The Movie (1986) I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut didn\u2019t you already do Transformers?\u201d And, yes, I did, but only the Michael Bay live-action horror-shows. The animated Transformers movie, by comparison, is a masterpiece. This is the film, remember, that had an incredibly child-unfriendly soundtrack. This is the film in which Orson Welles played a robot who could turn into a planet. This is the film where \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 Optimus Prime was murdered in the first act. Did nobody think of the toy sales? 1. Mars Attacks! (1996) Based on a 1962 trading card series, Mars Attacks! is Tim Burton at his absolute giddiest. Gone was the creeping melancholy of Edward Scissorhands. Still to come was his descent into Disney yes-man. And here, right in the middle, is a silly, goofy, star-filled pastiche of whatever Burton felt like pastiching on any given day. At the time, it was his worst-reviewed film to that point, but to watch it now is to see a sense of aggressive playfulness you just don\u2019t often get to witness. Tom Jones shouts: \u201cJESUS CHRIST!\u201d at a Martian. Honestly, what more do you people want?",

Javi Gracia not only proved himself to be tactically astute and popular with both fans and media, his ability to keep his squad relatively content and well motivated over a long season convinced some at the club to declare him a master of man-management. It may have ended disappointingly, with three successive league defeats dropping them into a final position of 11<sup>th</sup>, followed by that miserable shellacking at the hands of Manchester City at Wembley, but there can be no doubt that it was the club\u2019s most convincing season since promotion in 2015. So, why change?</p> \n<p>While transfer deadline day has brought a squall of rumours the summer so far has been quiet, the club concluding a couple of free transfers, led by the eye-catching arrival of Danny Welbeck, while the \u00a35.5m spent to bring the 29-year-old centre-back Craig Dawson from West Brom represents the sum of Watford\u2019s confirmed spending on first-team players over the past two windows.</p> \n<p>Like the signing of Ben Foster, who arrived from the same club last summer, Dawson demonstrates Watford\u2019s belief that experienced campaigners at domestic clubs can sometimes rival South American teenagers for value. Dawson will bring experience and quality to defence as well as being an attacking threat from set pieces \u2013 his 12 top-flight goals put him among the 30 top-scoring centre-backs in Premier League history \u2013 and without being a particularly eye-catching or inspiring signing, he will improve what was a problem area last season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/watford-zip/giv-3902uYtyla69UsCa\" data-alt=\"Last five seasons\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/watford-zip/giv-3902uYtyla69UsCa\">Last five seasons</a> \n</figure> \n<p>For the second successive summer, the addition of pace and quality in wide areas was another priority. Last year they signed Gerard Deulofeu, in theory to meet this need, but he was promptly converted into a central attacker and, having become the club\u2019s top scorer, is likely to stay there. The search for another winger led them to Rennes, with whom negotiations over a club-record deal for Isma\u00efla Sarr have been ongoing for several weeks without \u2013 just hours from the end of the transfer window \u2013 reaching a conclusion.</p> \n<p>The 21-year-old is an exciting talent: tall, fast and tricky, the Senegal international can play on the right or the left \u2013 though he favours the former \u2013 and cross with either foot. He certainly seems capable of stretching defences in a way that Will Hughes, who was their first choice on the right last season, cannot. A late move for PSV\u2019s Steven Bergwijn demonstrates the club\u2019s resolve to improve their options in this position. On the other flank the classy but inconsistent Roberto Pereyra will find his place threatened by the arrival of Welbeck, who has the advantage of offering greater goalscoring threat but could also play at centre-forward.</p> \n<p>Sarr is particularly adept at cutting infield before playing incisive passes forward, meaning that his arrival would not necessarily force a significant tactical change: Javi Gracia favoured a narrow 4-4-2 last season in which both wide midfielders, normally Hughes and Pereyra, spent much of their time infield, and the full-backs overlapped to provide width. It is notable that each of the three full-backs who saw regular game time both attempted and completed at least as many crosses last season as Hughes and Pereyra managed together (even Adam Masina, the reserve left-back, crossed more often than Hughes, who started nearly three times as many games in a more attacking position). The ideal recruit would be able to fill this same role, or that of a more conventional winger.</p> \n<p>They have also signed the 19-year-old former Manchester City midfielder Tom Dele-Bashiru, who was out of contract, on a presumably generous six-year deal. It is easy to see what attracted them to the Nigerian youth international, who is strong on the ball, has excellent technique and an impressive burst of pace. It is less easy to see how they expect to use him, with central midfield the one position in which they possess an abundance of riches.</p> \n<p>Despite Everton\u2019s advances Abdoulaye Doucoure remains in Hertfordshire, having declared in January that \u201cI think I will leave Watford\u201d and \u201cjoin a club playing at European level \u2013 my priority is a club in the Champions League\u201d. Paris Saint-Germain, whose advances he was perhaps anticipating, moved instead for Everton\u2019s Idrissa Gueye, and the Merseyside club are unable to offer the European football he seeks. Thus his partnership with \u00c9tienne Capoue so far remains intact; Nathaniel Chalobah, Tom Cleverley and Domingos Quina provide excellent backup, now augmented by Dele-Bashiru and, assuming a winger is found, a displaced Hughes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/watford-zip/giv-3902sbPohVqyz8p8\" data-alt=\"WDL\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/watford-zip/giv-3902sbPohVqyz8p8\">WDL</a> \n</figure> \n<p>A year ago the attack was the most significant area of concern, but over the last season this has eased enough to allow the club to take a calculated gamble on an injury-prone forward in Welbeck. Across all competitions last season Deulofeu scored 0.45 goals per 90 minutes, his move to the centre proving unexpectedly successful. Even more surprisingly that figure was matched by Andre Gray, who compared with his first season in Hertfordshire was both more prolific and considerably more impressive in general play. Troy Deeney scored less frequently but his leadership, his work ethic and his contributions outside the penalty area continue to demand his inclusion. Welbeck, if that gamble pays off, is an excellent player who should be at his peak and will further improve their forward line.</p> \n<p>There is also the prospect of Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s scheduled arrival from Fluminense in January. Watford completed a \u00a32m deal for the then obscure 17-year-old last October, seven months before he made his first-team debut, which has come to look like money extraordinarily well spent. Should he succeed in getting a work permit \u2013 his low fee and presumably low wages will complicate this process, but probably not terminally \u2013 Watford will gain in mid-season a young player of enormous potential, a gifted finisher and a fine dribbler, good in the air despite not being particularly tall and with the potential to have an instant impact.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"68bc874c-c080-4efb-98c1-cd42665645cc\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>No 1:</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-2019-20-preview-arsenal-unai-emery-champions-league-pepe\">Arsenal</a><br><b>No 2:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-201920-preview-no-2-aston-villa\">Aston Villa</a><br><b>No 3:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-2019-20-preview-bournemouth-eddie-howe\">Bournemouth</a><br><b>No 4:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-201920-preview-no-4-brighton\">Brighton</a><br><b>No 5:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-5-burnley\">Burnley</a><br><b>No 6:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-6-chelsea\">Chelsea</a><br><b>No 7:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-2019-20-preview-crystal-palace-hodgson-zaha\">Crystal Palace</a><br><b>No 8:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-201920-preview-no-8-everton\">Everton</a><br><b>No 9:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-2019-20-preview-leicester-brendan-rodgers-perez-tielemans\">Leicester City</a><br><b>No 10:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-201920-preview-no-10-liverpool\">Liverpool</a><br><b>No 11:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-11-manchester-city\">Manchester City</a><br><b>No 12:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-12-manchester-united\">Manchester United</a><br><b>No 13:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-13-newcastle-united\">Newcastle United</a><br><b>No 14:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-14-norwich-city\">Norwich City</a><br><b>No 15:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-15-sheffield-united\">Sheffield United</a><br><b>No 16:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-16-southampton\">Southampton</a><br><b>No 17:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-17-tottenham\">Tottenham Hotspur</a><br><b>No 18:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-18-watford\">Watford</a><br><b>No 19:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-19-west-ham\">West Ham</a><br><b>No 20:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-20-wolves\">Wolves</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Many of the teams that finished around them last season have invested far more heavily this summer, but Watford are gambling on their squad\u2019s strength and Gracia\u2019s ability to extract it.

Synths shudder, simmer and hiss as themes such as Mirkwood and Rats, from the series\u2019 recent third season, build towards cacophonous climaxes, elevated by impressive visuals: Stein and Dixon are barely visible throughout, hidden in a wreckage of frayed cables, behind clouds of smoke and glitching red lights. Whether or not the music can captivate detached from the Spielbergian romance of the Duffers\u2019 visuals is down to personal preference. But by the time their creeping showpiece, the show\u2019s intro music, reaches its giddy peak, it\u2019s hard not to be drawn in. \u2022 Meltdown is at the Royal Festival Hall, London, until 11 August.",

Tear through the humdrum carapace of everyday existence, it suggested, and you too might be able to redefine yourself as a kung fu-kicking babe magnet in shades and leather. Dive down the rabbit hole and available upgrades might include enhanced charisma, new vocabularies, and even the ability to see without one\u2019s eyes. Almost anything was possible within the Matrix \u2013 damn, give Boris Johnson the Red Pill and send him blustering after the White Rabbit, and he might even be able to solve Brexit.</p> <p>The problem here is that even the Wachowskis were not able to repeat the success of The Matrix with sequels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/16/cannes2003.cannesfilmfestival1\">Reloaded</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,1079198,00.html\">Revolutions</a>, which means it\u2019s difficult to imagine how anyone else can. With its heady philosophical ideas increasingly torpedoed by big-budget action motifs as the series stumbled towards its disappointing conclusion, the trilogy was eventually fully absorbed into Hollywood\u2019s own matrix of blandness, like one of the many annoying clones created by Hugo Weaving\u2019s nefarious Agent Smith.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e4950a041cd79f45a864ae49e663310ecb95bfa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4950a041cd79f45a864ae49e663310ecb95bfa8/0_0_2200_1001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Action overload \u2026 multiple agents, played by Hugo Weaving, attack Keanu Reeves in The Matrix Reloaded.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"455\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Action overload \u2026 multiple agents, played by Hugo Weaving, attack Keanu Reeves in The Matrix Reloaded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A truly visionary writer-director \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/24/denis-villeneuve-sicario-cannes-2015\">Denis Villeneuve</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/may/12/christopher-nolan-at-cannes-i-want-the-young-to-sit-in-awe-at-2001-a-space-odyssey\">Christopher Nolan</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/11/alex-garland-ex-machina-interview-the-beach-28-days-later\">Alex Garland</a> spring to mind \u2013 might be able to wring new life from the concept, but of these only Villeneuve, the Canadian director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/13/the-50-top-films-of-2017-no-8-blade-runner-2049\">Blade Runner 2049</a>, has shown any sign in recent times of being keen on uploading himself to the Hollywood sequel mainframe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/i-am-mother-review-all-female-netflix-thriller-is-a-solid-sci-fi-watch\">I Am Mother</a>\u2019s Grant Sputore, District 9\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/02/oats-studios-secret-film-lab-sidestepping-hollywood\">Neill Blomkamp</a> and Moon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/23/how-we-made-sci-fi-film-moon\">Duncan Jones</a> would be other names to get fans excited, though only the first of those has an unblemished CV. Whoever takes it on should be told to focus first and foremost on the ideas that made The Matrix so intriguing, rather than blowing audiences away with giant FX cannons.</p> <p>Imagine, for a moment, if the Wachowskis\u2019 first movie had been left as a standalone episode. It might well have developed even greater cult status by now \u2013 just as 1982\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/07/2\">Blade Runner</a> did after being allowed to percolate through the discerning sci-fi fan\u2019s senses for the best part of three decades.

      "bodyText": "It was surely inevitable that Hollywood would eventually return to the world of The Matrix. After all, the Wachowskis\u2019 turn-of-the-century cyberpunk trilogy makes clear that the titular virtual-reality universe is regularly rebooted when it all gets a little too crazy in cyberspace. There\u2019s even provision for Keanu Reeves\u2019s Neo to be brought back with a new face, Doctor Who style, as 2003\u2019s Matrix Reloaded revealed the existence of umpteen previous digital messiahs, all going by the same name, before the latest iteration arrived on the scene to bullet-time the machines into submission. Rumours have been swirling around a new film since at least 2017, when Ready Player One\u2019s Zach Penn was reported to be writing an episode for studio Warner Bros that would cast Michael B Jordan as the lead. Now, as the original 1999 film returns to US cinemas, writer-director Lilly Wachowski, who oversaw the original trilogy alongside her sister Lana, has given the concept her blessing (while suggesting she is too busy to get involved herself). \u201cI like it when stories go out into the world and then come back to you in different ways,\u201d Wachowski told /Film. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s what storytelling is all about. I\u2019m part of a bigger thing. I don\u2019t have any ownership over stuff like that, so whatever story anybody wants to tell, I can\u2019t wait to hear. I hope it\u2019s better than the original.\u201d The Matrix introduced the concept of life as a simulation designed to keep humanity from rebelling, a sort of virtual opium of the masses for the 21st century. Tear through the humdrum carapace of everyday existence, it suggested, and you too might be able to redefine yourself as a kung fu-kicking babe magnet in shades and leather. Dive down the rabbit hole and available upgrades might include enhanced charisma, new vocabularies, and even the ability to see without one\u2019s eyes. Almost anything was possible within the Matrix \u2013 damn, give Boris Johnson the Red Pill and send him blustering after the White Rabbit, and he might even be able to solve Brexit. The problem here is that even the Wachowskis were not able to repeat the success of The Matrix with sequels Reloaded and Revolutions, which means it\u2019s difficult to imagine how anyone else can. With its heady philosophical ideas increasingly torpedoed by big-budget action motifs as the series stumbled towards its disappointing conclusion, the trilogy was eventually fully absorbed into Hollywood\u2019s own matrix of blandness, like one of the many annoying clones created by Hugo Weaving\u2019s nefarious Agent Smith. A truly visionary writer-director \u2013 Denis Villeneuve, Christopher Nolan or Alex Garland spring to mind \u2013 might be able to wring new life from the concept, but of these only Villeneuve, the Canadian director of Blade Runner 2049, has shown any sign in recent times of being keen on uploading himself to the Hollywood sequel mainframe. I Am Mother\u2019s Grant Sputore, District 9\u2019s Neill Blomkamp and Moon\u2019s Duncan Jones would be other names to get fans excited, though only the first of those has an unblemished CV. Whoever takes it on should be told to focus first and foremost on the ideas that made The Matrix so intriguing, rather than blowing audiences away with giant FX cannons. Imagine, for a moment, if the Wachowskis\u2019 first movie had been left as a standalone episode. It might well have developed even greater cult status by now \u2013 just as 1982\u2019s Blade Runner did after being allowed to percolate through the discerning sci-fi fan\u2019s senses for the best part of three decades. The fact this did not happen stands as testament to the dangers of studios greenlighting sequels before they are really ready to emerge fully formed into the light. There is a reason James Cameron has spent more than a decade working on sequels to (the far less iconic) Avatar, and that Ready Player One writer Ernest Cline is planning a new novel before even considering venturing back into the brand-heavy virtual world brought to the big screen by Steven Spielberg last year. Get these followups wrong, and there is a serious danger of tarnishing the original episode. The Matrix\u2019s enigma, like the Carrollian underworld that partly inspired it, is intrinsic to its value as a cultural totem. That first movie was so inspiring because it introduced us to a superbly stylised, incredibly cool inner world that it seemed we would never be able to fully understand. Once we know the functions of Smith, the Oracle and Neo himself within the fabric of this digital labyrinth, they become far less intriguing. Once we see what the machines actually look like they become far less horrifying \u2013 the relentless Sentinels introduced in Reloaded, tunnelling their way towards Zion, are boring machines in more than one sense.

      "body": "<p>In one of the stories in Bryan Washington\u2019s debut collection Lot, two men share a meal then go upstairs to have sex. After every public event where he has read that story, Washington says that someone has come up to him afterwards to tell him it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve even considered that two men of colour might have sex with each other.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I read that particular section,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause for that moment you have to \u2013 as a reader or as a listener or as an observer in that audience \u2013 give agency and give a sense of humanity to two young men from communities you may or may not think of or see on a daily basis, let alone think of as engaging in intimate acts with one another.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/07/lot-bryan-washington-review-tough-tender-houston-short-stories\">Lot by Bryan Washington review \u2013 tough but tender stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It could be easy to read Lot as a reflection of life in Trump\u2019s America, where questions of identity are increasingly urgent. But while \u201crace will always be a factor living in the States\u201d, Washington says the collection circles around the issue of race so tightly because of his interest in the idea of community \u2013 \u201chow those communities interact with one another, how they don\u2019t, why they don\u2019t or why they do. And I don\u2019t know that you can do that without addressing race.\u201d</p> <p>About half of the stories in Lot are told by a young, gay man who embodies Houston\u2019s remarkable diversity \u2013 \u201ctoo dark for the blancos, too Latin for the blacks\u201d \u2013 and works at the hardscrabble end of the restaurant business. He sweeps under the fryers, washes dishes and hooks up with men, ranging from the white guy learning Spanish so he can get a promotion, to the Guatemalan with no papers whose family came to the US because his sister was sick. The other stories assemble a cast of drug dealers, male prostitutes and fast-food servers, ranging through districts from Shepherd to Alief, and all offering a portrait of life at the sharp end of a city undergoing rapid change.</p> <p>Born in Kentucky in 1993, Washington has lived in Houston since his family moved to the city in the mid-1990s. He began writing Lot in 2016 with an ambition to chart the city\u2019s geography, \u201cjust so I could establish I was someone who knew what was happening in the city\u201d. There are no zoning laws in Houston, which means people from many walks of life can be found living side by side, \u201cso you get a lot of different experiences that are parallel or perpendicular to yours\u201d.</p> <p>The fast pace of change in Houston lends Lot a bittersweet air; Washington says many of the places so vividly brought to life in his stories, depicted on the cusp of gentrification, have been irrevocably changed in reality, making his stories \u201ctime capsules for some of these particular neighbourhoods\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re constantly coming out, you\u2019re constantly negotiating the question of how much of yourself to reveal in any given place or time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While writing, Washington realised Houston is so diverse, so various, \u201cthat there is no singular experience \u2013 there\u2019s no story I could have written that would have encapsulated what it meant or what it could mean to live in the city. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any author who\u2019s going to do that, just because there\u2019s such a multiplicity of experiences in this particular city.\u201d </p> <p>He insists on these specifics again and again, framing his answers with a recognition of his own \u201cparticular experience\u201d, his own \u201cpoint in time\u201d \u2013 a courtesy he argues is rarely extended to marginalised characters in contemporary American literary fiction, where if a character is poor, that often becomes \u201cthe defining characteristic of their being\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t come from money, I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s like,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do know there is a multiplicity of experiences to be had, irrespective of your economic stratum at any one point in time.\u201d Many authors either \u201chaven\u2019t met those people and that\u2019s very clear in their writing,\u201d he adds, \u201cor they have met those people and they simply don\u2019t view them as human \u2013 which I think is another side of the same coin.\u201d</p> <p>Homophobia is a personal experience Washington was keen to depict. He wasn\u2019t interested in writing a collection where a character comes out and then everything\u2019s great \u201cbecause that\u2019s not reality. You\u2019re constantly coming out, you\u2019re constantly negotiating the question of how much of yourself to reveal in any given place or time.

      "bodyText": "In one of the stories in Bryan Washington\u2019s debut collection Lot, two men share a meal then go upstairs to have sex. After every public event where he has read that story, Washington says that someone has come up to him afterwards to tell him it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve even considered that two men of colour might have sex with each other. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I read that particular section,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause for that moment you have to \u2013 as a reader or as a listener or as an observer in that audience \u2013 give agency and give a sense of humanity to two young men from communities you may or may not think of or see on a daily basis, let alone think of as engaging in intimate acts with one another.\u201d It could be easy to read Lot as a reflection of life in Trump\u2019s America, where questions of identity are increasingly urgent. But while \u201crace will always be a factor living in the States\u201d, Washington says the collection circles around the issue of race so tightly because of his interest in the idea of community \u2013 \u201chow those communities interact with one another, how they don\u2019t, why they don\u2019t or why they do. And I don\u2019t know that you can do that without addressing race.\u201d About half of the stories in Lot are told by a young, gay man who embodies Houston\u2019s remarkable diversity \u2013 \u201ctoo dark for the blancos, too Latin for the blacks\u201d \u2013 and works at the hardscrabble end of the restaurant business. He sweeps under the fryers, washes dishes and hooks up with men, ranging from the white guy learning Spanish so he can get a promotion, to the Guatemalan with no papers whose family came to the US because his sister was sick. The other stories assemble a cast of drug dealers, male prostitutes and fast-food servers, ranging through districts from Shepherd to Alief, and all offering a portrait of life at the sharp end of a city undergoing rapid change. Born in Kentucky in 1993, Washington has lived in Houston since his family moved to the city in the mid-1990s. He began writing Lot in 2016 with an ambition to chart the city\u2019s geography, \u201cjust so I could establish I was someone who knew what was happening in the city\u201d. There are no zoning laws in Houston, which means people from many walks of life can be found living side by side, \u201cso you get a lot of different experiences that are parallel or perpendicular to yours\u201d. The fast pace of change in Houston lends Lot a bittersweet air; Washington says many of the places so vividly brought to life in his stories, depicted on the cusp of gentrification, have been irrevocably changed in reality, making his stories \u201ctime capsules for some of these particular neighbourhoods\u201d. While writing, Washington realised Houston is so diverse, so various, \u201cthat there is no singular experience \u2013 there\u2019s no story I could have written that would have encapsulated what it meant or what it could mean to live in the city. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any author who\u2019s going to do that, just because there\u2019s such a multiplicity of experiences in this particular city.\u201d He insists on these specifics again and again, framing his answers with a recognition of his own \u201cparticular experience\u201d, his own \u201cpoint in time\u201d \u2013 a courtesy he argues is rarely extended to marginalised characters in contemporary American literary fiction, where if a character is poor, that often becomes \u201cthe defining characteristic of their being\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t come from money, I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s like,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do know there is a multiplicity of experiences to be had, irrespective of your economic stratum at any one point in time.\u201d Many authors either \u201chaven\u2019t met those people and that\u2019s very clear in their writing,\u201d he adds, \u201cor they have met those people and they simply don\u2019t view them as human \u2013 which I think is another side of the same coin.\u201d Homophobia is a personal experience Washington was keen to depict. He wasn\u2019t interested in writing a collection where a character comes out and then everything\u2019s great \u201cbecause that\u2019s not reality. You\u2019re constantly coming out, you\u2019re constantly negotiating the question of how much of yourself to reveal in any given place or time. Each character negotiates that question and those aspects in different ways. A goal of mine was to show a handful of different experiences without trying to state or subject them as being \u2018the\u2019 experience, because that doesn\u2019t exist. There are as many of those as there are people.\u201d Fiction can open a window into other lives, but Washington says that\u2019s not enough for some of the communities he writes about \u2013 there is still \u201cpractical work that needs to be done\u201d to address issues such as access to healthy food. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for someone to read Lot and to acknowledge that there are food deserts, let\u2019s say, in certain neighbourhoods that are depicted throughout the collection \u2013 to see that and to acknowledge that, to accept it and to talk about it with their friends. But if they aren\u2019t doing the work or doing what they can to mitigate the presence of those food deserts, then what is it doing?\u201d While his collection may be rooted in reality, Washington is suspicious of questions surrounding his own connection with the people and the places that fill his work. \u201cThere\u2019s a way in which for writers of colour and specifically queer writers of colour their work is looked to as a sort of ethnological guide in lieu of a work of fiction,\u201d he says. But for Washington, to read Lot merely as a report on other lives is to miss the point of writing stories: the joy of making things up. \u201cHaving the chance to try and build another world and to occupy it, even if only for a little while, that\u2019s a gift.

      "bodyText": "Cineworld, the world\u2019s second biggest cinema chain, said admissions fell in the first half of the year, as the box-office hit Avengers: Endgame failed to make up for a weaker overall line-up of films. The company reported a fall of more than 14% in cinema-going in the first half, from 158.8m to 136m year-on-year. The drop in admissions meant the chain, which became the world\u2019s second largest by number of screens after its $3.6bn (\u00a32.95bn) takeover of the US movie theatre group Regal last year, also reported a significant fall in first-half revenues and profits. Revenues fell 11% to $2.1bn and pre-tax profits dropped almost 13% to $140m. The company said it expected the weaker performance because the three biggest films of 2018 \u2013 Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom \u2013 were all released in the first half making for a tough year-on-year comparison. Anthony Bloom, the chair of Cineworld, said: \u201cAs expected, revenue was softer on a comparative basis for the first half of the year due to the difference in timing of major releases.\u201d Despite the release of Avengers: Endgame, the biggest grossing film of all time, this year\u2019s first half slate, which included Captain Marvel and Aladdin, did not provide quite the same overall box-office pull. Attendance has been hampered by misfiring sequels including Men in Black: International, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. Cineworld is hoping that the release of the new Star Wars and Frozen films would boost admissions in the second half of the year, and said a stronger line up of films meant it was confident it would hit its financial forecasts for the full year. The Cineworld chief, Mooky Greidinger, said: \u201cSupported by a strong box office performance in July and a very encouraging second half release schedule, we maintain our outlook for the full year. \u201cVery strong admissions for The Lion King demonstrated the ongoing popularity of the theatrical business around the globe. Still to come are It: Chapter Two, Joker, Frozen 2, and one of the most anticipated movies in recent years, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Italy\u2019s transport minister has proposed a plan for diverting massive cruise ships from Venice\u2019s historic centre, with a view to rerouting a third of the vessels by next year. Danilo Toninelli told a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday that the ships could gradually be shifted away from the Marittima terminal and instead dock at Fusina, a small port on mainland Venice, or Lombardia, a privately owned terminal. The minister suggested that the rerouting process could begin in September. Toninelli has been under pressure to come up with a solution after four people were injured when the 13-deck MSC Opera crashed into a wharf and tourist boat along the busy Giudecca Canal, the main thoroughfare that leads to St Mark\u2019s Square, in early June. Weeks later the 12-deck Costa Deliziosa narrowly missed colliding with a yacht during a storm. The incidents have revived protests against big ships and calls from residents to ban them from the Venice lagoon altogether. Toninelli previously suggested diverting cruise liners to Chioggia, a port south of Venice. But a final decision would need to be made by a committee that includes the transport ministry and local and regional authorities. \u201cThese are Toninelli\u2019s hypotheses \u2026 no official solution has been decided,\u201d said a source at Venice council. Nicola Ussardi, a member of the No Big Ships activist group, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of chaos surrounding the issue in general.

Like a burgeoning hippy paradise, Bon Iver continues to attract ever more disciples: new album i,i features three dozen supporting players, mostly previous collaborators like Blake, the Dessners, the Staves, Francis Starlite, Poli\u00e7a, and Bruce Hornsby, plus a saxophone unit dubbed Sad Sax of Shit.</p> <p>But as anyone who saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/wild-wild-country-review-netflixs-take-on-the-cult-that-threatened-american-life\">Wild Wild Country</a> or read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/02/alex-garland-the-beach-20-years-on\">The Beach</a> will tell you, a burgeoning hippy paradise reaches a point where leadership gets blurred, people pull in different directions, and the dream sours. i,i is this point for the Bon Iver project, resulting in Vernon\u2019s first misfire.</p> <p>There is lots of prettiness and some innovative production, like the tumbles of wordless vocal on iMi, gently insulated by downy static; Vernon\u2019s gospel holler and falsetto curlicues will always make ears prick up. But frequently, including on iMi, his melodies are uninspired, feeling like the first thing he came up with while woodshedding around the backing track \u2013 on songs like Salem and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnDDghFYEGU\">Jelmore</a>, he squats in his comfort zone, letting his voice wander down well-worn pathways. The soulful little motif of Marion is OK, but feels like throat-clearing that on previous records would have led to a bigger pronouncement; here he reaches lazily for some half-hearted cooing and a listless \u201cwoo\u201d. Without strong songs, these soulful ad-libs veer on self-parody. Twice he sings of \u201ctokes\u201d and you rather suspect he\u2019s been toking all too hard: the lyrics feature a few lucid pleas for understanding (\u201cwhat I think we need / is elasticity\u201d) amid acid-addled sermonising. It is almost impossible to make a sax solo boring, but the witless Sh\u2019Diah manages it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f3a6522b44ab6984b586228d70d45dc11cd0738\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f3a6522b44ab6984b586228d70d45dc11cd0738/0_0_3601_3601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bon Iver: i,i album artwork\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bon Iver: i,i album artwork</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is admittedly a three-song stretch at the heart of the album that can compete with the rest of his catalogue. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDAKS18Gv1U\">Hey, Ma</a> is one of his best ever songs, its proper melody all the more tangible for coming after the mere simulacra before it; it has a subtle, powerful head-nod rhythm, and real bite to the scorn of its central lyric, \u201cfull time you talk your money up / while it\u2019s living in a coal mine.\u201d A withering judgment, perhaps of fossil-fuel lobbyists but probably just bullshitters everywhere, it has the simultaneous specificity and metaphor of the most resonant lyricism. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs5rXRPC0rc\">U (Man Like)</a> has Hornsby happily plonking at the piano like a rural schoolma\u2019am, and the song could be a secular hymn in the Bon Iver commune; the call and response on the stirring Naeem could be hollered out in the fields at harvest time. These songs have Vernon\u2019s most bracing quality: a sense that a fog has cleared and he\u2019s singing about what he can suddenly see. That fog closes in on the rest of the album, leaving Vernon baffled and lost.</p> <p>So many American cults and companies can\u2019t scale up, and collapse, their members becoming true individuals again. It would be a shame if this happened here, and Vernon went back to that cabin with an acoustic guitar: at his best, he points to a new way for songs to live and prosper. But if he is trying to build Bon Iver into a mini-utopia of shared values \u2013 the kind so many Americans strive towards, be it a startup, a gated suburb, a hippy commune or an ethno-state \u2013 he needs to be a stronger leader.</p>",

But as anyone who saw Wild Wild Country or read The Beach will tell you, a burgeoning hippy paradise reaches a point where leadership gets blurred, people pull in different directions, and the dream sours. i,i is this point for the Bon Iver project, resulting in Vernon\u2019s first misfire. There is lots of prettiness and some innovative production, like the tumbles of wordless vocal on iMi, gently insulated by downy static; Vernon\u2019s gospel holler and falsetto curlicues will always make ears prick up. But frequently, including on iMi, his melodies are uninspired, feeling like the first thing he came up with while woodshedding around the backing track \u2013 on songs like Salem and Jelmore, he squats in his comfort zone, letting his voice wander down well-worn pathways. The soulful little motif of Marion is OK, but feels like throat-clearing that on previous records would have led to a bigger pronouncement; here he reaches lazily for some half-hearted cooing and a listless \u201cwoo\u201d. Without strong songs, these soulful ad-libs veer on self-parody. Twice he sings of \u201ctokes\u201d and you rather suspect he\u2019s been toking all too hard: the lyrics feature a few lucid pleas for understanding (\u201cwhat I think we need / is elasticity\u201d) amid acid-addled sermonising. It is almost impossible to make a sax solo boring, but the witless Sh\u2019Diah manages it. There is admittedly a three-song stretch at the heart of the album that can compete with the rest of his catalogue. Hey, Ma is one of his best ever songs, its proper melody all the more tangible for coming after the mere simulacra before it; it has a subtle, powerful head-nod rhythm, and real bite to the scorn of its central lyric, \u201cfull time you talk your money up / while it\u2019s living in a coal mine.\u201d A withering judgment, perhaps of fossil-fuel lobbyists but probably just bullshitters everywhere, it has the simultaneous specificity and metaphor of the most resonant lyricism. U (Man Like) has Hornsby happily plonking at the piano like a rural schoolma\u2019am, and the song could be a secular hymn in the Bon Iver commune; the call and response on the stirring Naeem could be hollered out in the fields at harvest time. These songs have Vernon\u2019s most bracing quality: a sense that a fog has cleared and he\u2019s singing about what he can suddenly see. That fog closes in on the rest of the album, leaving Vernon baffled and lost. So many American cults and companies can\u2019t scale up, and collapse, their members becoming true individuals again. It would be a shame if this happened here, and Vernon went back to that cabin with an acoustic guitar: at his best, he points to a new way for songs to live and prosper. But if he is trying to build Bon Iver into a mini-utopia of shared values \u2013 the kind so many Americans strive towards, be it a startup, a gated suburb, a hippy commune or an ethno-state \u2013 he needs to be a stronger leader.",

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong casino magnate Lawrence Ho bought almost 10% of Crown Resorts from James Packer at the same time as he was a director of a company banned from involvement with Crown due to its links with Ho\u2019s father, Stanley, documents show. Company documents filed in Hong Kong show until 28 June this year Lawrence Ho was a director of Lanceford Company Limited. Lanceford was one of 59 companies and people described as associates of Stanley Ho who are banned from doing business with Crown under a previously secret condition of Crown\u2019s licence to build a new casino at Barangaroo in Sydney. On 30 May, Melco Resorts, where Lawrence Ho is chief executive and owns more than half the shares, agreed to buy almost 20% of Crown from Packer for about $1.75bn. Stock exchange filings show the first half of the shares were transferred on 6 June \u2013 the remainder are due to change hands by the end of September. The list of companies and people considered associates of Stanley Ho, who was banned in 2014 from having any role in Crown Resort\u2019s Barangaroo licence due to his alleged associations with organised crime, was tabled in NSW parliament on Thursday morning. Within hours of the tabling, the NSW Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority announced that former supreme court judge Patricia Bergin will chair an inquiry into the proposed Packer/Melco shares sale. The authority will also look at various matters raised in recent media reports published by the Nine Network, the Sydney Morning Herald and Melbourne\u2019s the Age relating to Crown Resorts. These include that the AFP had been investigating allegations of money laundering at Crown\u2019s Melbourne casino at the time the NSW regulator was conducting its probity review into Crown\u2019s suitability to operate a high-roller casino at Barangaroo in 2013-14. The publications also reported that millionaire Huang Xiangmo, who has been banned by Asio from entering Australia because of alleged Chinese influence operations, was a regular $800m a year gambler at Crown Melbourne. Separately, the Guardian revealed the Melbourne casino\u2019s regulator is not satisfied Crown has done enough to combat money laundering risks and make sure alleged criminals are kept off the property. In a statement released to the stock exchange on Thursday night Crown said it would \u201cfully cooperate in relation to this inquiry\u201d. The previously secret list of banned companies and persons associated with Stanley Ho does not include Lawrence, Stanley Ho\u2019s only son, or Melco, which was a business partner of Crown for a decade. However, the list does include three of Lawrence\u2019s sisters, who serve as directors in Stanley Ho\u2019s labyrinthine empire, and two of Stanley Ho\u2019s wives, including Angela Leong, who is a serving member of the assembly governing Chinese gambling enclave Macau. Stanley Ho and Pansy Ho were adversely named in by New Jersey regulators who were considering MGM Mirage\u2019s investment in the Borgata casino in Atlantic City in 2010. Ho let criminal gangs \u201coperate and thrive\u201d inside his casinos, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement said. The division found that Pansy Ho, his daughter, was dependent on him and his money and remains under his influence. The regulators concluded that Pansy Ho was an \u201cunsuitable\u201d business partner of MGM Mirage in the Chinese enclave of Macau and gave MGM Mirage the option of cutting ties to her or selling its 50% share in the New Jersey casino. It opted for the latter. The 2014 agreement between the NSW Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority and Packer\u2019s company Crown Resorts for Barangaroo reveals the deep concerns that the regulator had about any ties with Stanley Ho and the possible risk of infiltration by organised crime into the proposed high-roller casino in Sydney. The agreement contains a section entitled \u201cPrevention of associations with Stanley Ho\u201d. It says Crown will \u201censure that it prevents any new business activities or transactions of a material nature between Stanley Huang Sun Ho or a Stanley Ho associate and Crown, any of Crown\u2019s officers, directors or employees or any Crown subsidiary\u201d. The list of banned entities was released this morning after independent upper house MP Justin Field asked for the list to be tabled in parliament. Field said the release of the list was important because \u201cit sheds light on conditions that may relate to the recent purchase by Stanley Ho\u2019s son, Mr Lawrence Ho\u2019s Melco Resorts and Entertainment, of a 19.9% stake in Crown Resorts\u201d. \u201cGiven the recent revelations relating to Crown\u2019s operations in Australia and overseas including the associations with junket operators linked with organised crime and, in particular, money laundering, more scrutiny is needed on the operations of Crown,\u201d he said. The Hong Kong company documents show the three banned sisters - Pansy Ho, Daisy Ho and Maisy Ho \u2013 are also directors of Lanceford and reveal its shareholders are two British Virgin Islands companies that are also on the banned list, Action Winner Holdings and Ranillo Investments. The list also includes two companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange that are dominated by the Ho family, SJM Holdings, which runs casinos in Macau, and Shun Tak Holdings, a conglomerate with interests spanning property development, hotels and ferries. Shun Tak and Melco do business together to transport gamblers from Hong Kong to Melco\u2019s casinos in Macau, the only territory in China where casino gambling is legal. Shun Tak\u2019s most recent annual report shows that, since October 2016, it has had a deal to sell tickets to its ferry between Hong Kong and Macau to Melco. Last year, Melco bought HK$31.8m (about $6m) of tickets from Shun Tak under the arrangement, which expires in three years. Not included on the list of Stanley Ho associates tabled in parliament were 37 companies Shun Tak listed in its annual report as subsidiaries and another six listed as SJM subsidiaries in that company\u2019s report. The documents tabled in parliament at Field\u2019s request also reveal that Crown bitterly resisted having the list released in its submissions to arbiter Anthony Mason. Mason, the former chief justice of the high court, was scathing of Crowns\u2019s attempts to keep the list secret, concluding that \u201cthe subject matter is obviously a matter of potential and legitimate interest to the House\u201d. Crown tried first to oppose the release and then to restrict access of its concerns to the arbiter only. But these have been released too. Crown argued \u201cthere is a genuine risk that Crown Resorts competitors and those who oppose Crown\u2019s business would be able to misuse the information in order to gain an unfair commercial advantage or disrupt Crown\u2019s business.\u201d Crown, Melco and the NSW gaming minister, Victor Dominello, have been approached for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Essediya Magboul leads a group across the open-air market of Porta Palazzo in Turin on a windy Saturday morning. Stopping at a stall, she picks up a bottle of laban, and gives a detailed account of the meticulous mixing needed to prepare the Middle Eastern yoghurt drink. \u201cIt\u2019s a Ramadan must,\u201d she adds, smiling, before continuing to an Arab-owned bakery where the owners offer samples of ghoriba cookies and answer questions. In the space of a few streets, she takes her guests from Eastern Europe to East Asia, via the Middle East. The walkers could easily be mistaken for tourists, but they are in fact locals. Magboul is a Migrantour guide, and the concept is to show Italians the wealth of contributions made to their home cities by migrants. \u201cI hope my storytelling can help Italians see us Muslims in a different light,\u201d adds Magboul, who moved from Morocco to Italy in 2002 and says she has often experienced prejudice because she wears a hijab. The Migrantour concept started in Turin in 2010 and has since spread to nine other Italian cities, including Bologna, Naples and Florence. The tours cost an average of \u20ac12 and more than 150 guides are employed on a freelance basis. \u201cOur walks aim at giving value to the impact that foreign communities have had on our neighbourhoods for centuries,\u201d explains Rosina Chiurazzi, coordinator of Migrantour Turin and a guide herself. \u201cNow more than ever, there\u2019s a need in this country for initiatives that portray migrants as locals too, instead of pointing out their diversity.\u201d On another Turin Migrantour, guide Monica Ilies tells her group how she moved to Italy straight after high school and reunited with her mother after six years apart. \u201cWhen the Ceausescu regime fell, Romanians were finally free to leave the country and escape poverty,\u201d she explains as they tour a Romanian butcher\u2019s shop. \u201cMany, like my mother, landed a job in Italy as domestic workers. Having to grow up without a mother was my hardest challenge as a teenager.\u201d The 36-year-old says she is upset by stereotypes that portray Romanians as thieves, sex workers or domestic helpers. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t see is that migrant mothers make huge sacrifices to provide a better future for their children,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt seems absurd having to highlight it, but yes, we are human beings too.\u201d One participant, Roberta Comba, is clearly moved by the story. A teacher at a vocational school, she says she joined Migrantours to learn more about the lives of foreign students in her class. \u201cI wanted a chance to feel closer to them,\u201d she says. \u201cThese encounters help us understand the struggle of having no choice but to leave your family and country for a bigger purpose, a pain we lucky ones often don\u2019t know.\u201d Chiurazzi says work is under way to make their tours part of the school curriculum. \u201cCurrent participants are often people who already have positive attitudes towards migration and simply want to learn more,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we thought about involving schools through daytime walks, to help educate younger generations. Students often come to us thinking migrants make up 70% of the Italian population today because they\u2019re bombarded with headlines that make them perceive migration as an alien invasion. With accurate data and face-to-face encounters it is easier to fight fake news and unnecessary hate.\u201d At the opposite end of the country, Abubakar Dukuly leads a small but lively group of locals around Catania in eastern Sicily, where migrants make up 4% of the population. The attendants are openly curious as Dukuly takes them through San Berillo, a historic quarter of the city that has recently become home to a large Muslim community. It is an area that most residents overlook. He explains how he was born in a refugee camp in Guinea on the west coast of Africa, his family having left neighbouring Liberia when civil war broke out. Later he took the dangerous desert route through Libya before a dinghy brought him across the sea to Sicily in 2017. Dukuly recently turned 18 and so lost the humanitarian protection normally granted to unaccompanied minors. He is worried about his future but maintains his warm smile. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to use the \u2018us v them\u2019 narrative today,\u201d participant Stefania Di Pietro says at the end of the tour. \u201cBut during the walk Abubakar found a kind of tree that also grows in Sub-Saharan Africa, and joked about how the bad traffic reminded him of home. Noticing geographical and urban similarities between Sicily and Africa helps us challenge that narrative.\u201d Flavia Monfrini, the coordinator of Migrantour Catania, says most Sicilian participants tend to be young but she hopes to engage older generations too. \u201cThe current government is trying to brainwash us and make us think there\u2019s an emergency we have to protect ourselves from,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut the truth is that human mobility is, and will always be, part of our social fabric. Migration has always been the normality, especially here in Sicily.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "bodyText": "Despite her global acclaim, Billie Trix \u2013 a fictional pop icon in the tradition of the Rutles and Spinal Tap \u2013 might have been forgotten, had she not been championed by actor Frances Barber and rehabilitated by Pet Shop Boys. Six Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe songs grace this one-woman celebration, including Friendly Fire, a piano ballad from their 2001 musical Closer to Heaven, which first introduced Trix to the world. The other songs, four of them new, range from Latin shuffle and 60s pop to full-on disco, and are as catchy and insistent as you\u2019d expect. The show suggests you can tell a lot about a person by when they discovered Billie Trix. There are the early adopters: those folk-loving peaceniks who picked up on her first single, Cover Me in Calamine, just as she was hitting New York from a rubble-strewn Berlin with an unknown Nico for company. Soon she would give soup-tin inspiration to Andy Warhol. The cinema lovers will tell you they became fans as soon as they saw The Masturbation of Race, which drew in a further legion of high-art admirers when it was adapted as an oratorio. If you\u2019re a theatregoer, it was probably her \u201cincomprehensible\u201d Mother Courage that got you hooked. Trix has a Zelig-like gift for being in the right place at the right time. As she says herself, she\u2019s a \u201czeitgeist for sore eyes\u201d and, just as she captured the disco market with the Sister Sledge-like pulse of Ich Bin Music, so she caught the eye of the YBA scene when she hung out with Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin in the 90s. She has been courted by everyone from Dal\u00ed to Trump, and no less a figure than Jean-Paul Sartre called her pretentious. Scripted by Jonathan Harvey, the performance shows how qualities that in others would come across as arrogance, conceit and Germanic froideur, in Trix seem entirely justified. Time and again, she has proved the naysayers wrong and has had the power not only to reinvent herself, but to bring peace where there is conflict. We laugh \u2013 a lot \u2013 in support of her resilience. In any case, who could remain sceptical when the star sings such evergreen hits as Little Can of Soup (for Warhol) and Run Girl Run (for Vietnam) with all the smoky grit of a survivor? \u2022 At Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh, until 24 August. Then at Leicester Square theatre, London, 3\u20137 September. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews",

I wake up around 6am for work and come back around 8pm and then I find [Elizabeth] in the neighbour\u2019s house. She misses her mother, obviously, but also her brothers and sisters. But God willing I can keep affording the school fees for this one; sometimes it\u2019s difficult.\u201d The day after this photo was taken he relinquished responsibility for his daughter, accepting that his drinking made him unable to look after her. Her teachers found Elizabeth a place in a small residential school for girls run by a local woman. Cody Achieng wanted to be a singer, and a few years ago spent all her savings on making a music video that she cannot afford to show anyone because she has no data credit on her phone. She has a strong, soulful voice but for now she runs a stall, with piles of mixed secondhand socks on a tarpaulin. At 13, she was forcibly married off to an abusive man by her father. Now she is 29 and has four children. None of the fathers have anything to do with the family, and it is noticeable that her neighbours don\u2019t treat her with the customary friendliness or warmth. Achieng\u2019s husband abandoned her after she was badly burned by a cooking stove accident. Destitute, she was taken in by a man who raped her and pimped her. \u201cI try to do the best for the children, my eldest son goes to school,\u201d she says with pride, \u201cbut it is hard to find the rent [\u00a330] every month.\u201d Several years ago, Achieng met a foreign charity worker visiting Kibera who promised she would write to her and help her with her ambitions. She still hopes that woman might return. Jacqueline and James Onyango with their first baby Wesley at their home in Kibera. Jacqueline was badly burned down her arm and leg when the stove collapsed on her a few months ago. Sitting happily gossiping and laughing between two elderly friends, Mary Nasia is a widow with no children or relatives. \u201cI have been here for 10 years, since my husband died and I had no way to support myself in our old home. \u201cBut I have friends here and I sell my beans every day and I have no one to please but myself. I am 63 and Kibera is my family. I am very happy here. Each day comes as a blessing to me and people like my beans.\u201d Fred Openo, his wife Beatrice Ouma and their children pose for a photograph outside their home. The couple work together, buying ground nuts from market traders in Nairobi early in the morning and bringing them back into Kibera to sell in small packets or plastic bottles. With this money they are trying to save up so they can afford to send their children to school when they are older. Celestine, 19, holds her son Raven at a health clinic in Kibera. She is a single mother living temporarily with an aunt in Kibera, but she says \u201cit\u2019s difficult\u201d because she doesn\u2019t bring in any money and there are two mouths to feed. Her own mother threw her out of the family home when she fell pregnant. Teenage pregnancy is still a stigma in Kibera for unmarried young women. It is very hard for girls and women to access family planning services, both in terms of availability and because of the taboo around sex outside marriage. Roseline Amondi is known in her area of Kibera as \u201cMama Fish\u201d for the fresh tilapia and Nile perch she sells. She owns one of the very few fridges in the slum and is always being asked to store things for neighbours. She is also a port of call for lost children. \u201cMany children in Kibera get lost, they wander away and can\u2019t find their way home. There\u2019s so many people that do not know each other that it is very easy for a child to be lost and be unsafe. People will bring children to me because they know the child will be safe here. Sometimes I have many!\u201d she laughs. Of her eight children, four are birth children and four are orphans that she is raising as her own. Amondi has a reputation for wisdom and is often called on to be both marriage and family guidance counsellor in her community. \u201cI got married at 18, when I was still a child. It was not a good idea and he was not a good man. It takes a long time to have the courage to leave a bad situation when you are such a young girl. Many girls rush in to marriage at 13, 17 \u2013 it\u2019s too young. I tell the young people, go to school, wait. My daughter was a teenage mum but I did not throw her out, I would not do that to my child, they should be allowed to make mistakes. I try to tell other mothers and fathers in Kibera, value your child. Love that child.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In normal American mass murders \u2013 because such horrors have become so astonishingly normal \u2013 the president usually plays the role of some great but helpless comfort blanket. He may be unable to break the NRA\u2019s cold, dead grip on the Republican party, but he can at least hug the victims to make it look like he cares. But with this most abnormal of presidents, the whole kabuki has come to an unnatural end. Donald Trump is uniquely placed to do something about these massacres \u2013 with or without anyone\u2019s help \u2013 yet he is also uniquely unable to look like he cares. So he visited the victims of the massacre in hospitals in El Paso and Dayton \u2013 not Toledo, as he told the nation on Monday \u2013 but he bizarrely remained out of sight. Perhaps it was just as well. Trump is not great at comforting the afflicted, having built his political career on afflicting the afflicted. He\u2019s also not too good at empathy or emoting. You could forgive his handlers for wanting to script his every word and keep him otherwise off camera. However, his handlers seem cack-handed, too. Stephanie Grisham, the new White House press secretary and communications director \u2013 who has yet to give a briefing or communicate in public \u2013 tweeted a choice quote from Trump at the Dayton hospital. \u201cYou had God watching. I want you to know we\u2019re with you all the way,\u201d she quoted Trump saying. This is a confusing couple of lines that speak volumes about Trump\u2019s worldview. Even as he reaches for some divine comfort, he inserts himself into the picture. Both God and Trump are watching the victims, but only one of them will do so on Fox News. Donald Trump is not, in fact, helpless in the face of so much of the violence ripping apart this nation. He does not actually need legislation or the NRA\u2019s blessing to have an impact. All he needs to do is renounce the white nationalism that he has placed at the heart of his immigration policies \u2013 his biggest domestic priority \u2013 and that ooze through his poisonous public comments. All he needs to do is denounce the neo-Nazi supporters that he can\u2019t bring himself to condemn. All he needs to do is to start acting less like the spiritual leader of a terrorist movement and more like the president of the United States. This is hard for Trump, obviously. On Monday he read his teleprompter statement like the hostage statement it was scripted to be. \u201cIn one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy,\u201d said the man who came to power lamenting all the immigrants coming from what he calls \u201cshithole\u201d countries. \u201cThese sinister ideologies must be defeated.\u201d That was so Monday. Just two days later, as he prepared to travel to Dayton and El Paso, Trump had given up on all that \u201cone voice\u201d stuff to concentrate on condemning the real enemy \u2013 Democrats who criticize him \u2013 instead of racism, bigotry and whatever else his staffers made him say. \u201cBeto (phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage) O\u2019Rourke, who is embarrassed by my last visit to the Great State of Texas, where I trounced him, and is now even more embarrassed by polling at 1% in the Democrat Primary,\u201d Trump tweeted around midnight, \u201cshould respect the victims &amp; law enforcement \u2013 &amp; be quiet!\u201d Memo from the president to a grieving nation: enough about the victims and the epidemic of gun deaths. How about some more attention on me? So he began his solemn day of visiting the victims by attacking the New York Times for changing its ludicrously gullible headline about his Monday statement. \u201cFake News \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re up against\u2026\u201d he tweeted.

This was the week one of his biggest fans was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing more than a dozen bombs to Trump\u2019s list of enemies. Cesar Sayoc was obsessed with Trump, according to his lawyer, buying Trump-branded clothes and looking up to him \u201cas a father figure\u201d. So what\u2019s it to be, Mr President?

In a lecture-style monologue, working-class artist Scottee adopts an abrasive tone as he schools his predominantly middle-class audience, demanding we scrutinise our attitudes towards the postcode lottery of class. At the door, he uses Waitrose tokens to ask us what the working class need more: love or money. \u201cSixty per cent of you said money.\u201d He sticks out his hand. \u201cGo on, hand it over.\u201d Unlike a lot of shows that involve personal, sometimes distressing testimony, Class doesn\u2019t allow us to pat ourselves on the back for having engaged with a difficult topic. Instead, it berates us and sends us home with our tails between our legs. There is a sense in which we can\u2019t win in answer to any of his questions; all our responses will be met with scorn.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 25 years since Tracy Nicholls decided to take a part-time job working for the patient transport service (PTS) in the East of England. At home with young children, she knew she wanted to do a job that involved helping people, and when she saw an advertisement for a role that involved driving people to and from the hospital, she thought it sounded right up her street. As soon as she started the job, she realised: \u201cThis is me. I\u2019m done for life now. They\u2019ve got their hooks into me and I don\u2019t want to let go.\u201d</p> <p>The East of England ambulance service NHS trust (EEAST) covers a vast geographical area that takes in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Its non-stop service operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and each day it handles 3,600 emergency calls in its emergency operations centres at Bedford, Chelmsford and Norwich. As well as responding to emergency calls, it provides non-emergency patient transport services (where Nicholls began her career) to and from treatment centres. It also operates two hazardous area response teams and a resilience and emergency planning department that works with critical care charities and community volunteers to respond to emergency situations. Finally, it operates income-generating commercial services, such as first aid training.</p> <p>These days, Nicholls still works for EEAST, but as director of clinical quality and improvement. The career path that led her to that role is a testament to the opportunities available in the organisation. Her part-time driving job led her to full-time work on the high dependency unit, which involved going out on ambulance calls with a paramedic. After nine months, she trained as an emergency medical technician, which progressed naturally towards training, a year later, as a paramedic.</p> <p>Nicholls has enjoyed all the jobs she\u2019s done for the service. \u201cWhat I loved was the variety,\u201d she says of her first role. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know if you were indoors or outdoors. You could have the same patients every week for six weeks and everything would be different every time you picked them up. It felt so rewarding.\u201d Simple things such as picking the rugs off a patient\u2019s floor, so they didn\u2019t fall over, or driving them to their chemotherapy or dialysis appointment on time \u201cgives you a real sense of satisfaction\u201d, she says.</p> <p>When she took the paramedic job, Nicholls thought it would be the \u201cpinnacle\u201d of her career. She worked in a busy station in Luton, becoming a station manager, so that as well as going out on ambulances, she was managing staff and dealing with operational problems such as fleet breakdowns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16534a8fa6c27a564d1e87e6970844de4f0329f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16534a8fa6c27a564d1e87e6970844de4f0329f2/153_645_8032_4819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"East of England Ambulance service.

Nicholls admires the fact that EEAST were \u201cbrave\u201d enough to offer the role to a paramedic, and uses her position to represent the staff, asking: \u201cWhat would this decision mean to me if I\u2019m sitting on a station?

Once in the service, as Nicholls\u2019 experience shows, there are plenty of opportunities to undergo professional training and progress to higher roles.</p> <p>Because the service covers such a diverse area, there is no shortage of variety. As Nicholls explains: \u201cWe\u2019ve got Essex, which borders London, we\u2019ve got rural communities such as Norfolk. We have airports, heavy industry and agriculture. We also have a transient population because of tourism \u2013 in the summer, the whole population of Norfolk and the Essex coastline swells and demand goes up.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholls firmly believes that working for EEAST is the \u201cbest job in the world\u201d. She adds: \u201cYou are invited into people\u2019s homes and places of work in their darkest hour, and when you walk in people relax, and that\u2019s when we go up a gear and say: \u2018OK, we\u2019re here to help.\u2019 The extensive training really just kicks in and you\u2019re able to deal with very different things, from road traffic accidents to a heart attack, and from a baby being born to a diabetic coma.

Nicholls remembers attending a severe road traffic collision in which a man was injured so badly the only thing he could say was his wife\u2019s mobile phone number. She recalls how many people were at the scene: \u201cYou saw your fire service colleagues were right by your side helping you, your police colleagues were right there, sorting everything out, the air ambulance came and gave extended skills we couldn\u2019t give.\u201d When the man recovered and was discharged from hospital, he couldn\u2019t remember a thing. \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d says Nicholls. \u201cThat\u2019s a first-class result where everybody comes together because one life is worth it. One life is always worth it.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>With a smile and a bin liner, Marie Kondo is about to descend on your fridge. An Instagram story from her lifestyle brand <a href=\"https://konmari.com/\" title=\"\">KonMari.com</a> yesterday ruled that you should always keep your fridge 30% empty \u2013 or 70% full, if that means more to you \u2013 for shopping and leftovers. The appliance they illustrated the rule with was so comically clean and colour-coordinated, you wonder who can live \u2013 and shop and cook and clean \u2013 like that. </p> <p>But from a purely technical perspective, uncluttering your fridge has undeniable benefits: it ensures the air can circulate freely, meaning the temperature stays steady and the appliance lasts longer. And it allows you to stay on top of your provisions: you\u2019re more likely to use them up in a timely manner and not buy more of what you\u2019ve already got. Lastly, and a big part of Kondo\u2019s enduring appeal, is a clean, tidy, pretty fridge is absurdly calming. I have long hung washing and stacked bookshelves by colour for that reason \u2013 why not chilled produce, too?</p> <p>So, to break the dream down into more manageable parts, here is a guide to fridge hygiene.</p> <h2><strong>1) What is the optimal temperature?</strong></h2> <p>Between 1C and 4C: you want your food to be kept at 5C or lower. Go for colder when your fridge is full or you\u2019ve just packed it with a big shop on a hot day; to save on energy, a little warmer when it is cold and your fridge is looking a little bare. (NB: Defrost your freezer when ice is more than 5mm thick \u2013 about once a year \u2013 but don\u2019t allow any in your fridge as it prevents air circulation and messes with the appliance\u2019s inner thermostat.)</p> <h2><strong>2) How often should you clean it, and </strong><strong>with what?</strong></h2> <p>Clear up spillages immediately. Wipe down the handles daily and, once a week, the door outside. Check shelves and containers for anything lacklustre or out of date \u2013 and bin. Once every three months, empty the whole thing, take out all removable parts (shelves, drawers, racks) and wash with hot water and a little washing-up liquid (never bleach or any non-foodsafe chemical cleaners).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8ab4adca4e633754fa954d6e0127005869c7c494\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ab4adca4e633754fa954d6e0127005869c7c494/47_0_4135_5169/800.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t keep open tins of food in the fridge \u2013 decant the contents.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t keep open tins of food in the fridge \u2013 decant the contents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3) And if you need to deep clean?</strong></h2> <p>Use a toothbrush and a thick paste of bicarb mixed with water to get rid of stubborn stains. At this stage <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/how-often-to-clean-appliances-1908622\" title=\"\">the Spruce recommends</a> unplugging your empty, clean fridge and hoovering \u2013 hoovering! \u2013 underneath and behind it, as well as removing any vented covers to reach dust-coated fans and coils. The reason (the dust makes the fridge work harder) might be sound, but that remains a level of domestic proficiency with which I am decidedly unfamiliar.</p> <h2><strong>4) What </strong><strong>should not be in there?</strong></h2> <p>Most fruit (including tomatoes and cucumbers) should be kept at room temperature and out of the sun \u2013 especially any that need to ripen; farm eggs you\u2019ve bought at room temperature; and a lot of veg (potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, winter squashes, beets, and other roots, including ginger).</p> <p>Don\u2019t store opened tin cans \u2013 once open to the air, <a href=\"https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/storing-food-safely\" title=\"\">the tin from the can can transfer more quickly to the can\u2019s contents</a>. Only cans that come with resealable lids are fine to keep in the fridge.

      "bodyText": "With a smile and a bin liner, Marie Kondo is about to descend on your fridge. An Instagram story from her lifestyle brand KonMari.com yesterday ruled that you should always keep your fridge 30% empty \u2013 or 70% full, if that means more to you \u2013 for shopping and leftovers. The appliance they illustrated the rule with was so comically clean and colour-coordinated, you wonder who can live \u2013 and shop and cook and clean \u2013 like that. But from a purely technical perspective, uncluttering your fridge has undeniable benefits: it ensures the air can circulate freely, meaning the temperature stays steady and the appliance lasts longer. And it allows you to stay on top of your provisions: you\u2019re more likely to use them up in a timely manner and not buy more of what you\u2019ve already got. Lastly, and a big part of Kondo\u2019s enduring appeal, is a clean, tidy, pretty fridge is absurdly calming. I have long hung washing and stacked bookshelves by colour for that reason \u2013 why not chilled produce, too? So, to break the dream down into more manageable parts, here is a guide to fridge hygiene. 1) What is the optimal temperature? Between 1C and 4C: you want your food to be kept at 5C or lower. Go for colder when your fridge is full or you\u2019ve just packed it with a big shop on a hot day; to save on energy, a little warmer when it is cold and your fridge is looking a little bare. (NB: Defrost your freezer when ice is more than 5mm thick \u2013 about once a year \u2013 but don\u2019t allow any in your fridge as it prevents air circulation and messes with the appliance\u2019s inner thermostat.) 2) How often should you clean it, and with what? Clear up spillages immediately. Wipe down the handles daily and, once a week, the door outside. Check shelves and containers for anything lacklustre or out of date \u2013 and bin. Once every three months, empty the whole thing, take out all removable parts (shelves, drawers, racks) and wash with hot water and a little washing-up liquid (never bleach or any non-foodsafe chemical cleaners). 3) And if you need to deep clean? Use a toothbrush and a thick paste of bicarb mixed with water to get rid of stubborn stains. At this stage the Spruce recommends unplugging your empty, clean fridge and hoovering \u2013 hoovering! \u2013 underneath and behind it, as well as removing any vented covers to reach dust-coated fans and coils. The reason (the dust makes the fridge work harder) might be sound, but that remains a level of domestic proficiency with which I am decidedly unfamiliar. 4) What should not be in there? Most fruit (including tomatoes and cucumbers) should be kept at room temperature and out of the sun \u2013 especially any that need to ripen; farm eggs you\u2019ve bought at room temperature; and a lot of veg (potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, winter squashes, beets, and other roots, including ginger). Don\u2019t store opened tin cans \u2013 once open to the air, the tin from the can can transfer more quickly to the can\u2019s contents. Only cans that come with resealable lids are fine to keep in the fridge. Decant leftovers (see below). Don\u2019t refrigerate hot food: wait for it to cool completely, to avoid contamination and messing up your fridge temperature. Products past their \u201cuse-by\u201d date or not finished within the \u201conce opened\u201d timeframe belong in the bin. Finally, bread: Serious Eats once published a 1,164-word article detailing why refrigeration ruins bread; read it, or if life\u2019s too short, just trust me. 5) And what should? Ripened fruit, citrus, all berries, milk, yoghurt, meat, fish, any opened product that specifies refrigerating once opened. Eggs need consistent temperatures, so if you\u2019ve bought them refrigerated, keep them that way. All veg apart from those above. Leftovers (as soon as they have cooled), and any fresh, ready-to-eat, deli-style products. Large tubs of nut butters that you won\u2019t use up quickly \u2013 the cold should keep them from separating. Open pickles and jams can be kept in a cool dark cupboard, as can mustard, syrup, but read the instructions on the jar. Opened wine \u2013 even red \u2013 should go in the fridge. 6) What goes where? Top shelf: anything that doesn\u2019t need cooking (sliced meats, dips, leftovers, deli dishes, tortilla wraps etc), as well as the contents of any unfinished tin can, decanted into a clean, lidded container. Middle shelf: all dairy and eggs \u2013 despite the milk bottle-specific door racks, and door egg-holders, doors are not the right place for either. Bottom shelf: meat and fish. Veg drawers: fruit, veg, leaves, herbs. Lettuce and other greens (washed, thoroughly dried, wrapped in paper towel) go in a spinner, their own container or a veg drawer all to themselves. Store all soft fresh herbs (except basil) like a bouquet, washed and in a glass jar with a little water, well away from the icy back of the fridge. Door racks: juices, condiments, spreads etc \u2013 things with the longest shelf-life. 7) Store together or always separate? The rule of thumb is to store like with like: meat with meat and fish with fish; veg and fruit in separate veg drawers (mixing the two often results in the ethylene the fruit produces spoiling the veg); herbs and green leaves away from the icy-cold back of the fridge (to which they\u2019ll inevitably stick, thereby making a mess of both your fridge and your salad plans.) 8) Tips for shelf organisation Adjust your shelves, and stack wisely: use flat long containers (juice carton-length) to make use of the full depth of your fridge; use lidded containers that can stack in order of height; put tall things behind short ones (so nothing is hidden); and position duplicates (bottles of beer, say) one directly behind the other. Glass is best for visibility, hygiene and sustainability: get containers with lids that shut tight. Label anything opened or decanted with the date of purchase: washi tape is undeniably good-looking, but any plain tape you can write on works too. 9) Tips for dealing with odours A well-sealed glass container is best. Also, keep an open box of bicarb on the bottom shelf \u2013 or sprinkle some at the bottom of your veg drawer and cover it with paper towel. (Of course, when you replace the bicarb every three months, don\u2019t bake with it.

On Thursday, he unleashed. \u201cWhat is it about sections of the Australian media who fail to appreciate our great game,\u201d he posted on Facebook. \u201cUntil yesterday, I\u2019d never heard of a media outlet \u2018Junkee\u2019. But yesterday, this utterly humourless mob decided to attack our great game of handball \u2013 as well as my own enthusiastic promotion of the sport. They said it was all just bizarre.\u201d It\u2019s a case of crossed wires. Junkee say they came from a place of fondness, and further down, the article does say he is \u201cindisputably the handball king\u201d. And of course, there\u2019s an air of satire in Rudd\u2019s post, especially the sign-off \u201cHandball Solidarity Forever\u201d, and in his initial video where he clearly says that he is not actually a champ, but a \u201ctry-hard\u201d. Nevertheless, Rudd has urged hundreds of thousands of people to flood Junkee\u2019s Facebook page to punish them. Did they? As of publication, there were two. So who is right and who is wrong? Who is in Dunce and who is in Kings? Junkee have responded quickly, and have now challenged him to settle it in the only court that matters. \u201cAs lifelong fans of handball, our editorial team cannot let this dog shot slide,\u201d they said. \u201cYou mentioned that you\u2019re now available for a handball championship game. We\u2019d like to take you up on that offer.\u201d For those keen for a signed ball, there are also reports that people have to pay for their own envelopes. Wait, what\u2019s handball? OK, if you\u2019re from Victoria it\u2019s called downball, and in WA it\u2019s called foursquare. Whatever.",

On Sunday, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had threatened to invade within the next fortnight, creating a conundrum for Washington, which views both the Turks and the Kurds as allies and has increasingly struggled to keep them from conflict.</p> <p>Though light on detail, the agreement suggests that a safe zone inside the Kurdish north-east would be jointly run by Turkish and US forces. No specifics were offered on the route that such a corridor might take or how deep it would extend into Syria. The lack of clarity led some observers to claim the US was buying time and was not committed to a plan that could seriously test its already faltering ties with the region\u2019s Kurds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/syria-new-idlib-clashes-sow-total-panic-among-civilians-un-says\">Syria: new Idlib clashes sow 'total panic' among civilians, UN says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically an agreement to continue talking,\u201d said a former US official. \u201cThat\u2019s a net good. But with Trump having no commitment to Syria, and our forces now cut to the bone, there is little we can really do to support a safe zone. So it\u2019s a lot of wishful thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Turkey suggested it would use the newly established zone to return Syrian refugees inside its borders whom officials have started rounding up and returning to Syria in recent weeks. Senior Kurdish officials said such moves would amount to demographically reshaping a border that is dominated by Kurds and which Ankara wants to transform into an Arab stronghold.</p> <p>\u201cWe are aware of the Turkish government\u2019s intention, which is to change the demography of Syria just as the Ba\u2019ath regime did in the 60s by building the Arab belt,\u201d said Jihad Omar, the co-chair of the Office of Diplomatic Relations in the Syrian Democratic Council. \u201cIt is something we stand against because it is a genocide against the Kurds.</p> <p>\u201cTurkey is trying to repeat the same scenario of Afrin [a north-western Syrian town that was a Kurdish stronghold until a Turkish incursion in January last year]. The Turkish government\u2019s Kurdophobia is in the core of its policies.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement also failed to shed light on any implications for two large detention camps and two prisons which hold more than 130,000 suspected Isis members or supporters \u2013 the remnants of the collapsed so-called \u201ccaliphate\u201d which regarded north-east Syria as a centre of gravity until its battlefield defeat this year.</p> <p>The fate of the facilities had been of deep concern to regional and western states during the Turkish buildup, and senior diplomatic sources suggested the bilateral deal may have been struck to temper such fears.</p> <p>Though Isis no longer controls territory, there are strong and growing concerns that the organisation is using the camps to regroup and regenerate. Senior western officials had worried that Isis members could attempt an organised breakout, if Kurdish forces guarding them had been distracted by a war with the Turks.</p> <p>For much of the Syrian war, Turkey had been a full-throated supporter of the anti-Assad opposition, arming some insurgent groups and offering shelter to up to 4 million Syrians who had fled the fighting. However, over the past 18 months, its interests have narrowed and it now aims to shape the dying phase of the eight-year conflict along nationalist lines.</p> <p>Ankara\u2019s first priority is to try to ensure that Kurdish groups, which are allied to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), with which it continues to fight a four-decade-long insurgency inside its borders, do not emerge emboldened.</p> <p>Turkey insists Kurdish leaders with whom the US allied to fight Isis, under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), are ideologically and militarily allied to the PKK.</p> <p>\u201cThe fundamental issue is that the US supports the SDF, a group that Turkey views as a terrorist organisation,\u201d said Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East programme at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \u201cThe statement does not reconcile this fundamental issue, nor does it address a core divergence over how deep any zone would be. These remain to be resolved and, quite frankly, I don\u2019t see how to do that.\u201d</p> <p>A second issue for Ankara is Syrian refugees, whose fate has become a lightning rod for leaders on both sides of a divided political spectrum. \u201cThe refugee issue is fast nearing a tip-over in Turkey,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish programme at the Washington Institute. He said the impact of refugees on Turkish society could not be overestimated, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s the most significant demographic shift since the Greek/Turkish exchange of the 1920s.</p> <p>\u201cSouthern Turkey has become 10 to 15% Syrian, and with the economy slowing down resentment towards refugees is rising.</p> <p>\u201cErdo\u011fan is therefore very eager to have this issue go away. He\u2019s pressing hard for the safe zone, not just to undermine the YPG and the establishment of a PKK-allied state there but also to relocate a large number of refugees back to Syria. The statement out of the US embassy is significant: it shows that both sides have consensus on that.\u201d</p> <p>Stein suggested \u201cpotential violations of international law could hinder implementation\u201d of any forced refugee returns. The Syrian Democratic Council\u2019s Omar said any influx of Arab Syrians would not be tolerated.</p> <p>\u201cOur position has been very clear from the first day: any advance of Turkish forces and its allied armed groups into Syria is unacceptable. The recent agreement between the US and Turkey to build a new safe zone won\u2019t change our position.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting: Mohammed Rasool</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The announcement by Turkey and the US that they will set up a safe zone in Kurdish-run north-eastern Syria allays fears of an imminent Turkish incursion into the country, but will strain Washington\u2019s ties with a force that helped defeat Islamic State. The announcement came as Ankara was finalising a troop buildup along its southern border, which it shares with Syrian Kurds. On Sunday, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had threatened to invade within the next fortnight, creating a conundrum for Washington, which views both the Turks and the Kurds as allies and has increasingly struggled to keep them from conflict. Though light on detail, the agreement suggests that a safe zone inside the Kurdish north-east would be jointly run by Turkish and US forces. No specifics were offered on the route that such a corridor might take or how deep it would extend into Syria. The lack of clarity led some observers to claim the US was buying time and was not committed to a plan that could seriously test its already faltering ties with the region\u2019s Kurds. \u201cIt\u2019s basically an agreement to continue talking,\u201d said a former US official. \u201cThat\u2019s a net good. But with Trump having no commitment to Syria, and our forces now cut to the bone, there is little we can really do to support a safe zone. So it\u2019s a lot of wishful thinking.\u201d Turkey suggested it would use the newly established zone to return Syrian refugees inside its borders whom officials have started rounding up and returning to Syria in recent weeks. Senior Kurdish officials said such moves would amount to demographically reshaping a border that is dominated by Kurds and which Ankara wants to transform into an Arab stronghold. \u201cWe are aware of the Turkish government\u2019s intention, which is to change the demography of Syria just as the Ba\u2019ath regime did in the 60s by building the Arab belt,\u201d said Jihad Omar, the co-chair of the Office of Diplomatic Relations in the Syrian Democratic Council. \u201cIt is something we stand against because it is a genocide against the Kurds. \u201cTurkey is trying to repeat the same scenario of Afrin [a north-western Syrian town that was a Kurdish stronghold until a Turkish incursion in January last year]. The Turkish government\u2019s Kurdophobia is in the core of its policies.\u201d The announcement also failed to shed light on any implications for two large detention camps and two prisons which hold more than 130,000 suspected Isis members or supporters \u2013 the remnants of the collapsed so-called \u201ccaliphate\u201d which regarded north-east Syria as a centre of gravity until its battlefield defeat this year. The fate of the facilities had been of deep concern to regional and western states during the Turkish buildup, and senior diplomatic sources suggested the bilateral deal may have been struck to temper such fears. Though Isis no longer controls territory, there are strong and growing concerns that the organisation is using the camps to regroup and regenerate. Senior western officials had worried that Isis members could attempt an organised breakout, if Kurdish forces guarding them had been distracted by a war with the Turks. For much of the Syrian war, Turkey had been a full-throated supporter of the anti-Assad opposition, arming some insurgent groups and offering shelter to up to 4 million Syrians who had fled the fighting. However, over the past 18 months, its interests have narrowed and it now aims to shape the dying phase of the eight-year conflict along nationalist lines. Ankara\u2019s first priority is to try to ensure that Kurdish groups, which are allied to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), with which it continues to fight a four-decade-long insurgency inside its borders, do not emerge emboldened. Turkey insists Kurdish leaders with whom the US allied to fight Isis, under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), are ideologically and militarily allied to the PKK. \u201cThe fundamental issue is that the US supports the SDF, a group that Turkey views as a terrorist organisation,\u201d said Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East programme at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \u201cThe statement does not reconcile this fundamental issue, nor does it address a core divergence over how deep any zone would be. These remain to be resolved and, quite frankly, I don\u2019t see how to do that.\u201d A second issue for Ankara is Syrian refugees, whose fate has become a lightning rod for leaders on both sides of a divided political spectrum. \u201cThe refugee issue is fast nearing a tip-over in Turkey,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish programme at the Washington Institute. He said the impact of refugees on Turkish society could not be overestimated, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s the most significant demographic shift since the Greek/Turkish exchange of the 1920s. \u201cSouthern Turkey has become 10 to 15% Syrian, and with the economy slowing down resentment towards refugees is rising. \u201cErdo\u011fan is therefore very eager to have this issue go away. He\u2019s pressing hard for the safe zone, not just to undermine the YPG and the establishment of a PKK-allied state there but also to relocate a large number of refugees back to Syria. The statement out of the US embassy is significant: it shows that both sides have consensus on that.\u201d Stein suggested \u201cpotential violations of international law could hinder implementation\u201d of any forced refugee returns. The Syrian Democratic Council\u2019s Omar said any influx of Arab Syrians would not be tolerated. \u201cOur position has been very clear from the first day: any advance of Turkish forces and its allied armed groups into Syria is unacceptable. The recent agreement between the US and Turkey to build a new safe zone won\u2019t change our position.\u201d Additional reporting: Mohammed Rasool",

Will cause no bother at all.\u201d Interested parties are soon pounding on his door, asking him to sleep with a man\u2019s wife, drink scarab beetle juice, feed a vampire and solve a diplomatic mystery. Classic genre drama ensues: exotic foreigners appear, secret organisations are uncovered, men point guns at Hanio and women leap gratefully into his arms. Mishima was a nationalist who killed himself after his 1970 coup to restore the emperor\u2019s power failed, and here he stares unimpressed at a 1960s Tokyo awash with money and adverts, where manicured streets are overlooked by bland offices and self-indulgent hippies roam. It may be only a footnote in his career, but this surreal tale offers a trenchant critique of a city that has misplaced its soul. \u2022 Life for Sale by Yukio Mishima, translated by Stephen Dodd, is published by Penguin Classics (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<p>For decades Germans have extolled the benefits of free body culture \u2013 or being naked in nature. But a German sexologist has claimed that the practice of FKK, as it is widely known, is dying out due to a new \u201cnudity taboo\u201d.</p> <p>Once a focal point of German bathing culture, FKK has been pushed to the margins of most of Germany\u2019s beaches and lakesides, according to the author Kurt Starke.</p> <p>\u201cFKK is no longer a trend,\u201d he states in a new book, Nudity Congestion, in which he argues that a practice that once dominated large parts of German holiday resorts is now considered old-fashioned and too regulated. \u201cNow stretches of beach dedicated to FKK are reduced and often even combined with the stretches of beach reserved for dog walkers.\u201d</p> <p>The movement has its roots in the late 19th century when it was promoted as a healthy lifestyle, particularly for workers. The first FKK beach appeared on the North Sea coast 100 years ago. For more than 70 years entire sections of beaches, lakesides and campsites have been reserved by law for those who choose to be naked, and the practice \u2013 with its strict rejection of any shame about nudity \u2013 has seeped into the national psyche.</p> <p>The Nazis largely suppressed it. Revived again after the second world war, in the 1970s the FKK movement attracted its largest number of followers.</p> <p>Starke says that FKK, the first movement of its kind in the world, led to a widespread acceptance of public nudity without an overt connection to sexuality, which is reflected in Germans\u2019 relatively relaxed attitudes to nudity.</p> <p>But it was in the former communist east, the GDR, that its impact was most felt. There authorities positively encouraged it, particularly among the proletariat. While swimming aids such as lilos, rings and dinghies were banned for fear people might try to escape by sea to neighbouring Denmark, nudity was positively encouraged.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You never know if the naked person next to you is a doctor or a car park attendant, and it really doesn\u2019t matter'</p> <footer> <cite>Christian Utecht</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Christian Utecht, president of the Association of Free Body Culture for Berlin and Brandenburg, which has 3292 members, those who argue FKK is a dying trend are missing the bigger picture.</p> <p>\u201cFor sure, the movement\u2019s been hopelessly ageing for years, but those who follow it are complete advocates of it, and increasingly young families with children are now joining,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He blames a drop in membership on a social media-driven desire for the perfect body as well as a more multicultural society where newcomers are not so willing to accept the FKKlers\u2019 acceptance of public nudity.</p> <p>Utecht, from western Germany, admits he was \u201cnot born an FKKler\u201d \u2013 the name given to followers of the movement \u2013 but was introduced to it by his parents.

      "bodyText": "For decades Germans have extolled the benefits of free body culture \u2013 or being naked in nature. But a German sexologist has claimed that the practice of FKK, as it is widely known, is dying out due to a new \u201cnudity taboo\u201d. Once a focal point of German bathing culture, FKK has been pushed to the margins of most of Germany\u2019s beaches and lakesides, according to the author Kurt Starke. \u201cFKK is no longer a trend,\u201d he states in a new book, Nudity Congestion, in which he argues that a practice that once dominated large parts of German holiday resorts is now considered old-fashioned and too regulated. \u201cNow stretches of beach dedicated to FKK are reduced and often even combined with the stretches of beach reserved for dog walkers.\u201d The movement has its roots in the late 19th century when it was promoted as a healthy lifestyle, particularly for workers. The first FKK beach appeared on the North Sea coast 100 years ago. For more than 70 years entire sections of beaches, lakesides and campsites have been reserved by law for those who choose to be naked, and the practice \u2013 with its strict rejection of any shame about nudity \u2013 has seeped into the national psyche. The Nazis largely suppressed it. Revived again after the second world war, in the 1970s the FKK movement attracted its largest number of followers. Starke says that FKK, the first movement of its kind in the world, led to a widespread acceptance of public nudity without an overt connection to sexuality, which is reflected in Germans\u2019 relatively relaxed attitudes to nudity. But it was in the former communist east, the GDR, that its impact was most felt. There authorities positively encouraged it, particularly among the proletariat. While swimming aids such as lilos, rings and dinghies were banned for fear people might try to escape by sea to neighbouring Denmark, nudity was positively encouraged. For Christian Utecht, president of the Association of Free Body Culture for Berlin and Brandenburg, which has 3292 members, those who argue FKK is a dying trend are missing the bigger picture. \u201cFor sure, the movement\u2019s been hopelessly ageing for years, but those who follow it are complete advocates of it, and increasingly young families with children are now joining,\u201d he said. He blames a drop in membership on a social media-driven desire for the perfect body as well as a more multicultural society where newcomers are not so willing to accept the FKKlers\u2019 acceptance of public nudity. Utecht, from western Germany, admits he was \u201cnot born an FKKler\u201d \u2013 the name given to followers of the movement \u2013 but was introduced to it by his parents. He liked it, he says, because \u201cI don\u2019t like wearing wet swimming trunks\u201d. His association hosts flea markets, summer camps, fun-runs and even open days. And it extols the health benefits of FKK, such as the promotion of exercise and being outdoors. \u201cWe have members in their 80s who are extremely active,\u201d Utecht said. FKK is also a great leveller, he argued. \u201cYou never know if the naked person next to you is a doctor or a car park attendant, and it really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Nationwide the FKK association has about 32,000 members, a number that has halved since 1980. But those naturist organisations seeing a growth in their membership are those that combine sport and nudity, such as the Adolf Koch Association in Berlin, named after one of the main founders of FKK, which offers everything from nude volleyball to nude yoga and has doubled its membership in the past two years. In the summer months club members meet outside; in winter, in a sports hall. Knee pads and other protective clothing is allowed, shorts are not. Neither is the taking of photographs.

Henri will live on in our hearts and minds forever.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Casablanca in 1936, Belolo began his career as a producer, concert promoter and A&amp;R man in Paris, where he worked with artists including film star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/jul/31/jeanne-moreau-intelligent-complex-star-french-new-wave-jules-et-jim\">Jeanne Moreau</a>. In 1973, he moved to New York where he formed the Village People with producer Jacques Morali and singer Victor Willis. With their emphatic embrace of gay stereotypes and their uplifting disco tracks, the group reached No 1 in the UK with YMCA and No 2 with In the Navy. Both songs also reached the Top 3 in the US.</p> <p>Belolo, who was straight, and not one of the performers in the flamboyant six-member group, formed Village People after he and Morali saw future member Felipe Rose dancing in a gay bar dressed as a Native American. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the Indian, and on my left I saw a cowboy, like the Marlboro cowboy,\u201d Belolo remembered <a href=\"https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/04/henri-belolo-interview\">in 2004</a>. \u201cStetson on his head, a moustache, good-looking, looking at the Indian dancing.

      "bodyText": "Henri Belolo, a co-founder of pop group Village People, has died aged 82. The group confirmed the news on their Facebook page, along with Belolo\u2019s record label Scorpio, who wrote in tribute: \u201cWe extend our deepest sympathies to Henri\u2019s family ... Henri will live on in our hearts and minds forever.\u201d Born in Casablanca in 1936, Belolo began his career as a producer, concert promoter and A&amp;R man in Paris, where he worked with artists including film star Jeanne Moreau. In 1973, he moved to New York where he formed the Village People with producer Jacques Morali and singer Victor Willis. With their emphatic embrace of gay stereotypes and their uplifting disco tracks, the group reached No 1 in the UK with YMCA and No 2 with In the Navy. Both songs also reached the Top 3 in the US. Belolo, who was straight, and not one of the performers in the flamboyant six-member group, formed Village People after he and Morali saw future member Felipe Rose dancing in a gay bar dressed as a Native American. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the Indian, and on my left I saw a cowboy, like the Marlboro cowboy,\u201d Belolo remembered in 2004. \u201cStetson on his head, a moustache, good-looking, looking at the Indian dancing. And Morali turned to me and said, \u2018Oh God, are you thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u2019\u201d Belolo said he formed the group, in part, as a way to champion gay rights. \u201cI really did it as a provocative, subversive way of telling you: this is the way it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not like that American mentality of bigotry and hypocrisy.\u201d He was credited as a co-writer on the group\u2019s hits, though his name was later removed from a number of them after a successful lawsuit from Willis, who claimed he wrote the English-language lyrics for the group. Belolo\u2019s company had argued he wrote French lyrics that Willis adapted. Willis has nevertheless paid tribute to Belolo, saying he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the news and that Belolo \u201cleaves an impressive body of work that helped shape the disco genre, and as a record executive, he was par excellence\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "An Australian farming group has called for a fully funded national strategy to deal with climate change and agriculture, warning farmers don\u2019t have enough support to manage increasing risks associated with global heating. It comes as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on climate change and land, released in Geneva on Thursday, found limiting global heating to below 2C can only be achieved by reducing emissions from all sectors \u2013 including land and food. That will involve transforming food production and land management, given agriculture, forestry and other types of land use account for 23% of human-induced greenhouse emissions globally. The report finds even the current levels of global heating are increasing the risks of water scarcity, soil erosion, vegetation loss, fire damage, coastal degradation, permafrost thawing and declines in crop yields. It finds the climate crisis is affecting all aspects of food security \u2013 including availability, price and nutrition \u2013 but that coordinated action to cut global emissions could simultaneously improve land resources, food security and nutrition and help to address hunger. Verity Morgan-Schmidt, the chief executive of Farmers for Climate Action, said Australian farmers were already dealing with the effects of global heating, including worsening droughts, changing frost conditions and heatwaves. But as the risks associated with global heating increase, she said it was becoming more difficult for farmers to adapt on their own. Farmers are responsible for managing much of Australia\u2019s ecosystem, with 48% of Australia\u2019s land privately owned or leased for agricultural production. Morgan-Schmidt said industry-wide measures were already being developed to reduce the sector\u2019s climate footprint, including a grains industry sustainability framework that is under development and the red meat sector\u2019s target to become carbon neutral by 2030. She said individual farmers were also taking action through increased soil carbon sequestration, revegetation, and the adoption of \u201cclimate-smart\u201d agricultural practices. But she said an overarching government strategy for the agriculture sector was still lacking and farmers were looking to the federal government to better coordinate currently disparate efforts by industry, government and the non-government sector to deal with climate. \u201cWhat we still don\u2019t have in the year 2019 is a national strategy on climate change in agriculture. There\u2019s still no actual framework to help farmers manage these risks and implement solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re calling for a fully funded national strategy on climate change and agriculture. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good things happening but there is more work to do and we need support to do that.\u201d The minister for energy and emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, said: \u201cThe government recognises the importance of the land sector to Australia and is partnering with industry to improve productivity, sustainability and resilience.\u201d \u201cOur suite of policies include the establishment of a Future Drought Fund, a national program of water reform, and the Emissions Reduction Fund which supports Australian businesses, farmers and land managers to take practical actions to reduce emissions and improve the environment.\u201d Mark Howden, the director of the ANU Climate Institute and an IPCC vice-chair, is one of the report\u2019s authors. He said the climate crisis was \u201crapidly ramping up existing threats to the land, reducing its ability to feed and support populations around the world and impacting on ecosystems\u201d. \u201cAt the same time, the land sector is currently contributing to climate change, even as it potentially offers some of the solutions to reducing greenhouse gases,\u201d he said. Howden said the land sector alone could not address the crisis and that cutting emissions from fossil fuels remained \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d. But he said improving land management would have multiple economic, environmental and health benefits. \u201cBetter land management not only delivers win-wins for farmers, communities, governments and biodiversity but also helps address climate change,\u201d he said.

Then together they dream up the idea of making this more communal and more subversive: \u201cWhat could violate social convention more than women coming together to indulge their hunger and taking up space?\u201d They want to expand and to be nourished, \u201cto be full up, instead of hungry and wanting, all the time\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The writing becomes most moving when we sense her pushing against her bounds, while not quite knowing how to do so</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At first these are fairly safe, albeit joyfully debauched occasions involving a small group of women. They hire restaurants and forage food from supermarket bins. Each evening has a theme, so they dress up as literary heroines, brides or sea creatures. They throw food, take drugs and tear at chunks of meat with their hands. They talk, they shout, they dance, they vomit and then the next day Roberta cleans up. She and Stevie are now so close that they share a bed. Most of their friends are lesbians, and so is Stevie\u2019s mother, but they don\u2019t name theirs as a sexual relationship and Roberta is easily seduced by Adnan, a good-looking flatmate from university who pulls her into a \u201cnormal\u201d heterosexual life, persuading her to move in with him. She keeps the supper club a secret, not knowing how to explain it. But Stevie raises the stakes, insisting they must start breaking the law.</p> <p>The central theme here is women\u2019s oppression by men, and Williams\u2019s take on it is powerful and original. These are women who are prepared to change bodily, putting on hefty amounts of weight as they commit to the principle of being more characterful and less likable than they believe men want them to be. \u201cNot everything is nice,\u201d Roberta tells Adnan at one point. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m never nice enough for you.\u201d The joy of food \u2013 its capacity to be so pleasurable that it can subvert niceness \u2013 is well described, as is the complexity of cooking. There are some lengthy digressions on the kitchen that maintain enough obsessive verve to be engaging, allowing Williams to take the material of the domestic novel and turn it into something more explosive. She suggests convincingly that cooking is as rigorous and complex as any art form and that Roberta is using food to live a full creative life, albeit one necessarily blighted by anticlimax, as the creations disappear into stomachs or bins. Throughout, there\u2019s helpful nuance provided by Roberta\u2019s uncertainty and self-questioning. She\u2019s open to the possibilities that some men aren\u2019t oppressing them after all, that Adnan is reasonable to want a girlfriend who doesn\u2019t break into department stores or vomit on her return from dinner, that it\u2019s Stevie who\u2019s manipulative and overdemanding.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/05/best-books-of-2019-so-far\">Best books of 2019 so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I sometimes found their preoccupations and mental states a little overdeterminedly millennial. All these young women are lost in the world of work, anxious and inadequate; Roberta regularly self-harms. But the point here may be that she and her friends feel trapped by their generation and its stereotypes as well. Certainly the writing becomes most insightful and moving when we sense her pushing against her bounds, while not quite knowing how to do so. \u201cI was still so afraid and yet so desirous of everything.

At first these are fairly safe, albeit joyfully debauched occasions involving a small group of women. They hire restaurants and forage food from supermarket bins. Each evening has a theme, so they dress up as literary heroines, brides or sea creatures. They throw food, take drugs and tear at chunks of meat with their hands. They talk, they shout, they dance, they vomit and then the next day Roberta cleans up. She and Stevie are now so close that they share a bed. Most of their friends are lesbians, and so is Stevie\u2019s mother, but they don\u2019t name theirs as a sexual relationship and Roberta is easily seduced by Adnan, a good-looking flatmate from university who pulls her into a \u201cnormal\u201d heterosexual life, persuading her to move in with him. She keeps the supper club a secret, not knowing how to explain it. But Stevie raises the stakes, insisting they must start breaking the law. The central theme here is women\u2019s oppression by men, and Williams\u2019s take on it is powerful and original. These are women who are prepared to change bodily, putting on hefty amounts of weight as they commit to the principle of being more characterful and less likable than they believe men want them to be. \u201cNot everything is nice,\u201d Roberta tells Adnan at one point. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m never nice enough for you.\u201d The joy of food \u2013 its capacity to be so pleasurable that it can subvert niceness \u2013 is well described, as is the complexity of cooking. There are some lengthy digressions on the kitchen that maintain enough obsessive verve to be engaging, allowing Williams to take the material of the domestic novel and turn it into something more explosive. She suggests convincingly that cooking is as rigorous and complex as any art form and that Roberta is using food to live a full creative life, albeit one necessarily blighted by anticlimax, as the creations disappear into stomachs or bins. Throughout, there\u2019s helpful nuance provided by Roberta\u2019s uncertainty and self-questioning. She\u2019s open to the possibilities that some men aren\u2019t oppressing them after all, that Adnan is reasonable to want a girlfriend who doesn\u2019t break into department stores or vomit on her return from dinner, that it\u2019s Stevie who\u2019s manipulative and overdemanding. I sometimes found their preoccupations and mental states a little overdeterminedly millennial. All these young women are lost in the world of work, anxious and inadequate; Roberta regularly self-harms. But the point here may be that she and her friends feel trapped by their generation and its stereotypes as well. Certainly the writing becomes most insightful and moving when we sense her pushing against her bounds, while not quite knowing how to do so. \u201cI was still so afraid and yet so desirous of everything. Fear and freedom, occupying opposite ends of the spectrum, though inexorably tied.\u201d \u2022 Lara Feigel is the author of Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing (Bloomsbury).

      "bodyText": "The climate crisis is damaging the ability of the land to sustain humanity, with cascading risks becoming increasingly severe as global temperatures rise, according to a landmark UN report compiled by some of the world\u2019s top scientists. Global heating is increasing droughts, soil erosion and wildfires while diminishing crop yields in the tropics and thawing permafrost near the poles, says the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Further heating will lead to unprecedented climate conditions at lower latitudes, with potential growth in hunger, migration and conflict and increased damage to the great northern forests.

      "bodyText": "Healthy land provides the food, timber and fresh water essential to humanity\u2019s survival, but a UN report says the climate crisis is damaging this precious resource with potentially irreversible consequences. The abuse of land by razing forests, intensive farming and loss of soils also produces a quarter of global emissions, further worsening the climate emergency, says the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It says ending the degradation of land can play an important role in securing a liveable planet by cutting emissions, providing sustainable food and reducing poverty. \u201cWhat the IPCC highlights is that we urgently need a revolution in the way we currently utilise land,\u201d said Anna Krzywoszynska, of the University of Sheffield. \u201cFood systems today are built not on soil but on the oil needed for chemicals and machinery.\u201d Clare Oxborrow, of Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThe way land is being used and abused is rebounding on us. The scientific evidence is clear: political leaders must transform the way land and resources are used, otherwise life on Earth just won\u2019t be possible.\u201d Land is heating up faster than the oceans: the average surface temperature is now 1.5C higher than in the late 19th century. This is already affecting food security, the IPPC report says, as heat, drought and changes in rainfall damage crops. Prof Pete Smith, of the University of Aberdeen, who was one of the report\u2019s authors, said the food system would not be able to feed the world if global heating surged beyond 2C. \u201cGoing into a world where we are way above 2C has massive implications for the food system and production in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get more droughts, more people going without food and who need more disaster relief. It\u2019s a place we don\u2019t want to go.\u201d The burning of fossil fuels is the biggest source of carbon emissions and is still rising, despite the need for urgent cuts. But land use causes a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, half from forest destruction and half from farming, including methane from cattle and rice paddies and nitrous oxide from chemical fertiliser use and manure. The exploitation of land and fresh water today is unprecedented in human history, the IPCC report says. Three-quarters of all ice-free land is used by humans. Rising global population and consumption is driving the loss of 10bn trees a year and meat consumption has doubled since 1961. Intensive farming means soil is being lost 100 times as fast as it is being formed in ploughed fields. However, the IPCC report says solutions exist. Among the most important is halting the destruction of forest, peatlands and wetlands, which store huge amounts of carbon and can absorb more if left undisturbed. \u201cConserving what we have got is the first thing to do,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt is also a quick win that delivers across a whole range of things we want to do to preserve a liveable planet,\u201d including halting the annihilation of wildlife, which some scientists think is the start of a new mass extinction. Enabling the restoration of forests is also important, as is using farming techniques that preserve rather than erode soils. Cutting the amount of meat and dairy products eaten in rich nations is a \u201cmajor opportunity\u201d, the IPPC report says, due to the heavy environmental impact of intensively reared cattle. Drastically reducing food waste \u2013 25-30% of all food is never eaten \u2013 is a priority as well. Another opportunity is to help smallholder farmers around the world sustainably increase their yields, including by breeding new crop varieties that better withstand heat and drought. Bioenergy crops have been suggested as a way to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but the IPCC report warns that large-scale use could conflict with growing food, with serious consequences for food security. The report says global heating could boost some crops in higher and cooler latitudes as growing seasons get longer and higher levels of CO2 in the air fertilises plants. \u201cBut in terms of global food production and food access it is definitely a net negative,\u201d said Smith, as the most vulnerable populations live at lower latitudes such as in sub-Saharan Africa and India, where fierce temperatures will harm crops. The special role of indigenous people is highlighted in the report. \u201cFinally, the world\u2019s top scientists recognise what we have always known,\u201d said a statement by indigenous and community leaders from 42 countries that account for 76% of the world\u2019s tropical forests. \u201cWe play a critical role in safeguarding the world\u2019s lands and forests.

      "bodyText": "The introduction of a statutory requirement for doctors to gain \u201cinformed consent\u201d before performing abortions in New South Wales will cause confusion and create an unnecessary \u201cextra hurdle\u201d to accessing a termination, the Australian Medical Association has warned. The historic, cross-party bill to decriminalise abortion in NSW is being debated on the floor of the state\u2019s parliament on Thursday, with wrangling over proposed amendments expected to go late into the night or even early Friday morning. While a number of the amendments have been defeated, one change which means doctors will be required to receive \u201cinformed consent\u201d before performing abortions did pass 49-41 despite being opposed by the bill\u2019s co-sponsors. The AMA had previously called the amendment \u201cunnecessary and insulting\u201d because it \u201cis already a requirement on doctors\u201d and on Thursday the association\u2019s vice president in NSW, Danielle McMullen, said the passing of the amendment risked creating confusion for doctors and patients. \u201cOur concern with having it as a seperate, statutory requirement within legislation is that it implies there is some extra hurdle when really there shouldn\u2019t be, it should be the status quo for doctors who already receive informed consent in any medical interaction and particularly medical procedure,\u201d she said. \u201cInformed consent is a standard part of clinical practice and the concern with it being [in] the bill is that it adds confusion, and an extra layer to the process, so that termination of pregnancy is different to every other procedure we perform. \u201cWe would strongly refute that and say a termination is a medical procedure like any other.\u201d As the debate continued into Thursday evening, a number of amendments that would require women seeking an abortion undergo mandatory counselling continued to be debated. While some were defeated, variations of that proposal continued to be put. Earlier, a proposal to place increased restrictions on women seeking abortions after 22 weeks was scrapped, after a last-minute compromise on the floor of the parliament. The original bill made it through the first vote 56 to 33, but MPs are still debating more than a dozen amendments to the legislation. An early bid to delay the bill by referring it to a committee failed, as did an attempt to move the point at which a pregnant woman would need the approval of two doctors before undergoing a termination from 22 to 20 weeks. Two senior Liberal party ministers, Mark Speakman and Rob Stokes, had earlier flagged they would move amendments that would have placed new restrictions on terminations after 22 weeks. The amendment would have meant a pregnant woman would need the approval of a four-person hospital advisory committee, rather than a second medical practitioner as proposed under the original bill. On Wednesday the Australian Medical Association called that plan \u201cconcerning\u201d, saying it would \u201cplace women at significant risk of unnecessary delay and only add to their suffering, particularly women in regional and rural areas\u201d. \u201cIn the vast majority of cases, abortions after 22 weeks arise due to a significant abnormality in the foetus,\u201d the AMA said. \u201cFamilies and their doctors already face the most difficult decision of whether to end a wanted pregnancy and these amendments would draw out that process and make it more painful.\u201d But on Thursday Speakman told the parliament he would withdraw the amendment, saying he and Stokes had mistakenly believed that such advisory bodies were already \u201cinvariable practice\u201d. \u201cOur amendments have been intended not to preclude anything that is currently happening with late term abortions in NSW [but] rather, given the gravity of what are life and death decisions made at this late stage to reflect a light touch of regulation in the bill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is clear now that these advisory committees aren\u2019t the invariable practice and it was never intended to put up something that would impede relatively rare late term terminations happening now. \u201cI have been called many things and am worthy of many criticisms but I don\u2019t think any one has ever called me, until the last 24 hours, an extremist.\u201d Instead, the 15 co-sponsors supporting the original bill agreed to change the definition of the two doctors who must sign-off on a termination after 22 weeks so that at-least one must be a specialist obstetrician or gynaecologist. Despite having the support of MPs from across the major parties, including the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and the health minister, Brad Hazzard, the bill has been subjected to significant pushback from conservative MPs, the Catholic church and anti-abortion activists. Both major parties have a conscience vote on the bill, and on the floor of the parliament on Thursday Liberal ministers found themselves arguing on opposite sides of the chamber, with Hazzard leading the supporters of the bill while Speakman and Stokes worked with opponents of the bill. Before question time on Thursday one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, the Liberal MP Leslie Williams, moved amendments around the location of where late-term abortions must take place in an attempt to placate wavering voters which passed without opposition.",

Both the brand, which asserts that staff were acting independently, and the store, which says it knew nothing of the event, apologised and quickly cancelled the workshop after parents complained.</p> <p>Few would disagree with the decision. An eyebrow pencil or foundation is incongruous and inappropriate in this context, and should not be billed as essential back-to-school kit, like some new lunchbox or protractor. Makeup is against uniform code in most schools and even where it\u2019s not it\u2019s very dubious to suggest that pupils should aspire to look a certain way on their return to an environment that should be about learning, and away from the real and escalating pressures to look good.</p> <p>But the row has caused these legitimate concerns to be conflated with the question of whether young teenagers and children should wear makeup at all and if so, when, as if an eye palette is as wicked and harmful as a keg of snakebite and a carton of fags.</p> <p>There is nothing inherently dangerous or provocative about pots, pans and tubes of colour, only about the prejudicial, problematic and patronising assumptions that society makes about them.

      "bodyText": "John Lewis and Mac Cosmetics have come under fire for advertising a \u201cback to school\u201d makeup masterclass on Facebook, in which school-age pupils were promised tips on achieving good-looking skin, and eyebrows \u201con fleek\u201d, at the Mac counter in John Lewis\u2019s Bluewater branch. Both the brand, which asserts that staff were acting independently, and the store, which says it knew nothing of the event, apologised and quickly cancelled the workshop after parents complained. Few would disagree with the decision. An eyebrow pencil or foundation is incongruous and inappropriate in this context, and should not be billed as essential back-to-school kit, like some new lunchbox or protractor. Makeup is against uniform code in most schools and even where it\u2019s not it\u2019s very dubious to suggest that pupils should aspire to look a certain way on their return to an environment that should be about learning, and away from the real and escalating pressures to look good. But the row has caused these legitimate concerns to be conflated with the question of whether young teenagers and children should wear makeup at all and if so, when, as if an eye palette is as wicked and harmful as a keg of snakebite and a carton of fags. There is nothing inherently dangerous or provocative about pots, pans and tubes of colour, only about the prejudicial, problematic and patronising assumptions that society makes about them. Let kids of any age play safely and freely with makeup, turning their faces into whatever temporary pictures they like. It\u2019s how adults then frame them that has the real impact. Mac says it has a policy of never marketing its products to under-16s, and has never held a workshop for children, but many brands have.

It generally works pretty well but most people have probably suffered from a USB device failing or not being recognised.</p> <p>Lots of things can go wrong.

This can be a problem if the PC\u2019s motherboard does not supply enough power to the USB port you are using or if the drive is plugged into a non-powered hub. EHDs that have their own power supplies tend to work more reliably.</p> <p>USB cables can fail after prolonged use, though this is more likely to happen to the Micro USB cables used with mobile phones. External hard drive cables rarely fail unless they get the same sort of abuse. However, if you have two devices that use the same type of cable, you can swap them over to see if that solves the problem.</p> <p>Alternatively, it could be a software problem. For example, it could be the lack of a suitable driver, a corrupted driver or a conflict with another USB device.</p> <p>If you do not have a backup and cannot get the drive to work, it may be worth rolling back to Windows 7 and making a backup before reinstalling Windows 10 \u2013 or enlisting the help of a friend who is still running Windows 7.</p> <h2><strong>Back up, back up, back up</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"526c29dc312bb5bde23463c0be443e0acffc6b53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/526c29dc312bb5bde23463c0be443e0acffc6b53/0_434_4722_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"USB flash drives are useful for creating cheap backups.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">USB flash drives are useful for creating cheap backups.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You should never lose data because an external USB hard drive fails. Ideally, you should have at least three copies of your photos stored on different media and at least one should be kept in a different place. Schofield\u2019s Second Law of Computing states that <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/follow-schofields-three-laws-of-computing-and-avoid-disasters/\">data doesn\u2019t really exist unless you have at least two copies of it</a>.</p> <p>You can back up your photos to thumb drives, SD cards, optical discs (CD, DVD, Blu-ray), external hard drives, a local network server or an online service. These include Amazon Photos, Apple\u2019s iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive, Google One and third-party services such as pCloud and Mega.NZ. See my recent answer to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/jun/20/wheres-the-cheapest-place-to-store-500gb-of-data-online\">Where\u2019s the cheapest place to store 500GB of data online?</a>\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Diagnostic software</strong></h2> <p>The major hard drive manufacturers have the most experience in debugging hard drive problems and some have free software to help. The leading examples include WD\u2019s <a href=\"https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6226\">Data Lifeguard Diagnostics</a> and Seagate\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/gb/en/support/downloads/seatools/seatools-win-master/\">SeaTools for Windows</a>. You may already have one installed. If not, check your EHD manufacturer\u2019s website for a tool that could find and fix your missing drive.</p> <h2><strong>Simple debugging</strong></h2> <p>Most USB failures are glitches. Often, if a device is not recognised by one port, it will work when plugged into a different port or a different PC. If not, the traditional approach \u2013 basically, turning your PC off and on again \u2013 often works.</p> <p>First, unplug the EHD, unplug it from the mains and unplug and straighten the data cable. Second, restart your PC and wait for two minutes (because Windows 10 keeps loading things in the background even after it claims to be ready for use). Third, plug the connecting cable into the EHD, making sure it is firmly seated. Finally, plug the EHD back into the mains, turn it on (if it has a manual switch) and plug the USB cable back into the PC. With luck, either the PC will recognise the external drive or discover it as a new device and install it with a suitable driver.</p> <p>Turning a PC off and on does not work as well as it used to because of Windows 10\u2019s Fast Startup system. Ideally, we want the PC to forget everything and make a fresh start. With Fast Startup, Windows 10 stores core parts of memory, including the drivers, in a hidden file called hiberfil.sys and just reloads this file when you turn it back on. You could temporarily <a href=\"https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4189-turn-off-fast-startup-windows-10-a.html\">disable Fast Startup</a> but I\u2019d just move on to the next step.</p> <h2><strong>Uninstall, reconnect</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"568912b81718f85bc7551f36590a184639b6642b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/568912b81718f85bc7551f36590a184639b6642b/0_0_1649_898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Device Manager is the program you need to manage drivers and see whether there\u2019s a problem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"545\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Device Manager is the program you need to manage drivers and see whether there\u2019s a problem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If a reboot doesn\u2019t make Windows renew its USB drivers, you can do it manually. With the EHD plugged in, go to the Start menu and type or paste the words \u201cDevice Manager\u201d into the search box, then run the app that comes up. Next, click the arrow (&gt;) next to \u201cDisk drives\u201d in the Device Manager program to see a list of the drives that your PC knows about. Look for the drive that is not being recognised. It should be obvious from its name, which might be something like \u201cWD Ext HDD 1021 USB Device\u201d or \u201cWD MyBook\u201d or \u201cSeagate Expansion Desk\u201d, or whatever.</p> <p>Right-click on your EHD and select \u201cUninstall device\u201d from the pop-up menu. When that has finished, unplug the USB cable.</p> <p>Wait a minute, then plug the USB cable back in. Windows should see the drive and install a driver. Your EHD should then appear in the \u201cThis PC\u201d section of Windows 10\u2019s File Explorer.</p> <p>If this doesn\u2019t work, use the Settings app to run Windows Update, restart your PC and try again. Windows Update delivers new drivers and software patches when they become available.</p> <p>Some \u2013 usually obscure \u2013 USB peripherals use special drivers that you can only download from the manufacturer\u2019s website. If Windows hasn\u2019t found the best driver, it might be worth looking for one. If you find one, follow the same procedure but select \u201cUpdate driver\u201d from the menu.</p> <p>In passing, users who have no problems with external drives can still use Device Manager. The default setting for USB drives allows their quick removal. This reduces the risk of data corruption when users unplug drives without thinking. Select \u201cProperties\u201d from the pop-up menu, go to the \u201cPolicies\u201d tab and change the default to enable write caching in Windows. This improves performance but you must use the \u201cSafely Remove Hardware\u201d option before unplugging devices.</p> <h2><strong>Trash your USB controllers</strong></h2> <p>USB ports are handled by USB host controllers. To see them, click the arrow next to \u201cUniversal Serial Bus controllers\u201d, which will be at or near the bottom of the alphabetical list in Device Manager. As before, right-click each host controller and select Uninstall. Once you have finished, restart your PC. Windows will automatically reinstall the USB host controllers with clean, fresh versions.</p> <p>Beyond this, there is not much you can do. If a PC has serious problems, you could always reinstall the BIOS firmware and update the motherboard\u2019s chipset drivers. The latest versions should be available from the PC or motherboard manufacturer\u2019s website. However, non-technical users should never have to do this type of thing unless prompted.</p> <p>For example, you may have done a firmware update last year because most big PC suppliers rolled out fixes for the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities covered in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/jan/25/what-can-i-do-to-protect-my-pc-from-meltdown-spectre-flaws\">an earlier answer</a>. But it shouldn\u2019t be necessary for a simple problem like a USB drive not being recognised.</p> <h2><strong>Rescue your data</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c14a1a81d1a298626101ebd389bf446f5200047\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c14a1a81d1a298626101ebd389bf446f5200047/0_0_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sometimes taking out the hard drive and putting it into a new enclosure is the only way.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sometimes taking out the hard drive and putting it into a new enclosure is the only way.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All hard drives fail, typically after five or more years but sometimes after a few months. This is why we need backups. Sometimes EHDs fail but the drive still works. If you don\u2019t have a backup and cannot afford a <a href=\"https://www.ontrack.com/uk/services/data-recovery/\">professional data recovery service</a>, this is a last resort.</p> <p>USB drives are just cheap hard drives in (usually) plastic enclosures. You can easily make your own by buying <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seagate-BarraCuda-Internal-Drive-Cache/dp/B07D9C7SQH/\">a big hard drive</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=3.5+inch+sata+hard+drive+enclosure&amp;i=computers\">a separate enclosure</a>. If your EHD doesn\u2019t work but you can hear the drive spin up when it is plugged in, you can try removing the hard drive and installing it in a new enclosure.</p> <p>Research your EHD online to find out how big the drive is (2.5 inch or 3.5 inch) and the type of drive (usually SATA), so you can buy the correct enclosure. Plastic enclosures are cheap and mostly good enough. Metal enclosures with built-in fans are better for cooling a hard drive that is in constant use and making it last longer.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question?

You can back up your photos to thumb drives, SD cards, optical discs (CD, DVD, Blu-ray), external hard drives, a local network server or an online service. These include Amazon Photos, Apple\u2019s iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive, Google One and third-party services such as pCloud and Mega.NZ. See my recent answer to \u201cWhere\u2019s the cheapest place to store 500GB of data online?\u201d Diagnostic software The major hard drive manufacturers have the most experience in debugging hard drive problems and some have free software to help. The leading examples include WD\u2019s Data Lifeguard Diagnostics and Seagate\u2019s SeaTools for Windows. You may already have one installed. If not, check your EHD manufacturer\u2019s website for a tool that could find and fix your missing drive. Simple debugging Most USB failures are glitches. Often, if a device is not recognised by one port, it will work when plugged into a different port or a different PC. If not, the traditional approach \u2013 basically, turning your PC off and on again \u2013 often works. First, unplug the EHD, unplug it from the mains and unplug and straighten the data cable. Second, restart your PC and wait for two minutes (because Windows 10 keeps loading things in the background even after it claims to be ready for use). Third, plug the connecting cable into the EHD, making sure it is firmly seated. Finally, plug the EHD back into the mains, turn it on (if it has a manual switch) and plug the USB cable back into the PC. With luck, either the PC will recognise the external drive or discover it as a new device and install it with a suitable driver. Turning a PC off and on does not work as well as it used to because of Windows 10\u2019s Fast Startup system. Ideally, we want the PC to forget everything and make a fresh start. With Fast Startup, Windows 10 stores core parts of memory, including the drivers, in a hidden file called hiberfil.sys and just reloads this file when you turn it back on. You could temporarily disable Fast Startup but I\u2019d just move on to the next step. Uninstall, reconnect If a reboot doesn\u2019t make Windows renew its USB drivers, you can do it manually. With the EHD plugged in, go to the Start menu and type or paste the words \u201cDevice Manager\u201d into the search box, then run the app that comes up. Next, click the arrow (&gt;) next to \u201cDisk drives\u201d in the Device Manager program to see a list of the drives that your PC knows about. Look for the drive that is not being recognised. It should be obvious from its name, which might be something like \u201cWD Ext HDD 1021 USB Device\u201d or \u201cWD MyBook\u201d or \u201cSeagate Expansion Desk\u201d, or whatever. Right-click on your EHD and select \u201cUninstall device\u201d from the pop-up menu. When that has finished, unplug the USB cable. Wait a minute, then plug the USB cable back in. Windows should see the drive and install a driver. Your EHD should then appear in the \u201cThis PC\u201d section of Windows 10\u2019s File Explorer. If this doesn\u2019t work, use the Settings app to run Windows Update, restart your PC and try again. Windows Update delivers new drivers and software patches when they become available. Some \u2013 usually obscure \u2013 USB peripherals use special drivers that you can only download from the manufacturer\u2019s website. If Windows hasn\u2019t found the best driver, it might be worth looking for one. If you find one, follow the same procedure but select \u201cUpdate driver\u201d from the menu. In passing, users who have no problems with external drives can still use Device Manager. The default setting for USB drives allows their quick removal. This reduces the risk of data corruption when users unplug drives without thinking. Select \u201cProperties\u201d from the pop-up menu, go to the \u201cPolicies\u201d tab and change the default to enable write caching in Windows. This improves performance but you must use the \u201cSafely Remove Hardware\u201d option before unplugging devices. Trash your USB controllers USB ports are handled by USB host controllers. To see them, click the arrow next to \u201cUniversal Serial Bus controllers\u201d, which will be at or near the bottom of the alphabetical list in Device Manager. As before, right-click each host controller and select Uninstall. Once you have finished, restart your PC. Windows will automatically reinstall the USB host controllers with clean, fresh versions. Beyond this, there is not much you can do. If a PC has serious problems, you could always reinstall the BIOS firmware and update the motherboard\u2019s chipset drivers. The latest versions should be available from the PC or motherboard manufacturer\u2019s website. However, non-technical users should never have to do this type of thing unless prompted. For example, you may have done a firmware update last year because most big PC suppliers rolled out fixes for the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities covered in an earlier answer. But it shouldn\u2019t be necessary for a simple problem like a USB drive not being recognised. Rescue your data All hard drives fail, typically after five or more years but sometimes after a few months. This is why we need backups. Sometimes EHDs fail but the drive still works. If you don\u2019t have a backup and cannot afford a professional data recovery service, this is a last resort. USB drives are just cheap hard drives in (usually) plastic enclosures. You can easily make your own by buying a big hard drive and a separate enclosure. If your EHD doesn\u2019t work but you can hear the drive spin up when it is plugged in, you can try removing the hard drive and installing it in a new enclosure. Research your EHD online to find out how big the drive is (2.5 inch or 3.5 inch) and the type of drive (usually SATA), so you can buy the correct enclosure. Plastic enclosures are cheap and mostly good enough. Metal enclosures with built-in fans are better for cooling a hard drive that is in constant use and making it last longer.

      "body": "<p>In novels spanning several hundred years of history, Toni Morrison used her historical imagination and her remarkable gifts of language to chronicle the horrors of slavery and Jim Crow, and their continuing fallout on the everyday lives of black Americans. Violent, heart-wrenching events occur in her fiction: a runaway slave named Sethe cuts the throat of her baby daughter with a handsaw to spare her the fate she suffered herself as a slave (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1987/oct/16/fiction.asbyatt\" title=\"\"><em>Beloved</em></a>); a cosmetics salesman hunts down his lover and shoots her dead (<em>Jazz</em>); a woman pours kerosene on her drug-addicted son and sets him on fire (<em>Sula</em>). Such horrifying events are acts of desperation that can be comprehended only in the context of the earlier tragedies these characters or their families have suffered. In fact, if there is one insistent theme in Morrison\u2019s novels, it\u2019s the ways in which the past inexorably shapes the present, erasing innocence, cutting off options of escape, and warping relationships between women and men, parents and children.</p> <p>As in William Faulkner\u2019s work, the past is never dead for Morrison\u2019s people \u2013 it\u2019s not even past. Faulkner was clearly an influence on Morrison\u2019s writing, as were Ralph Ellison, Virginia Woolf, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and African American folklore. But Morrison forged from such disparate sources a voice that was all her own \u2013 fierce, poetic and Proustian in its ability to fuse time present and time past.</p> <p>Her 1987 masterpiece <em>Beloved</em> created a harrowing portrait of slavery that possesses all the resonance of a classical myth, while remaining grounded in the awful particulars of American history. <em>Song of Solomon</em> stands as a quintessential bildungsroman \u2013 the story of one man\u2019s coming of age and rebirth, recounted in a narrative that spans allegory, realism and fable. And novels such as <em>The Bluest Eye</em> and <em>Sula</em> attest that Morrison was equally at home chronicling small-town life in the mid-20th century, with its insular dynamics and slowly shifting mores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"43bf421f958240a5e37dc141a20dd37ba2f938e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43bf421f958240a5e37dc141a20dd37ba2f938e4/0_0_6054_4370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey in the 1998 film adaptation of Beloved.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey in the 1998 film adaptation of Beloved.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strange, surreal events proliferate in her books: there are ghosts and voodoo dolls, people falling out of windows, bags of bones dangling from the ceiling. Girls think that if the marigold seeds they plant actually bloom, a friend\u2019s baby will be born safely (<em>The Bluest Eye</em>). An insurance agent leaps off the roof of a hospital in a crazed attempt to fly (<em>Song of Solomon</em>). Such fantastical developments are taken for granted by Morrison\u2019s people. Given the cruelties of history they have experienced firsthand \u2013 bodies hanging from trees, 46 men chained together in the blazing Georgia sun \u2013 the bizarre and monstrous no longer surprise them. It\u2019s the ordinary that too often seems out of reach.</p> <p>In <em>Home</em>, a man named Frank remembers how his family was run out of their home in Texas: \u201cYou could be inside, living in your own house for years, and still, men with or without badges but always with guns could force you, your family, your neighbors to pack up and move \u2013 with or without shoes.\u201d Residents were told 24 hours or else \u2013 \u201c\u2018else\u2019 meaning \u2018die\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>This awareness of the precariousness of life haunts Morrison\u2019s people. Some feel trapped in a deadening struggle for survival, so beaten down by grief or misfortune that they become resigned to a life in which \u201cthere was no future, just long stretches of killing time\u201d. Others, driven by an avidity for adventure, set off on journeys, in search of identities they can call their own.</p> <p>Many of these individuals are orphans, literally or metaphorically: people who have experienced abandonment as children or as spurned romantic partners. In the words of the heroine of <em>A Mercy</em>, they feel themselves to be ice floes, \u201ccut away from the riverbank\u201d, and they yearn to find something to belong to. At the same time, the hurt they\u2019ve experienced in the past makes them wary of caring too much. After all, loss and leaving are all too likely to result: parents die, children grow up, lovers move on, land is sold or stolen, people are killed or jailed. But if this is one of the lessons that Morrison\u2019s characters learn, another realisation \u2013 afforded the luckier ones \u2013 is that the past must sometimes be left behind, that redemption is to be found not in obsessively remembering, but in forgetting, if not forgiving.</p> <p>\u201cWanna fly,\u201d the hero\u2019s best friend says in <em>Song of Solomon</em>, \u201cyou got to give up the shit that weighs you down.\u201d Indeed transcendence always remains a possibility for the women and men in Morrison\u2019s novels \u2013 whether it\u2019s coming to appreciate \u201cthe music the world makes\u201d or finding love, in the words of a character in <em>Beloved</em>, with someone who takes \u201cthe pieces I am\u201d and gives them \u201cback to me in all the right order\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Michiko Kakutani is the author of </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/death-of-truth-616768.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Death of Truth</em></a><em>.

Violent, heart-wrenching events occur in her fiction: a runaway slave named Sethe cuts the throat of her baby daughter with a handsaw to spare her the fate she suffered herself as a slave (Beloved); a cosmetics salesman hunts down his lover and shoots her dead (Jazz); a woman pours kerosene on her drug-addicted son and sets him on fire (Sula). Such horrifying events are acts of desperation that can be comprehended only in the context of the earlier tragedies these characters or their families have suffered. In fact, if there is one insistent theme in Morrison\u2019s novels, it\u2019s the ways in which the past inexorably shapes the present, erasing innocence, cutting off options of escape, and warping relationships between women and men, parents and children. As in William Faulkner\u2019s work, the past is never dead for Morrison\u2019s people \u2013 it\u2019s not even past. Faulkner was clearly an influence on Morrison\u2019s writing, as were Ralph Ellison, Virginia Woolf, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and African American folklore. But Morrison forged from such disparate sources a voice that was all her own \u2013 fierce, poetic and Proustian in its ability to fuse time present and time past. Her 1987 masterpiece Beloved created a harrowing portrait of slavery that possesses all the resonance of a classical myth, while remaining grounded in the awful particulars of American history. Song of Solomon stands as a quintessential bildungsroman \u2013 the story of one man\u2019s coming of age and rebirth, recounted in a narrative that spans allegory, realism and fable. And novels such as The Bluest Eye and Sula attest that Morrison was equally at home chronicling small-town life in the mid-20th century, with its insular dynamics and slowly shifting mores. Strange, surreal events proliferate in her books: there are ghosts and voodoo dolls, people falling out of windows, bags of bones dangling from the ceiling. Girls think that if the marigold seeds they plant actually bloom, a friend\u2019s baby will be born safely (The Bluest Eye). An insurance agent leaps off the roof of a hospital in a crazed attempt to fly (Song of Solomon). Such fantastical developments are taken for granted by Morrison\u2019s people. Given the cruelties of history they have experienced firsthand \u2013 bodies hanging from trees, 46 men chained together in the blazing Georgia sun \u2013 the bizarre and monstrous no longer surprise them. It\u2019s the ordinary that too often seems out of reach. In Home, a man named Frank remembers how his family was run out of their home in Texas: \u201cYou could be inside, living in your own house for years, and still, men with or without badges but always with guns could force you, your family, your neighbors to pack up and move \u2013 with or without shoes.\u201d Residents were told 24 hours or else \u2013 \u201c\u2018else\u2019 meaning \u2018die\u2019\u201d. This awareness of the precariousness of life haunts Morrison\u2019s people. Some feel trapped in a deadening struggle for survival, so beaten down by grief or misfortune that they become resigned to a life in which \u201cthere was no future, just long stretches of killing time\u201d. Others, driven by an avidity for adventure, set off on journeys, in search of identities they can call their own. Many of these individuals are orphans, literally or metaphorically: people who have experienced abandonment as children or as spurned romantic partners. In the words of the heroine of A Mercy, they feel themselves to be ice floes, \u201ccut away from the riverbank\u201d, and they yearn to find something to belong to. At the same time, the hurt they\u2019ve experienced in the past makes them wary of caring too much. After all, loss and leaving are all too likely to result: parents die, children grow up, lovers move on, land is sold or stolen, people are killed or jailed. But if this is one of the lessons that Morrison\u2019s characters learn, another realisation \u2013 afforded the luckier ones \u2013 is that the past must sometimes be left behind, that redemption is to be found not in obsessively remembering, but in forgetting, if not forgiving. \u201cWanna fly,\u201d the hero\u2019s best friend says in Song of Solomon, \u201cyou got to give up the shit that weighs you down.\u201d Indeed transcendence always remains a possibility for the women and men in Morrison\u2019s novels \u2013 whether it\u2019s coming to appreciate \u201cthe music the world makes\u201d or finding love, in the words of a character in Beloved, with someone who takes \u201cthe pieces I am\u201d and gives them \u201cback to me in all the right order\u201d. \u2022 Michiko Kakutani is the author of The Death of Truth. The paperback edition will be released on 22 August.",

      "bodyText": "John McDonnell has doubled down on his pledge that Labour would reject a government of national unity and instead would push for Jeremy Corbyn to form a government or for a general election, in a move that appeared to stymie plans being prepared by Tory rebels. McDonnell told audience at an Edinburgh festival fringe event that it would be unsustainable for Boris Johnson to remain as prime minister if he no longer had a Commons majority. The shadow chancellor said that if the Conservative leader failed to quit he would not \u201cwant to drag the Queen into this but [he] would be sending Jeremy Corbyn in a cab to Buckingham Palace to say \u2018we\u2019re taking over\u2019\u201d. McDonnell said he expected Labour to win that confidence vote, and said Labour would try to force Johnson out by attempting to form a caretaker government with the support of other opposition parties and rebel Conservative MPs. Ruling out any deals with the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish National party, McDonnell said the only guarantee to other opposition parties would be to block a no-deal Brexit and organise a fresh EU referendum. \u201cAgain that no means no coalitions or pacts, we just put it there [and] I think people of goodwill who are concerned about the interests of this country, about avoiding a no-deal Brexit, will vote for it,\u201d he said. McDonnell also rejected claims over the weekend by Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, that it was solely in the prime minister\u2019s gift to decide whether and when to hold a general election. Johnson\u2019s allies have suggested he would delay that election until after he had forced through a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. \u201cWe then have two weeks in which the existing prime minister or anybody else can determine whether they can secure a majority in parliament for a government,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019ll be saying Labour can form a majority government and we expect others to come behind us to do that, so it becomes a caretaker government. And part of that will be to say: yes, we will block a no deal and go back to the country in a referendum. \u201cSo that\u2019s the choice that other parties and other MPs will have. Will they support Labour going into government under Jeremy Corbyn to prevent a no deal. I think there will be a majority government.\u201d If Johnson refused to quit and Labour was unable to form that caretaker government, there could then be a second no confidence motion 14 days after the first where Labour would try to force a general election, McDonnell added. \u201cThen if necessary there\u2019s a second no-confidence motion if we have to use it. Cummings got it wrong, and other commentators have made it clear, actually that second no-confidence motion will be the one which if necessary we will use to force a general election. No prime minister can sustain themselves in office when they no longer have a majority in the House of Commons.\u201d Both McDonnell, and the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said on Tuesday night they would reject any opportunity to form a cross-party unity government led by anyone other than Corbyn. Long-Bailey told Channel 4 News the party \u201cwouldn\u2019t countenance a national government of unity\u201d to deal with Brexit. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is a national unity government that gives Boris some sort of get out of jail free card,\u201d she said. Several Labour MPs made clear overnight they would be prepared to join cross-party efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThe damage caused by this reckless hard Brexit will be felt for generations, it goes beyond party politics,\u201d the Cardiff North MP, Anna McMorrin, tweeted. \u201cI will work with any MP from any party to stop no deal, bring about a public vote and campaign for remain.\u201d McDonnell also caused friction with Scottish Labour on Tuesday during his interview in Edinburgh by appearing to cautiously back the prospect of a second independence referendum, comments that have fuelled speculation Labour would hope to broker a pact with the SNP. Asked about a future referendum, McDonnell said: \u201cWe would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That\u2019s democracy.\u201d McDonnell admitted Labour was split on the issue, but implied the UK leadership agreed. \u201cThere are other views within the party, but that\u2019s our view,\u201d he said. His remarks, which followed a poll on Monday showing 52% of Scottish voters backed independence, contradict Scottish Labour policy and the formal position of the UK party not to support another plebiscite on independence.",

      "bodyText": "Law enforcement groups, including the FBI, have been monitoring opponents of a natural gas infrastructure project in Oregon and circulated intelligence to an email list that included a Republican-aligned anti-environmental PR operative, emails obtained by the Guardian show. The South Western Oregon Joint Task Force (SWOJTF) and its members were monitoring opponents of the Jordan Cove energy project, a proposal by the Canadian energy company Pembina to build the first-ever liquefied natural gas export terminal on the US west coast, as well as a new 232-mile pipeline that would carry fracked natural gas to the port of Coos Bay. The Trump administration has named Jordan Cove as one of its highest-priority infrastructure projects. Jordan Cove opponents have raised concerns about the project\u2019s significant environmental impacts, impacts on public lands, indigenous rights and climate change. The emails, obtained via open records requests, reflect the increased scrutiny and surveillance to which law enforcement agencies are often subjecting indigenous and environmental groups, activists say. It also comes amid an uptick in civil disobedience and direct actions challenging fossil fuel infrastructure projects \u2013 particularly in the wake of the Native American-led struggle against the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016 and 2017. They also reflect a nationwide tendency for rightwing partisans, law enforcement agencies and the fossil fuel industry to ally with one another in the suppression of such activities. An email distribution list associated with the taskforce included addressees in the FBI, the Bureau of Land Management, the Department of Justice (DoJ), the National Forest Service (NFS), Oregon state police (OSP), and various Oregon municipal police and sheriffs departments. But some of its recipients are outside any government agency, most notably Mark Pfeifle, the CEO of the political consultancy Off The Record Strategies. Pfeifle was previously a Bush administration PR adviser on national security. More recently, Pfeifle worked with law enforcement on a counter-information operation against the Dakota Access Pipeline protesters. When contacted by telephone about the Jordan Cove project, Mr Pfeifle said \u201cI just don\u2019t have anything for you, I\u2019m not up on it,\u201d before ending the conversation. Emails circulated on the SWOJTF email list include activists\u2019 social media posts, emails and rally announcements. Pfeifle appeared on the distribution list of a November 2018 email from the list\u2019s apparent keeper, the Coos county deputy sheriff, Bryan Valencia, which described a recent protest action by Southern Oregon Rising Tide, a direct action climate justice group. \u201cThese are the tactics that are currently being used to forcibly insert their narrative into the conversation,\u201d Valencia wrote.

      "body": "<p> There comes a time in any critic\u2019s life when you have to suppress whatever footling objections you have had, and salute the Kevin Costneraissance. You have to bow down to the pure demonic inspiration of creating a sentimental live-action family film about a lovable golden retriever, whose grouchy inner monologue is voiced by none other than Kevin Costner. You have to put your hands up and say: I get it. The dog looks adorable, intelligent and sad-eyed, and just as owners look like their pets, so dogs in weepie movies based on runaway New York Times bestselling books start to look like the veteran ex-romantic leads doing the voice \u2013 ie Kevin Costner. The morphing process is inexorable and by the closing credits, it\u2019s basically Kevin Goldenretrievster we\u2019re talking about, without CGI or the pointy ears that Judi Dench has to wear in Cats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/pick-of-the-litter-review-dog-documentary-guide-dogs\">Pick of the Litter review \u2013 heartwarming dogumentary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Screenwriter Mark Bomback has adapted the three-hankie property from author and movie producer Garth Stein, and Simon Curtis directs. They have created a film aimed with lethal efficiency at your tear ducts like Chuck Norris putting his boot into your kidneys. Milo Ventimiglia plays Denny, a race car driver renowned for an ability to handle his vehicle in the rain \u2013 and perhaps also for piloting his family\u2019s lives through a tear-fall of sadness. He\u2019s devoted to his dog, Enzo (Costner), who with decent canine stoicism accepts the loss of attention when Denny falls in love with Eve (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/13/amanda-seyfried-paid-10-percent-less-male-costar-hollywood\">Amanda Seyfried</a>) and then they have a baby. But a dark shadow falls when Eve begins to feel unwell. And who do you suppose is going to step up and keep the family together? The purely outrageous final scene addresses Enzo\u2019s own belief that dogs can evolve upwards into homo sapiens. His canine existence looks dignified enough to me. </p> <p>\u2022 The Art of Racing in the Rain is released in the UK and US on 9 August.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyL6Q0yGAKM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xyL6Q0yGAKM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2019.

      "bodyText": "There comes a time in any critic\u2019s life when you have to suppress whatever footling objections you have had, and salute the Kevin Costneraissance. You have to bow down to the pure demonic inspiration of creating a sentimental live-action family film about a lovable golden retriever, whose grouchy inner monologue is voiced by none other than Kevin Costner. You have to put your hands up and say: I get it. The dog looks adorable, intelligent and sad-eyed, and just as owners look like their pets, so dogs in weepie movies based on runaway New York Times bestselling books start to look like the veteran ex-romantic leads doing the voice \u2013 ie Kevin Costner. The morphing process is inexorable and by the closing credits, it\u2019s basically Kevin Goldenretrievster we\u2019re talking about, without CGI or the pointy ears that Judi Dench has to wear in Cats. Screenwriter Mark Bomback has adapted the three-hankie property from author and movie producer Garth Stein, and Simon Curtis directs. They have created a film aimed with lethal efficiency at your tear ducts like Chuck Norris putting his boot into your kidneys. Milo Ventimiglia plays Denny, a race car driver renowned for an ability to handle his vehicle in the rain \u2013 and perhaps also for piloting his family\u2019s lives through a tear-fall of sadness. He\u2019s devoted to his dog, Enzo (Costner), who with decent canine stoicism accepts the loss of attention when Denny falls in love with Eve (Amanda Seyfried) and then they have a baby. But a dark shadow falls when Eve begins to feel unwell. And who do you suppose is going to step up and keep the family together? The purely outrageous final scene addresses Enzo\u2019s own belief that dogs can evolve upwards into homo sapiens. His canine existence looks dignified enough to me. \u2022 The Art of Racing in the Rain is released in the UK and US on 9 August. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2019. It stated previously that the release date in the UK and the US was 9 April, not 9 August.",

As such, the new Kindle Oasis has the same aluminium body, asymmetrical design, flush screen and page turn buttons as the previous version. It\u2019s actually 6g lighter than the old model, and 0.1mm thicker, not that you\u2019d notice.</p> <p>The buttons are just as responsive, and for many they will be the reason to buy it, as page-turn buttons are simply better than just a touchscreen when reading. The screen is also as good and responsive as e-ink displays currently get. The 7in display, about the size of a small paperback, is crisp and a delight to read. The 25-LED frontlight is even across the whole page with auto-brightness or manual control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dcf4de63ccf88d33103e8f4ee248f4b42d3923f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dcf4de63ccf88d33103e8f4ee248f4b42d3923f/198_275_4523_2714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Kindle Oasis 2019 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can manually adjust the colour temperature of the screen or set it to become warmer as the sun sets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The warm light function moves from brilliant white to a warm yellow over 24 gradations.

But some might prefer to have a warmer light all the time. Set to between 12 and 19 on the sliding scale, it matched the colour of a traditional paperback page, which is a game-changer for those looking to replicate the feeling of reading paper as much as possible.

It was just awful to be taken for a 15-year-old when you were knocking on the door of the legal drinking age. Then, suddenly, it\u2019s the other way round. I was 32 and about to become a father when another prospective father I was chatting to in the hospital took me for 25. I was thrilled, but knew then that the want-to-look-older phase of my life was gone, never to return.</p> <p>More shockingly, when I was in my 20s, my whole family was at a schoolfriend\u2019s wedding in Brighton. I was chatting to the new girlfriend of a mate of ours called Marcus. She didn\u2019t know many people there. Slightly running out of conversation, I asked her where Marcus was. \u201cHe\u2019s over there, chatting to some old guy,\u201d she said. I looked over and there was Marcus talking to my dad. My blood ran cold; Dad was indeed an old guy. I\u2019d never noticed before.</p> <p>And at this very moment, as I write this, my blood is running cold again, because I\u2019ve just worked out that my dad then was the same age that I am now.

Another ghastly rubicon crossed there; thanks for being with me at this traumatic moment.</p> <p>Oh yes, I nearly forgot \u2013 a man who I think looked not much younger than me stood up for me on the tube the other day. Nice gesture from the chap; I really wish he hadn\u2019t made it.</p> <p>And so on to last Saturday\u2019s kick in the Niagaras at the cricket. The first time I heard another real horror word in the advancing-years lexicon was seven years ago, when I was 45. I was consulting London\u2019s leading foot surgeon about a problem I had with my achilles tendon. He hailed from Swansea.

      "bodyText": "Authorities on a remote island in Japan where there are more cats than people appear close to solving the mystery behind a dramatic drop in its feline population. Animal welfare groups voiced concern that foul play was responsible after the number of cats on Umashima, an island of 30 people about 10km (six miles) off the south-western city of Kitakyushu, fell from 90 in 2014 to just 30 this year. Fears that the island\u2019s cats had been poisoned rose after residents found slices of fish laced with a mysterious blue substance in multiple locations, including agricultural land, and said they had seen several stray cats in physical distress. In recent years, once-healthy cats were seen foaming at the mouth and collapsing, while in 2017, five animals were found dead or close to death near the island\u2019s harbour, the Mainichi Shimbun reported. Umashima has always been home to a large feline population, although it is less well known than Aoshima, an island in Ehime prefecture whose 100-plus cats outnumber human residents by a ratio of six to one. In 2014, a local animal welfare group neutered 79 of the 90 cats on Umashima amid complaints about the smell and the nuisance created by the growing feline population. That, however, did not explain the sharp fall in the cat population, according to Kunihisa Sagami, director of the foundation that neutered the cats. \u201cIt\u2019s not a normal decrease, and there\u2019s no doubt that an outside, human element, such as animal cruelty, is causing it,\u201d he told the Mainichi. Days after the deaths drew media interest, a Japanese TV network this week appeared to have solved the mystery, interviewing a local man who said he had placed fish laced with an agricultural chemical in his fields to stop crows eating his potato crops. \u201cIt was never my intention to harm any cats,\u201d he told the local RKB News channel. Sachie Yamazaki, a member of Scat, a local nonprofit group that campaigns against cruelty to animals, said police were analysing samples of the fish to see if it contained poison. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many crows on Umashima, and the food found in fields was clearly intended for cats,\u201d Yamazaki, who visited the island last week, told the Guardian. Animal welfare activists reportedly considered evacuating the remaining cats until their safety can be guaranteed, while local people voiced anger over the possibility that the cats had been harmed deliberately. \u201cI feel angry and sad.

But an alternative prime minister might also come forward claiming the confidence of the Commons, which could oblige the Queen to sack Johnson and appoint the claimant as head of a new government. Amid swirling speculation over who might prevail in such a confrontation \u2013 and debate over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/could-the-queen-sack-boris-johnson-the-experts-are-divided\">whether the Queen would have to adjudicate</a> \u2013 rebel MPs are working on a plan to force parliament to sit through the autumn recess, giving them three weeks\u2019 more sitting time to somehow stop a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n<p>Dominic Grieve, the Tory MP and former attorney general, has said it would be unconstitutional for Johnson to defy any vote of no confidence and remain in Downing Street until after the Brexit deadline of 31 October. But Cummings, approached by Sky News outside his home on Tuesday, gave a rare public comment suggesting that parliament would be unable to thwart him and Johnson: \u201cI don\u2019t know very much about very much. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/dominic-cummings-takes-swipe-at-greive-over-confidence-vote-plan\">Mr Grieve \u2026 we\u2019ll see what he\u2019s right about</a>.\u201d Cummings preceded the remark by saying that he doesn\u2019t think of himself as arrogant.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Machete attack on policeman \u2013 </strong>A London police officer has been left in a critical condition overnight after being slashed with a machete by the driver of a van he stopped.

Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky were suspects in the killings of Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, American Chynna Deese, 24, and Canadian botanist Leonard Dyck, 64 \u2013 all of whose bodies were found beside a highway in British Columbia. A manhunt stretching across 3,000km and three weeks reached its conclusion near the banks of a Manitoba river when police discovered a battered boat, then belongings of the fugitives, then their bodies. The manner and time of their deaths has not been released. British Columbia\u2019s RCMP assistant commissioner Kevin Hackett said that until police sorted out what happened, \u201cwe will not conclude this file\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Thursday catch-up</strong></p> \n<p>&gt; Mark Acklom, 45, a lifelong con artist who became one of the UK\u2019s most wanted fugitives, has been given five years\u2019 jail for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/08/serial-con-artist-jailed-for-five-years-after-swindling-ex-girlfriend\">swindling his then-girlfriend out of \u00a3300,000</a> before disappearing.

Ministers are considering the Augar report into higher education and funding, which recommended tuition fees fall to a maximum of \u00a37,500 per year, from \u00a39,250 at present. The House of Lords science and technology committee said the recommendation should be implemented only if the government was prepared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/08/tuition-fees-cut-could-be-devastating-for-universities-say-peers\">fully compensate universities</a> with additional teaching grants.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Not minted \u2013 </strong>The Royal Mint produced no 1p or 2p coins last year, for the first time in decades. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/07/royal-mint-paused-creation-of-1p-and-2p-coins-last-year\">No \u00a32 coins needed to be made either</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: MPs challenge Cummings plan to ignore parliament Hello \u2013 it\u2019s Warren Murray bringing you the stories to carry you forward into the day. Parliament will not be made an irrelevance by a \u201cmaverick populist who spouts off to his blogger friends\u201d (that being Dominic Cummings), says Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle, one of the MPs determined that Boris Johnson and his top adviser must not succeed in any plan to push through a no-deal Brexit against the will of parliament. The fixed-term parliaments act means Johnson would not have to resign immediately upon losing a confidence vote, and could drag things out past 31 October allowing a hard Brexit to take place before any election. But an alternative prime minister might also come forward claiming the confidence of the Commons, which could oblige the Queen to sack Johnson and appoint the claimant as head of a new government. Amid swirling speculation over who might prevail in such a confrontation \u2013 and debate over whether the Queen would have to adjudicate \u2013 rebel MPs are working on a plan to force parliament to sit through the autumn recess, giving them three weeks\u2019 more sitting time to somehow stop a no-deal Brexit. Dominic Grieve, the Tory MP and former attorney general, has said it would be unconstitutional for Johnson to defy any vote of no confidence and remain in Downing Street until after the Brexit deadline of 31 October. But Cummings, approached by Sky News outside his home on Tuesday, gave a rare public comment suggesting that parliament would be unable to thwart him and Johnson: \u201cI don\u2019t know very much about very much. Mr Grieve \u2026 we\u2019ll see what he\u2019s right about.\u201d Cummings preceded the remark by saying that he doesn\u2019t think of himself as arrogant. * * * Machete attack on policeman \u2013 A London police officer has been left in a critical condition overnight after being slashed with a machete by the driver of a van he stopped. The attack took place in Leyton. The policeman managed to use his Taser despite having been stabbed, and the suspect was then arrested by another officer. The injured officer, in his 30s, was taken to hospital by ambulance. * * * Canada murder suspects dead \u2013 The bodies have been found, police say, of two teenagers wanted in Canada for triple murder. Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky were suspects in the killings of Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, American Chynna Deese, 24, and Canadian botanist Leonard Dyck, 64 \u2013 all of whose bodies were found beside a highway in British Columbia. A manhunt stretching across 3,000km and three weeks reached its conclusion near the banks of a Manitoba river when police discovered a battered boat, then belongings of the fugitives, then their bodies. The manner and time of their deaths has not been released. British Columbia\u2019s RCMP assistant commissioner Kevin Hackett said that until police sorted out what happened, \u201cwe will not conclude this file\u201d. * * * Thursday catch-up &gt; Mark Acklom, 45, a lifelong con artist who became one of the UK\u2019s most wanted fugitives, has been given five years\u2019 jail for swindling his then-girlfriend out of \u00a3300,000 before disappearing. He was caught in Switzerland and extradited. &gt; Almost 67,000 new cases of asthma in children across 18 European countries could be prevented every year if levels of tiny particulates polluting the air are cut to those recommended by the World Health Organization, experts have determined. &gt; Puerto Rico has its third governor in less than a week. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 resigned in disgrace last Friday, handing the reins to Pedro Pierluisi, who was then deemed ineligible by the high court. Wanda V\u00e1zquez has now been sworn in. &gt; The family of Nora Quoirin, 15, is continuing its appeal for help to find the London girl who went missing from a Malaysian resort. Police say they have not ruled out foul play in the disappearance of Quoirin, who has learning and developmental disabilities. &gt; Boris Johnson has pledged \u00a3250m for artificial intelligence research at the National Health Service to predict who might get sick, from what, and when. Pricey IT projects are a touchy subject at the NHS \u2013 remember \u201cConnecting for Health\u201d? &gt; Packaged cocaine worth \u00a32m has washed up on a beach in New Zealand and police have asked local people to hand in any more they find. * * * \u2018Trump has no place here\u2019 \u2013 Donald Trump was greeted by protests in El Paso when he visited the site of one of the weekend\u2019s mass shootings, which have been partly blamed on the racially-charged language he has fostered in American politics. In a direct counter to Trump\u2019s visit, the Democratic presidential candidate and El Paso native Beto O\u2019Rourke gave a speech declaring that Trump \u201chas no place here \u2026 He\u2019s helped to create what we saw in El Paso on Saturday\u201d. Trump and first lady, Melania arrived in El Paso from Dayton, Ohio, where they had visited some of those who were injured in Sunday\u2019s attack in that city. Trump did not have any public events scheduled in either city \u2013 aides said he would meet privately with victims, their families, first responders and hospital staff. Trump said it had been an \u201camazing day\u201d and told members of the press: \u201cI wish you could have been there to see it.\u201d The media were not allowed to join his hospital visits. * * * Warning over uni fees \u2013 Cutting tuition fees for students in England would have severe consequences for universities already struggling financially, a Lords committee has said. Ministers are considering the Augar report into higher education and funding, which recommended tuition fees fall to a maximum of \u00a37,500 per year, from \u00a39,250 at present. The House of Lords science and technology committee said the recommendation should be implemented only if the government was prepared to fully compensate universities with additional teaching grants. * * * Not minted \u2013 The Royal Mint produced no 1p or 2p coins last year, for the first time in decades. No \u00a32 coins needed to be made either. The future of copper coins has been debated; the Treasury says 60% of them are squirrelled away by people after being used for only one transaction, but the government has said it has no plans to phase out any denominations of UK currency. About 2.2 million people in the UK are estimated to be almost entirely reliant on cash on a daily basis, especially the elderly and those in rural communities.

I admired the breathtaking views of the bright-green rice paddies, limestone cliffs, enchanting caves and the beautiful river. Tam C\u1ed1c is a magical place, full of natural wonders. But I was slightly surprised by the rowing technique. The people in Tam C\u1ed1c row with their feet! It is apparently a faster way of rowing, and more energy-efficient. It also bodes well for multitasking \u2013 I saw one local woman going past, rowing with her feet, phone in one hand and eating mango from the other.<br><strong>Rebecca</strong></p> \n<h2>A feast in immigration, Canada</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de4ac727e76a357a2f90e0c30080111e8eea5be5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de4ac727e76a357a2f90e0c30080111e8eea5be5/226_0_2948_1769/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunrise over Toronto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunrise over Toronto.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Howard Yang/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I was heading to Canada.

Our wedding anniversary evening was delightful: a lovely dinner with views of a spectacular lightning storm over the Pyrenees. Eventually, the heavy but warm rain arrived as we walked back to the hotel. At the bridge we had parked the car beneath, I was a little concerned that what had been dry road was now dark water flowing very quickly out to sea. Our car didn\u2019t seem to be at any risk, and there were others, so I decided not to move it. A couple of hours later we watched our car and another float gently out to sea!

In one taxi near the town of Vi\u00f1ales, our driver told us he was a doctor but because \u201ceveryone is a doctor\u201d in Cuba, he was moonlighting to earn extra money. We were initially unsure whether to believe him. But then we passed a motorbike that had hit a pothole and crashed.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Footloose in Vietnam I hopped on to a pink rowing boat in the village of Tam C\u1ed1c in Vietnam, for a peaceful boat ride just after sunrise. I admired the breathtaking views of the bright-green rice paddies, limestone cliffs, enchanting caves and the beautiful river. Tam C\u1ed1c is a magical place, full of natural wonders. But I was slightly surprised by the rowing technique. The people in Tam C\u1ed1c row with their feet! It is apparently a faster way of rowing, and more energy-efficient. It also bodes well for multitasking \u2013 I saw one local woman going past, rowing with her feet, phone in one hand and eating mango from the other. Rebecca A feast in immigration, Canada I was heading to Canada. This was to be a summer of firsts \u2013 flying, drive-in movies, outdoor pools \u2026 But because I\u2019d taken \u201cplace of birth\u201d literally when filling in my landing card, I\u2019d listed the hospital instead of the town, and on arrival at Toronto airport I was ushered into a room for further processing. I sat next to a young man who\u2019d arrived from Naples to whom officials were explaining that despite the fact that his mum had made it, the huge tinfoil-wrapped parcel he was holding was not allowed to leave the airport. Dejected, he unwrapped it \u2013 and that\u2019s how my first meal in Canada came to be a deliciously herby roast chicken eaten with my hands, in the company of a sad stranger in a grey office. Paul Lost cow, Ladakh, India My husband and I went on a volunteer project on a farm near a beautiful village in the Himalayas. Once they let us take a cow out to pasture (normally the young boys took the many cows up on to the higher hills). We led one cow out but managed to lose it. When we came back to the house ready to solemnly inform them we had lost her, there she was standing right where we started. The whole village thought this was hilarious. Giannina Bug\u2019s life, Nicaragua Day 16 of our three-week World Challenge school expedition to Nicaragua. After a six-hour bus journey to a rural school in Le\u00f3n, where we\u2019d be helping to build a school kitchen, we laid out our sleeping bags on a classroom floor. As the sun began to set the only source of light we had was a few torches. What a mistake! Hundreds of flying cockroaches were awoken, filling the air. From every direction cockroaches were landing on us as we rummaged in our backpacks to find our mosquito nets as quickly as we could. My laughter was infused with panic. The following nights saw us tightly wrapped in our mosquito nets, flinching at the sound of any buzzing passer-by. Lucy Lennard Au revoir aux voitures, France Beware signs saying \u201cLit d\u2019inondation\u201d (prone to flooding)! We didn\u2019t and watched our hire car float out to sea in Collioure, on the Mediterranean. Our wedding anniversary evening was delightful: a lovely dinner with views of a spectacular lightning storm over the Pyrenees. Eventually, the heavy but warm rain arrived as we walked back to the hotel. At the bridge we had parked the car beneath, I was a little concerned that what had been dry road was now dark water flowing very quickly out to sea. Our car didn\u2019t seem to be at any risk, and there were others, so I decided not to move it. A couple of hours later we watched our car and another float gently out to sea!

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of people have staged a \u201claser show\u201d in Hong Kong to protest against the arrest of a student union leader who bought a bag of laser pointers for possessing an offensive weapon. Police had sought to justify the arrest of Keith Fong, head of the Baptist University student union, by showing how one of the lasers could burn through newspaper. On Wednesday night, protesters gathered at the Space Museum\u2019s planetarium and pretended to set the building and trees outside on fire using the lasers. They chanted \u201cfire, fire, not on fire\u201d, as they pointed dozens of laser beams at the outside wall of the building. In a trolling homage to Tuesday\u2019s arrest, protesters also held up a pro-Beijing newspaper, pointing dozens of laser beams at it in an attempt to set it on fire, without success. Police say the lasers, which protesters have been directing at their eyes and at cameras, are dangerous \u201coffensive weapons\u201d. The gathering later evolved into a party and carnival with singing, dancing, and hand-shadow puppet shows projected on to the side of the planetarium, a far cry from the tense atmosphere of the recent mass protests against the increasing encroachment of Beijing on the city\u2019s freedoms. Soon, footage emerged of the night\u2019s festivities to background music from Star Wars, creating a montage that made it look as though the protesters were rebel fighters shooting down the airships of the evil empire. \u201cTonight was something we all needed: no tears, no blood, just laughter, song, and dance. I\u2019ll be revisiting this thread next time I come home with the smell of tear gas still clinging to me and screams ringing in my ears. This is the city we love. This is why we do it,\u201d writer Ryan Ho Kilpatrick tweeted. It was a sentiment being shared by people across social media as Hong Kong took a much-needed breather from the tense scenes that have gripped the city in recent weeks after a total of almost 2000 rounds of teargas were fired at protesters during clashes with police. The city is facing its worst political crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and the escalating and increasingly more unpredictable protests have prompted countries including the UK, Ireland, Australia, Japan and now the United States to issue travel alerts. The protests began in opposition to a now-suspended extradition law, which would have allowed suspects to be tried in mainland Chinese courts. They have now broadened into a backlash against the government of the Asian financial hub, fuelled by many residents\u2019 fears of eroding freedoms under the tightening control of China\u2019s Communist party leaders in Beijing. Across the border in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, government officials have been discussing the political crisis. Zhang Xiaoming, one of Beijing\u2019s top officials in charge of Hong Kong and Macau affairs, said it was a \u201cpressing and overriding task\u201d to \u201cprevent Hong Kong from sinking into an abyss\u201d, the South China Morning Post reported. The director of the state council\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau affairs office warned that if the protests escalated beyond the Hong Kong government\u2019s control the Chinese army could be deployed to restore law and order. Zhang said bowing to protesters\u2019 demands would not resolve the crisis. However, he left open the possibility of the Hong Kong government setting up a commission of inquiry into the extradition bill saga once order had been restored.

People, most of them Americans, some in tears, were offering donations to rebuild the beloved gothic monument.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot imagine a world without Paris, and we cannot imagine a Paris without Notre-Dame,\u201d the French Heritage Society had said in its call for funds. It was right.</p> <p>The French Heritage Society has so far received $2.45m in donations, mostly from the US (including $2m from the Est\u00e9e Lauder estate), and the funds keep coming. Donations also suddenly poured into the American charity Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, established in 2017 to gather funds for the monument\u2019s restoration. From 800 donors who had donated $2m before the fire, the figures jumped to 10,000, who gave an additional $6m, its president, Michel Picaud, said.

      "bodyText": "As news broke on 15 April 2019 that the roof of the French cathedral Notre-Dame de Paris was on fire, phones immediately started ringing at the offices of the French Heritage Society, executive director Jennifer Herlein recalls. People, most of them Americans, some in tears, were offering donations to rebuild the beloved gothic monument. \u201cWe cannot imagine a world without Paris, and we cannot imagine a Paris without Notre-Dame,\u201d the French Heritage Society had said in its call for funds. It was right. The French Heritage Society has so far received $2.45m in donations, mostly from the US (including $2m from the Est\u00e9e Lauder estate), and the funds keep coming. Donations also suddenly poured into the American charity Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, established in 2017 to gather funds for the monument\u2019s restoration. From 800 donors who had donated $2m before the fire, the figures jumped to 10,000, who gave an additional $6m, its president, Michel Picaud, said. For both charities, 95% of the donations came from the US. Notre-Dame embodies millennia of French history, art and architecture. When it was almost lost to flames, France held its breath in horror \u2013 but why was this wave of grief felt so gravely across the Atlantic, too? American citizens agreed: with their donations, many sent heartfelt, personal notes. \u201cMy 99 year old mother asked me to send this donation to the Notre-Dame Fire Restoration Fund.

Law and music went by the wayside, while acting and life-long relationships with Walsh and McGuinness were set in motion. \u201cI remember the confidence of youth that you have. You\u2019re just going to go for it and when you\u2019re 19 or 20 nothing seems permanent.

Photograph: David James<br></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David James/film still handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There has been a natural flow to Murphy\u2019s career too. After getting the role in Disco Pigs, he toured with it worldwide for two years and starred in the film version. That led to being cast in Danny Boyle\u2019s zombie hit 28 Days Later in 2002, before Murphy started a director-actor relationship with Christopher Nolan, who cast him as Christian Bale\u2019s psychotic nemesis, the Scarecrow, in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jun/17/1\" title=\"\">Batman trilogy</a>, and brought him in for Dunkirk, where he played a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UPG0jlfpQk\" title=\"\">shell-shocked soldier</a>, desperately looking for a way out. But Blinders has had a cultural impact that goes beyond any of those projects. For Murphy, that influence can be measured on the high street. \u201cWhen something has an influence on fashion, that\u2019s the most visual message you get back that there\u2019s an impact,\u201d says Murphy. So what does he think of the sartorial style? \u201cEvery man looks good in a three-piece suit \u2026 it\u2019s far better than a shell suit.\u201d</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s not all suits and haircuts. Peaky Blinders is after all about gangsters \u2013 incredibly violent ones. For a show that\u2019s as bellicose as it is Brummie, there has understandably been strong criticism of its on-screen aggression. In the first series there is a prolonged gang scrap that is drenched in blood. The male characters usually deal with their post-trenches PTSD (many of them have fought in the first world war) in one of three ways: fighting, paying for sex or drinking. Female characters are often strong and defiant \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIOlWirdZC8\" title=\"\">Helen McCrory\u2019s Polly</a> \u2013 but when Tommy steps on the toes of a London rival in the second season, his sister is threatened with rape. That kind of writing has led some academics to claim it uses psychological trauma as a way to justify the glorification of some elements of <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/tv/peaky-blinders-glorifies-violence-toxic-masculinity-say-academics-2473859\" title=\"\">British lad culture</a> and even nationalism. <a href=\"https://mediaarts.unt.edu/content/george-sandra-larke-walsh\" title=\"\">George Sandra Larke-Walsh</a>, of the University of North Texas, argues that \u201cin the current socio-political environment, and associated concerns about the prevalence of toxic masculinity, such presentations no longer feel safely confined to fantasy.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCdRFMp8Xwo\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eCdRFMp8Xwo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>What does its star think of it all? \u201cWell, I\u2019m not British, first of all,\u201d says Murphy, shifting tone and shutting down. Of course not, but as the star of Peaky Blinders, does he think the show goes too far? \u201cEveryone is entitled to their own opinion. If people want to read it that way, fine. Steven [Knight] is a better man to answer that.\u201d Sophie Rundle, Joe Cole, Sam Neill, Tom Hardy and Adrien Brody all gave the show a prestige feel, but there\u2019s no doubt that this is Murphy\u2019s vehicle. Besides, Murphy is a producer on the show now; it\u2019s natural to expect him to have an informed opinion. \u201cIn my own reading of PTSD \u2013 it was never an excuse to behave aggressively, it manifests in many different ways,\u201d he says, getting more animated.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe anything should be gratuitous. We\u2019ve always talked about there being consequences of violence \u2013 I hope that it is made to look ugly and makes you flinch or turn away. We are working within the limitations of the gangster genre and things are heightened, and that is part of its appeal, so I suppose it\u2019s balancing that. You see the psychological trauma that Tommy suffers throughout the new series, particularly.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bd511e978fd2221c9efc7a2294772476829067b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bd511e978fd2221c9efc7a2294772476829067b/0_0_2301_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Murphy in the film version of Disco Pigs, 2001.

The fifth season sees the Shelbys coming to terms with a rising tide of fascism around Europe in the buildup to the second world war; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/oswald-mosley\" title=\"\">Oswald Mosley</a> is in the ascendant. Murphy says it\u2019s a response to the current rising tide of populism around the world. \u201cWithout a doubt. You can find Mosley\u2019s speeches online. It\u2019s the playbook for populism: make Britain great again, he says that. False news etc. He was a fascinating challenge for Tommy, because he sees that it\u2019s starting all over again, in terms of world conflict.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a1d2d12c-ae47-4fc3-9ff1-8a9633f2f40c\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Series 5</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/25/peaky-blinders-recap-series-five-episode-one-truly-worth-the-wait\">Episode 1: Black Tuesday</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/26/peaky-blinders-recap-series-five-episode-two-the-shelbys-face-a-brutal-new-foe\">Episode 2: Black Cats</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Series 4</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/nov/15/peaky-blinders-recap-series-four-episode-one-the-noose\">Episode 1: The Noose</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/22/peaky-blinders-recap-series-four-episode-two-heathens\">Episode 2: Heathens</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/29/peaky-blinders-recap-series-4-episode-3-blackbird\">Episode 3: Blackbird</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/07/peaky-blinders-recap-series-4-episode-4-dangerous\">Episode 4: Dangerous</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/13/peaky-blinders-recap-series-4-episode-4-the-duel\">Episode 5: The Duel</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/20/peaky-blinders-recap-series-4-episode-6-the-company\">Episode 6: The Company</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Series 3</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/05/peaky-blinders-recap-series-three-episode-one-welcome-back-boys\">Episode 1</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/12/peaky-blinders-recap-series-three-episode-two-enter-paddy-considine-the-creep\">Episode 2</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/19/peaky-blinders-recap-series-three-episode-three-say-no-to-torture-tommy\">Episode 3</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/26/peaky-blinders-recap-series-three-episode-four-sickeningly-good\">Episode 4</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/02/peaky-blinders-recap-series-three-episode-five-of-course-there-was-a-candle-lit-orgy\">Episode 5</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/09/peaky-blinders-series-three-finale-recap-a-brilliant-bittersweet-nail-biter\">Episode 6</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Series 2</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/oct/02/peaky-blinders-recap-series-two-episode-one-style-swagger-and-a-violent-trip-to-london\">Episode 1</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/oct/09/peaky-blinders-recap-series-two-episode-two-tommy-shelby\">Episode 2</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/oct/16/peaky-blinders-recap-series-two-episode-three-a-strong-brutal-hour\">Episode 3</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/oct/23/peaky-blinders-recap-series-two-episode-four-sex-sabini-and-solomons\">Episode 4</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/oct/30/peaky-blinders-recap-series-two-episode-five-enthralling-yet-infuriating\">Episode 5</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/nov/06/peaky-blinders-recap-series-two-episode-six-what-a-finale\">Episode 6</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Series 1</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/12/peaky-blinders-recap-episode-one\">Episode 1</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/19/peaky-blinders-recap-episode-two\">Episode 2</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/26/peaky-blinders-racap-episode-three\">Episode 3</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/03/peaky-blinders-recap-episode-four\">Episode 4</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/10/peaky-blinders-recap-episode-five\">Episode 5</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/17/peaky-blinders-recap-episode-six\">Episode 6</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Does Murphy think a show like Peaky Blinders should have an underlying message?

It\u2019s hard to make a film about Brexit or about Trump because we\u2019re living it,\u201d says Murphy, who also starred in Ken Loach\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/jun/23/3\" title=\"\">The Wind That Shakes the Barley</a>, a film about the early IRA that was read by many as an indictment of US involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cIf you look at what happened with Mosley you can hold a mirror up to what is happening now and it\u2019s a more elegant way of doing it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"884f66c4c844cfa7cbf0246ceccd705828c9003c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/884f66c4c844cfa7cbf0246ceccd705828c9003c/0_0_6040_4027/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Murphy with P\u00e1draic Delaney in Ken Loach\u2019s 2006 The Wind That Shakes the Barley.

He recently filmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/21/anna-review-sasha-luss-luc-besson-empty-assassin-thriller\" title=\"\">Anna</a>, another assassin thriller directed by Luc Besson, who was accused of misconduct, rape and sexual assault by multiple women. The case has now been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/rape-inquiry-dropped-against-french-film-mogul-luc-besson\" title=\"\">dropped by French prosecutors</a>, but what did Murphy think when he heard the news? \u201cThe first I heard of it was a year after we had finished,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the film, I don\u2019t know anything about it. It\u2019s sad. You go into a project with all the best intentions and then that stuff comes out and you\u2019re shocked and saddened, and you just have to let it play out and be fully supportive of women and anyone who is in that situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Murphy has also been tipped as a potential new Bond, along with frontrunners James Norton and Richard Madden. \u201cThe thing about it is, if you say anything about Bond it becomes the headline, right?\u201d he says, not inaccurately. \u201cThere\u2019s two things I\u2019ll say about that. Firstly, there\u2019s a whole other industry which is completely separate from the film side of things, and that\u2019s the bookies. The second thing I\u2019d say is that I think it should be a woman, which rules me out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Murphy moved back to Ireland four years ago after 14 years in London. The move wasn\u2019t fuelled by Brexit, he says, but he is glad to be living in Dublin on a \u201cvery liberal island that is an outlier\u201d at the moment. When Brexit does come up, the anger is clear. \u201cThe Good Friday agreement was predicated on there not being a border and to think that you can hold Ireland to ransom, you can\u2019t \u2026\u201d Murphy tails off, then starts again. \u201cListen, if you and I are in a club and there are 28 members of the club and I decided to leave, why would I get preferential treatment? Doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d There\u2019s another brief pause. \u201cAnd if Ireland is a member of that club and me leaving undermines their whole set-up and the peace they have, it doesn\u2019t make any sense, and it\u2019s not equitable or fair and it\u2019s because the whole thing was sold on a bunch of misinformation.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95e573f51a38a7e38a9bf3bf3632c9e2e796ab04\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95e573f51a38a7e38a9bf3bf3632c9e2e796ab04/0_0_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Murphy in Anna, directed by Luc Besson.

There\u2019s no nuance, you can\u2019t put any of that into a referendum,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can say, \u2018yes, we\u2019ll leave the EU\u2019, but no one knew how.\u201d Get Murphy on a subject he is passionate about and you get a flash of Tommy Shelby. Not the searing menace or the much-copied haircut, but the more human side who justifies his actions for the welfare of his family. \u201cI really don\u2019t identify with him. He\u2019s a total stranger to me, but he\u2019s the only character I\u2019ve returned to in my career,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cHe is a relentless character \u2013 he never sleeps, he never eats \u2013 his ambition is limitless. So you need to be able to embody that.\u201d</p> \n<p>He says it takes him two months to \u201cshake off\u201d Tommy. His hair grows back, he goes away with his family and things slowly return to normal. But there is a price to be paid. \u201cAsk any actor \u2013 if you do something well there\u2019s inevitably some sort of exchange. It\u2019s not a methody thing, it\u2019s not a conscious thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI could never go on to another character \u2013 firstly, because you\u2019ve got that mad haircut, but because I need time to decompress because I\u2019m nothing like him. I\u2019m like his cowardly brother.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the summer of 1996, Cillian Murphy was at a crossroads. He had failed his law exams at University College Cork. He had turned down a three-album record contract with his Frank Zappa-influenced \u201cfunk-jam band\u201d, the Sons of Mr Green Genes. He had met his wife (the artist Yvonne McGuinness), and he had decided to audition for \u2013 and was cast in \u2013 Disco Pigs, a play about Cork teenagers by a then largely unknown writer called Enda Walsh. \u201cIt did feel kind of pivotal, and it wasn\u2019t just that summer \u2013 everything happened in the month of August,\u201d says Murphy. In the space of four weeks his life dramatically changed course. Law and music went by the wayside, while acting and life-long relationships with Walsh and McGuinness were set in motion. \u201cI remember the confidence of youth that you have. You\u2019re just going to go for it and when you\u2019re 19 or 20 nothing seems permanent. It was an adventure but, looking back, it does seem hugely formative.\u201d When I meet Murphy in the lounge of a Soho hotel his hair is well on the way towards shoulder length, and he has a short beard peppered with a few grey hairs \u2013 a byproduct of his role in another Walsh play, an adaptation of Max Porter\u2019s Grief Is the Thing With Feathers. Dressed in a pair of jeans and a bomber jacket, he looks like a quietly cool dad who has been sent out to fetch a complicated coffee order. So what does he think the earnest and ambitious 19-year-old Murphy would think of his career? \u201cI think he would be surprised \u2026 and probably a bit sad that the music thing didn\u2019t work out.\u201d Makers of flat caps and henley shirts everywhere will be thankful Murphy didn\u2019t choose the musical route. He is about to return to TV screens as Tommy Shelby, the patriarch and mob boss in the BBC\u2019s Birmingham-set gangster series Peaky Blinders, which is now in its fifth season and has become a bona fide pop culture phenomenon. Try to pick up a men\u2019s magazine and avoid its presence. You have probably noticed the rise in people wearing Blinders-esque three-piece suits. There are a video game and a film in the works, and, next month, a music festival. David Beckham started a clothing line inspired by its sartorial style; Arsenal\u2019s Basque coach Unai Emery watches it to improve his English, and it has the marker of any self-respecting cultural curio: its own dedicated podcast. Murphy was surprised by the success after taking the role, his first TV job in years. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand the title,\u201d he admits, but says he was impressed by Steven Knight\u2019s story, which was inspired by a real-life gang who had become a part of Brummie folklore. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if the second series would come, and it was the second one when it really started to become a bit zeitgeisty, but you never know. When something becomes successful you never know how or why \u2013 it\u2019s by osmosis.\u201d There has been a natural flow to Murphy\u2019s career too. After getting the role in Disco Pigs, he toured with it worldwide for two years and starred in the film version. That led to being cast in Danny Boyle\u2019s zombie hit 28 Days Later in 2002, before Murphy started a director-actor relationship with Christopher Nolan, who cast him as Christian Bale\u2019s psychotic nemesis, the Scarecrow, in his Batman trilogy, and brought him in for Dunkirk, where he played a shell-shocked soldier, desperately looking for a way out. But Blinders has had a cultural impact that goes beyond any of those projects. For Murphy, that influence can be measured on the high street. \u201cWhen something has an influence on fashion, that\u2019s the most visual message you get back that there\u2019s an impact,\u201d says Murphy. So what does he think of the sartorial style? \u201cEvery man looks good in a three-piece suit \u2026 it\u2019s far better than a shell suit.\u201d But it\u2019s not all suits and haircuts. Peaky Blinders is after all about gangsters \u2013 incredibly violent ones. For a show that\u2019s as bellicose as it is Brummie, there has understandably been strong criticism of its on-screen aggression. In the first series there is a prolonged gang scrap that is drenched in blood. The male characters usually deal with their post-trenches PTSD (many of them have fought in the first world war) in one of three ways: fighting, paying for sex or drinking. Female characters are often strong and defiant \u2013 such as Helen McCrory\u2019s Polly \u2013 but when Tommy steps on the toes of a London rival in the second season, his sister is threatened with rape. That kind of writing has led some academics to claim it uses psychological trauma as a way to justify the glorification of some elements of British lad culture and even nationalism. George Sandra Larke-Walsh, of the University of North Texas, argues that \u201cin the current socio-political environment, and associated concerns about the prevalence of toxic masculinity, such presentations no longer feel safely confined to fantasy.\u201d What does its star think of it all? \u201cWell, I\u2019m not British, first of all,\u201d says Murphy, shifting tone and shutting down. Of course not, but as the star of Peaky Blinders, does he think the show goes too far? \u201cEveryone is entitled to their own opinion. If people want to read it that way, fine. Steven [Knight] is a better man to answer that.\u201d Sophie Rundle, Joe Cole, Sam Neill, Tom Hardy and Adrien Brody all gave the show a prestige feel, but there\u2019s no doubt that this is Murphy\u2019s vehicle. Besides, Murphy is a producer on the show now; it\u2019s natural to expect him to have an informed opinion. \u201cIn my own reading of PTSD \u2013 it was never an excuse to behave aggressively, it manifests in many different ways,\u201d he says, getting more animated. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anything should be gratuitous. We\u2019ve always talked about there being consequences of violence \u2013 I hope that it is made to look ugly and makes you flinch or turn away. We are working within the limitations of the gangster genre and things are heightened, and that is part of its appeal, so I suppose it\u2019s balancing that. You see the psychological trauma that Tommy suffers throughout the new series, particularly.\u201d Perhaps the prickliness around the question of violence comes from what the show is trying to evolve into. The fifth season sees the Shelbys coming to terms with a rising tide of fascism around Europe in the buildup to the second world war; Oswald Mosley is in the ascendant. Murphy says it\u2019s a response to the current rising tide of populism around the world. \u201cWithout a doubt. You can find Mosley\u2019s speeches online. It\u2019s the playbook for populism: make Britain great again, he says that. False news etc. He was a fascinating challenge for Tommy, because he sees that it\u2019s starting all over again, in terms of world conflict.\u201d Does Murphy think a show like Peaky Blinders should have an underlying message? Should it comment on contemporary Britain? \u201cI think it\u2019s more powerful if you do it through the prism of history. It\u2019s hard to make a film about Brexit or about Trump because we\u2019re living it,\u201d says Murphy, who also starred in Ken Loach\u2019s The Wind That Shakes the Barley, a film about the early IRA that was read by many as an indictment of US involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cIf you look at what happened with Mosley you can hold a mirror up to what is happening now and it\u2019s a more elegant way of doing it.\u201d Murphy has had his own brush with a contemporary issue: the #MeToo movement. He recently filmed Anna, another assassin thriller directed by Luc Besson, who was accused of misconduct, rape and sexual assault by multiple women. The case has now been dropped by French prosecutors, but what did Murphy think when he heard the news? \u201cThe first I heard of it was a year after we had finished,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the film, I don\u2019t know anything about it. It\u2019s sad. You go into a project with all the best intentions and then that stuff comes out and you\u2019re shocked and saddened, and you just have to let it play out and be fully supportive of women and anyone who is in that situation.\u201d Murphy has also been tipped as a potential new Bond, along with frontrunners James Norton and Richard Madden. \u201cThe thing about it is, if you say anything about Bond it becomes the headline, right?\u201d he says, not inaccurately. \u201cThere\u2019s two things I\u2019ll say about that. Firstly, there\u2019s a whole other industry which is completely separate from the film side of things, and that\u2019s the bookies. The second thing I\u2019d say is that I think it should be a woman, which rules me out.\u201d Murphy moved back to Ireland four years ago after 14 years in London. The move wasn\u2019t fuelled by Brexit, he says, but he is glad to be living in Dublin on a \u201cvery liberal island that is an outlier\u201d at the moment. When Brexit does come up, the anger is clear. \u201cThe Good Friday agreement was predicated on there not being a border and to think that you can hold Ireland to ransom, you can\u2019t \u2026\u201d Murphy tails off, then starts again. \u201cListen, if you and I are in a club and there are 28 members of the club and I decided to leave, why would I get preferential treatment? Doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d There\u2019s another brief pause. \u201cAnd if Ireland is a member of that club and me leaving undermines their whole set-up and the peace they have, it doesn\u2019t make any sense, and it\u2019s not equitable or fair and it\u2019s because the whole thing was sold on a bunch of misinformation.\u201d For Murphy, Brexit was flawed from the outset. \u201cIt was a binary choice. There\u2019s no nuance, you can\u2019t put any of that into a referendum,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can say, \u2018yes, we\u2019ll leave the EU\u2019, but no one knew how.\u201d Get Murphy on a subject he is passionate about and you get a flash of Tommy Shelby. Not the searing menace or the much-copied haircut, but the more human side who justifies his actions for the welfare of his family. \u201cI really don\u2019t identify with him. He\u2019s a total stranger to me, but he\u2019s the only character I\u2019ve returned to in my career,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cHe is a relentless character \u2013 he never sleeps, he never eats \u2013 his ambition is limitless. So you need to be able to embody that.\u201d He says it takes him two months to \u201cshake off\u201d Tommy. His hair grows back, he goes away with his family and things slowly return to normal. But there is a price to be paid. \u201cAsk any actor \u2013 if you do something well there\u2019s inevitably some sort of exchange. It\u2019s not a methody thing, it\u2019s not a conscious thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI could never go on to another character \u2013 firstly, because you\u2019ve got that mad haircut, but because I need time to decompress because I\u2019m nothing like him. I\u2019m like his cowardly brother.\u201d",

The Soviet Union had collapsed, former communist countries were becoming market economies, independent central banks were all the rage and a multilateral trade deal was concluded after more than seven years of negotiations. Europe\u2019s integrationist project was in full swing, with preparations under way for a single currency. Politics during the 1990s was dominated by parties of the centre right and centre left, pursuing broadly similar economic policies: budgetary discipline, liberalising capital flows, encouraging the incursion of the market into sectors hitherto off limits. Whether in the developed countries of Europe or the emerging markets of Latin America, orthodoxy reined supreme. Sure, it was accepted that there were teething problems with the new world order, but the cold war was over and Russia no longer a threat. America would use its unchallenged military might to police the world and keep factories booming internationally through its willingness to act as the consumer of last resort.</p> <p>Little of this utopian vision has survived. There has not been a completed set of multilateral trade talks since the <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact5_e.htm\" title=\"\">Uruguay round</a> was wrapped up in late 1993, in large part because this was the last time the US and the EU were able to carve out a deal to their mutual interest and then impose it on the rest of the world.</p> <p>The G7 \u2013 the US, Canada, Japan and the four biggest economies of Europe \u2013 no longer call all the shots at international summits. The independence of central banks is threatened. The US is unwilling to soak up all the world\u2019s excess production and instead demands that countries such as Germany run down their trade surpluses. Europe\u2019s drive for integration has stalled. Parties of the centre have been hollowed out, either because they failed to spot the weaknesses inherent in globalisation or were too timid to act if they did. The Washington consensus \u2013 that there was a one-size-fits-all solution to the problems of developing countries that involved privatisation, abandoning capital controls and budgetary rectitude \u2013 has fallen into disrepute. And Russia is not the busted flush it was supposed to be. The risk that the current iteration of globalisation could end in military conflict is much higher than generally acknowledged.</p> <p>To prevent such an outcome, there needs to be change at all levels, starting with the local one. Even during its heyday, large chunks of economic activity remained untouched by globalisation and that segment is likely to grow as economies become more service-sector dominated. In addition, countries such as the US are already bringing production back within its borders \u2013 in part because of the high cost of transporting goods around the world, and in part because technological change \u2013 greater use of robots and artificial intelligence \u2013 has reduced the financial incentive to offshore.</p> <p>There is also going to be an enhanced role for the nation state, the death of which has been exaggerated. It will no longer be good enough for politicians to fob off voters with the idea that globalisation is an unstoppable force of nature against which they are powerless. Telling the public that inequality, industrial decay and stagnant living standards are something they have to suck up is asking for big populist trouble.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb6d6d06dc860cb262a0030f4bc84dc54042b7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb6d6d06dc860cb262a0030f4bc84dc54042b7d/0_140_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The US is unwilling to soak up all the world\u2019s excess production.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/12/the-900bn-question-what-is-the-belt-and-road-initiative\" title=\"\">Belt and Road initiative</a> is an example of how countries are starting to operate at a sub-global level. Beijing\u2019s network of infrastructure projects across Asia and Europe has a dual purpose: to provide a market for Chinese goods and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/03/china-will-build-string-of-military-bases-around-world-says-pentagon\" title=\"\">extend Beijing\u2019s reach in parts of the world</a> where America\u2019s hard and soft power is weak. Similarly, trade deals are likely to be negotiated bilaterally or among coalitions of the willing.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019s a need for reform at a global level: to mobilise effective climate-change action, to meet the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goals, to rein in the power of global finance through curbs on capital flows, and to piece together a system of rules-based, but managed, trade.</p> <p>None of this will be easy \u2013 in fact, it will be hellishly difficult. But three developments provide cause for optimism. The first is that the failings of the current system have become too big to ignore. The second is that failure has, as ever, led to new thinking. The third is that the new ideas are starting to influence policy.</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor</p>",

Beijing\u2019s network of infrastructure projects across Asia and Europe has a dual purpose: to provide a market for Chinese goods and to extend Beijing\u2019s reach in parts of the world where America\u2019s hard and soft power is weak. Similarly, trade deals are likely to be negotiated bilaterally or among coalitions of the willing. Finally, there\u2019s a need for reform at a global level: to mobilise effective climate-change action, to meet the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goals, to rein in the power of global finance through curbs on capital flows, and to piece together a system of rules-based, but managed, trade. None of this will be easy \u2013 in fact, it will be hellishly difficult. But three developments provide cause for optimism. The first is that the failings of the current system have become too big to ignore. The second is that failure has, as ever, led to new thinking. The third is that the new ideas are starting to influence policy. \u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor",

      "body": "<p>Ten years ago, the Department of Homeland Security sent American law enforcement agencies an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/16/obama-rightwing-extremism-threat\">intelligence briefing</a> warning of a rising threat of domestic rightwing extremism, including white supremacist terrorism.</p> <p>The economic recession and the election of America\u2019s first black president would create fertile ground for rightwing radicalization, the 2009 report concluded.

The report was politically motivated and unfairly demonized conservative views, they argued. \u201cAmericans are not the enemy.

The small team of domestic terrorism analysts who had produced the report was disbanded, and analysts were reassigned to study Muslim extremism, according to Daryl Johnson, the career federal intelligence analyst who had led the team. By the next year, Johnson says, he had been forced out of the DHS altogether.</p> <p>Since then, Johnson has watched a rising tide of white nationalist terror attacks around the world.

He wanted me to see swooping dots in the sky, a flight of swallows, maybe a hundred strong, preparing to roost.

      "bodyText": "At dusk, the campsite owner popped his head into the washing-up hut and the clatter of tin mugs to ask me to come outside. He wanted me to see swooping dots in the sky, a flight of swallows, maybe a hundred strong, preparing to roost. There had been more than 2,000 swallows here a couple of years ago; he attributed their decline to Chinese mist nets around the Mediterranean, particularly in north Africa, where millions of migrant birds have been trapped to be eaten. I thought of Sir Philip Sidney\u2019s 1590 poem The Countess of Pembroke\u2019s Arcadia when he talks about man\u2019s cruelty to animals: \u201cWorst fell to smallest birds [\u2026] At length for glutton taste he did kill them; / At last for sport their silly lives did spill.\u201d Hundreds of years later, the situation is even more desperate for migrating birds. Chaucer (in The Parliament of Fowls) called the swallow a murderer of \u201cthe fowles small that maken hony of flowres fresshe of hewe\u201d, ie bees, and there were both swallows and bees flying over the coastal footpath the following day \u2013 but not as many as there should be. Rounding on to the headland revealed a patch of flowers: lilac thistle, pink bramble and purple knapweed, supporting a circus of flying butterflies: an embarkation of painted ladies, a creaking of gatekeepers, a mowing of meadow-browns. I haven\u2019t seen a gathering of so many butterflies in one place for decades and, although it couldn\u2019t counteract the horror story of migrating birds caught in nets, it was a joyous flutter of the heart.

      "bodyText": "A serious outbreak of malaria in Burundi has reached epidemic proportions, killing almost as many people as the Ebola crisis in the nearby Democratic Republic of the Congo. The outbreak in the tiny Great Lakes country has infected almost half the total population, killing about 1,800 people since the beginning of the year. According to figures gathered by the World Health Organisation, almost 6 million cases have been recorded since the first week of January to the end of July, with infections reaching crisis levels in May. The figures look on course to outstrip the epidemic of 2017, when more 6 million cases were recorded for the whole year. The situation has continued to worsen as the government of Burundi has refused to declare an emergency. The scale of the outbreak was described in the latest report for the UN\u2019s office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which warned that the outbreak had reached \u201cepidemic\u201d proportions. \u201cThe national malaria outbreak response plan, which is currently being validated, has highlighted a lack of human, logistical and financial resources for effective response,\u201d reported the organisation. The organisation and other experts have blamed a number of issues for the crisis, including low use of preventative measures and a vulnerable population with low levels of resistance. Experts have also noted an increase in drug resistant strains of the disease in common with other parts of the world. The climate crisis has been cited as a contributing factor. Mosquitoes, which spread the disease, are reaching higher altitudes in the mountainous country, and have displayed behavioural changes including more aggressive feeding habits. The country\u2019s agricultural policies have also encouraged an increase in rice production that has seen farmers encroach on mosquito-infested areas. While Burundi has long struggled with malaria, the figures for the current outbreak suggest a 50% increase compared to the equivalent period last year. The UN organisation noted bleakly that the number of health districts that have passed the epidemic threshold had continued to increase. Although Burundi declared a national health emergency in 2017 after 1.8 million cases and 700 deaths were recorded, it has declined to declare one for the current outbreak, apparently concerned of the potential impact ahead of elections slated for next year. \u201cWe are less than a year away from the presidential election,\u201d one anonymous official told the AFP news agency. \u201c[President Pierre] Nkurunziza, who is facing many crises, does not want to recognise what could be considered a failure of his health policy,\u201d the official said. The country has been in the throes of a crisis since 2015 when Nkurunziza ran for a third term and was re-elected, while the majority of the opposition boycotted the polls. At least 1,000 people were killed and more than 400,000 displaced in violence the UN says was mostly carried out by state security forces.",

Brandon Lee, 37, who is married to a Filipina woman, was in a critical condition after suffering cardiac arrests during surgery to remove a bullet from his jaw after the shooting in Ifugao province in the northern Philippines on 6 August, according to a local rights group, the Cordillera Human Rights Alliance. Lee is a volunteer at the Ifugao Peasant Movement (IPM), a farmers\u2019 group actively opposing a hydropower project and growing military presence in the Cordillera region. The attack comes a year after one of IPM\u2019s staff members was killed in a similar attack in 2018. The Philippines has been the most dangerous country in the world for people defending their land and environment under the hardline presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, according to independent watchdog Global Witness. Lee and several IPM staff had been tagged \u201cenemy of the state\u201d as early as 2015 in posters placed around the province. They were accused of being members of the communist rebel group New People\u2019s Army (NPA), a claim they denied. The allegation continues to circulate on social media. Cordillera Human Rights Alliance, where Lee also volunteers as a paralegal, accused the government of perpetrating Tuesday\u2019s attack. \u201cWe hold accountable the state security forces that the Duterte administration has let loose in the Cordillera region,\u201d the group said in a statement. The group said Lee had been receiving threats and was being followed prior to the attack. In 2015, Cordillera Human Rights Alliance submitted a position paper to a US Congress committee to report harassments and threats against human rights workers in the province.",

FireEye said despite the group\u2019s focus on financial gain, the espionage activity linked to it was more closely aligned with the behaviour of state-sponsored actors. APT41, which has been in operation since at least 2012, had repeatedly gained access to game development environments, with a particular focus on in-game currency, FireEye said. In one case, it generated tens of millions of dollars in the game\u2019s virtual currency, which was then credited to more than 1,000 accounts. FireEye said some of the group\u2019s attention to video game companies could be seen as a precursor to espionage activity.

APT41 targets industries associated with China\u2019s economic plans, or to gather intelligence for upcoming mergers and acquisitions, or political events. FireEye said APT41 had targeted organisations in 14 countries over seven years \u2013 France, India, Italy, Japan, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the UK and the United States. The sectors targeted were healthcare, high tech, media, pharmaceuticals, retail, software companies, telecoms, travel services, education, video games and virtual currencies.

With no weasel words about the need for a regulatory impact statement or cost benefit analysis, the government promised to act on all of Hayne\u2019s recommendations.</p> <p>So, what\u2019s going on? How can the government accept the recommendations for the banking sector, yet still declare war on red tape and regulation?</p> <p>If conservatives were serious about removing red tape Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to sue Samsung for making a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/25/apple-samsung-patent-infringement-trial\"> smartphone in the shape of a rectangle</a>; Adani wouldn\u2019t be able to demand that a Wangan and Jagalingou man <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/mining/adani-tries-to-bankrupt-wangan-and-jagalingou-man-adrian-burragubba/news-story/46aefeeca5f02c61f73b3840cfdddad1\">Adrian Burragubba,</a><a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/mining/adani-tries-to-bankrupt-wangan-and-jagalingou-man-adrian-burragubba/news-story/46aefeeca5f02c61f73b3840cfdddad1\"> pay them $600,000 in legal costs</a>; and without regulation, the government\u2019s Australian Building and Construction Commission wouldn\u2019t be able to charge union officials for <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/news/policy/industrial-relations/judge-turns-on-abcc-for-wasting-time-over-cup-of-tea-cfmeu-incident-20170312-guw6aw\">having a cup of tea with a friend</a> at a worksite.</p> <p>Indeed, conservatives love regulating the behaviour of their enemies. The right to strike is a fundamental human right, enshrined in international law, but no such protection exists in Australia \u2013 without permission from a bureaucrat at the Fair Work Commission, that is.</p> <p>And, if you have an accident at work, there are specific laws that prevent most people from taking their employer to court for damages. While millionaires can get hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages if their feelings get hurt by defamatory statements, if you are permanently disabled in an industrial accident, there are <a href=\"https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/workers-compensation\">laws that cap how much compensation you can get</a>. And it\u2019s a lot less than for the hurt feelings of a millionaire.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s abortion. It is still a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/arrest-us-women-who-have-had-abortions-speak-out-to-support-nsw-decriminalisation\">criminal offence for a woman to get an abortion in New South Wales</a>. The independent MP Alex Greenwich has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/alex-greenwich-hits-back-at-incorrect-claims-about-nsw-abortion-bill\">introduced a bill</a> to remove this anachronistic law, but \u2013 guess what \u2013 a bunch of conservatives think that there is no need to reduce the red tape women endure to access this particular medical procedure.</p> <p>You would think that those who say the individual is best placed to make their own decisions would champion a woman\u2019s right to choose. You would think that those who rage against unnecessary government interference in our lives would be on the side of the liberty of individuals in the battle against oppression by the collective. But no, not in Australia.</p> <p>The same is evident in Australia\u2019s so-called \u201canti-terror\u201d regulations. According to <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267203154_A_decade_of_Australian_anti-terror_laws\">George Williams</a>, since 2001 successive Australian governments have introduced more anti-terrorism laws than any other country in the world.

By arguing for deregulation in the market-sphere and regulation in the private-sphere, John Howard deregulated the labour market and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/23/the-answers-in-the-post-australian-marriage-equality-vote-explainer\">regulated who could marry</a>; he wanted free trade deals but opposed voluntary euthanasia; he wanted to privatise our national assets but publicly <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/howards-secret-abortion-agenda-20050211-gdzjf0.html\">control a woman\u2019s right to choose</a>.</p> <p>There is nothing right or wrong, good or bad, efficient or inefficient about regulation. Different people, in different countries, at different points in time all have different opinions about which regulations are good and which are bad. Conservatives in the US are obsessed with the right of people to own semi-automatic weapons, but in Australia, it was Howard who won the fight to introduce bans on those killing machines.</p> <p>When powerful people in Australia want more freedom, they demand less regulation \u2013 usually on the basis that it will create jobs. But when powerless people want regulations, the powerful resist and claim it will \u201ccost jobs\u201d.</p> <p>Regulations don\u2019t create or destroy jobs \u2013 they\u2019re simply the rules we collectively agree we should all live by \u2013 but, as we\u2019ve seen with the banking, building and aged care sectors, a lack of regulation can destroy lives.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute</p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia needs more regulation of the banks, more regulation of the aged care sector, more regulation of property developers, more regulation of the mining industry and more regulation of the way we use the water in our rivers. But conservatives are still calling for a reduction of so-called red tape. WTF? Hundreds of high-rise buildings in Australia are clad in the same flammable materials that caused the deaths of 72 people in London\u2019s Grenfell Tower disaster. No \u201cred tape\u201d was there to stop the materials being imported past our \u201cstrong borders\u201d. No red tape stopped builders installing it. And no red tape stood in the way of potentially deadly buildings being certified as safe to inhabit before units were sold to unsuspecting families. Frail elderly people in Australian aged care centres are physically restrained and overmedicated to make them easier to manage. The aged care royal commission has found evidence of chronic understaffing and a lack of training at multiple aged care centres. Malnutrition is not uncommon, nor are bed sores. Coalmining in Sydney\u2019s main water catchment has resulted in bright-orange water in the tributaries that supply the city\u2019s drinking water. And at the same time that climate change threatens Sydney\u2019s water supply, subsidence cracks from one coalmine have led to an estimated 1.3bn litres of water being lost from the city\u2019s dams. Despite this, Peabody Energy are seeking to expand their coalmining under the catchment, and the Morrison government is keen to speed up approval processes for new mines. The royal commission into banking spent months highlighting how easy it is for powerful institutions to exploit vulnerable Australians. After hearing evidence of the structural and moral weaknesses of Australia\u2019s largest financial institutions \u2013 including stealing from dead people \u2013 Kenneth Hayne made 76 recommendations for more regulation. With no weasel words about the need for a regulatory impact statement or cost benefit analysis, the government promised to act on all of Hayne\u2019s recommendations. So, what\u2019s going on? How can the government accept the recommendations for the banking sector, yet still declare war on red tape and regulation? If conservatives were serious about removing red tape Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to sue Samsung for making a smartphone in the shape of a rectangle; Adani wouldn\u2019t be able to demand that a Wangan and Jagalingou man Adrian Burragubba, pay them $600,000 in legal costs; and without regulation, the government\u2019s Australian Building and Construction Commission wouldn\u2019t be able to charge union officials for having a cup of tea with a friend at a worksite. Indeed, conservatives love regulating the behaviour of their enemies. The right to strike is a fundamental human right, enshrined in international law, but no such protection exists in Australia \u2013 without permission from a bureaucrat at the Fair Work Commission, that is. And, if you have an accident at work, there are specific laws that prevent most people from taking their employer to court for damages. While millionaires can get hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages if their feelings get hurt by defamatory statements, if you are permanently disabled in an industrial accident, there are laws that cap how much compensation you can get. And it\u2019s a lot less than for the hurt feelings of a millionaire. Then there\u2019s abortion. It is still a criminal offence for a woman to get an abortion in New South Wales. The independent MP Alex Greenwich has introduced a bill to remove this anachronistic law, but \u2013 guess what \u2013 a bunch of conservatives think that there is no need to reduce the red tape women endure to access this particular medical procedure. You would think that those who say the individual is best placed to make their own decisions would champion a woman\u2019s right to choose. You would think that those who rage against unnecessary government interference in our lives would be on the side of the liberty of individuals in the battle against oppression by the collective. But no, not in Australia. The same is evident in Australia\u2019s so-called \u201canti-terror\u201d regulations. According to George Williams, since 2001 successive Australian governments have introduced more anti-terrorism laws than any other country in the world. Indeed, Australia\u2019s response to the attacks of 9/11 has been to create more anti-terrorism laws than the US itself. Why do Australian conservatives obsess about \u201cfreeing workers\u201d from collective bargaining so they can be pushed on to individual contracts, but not a woman\u2019s right to choose whether to have an abortion? It\u2019s easy to understand rightwing Australia once you realise it is defined by interests and not ideas. By arguing for deregulation in the market-sphere and regulation in the private-sphere, John Howard deregulated the labour market and regulated who could marry; he wanted free trade deals but opposed voluntary euthanasia; he wanted to privatise our national assets but publicly control a woman\u2019s right to choose. There is nothing right or wrong, good or bad, efficient or inefficient about regulation. Different people, in different countries, at different points in time all have different opinions about which regulations are good and which are bad. Conservatives in the US are obsessed with the right of people to own semi-automatic weapons, but in Australia, it was Howard who won the fight to introduce bans on those killing machines. When powerful people in Australia want more freedom, they demand less regulation \u2013 usually on the basis that it will create jobs. But when powerless people want regulations, the powerful resist and claim it will \u201ccost jobs\u201d. Regulations don\u2019t create or destroy jobs \u2013 they\u2019re simply the rules we collectively agree we should all live by \u2013 but, as we\u2019ve seen with the banking, building and aged care sectors, a lack of regulation can destroy lives. \u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute",

Gray credited the campaign with \u201crevitalising the union movement in Victoria\u201d, citing three mass mobilisations leading up to the election. \u201cThe union movement doesn\u2019t want to be like the political parties, eating themselves after federal election losses.\u201d Unions have heavily invested in political campaigns since the former ACTU secretary Dave Oliver introduced a permanent campaign levy on affiliates in 2015 to attempt to replicate the success of the Your Rights at Work campaign which helped unseat the Howard government in 2007. Tim Kennedy, the National Union of Workers national secretary, said in May that the 2019 campaign talked about \u201cthe right issues at the right time\u201d but questioned whether Change the Rules was \u201ca vague solution\u201d. \u201cThe movement lives and dies on whether people have hope to join and act in concert \u2013 you do that first and the rest follows,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cI think [organising] needs to be first, second and third priority.\u201d \u201cThe reality is a media political campaigning strategy is alluring because it is exciting \u2013 but nothing beats the fundamental relationship of organising.\u201d Tim Lyons, a former assistant secretary of the ACTU, criticised the campaign as \u201cnebulous\u201d and lamented that targeting blue-ribbon seats was a \u201chubristic vanity project\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Cocaine with a street value of around $2m (NZ$3m) has washed up in packages on a wild New Zealand beach, sparking a major search for further drugs by police and local residents. On Wednesday evening people at Bethells Beach on the west coast of Auckland told police they had found mysterious blue packages with odd symbols printed on them, strewn along the rugged coast. Police confirmed the packages tested positive for cocaine, and sent a helicopter and search teams to hunt for more drugs. \u201cThere is a small possibility that further packages may turn up on the beach and we ask any members of the public to contact us immediately if they do,\u201d said Det Insp Colin Parmenter of Waitemat\u00e4 police in a statement. \u201cEagle helicopter will be in the area today conducting a search of the wider area and we will be sending regular patrols in the coming days to continue to check for further washed up items,\u201d he said. Jose Sousa-Santos, a Pacific crime researcher at Massey University in New Zealand, said the cocaine was likely to have originated from Peru or Colombia, where it could be purchased for between US$7-7,500 per kilogram. Cocaine is New Zealand\u2019s most expensive illicit drug, sold for about $250,000 per kilogram. In the UK, the drug\u2019s street value is $50,000-60,000 per kilogram. \u201cThere is a huge mark-up and quite a big margin of profit to be made by these syndicates. So they can definitely afford to lose consignments to the tune of $3m,\u201d said Santos. Santos said the shipment was most likely thrown overboard by smugglers who feared detection by maritime patrols or law enforcement, or, it may have come free of a covert mooring, where it would have been weighted down and had a radio tracking device attached to allow a smaller vessel to collect it for the last leg of the journey to New Zealand. Because of Bethells Beach location on the west coast of New Zealand, Santos also thought there was a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d the drugs had been trafficked across the Tasman from Australia \u2013 a distance of just 2,000km that required much smaller boats and less logistical planning. Recent research by Santos indicated that New Zealand deportees from Australia may also be involved in the drug trade between the two countries. \u201cMany of these deportees have very strong ties to outlaw motorcycle gangs and criminal syndicates in Australia. And when they come to New Zealand they often have no family links, they have no ties to the community or job opportunities so they go back into the pattern of reoffending,\u201d said Santos.

Hundreds of kilos of drugs have also been discovered buried in sand dunes, in the hulls of boats, and once \u2013 in a massive diamante-encrusted horse head sent from Mexico.

Hastie, who chairs the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, accused China in an opinion piece for Nine newspapers of trying to supplant the US as the dominant power in the Indo-Pacific region.

In a statement on Thursday the Chinese embassy said: \u201cWe strongly deplore the Australian federal MP Andrew Hastie\u2019s rhetoric on \u2018China threat\u2019 which lays bare his Cold-War mentality and ideological bias. \u201cIt goes against the world trend of peace, cooperation and development.

      "bodyText": "Residents in small South Australian communities shortlisted for a proposed nuclear waste storage facility have been told if they want to attend community consultation meetings they have to sign a code of conduct that bans them from taking notes. The shortlist for the proposed dump has been narrowed down to Lyndhurst or Napandee, in the Kimba shire area on the Eyre Peninsula, and Wallerberdina Station, which is near Barndioota in the southern Flinders Ranges. If approved, it would be a permanent storage facility for low-level nuclear waste and provide temporary storage for intermediate level waste, including waste temporarily stored near the research reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney. The process has been stalled for more than 12 months because of a federal court challenge by Barngarla traditional owners, who hold native title over land adjacent to the two proposed Eyre Peninsula sites. Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation last month lost a federal court case arguing that a decision not to include native title holders in a local government poll gauging community support for the dump was in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act, but have appealed that decision to the full court. A majority of Adnyamathanha traditional owners have also said they\u2019re \u201ctotally opposed\u201d to the facility being built at Barndioota. Meetings of two local consultative committees, appointed by the federal industry department\u2019s National Radioactive Waste Management Facility Taskforce (NRWMFT) as its main platform for ongoing community consultation, were put on hold while the court case was underway but have been scheduled to resume next week. But locals have complained that a new code of conduct for people wishing to observe the Barndioota and Kimba consultative committee meetings is unnecessarily restrictive and makes it harder for the community to obtain up-to-date information and voice their concerns. The code, seen by Guardian Australia, states that \u201cobservers\u201d must be approved and cannot \u201ctake any notes, or record any part of the meeting \u2026 except with the prior agreement of the department, the independent convenor and all representative members of the committee\u201d. It also says they cannot \u201crepeat or share the individual ideas or views of [committee] members,\u201d and can\u2019t repeat confidential information or try to interject in committee discussions. \u201cThis agreement does not prevent you from discussing information shared during a BCC meeting unless it has been identified as confidential or sensitive,\u201d it says. \u201cThe [convenor] may ask you to leave the meeting if you do not comply with this Code of Conduct.\u201d Grazier Dean Hooper, who has applied to attend the Barndioota meeting, said that restrictions on repeating confidential information and behaving respectfully were reasonable but other conditions placed on attending were \u201cbullshit\u201d. \u201cThey are trying to keep it low and quiet and get this dump to happen as easily and quickly and quietly as possible,\u201d he said. Hooper opposes the dump and is a member of the Flinders local action group. The NRWMFT said that the code of conduct concerned behavioural standards and that information in the meeting was not confidential, unless stated otherwise, and that the minutes of all meetings had been published online. Committee members have also been restricted from discussing meetings with the media. Susan Andersson, a GP from Hawker who sits on the Bandioota committee, said the contract extension that committee members signed in March was \u201cmore restrictive\u201d than the original contract and represented an apparent desire by the department to control public information. NRWMFT general manager Sam Chard said the facility \u201cwill only proceed near a community that broadly supports it and which could provide an ongoing workforce\u201d. In a statement on Wednesday, she said that ballots of residents and ratepayers, like that attempted by Kimba before the federal court challenge, \u201cremain one method that we intend to use to help inform if that necessary broad community support exists\u201d. People living outside the local government areas can make a submission.",

      "bodyText": "Puerto Rico has a new governor. Wanda V\u00e1zquez is the island\u2019s third governor in the past six days. As Trump headed to El Paso, to meet with victims of a gunman linked a screed against \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d, immigration officials arrested 680 mostly Latino workers today. The raids at food processing plants in Mississippi amounted to the largest workplace sting in at least a decade. Trump met with victims and first responders in El Paso as both protestors and supporters gathered in the city. Former El Paso representative and 2020 candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke spoke at a rally preceding Trump\u2019s visit and met with those affected by the shooting. He announced that he will pause campaigning in order to spend more time in his hometown. Trump visited Dayton earlier, where Democratic officials including mayor Nan Whaley and senator Sherrod Brown pushed the president to demand concrete action on gun control. The president concluded that it has been an \u201camazing day\u201d and told members of the press, who were not allowed to join during his hospital visits, \u201cI wish you could have been there to see it.\u201d Joe Biden delivered his Iowa speech condemning Trump for having \u201cfanned the flames of white supremacy\u201d, prompting a tweet from the president that the address was \u201csooo boring\u201d. The House judiciary committee has asked a federal judge to force the testimony of the former White House counsel Don McGahn. He was first subpoenaed back in April, but his testimony has been blocked by the White House. Representative Elijah Cummings encouraged Trump to visit his district in Baltimore, which the president recently attacked as a \u201crat and rodent infested mess\u201d in a string of racist tweets. CNN\u2019s Oliver Darcy followed up with the White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham about why press weren\u2019t allowed to join Trump during his Dayton hospital visit. In response, she said that the presence of journalists would have overwhelmed patients, their families, and staff, adding that press access was never promised. Meanwhile, Tim Ryan, the 2020 candidate and Ohio representative, addressed senator Mitch McConnell: \u201cWhere are your guts Mitch? Grab your cojones and do something.\u201d Ryan and other Democrats are urging McConnell to call the Senate into session to vote on gun legislation. Beto O\u2019Rourke offered his personal number to a survivor of the shooting in El Paso. O\u2019Rouke has also told CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner that he\u2019ll be visiting Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico to attend the funerals of several victims who lived there. Wrapping up his visit with victims, families and staff at a hospital in El Paso, Trump said, \u201cWe had an amazing day.\u201d To members of the press who were barred from joining him during his visits at hospitals in El Paso and Dayton, he said, \u201cI wish you could have been there to see it.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke has said that Donald Trump is a white supremacist. The 2020 candidate and former El Paso representative earlier spoke at a rally protesting the president\u2019s visit. O\u2019Rourke is canceling campaign stops in Iowa and will remain in his hometown of El Paso as it copes with the aftermath of the mass shooting this weekend. Trump just posted photos from his visit to a hospital in Dayton, where the press pool was not allowed because it was \u201cnot a photo op\u201d Wanda V\u00e1zquez has been sworn in as the new governor of Puerto Rico. V\u00e1zquez, the former justice secretary took the oath of office at the Puerto Rican supreme court, which earlier today declared unconstitutional the appointment of governor Pedro Pierluisi, who was sworn in as a replacement for disgraced governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 this weekend. The question of who will lead the island territory is settled, at least for now, though the appointment could spark more protests from those who oppose V\u00e1zquez. From the AP: People began cheering in some parts of San Juan after the ruling was announced, and Puerto Ricans were expected to gather later outside the governor\u2019s seaside mansion in the capital\u2019s colonial district \u2014 some to celebrate the court\u2019s decision and others to protest the incoming governor. In the early afternoon, someone yelled through a loudspeaker near the residence: \u201cPierluisi out! The constitution of Puerto Rico should be respected!\u201d... Pierluisi was appointed secretary of state by then-Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 while legislators were in recess, and only the House approved his nomination. Pierluisi was then sworn in as governor Friday after Rossell\u00f3 formally resigned in response to the protests. Puerto Rico\u2019s Senate sued to challenge Pierluisi\u2019s legitimacy as governor, arguing that its approval was also necessary, and the Supreme Court decided in favor of the Senate. The Senate had also asked the court to declare unconstitutional a portion of a 2005 law saying a secretary of state need not be approved by both House and Senate if they have to step in as governor. Puerto Rico\u2019s constitution says a secretary of state has to be approved by both chambers. The court agreed that the law\u2019s clause was unconstitutional... V\u00e1zquez became justice secretary in January 2017. She previously worked as a district attorney for two decades at Puerto Rico\u2019s justice department, handling domestic and sexual abuse cases, and in 2010 was appointed director of the Office for Women\u2019s Rights. Some critics say that as justice secretary that she was not aggressive enough in pursuing corruption investigations involving members of her New Progressive Party and that she did not prioritize gender violence cases. Immigration officials arrested 680 mostly Latino workers today at food processing plants in Mississippi, in the largest workplace sting in at least a decade, according to the Associated Press. The raids, planned months ago, happened just hours before President Donald Trump was scheduled to visit El Paso, Texas, the majority-Latino city where a man linked to an online screed about a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d was charged in a shooting that left 22 people dead in the border city. Workers filled three buses \u2013 two for men and one for women \u2013 at a Koch Foods Inc plant in tiny Morton, 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Jackson. They were taken to a military hangar to be processed for immigration violations. About 70 family, friends and residents waved goodbye and shouted, \u201cLet them go! Let them go!\u201d Later, two more buses arrived. A tearful 13-year-old boy whose parents are from Guatemala waved goodbye to his mother, a Koch worker, as he stood beside his father. Some employees tried to flee on foot but were captured in the parking lot. Workers who were confirmed to have legal status were allowed to leave the plant after having their trunks searched. The president and first lady are now visiting first responders, hospital staff, victims and their families at El Paso\u2019s University Medical Center as supporters and opponents gather outside. Amnesty International has issued a travel warning for visitors to the US due to ongoing \u201crampant gun violence\u201d, advising people to exercise caution in public spaces. According to a press release from the organization, the advisory is meant to mimic similar travel advisories that the US State Department issues to Americans visiting other countries. Amnesty International has been advocating for regulating guns for years, and last month published a report on the mental and physical trauma sustained by survivors of gun violence in the US. \u201cUnder international human rights law the United States as an obligation to enact a range of measures at the federal, state, and local levels to regulate access to firearms,\u201d the advisory reads. That\u2019s it from me on the blog today. My west coast colleague Maanvi Singh will be taking over for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump has just arrived in El Paso to meet with victims and first responders from Saturday\u2019s shooting. But hundreds in the city are protesting his visit given the parallels between the president\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and that of the white nationalist shooter. Trump visited Dayton earlier, where Democratic officials like Mayor Nan Whaley and Senator Sherrod Brown pushed the president to demand concrete action on gun control. Joe Biden delivered his Iowa speech condemning Trump for having \u201cfanned the flames of white supremacy\u201d, prompting a tweet from the president that the address was \u201csooo boring\u201d. The House judiciary committee has asked a federal judge to force the testimony of the former White House counsel Don McGahn. He was first subpoenaed back in April, but his testimony has been blocked by the White House. Representative Elijah Cummings encouraged Trump to visit his district in Baltimore, which the president recently attacked as a \u201crat and rodent infested mess\u201d in a string of racist tweets. Maanvi will have more on Trump\u2019s visit to El Paso, so stay tuned. The House judiciary committee has asked a federal judge to force testimony from Don McGahn, Trump\u2019s former White House counsel. McGahn, who featured prominently in the portion of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on whether the president obstructed justice, was subpoenaed by the panel back in April. But the White House has blocked his testimony, claiming he had \u201cabsolute\u201d immunity. This marks the first lawsuit House Democrats have filed to force a witness\u2019 testimony since regaining control of the chamber. House speaker Nancy Pelosi notified her caucus about the imminent lawsuit in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter earlier today. Some scenes from the El Paso protests: Air Force One has touched down in El Paso, where the president is expected to meet with victims and first responders from Saturday\u2019s shooting as hundreds in the city protest his visit. Asked by a CNN reporter what he thought of Trump\u2019s tweet on his speech, Joe Biden said, \u201cHe should get a life.\u201d The president called Biden\u2019s speech, in which he condemned Trump for having \u201cfanned the flames of white supremacy,\u201d \u201csooo boring\u201d in the tweet. Trump reiterated claims from one of his senior advisers, Dan Scavino, that Senator Sherrod Brown and Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley misrepresented the president\u2019s visit with shooting victims and first responders. But again, it was unclear what the Trump camp was referring to, given that Brown himself said the president had been greeted warmly by those at the Dayton hospital. \u201cHe was received well by the patients, as you\u2019d expect,\u201d Brown said earlier. \u201cThey were hurting; he was comforting. He did the right things; Melania did the right things. And it\u2019s his job in part to comfort people.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke is speaking at the protest rally in El Paso as Trump prepares to touch down in the mourning city: Just before Trump arrived in El Paso, the city\u2019s mayor pro tempore and county commissioner released a statement demanding that the president \u201cpersonally condemn racial terrorism by white supremacists, in no uncertain terms.\u201d Mayor Pro Tempore Claudia Ordaz Perez and County Commissioner Vincent Perez said in the statement, \u201cIf the President fails to strongly condemn this racially-motivated terrorist attack and fails to call for an end to the use of violence against minority groups by radicalized white nationalist terrorists during his visit, his continued depiction of immigrants and migrants as a threat to our nation will only place our community at greater risk for racially-motivated attacks.\u201d The El Paso Police Department refuted a claim, shared by organizers at a protest rally against Trump\u2019s visit, that another victim of this weekend\u2019s shooting had passed away: As police began to cordon off roadways in preparation for Trump\u2019s arrival, hundreds gathered in El Paso\u2019s Washington Park, mere streets away from the Mexican border. They stood under the sweltering sun to protest Trump\u2019s visit, holding signs reading \u201cTrump is a racist\u201d and \u201cProtect our kids, not the NRA.\u201d Volunteers passed out water and registered people to vote. \u201cToday, we must come together and say, Donald Trump, your racism, your hatred, your bigotry are not welcome here,\u201d Adri Perez of the El Paso ACLU said to the crowd. \u201cWe must turn our grief into anger and our anger into action.\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s campaign thanked Trump for watching his speech on white supremacy. The president tweeted, apparently aboard Air Force One between Dayton and El Paso, that the address was \u201cSooo Boring.\u201d In this speech, Biden condemned Trump for having \u201cfanned the flames of white supremacy\u201d in America. The El Paso Police Department admonished mourners from \u201cclashing against each other\u201d at the memorial to the shooting victims: So it looks like the televisions on Air Force One are working. En route between Dayton and El Paso to meet with victims of this weekend\u2019s shootings, Trump lashed out against Joe Biden as he delivered a speech condemning the president for having \u201cfanned the flames of white supremacy.\u201d Biden had not yet wrapped up his speech in Burlington, Iowa, before Trump weighed in, predicting the address would cause news networks to \u201cdie in the ratings.\u201d A senior White House aide accused Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley of lying about Trump\u2019s visit to the city after this weekend\u2019s mass shooting. But it was unclear what Scavino was saying Brown lied about, given that the senator acknowledged the president was greeted warmly by the shooting\u2019s victims and first responders. \u201cHe was received well by the patients, as you\u2019d expect,\u201d Brown said earlier. \u201cThey were hurting; he was comforting. He did the right things; Melania did the right things. And it\u2019s his job in part to comfort people.\u201d Brown also said that Trump was vague about committing to action on reducing gun violence. Joe Biden is delivering his speech in Burlington, Iowa, condemning Trump for having \u201cfanned the flames of white supremacy.\u201d The former vice president also reminded the audience that he launched his campaign by warning that Trump represented a threat to the \u201csoul of America.\u201d He vowed to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons if elected president and said the country needed to fight domestic terrorism as strongly as it fought international terrorism. A number of Democratic presidential candidates will attend an Iowa forum this weekend on gun safety. The forum, held in Des Moines, will be hosted by the gun-control groups Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action. El Paso residents have been leaving signs at a memorial to the 22 victims who died in Saturday\u2019s shootings. An NBC News reporter shared this particularly striking message: Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley said she spoke to Trump about the need to reform gun laws during his trip to the city. \u201cI reiterated to the president the importance of action around these issues and guns and that the people of Dayton are waiting for action from Washington DC.\u201d Whaley said. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said he told Trump to press for a ban on assault weapons during the president\u2019s trip to Dayton. The president met with first responders and some of the shooting victims at a local hospital. Brown said Trump expressed a desire to give an award to the police officers who helped end the shooting quickly. \u201cI said, Mr. President, respectfully, the most important thing you can do for these police officers is take assault weapons off the street,\u201d Brown said. Trump was generally vague about committing to any concrete action on gun control. Brown said. Representative Elijah Cummings told the National Press Club that he routinely receives death threats for his work as chairman of the House oversight committee. \u201cIt\u2019s rarely that I go a week without getting a death threat,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to do my job.\u201d He also encouraged Trump to come visit Baltimore to have his false impressions of the city corrected. The president has left Dayton and is en route to El Paso, where he will likely encounter even more protesters. A number of El Paso leaders, including Representative Veronica Escobar, have called on Trump to cancel the visit given the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the shooter who killed 22 members of the community. Representative Elijah Cummings called on Congress to end its August recess to return to Capitol Hill and pass legislation to reduce gun violence. \u201cWhen you have people dying, come on now,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cPeople are dying. People are afraid.\u201d He specifically demanded that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell take up bills that have already passed the House. Cummings also expressed severe skepticism of Trump\u2019s comments that he would take a close look at strengthening background checks. \u201cEither you do it, or you don\u2019t,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cThe people simply want action.\u201d Representative Elijah Cummings recommended to the audience at the National Press Club that everyone read a recent op-ed by Michael Gerson, a former top aide to George W. Bush. \u201cRacism is the fire that left our country horribly disfigured,\u201d Gerson writes in the piece. \u201cIt is the beast we try to keep locked in the basement. When the president of the United States plays with that fire or takes that beast out for a walk, it is not just another political event, not just a normal day in campaign 2020. It is a cause for shame.\u201d A few hundred demonstrators greeted Trump at the Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton as he met with first responders and shooting victims, according to a pool report. The crowd appeared to be a mix of protesters and supporters of the president. Reporters spotted Trump campaign flags, American flags and at least one hand-written sign reading, \u201cImpeach.\u201d Representative Elijah Cummings is speaking at the National Press Club about Trump\u2019s racist comments on his majority-black district in Baltimore, which the president called a \u201crat and rodent infested mess.\u201d \u201cGod has called me to this moment,\u201d Cummings opened his remarks. \u201cI did not ask for it.\u201d The House oversight committee chairman also noted that the invitation and date for this speech was set two months ago, before Trump launched his racist attack. Cummings emphasized that he was \u201cso proud\u201d to represent the city of Baltimore and that America\u2019s \u201cnational leaders\u201d should be proud of those citizens as well. \u201cThank you, Baltimore,\u201d the congressman said. He argued that such attacks were meant to \u201cdistract\u201d Americans from the true issues, like prescription drug prices and voting rights. He also offered his condolences for those lost in this weekend\u2019s mass shootings. calling for an end to making \u201chateful, incendiary comments\u201d and \u201cencouraging reprehensible behavior.\u201d \u201cAs a country, we finally must say that enough is enough,\u201d Cummings said, demanding that Mitch McConnell take action on gun control. He shared that his 10-year-old niece had recently asked him a question: \u201cAre they going to put us in cages?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s just something wrong with that,\u201d Cummings said. The report of a man carrying a weapon near the USA Today headquarters in McLean, Virginia, thankfully appears to have been a false alarm: Reporters who traveled with the president to Dayton were unable to cover his visit to the Miami Valley Hospital, where he met with first responders and victims of the mass shooting. The only information about Trump\u2019s visit was provided by his press secretary via her Twitter account: USA Today\u2019s headquarters in McLean, Virginia, was evacuated following reports of a man near the building carrying a weapon. Police have advised people to avoid the area, and reporters shared images of the evacuated building. Here is where the day stands so far: Trump has arrived in Dayton to meet with first responders and victims of this weekend\u2019s mass shooting, but he has already been confronted by protesters demanding action to reduce gun violence. The president will soon head to El Paso, where thousands have asked that he consider his trip given this weekend\u2019s white nationalist attack that left 22 dead. Joe Biden will deliver an Iowa speech this afternoon condemning Trump for having \u201cfanned the flames of white supremacy.\u201d Representative Elijah Cummings will soon address the National Press Club, where he will certainly be asked about the president\u2019s racist attacks against him and his majority-black district in Baltimore. That\u2019s still coming up, so stay tuned. Fox News host Tucker Carlson has come under intense criticism for referring to white supremacy in America as a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d Our colleague Edward Helmore reports: Coming just days after a Texas man allegedly killed 22 people in El Paso after posting a manifesto complaining of a \u2018Hispanic invasion\u2019, the prime-time news star defended the president from criticisms of his rhetoric by disputing that Trump ever \u2018endorsed white supremacy or came close to endorsing white supremacy\u2019. \u2018If you were to assemble a list, a hierarchy of concerns, problems this country has, where would white supremacy be on the list? Right up there with Russia probably. It\u2019s actually not a real problem in America,\u2019 Carlson told his audience on Tuesday night. Claiming that white supremacy issue was being used by Democrats as a political tool, Carlson continued: \u2018This is a hoax. Just like the Russia hoax, it\u2019s a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power.\u2019 After the host made his false comments, the hashtags #FireTuckerCarlson and #BoycottTuckerCarlson started trending on Twitter. Some photos from the protests in Dayton, Ohio: Trump has arrived in Dayton, and he is already being confronted by protesters as he makes his way to Miami Valley Hospital, where he will meet with first responders and victims. A Reuters reporter shared this photo from his arrival: Representative Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who is running for president, mocked Trump\u2019s claim that his rhetoric \u201cbrings people together.\u201d Ryan previously criticized Trump for confusing Dayton with Toledo in his statement on the shootings. \u201cIt\u2019s indicative of what else he said during that press conference, how disconnected he is from what\u2019s happening in the country today,\u201d Ryan told CNN. \u201cI think he has a diminished mental capacity to be able to deal with the big problems that we have in the United States today.\u201d Trump has arrived in Dayton, where he is expected to meet with first responders and victims of this weekend\u2019s mass shooting that killed nine. He is also expected to be greeted by protesters demanding action to reduce gun violence. Trump promised before leaving Washington for Dayton and El Paso that he would pressure Congress to act on background checks. But he has made similar claims before and achieved no results, as a CNN reporter noted: Meanwhile, the cities themselves are just focused on mourning the loss of so many community members. From a Washington Post reporter currently in El Paso: Trump is already en route to Dayton and El Paso, but thousands have signed on to a letter asking him not to visit El Paso after a white nationalist echoing the president\u2019s language of a Hispanic \u201cinvasion\u201d killed 22 members of the community. The letter, first posted by the Border Network for Human Rights, attracted more than 17,000 signatures in less than 24 hours. The text demands that Trump not visit El Paso and instead \u201ctake a moment for genuine introspection, deep soul searching, and penance.\u201d \u201c[Y]our presence would bring no comfort, no respite from the pain so brutally and callously imposed upon us. We ask, instead, for your absence,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cWe say this because we recognize that it is your rhetoric and your actions that led us to this terrible moment.\u201d Trump\u2019s Dayton visit is also expected to attract protests, which the city\u2019s mayor has encouraged. Trump was also asked before leaving for Dayton and El Paso whether he was concerned about hate groups. \u201cI am concerned for any group of hate,\u201d Trump said, according to a pool report. \u201cI don\u2019t like it ... whether it\u2019s white supremacy or any other kind of supremacy, whether it\u2019s antifa, whether it\u2019s any group or kind of hate ... I am concerned about it and I\u2019ll do something about it.\u201d The Southern Poverty Law Center does not list antifa as a hate group because such far-left activists \u201cdo not promote hatred based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.\u201d Trump also said he would \u201cbe convincing people to do things they don\u2019t want to do, including in Congress.\u201d \u201cI have a lot of influence with a lot of people,\u201d the president said. \u201cI want to convince them to do the right thing, and I can tell you, we\u2019ve made a lot of headway.\u201d Just before leaving Washington to visit with shooting victims, the president kept up his mockery of critics who have condemned his anti-immigrant rhetoric. \u201cMy critics are political people that are trying to make points,\u201d Trump said, according to a pool report. \u201cI don\u2019t think it works. I would like to stay out of the political fray.\u201d Asked about what gun proposals he is considering, Trump said there is \u201cno political appetite\u201d for a ban on assault weapons, which has been backed by nearly all of his Democratic rivals in the 2020 race. But he seemed open to strengthening the background checks system, saying there is \u201ca great appetite\u201d for such a proposal. Cory Booker is delivering a speech on gun violence and white nationalism at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine African American parishioners were murdered by a white supremacist shooter in 2015. \u201cWhite supremacy has always been a problem in our American story,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate told the audience, drawing a line from slavery to \u201cdemagogues throughout generations who stoked racist and anti-immigrant hatred.\u201d \u201cRacist violence has always been a part of the American story,\u201d Booker said, going on to argue that the El Paso shooting \u201cdid not start with the hand that pulled the trigger.\u201d He said that such white nationalist sentiments were planted in \u201cfertile soil\u201d by those have encouraged such animus. He specifically referenced Trump\u2019s comments on Baltimore being \u201crat and rodent infested\u201d without mentioning the president\u2019s name. The question is not who is or isn\u2019t a racist, Booker said, but \u201cwho is and isn\u2019t doing something about it.\u201d \u201cThere is no neutrality in this fight,\u201d the New Jersey senator said, calling white supremacy \u201can issue of national security.\u201d Trump has also been tweeting about the New York Times changing its front-page headline yesterday about the president\u2019s Monday statement on the shootings. The newspaper changed its headline from \u201cTRUMP URGES UNITY VS RACISM\u201d to \u201cASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS\u201d between the first and second print editions. Many critics complained that the original headline fed Trump\u2019s narrative that those who called out his anti-immigrant rhetoric were simply playing politics. Some Times readers even threatened to cancel their subscriptions over the matter. The president seems to be wishing the newspaper had kept its initial, misleading headline. Continuing to reject responsibility for how his own rhetoric has intensified anti-immigrant animus in America, Trump was on Twitter this morning trying to redirect focus away from the white nationalist El Paso shooter and toward the Dayton shooter. A Twitter account seemingly connected to the Dayton shooter does identify him as a \u201cleftist\u201d and a supporter of Elizabeth Warren. But the FBI said yesterday that investigators have uncovered no evidence of a racial motivation in the Dayton attack, even though the shooter seems to have explored \u201cviolent ideologies.\u201d In contrast, the El Paso shooter posted an anti-immigrant screed online before targeting a city with a large Hispanic community. The shooter\u2019s language of trying to prevent a Hispanic \u201cinvasion\u201d also reflects the rhetoric of Trump, whose re-election campaign has paid for thousands of Facebook ads that use similar language. In a statement yesterday, Warren\u2019s campaign criticized efforts by Trump and his supporters to connect her to the Dayton attack as an \u201cattempt to distract\u201d from the \u201cdirect line\u201d between the president\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and the El Paso shooter. \u201cThere is absolutely no place for violence in our politics and Elizabeth and our campaign condemn it in the strongest possible terms,\u201d Kristen Orthman, a spokesperson for the Warren campaign, said. \u201cLeaders have a responsibility to speak out and to not incite violence. But let\u2019s be clear \u2013 there is a direct line between the president\u2019s rhetoric and the stated motivations of the El Paso shooter. This is an attempt to distract from the fact that Trump\u2019s rhetoric is inciting violence as extremist-related murders have spiked 35 percent from 2017 to 2018.\u201d Good morning, live blog readers! Joe Biden is set to give a speech today condemning Donald Trump in the former vice-president\u2019s strongest terms yet. Following the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Biden will tell an audience in Burlington, Iowa, this afternoon that Trump \u201chas fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation\u201d, Axios reports. \u201cHow far is it from Trump\u2019s saying this \u2018is an invasion\u2019 to the shooter in El Paso declaring \u2018his attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas?\u2019 Not far at all,\u201d Biden will say. \u201cHow far is it from the white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville \u2013 Trump\u2019s \u2018very fine people,\u2019 chanting \u2018You will not replace us\u2019 \u2013 to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh saying Jews \u2018were committing genocide to his people?\u2019 Not far at all \u2026 In both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation.\u201d The condemnation is a noticeable shift for Biden, who avoided sweeping judgments about Trump\u2019s own ideology in a CNN interview earlier this week. \u201cClearly, his actions have done nothing to do anything other than encourage this kind of behavior,\u201d the presidential candidate told Anderson Cooper. But with other 2020 Democrats calling out the president by name for intensifying racism in the country, Biden has probably felt pressure to do the same, particularly given that he launched his campaign on the premise that Trump represented a fundamental threat to \u201cthe soul of this nation.\u201d Trump has repeatedly signaled that he wants the 2020 election to focus on issues of race and identity in America. His Democratic rivals now seem to be coalescing around a unified response: bring it on. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: The president will travel to El Paso and Dayton with the first lady to meet with first responders and victims of this weekend\u2019s two mass shootings. Representative Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the House oversight committee, will speak to the National Press Club at 1pm EDT. He is sure to be asked about Trump\u2019s racist tweets directed at Cummings and his majority-black district in Baltimore. (Watch it here.) Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker will deliver remarks on gun violence and white nationalism at 9.30am EDT. The speech will take place at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, the site of the 2015 white supremacist that left nine African American parishioners dead. (Watch his remarks here.) That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Concern is growing that New Zealand\u2019s royal inquiry into the Christchurch massacre is lacking teeth and transparency with survivors, the media and security experts raising red flags. On 15 March a lone gunmen killed 51 people in a white supremacist-inspired attack at two inner-city Christchurch mosques. Prosecutors say the massacre was livestreamed by the Australian-born shooter, Brenton Tarrant, and is the biggest mass murder in New Zealand\u2019s modern history. Jacinda Ardern announced a royal commission of inquiry would be held to ascertain what could have been done to prevent the tragedy, particularly by the security and intelligence sector, who said the killer was not known to them, or Australian authorities. No stone would be left unturned to establish the truth, she said, and ensure that such an attack could never happen again. But frustration is growing at the inquiry\u2019s lack of transparency. Survivors say they feel overlooked and shut out of the investigative process, while media are also unable to report freely because of restrictions imposed for national security reasons. The Muslim community was not consulted on the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference, and many say the investigation is unduly opaque and lacks respect for the community\u2019s fears of further persecution in New Zealand. \u201cWe were ignored,\u201d Aliya Danzeisen of the Islamic Women\u2019s Council told Newsroom. \u201cIt makes it more challenging for an already challenged community.\u201d Geopolitical and strategic risk expert Paul Buchanan, who has been interviewed by the royal inquiry, said it was little more than \u201cwindow-dressing\u201d, adding that it was also failing in its attempt to reassure the public that everything was being looked into. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that they can\u2019t really do much until the trial [of Tarrant] begins and evidence is presented in court,\u201d said Buchanan. \u201cIt has hamstrung some of their investigations because they can see the evidence but they\u2019re not allowed to speak about it. I said to them what is the point of having a royal commission if you can\u2019t address the real issues? And they seem to be aware of that.\u201d New Zealand journalists have also raised concerns that the government will not adequately be held to account as media are not able to attend hearings, view or read interviews or transcripts or cite evidence and submissions. One Christchurch-based journalist described the inquiry as a \u201cblack box\u201d. \u201cThe only information we can get from the commission is the information they put out,\u201d said RNZ reporter Katie Scotcher. Wide-ranging suppression orders have also raised questions from the Human Rights Commission, with New Zealand\u2019s chief human rights commissioner Paul Hunt saying it was important that justice was not only done, but seen to be done. Earlier this year former race relations commissioner Joris De Bres refused to meet the inquiry, citing concerns for Muslim inclusivity in the process. The inquiry has been tasked with exploring the killer\u2019s activities in New Zealand, Australia and internationally, his use of social media, his connections, and what state sector agencies knew or should have known about his plans. Ardern said the inquiry would also investigate whether state sector agencies had \u201cinappropriate concentration or priority setting of counter-terrorism resources\u201d \u2013 such as focusing overly on jihadists threats and ignoring the extreme rightwing element emerging in New Zealand and on the global stage. The inquiry is expected to report back to the governor general Dame Patsy Reddy by 10 December. A spokesperson for the royal commission said the investigation had been \u201cmeticulous and rigorous\u201d in requiring gvoernment agencies to answer \u201cdirect and probing questions\u201d. Regular updates about the hearings were posted on its website. \u201cWe appreciate this will not satisfy all interests, but we must manage the work of the royal commission with the utmost care to protect the integrity of the process,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
