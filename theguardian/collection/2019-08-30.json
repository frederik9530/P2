I attended a comprehensive school in Bristol; my eldest brother, Tariq, had left school at 16 and gone straight into work. Nobody in my family had attended university. But then I started hearing about university from my cousin it sounded pretty appealing, and I wanted to keep my options open.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Charles didn\u2019t just teach economics, he ignited my desire to go to university \u2013 and gave me the confidence to do so</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My brother had returned to education as a mature student at the same college to do a BTEC qualification and my second eldest brother, Khalid, went straight there from school. That\u2019s how I heard about it. And unlike my school sixth form, Filton said I could study three A-levels, promising me success if I put the work in. If I\u2019d not had that opportunity to study economics, maths and computer science, I doubt I would have had the honour of becoming chancellor, or the chance to pursue a career in business that took me all over the world.</p> <p>It was at college I met the first of my great mentors \u2013 Mr Stamboulieh, or Charles to his students. He didn\u2019t just teach economics, he ignited my desire to go to university to study economics \u2013 and gave me the confidence to know I could do so.</p> <p>The challenges facing young people today are different to those I faced: they will enter working life as technology revolutionises the face of industry and with emerging economies changing the global economy. Those changes have made FE colleges more important than ever to the life-opportunities of our young people. Many of them will work in entirely new industries, such as preventing and mitigating climate change, and many more will work in fields we have not even thought of yet.</p> <p>As Britain leaves the EU on 31 October good colleges are vital to develop the skills and training necessary to help our young people on the road to a brighter future. To deliver on that in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45b2b6ac-c986-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\" title=\"\">spending round</a> next week I am going to invest a further \u00a3400 million in education for 16- to 19-year-olds next year \u2013 the biggest increase for a decade.</p> <p>It will mean we can support the delivery of the new T-Level qualifications rolling out in September 2020. These two-year courses, in subjects as varied as accounting, digital production and construction, will change the face of vocational education in this country. We\u2019ll also be able to spend more on expensive courses including vital STEM subjects. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics open the door to well-paid jobs. It will mean more students becoming eligible for the advanced maths premium, adding \u00a3600 to college budgets for every additional student who takes on A- and AS-level maths. And it will also mean more investment in the inspiring teachers we need to fuel the dreams and aspirations of pupils \u2013 and to change lives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/21/government-exceed-budget-target-this-year-extra-spending\">Government likely to exceed budget target by \u00a38bn this year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most importantly I want this investment to start to end the snobbishness in some quarters about the quality and importance of a vocational education. It was a FE college that equipped me with the qualifications needed to pursue my ambitions. And my two brothers who preceded me into college show that people who use their hands as well as their heads can use their qualifications to become incredibly successful in terms of jobs and financial security.</p> <p>When we look ahead to our economic and productivity challenges, further education will be vitally important to train and teach our young people in the skills they need for modern businesses. From engineering and IT to creative industries, it will be technical ability that will be crucial for many of our future generations to access higher wage jobs. Look at other countries and you don\u2019t see this problem. In Germany, if you go to college or you do an apprenticeship, that is viewed as highly as going to university.</p> <p>Further education, like all our public services, is a lifeline of opportunity for our young people. We\u2019ll make a strong statement in backing it at next week\u2019s spending round and I\u2019ll continue to look at what more we can do to help, just as my FE college opened my horizons and set me on my way.

It was at college I met the first of my great mentors \u2013 Mr Stamboulieh, or Charles to his students. He didn\u2019t just teach economics, he ignited my desire to go to university to study economics \u2013 and gave me the confidence to know I could do so. The challenges facing young people today are different to those I faced: they will enter working life as technology revolutionises the face of industry and with emerging economies changing the global economy. Those changes have made FE colleges more important than ever to the life-opportunities of our young people. Many of them will work in entirely new industries, such as preventing and mitigating climate change, and many more will work in fields we have not even thought of yet. As Britain leaves the EU on 31 October good colleges are vital to develop the skills and training necessary to help our young people on the road to a brighter future. To deliver on that in the spending round next week I am going to invest a further \u00a3400 million in education for 16- to 19-year-olds next year \u2013 the biggest increase for a decade. It will mean we can support the delivery of the new T-Level qualifications rolling out in September 2020. These two-year courses, in subjects as varied as accounting, digital production and construction, will change the face of vocational education in this country. We\u2019ll also be able to spend more on expensive courses including vital STEM subjects. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics open the door to well-paid jobs. It will mean more students becoming eligible for the advanced maths premium, adding \u00a3600 to college budgets for every additional student who takes on A- and AS-level maths. And it will also mean more investment in the inspiring teachers we need to fuel the dreams and aspirations of pupils \u2013 and to change lives. Most importantly I want this investment to start to end the snobbishness in some quarters about the quality and importance of a vocational education. It was a FE college that equipped me with the qualifications needed to pursue my ambitions. And my two brothers who preceded me into college show that people who use their hands as well as their heads can use their qualifications to become incredibly successful in terms of jobs and financial security. When we look ahead to our economic and productivity challenges, further education will be vitally important to train and teach our young people in the skills they need for modern businesses. From engineering and IT to creative industries, it will be technical ability that will be crucial for many of our future generations to access higher wage jobs. Look at other countries and you don\u2019t see this problem. In Germany, if you go to college or you do an apprenticeship, that is viewed as highly as going to university. Further education, like all our public services, is a lifeline of opportunity for our young people. We\u2019ll make a strong statement in backing it at next week\u2019s spending round and I\u2019ll continue to look at what more we can do to help, just as my FE college opened my horizons and set me on my way. Thank you, Charles. \u2022 Sajid Javid is the chancellor",

      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid is poised to break his first promise as chancellor by raising government borrowing above limits set in the Conservative manifesto, a leading thinktank has said. The Resolution Foundation said before Javid\u2019s spending review next week that he stood to break his fiscal rules governing how much the country should borrow by ramping up spending in the runup to Brexit. The chancellor, in a move that has stoked intense speculation of a snap election, would use a spending round announcement on Wednesday to meet the pledges made by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, for higher spending on health, schools and police. Although Javid promised this week to stick to the borrowing rules devised by his predecessor, Philip Hammond, the thinktank said a UK economy teetering on the brink of recession had damaged the public finances, dramatically cutting his room for manoeuvre within those constraints. Hammond set four fiscal rules to be policed by the government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which were part of the Conservative manifesto when Theresa May was prime minister. As the party committed to cutting the deficit \u2013 the gap between government spending and income from taxes \u2013 the rules bind Javid to keep public debt falling as a percentage of GDP and to ensure borrowing adjusted for the state of the economy is below 2% of GDP in 2020-21. The public finances should be balanced by the middle of the next decade, while the amount spent on welfare must also remain below a specific cash limit \u2013 currently \u00a3135bn. The Resolution Foundation, basing its figures on the most recently available forecasts on the state of the economy and the public finances made by the OBR in March, said Javid had enough room to raise spending by about \u00a314bn in the round. Critics have said the chancellor could avoid scrutiny by using the forecasts made earlier this year. The OBR should produce forecasts twice a year, although it would only publish its latest assessments alongside the next budget, the date of which is yet to be confirmed by Javid. The UK economy has stalled over the summer as global growth falters and Brexit uncertainty weighs on the country, denting the strength of the public finances. Public borrowing has also gradually started rising as Whitehall departments have had to spend more money on staff wages in recent months as they stepped up hiring in preparation for leaving the EU. The Resolution Foundation said both factors had cut Javid\u2019s spending headroom down to about \u00a34bn for next year. The thinktank said the prime minister\u2019s existing promises made since entering No 10 were worth about \u00a36bn next year, while there are expectations for further spending announcements next week, as well as tax cuts in future that would smash apart the fiscal rules. Economists said that the UK has room to raise spending on public services after 10 years of austerity, as government borrowing costs are at historically low levels. The government has also cut the deficit to the lowest level in 17 years. The Resolution Foundation said the government could afford to raise its borrowing levels to boost public spending, but added that if Javid broke the fiscal rules then the UK\u2019s international credibility would be tarnished at a time when it was already looking likely to leave the EU without a deal. Several economists have urged the government to change its fiscal rules in recent months to reflect the need to raise spending on services hit by austerity. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cNext week\u2019s spending round will mark the end of a decade of spending cuts that have dominated political and economic debates. With the deficit now at a 17-year low, the chancellor can clearly afford to borrow more to spend on public services. \u201cBut it is far less clear that he can afford to undermine economic credibility by professing to be bound by fiscal rules that are likely to be inconsistent with the scale of spending rises and tax cuts being planned.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The government has announced a \u00a314bn cash injection over three years for England\u2019s schools, setting out a key aspect of the chancellor\u2019s plans before next Wednesday\u2019s spending review.</p> <p>The funding boost is in line with the new education strategy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/27/leaked-documents-reveal-tories-dramatic-plans-for-schools\">leaked to the Guardian</a> this week, with \u00a32.6bn for schools in 2020/21, compared with \u00a32.8bn in the draft document. The additional funding will increase to \u00a34.8bn in 2021-22 and \u00a37.1bn in 2022-23.</p> <p>The chancellor, Sajid Javid, will also place the focus in next Wednesday\u2019s spending review on starting to reverse the longtime underfunding of further education colleges.</p> <p>Javid, who himself attended an FE college, will announce a \u00a3400m injection into 16-19 education next year, which he said was the biggest increase for a decade.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/30/fe-college-chancellor-young-people-skills-sajid-javid\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Javid said: \u201cI want this investment to start to end the snobbishness in some quarters about the quality and importance of a vocational education. It was a FE college that equipped me with the qualifications needed to pursue my ambitions.\u201d</p> <p>While Javid has insisted there will be no blank cheque for any government department, schools funding is widely regarded as a pressing priority and a chance for Boris Johnson to show that his government will drop the austerity policies of its predecessors.</p> <p>Johnson said: \u201cWhen I became prime minister at the start of the summer, I promised to make sure every child receives a superb education regardless of which school they attend or where they grew up. Today I can announce the first step in delivering on that pledge: funding per pupil in primary and secondary schools will increase and be levelled up across the entire country.\u201d</p> <p>Jules White, a headteacher who launched the Worth Less? campaign by school leaders for higher funding, said schools in England would need to see how much they would receive in real terms before passing judgment.</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear that the major funding crisis that has blighted schools and post-16 provision is now being taken seriously by the government,\u201d White said. \u201cBut while the government\u2019s headline figure is for \u00a314bn, the actual increase in total spending on schools may be half of this, at \u00a37.1bn. We also need to know how our real-terms spending power will be affected by rising student numbers and other inflationary costs.\u201d</p> <p>The government said per-pupil funding would rise at least in line with inflation.

      "bodyText": "The government has announced a \u00a314bn cash injection over three years for England\u2019s schools, setting out a key aspect of the chancellor\u2019s plans before next Wednesday\u2019s spending review. The funding boost is in line with the new education strategy leaked to the Guardian this week, with \u00a32.6bn for schools in 2020/21, compared with \u00a32.8bn in the draft document. The additional funding will increase to \u00a34.8bn in 2021-22 and \u00a37.1bn in 2022-23. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, will also place the focus in next Wednesday\u2019s spending review on starting to reverse the longtime underfunding of further education colleges. Javid, who himself attended an FE college, will announce a \u00a3400m injection into 16-19 education next year, which he said was the biggest increase for a decade. Writing in the Guardian, Javid said: \u201cI want this investment to start to end the snobbishness in some quarters about the quality and importance of a vocational education. It was a FE college that equipped me with the qualifications needed to pursue my ambitions.\u201d While Javid has insisted there will be no blank cheque for any government department, schools funding is widely regarded as a pressing priority and a chance for Boris Johnson to show that his government will drop the austerity policies of its predecessors. Johnson said: \u201cWhen I became prime minister at the start of the summer, I promised to make sure every child receives a superb education regardless of which school they attend or where they grew up. Today I can announce the first step in delivering on that pledge: funding per pupil in primary and secondary schools will increase and be levelled up across the entire country.\u201d Jules White, a headteacher who launched the Worth Less? campaign by school leaders for higher funding, said schools in England would need to see how much they would receive in real terms before passing judgment. \u201cIt is clear that the major funding crisis that has blighted schools and post-16 provision is now being taken seriously by the government,\u201d White said. \u201cBut while the government\u2019s headline figure is for \u00a314bn, the actual increase in total spending on schools may be half of this, at \u00a37.1bn. We also need to know how our real-terms spending power will be affected by rising student numbers and other inflationary costs.\u201d The government said per-pupil funding would rise at least in line with inflation. Labour said the increase would not be sufficient to reverse long-term spending cuts. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cThis comes nowhere close to meeting the prime minister\u2019s pledge to reverse the Tories\u2019 education cuts, let alone matching Labour\u2019s plans to invest in a national education service. Instead it is yet another con trick by a politician who has shown time and again that you just can\u2019t trust his promises.\u201d Johnson has made schools funding one of his key domestic priorities. A nationwide backlash against school funding cuts became one of the key difficulties for many Conservatives in the 2017 general election, with many MPs reporting back to Downing Street that they had not anticipated the level of anger they encountered. Theresa May hoped to announce a new education funding settlement in the final days of her administration, but the plan was vetoed by her chancellor, Philip Hammond, who was cautious about opening the spending taps while a no-deal Brexit remained a possibility.

In 2017 a female politician was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/24/japanese-politicians-force-colleague-baby-leave-chamber-women\">forced to leave the chamber</a> in Japan after her colleagues objected to the presence of her seven-month-old child.</p> \n<p>But the Beehive has seen the birth of 12 babies to MPs in two years, prompting Mallard to rethink rules regarding infants in the house.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have been in parliament a long time and I have seen younger members struggle with the dilemma; especially of being mothers here,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Mallard recalls the experience of Greens MP Holly Walker, who wrote a book about the stress of working in parliament and having a child. Walker left parliament in 2014 suffering from burnout, anxiety and post-natal depression. Recently Walker had her second child \u2013 and Mallard appeared on the doorstep with containers of pasta bake.</p> \n<p>He says with MPs working 80 to 120 hours a week; it can be hard figuring out where families fit in. \u201cI thought to myself \u2018this cannot continue\u2019,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Among those benefiting from the child-friendly policy is prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-prime-minister-birth-baby-girl\">gave birth to daughter Neve in 2018</a>.

This is a privilege he would like to see extended to more MPs with families in regional centres.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really important.

In 2017 a female politician was forced to leave the chamber in Japan after her colleagues objected to the presence of her seven-month-old child. But the Beehive has seen the birth of 12 babies to MPs in two years, prompting Mallard to rethink rules regarding infants in the house. \u201cI have been in parliament a long time and I have seen younger members struggle with the dilemma; especially of being mothers here,\u201d he says. Mallard recalls the experience of Greens MP Holly Walker, who wrote a book about the stress of working in parliament and having a child. Walker left parliament in 2014 suffering from burnout, anxiety and post-natal depression. Recently Walker had her second child \u2013 and Mallard appeared on the doorstep with containers of pasta bake. He says with MPs working 80 to 120 hours a week; it can be hard figuring out where families fit in. \u201cI thought to myself \u2018this cannot continue\u2019,\u201d he says. Among those benefiting from the child-friendly policy is prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who gave birth to daughter Neve in 2018. Neve frequently accompanies her mother to work \u2013 usually with her father Clarke Gayford in tow \u2013 and a small nursery and changing facilities were installed for her in what was previously a tea room in the PM\u2019s ninth-floor office. Labour MP T\u0101mati Coffey is the newest father in parliament, and has just returned from six weeks of parental leave with his partner Tim. His seven-week old son T\u016bt\u0101nekai was the young infant being fed on Mallard\u2019s lap last week. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure there was a bit of baby vomit on the speaker\u2019s gown ... when he went to go and burp him more than a bit of air came up \u2013 but that was cool,\u201d says Coffey, who praised the speaker as \u201cso hands on\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been really lovely to have colleagues rallying around us at this time. Parliament can be quite a stoic, cold place and actually having babies around really softens the whole environment and softens the people and the energy in parliament as well.\u201d Coffey, who lives in Rotorua, has been granted leave by the speaker on Thursday afternoons so he can catch the last flight home to be with his young family. This is a privilege he would like to see extended to more MPs with families in regional centres. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important. Yeah we go to Wellington and we do the hard yards, but we\u2019re also family people and we need to encourage that balance.\u2019\u201d Dave Wills, manager of buildings and safety at parliament house, is overseeing the construction of a children\u2019s playground on parliament\u2019s front lawn, and planning an overhaul of the main family room; now shared by MPs and parliamentary staff. Better changing and breast-pumping facilities are also in the pipeline, and a veggie patch for local children has been planted on the speaker\u2019s lawn. When a rabbit ate the vegetables recently, parliamentary staff secretly replanted the patch, Wills says. Children are also welcome in the indoor swimming pool, and Wills says the aqua aerobics class at lunchtime is popular with new parents. The only place children are not allowed, says Wills, are \u201cthe special security rooms that every government has to have\u201d. Child-friendly changes extend to allowing MPs easier access to leave if they have a childcare emergency \u2013 even if important legislation is being debated in the house. \u201c[Post election] we intentionally placed new parents closer to suitable facilities so they had things like ensuites and shower and toilet facilities and slightly roomier offices than what other people have,\u201d Wills says. \u201cThe atmosphere is lighter somehow \u2013 it does feel quite welcoming now. And people certainly feel a bit more empowered.\u201d But for Mallard there is more to be done. At present, only messengers are allowed to carry infants into the house, and Mallard would like carers to also have that ability, particularly if a child is anxious or clingy. Opposition to the changes remains from some MPs, Mallard says, but in his opinion, they are out of touch. \u201cThe world is changing. It takes some people a bit longer to understand the direction it\u2019s going.\u201d",

He was very much in control of the second-set tie-break and made things much harder than they needed to be. Will the same happen here? Lorenzi takes two points on serve for 5-4, to at least keep the pressure on Wawrinka, who has the next two balls to put this match away. An ace makes it two match points after nearly three hours. And they\u2019ve only played three sets. Another snarling serve and Wawrinka ends the run of the lucky loser \u2013 but that was anything but easy. Novak Djokovic, who\u2019s coming up in the night session along with Elina Svitolina, Sofia Kenin v Madison Keys and Daniil Medvedev v Feliciano Lopez, could be next for Wawrinka. Though apparently Djokovic has yet to practice today as concerns over his shoulder injury persist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/scambers73/status/1167564835669839879\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hard-earned win for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stanwawrinka?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@stanwawrinka</a> over Paolo Lorenzi, first time into the fourth round at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/usopen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@usopen</a> since he won it in 2016</p>&mdash; Simon Cambers (@scambers73) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scambers73/status/1167564835669839879?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T22:38:33.891Z\">at 11.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d69a1958f081c5d7489d1cf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T22:25:24.456Z\">11.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lorenzi bizarrely bashes himself in the face with three balls as he prepares to serve at 2-1 down.

Both players are attempting to reach the last 16 of a major for the first time, an achievement that would be especially poignant for Wang after the death of her former coach Peter McNamara this month.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d6988148f081c5d7489d132\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T20:42:54.622Z\">9.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Talking of the women\u2019s title favourites, five days in, who\u2019s your tip?</strong> Will Williams finally claim that elusive 24th slam?

While Federer has collected 20 grand slams, 102 titles and $126m in prize money in an unrivalled and unbroken 21-year career, Evans, the 29-year-old British No 2 who returned to tennis last summer after a 12-month ban for a positive cocaine test, has never won an ATP tournament, has reached the fourth round of a major once and has career earnings totalling only 1% of Federer\u2019s.</p> <p>But these two have more in common than you think. After Evans pushed Federer in three tight sets at the Australian Open this year, Federer said it was like \u201cplaying in the mirror a little bit\u201d and invited Evans to practice with him in Switzerland before the French Open.</p> <p>\u201cWe talked about everything really,\u201d says Evans, or \u201cDanny\u201d as he\u2019s now called by the GOAT. \u201cHe was pretty open about life, what he does. Just open, normal chat. I didn\u2019t ask him about my game.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go about my business and hopefully beat him. I have to think I can beat him otherwise there is no point. Since the first time I played him [at Wimbledon in 2016, their only other meeting] I think I am in a different place and he\u2019s probably in a different place. I think I have got over: \u2018It\u2019s Roger and he\u2019s impossible to beat.\u2019 I have more belief going onto court.\u201d<br></p> <p>The unlikely pair will continue their bromance in the first match on Arthur Ashe, on a day when another GOAT and another Brit are also in third-round action. Serena Williams, after two consecutive night matches, gets her first taste of daylight, against the unseeded Czech Karolina Muchova, while Johanna Konta, after marmalising Margarita Gasparyan 6-1, 6-0 yesterday for the most comprehensive grand slam victory of her career, meets China\u2019s world No 34, Zhang Shuai.<br></p> <p>Ashleigh Barty, Karolina Pliskova, Stan Wawrinka and Grigor Dimitrov also play in the day session, while Kei Nishikori could find himself in a right old scrap against the young Aussie battler Alex de Minaur. Then this evening it\u2019s Novak Djokovic (as long as he removes himself from the freezer he said he wanted to put his sore shoulder in for two days straight), Elina Svitolina, Sofia Kenin v Madison Keys in the battle of the in-form Americans, and Daniil Medvedev against the wily old Spaniard Feliciano Lopez, who\u2019s appearing in his 71st consecutive slam. So Evans take heart: Federer isn\u2019t quite the best at everything. <br></p> <p><strong>Play begins at:</strong> 11am local time/4pm BST except for on Arthur Ashe, which starts at 12pm/5pm. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T14:53:03.012Z\">at 3.53pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from the blog for today, thanks for your company. Be sure to check back for reports on the late action. Bye! ... which Wawrinka turns into 5-2. He was very much in control of the second-set tie-break and made things much harder than they needed to be. Will the same happen here? Lorenzi takes two points on serve for 5-4, to at least keep the pressure on Wawrinka, who has the next two balls to put this match away. An ace makes it two match points after nearly three hours. And they\u2019ve only played three sets. Another snarling serve and Wawrinka ends the run of the lucky loser \u2013 but that was anything but easy. Novak Djokovic, who\u2019s coming up in the night session along with Elina Svitolina, Sofia Kenin v Madison Keys and Daniil Medvedev v Feliciano Lopez, could be next for Wawrinka. Though apparently Djokovic has yet to practice today as concerns over his shoulder injury persist. Lorenzi bizarrely bashes himself in the face with three balls as he prepares to serve at 2-1 down. Whatever he was trying to do, it doesn\u2019t work, because he promptly falls 3-1 behind. But Wawrinka is feeling charitable and misses with a backhand he should have made, his 48th unforced error. 3-2 ... Kyrgios and Copil have beaten Skupski and Daniell in the first round of the men\u2019s doubles, 6-7 (5), 7-5, 7-6 (1), just as Lorenzi holds for 6-5. Wawrinka is then called for a foot fault, just to rub salt into the Swiss\u2019s wounds, but he brushes it off and shows wonderful hands at the net to win the point. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. It\u2019s time for another tie-break, Wawrinka will hope it\u2019s slightly more straightforward than the first ... This is draining just to watch ... Wawrinka is scratching his head after conceding the opening point. 0-15. A poor miss from Lorenzi and it\u2019s 15-all. Lorenzi nets again for 30-15. Wawrinka doubles for 30-all. An error-strewn game from both players. But Lorenzi whips a forehand return winner and it\u2019s break point! Wawrinka is bamboozled by Lorenzi\u2019s shanked shot and Wawrinka is broken while serving for the match! It\u2019s 5-5. Come on Stan, some of us are due to be finishing work now ... There have been plenty of break points in this third set \u2013 five for Lorenzi, two for Wawrinka (Lorenzi\u2019s converted only one out of 12 in the match overall) \u2013 but they\u2019re still on serve at 4-4. Lorenzi then sends down his first double fault of the match at completely the wrong time to give Wawrinka two more break points. 15-40. That backhand from Wawrinka gets the job done and he\u2019s now just a game away from the last 16. With Lorenzi\u2019s legs looking heavy, Wawrinka has two break points at 2-2 in the third. But the Italian\u2019s heart is still strong. He saves both and recovers to deuce. Lorenzi isn\u2019t the only lucky loser in action because Poland\u2019s Kamil Majchrzak is just under way against the forgotten man Grigor Dimitrov, who\u2019s had an awful year. Meanwhile the other remaining singles match of the day session is also getting started, with the 17th seed, Nikoloz Basilashvili, up against the German qualifier Dominik Koepfer. Both defeated home hopes in Jenson Brooksby and Reilly Opelka in the previous round, so probably don\u2019t have too many backers on Grandstand. Federer and Williams\u2019s speedy wins on Arthur Ashe earlier mean the men\u2019s doubles match involving Nick Kyrgios has been moved there, and he\u2019s just pulled off a quite ridiculous angled winner while moving into the net to secure the second set 7-5, alongside his partner Marius Copil of Romania. Britain\u2019s Ken Skupski and Marcus Daniell of New Zealand won the first 7-6 (5). After three matches in qualifying, followed by two five-setters to get to the third round, how much will Lorenzi have left in the tank here? He\u2019s just one of three 37-year-olds playing in the men\u2019s singles today, by the way, what with Federer trouncing Dan Evans earlier (and then getting uncharacteristically sweary) and Feliciano Lopez coming up in the night session against Daniil Medvedev. Federer now knows he\u2019ll face David Goffin in the fourth round, because the 15th seed has come through in straight sets that were anything but straightforward, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (9), 7-5 against Pablo Carreno Busta. ... Wawrinka tees up a fourth set point on his serve, but this one also vanishes, and then Lorenzi, the lucky loser remember, has a set point of his own at 8-7! This time Wawrinka keeps the set going, and edges 9-8 up. A fifth set point. The crowd gasp when Wawrinka\u2019s backhand clips the top of the tape and loops over ... Lorenzi isn\u2019t distracted and manages to bury the volley. 9-9. 10-9 Wawrinka, a sixth set point. Lorenzi finally surrenders when he slaps a backhand into the net and Wawrinka is a set away from a possible fourth-round meeting with Novak Djokovic, whom he beat in that 2016 final. Lorenzi at least takes the next point on his serve, but Wawrinka is allezing to himself after holding serve on the following two for 6-3. The first two set points are on Lorenzi\u2019s racket, and the Italian holds firm. But now Wawrinka is serving at 6-5. Up steps Stan, who\u2019s being backed strongly by the Louis Armstrong patrons, but Lorenzi pushes Wawrinka deep and out wide before skipping forward to plant a volley into the other corner. All three set points have come and gone ... Wawrinka, 3-1 ahead, thinks he\u2019s put away the forehand winner but Hawk-Eye confirms he slightly miscued, so they\u2019re back on serve. Will that miss come back to haunt the 23rd seed? Unlikely. Because Wawrinka immediately restores the mini-break and changes ends leading 4-2 ... Lorenzi, for the second time, is serving to stay in the second set, at 6-5 down. And that the Italian does, to 15. Though the highlight of the game was a trademark Wawrinka one-handed backhand winner. That shot never gets old. It\u2019s time for a tie-break ... David Goffin has saved three set points to lead Pablo Carreno Busta 7-6 (5), 7-6 (9). This is tortuous stuff. They\u2019ve been playing for more than two and a half hours on Court 17. As for Wawrinka, the second set has meandered along somewhat, but is starting to get serious as Wawrinka holds from deuce for 5-4. And in the other singles match currently on court, Fiona Ferro, who defeated Angelique Kerber\u2019s first-round conqueror Kristina Mladenovic in the second round, is into a first-set tie-break against Wang Qiang. Both players are attempting to reach the last 16 of a major for the first time, an achievement that would be especially poignant for Wang after the death of her former coach Peter McNamara this month. Talking of the women\u2019s title favourites, five days in, who\u2019s your tip? Will Williams finally claim that elusive 24th slam? Can Barty build on that French Open win? Can Konta break through into a major final? Will Osaka start playing like the world No 1 again \u2013 or will Coco Gauff make even bigger waves? And what of the in-form Bianca Andreescu, Madison Keys and Sofia Kenin? Do get in touch via email or Twitter. Let\u2019s talk! Navratilova also talked about Konta\u2019s win \u2013 \u201cShe played with clarity. It\u2019s an A-plus performance for me. It seems she\u2019s playing more by instinct\u201d \u2013 before saying of Williams\u2019s title chances: \u201cFor me it\u2019s always Serena Williams against the field. It\u2019s still the case, even more so because she\u2019s looking very comfortable and healthy. If she doesn\u2019t win it it\u2019s wide open, there could be 10 people.\u201d Speaking of Gauff, Martina Navratilova\u2019s been in the Amazon Prime studio and giving her thoughts on the prodigy: She\u2019s got the potential to be one of the greatest if she stays healthy. Everything is working for her. She\u2019s got the head, the heart, the passion and the game, which can only get better. I had to play for 10 years before I spoke as well as she does. She\u2019s well beyond her years. The Coco show is continuing today, not in the singles but the women\u2019s doubles. The teenage sensation has warmed up for her third-round blockbuster with the defending champion, Naomi Osaka, tomorrow by teaming up with another precocious American talent, Caty McNally, and coming back from 6-2 down in the first-set tie-break to beat the experienced partnership of Julia Goerges and Katerina Siniakova, 7-6 (6), 6-2. Gauff and McNally have played only two events together before, the 2018 US Open juniors and Washington this month, and they won both. Wawrinka takes advantage of Lorenzi\u2019s lack of prolifigacy to whizz to 0-40 and three set points on the Italian\u2019s serve. Wawrinka pings an inside-out forehand past Lorenzi\u2019s backhand wing and that\u2019s the set 6-4. This match is almost completely on the 2016 champion\u2019s racket. He\u2019s dictating the play with 20 winners and 16 unforced errors; Lorenzi has four and five respectively. Thanks Niall. Thankfully there was no dinner thievery tonight, so I\u2019m suitably sated. I return as Wawrinka is chuntering to himself in his chair about something, though I\u2019m not sure why he looks so unhappy given he\u2019s just repelled five break points to nudge 5-4 ahead. So Lorenzi, who should really be serving for the set, is instead serving to stay in it. Still a curious atmosphere on Armstrong, with both Lorenzi and Wawrinka himself a little confused that the Swiss avoided a warning for throwing his racket. Lorenzi falls 0-30 down, but rallies with four straight points to hold. And with that, it\u2019s back to Katy ... Wawrinka had been threatening, and promptly breaks his journeyman opponent in the sixth game \u2013 only to end up two break-points down himself in the next. The Swiss saves the first, but not the second, as he mishits a volley, before launching his racket at his chair. He then sheepishly asks the umpire if he\u2019d been given a warning (he hadn\u2019t). Elsewhere, David Goffin has won the first-set tie-break against Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta, a player whose name I can only read to the tune of \u201cAnother One Bites The Dust\u201d. Dan Evans has complained that a quick turnaround was partly to blame for his heavy defeat to Roger Federer: \u201cI was fatigued,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI thought it was pretty tough I was first up after playing yesterday, if I\u2019m being brutally honest. Him being totally fresh and me, you know, battling yesterday, I didn\u2019t get out of here until probably going on 6pm ... just complete polar opposites, isn\u2019t it? \u201cAnd to try to beat him feeling tired, stiff, playing four sets yesterday, it\u2019s near on impossible. But do you think a guy who\u2019s my ranking has any say in that? There are probably about four people in this tournament who have a say when they play. Maybe three.\u201d Federer, who played his second-round match under the roof on a rain-hit Wednesday, hit back at Evans\u2019 comments. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean like, \u2018Roger asks, Roger gets\u2019,\u201d Federer said. \u201cJust remember that, because I have heard this shit too often now. I\u2019m sick and tired of it, that apparently I call the shots. The tournament and the TV stations do. We can give our opinion. That\u2019s what we do. But I\u2019m still going to walk out even if they schedule me at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d On Louis Armstrong, 2016 champ Stan Wawrinka is in action against Italy\u2019s Paolo Lorenzi, who\u2019s hoping to match his best-ever US Open (and slam) performance by reaching the fourth round. 34-year-old Wawrinka is used to being the veteran, but he\u2019s actually three years younger than Lorenzi. Still on serve in the first set. Those three victories mean the bottom half of the women\u2019s fourth-round draw is taking shape. Konta will face the No 3 seed, Karolina Pliskova, next. Williams and Barty, meanwhile, are on course for a box-office quarter-final meeting. Konta cruises through her service game and then attacks the Zhang serve, aggressive returns helping her carve out a match point. Zhang saves the first, but Konta dominates the next rally \u2013 and seals victory as a Zhang forehand goes long! Over on Grandstand, Johanna Konta sees a break point, and a chance to go 5-2 up in the second, go begging as Zhang holds her serve. The No 16 seed still leads by a set and a break. Serena finishes off the job to win 6-3, 6-2. She tells courtside reporters she\u2019s happy with her performance, and looking forward to an evening off with her daughter after her afternoon win. She\u2019ll play Petra Martic next. Thanks Katy. I\u2019ve just had my dinner, since you ask \u2013 I found it in the fridge got the classic Friday fish and chips from the Guardian Towers canteen. Now time to judge some athletes! I\u2019m off to grab some food (that\u2019s if no one\u2019s stolen my dinner today), so I\u2019ll leave you in the very capable hands of Niall McVeigh ... Ashleigh Barty, who is looking to reassert herself after a mixed time of it since winning the French Open in June, has advanced in two tight sets against Maria Sakkari. Maria\u2019s an incredible competitor. It was important for me to try to dictate. It was tricky to play a friend but really happy with the way I closed out those sets. Nothing\u2019s changed [since winning the French Open]. I\u2019m still the same person. It hasn\u2019t changed the way I prepare or live my life. It was incredible journey in Paris, I loved every minute, but as soon as we come back over to America I can\u2019t wait to get to New York.\u201d but it hasn\u2019t changed the way There were so many questions about Williams\u2019s state of mind and body coming into this tournament but she\u2019s looking in good touch right now. From 3-3 in the first set, she\u2019s taken six games on the spin for 6-3, 3-0. Muchova has impressive variety but, as is so often the case for Williams\u2019s opponents, she can\u2019t quite match the 37-year-old for power. Konta is aiming to equal her best performance at Flushing Meadows by reaching the fourth round. This is the only grand slam where she\u2019s not yet reached the semi-finals. Can she change that this year? Of course she can. She has the talent, and by the looks of it the form too. But then sometimes she forgets how good she is and blows up. So much of it is in her head. A good omen for Konta: Konta is also close to a one-set lead, serving at 5-2 in front of a disappointingly sparse crowd on Grandstand. Though you probably can\u2019t blame the spectators for wanting to find a bit of shade after that near three-hour contest between Alex de Minaur and Kei Nishikori. Konta doesn\u2019t chose the best of moments to allow Zhang a first break point of the match at 30-40. Zhang leaves the court wide open by running around her backhand, allowing Konta to produce an easy forehand winner. Konta clubs another forehand winner on a second break point. And the British No 1 takes the set when Konta eclipses Zhang in a moonball exchange. But back to the real Serena Williams, who has upped the intensity on Ashe to break Muchova ... before dropping it and allowing her opponent a chance to break back. But Williams\u2019s trusty serve gets her out of trouble \u2013 is there a stronger shot in the women\u2019s game? \u2013 and she holds for 5-3. Williams decides she doesn\u2019t want to wait to serve this first set out, and charges to 0-30 on Muchova\u2019s serve, the second point won when she gobbles up a Muchova slice. Make that 0-40, three set points. Williams absolutely wallops a return winner that leaves Muchova rooted to the cement! Wow. After a competitive first half of the set, Williams walked away with that. The doubles events also get into full swing today after Wednesday\u2019s washout delayed so many matches. Dan Evans must recover quickly from his humbling by Roger Federer, because he teams up with Cameron Norrie later. And fans are currently fighting for a spot on Court 5, where Coco Gauff and Caty McNally are getting under way in the women\u2019s doubles. Qualifying for the junior events begins too, with plenty of fledgling Federers and wannabe Williamses looking to make a name for themselves. Last year\u2019s semi-finalist Anastasija Sevastova is out, beaten 6-4, 6-3 by Petra Martic, who awaits the winner of Williams v Muchova. That match hasn\u2019t quite caught fire yet, though Williams has had a couple more chances to break. It\u2019s 3-3. Konta is seeing the ball like a football right now but then just as I type that she hits a shot so wayward it\u2019s probably landed in Flushing Bay. The great commentator\u2019s curse. Zhang holds but Konta still seems so strong. She leads 2-1. Johanna Konta is under way on Grandstand against China\u2019s 33rd seed Zhang Shuai and continues where she left off in yesterday\u2019s 6-1, 6-0 destruction of Margarita Gasparyan with a blistering backhand return down the line for the break in the opening game. Wow. She couldn\u2019t have hit that ball any truer. The British No 1 then backs up the break with a love hold. She\u2019s looking inspired. Meanwhile Barty has served out the set for a 7-5 lead. Ashleigh Barty is in a battle on Louis Armstrong, where at the business end of the first set she\u2019s locked at 5-5 against Greece\u2019s Maria Sakkari. The second seed, in the style of a true champion, decides it\u2019s time to strike, stepping it up when she needs to to break to 15. The French Open winner will serve for the set. A double fault doesn\u2019t stop Muchova from holding in the opening game, and then Williams responds with a hold to 15 of her own. Williams is looking pretty pumped early on, and is striding purposefully around the court to show she means business. Some rasping returns from Williams help her carve out a break point chance in the third game. Muchova\u2019s serve dismisses the danger. Deuce. A wobbly Williams backhand into the net and it\u2019s Muchova\u2019s advantage. Muchova then pulls off the one-two punch to survive from break point down. Muchova leads 2-1. Even if it\u2019s a rain coat rather than a dressing gown it\u2019s still a bizarre choice of clothing given the unbroken sun overhead. But I digress. The six-times champion, who of course is still searching for that 24th grand slam title which would surely confirm her as the game\u2019s greatest, is up against Karolina Muchova, of whom there is, erm, much to like. The 23-year-old Czech is rising up the rankings, currently at 44 having started the year at 144, and reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals last month. Here comes Serena. After two night matches, it\u2019s her first taste of the day session this year. But she seems to have forgotten it\u2019s not nearly bedtime because she\u2019s wearing what looks a bit like a black dressing gown over her purple outfit. De Minaur breaks Nishikori to seal an impressive 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 win. This kid is going places. And given that his next opponent will be either Grigor Dimitrov, who\u2019s had a terrible year and only advanced to the third round courtesy of a walkover, or the world No 94 Kamil Majchrzak, he\u2019s got a fantastic chance of reaching the quarter-finals, where he could face a certain R Federer. Serena Williams will be up next on Ashe. The only two singles matches currently in progress involve two Australians. Ashleigh Barty, who dragged herself out of a deep hole in the first round before looking more assured in the second, has an early break against the 30th seed from Greece, Maria Sakkari, leading 3-1. And Alex de Minaur looks to have repelled Kei Nishikori\u2019s comeback. The young counterpuncher, who was once called \u201cthe future of tennis\u201d by Daniil Medvedev, is a game away from reaching the fourth round of a slam for the first time, leading 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 5-3. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s match report: That was Federer\u2019s best performance since letting it slip in that Wimbledon final against Novak Djokovic. So perhaps the hangover is easing. Here are his thoughts: Different opponent, different day. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the reason but I\u2019ve learned from my first two matches. I got my groove back. It was tricky with the sun, the shade and the heat. I got off to a good start and never looked back. It was a good performance. I played a tough one against him in Australia so I was expecting it to be more difficult. Danny\u2019s got the shots. I though he looked a bit tired from yesterday. Maybe not the physical element, just the mental side of things. Evans came agonisingly close to reaching the last 16 on his previous two third-round appearances here, almost ousting Tommy Robredo in 2013 and having a match point against Stan Wawrinka in 2016 before losing in five. But this is an entirely different story. Evans is broken for the seventh time ... and Federer completes the easiest of wins with a hold to 15 when Evans tugs his return wide. Evans is off court in double quick time, though he does smile to himself in the corridor. Or perhaps it was a grimace given that 79-minute shellacking. Federer, of course, soaks in the applause of the swooning crowd. News on tomorrow\u2019s order of play: Third set: Federer 6-2, 6-2, 4-1 Evans* (*denotes next server) Evans can\u2019t build on that minor victory, and is promptly broken when he double faults to trail 3-1. Meanwhile Kei Nishikori\u2019s fightback is in full swing. The seventh seed has taken the third set against Alex de Minaur to reduce his arrears to 6-2, 6-4, 2-6. Johanna Konta will follow on Grandstand, while Ashleigh Barty, the French Open champion, is warming up on Louis Armstrong following Pliskova\u2019s win. Federer holds for 4-1. Third set: Federer 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 Evans* (*denotes next server) Back on Ashe, Federer and Evans are sticking to the script. Federer holds. Federer breaks. But look here, Evans has won his first points on Federer\u2019s serve since the first set, breaking a run of 21 consecutive service points for Federer, and it\u2019s 15-40! Federer fends off the first break point with an ace. Then on the second, Federer, striking from well within the court, has Evans pegged far behind the baseline ... but nets! Evans breaks for the first time but it\u2019s likely to be a brief celebration for the battered Brit. Since the first set, very little has been straightforward for Pliskova, but she\u2019s in her serving groove here, and has two match points at 40-15. A big serve out wide ... and Pliskova goes back behind Jabeur to seal an unconvincing win. The former finalist will have to do better in the fourth round, where she could meet Konta. Elsewhere, Karolina Pliskova, the third seed, is close to coming through in a tortuous three sets on Louis Armstrong, where she\u2019s about to serve for the match against Ons Jabeur, leading 6-1, 4-6, 5-4. And over on Grandstand, Johanna Konta may have to wait a while longer to get on court, because Kei Nishikori is fighting back against Alex de Minaur, trailing 6-2, 6-4, but 4-2 up in the third. Federer is reading virtually every Evans serve and he does so again for 0-15. The 38-year-old shows the speed of an 18-year-old to double his advantage to 0-30. And a strong second serve is dismissively dealt with by Federer for 0-40. The second set is soon his when Evans\u2019s forehand flies long. Evans glances at his coaching box \u2013 not that he\u2019s got a coach right now after splitting with David Felgate, Tim Henman\u2019s former coach, before the tournament. He then mangles his racket at the changeover and gets a warning from the umpire for his efforts. Second set: Federer 6-2, 5-2 Evans* (*denotes next server) This is exhibition tennis from Federer on serve. Another game flies by in the blink of an eye. A ball boy holds an umbrella over Federer at the changeover to shield him from the sun. But the GOAT doesn\u2019t need any shade. He doesn\u2019t even sweat when he\u2019s being pushed, so he\u2019s not going to be perspiring today. A brief delay before Evans serves to stay in the set because of an issue with the number of balls they\u2019re playing with. That\u2019s about Federer\u2019s only problem right now. Second set: *Federer 6-2, 4-2 Evans (*denotes next server) Evans manages to take an early lead in his service game for the first time this set. 30-15. 40-15. But Federer flicks his wand and conjures up a backhand winner down the line. 40-30. Evans does at least hold from there, but at this stage this may be more about trying to keep the scoreline respectable than aiming any higher. Second set: Federer 6-2, 4-1 Evans* (*denotes next server) Bish. Bash. Bosh. Break. Four winners fly by Evans and Federer breaks to love, before backing it up with another four unanswered points. This is brutal. Second set: Federer 6-2, 2-1 Evans* (*denotes next server) Federer holds. But you already knew that, right? He\u2019s dropped only six points on serve so far. And an ominous stat for Evans: he\u2019s never taken a set off Federer before. That tight 7-6 (5), 7-6 (3), 6-3 defeat at the Australian Open this year was preceded by a 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 loss at Wimbledon in 2016. Second set: *Federer 6-2, 1-1 Evans (*denotes next server) This is getting painful for Evans. Yet another quicker-than-quick hold from Federer is followed by another assault on Evans\u2019s serve. 15-40, two break points for the first break of the second set. Evans saves the first. \u201cCOME ON, COME ON,\u201d the anguished Brit screams, as he attempts to rouse himself into action. It works. 30-40, deuce, advantage Evans. Game Evans, when he comes out on top in a quick exchange at the net. Alex de Minaur is well set for a place in the fourth round of a slam for the first time. The 20-year-old Australian is now two sets to the good, 6-2, 6-4, against the 2014 finalist Kei Nishikori. So you know what happens next right? A near-flawless Federer service game, followed by a perilous one for Evans, who slumps 0-30 down. Federer\u2019s won eight of the past 10 points and is looking good to seal the set with another break. 0-30 turns into 15-40, two set points. Evans resists on the first but his forehand lands several feet beyond the baseline on the second, and that\u2019s the first set wrapped up in 27 minutes. No wonder Federer counts Evans as a friend if this is the way matches between them go. More on the lucky loser poser: First set: *Federer 4-2 Evans (*denotes next server) Federer holds to 15. And with another Evans service game comes more break points, set up with a superb slice from Federer. There\u2019s no Houdini act for Evans this time, as Federer flicks the pass beyond the Brit. Federer is looking so much sharper than he did at the start of his matches in the opening two rounds \u2013 perhaps that scar tissue from his Wimbledon final defeat to Novak Djokovic is healing. Pliskova decides she\u2019s had enough of messing around and gets herself back on serve against Jabeur, who had those two set points at 5-2. But then Pliskova takes her eye off the ball once more, and Jabeur has another three set points. On the fifth one, she takes it for 1-6, 6-4. They\u2019re going the distance on Louis Armstrong, while on Grandstand, De Minaur still leads Nishikori by a set to love, 6-4. It\u2019s 4-4 in the second. First set: *Federer 2-2 Evans (*denotes next server) Federer, after another straightforward hold, is making inroads into Evans\u2019s serve. This is much better from Federer, whose Swiss timing was somewhat off in the first two rounds, when he went a set down in both matches. 0-15, 0-30, 0-40. Three break points. On the first, Evans cracks a forehand to Federer\u2019s forehand, another to Federer\u2019s backhand, decides to come in to the net, and rounds off a wonderfully constructed point with two excellent volleys. He shows superb hands at the net on the second break point too. And on the third Federer makes the error! Deuce. And from 0-40 down, Evans holds! Ons Jabeur, quite remarkably given the state of play only five games ago, has two set points to level her match against Karolina Pliskova, leading 5-2 in the second ... First set: *Federer 1-1 Evans (*denotes next server) We\u2019ll focus on this match now, with a quick glance around the grounds when possible. With Arthur Ashe almost half covered in shade despite the midday sun \u2013 temperatures are forecast to hit 32 today \u2013 Federer starts with an easy hold to 15. But Evans, determined to disprove my previous point that Federer does everything that bit better, opens by holding to love. This humble game-by-gamer eats her words. Part of Federer and Evans\u2019s bromance stems from the fact they both appreciate the artistic side of the game. And therein lies the problem for Evans. Because while he has similar attributes to Federer \u2013 an intelligent tennis brain, a one-handed backhand, a good slice and net play \u2013 Federer does all of those things just that bit better. OK, usually quite a lot better. Here comes Evans and his new best friend on to Arthur Ashe, a court Evans has never played on before. Evans is introduced to the crowd first, and gets his first glance of the biggest arena in tennis, as he squints up to the skies. Just to add to the occasion, Kobe Bryant is performing the coin toss. Chris Parker emails. \u201cIs Paolo Lorenzi\u2019s third round the furthest someone has gotten as a Lucky Loser in a Grand Slam? $131,000 prize difference between going out in the final qualifier and third round, lucky indeed.\u201d After scrambling around in the online history books, the best slam performance I can find is Dick Norman, who made the fourth round of Wimbledon as a lucky loser in 1995, and Stephane Robert, who reached the fourth round of the Australian Open in 2014. But any other advances on that gratefully received ... Pliskova is nowhere near the player she was in the first set and gives Jabeur not one, not two, not three, not four, but five chances to break. Jabeur just can\u2019t pull the trigger, but eventually she does. They\u2019re back on serve in the second set with Pliskova leading 6-1, 2-2. A tidy hold from the Tunisian, who has that right knee strapped, and she hobbles ahead, 3-2. But again she\u2019s calling for the trainer and she seems to suggest there\u2019s now something wrong with the other leg too. Roger Federer is in the house. He and Evans will be on Arthur Ashe in just over five minutes\u2019 time. The stands on Grandstand are nearing capacity with close to 40 minutes on the match clock, but the same cannot be said on Louis Armstrong, where a disappointing number of fans are watching Jabeur ailing and failing against Pliskova, who now leads 6-1, 2-1 with the break. Pliskova\u2019s level has dipped but Jabeur, who is still struggling with injury, has not been able to take advantage. Nishikori is on the board on Grandstand but still trails by a double break, with De Minaur serving for the first set at 5-2. Nishikori gives the Australian something to think about when he biffs a backhand winner down the line on the opening point. De Minaur then nets a Nishikori smash for 0-30. And soon it\u2019s 0-40. Two unreturned serves save the first two break points. Nishikori then goes long when he should really do better. Deuce. Advantage De Minaur. Game and set De Minaur 6-2, who got himself out of a big hole there. So often in the early rounds of slams Pliskova looks like a potential champion, before falling to unexpected defeats. To hit her with one of tennis\u2019s greatest backhanded compliments, she\u2019s one of the best players to have never won a major. Could this change this year? She\u2019s in a tricky section of the draw, and could face Johanna Konta next, with Elina Svitolina, Madison Keys and Sofia Kenin also lurking in her quarter. Jabeur is furious with herself when she gives the break straight back to Pliskova, who is now serving for the first set. Pliskova quickly has two set points at 40-15. On the first, Jabeur jabs a forehand into the tramlines, then chips her racket into the court and calls for the trainer. I think the trainer will have to give her something much stronger than some treatment to her right knee if Jabeur is to get back into this. Pliskova, as she did in the second round, looks formidable, leading by a set to love, 6-1. Good news for Juan Martin del Potro fans. The likeable and perennially unlucky Argentinian, who had yet another surgery in June, this time on a fractured right kneecap that forced him to miss the US Open, will be back in action next month: After a game lasting 10 minutes De Minaur finally claims the double break over Nishikori when he shows his tremendous speed to not only get to a forehand but fire it back for a cross-court winner. It\u2019s 3-0. And look here, Pliskova is break point down at 4-0, 30-40. A double fault from one of the finest servers in the women\u2019s game and the Czech won\u2019t be helping herself to a late-morning New York bagel. It\u2019s 4-1. That said, De Minaur has zipped into a 2-0 lead and has a break point to make it 3-0. Nishikori punches away the volley for deuce but De Minaur comes straight back at the seventh seed for a second break point. It\u2019s all going one way on Louis Armstrong too, where Pliskova is completely in control at 4-0, with Jabeur spraying the balls almost everywhere but into the court. Meanwhile on Grandstand it\u2019s Alex de Minaur v Kei Nishikori, in a match that could go on for hours. And hours. De Minaur, the Australian whippersnapper and scrapper, can battle with the best of them, much like his mentor Lleyton Hewitt, but can sometimes be outgunned. Nishikori, who reached the final back in 2014, has many talents but can also lack the weaponry to finish opponents off quickly. Pliskova is currently warming up on Louis Armstrong against Ons Jabeur of Tunisia. Jabeur is reaching for two firsts today: progressing to the fourth round of a slam and becoming the only Arab woman to have ever broken the top 50. If she can pull off an upset today she is assured of a place among the world\u2019s elite. Karolina Pliskova, the Czech third seed who\u2019s among the early runners and riders today, is talking on the telly. \u201cFor sure it\u2019s different to all the other tournaments. It\u2019s a little bit more fun here, so it\u2019s more relaxed for me. I\u2019m happy outside of the court which is most important, still enjoying my tennis, I\u2019ve changed a couple of coaches since [reaching the 2016 final], I think my game is improving. This year has been so far the best for me.\u201d (All local times, BST +5hrs) Arthur Ashe Stadium 12pm (3) Roger Federer (Swi) v Daniel Evans (Gbr), (8) Serena Williams (USA) v Karolina Muchova (Cze) 7pm (20) Sofia Kenin (USA) v (10) Madison Keys (USA), (1) Novak Djokovic (Ser) v Denis Kudla (USA) Louis Armstrong Stadium 11am Ons Jabeur (Tun) v (3) Karolina Pliskova (Cze), (30) Maria Sakkari (Gre) v (2) Ashleigh Barty (Aus), (23) Stan Wawrinka (Swi) v Paolo Lorenzi (Ita) 7pm (5) Elina Svitolina (Ukr) v (32) Dayana Yastremska (Ukr), Feliciano Lopez (Spa) v (5) Daniil Medvedev (Rus) Grandstand 11am Alex De Minaur (Aus) v (7) Kei Nishikori (Jpn), (16) Johanna Konta (Gbr) v (33) Shuai Zhang (Chn), Fiona Ferro (Fra) v (18) Qiang Wang (Chn), Dominik Koepfer (Ger) v (17) Nikoloz Basilashvili (Geo) Court 4 11am Madison Brengle (USA) &amp;

Maxime Cressy (USA) And some post-match viewing. What a courageous performance that was from Taylor Townsend yesterday against Simona Halep: Some post-match reading: Some pre-match reading: At first glance Roger Federer seems to exist in a different stratosphere to Dan Evans. While Federer has collected 20 grand slams, 102 titles and $126m in prize money in an unrivalled and unbroken 21-year career, Evans, the 29-year-old British No 2 who returned to tennis last summer after a 12-month ban for a positive cocaine test, has never won an ATP tournament, has reached the fourth round of a major once and has career earnings totalling only 1% of Federer\u2019s. But these two have more in common than you think. After Evans pushed Federer in three tight sets at the Australian Open this year, Federer said it was like \u201cplaying in the mirror a little bit\u201d and invited Evans to practice with him in Switzerland before the French Open. \u201cWe talked about everything really,\u201d says Evans, or \u201cDanny\u201d as he\u2019s now called by the GOAT. \u201cHe was pretty open about life, what he does. Just open, normal chat. I didn\u2019t ask him about my game. \u201cI have to go about my business and hopefully beat him. I have to think I can beat him otherwise there is no point. Since the first time I played him [at Wimbledon in 2016, their only other meeting] I think I am in a different place and he\u2019s probably in a different place. I think I have got over: \u2018It\u2019s Roger and he\u2019s impossible to beat.\u2019 I have more belief going onto court.\u201d The unlikely pair will continue their bromance in the first match on Arthur Ashe, on a day when another GOAT and another Brit are also in third-round action. Serena Williams, after two consecutive night matches, gets her first taste of daylight, against the unseeded Czech Karolina Muchova, while Johanna Konta, after marmalising Margarita Gasparyan 6-1, 6-0 yesterday for the most comprehensive grand slam victory of her career, meets China\u2019s world No 34, Zhang Shuai. Ashleigh Barty, Karolina Pliskova, Stan Wawrinka and Grigor Dimitrov also play in the day session, while Kei Nishikori could find himself in a right old scrap against the young Aussie battler Alex de Minaur. Then this evening it\u2019s Novak Djokovic (as long as he removes himself from the freezer he said he wanted to put his sore shoulder in for two days straight), Elina Svitolina, Sofia Kenin v Madison Keys in the battle of the in-form Americans, and Daniil Medvedev against the wily old Spaniard Feliciano Lopez, who\u2019s appearing in his 71st consecutive slam. So Evans take heart: Federer isn\u2019t quite the best at everything. Play begins at: 11am local time/4pm BST except for on Arthur Ashe, which starts at 12pm/5pm.",

Did they treat Day differently because she was Aboriginal? Did they consider the particular vulnerabilities she may have as an Aboriginal woman before placing her in custody?</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one is suggesting you are a bigot,\u201d he reassured each witness, but is it possible you could have been influenced by unconscious bias?</p> \n<p>Snr const Matthew Fitzgibbon said he was aware that unconscious bias could affect they way some people treated others, but \u201cnot the way I treat people\u201d.</p> \n<p>He had signed on to be a police Aboriginal liaison officer the week before but later decided it was inappropriate, given Day\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>Asked if he could explain why, in 2017, Aboriginal women were 10 times more likely to be arrested for the crime of public drunkenness, Fitzgibbon said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t give an answer to that\u201d.</p> \n<p>The witness box is directly in front of the seats occupied by Day\u2019s children.

They first let that woman wait, unsupervised, at a hotel. When questioned, they said that woman was less intoxicated than Day and was able to provide an address that was only five minutes from Castlemaine. That woman was not Indigenous.</p> \n<p>Sandra Owen, from the Aboriginal Community Justice Partnership, said that in her experience Aboriginal people were discriminated against on public transport. The ACJP is a volunteer network that performs 24/7 welfare checks and justice advocacy work.</p> \n<p>Owen said police called her about Day\u2019s arrest and she told them to call back when Day was sober. Police told Owen that Day \u201cdid not want to speak with ACJP at that time\u201d.</p> \n<p>Owen rejected a suggestion, made by police, that she said she would not help because Day was unknown to her, telling the inquest: \u201cWe help everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>The ACJP for the Dja Dja Wurrung area was at that time staffed by three volunteers, and Owens said that picking up a drunk person they did not know personally \u201cput them at risk\u201d because they could not anticipate their behaviour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc2f2819a6b38c083eaacde3af693a251377262f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc2f2819a6b38c083eaacde3af693a251377262f/10_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screen grab from CCTV footage of Tanya Day\u2019s arrest at Castlemaine police station on 5 December 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screen grab from CCTV footage of Tanya Day\u2019s arrest at Castlemaine police station on 5 December 2017.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vic Police</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Since Day\u2019s death, she said, volunteers have been told to insist on talking to the arrested person directly, regardless of what police say.</p> \n<h2>Arrest powers and the four-hour rule</h2> \n<p>None of the four police officers who interacted with Day at the train station, before she was taken to the police station, told her she was under arrest, cautioned her, or told her she would be placed in police cells.</p> \n<p>Each said they independently determined that she would be arrested for being drunk in a public place.</p> \n<p>Fitzgibbon said the process of arresting someone for being drunk in public had changed from charging and bailing them to issuing an infringement notice. The infringement notice was written up at the station.</p> \n<p>Snr const Stephen Thomas said his powers of arrest were the basis for compelling Day to leave the train. Fitzgibbon and Hurford said that arrest was continuing when they took her in the van to the station.</p> \n<p>They had the discretion not to take her into custody, but all said they felt, for her own safety, they had no choice.</p> \n<p>Hurford told Day\u2019s daughter, Kimberley Watson, that her mother would be held for four hours. That call took place before they left the train station.</p> \n<p>All four officers said it was their practice to take an intoxicated person into custody for four hours or until they sobered up. They could not cite the origin of that rule.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s written anywhere,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the police force for 13 years and it\u2019s just always been four hours.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d1085451-15f4-43dc-a954-d6123f8f6683\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2ABNifs5mm4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hurford said Day was held for four hours \u201cas per our procedure with any drunk\u201d.</p> \n<p>If they had been able to organise for a friend or relative to collect her, they would have released Day into their custody, they said.

      "bodyText": "Tanya Day died in hospital on 22 December 2017 from a brain haemorrhage caused by a \u201csignificant fall\u201d in the cells of Castlemaine police station 17 days earlier. Her family and supporters filled the coroners court in South Melbourne this week, split down the aisle from police officers and teams of lawyers, to hear the first week of evidence at an inquest into her death. This is what was said. What happened? Day, a 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman, purchased a V/Line ticket to Melbourne at Echuca train station about midday on 5 December 2017, caught a bus to Bendigo, and then changed to a train to Melbourne. The train conductor, Shaun Irvine, radioed for police after finding Day asleep and once roused unable to respond \u201cmeaningfully\u201d to his questions. She was described in the radio calls as \u201cunruly\u201d. Police met the train at Castlemaine at 3.05pm and took Day off the train. They later wrote her up for being drunk in public. Her blood alcohol level at the station was estimated to be 0.30. She was taken to the police cells to \u201csober up\u201d and fell five times in the cell, including a \u201csignificant\u201d fall at 4.50pm. The inquest was told police failed to conduct the required cell checks. The ambulance was called at 8pm. Did racism cause her death? This is the first inquest in Australia to consider whether systemic racism was a contributing factor to a death in custody. Counsel for the Day family, Peter Morrissey SC, asked a set of questions of the four police officers involved in Day\u2019s arrest for public drunkenness. Did they treat Day differently because she was Aboriginal? Did they consider the particular vulnerabilities she may have as an Aboriginal woman before placing her in custody? \u201cNo one is suggesting you are a bigot,\u201d he reassured each witness, but is it possible you could have been influenced by unconscious bias? Snr const Matthew Fitzgibbon said he was aware that unconscious bias could affect they way some people treated others, but \u201cnot the way I treat people\u201d. He had signed on to be a police Aboriginal liaison officer the week before but later decided it was inappropriate, given Day\u2019s death. Asked if he could explain why, in 2017, Aboriginal women were 10 times more likely to be arrested for the crime of public drunkenness, Fitzgibbon said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t give an answer to that\u201d. The witness box is directly in front of the seats occupied by Day\u2019s children. Under their direct gaze, some witnesses hesitated before answering questions about racism. After Morrissey\u2019s questioning, Rachel Ellyard, lawyer for police, asked each officer if they would have treated Day differently if she was not an Aboriginal person. All said no. \u201cWe try to treat everyone equally but tried to treat her better than equally,\u201d snr const Kristian Hurford said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t your everyday drunk person.\u201d Two of the police drove another drunk woman home immediately after taking Day off the train. They first let that woman wait, unsupervised, at a hotel. When questioned, they said that woman was less intoxicated than Day and was able to provide an address that was only five minutes from Castlemaine. That woman was not Indigenous. Sandra Owen, from the Aboriginal Community Justice Partnership, said that in her experience Aboriginal people were discriminated against on public transport. The ACJP is a volunteer network that performs 24/7 welfare checks and justice advocacy work. Owen said police called her about Day\u2019s arrest and she told them to call back when Day was sober. Police told Owen that Day \u201cdid not want to speak with ACJP at that time\u201d. Owen rejected a suggestion, made by police, that she said she would not help because Day was unknown to her, telling the inquest: \u201cWe help everyone.\u201d The ACJP for the Dja Dja Wurrung area was at that time staffed by three volunteers, and Owens said that picking up a drunk person they did not know personally \u201cput them at risk\u201d because they could not anticipate their behaviour. Since Day\u2019s death, she said, volunteers have been told to insist on talking to the arrested person directly, regardless of what police say. Arrest powers and the four-hour rule None of the four police officers who interacted with Day at the train station, before she was taken to the police station, told her she was under arrest, cautioned her, or told her she would be placed in police cells. Each said they independently determined that she would be arrested for being drunk in a public place. Fitzgibbon said the process of arresting someone for being drunk in public had changed from charging and bailing them to issuing an infringement notice. The infringement notice was written up at the station. Snr const Stephen Thomas said his powers of arrest were the basis for compelling Day to leave the train. Fitzgibbon and Hurford said that arrest was continuing when they took her in the van to the station. They had the discretion not to take her into custody, but all said they felt, for her own safety, they had no choice. Hurford told Day\u2019s daughter, Kimberley Watson, that her mother would be held for four hours. That call took place before they left the train station. All four officers said it was their practice to take an intoxicated person into custody for four hours or until they sobered up. They could not cite the origin of that rule. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s written anywhere,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the police force for 13 years and it\u2019s just always been four hours.\u201d Hurford said Day was held for four hours \u201cas per our procedure with any drunk\u201d. If they had been able to organise for a friend or relative to collect her, they would have released Day into their custody, they said. Day\u2019s daughters were unable to attend but her son was driving down from Echuca when she was sent to hospital. Why didn\u2019t police send her to hospital? The Victoria police manual states that officers must conduct an assessment against a medical checklist when placing someone under arrest, and can transport someone only after undertaking a medical and risk assessment. The four police involved in Day\u2019s arrest said they were familiar with the guidelines and the medical checklist, which includes the coma scale test. The coma scale is ranked from one to five. A person who is giving \u201cmeaningless, unintelligible\u201d responses is a three and the action specified is \u201cSend to hospital or seek urgent medical advice.\u201d All four said Day was at some points unintelligible but became more lucid as time went on. They said they did not consider calling an ambulance or seeking medical advice. What happens next? The police officers charged with supervising Day in custody are scheduled to give evidence early next week. Day\u2019s family have argued for all the footage of her in the cells to be released in full, but the coroner is yet to announce her decision.",

The biggest party, Fretilin, unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975. Indonesia, which was already carrying out secret attacks across the border from West Timor, invaded nine days later.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Why were the East Timorese so opposed to Indonesian rule?</b></p>\n    <p>Portugal\u2019s colonial influence meant the population was culturally very different from the rest of Indonesia. The vast majority of East Timorese are devout Catholics and speak their own language (Tetun).</p>\n    <p><b>What happened after the invasion?</b></p>\n    <p>The world largely looked the other way and some 200,000 people died over the next 24 years of Indonesian occupation. In July 1976 Indonesia\u2019s parliament declared East Timor the country\u2019s 27th province.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>What happened to the Timorese resistance?</b></p>\n    <p>The armed resistance was decimated and, in 1992, its leader, Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, was captured and imprisoned in Jakarta. Exiled leaders, like Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, kept up the fight. In 1996 Ramos-Horta shared the Nobel peace prize with the head of the Catholic church in East Timor, Bishop Carlos Belo. But the brutal occupation continued.</p>\n    <p><b>Why did Indonesia change its stance towards East Timor?</b></p>\n    <p>In 1998 Indonesia's President Suharto, in power for 30 years, resigned amid the Asian financial crisis and massive pro-democracy protests in Jakarta. His successor, BJ Habibie, was more open to some form of autonomy for East Timor. In March 1999 he announced that if the East Timorese favoured independence over autonomy under Indonesia, he would grant it.</p>\n    <p><b>What happened in the referendum and its aftermath?</b></p>\n    <p>On 30 August 1999 the UN oversaw an historic ballot, in which 78.5% of East Timorese rejected autonomy in favour of independence. Indonesian-backed militia groups who had terrorised the population before the vote stepped up their attacks, aided by Indonesian security forces. A three-week campaign of violence killed 2,600 people, nearly 30,000 were displaced and as many as 250,000 <a href=\"https://www.etan.org/etanpdf/2006/CAVR/Chega!-Report-Executive-Summary.pdf\">were forcibly shipped over the border to Indonesian West Timor</a>, in what amounted to a scorched-earth policy.</p>\n    <p><b>How did the world respond?</b></p>\n    <p>On 20 September 1999 an Australian-led international peacekeeping force, Interfet, arrived to restore order. Gusm\u00e3o and other exiled leaders returned. Elections in 2002 saw him become newly named Timor Leste's first president</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Carmelita was working at a restaurant in Halls Gap when an Australian peace-keeping force, and then a multinational force known as Interfet, were finally sent in to stop the bloodshed.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll of a sudden people knew where Timor was,\u201d she says. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Aren\u2019t you glad the Australians are there?\u2019 And I would just go bright red.

In our lounge room in north Perth, I sat on the edge of the couch, and watched almost every ball on our old wooden TV. The only time I got up was for meals, toilet breaks and to delicately adjust the rabbit ear antenna when the picture got too blurry.</p> <p>David Boon hit 143 to help Australia win the first Test, Border 205 to draw the second. By Boxing Day all they needed was a draw to win the series. But on the last day, wickets started tumbling, until the last two batsmen were Craig McDermott and Mike Whitney. With the sun setting over the MCG, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FXwWD5ZWiA\">they had to survive five overs</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/29/jack-leach-glasses-headingley-cricket\">Jack Leach\u2019s glasses cause optical illusion that we could be like him | Max Rushden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whitney was 28 and playing his first Test in six years. He hd scored three ducks in his last five innings. His career average was 5.6. And he was facing Richard Hadlee, one of the best bowlers in the world, who had already taken 10 wickets for the match.</p> <p>They somehow survived for four overs. Whitney was facing the last six balls. The first ball soared past, and Whitney\u2019s bat flailed like a broken electricity cable in a storm. The second missed the edge by millimetres. But he hung on, until the there was one ball left. Three tests, and 14 days of cricket came down to this moment. As Hadlee sped in, Ian Chappell murmured from the commentary box, \u201cGood luck Whit\u201d.</p> <p>The ball pitched perfectly on the stumps. Whitney stepped forward and dug it out like his bat was a shovel. The match was saved. The MCG went crazy. And in north Perth I cheered so loud, Mum ran into the lounge to make sure I was OK.</p> <p>That match taught me to never give up on a contest, to keep watching until the very end, and no matter what happens, never leave your seat.

      "bodyText": "I fell for cricket in the summer of 1987. I was eight years old and Australia were playing three Tests against New Zealand. In our lounge room in north Perth, I sat on the edge of the couch, and watched almost every ball on our old wooden TV. The only time I got up was for meals, toilet breaks and to delicately adjust the rabbit ear antenna when the picture got too blurry. David Boon hit 143 to help Australia win the first Test, Border 205 to draw the second. By Boxing Day all they needed was a draw to win the series. But on the last day, wickets started tumbling, until the last two batsmen were Craig McDermott and Mike Whitney. With the sun setting over the MCG, they had to survive five overs. Whitney was 28 and playing his first Test in six years. He hd scored three ducks in his last five innings. His career average was 5.6. And he was facing Richard Hadlee, one of the best bowlers in the world, who had already taken 10 wickets for the match. They somehow survived for four overs. Whitney was facing the last six balls. The first ball soared past, and Whitney\u2019s bat flailed like a broken electricity cable in a storm. The second missed the edge by millimetres. But he hung on, until the there was one ball left. Three tests, and 14 days of cricket came down to this moment. As Hadlee sped in, Ian Chappell murmured from the commentary box, \u201cGood luck Whit\u201d. The ball pitched perfectly on the stumps. Whitney stepped forward and dug it out like his bat was a shovel. The match was saved. The MCG went crazy. And in north Perth I cheered so loud, Mum ran into the lounge to make sure I was OK. That match taught me to never give up on a contest, to keep watching until the very end, and no matter what happens, never leave your seat. The whole story could shift with a single ball, a dropped catch, a bad decision, or a brave last stand by a 28-year-old bowler who looked like a singer in a pub rock band. It led to some very long nights watching Australia play on the other side of the world. In 1995 I watched Steve Waugh hit a double century in Kingston, helping Australia win the Frank Worrell trophy for the first time in 19 years.

The win put Arsenal above their rivals on goal difference but they would eventually finish behind them \u2013 by a single point \u2013 for a third successive year.

His return to training was delayed by illness, meaning he was absent from the home win over Burnley, and he was not deemed fit enough for last Saturday\u2019s defeat at Liverpool. Emery was asked whether he could ever expect him to be a consistent performer and he pointed out the different dimension he still believes \u00d6zil can bring. \u201cWe need him,\u201d Emery said, \u201cand [need] him first to be consistent in training, to be available in each match. For example last week he wasn\u2019t ready to play 100% in Liverpool. This week he is getting better with each training [session] and I think physically he is now better. He is closer to helping us. We need him because he is a different player in our team. He can help us with his quality.\u201d Emery has suggested in the past that \u00d6zil\u2019s absences are something he must work around but denied any frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my control,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are speaking a lot with every player, especially with [\u00d6zil] on whether he is not ready to play, he is sick or he has a circumstance like he had with Sead. We are here only to help him and support him, and after to demand that he is ready for training, because we need him in our way this year.\u201d Last December \u00d6zil was absent with back trouble when Arsenal defeated Tottenham 4-2 at the Emirates. The win put Arsenal above their rivals on goal difference but they would eventually finish behind them \u2013 by a single point \u2013 for a third successive year. This season they have made the better start and Emery sees Sunday as a chance to reassert local supremacy. \u201cI think our capacity and their capacity are very similar,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last year they are getting better in the table than us but our challenge is now to reduce the gap and have the possibility to become better this year than them. I am looking forward to seeing how our team and our supporters can respond and take that test against them.\u201d One player definitely unavailable is Mohamed Elneny, who is on the verge of a one-year loan to Besiktas. The deal is all but done, with only bonus-related details to be agreed. The Besiktas sporting director, Ali Naibi, said: \u201cWe have reached an agreement with Arsenal over Mohamed Elneny. He will undergo his medical next. If he passes we will add him to our squad on a loan transfer.\u201d",

Instead he rode it a little but it was a horror challenge. \u201cAs it is Matty\u2019s in a mess, there\u2019s ankle ligament damage, bone bruising, cuts, three lots of stitches. Let\u2019s hope the young lad Choudhury learns from it because he\u2019s a very good player \u2013 but you can get a reputation. He has to be careful.\u201d Choudhury, who was sent off for a lunging tackle on France\u2019s Jonathan Bamba on England Under-21 duty in June, has sent Ritchie his best wishes but remains unrepentant. \u201cIt was a 50-50,\u201d he said. \u201cHe pulled out at the last minute, which made it look a lot worse. I\u2019ve never gone in to hurt someone but unfortunately it has. I hope he gets better soon. I know Steve Bruce was a tough-tackling defender in his day; people are quick to forget how they played football.\u201d Bruce was not impressed. \u201cI never went over the ball,\u201d he said. \u201cNever.\u201d Bruce believes the \u201cexcessive force\u201d used by Choudhury renders the fact the midfielder won the ball irrelevant and admitted he was \u201craging\u201d at the referee\u2019s failure to spot a \u201cblatant red card\u201d. He had a private chat with the Leicester manager, Brendan Rodgers, who, sensibly, withdrew Choudhury after the incident. \u201cI think Brendan knew it was a poor, poor challenge,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI love to see people tackle but it was a bad challenge that hurts people. It could have been much, much worse. I honestly thought it might have been six months out when I saw Matt after the game.\u201d",

Judge Col W Shane Cohen set a start date of early 2021 in an order setting motion and evidentiary deadlines on Friday. The five defendants include Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a senior al-Qaida figure who has portrayed himself as the mastermind of the 11 September 2001 attacks and other terrorist plots. The men were first charged in 2008 and military commission proceedings began in 2012 but have moved at a snail\u2019s pace, with more than 30 pre-trial hearings and endless procedural arguments. Witnesses have died, lawyers have grown old and victims\u2019 families patience has been sorely tested. In setting 11 January 2021 for the start of selection of a military jury, Cohen acknowledged that the trial at the base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the US military zone in south-east Cuba, \u201cwill face a host of administrative and logistics challenges\u201d. The US charged the five with war crimes that include terrorism, hijacking and nearly 3,000 counts of murder for their alleged roles planning and providing logistical support to the 9/11 plot, in which airliners were crashed into the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon near Washington and a field in Pennsylvania. The five could receive the death penalty if convicted at the military commission, which combines elements of civilian and military law. Mohammad, described by the the 9/11 commission report as the \u201cprincipal architect\u201d of those attacks, was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and held and tortured in secret CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d in Afghanistan and eastern Europe for three years, before being flown to Guant\u00e1namo in September 2006. His co-defendants are Walid bin Attash, alleged to have run an al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan where two of the hijackers were trained; Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni accused of helping organise logistics for the attack; Ammar al-Baluchi, alleged to have played a critical role in funding the hijackers and organising their flight school training; and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, a Saudi accused of acquiring cash, credit cards and clothing for the hijackers.

According to the New York Times, Cohen \u201cbegins a series of hearings next month with witnesses in an effort by the defense teams to exclude confessions the defendants made to FBI agents in early 2006 as tainted by the years of CIA torture.\u201d Barack Obama tried and failed to close the prison on Guant\u00e1namo Bay, whereas Donald Trump pledged to \u201cload it up with some bad dudes\u201d and signed an executive order to keep it open.

Jones, the former Ireland full-back, was part of Schmidt\u2019s management team on the 2017 tour to Japan. \u201cI have had a chat with him,\u201d said the coach. \u201cIt is a fantastic opportunity to go to a World Cup with a team that is on a massive upward swing, but it is awkward for us because he has been right in amongst us. He is a smart coach and I hope we do not suffer as a consequence.\u201d For the players in Cardiff, it is all about the World Cup and making a loud statement to keep the phone silent.",

We delved into the psychical depths of how humanity at once can prepare for the worst, hope for the best and at neither point trust each other to do the best by the dependents they have created or brought into the familial fold, without the wet-nosed, limpid-eyed, wholly innocent creature \u2013 fur-clad or no \u2013 having any say in the matter whatsoever.

Eleven years after he was last spruced up, National Trust rangers, archaeology experts and an army of volunteers have reset his edges, dug out the weathered rocks and rechalked him.</p> \n<p>People\u2019s hard work and devotion to such causes always makes the heart sing, but now more than ever there is something tremendously moving about people banding together to ensure that a figure certainly centuries and possibly thousands of years old, whose origins are lost in the mists of time, will continue to endure, and in as fine fettle as they can make him.</p> \n<p>As Larkin wrote, what will survive of us is love.

You\u2019ve had 90 years of doing the right thing and good for you, but now\u2019s the time to blow your brownie points, you know? Yes, you\u2019re the fulcrum upon which an impossibly delicately cantilevered accretion of checks and balances rests \u2013 so just think what fun it would be if you blew the whole thing sky high! It\u2019s not as if there are many people left who are playing by the rules. This is your moment, Liz! Summon a footman. Tell him to tell Boris you\u2019ve changed your mind. Handbag-sandbag him. Go, \u201cFark you, De Pfeffel\u201d and then swan off to enjoy yourself at the races. A lifetime of dutiful service to Britain and the Commonwealth and where has it got you? Standing as the nominal head of a country that\u2019s the laughing stock of the world. Put the national salvage rights on the steeplechase at Newmarket or something and laugh yourself daft at the thought of No 10 in meltdown. Let your cackling ring from Land\u2019s End to John o\u2019Groats. I promise you, it will feel great. Thursday A divorce lawyer friend of mine is being brought to the edge of a nervous breakdown by the increasing number of \u201cpet-nups\u201d crossing her desk; the agreements covering who gets custody of a couple\u2019s cat/dog/terrapin in the event of an acrimonious breakup. \u201cI can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s the peak of civilisation or a sign \u2013 another sign \u2013 of the end of days,\u201d she cried, clutching her hair and burying her face in a giant glass of Ch\u00e2teau This Might Help. It did. During some well-lubricated discussion, we weighed the relative merits of people wishing to do the best by their pets versus very rarely making such detailed provision for any future or present children. We delved into the psychical depths of how humanity at once can prepare for the worst, hope for the best and at neither point trust each other to do the best by the dependents they have created or brought into the familial fold, without the wet-nosed, limpid-eyed, wholly innocent creature \u2013 fur-clad or no \u2013 having any say in the matter whatsoever. We decided that it was another one to add to the end of days pile. And moved on to whisky. Because that always helps. Friday But lo! A new day dawns and a new weekend looms and some good news rises to greet us. The Cerne Abbas giant, owner of Dorset\u2019s finest phallus (as far as I\u2019m aware \u2013 please feel free not to send me any pictorial or descriptive evidence otherwise), has been fully restored to glory. Eleven years after he was last spruced up, National Trust rangers, archaeology experts and an army of volunteers have reset his edges, dug out the weathered rocks and rechalked him. People\u2019s hard work and devotion to such causes always makes the heart sing, but now more than ever there is something tremendously moving about people banding together to ensure that a figure certainly centuries and possibly thousands of years old, whose origins are lost in the mists of time, will continue to endure, and in as fine fettle as they can make him. As Larkin wrote, what will survive of us is love. And an enormous cock and balls carved for perhaps no reason at all on a hillside.",

      "bodyText": "Hurricane Dorian is projected to make landfall on Florida\u2019s east coast early next week as a potential category 4 storm with winds up to 140mph. While hurricane activity on the Atlantic coast is not uncommon, the deadliest recent storms to strike Florida, including Michael (2018) and Irma (2017), approached from the Gulf side, the south and west. Other notorious recent storms, such as Gustav (2008), Ike (2008) and Katrina (2005), likewise moved through the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall elsewhere, though Katrina glanced off Florida as it entered the Gulf. Here is a list of historic hurricanes that made landfall on Florida\u2019s east coast: Hurricane Jeanne, September 2004 Toll: Caused 3,000 or more deaths from flooding and landslides in Haiti before striking Florida, where it was directly responsible for three deaths in the state and almost $8bn in damages. Track: Three weeks after Hurricane Frances, Jeanne moved north from its devastating blow to Haiti before making an extraordinary 360-degree loop in the western Atlantic to head straight for Florida. It made landfall almost exactly where Frances had on Florida\u2019s east coast and killed three in the state, one in South Carolina and one in Virginia. Hurricane Frances, September 2004 Toll: Directly responsible for seven deaths and indirectly responsible for 43, including 37 total in Florida. Estimated damages of $9bn, not including agricultural losses. Track: Also falling on Labor Day weekend, the storm made landfall as a category 2 hurricane near Port St Lucie, crossed southern Florida and then passed into the Gulf before striking Florida again at the Panhandle. Only three weeks behind Hurricane Charley, Frances dropped more than a foot of rain, opened sinkholes, knocked out power and damaged the US space exploration facility at Cape Canaveral. Hurricane Andrew, August 1992 Toll: Directly responsible for 26 deaths, indirectly responsible for 39, including 44 total in Florida. The storm destroyed 25,524 homes and damaged 101,241, with total estimated damages of more than $25bn, making it at the time the costliest disaster in state history. Track: After tracking directly across the Atlantic toward southern Florida, Andrew made landfall as a category 5 hurricane, the biggest on the Saffir-Simpson scale, in the area of Homestead south of Miami. Though relatively small, it demonstrated brutal ferocity with wind gusts of up to 175mph and a storm surge flattening residences in square-mile swathes. Hurricane Dora, September 1964 Toll: Responsible for three deaths in Florida and hundreds of millions in damages.

Okeechobee, September 1928 Toll: One of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history, the Okeechobee hurricane of 1928 came directly through the Bahamas to slam the Florida coast, where it killed more than 2,500 people at a time when flood containment measures were rudimentary.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government is working on a plan B to the national energy guarantee ahead of a meeting of federal and state energy ministers expected next month. The Morrison government has been under pressure from some of the Liberal state governments, including NSW, to bring back the Neg. The policy was a casualty of the federal Liberal party\u2019s leadership eruption last August. The Neg remains the first preference of the some of the state jurisdictions, given it allows for a national approach. It also has strong support from business and the energy sector. But given the commonwealth has signalled that Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s signature energy policy will not be revived, Guardian Australia understands NSW is now working on an alternative 2030 strategy that will require policy support from Canberra. Officials say the NSW plan would involve Canberra assisting a transition to lower emissions by underwriting generation, probably firmed renewables, to replace the Liddell power station, and also underwriting and de-risking new investments in transmission that have been highlighted as urgent by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo). It is possible NSW will ask Canberra for seed funding for some transmission projects, as well as a regulatory overhaul to make the investments more attractive to private proponents. It is understood preliminary discussions about the ideas between NSW and Canberra have been constructive. State governments have pursued discussions among themselves since the failure of the Neg about how they can work up a joint strategy on transmission, including rolling out the poles and wires necessary to transfer supply from the Snowy 2.0 expansion into NSW and Victoria. Officials insist the state proposal is well advanced but the NSW energy and environment minister, Matt Kean, declined to comment when contacted by Guardian Australia. The federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, is yet to confirm when he will meet his state counterparts in the Coag energy council, but some stakeholders believe the meeting will be in Brisbane in September. The Coag council has been in abeyance, with the Liberal states continuing to champion the Neg and Taylor refusing a reboot on the basis it would reopen the divisions in Canberra that helped foment the strike against Turnbull. There is a view in NSW that the ageing Liddell plant needs to be replaced by firmed renewables with gas peaking as back-up, because that\u2019s the cheapest option and will also help to reduce emissions. But the power baron Trevor St Baker is lobbying Canberra and the Berejiklian government to transform the site into an \u201cexclusive baseload power precinct\u201d. St Baker told Guardian Australia: \u201cI think making Liddell an exclusive baseload power precinct and paying all the existing generators for spinning reserve that they\u2019ve never been paid for could give AGL or any purchaser of Liddell a better business case to keep it going for as long as it can keep going, and not retiring it until it is replaced by a like for like baseload plant providing 24/7 power.\u201d In May, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, indicated in an interview with Guardian Australia that the then newly elected Morrison government would pursue new infrastructure to support renewable energy zones in line with advice from Aemo. Aemo used its most recent 10-year forecast of reliability in Australia\u2019s power supply to highlight the urgent need for more investment in dispatchable energy and in transmission infrastructure. In a frank assessment, the chief executive of Aemo, Audrey Zibelman, said the energy market operator had been engaged in \u201creactive action\u201d to ensure the risks of blackouts were reduced during the summer peaks. But she said the current methods of securing additional resources were imposing higher costs on consumers. Zibelman said that while the actions Aemo had taken to shore up power supply were allowed for under the energy market rules, the higher costs they were imposing, as well as the ongoing risks to reliability, were \u201cnot sustainable over the longer term\u201d. The Aemo chief has called for \u201cdeliberate actions that address the challenges of our ageing coal fleet and which meet the need for secure and dispatchable supply, while also taking advantage of Australia\u2019s natural resources\u201d. \u201cWe need to harness all the resources we have in the system, together with the opportunities that come with the technological advances occurring in the industry to meet current and future energy demands at the lowest cost possible.\u201d",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Major told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme in July that he felt strongly about parliamentary tradition, having served in the Commons for two decades.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand by and see them disregarded in this fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is utterly, utterly and completely the wrong way to proceed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Announcing the high court\u2019s decision to grant her permission to intervene on Friday evening, Chakrabarti said: \u201cParliamentary sovereignty remains the foremost and overarching principle of our constitution.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhatever far-right play-book No 10 may be copying from, the abusive shutdown of our legislature won\u2019t wash under United Kingdom constitutional law.\u201d</p> \n<p>Watson said he would join Miller\u2019s action and be represented by Mischon de Reya and the QC David Pannick, who are also Miller\u2019s representatives. \u201cI intend to assist the court from the perspective of an active legislator,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Swinson said the Lib Dems \u201care doing all we can, both in the courts and in parliament, to prevent both the shutdown of our democracy and a no-deal Brexit\u201d.</p> \n<p>The government also faces parallel legal actions by anti-Brexit campaigners in Edinburgh and Belfast.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/boris-johnson-prorogue-parliament-scottish-judge\">Scottish judge temporarily rejected calls</a> for an effective injunction to stop prorogation at a hearing on Friday, after it was claimed during an emergency court hearing on Thursday that Johnson was acting illegally and in breach of the constitution.

Major, who has been a prominent critic of the government\u2019s Brexit policy, had previously vowed he would mount a legal challenge if Johnson sought to prorogue parliament in order to curtail parliamentary debates or legislative efforts to stop no deal. \u201cI promised that, if the prime minister prorogued parliament in order to prevent members from opposing his Brexit plans, I would seek judicial review of his action,\u201d Major said in a statement on Friday. \u201cIn view of the imminence of the prorogation \u2013 and to avoid duplication of effort, and taking up the court\u2019s time through repetition \u2013 I intend to seek the court\u2019s permission to intervene in the claim already initiated by Gina Miller, rather than to commence separate proceedings. \u201cIf granted permission to intervene, I intend to seek to assist the court from the perspective of having served in government as a minister and prime minister, and also in parliament for many years as a member of the House of Commons.\u201d Major is set to be represented by the QC and former minister Edward Garnier, who was solicitor general under David Cameron and is now a Conservative peer. The former prime minister had made the commitment in July that he would challenge Johnson when rumours began that the latter would use prorogation to force a no-deal Brexit \u2013 though under the current terms parliament would now return two weeks before the Brexit deadline. Major told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme in July that he felt strongly about parliamentary tradition, having served in the Commons for two decades. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand by and see them disregarded in this fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is utterly, utterly and completely the wrong way to proceed.\u201d Announcing the high court\u2019s decision to grant her permission to intervene on Friday evening, Chakrabarti said: \u201cParliamentary sovereignty remains the foremost and overarching principle of our constitution. \u201cWhatever far-right play-book No 10 may be copying from, the abusive shutdown of our legislature won\u2019t wash under United Kingdom constitutional law.\u201d Watson said he would join Miller\u2019s action and be represented by Mischon de Reya and the QC David Pannick, who are also Miller\u2019s representatives. \u201cI intend to assist the court from the perspective of an active legislator,\u201d he said. Swinson said the Lib Dems \u201care doing all we can, both in the courts and in parliament, to prevent both the shutdown of our democracy and a no-deal Brexit\u201d. The government also faces parallel legal actions by anti-Brexit campaigners in Edinburgh and Belfast. A Scottish judge temporarily rejected calls for an effective injunction to stop prorogation at a hearing on Friday, after it was claimed during an emergency court hearing on Thursday that Johnson was acting illegally and in breach of the constitution. A full hearing of the case has been fast-tracked to next week.",

A total of 4,874 bodies were found at 3,025 sites, and many of the victims have yet to be identified, said Karla Quintana, the head of the National Search Committee, which was set up last year to help desperate families find relatives who have gone missing. \u201cThis is the data of horror,\u201d she said at a press conference on Friday. \u201cThis is not about the numbers. This is about the thousands of people who are looking for the relatives and the thousands not in their homes.\u201d Disappearances have become common amid the extreme violence triggered by a counterproductive military offensive against organized criminal groups originally launched in 2006. More than 200,000 people have died since then, with the number of missing estimated at 40,000 \u2013 though the data is notoriously sketchy because of the reluctance of successive governments to recognize the gravity of the problem. This has also left desperate relatives to spearhead search efforts, even setting off with picks and spades to comb scrub-covered mountains for signs of hidden graves. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador won last year\u2019s presidential election with a promise to finally create reliable databases, and develop the infrastructure to effectively search for the disappeared \u2013 alive or dead. Quintana said that 522 of the 3,025 graves were discovered since the new government took office in December. She also emphasized the creation of search brigades providing relatives with support and resources. One such group looking for graves in Sinaloa state this week found bags full of thousands of finger bones \u2013 presumably from hands severed during torture. The data on hidden graves nationwide was released to coincide with the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances, a term usually used only to refer to disappearances attributed to state forces. In Latin America the phrase has traditionally conjured up images of 1970s military dictatorships who rounded up political dissidents and tortured them in clandestine jails, their bodies sometimes then dumped into the sea from aircraft. In today\u2019s Mexico, most disappearances are attributed to criminal gangs, although pervasive collusion means the line between state forces and the underworld is often blurred as in the case of 43 student teachers who disappeared in September 2014 after they were attacked by police who then apparently handed over to cartels in the southern city of Iguala. For Felix Pita Garc\u00eda, who says his son was taken from a bar in Iguala by soldiers in 2010, the new official willingness to look for the missing is welcome but not enough to ease his pain. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true, there has been a big change with this government on this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my heart is still in pieces.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg was joined by swelling and excited crowds of American teenagers at a protest outside the UN headquarters in New York on Friday, in a further blossoming of the youth environment movement given extra thrust by the Swede\u2019s transatlantic boat crossing. Some US children said they were at their first ever climate demonstration; others said they had been passionate about the environment for a while but had been galvanized to act by Thunberg\u2019s rising profile. On Friday afternoon, Thunberg and two young activists were spontaneously invited inside the UN for a meeting with a senior leader, described as \u201cvery supportive\u201d. Just two days after Thunberg disembarked from a yacht in New York, following two weeks on rough seas crossing from the UK, young protesters dominated the crowd of up to 1,000 outside the United Nations skyscraper in Manhattan. They came together to demand politicians and older generations take urgent and comprehensive action to reverse the climate crisis. Carrying hand-drawn placards with messages such as \u201cUnited behind the science\u201d and \u201cAct now or we will\u201d, children and young people of all ages surged into a park in front of the flags of the world outside the UN on Friday morning. Thunberg sat cheerfully but pensively in the middle of the rally, which had a rather more earnest than festive atmosphere. Young speakers gave spontaneous speeches or led chants of \u201cSystem change, not climate change\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t just watch us, join us\u201d. Alexandria Villase\u00f1or, 14, who has been protesting every Friday outside the UN since December, was in her usual spot and said she had been inspired by Thunberg\u2019s school strike campaign. She said: \u201cGreta being here will really galvanise students just because of how much of an inspiration she is. Everyone who\u2019s been striking on Friday was really empowered by Greta and the action she was taking.\u201d Thunberg held her trademark \u201cskolstrejk f\u00f6r klimatet\u201d (Swedish for \u201cschool strike for climate\u201d) sign, which she was seen carrying from the racing yacht on Wednesday, after refusing to take a flight to the US because of the polluting emissions. For Dana Henao, 16, from Brentwood, Long Island, Friday marked her first climate protest. \u201cThe government isn\u2019t taking enough action to protect the environment and all they care about is the money they make with corporations polluting the planet and I think we should put a stop to it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe young people are the only ones taking action and we want to call attention to this.\u201d She added: \u201cShe [Greta] is really popular and she\u2019s, like, the face of the movement.\u201d On Friday afternoon, Thunberg, Villase\u00f1or and Xiye Bastida Patrick, 17, a Fridays for Future organiser, went inside the UN for an impromptu meeting with general assembly president Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa after receiving an invitation during the protest. The trio were given a tour \u2013 including a preview of the general assembly podium, at which Thunberg will speak during next month\u2019s climate action summit, and had a meeting with Espinosa, where they spoke about the summit, global heating, forest fires around the world, the Amazon fire and single-use plastics. Villase\u00f1or said the president was \u201cvery supportive\u201d. She said: \u201cI said I want to see world leaders take climate action to reduce global greenhouse emissions and stay in line with the Paris agreement and also September 20 we will continue pushing and demanding that they do.\u201d Thunberg told the Guardian in an interview shortly after disembarking from the special \u201czero emissions\u201d yacht that she wanted \u201ca concrete plan, not just nice words\u201d from leaders about taking urgent and comprehensive action to head off the climate crisis. Villase\u00f1or, who is thought to be America\u2019s first school striker to join the movement and has been exchanging tips with Thunberg online, had been among the group of American climate activists who welcomed her to the US when her yacht docked at North Cove Marina. She said: \u201cWhat\u2019s really important about Greta being here today is it\u2019s the start of something new.

The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, issued a blistering statement from sunny Turkey. The Tory veteran Michael Heseltine took to the airwaves from Montenegro in a natty embroidered shirt.</p> \n<p>But the blueprint for the rebels\u2019 response had already been set at a key meeting on Tuesday, convened by Jeremy Corbyn.

      "bodyText": "As Boris Johnson strolled down the aisle of his Voyager plane en route home from Biarritz on Monday evening, tie off and white shirt unbuttoned, to josh with the travelling journalists, he had a bullish air. The G7 summit had passed off without gaffes, he had carefully navigated the tricky diplomatic territory between Donald Trump and the EU, and he and his fellow old Etonian Ed Llewellyn, the UK\u2019s ambassador to France, had enjoyed two bracing swims in the sea. But at the PM\u2019s closing press conference in Biarritz \u2013 delayed while Trump held his own rambling address \u2013 Johnson had chosen his words exceedingly carefully. \u201cI rely on parliamentarians to do the right thing and honour the pledge that they made to the people of this country,\u201d he said when pressed repeatedly about whether he could prorogue parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit. Little more than 24 hours later, the explanation began to emerge. First, a speech by Sajid Javid billed as setting out his economic philosophy was abruptly cancelled. Then, late on Tuesday night, rumours began to swirl of a meeting of the privy council \u2013 a gathering of senior ministers with the Queen \u2013 at her Scottish summer retreat in Balmoral. Downing Street refused to confirm the story and instead began scrambling to accelerate the drastic plan drawn up by Johnson\u2019s legislative adviser, Nikki da Costa, and chief strategist, Dominic Cummings. On Wednesday morning a conference call of cabinet ministers was hastily convened at the insistence of the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, part of whose role is to act as the guardian of the constitution at the heart of Downing Street. Meanwhile, Jacob Rees-Mogg was boarding an early-morning flight to Aberdeen. His fellow privy council members Natalie Evans, the leader of the House of Lords, and the chief whip, Mark Spencer \u2013 neither easily recognisable by travellers \u2013 flew separately, to avoid scrutiny. As news of their mission broke, all hell broke loose. Johnson\u2019s hiring of Cummings was widely read as a signal that in his bid to achieve the \u201cmission\u201d of Brexit, he was willing to tear up convention and ride roughshod over the usual niceties of politics. While Johnson does not share the worldview of Donald Trump, he does privately admit a grudging admiration for the way the maverick US president plays the game of politics, believing there is more method in it than is sometimes apparent. Many of the ragtag band of rebels committed to stopping a no-deal Brexit were caught by surprise by Wednesday\u2019s announcement. Some were still abroad, squeezing the last few drops from the summer break. Dominic Grieve quickly began liaising with like-minded colleagues en route to a wedding in Italy, his wife at the wheel. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, issued a blistering statement from sunny Turkey. The Tory veteran Michael Heseltine took to the airwaves from Montenegro in a natty embroidered shirt. But the blueprint for the rebels\u2019 response had already been set at a key meeting on Tuesday, convened by Jeremy Corbyn. Attended by leading opposition figures including Jo Swinson and Caroline Lucas, the meeting ended with agreement that the priority was to rush through legislation to force Johnson to extend article 50 if he had not struck a Brexit deal in time for the 31 October deadline. On the cabinet conference call there was little open dissent, though Amber Rudd was noticeably less enthusiastic than colleagues and Julian Smith asked about the legal advice Downing Street had commissioned to underpin the decision. Beyond Downing Street, the backlash was ferocious. Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 not a noted monarchist \u2013 fired off a missive to the Queen asking for an audience and urging her to reverse the decision. But it was too late. The \u201corder in council\u201d formally recording her approval of the decision at the privy council meeting had already been published, headed with the emblem of the crown. By the end of the day a scratch crowd of protesters outside parliament, many of them draped in EU flags, were belting out \u201cno one voted for Bor-is\u201d, to the tune of the White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army, accompanied by a trumpet. Rees-Mogg, sent out on the airwaves to defend the decision in his trademark plummy vowels the next morning, dismissed the outrage as \u201ccandyfloss\u201d and stuck rigidly to the explanation that holding a Queen\u2019s speech was entirely usual for a new government. Johnson\u2019s outriders do not mind their opponents bandying around #Brexitcoup hashtags and threatening to block bridges \u2013 or, in the case of the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, even calling for a general strike. They believe it will only help them paint their opponents as extremists as they draw up the battle lines for the coming general election. The backing of Rudd and the few other erstwhile remainers who are still onboard the Boris bandwagon is heavily conditional on his insistence that all this parliamentary hardball is ultimately aimed at getting a Brexit deal through parliament. \u201cAmber will take a lot if it leads to a deal,\u201d said an ally.

While Davidson insisted that her departure had as much to do with motherhood as Brexit, it underlined the sense that the Johnson administration is a very long way from David Cameron\u2019s detoxified 2010 Tories. Johnson told his cabinet there was a 50/50 chance of a deal, and Brussels-watchers say there is just a glimmer of an opportunity opening up.

Johnson and his opponents will spend the weekend preparing for the dramatic constitutional clash that will be played out in the chambers of the Palace of Westminster when MPs return from their summer break next Tuesday. Few of them doubt that the ultimate battle will have to be fought at the polls.",

It was a coincidence, however, that on the same day the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2019/mark-carney-speech-at-jackson-hole-economic-symposium-wyoming\" title=\"\">warned</a> the annual gathering of the world\u2019s central bankers that the global economy was becoming over-reliant on the dollar.

Yet the problem is that before any currency can replace the dollar, world markets have to develop a great deal of trust in a new international lender of last resort. Right now that is the US Fed \u2013 which is why Mr Trump\u2019s attacks are so disconcerting. The president\u2019s failure to grasp macroeconomics is <a href=\"https://reason.com/2019/08/02/the-trade-deficit-keeps-growing-and-heres-three-other-data-points-showing-trump-is-losing-his-trade-war/\" title=\"\">terrifying</a>.

That is what happened in 1971. Mr Carney echoed this sentiment in his speech, noting \u201cpast instances of very low rates have tended to coincide with high-risk events such as wars, financial crises and breaks in the monetary regime\u201d. Mr Trump\u2019s concern that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-trump/trump-thinks-dollar-is-too-strong-blames-fed-policy-official-idUSKCN1TQ2FP\" title=\"\">the dollar is too strong</a> may be reasonable.

Anderson, his country\u2019s all-time leading wicket-taker, was a notable absentee when England named their squad for next week\u2019s fourth Ashes Test at his home ground of Old Trafford. Craig Overton was instead added to an otherwise unchanged 13-man party. It means both Jason Roy and Jos Buttler have retained their places despite underwhelming returns with the bat so far in the series.

The 37-year-old was expected to return for the fourth Test after he stepped up his recovery playing in a friendly for Lancashire\u2019s second XI against Durham this week. However, after bowling 20 overs at Chester on Tuesday, he pulled up on Thursday with further pain in his right calf and assessments by England\u2019s medical team have ruled him out of the rest of the series.

Chris Woakes, who would have made way if Anderson had been passed fit, is the most likely to be stood down.

On Friday, police detained pro-democracy lawmakers and activists, including Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, student leaders of pro-democracy protests in 2014. The pair were charged with unlawful assembly and released on bail. Police said 28 people were arrested. Critics say the mass arrests on the eve of a big rally planned for Saturday are aimed at dissuading protesters who have come out on to the streets for the last 12 weekends, demanding the withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill among other demands. \u201cThis is part and parcel of a new round of oppression against the movement,\u201d said Kenneth Chan, a professor in the department of government at Hong Kong Baptist University. \u201cThe arrest of other known leaders is meant to intimidate others,\u201d he said.

The protests, triggered in June by a proposed bill that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China, have evolved into a broader democracy movement challenging Beijing\u2019s authority over the city. China\u2019s warnings towards Hong Kong have grown increasingly ominous and the Chinese military has held several rounds of exercises across the border from Hong Kong. But experts say military intervention is Beijing\u2019s last option, choosing instead to rely on the Hong Kong authorities to stop the protests. \u201cWe are in a stage where Beijing is increasingly trying to impose costs. It\u2019s fairly clear Beijing has decided to adopt a hardline tactic, using the Hong Kong police, encouraging tougher tactics against protesters, and prosecuting them,\u201d said Adam Ni, who researches China at Macquarie University in Australia. Observers say both the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities are anxious to end the demonstrations before 1 October, when China celebrates 70 years of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, a politically significant holiday for the ruling Chinese communist party. The movement has been largely leaderless \u2013 in part to prevent the authorities from targeting particular individuals. Wong and Chow, now of the pro-democracy political organisation Demosist\u014d, have been active in the protests but neither are considered key figures. Others reportedly arrested include the former student leader Althea Suen, district councillor of Shatin, Rick Hui Yiu-yu, and New Territories West legislator Cheng Chung-tai.

It\u2019s a very visible signal to the protesters that there will be a cost for you, that we will keep arresting these people who continue to protest and resist,\u201d said Ni.

Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker who has been active in the demonstrations, posted on Facebook on Friday evening to alert friends that he had not been arrested. \u201cThank you for your concern, see you tomorrow on Hong Kong island!\u201d he said, suggesting he would be at the protests on Saturday. Activists publicly involved in the protests have in some cases been physically attacked. On Thursday, Jimmy Sham, the convener of the Civil Human Rights Front \u2013 the group organising the march \u2013 was attacked inside a restaurant by two masked men wielding baseball bats and knives. Another protester, Max Chung, who organised a march in Yuen Long last month, was beaten by four men wielding rods. The organisers of Saturday\u2019s march, which police had banned, called off the event on Friday fearing mass arrests, but groups of defiant protesters have called for people to come out anyway. \u201cHongkongers are not afraid. More suppression just leads to more opposition,\u201d one user commented on a protest forum. Another wrote: \u201cEven if they bring the tanks out, I will be there.\u201d Some fear the authorities intend to provoke protesters, creating more public anger and chaos on the streets, as a way to justify enacting the emergency law \u2013 a move that would severely damage Hong Kong\u2019s reputation as a global business and finance hub. \u201cThe authorities, Carrie Lam in particular, definitely understand that this whole thing could backfire. They could actually be adding more fuel to the fire, and more people will come out,\u201d said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker. \u201cThey can\u2019t lose. It\u2019s very calculated on their part,\u201d she said. Saturday\u2019s rally was meant to mark five years since Beijing\u2019s proposal for direct elections in Hong Kong, which would only allow candidates screened by Beijing. That proposal sparked mass protests known as the umbrella movement. Many of those in this summer\u2019s demonstrations attended the 2014 protests as young students. Demonstrators planned to gather for a religious rally on Saturday, which requires police approval if more than 30 people attend. University and secondary students have called for a class boycott next week. Demonstrators have also called for a citywide strike on Monday and Tuesday. \u201cWe will not stop our fight. We shall never surrender,\u201d Wong said following his release on bail. \u201cHongkongers, together we stand together!\u201d he posted on Twitter. \u201cI urge the international community to send a clear message to President Xi Jinping: sending troops or using an emergency ordinance is not the way out. We will continue our fight no matter how they arrest or prosecute us.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Cross-party rebel MPs said they had new optimism that measures to stop a no-deal Brexit could pass both the Commons and the Lords before parliament is prorogued, as Labour\u2019s Tom Watson confirmed a potential bill had been drafted. Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the leading Conservative architects of plans to stop no deal, has said MPs do have time to pass legislation on it. However, MPs from different parties are believed to be still at odds over how to stop Boris Johnson from circumventing any new law \u2013 and crucially what the aim of any extension to article 50 should be, whether that be extra time for negotiations, a second referendum or a general election. Watson, who announced on Friday he was joining a legal challenge to stop the prorogation of parliament, said concrete plans were now in place. \u201cI have taken advice on legislative solutions to challenge the prime minister\u2019s action to stop us crashing out of the EU without a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI am in discussion with colleagues in other parties and a bill to achieve this outcome has been drafted.\u201d Letwin, who led efforts to stop no-deal Brexit this year by passing a bill with the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, said \u201cthere probably is time\u201d to get a measure to block a no-deal Brexit through parliament, involving MPs seizing control of the order paper to pass the bill in a matter of days. Opposition peers expect Tories in the Lords to attempt to filibuster the legislation, which must have passed through all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent before parliament is suspended or it will fall. The Labour leader in the upper house, Angela Smith, has been taking advice on procedural mechanisms for ensuring the government cannot prevent peers from sitting for as long as it takes to get the bill through. Labour peers have been put on a three-line whip for Wednesday to Friday next week. A Labour source in the Lords said: \u201cIf the Commons does pass the bill, the government should be in no doubt that the Lords will do all it can to protect the will of the elected house.\u201d In the Commons, a number of prominent Conservative MPs, including the former cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Rory Stewart, have indicated they will back the efforts next week but Letwin said he was not complacent about numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s a foolhardy person who predicts the number of MPs who will vote either way on an issue of this kind and we will just have to see whether we can acquire a majority of the required kind,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cI know that there are a number of my colleagues who feel \u2013 as I do \u2013 that a disorderly no-deal exit is a very bad idea, and they have in the past been willing to come and support efforts to prevent that happening and I very much hope that will happen again.\u201d A senior MP close to the rebels\u2019 discussions said all efforts would be focused on passing a bill forcing the government to request an extension, but there were still question marks over how long an extension should be and for what purpose. \u201cLabour and the frontbench want a general election, soft-Brexit Tories like Letwin don\u2019t want either a people\u2019s vote or a general election and a significant number of the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] won\u2019t vote for a referendum either,\u201d the MP said. \u201cIf the legislation is vague, as it was in the Cooper bill in April \u2013 where the extension length was unspecified \u2013 Boris could simply ask for another six hours\u2019 extension and satisfy the legal requirement.\u201d Letwin denied reports that the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, had broken off his family holiday to discuss \u201ccooking up plans\u201d with him to stop parliament being prorogued but said the pair had been in contact. \u201cThere\u2019s no question of any MP cooking up any deal with the Speaker. You cannot do that. The Speaker has to follow the rules,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. But he added: \u201cI have talked to the Speaker and the clerks on many occasions and will continue to do so.\u201d On Friday, Johnson told MPs that efforts to stop no-deal in parliament were detrimental to his attempts to secure concessions from the EU. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the more our friends and partners think at the back of their minds that Brexit could be stopped, that the UK could be kept in, by parliament, the less likely they are to give us the deal that we need,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s why I really hope that MPs will allow the UK to do a deal and to get ready for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and that\u2019s the best way forward for our country.\u201d EU officials remain concerned that the UK has so far presented no concrete proposals for replacing the backstop \u2013 the insurance policy for avoiding a hard border in Ireland, which Johnson has described as undemocratic. Johnson hopes to strike a deal at a key meeting of the European council on 17 October, and will then give MPs the chance to vote on it the following week, just days before the Halloween Brexit deadline. He insisted they would have \u201ca lot of time\u201d to debate the issues. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up to the last period before we leave on 31 October, and in that period, parliament is going to have a lot of time, still \u2013 and they\u2019ve spent three years debating Brexit by the way, without actually getting it over the line,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have a lot of time for consideration, and what I want to do now, which I think is what most people in the country want the government to do, is get on and try and get an agreement, but if we can\u2019t get an agreement, get ready to come out anyway.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "James R Leavelle, the detective who was handcuffed to Lee Harvey Oswald when the killer of John F Kennedy was in turn shot dead by Jack Ruby, has died. He was 99. Leavelle\u2019s daughter, Karla Leavelle, confirmed her father\u2019s death to the New York Times. Kennedy was shot dead on 22 November 1963, as he passed through Dallas. Reporting for the Guardian, Alistair Cooke wrote: \u201cThe motorcade was going along slowly but smoothly when three muffled shots, which the crowd first mistook for fireworks, cracked through the cheers. One hit the shoulder blade and the wrist of Governor [John] Connally [of Texas] who was taken with the president to the hospital, where his condition is serious. \u201cThe other brought blood trickling from the temple of the sitting president. His right arm flopped from a high wave of greeting and he collapsed into the arms of Mrs Kennedy, who fell unharmed. She was heard to cry \u2018Oh no\u2019 and sat there all the way cradling his head in her lap.\u201d Kennedy was declared dead at Parkland Hospital. Two days later Oswald, then a suspect in the shooting of a police officer but not yet formally tied to the murder of the president, was led through the basement of a Dallas police station. Ruby, a nightclub owner who has long been rumoured to have had ties to the Mob, lunged forward and shot him. A Dallas Times Herald photographer, Bob Jackson, captured the flash of the moment, the burly, Stetson-hatted Leavelle recoiling from the shot, Oswald crumpled by it, Ruby lunging forward with his pistol clearly visible. The image won a Pulitzer Prize. The Times reported that Leavelle often discussed an exchange with Oswald shortly before the assassin himself was assassinated. \u201cLee,\u201d Leavelle said in the version of the story quoted by the Times, \u201cif anybody shoots at you, I hope they are as good a shot as you.\u201d Oswald, he said, replied: \u201cYou\u2019re being melodramatic.\u201d In 2013, Leavelle told the New York Daily News Oswald said \u201cNobody\u2019s gonna shoot at me\u201d. \u201cFamous last words,\u201d Leavelle said. In 2006, Leavelle told the Times that after his exchange with his prisoner, he saw \u201cout of the corner of my eye\u201d that Ruby \u201chad a pistol by his side\u201d. \u201cI jerked back on Oswald to get him behind me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had my hand through his belt. All I succeeded in doing, I turned him so instead of dead centre the bullet hit four inches to the left of his navel and two inches above.\u201d Oswald was declared dead in the same hospital as Kennedy. Ruby received the death penalty but died before sentence could be carried out. In 2017, files declassified by order of President Donald Trump showed that the night before the shooting, the FBI received a call about a plot to kill Oswald in Dallas. In a memo written on 24 November, the day of Oswald\u2019s death, then FBI director J Edgar Hoover said: \u201cWe at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection. This morning we called the chief of police again warning of the possibility of some effort against Oswald and again he assured us adequate protection would be given. \u201cHowever, this was not done.\u201d Leavelle served in the US navy in the second world war, surviving the attack on Pearl Harbor before sustaining an injury at sea.

      "body": "<p>And so one of the longest running dramas in British political history reaches yet another act. Some of the cast are locked into much the same roles as ever: Gina Miller is once again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/29/proroguing-parliament-precedent-boris-johnson-high-court\" title=\"\">striding off to the courts</a>; the great urban remain armies are turning out with their homemade placards, while the People\u2019s Vote campaign <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnharris1969/status/1167407645893910528\" title=\"\">sends out emails</a> signed by Michael Heseltine; front-rank Tory politicians are apparently prepared to trade in whatever faint principles they once claimed to hold dear, in the hope of holding their party together, whatever the price.</p> <p>Other characters seem to be changing. Jeremy Corbyn and his aides may have belatedly discovered the art of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/27/brexit-jeremy-corbyn-prioritise-legislation-stop-no-deal-meeting-opposition-parties-labour\" title=\"\">reaching out to people</a> beyond their inner circle. Militant Labourites who have mostly affected indifference about Brexit and told us that parliament was a rat\u2019s nest of ruling class interests stuffed full of centrists are suddenly barging their way to the front, suddenly convinced that the traditions of representative democracy might actually be worth defending.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that senior politicians break the rules and do whatever they want is, to use a modern phrase, priced in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That this is a moment of huge importance and Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament is outrageous are beyond doubt. But in the resulting noise about an alleged coup and the need to take to the streets, too much of the country remains uninterested, and plenty of other people have concluded that Johnson has done the right thing. Listen to the voices my Guardian colleague Ben Quinn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/its-fearmongering-talk-of-coup-fails-to-impress-brexit-backing-grays\" title=\"\">heard this week</a> in the Brexit-supporting constituency of Thurrock: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s undemocratic: not finally delivering on what the people voted for back in 2016 \u2026 the MPs need to deliver what the people voted for, and if he thinks that he can do it this way then people are not really going to care.\u201d On Friday, I had a conversation with a leave-voting friend who said that both sides of the Brexit argument had long since tumbled into farce and perhaps the referendum should never have happened, but he seemed prepared to give the prime minister the benefit of the doubt. \u201cAt least he\u2019s getting stuff done,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing.\u201d</p> <p>These are the people at the centre of Johnson\u2019s thoughts \u2013 and for him, trampling over some of the most basic tenets of democracy comes easy. To believe in the sanctity of parliament and understand the dangers of the current moment involves a certain mixture of humility, deference and aversion to danger \u2013 precisely the qualities that Eton, Oxford and an apparently deep belief in his own brilliance and the idea of politics as a mere game were always going to rule out. David Cameron had some of the same stuff, exemplified by his \u201cFlashman\u201d persona and the idiotic decision to call the 2016 referendum in the first place. But Johnson is something else again. Encouraged by his close adviser, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a> (who seems to me not so much the genius of Tory imaginings, but someone who has cottoned on to the fact that if the modern political right is to win, it has to be utterly reckless), he has seemingly decided not just that Brexit must happen at the end of October, but that what he does between now and the conclusion of a general election will be based on the supposed division between \u201cthe people\u201d and parliament, with the latter portrayed as the acme of all the liberal arrogance that Brexiteers have projected on to remain supporters.</p> <p>It says something about the decay of our most basic democratic institutions that the House of Commons presents such an easy target. If we have had any recent national conversation about the state of our democracy, by far the loudest voices have been those dismal provocateurs concentrated in the rightwing press, who would have you believe that MPs are corrupt, entitled people who should be paid as little as possible. For these people, Brexit was a gift: a chance to take the supposed division to its logical conclusion, while performing a classic act of bullying: giving a body of people an impossible job, and then raging at them for their inability to do it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a20fe4e9412ccfa3bbe49c3cf4a3f68bd4a13f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a20fe4e9412ccfa3bbe49c3cf4a3f68bd4a13f0/0_18_3009_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FILE - In this July 27, 2019, file photo, Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks during a speech on domestic priorities at the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester, England. Johnson is gambling his future on the audacious proposition that he can blunt an effort to halt his Brexit plan by simply suspending \u201cthe mother of all parliaments\u201d for key weeks ahead of the Oct. 31 departure date.

For all that it remains the best model of government and politics human beings have yet come up with, in the 21st century, representative democracy is a very tough sell. When people spend half their lives online and can experience at least the sensation of agency and instant gratification, the idea that we elect MPs to exercise their own judgment and then eventually submit their record for approval or rejection can easily seem woefully old-fashioned. I have lost count of the number of people I have met over the last few years who have angrily told me that the function of the Commons was to simply \u201cdo our bidding\u201d.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/08/13/are-mps-elected-exercise-their-own-judgement-or-do\" title=\"\">recent YouGov poll</a>, 63% of respondents agreed that MPs must \u201cact according to the wishes of their constituents, even when this goes against their own judgment\u201d, a figure that reached 78% among leave voters and \u2013 at which point Edmund Burke spins in his grave \u2013 81% of Tory supporters. It is no accident that, like so many populist forces, Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party claims to be in favour of direct democracy. Whatever its dangers, it is an idea that may be perfectly suited to a future of easy and instant everything, and the clarion call Amazon now suggests its customers ask their digital assistants: \u201cAlexa, where\u2019s my stuff?\u201d</p> <p>And so to something even more insidious. It is right to rage at a prime minister behaving arbitrarily and unaccountably, but also worth noting that there are plenty of other recent examples. It is less than 20 years since the UK was taken to war on the basis of a set of lies, which is one of the reasons why the central presence in the People\u2019s Vote campaign of Tony Blair and some his former aides and allies is so damaging. If you want to experience power without constraint as a daily experience, try being a benefit claimant.

      "bodyText": "And so one of the longest running dramas in British political history reaches yet another act. Some of the cast are locked into much the same roles as ever: Gina Miller is once again striding off to the courts; the great urban remain armies are turning out with their homemade placards, while the People\u2019s Vote campaign sends out emails signed by Michael Heseltine; front-rank Tory politicians are apparently prepared to trade in whatever faint principles they once claimed to hold dear, in the hope of holding their party together, whatever the price. Other characters seem to be changing. Jeremy Corbyn and his aides may have belatedly discovered the art of reaching out to people beyond their inner circle. Militant Labourites who have mostly affected indifference about Brexit and told us that parliament was a rat\u2019s nest of ruling class interests stuffed full of centrists are suddenly barging their way to the front, suddenly convinced that the traditions of representative democracy might actually be worth defending. That this is a moment of huge importance and Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament is outrageous are beyond doubt. But in the resulting noise about an alleged coup and the need to take to the streets, too much of the country remains uninterested, and plenty of other people have concluded that Johnson has done the right thing. Listen to the voices my Guardian colleague Ben Quinn heard this week in the Brexit-supporting constituency of Thurrock: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s undemocratic: not finally delivering on what the people voted for back in 2016 \u2026 the MPs need to deliver what the people voted for, and if he thinks that he can do it this way then people are not really going to care.\u201d On Friday, I had a conversation with a leave-voting friend who said that both sides of the Brexit argument had long since tumbled into farce and perhaps the referendum should never have happened, but he seemed prepared to give the prime minister the benefit of the doubt. \u201cAt least he\u2019s getting stuff done,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing.\u201d These are the people at the centre of Johnson\u2019s thoughts \u2013 and for him, trampling over some of the most basic tenets of democracy comes easy. To believe in the sanctity of parliament and understand the dangers of the current moment involves a certain mixture of humility, deference and aversion to danger \u2013 precisely the qualities that Eton, Oxford and an apparently deep belief in his own brilliance and the idea of politics as a mere game were always going to rule out. David Cameron had some of the same stuff, exemplified by his \u201cFlashman\u201d persona and the idiotic decision to call the 2016 referendum in the first place. But Johnson is something else again. Encouraged by his close adviser, Dominic Cummings (who seems to me not so much the genius of Tory imaginings, but someone who has cottoned on to the fact that if the modern political right is to win, it has to be utterly reckless), he has seemingly decided not just that Brexit must happen at the end of October, but that what he does between now and the conclusion of a general election will be based on the supposed division between \u201cthe people\u201d and parliament, with the latter portrayed as the acme of all the liberal arrogance that Brexiteers have projected on to remain supporters. It says something about the decay of our most basic democratic institutions that the House of Commons presents such an easy target. If we have had any recent national conversation about the state of our democracy, by far the loudest voices have been those dismal provocateurs concentrated in the rightwing press, who would have you believe that MPs are corrupt, entitled people who should be paid as little as possible. For these people, Brexit was a gift: a chance to take the supposed division to its logical conclusion, while performing a classic act of bullying: giving a body of people an impossible job, and then raging at them for their inability to do it. But there is also something deeper at play. For all that it remains the best model of government and politics human beings have yet come up with, in the 21st century, representative democracy is a very tough sell. When people spend half their lives online and can experience at least the sensation of agency and instant gratification, the idea that we elect MPs to exercise their own judgment and then eventually submit their record for approval or rejection can easily seem woefully old-fashioned. I have lost count of the number of people I have met over the last few years who have angrily told me that the function of the Commons was to simply \u201cdo our bidding\u201d. In a recent YouGov poll, 63% of respondents agreed that MPs must \u201cact according to the wishes of their constituents, even when this goes against their own judgment\u201d, a figure that reached 78% among leave voters and \u2013 at which point Edmund Burke spins in his grave \u2013 81% of Tory supporters. It is no accident that, like so many populist forces, Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party claims to be in favour of direct democracy. Whatever its dangers, it is an idea that may be perfectly suited to a future of easy and instant everything, and the clarion call Amazon now suggests its customers ask their digital assistants: \u201cAlexa, where\u2019s my stuff?\u201d And so to something even more insidious. It is right to rage at a prime minister behaving arbitrarily and unaccountably, but also worth noting that there are plenty of other recent examples. It is less than 20 years since the UK was taken to war on the basis of a set of lies, which is one of the reasons why the central presence in the People\u2019s Vote campaign of Tony Blair and some his former aides and allies is so damaging. If you want to experience power without constraint as a daily experience, try being a benefit claimant. Given the broken state of most local government, moreover, most people inevitably understand power as something located in distant, unreachable places. As a result, the idea that senior politicians break the rules and do whatever they want is, to use a modern phrase, priced in; what makes the difference between winning and losing is the stories they weave into their manoeuvres, which is Johnson\u2019s basic calculation. These things threaten to further the development of a turbulent, volatile, almost amoral politics. If we are going to stand any chance of averting such disasters, we will have to not just make the case for representative government, but rebuild and reform the local, regional and national institutions of our democracy, a task every bit as urgent as the need to make the UK more economically equal, and one that the political left has so far not paid nearly enough attention to. In contrast to the forces on the other side who are currently running rampant, so far, we have neither the ideas nor the language to even start \u2013 so, in the meantime, politics is going to carry on channelling awful division and opening up profound dangers. To paraphrase the 20th-century communist Antonio Gramsci, it is not so much that the old world is dying and the new cannot be born: it is that the only vivid and coherent vision of the future of power and politics on offer is currently being offered by irresponsible chancers, whose chief concern is not the ghouls they are letting loose, but their own survival. Their opportunity lies in the chasm between this week\u2019s protests and the millions of people who either avert their eyes or see them as so much liberal, remainer nonsense; it is also our side\u2019s greatest challenge, whose urgency, even now, has yet to sink in. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Sir Dawda Jawara, who has died aged 95, was the first leader of the small west African country of the Gambia when it became independent in 1965. Although he was hailed as a rare democratic leader at a time when Africa was better known for military regimes and single-party states, he was twice overthrown in military putsches.</p> <p>The first time, in 1981, he was reinstated as president by troops from neighbouring Senegal, while the second time, in 1994, nobody came to his aid and he left the country for eight years. But he was still well respected, and on his death was acknowledged by the current democratically elected president, Adama Barrow, as the Gambia\u2019s founding father. </p> <p>The Gambia was the last country in west Africa to achieve independence from Britain and, like many other former British colonies, initially had Queen Elizabeth as head of state represented by a governor general. In 1966 Jawara\u2019s People\u2019s Progressive party won 24 of the 32 seats in the national assembly, and he was knighted in 1966. Four years later a referendum led to the Gambia becoming a republic within the Commonwealth. Jawara became executive president, and in 1972 won a landslide electoral victory. </p> <p>For the next 20 years the PPP dominated the political landscape, other opposition parties never building serious support. Jawara\u2019s instincts were always for a pro-western liberal democracy. A persuasive speaker, his mild manner and occasional air of indecision masked a ruthless streak when his power was threatened.</p> <p>During the 1970s the country supplemented its groundnut economy by diversification, with a prosperous tourism business. There was also a bonus from the informal economy, which the Gambia\u2019s neighbours in Senegal saw as taking advantage of the enclave nature of the Gambia\u2019s geography (it was described as an \u201carrow pointed at the heart of Senegal\u201d). Although the two countries agreed on a cooperation treaty with a joint secretariat, hawks in Senegal advocated a more robust approach, with closer Senegalese influence over the Gambia\u2019s affairs.</p> <p>Their opportunity came as Jawara ran into political trouble in 1981 through complacency. The weak link was the Field Force \u2013 a glorified police unit established at independence because Jawara had not wanted a fully-fledged army.</p> <p>Even a Field Force can develop discontents, and in July 1981, when Jawara was in London for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, a Field Force mutiny led to a Senegalese military intervention, to put down what had become an attempted coup. The mutineers were linked to a group of radicals led by <a href=\"https://gainako.com/kukoi-samba-sanyang-controversial-1981-rebel-leader-reportedly-dead/\" title=\"\">Kukoi Samba Sanyang</a>, and had taken a number of hostages, including the president\u2019s senior wife. After the Senegalese intervention, when the rebels fled or were arrested, she was released by a unit of the British SAS.</p> <p>The attempted putsch diminished Jawara\u2019s prestige, especially as there had been a heavy loss of life. The price of Senegal\u2019s intervention was not just a continued military presence but also the establishment in 1982 of a Senegambian Confederation, in which Senegal\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abdou-Diouf\" title=\"\">Abdou Diouf</a>, was confederal president, with Jawara as his vice-president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bebbef0d246ecad2c2ed8f5b56c0d74a50d49e2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bebbef0d246ecad2c2ed8f5b56c0d74a50d49e2d/0_92_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Dawda Jawara, rear centre, with other delegates to the Commonwealth prime ministers\u2019 conference at Marlborough House, London, 1969.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Dawda Jawara, rear centre, with other delegates to the Commonwealth prime ministers\u2019 conference at Marlborough House, London, 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The confederation was not popular in the Gambia, not least because for the first time the country had an army (as part of a confederal force) and when, in 1989, Senegal clashed with its northern neighbour Mauritania, Jawara chose to force a crisis over confederal institutions. Diouf could have resisted, but he let the Gambia withdraw peacefully from the confederation. However, the Senegalese never forgave Jawara\u2019s defiance.</p> <p>At the 1991 PPP congress Jawara proposed that he would not stand at the next election. After a wave of emotion in the party, he abandoned his attempt, and ran again for another term. However, in July 1994 a bloodless coup was staged by a young lieutenant in the military police, Yahya Jammeh, who had returned from training in the US two months before.</p> <p>In an interview in his house in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, three months later, Jawara told me the US ambassador had offered him sanctuary on a US naval vessel that had been carrying out joint exercises with the Gambians. He had thought it was a tactical move, but he found that all his family had already been evacuated to the vessel. However, he did not allege US complicity.</p> <p>Jawara was born at Barajally on <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/MacCarthy-Island\" title=\"\">MacCarthy Island</a> in the Gambia river.

      "bodyText": "Sir Dawda Jawara, who has died aged 95, was the first leader of the small west African country of the Gambia when it became independent in 1965. Although he was hailed as a rare democratic leader at a time when Africa was better known for military regimes and single-party states, he was twice overthrown in military putsches. The first time, in 1981, he was reinstated as president by troops from neighbouring Senegal, while the second time, in 1994, nobody came to his aid and he left the country for eight years. But he was still well respected, and on his death was acknowledged by the current democratically elected president, Adama Barrow, as the Gambia\u2019s founding father. The Gambia was the last country in west Africa to achieve independence from Britain and, like many other former British colonies, initially had Queen Elizabeth as head of state represented by a governor general. In 1966 Jawara\u2019s People\u2019s Progressive party won 24 of the 32 seats in the national assembly, and he was knighted in 1966. Four years later a referendum led to the Gambia becoming a republic within the Commonwealth. Jawara became executive president, and in 1972 won a landslide electoral victory. For the next 20 years the PPP dominated the political landscape, other opposition parties never building serious support. Jawara\u2019s instincts were always for a pro-western liberal democracy. A persuasive speaker, his mild manner and occasional air of indecision masked a ruthless streak when his power was threatened. During the 1970s the country supplemented its groundnut economy by diversification, with a prosperous tourism business. There was also a bonus from the informal economy, which the Gambia\u2019s neighbours in Senegal saw as taking advantage of the enclave nature of the Gambia\u2019s geography (it was described as an \u201carrow pointed at the heart of Senegal\u201d). Although the two countries agreed on a cooperation treaty with a joint secretariat, hawks in Senegal advocated a more robust approach, with closer Senegalese influence over the Gambia\u2019s affairs. Their opportunity came as Jawara ran into political trouble in 1981 through complacency. The weak link was the Field Force \u2013 a glorified police unit established at independence because Jawara had not wanted a fully-fledged army. Even a Field Force can develop discontents, and in July 1981, when Jawara was in London for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, a Field Force mutiny led to a Senegalese military intervention, to put down what had become an attempted coup. The mutineers were linked to a group of radicals led by Kukoi Samba Sanyang, and had taken a number of hostages, including the president\u2019s senior wife. After the Senegalese intervention, when the rebels fled or were arrested, she was released by a unit of the British SAS. The attempted putsch diminished Jawara\u2019s prestige, especially as there had been a heavy loss of life. The price of Senegal\u2019s intervention was not just a continued military presence but also the establishment in 1982 of a Senegambian Confederation, in which Senegal\u2019s president, Abdou Diouf, was confederal president, with Jawara as his vice-president. The confederation was not popular in the Gambia, not least because for the first time the country had an army (as part of a confederal force) and when, in 1989, Senegal clashed with its northern neighbour Mauritania, Jawara chose to force a crisis over confederal institutions. Diouf could have resisted, but he let the Gambia withdraw peacefully from the confederation. However, the Senegalese never forgave Jawara\u2019s defiance. At the 1991 PPP congress Jawara proposed that he would not stand at the next election. After a wave of emotion in the party, he abandoned his attempt, and ran again for another term. However, in July 1994 a bloodless coup was staged by a young lieutenant in the military police, Yahya Jammeh, who had returned from training in the US two months before. In an interview in his house in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, three months later, Jawara told me the US ambassador had offered him sanctuary on a US naval vessel that had been carrying out joint exercises with the Gambians. He had thought it was a tactical move, but he found that all his family had already been evacuated to the vessel. However, he did not allege US complicity. Jawara was born at Barajally on MacCarthy Island in the Gambia river. Originally named Saikou Almami, he was one of six children of a Mandinka trader. Although the family was Muslim, he was sent to the colony\u2019s capital, Bathurst (now Banjul), to stay with a friend of the family, a trader, while he went to the Methodist boys\u2019 grammar school. After working as a trainee nurse for a year, he went to study science at Achimota in the then Gold Coast (now Ghana). From there he won a scholarship to Glasgow University in 1948 to train as a veterinary surgeon, the first Gambian to do so. After qualifying in 1953, he returned home to work as a veterinary officer for the next six years. At Glasgow he was president of the African Students Union. After converting from Islam to Christianity in 1955, he took the name David and married the daughter of the speaker of the Gambia\u2019s house of assembly, Sir John Mahoney. His wife, Augusta, helped launch him into local politics. However, his reconversion to Islam in 1965 led to their divorce, and his marriage to two more wives. In 1959 he joined an upcountry group called the Protectorate People\u2019s party and soon became its leader, changing its name to the People\u2019s Progressive party. He stood for election in 1960, won his seat and was appointed minister of education, but resigned when PS Njie, the leader of the other main political party, was chosen as the transitional chief minister although the PPP had won more seats. The British, by then intent on decolonising this poverty-stricken country of half a million people, brought in a new constitution for independence. After further elections in May 1962, the PPP won a narrow majority, and Jawara became chief minister. After self-government came in October 1963, he was prime minister. The British, working with the French and the Senegalese, brought in the United Nations to report on prospects for independence, and, though a federal union with Senegal was recommended as the best option, the young turks in Jawara\u2019s own party pressed him to opt for going it alone.

His return permitted him to enjoy some minor standing as a retired statesman, and in 2010 he published Kairaba, an autobiography.

      "body": "<p>To Daniel Levy, the numbers added up, and to Jack Clarke, the 18-year-old Leeds winger, it was a dream move, the chance to continue his development at Tottenham in the Premier League. Levy had been alerted to Clarke\u2019s potential by statistical analysis of his performances last season and, at a cost of around \u00a310m rising to \u00a311.5m, the Spurs chairman felt it all made sense.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/30/jack-clarke-tottenham-leeds-united-mauricio-pochettino-ryan-sessegnon\" title=\"\">Levy closed the deal at the end of June</a> but there would be one problem: Mauricio Pochettino did not want Clarke in his squad this season. Leeds had asked for a loan-back at the beginning of the negotiations only to be told by Levy there was no chance of it happening. It was never on the table and then, all of a sudden, it was.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/30/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Clarke came to London, posed for pictures with the Spurs shirt and headed straight back on the train to Leeds where he is contracted to spend the season on loan. Spurs have a recall option in January.</p> \n<p>It has come to feel a little awkward for Clarke, who was considered to be a fine impact substitute during his debut season last time out, particularly ideal to throw on when Leeds were chasing a game. He made 22 Championship appearances, 18 off the bench.</p> \n<p>This season Clarke has yet to kick a ball in the league. He was an unused substitute in Leeds\u2019s first two matches in the competition and he has not been in the squad for the past three. He has started twice in the Carabao Cup but was taken off at half-time against Stoke on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>The problem has been that Leeds have six loan players and, under Championship rules, can name only five in the match-day squad. Ben White and Jack Harrison are first choices, Illan Meslier is the backup goalkeeper and Eddie Nketiah and Helder Costa are ahead of Clarke in the pecking order.</p> \n<p>There will surely be injuries and suspensions to the loanees, together with fluctuations in form, but, at present, Clarke\u2019s situation is a long way from being ideal for him or Spurs.</p> \n<p>The story raises all sorts of questions at Spurs, one of which relates to the functionality of their recruitment strategy. Levy wanted Clarke, he saw him as a useful squad member and paid a fair amount of money for him, but Pochettino would not even look at the player in training. It is inconceivable that Pochettino did not discuss Clarke\u2019s readiness for the Premier League with Marcelo Bielsa, the Leeds manager and his mentor.</p> \n<p>What it certainly does do is shine a light on the sense that all has not been well at Spurs over the summer and goes some way towards explaining why Pochettino has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/tottenham-lacking-unity-desire-mauricio-pochettino\" title=\"\">so irritable of late</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edd1777ec685b3fd04fc1deabef3b052be5094dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edd1777ec685b3fd04fc1deabef3b052be5094dd/272_121_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mauricio Pochettino and Daniel Levy celebrate Spurs\u2019 passage to last season\u2019s Champions League final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mauricio Pochettino and Daniel Levy celebrate Spurs\u2019 passage to last season\u2019s Champions League final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Remember when Pochettino said at the end of July that the club ought to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/pochettino-spurs-job-title-tranfers-real-madrid-gareth-bale\" title=\"\">change his job title</a> back to coach from manager as he was in the dark over transfer activity? \u201cI am not in charge and I know nothing about the situation of my players,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham\" title=\"\">Pochettino said</a>. \u201cSell, buy players; sign contract, not sign contract \u2013 it is not in my hands. It is in the club\u2019s hands and Daniel Levy\u2019s hands.\u201d</p> \n<p>As he prepares for Sunday\u2019s visit to Arsenal, Pochettino is on familiar ground \u2013 burning with ambition but frustrated by sobering reality, which is principally shaped by finance. But there was also the sight of him moving to draw a line under the recent friction, to look ahead with optimism. Pochettino had dinner with Levy on Thursday and it was hard not to see the meeting as being designed to clear the air.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe talked about everything,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe needed to have a conversation last week and this week it was the same. The most important thing is to help the club and the team to perform and be on the same page. To communicate in a good place always helps.</p> \n<p>\u201cSometimes our vision in the professional side cannot be the same and sometimes [we] can have some disagreements. But the most important thing is that the personal relationship is still strong. This morning Daniel showed me a picture that we took on the last day at White Hart Lane where we are together with the coaching staff and his family and he said: \u2018Look, our personal relationship is still there.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Pochettino says that Spurs fans are now seeing \u201cversion 6.0\u201d of him, as he starts his sixth season with them, and he wanted the summer to mark a new beginning.</p> \n<p>Positive things did happen, especially the club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/02/tanguy-ndombele-tottenham-medical-lyon-roma-toby-alderweireld\" title=\"\">record \u00a355.5m signing of Tanguy Ndombele</a>, a player whom Pochettino had championed. Ryan Sessegnon joined for \u00a325m and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/ryan-sessegnon-set-to-join-tottenham-from-fulham-for-initial-25m\" title=\"\">Giovani Lo Celso signed on loan</a>. The net spend stands at \u00a359.9m, although the window remains open in many European countries.</p> \n<p>But in a summer in which Manchester City spent \u00a360m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/manchester-city-to-sign-joao-cancelo-from-juventus-with-danilo-part-of-deal\" title=\"\">on Jo\u00e3o Cancelo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/manchester-city-pay-rodri-release-clause-atletico-madrid-transfer-window-football\" title=\"\">\u00a362.6m on Rodri</a>, was it enough to lay the groundwork for a title push, to close the gap to the champions and Liverpool? Deep down, Pochettino knows the answer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c2888ec5-0845-4306-aa94-d27f4cabfb75\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SDitKia-8CY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pochettino is acutely aware that if Clarke was not ready, then Sessegnon, at 19, will need a season to assimilate. Ndombele, 22, and Lo Celso, 23, are also far from being the finished articles. Sessegnon arrived with a hamstring injury and has yet to work with the squad while Lo Celso had a disrupted pre-season.</p> \n<p>The rather glib reading of Spurs\u2019s summer is that they have finally signed some players and, having reached the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Champions League final in June</a>,are equipped to take the last step to glory. Pochettino knows he must manage this perception; that Spurs remain on a different track to City and Liverpool.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation the people can believe is that Tottenham was so active in the transfer market but be careful with that as we can create an expectation that is not real,\u201d Pochettino said last week. \u201cWe need to give time to the young players.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pochettino understands the market trends are for big clubs to sign younger players with potential; top internationals can be prohibitively expensive. And he understands how Spurs\u2019s lavish stadium has had an impact on transfer budgets. But it does not stop him from being frustrated or having the occasional moan.</p> \n<p>He can veer off-message in the emotional aftermath of a game and he did so last Sunday following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/tottenham-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 1-0 home defeat by Newcastle</a> when he complained he had never known his squad to be more unsettled at the start of a season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a37398cec4db100aa5693ae31217e167a2389b8a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a37398cec4db100aa5693ae31217e167a2389b8a/0_46_1197_718/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A big headache for Mauricio Pochettino is whether Christian Eriksen will leave before Monday\u2019s deadline.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A big headache for Mauricio Pochettino is whether Christian Eriksen will leave before Monday\u2019s deadline.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are problems with a clutch of players, the biggest headache for Pochettino being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/27/tottenham-uncertain-christian-eriksen-intentions\" title=\"\">whether Christian Eriksen will be prised away</a> before Monday\u2019s deadline.

Rose\u2019s next interview will be a good one. There is uncertainty, too, over Toby Alderweireld \u2013 another key player in his final year \u2013 and Serge Aurier and Victor Wanyama are up for sale.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pochettino is obsessed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/31/mauricio-pochettino-firewalking-arrows-tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">smooth flow of positive energy</a>; he cannot tolerate disturbances in the force and it is no wonder that he has been a little up and down. Plainly, some players have had or do have their minds elsewhere during the week. His post-Newcastle comment that unity in the squad was \u201cstill far, far away\u201d was a stark admission and the European transfer window cannot close soon enough. Pochettino needs to know who he can count on \u2013 and how quickly.</p> \n<p>Yet his pre-Arsenal message was one of passion and defiance. There were rumours on Thursday night that Pochettino was about to walk out on Spurs. To say that he gave them short shrift would be an understatement.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery single period needs to be put in context,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cMy position was always to make sure we can be competitive again. Of course, when you are not on the same page or side there\u2019s no point to be happy. Performances or results or some reality I describe in pre-season can change your perception of me but I am still the same person with the same principles and the same big heart.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "To Daniel Levy, the numbers added up, and to Jack Clarke, the 18-year-old Leeds winger, it was a dream move, the chance to continue his development at Tottenham in the Premier League. Levy had been alerted to Clarke\u2019s potential by statistical analysis of his performances last season and, at a cost of around \u00a310m rising to \u00a311.5m, the Spurs chairman felt it all made sense. Levy closed the deal at the end of June but there would be one problem: Mauricio Pochettino did not want Clarke in his squad this season. Leeds had asked for a loan-back at the beginning of the negotiations only to be told by Levy there was no chance of it happening. It was never on the table and then, all of a sudden, it was. Clarke came to London, posed for pictures with the Spurs shirt and headed straight back on the train to Leeds where he is contracted to spend the season on loan. Spurs have a recall option in January. It has come to feel a little awkward for Clarke, who was considered to be a fine impact substitute during his debut season last time out, particularly ideal to throw on when Leeds were chasing a game. He made 22 Championship appearances, 18 off the bench. This season Clarke has yet to kick a ball in the league. He was an unused substitute in Leeds\u2019s first two matches in the competition and he has not been in the squad for the past three. He has started twice in the Carabao Cup but was taken off at half-time against Stoke on Tuesday. The problem has been that Leeds have six loan players and, under Championship rules, can name only five in the match-day squad. Ben White and Jack Harrison are first choices, Illan Meslier is the backup goalkeeper and Eddie Nketiah and Helder Costa are ahead of Clarke in the pecking order. There will surely be injuries and suspensions to the loanees, together with fluctuations in form, but, at present, Clarke\u2019s situation is a long way from being ideal for him or Spurs. The story raises all sorts of questions at Spurs, one of which relates to the functionality of their recruitment strategy. Levy wanted Clarke, he saw him as a useful squad member and paid a fair amount of money for him, but Pochettino would not even look at the player in training. It is inconceivable that Pochettino did not discuss Clarke\u2019s readiness for the Premier League with Marcelo Bielsa, the Leeds manager and his mentor. What it certainly does do is shine a light on the sense that all has not been well at Spurs over the summer and goes some way towards explaining why Pochettino has been so irritable of late. Remember when Pochettino said at the end of July that the club ought to change his job title back to coach from manager as he was in the dark over transfer activity? \u201cI am not in charge and I know nothing about the situation of my players,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cSell, buy players; sign contract, not sign contract \u2013 it is not in my hands. It is in the club\u2019s hands and Daniel Levy\u2019s hands.\u201d As he prepares for Sunday\u2019s visit to Arsenal, Pochettino is on familiar ground \u2013 burning with ambition but frustrated by sobering reality, which is principally shaped by finance. But there was also the sight of him moving to draw a line under the recent friction, to look ahead with optimism. Pochettino had dinner with Levy on Thursday and it was hard not to see the meeting as being designed to clear the air. \u201cWe talked about everything,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe needed to have a conversation last week and this week it was the same. The most important thing is to help the club and the team to perform and be on the same page. To communicate in a good place always helps. \u201cSometimes our vision in the professional side cannot be the same and sometimes [we] can have some disagreements. But the most important thing is that the personal relationship is still strong. This morning Daniel showed me a picture that we took on the last day at White Hart Lane where we are together with the coaching staff and his family and he said: \u2018Look, our personal relationship is still there.\u2019\u201d Pochettino says that Spurs fans are now seeing \u201cversion 6.0\u201d of him, as he starts his sixth season with them, and he wanted the summer to mark a new beginning. Positive things did happen, especially the club record \u00a355.5m signing of Tanguy Ndombele, a player whom Pochettino had championed. Ryan Sessegnon joined for \u00a325m and Giovani Lo Celso signed on loan. The net spend stands at \u00a359.9m, although the window remains open in many European countries. But in a summer in which Manchester City spent \u00a360m on Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and \u00a362.6m on Rodri, was it enough to lay the groundwork for a title push, to close the gap to the champions and Liverpool? Deep down, Pochettino knows the answer. Pochettino is acutely aware that if Clarke was not ready, then Sessegnon, at 19, will need a season to assimilate. Ndombele, 22, and Lo Celso, 23, are also far from being the finished articles. Sessegnon arrived with a hamstring injury and has yet to work with the squad while Lo Celso had a disrupted pre-season. The rather glib reading of Spurs\u2019s summer is that they have finally signed some players and, having reached the Champions League final in June,are equipped to take the last step to glory. Pochettino knows he must manage this perception; that Spurs remain on a different track to City and Liverpool. \u201cThe situation the people can believe is that Tottenham was so active in the transfer market but be careful with that as we can create an expectation that is not real,\u201d Pochettino said last week. \u201cWe need to give time to the young players.\u201d Pochettino understands the market trends are for big clubs to sign younger players with potential; top internationals can be prohibitively expensive. And he understands how Spurs\u2019s lavish stadium has had an impact on transfer budgets. But it does not stop him from being frustrated or having the occasional moan. He can veer off-message in the emotional aftermath of a game and he did so last Sunday following the 1-0 home defeat by Newcastle when he complained he had never known his squad to be more unsettled at the start of a season. There are problems with a clutch of players, the biggest headache for Pochettino being whether Christian Eriksen will be prised away before Monday\u2019s deadline. Eriksen, who has entered the final year of his contract, has said that he is open to a new challenge. Jan Vertonghen, who is also in his last year, has not yet kicked a ball and what is going on with Danny Rose? He was left out of the tour of Asia to allow him to find a club but he did not do so and has since started in every Premier League game. Rose\u2019s next interview will be a good one. There is uncertainty, too, over Toby Alderweireld \u2013 another key player in his final year \u2013 and Serge Aurier and Victor Wanyama are up for sale. Pochettino is obsessed by the smooth flow of positive energy; he cannot tolerate disturbances in the force and it is no wonder that he has been a little up and down. Plainly, some players have had or do have their minds elsewhere during the week. His post-Newcastle comment that unity in the squad was \u201cstill far, far away\u201d was a stark admission and the European transfer window cannot close soon enough. Pochettino needs to know who he can count on \u2013 and how quickly. Yet his pre-Arsenal message was one of passion and defiance. There were rumours on Thursday night that Pochettino was about to walk out on Spurs. To say that he gave them short shrift would be an understatement. \u201cEvery single period needs to be put in context,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cMy position was always to make sure we can be competitive again. Of course, when you are not on the same page or side there\u2019s no point to be happy. Performances or results or some reality I describe in pre-season can change your perception of me but I am still the same person with the same principles and the same big heart.\u201d",

Every other advanced economy performed better than Britain in the second quarter of 2019, a ranking confirmed on Friday when Canada was the last of the seven to report GDP figures for the period between April and June. Canada topped the G7 with strong growth of 0.9% in the second quarter. The US and Japan both posted solid, if unspectacular, growth of 0.5% and 0.4% respectively. The UK brought up the rear, after contracting by 0.2% in the second quarter. Germany also shrank, by 0.1%, while France picked up pace with 0.3% growth. Italy stagnated with zero growth.

But economic prospects beyond 31 October depend entirely on Brexit. \u201cIf there is a no-deal Brexit, there will probably be a recession at the turn of the year,\u201d Gregory predicted. Global growth appears to have weakened in recent months as the ongoing US-China trade war hits demand. Gregory said there had been a slowdown in manufacturing across the world recently. \u201cThe big question is whether this weakness spills over to the consumer sector,\u201d she added.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI can\u2019t see [a woman managing a men\u2019s English professional team] in my lifetime. I think society isn\u2019t even ready for it let alone football and football is behind society. I can\u2019t see it because I think you would have to be 10 times as good and if you lost a game it would be because you were a woman and not because you hadn\u2019t got your game-plan right or that your goalkeeper has made an error. I don\u2019t think women are seen in society as equal yet so until women in society are seen as equal we are never going to be able to do that\u201d \u2013 Casey Stoney, Manchester United Women manager. RECOMMENDED LISTENING It\u2019s Football Weekly Extra! Again! FIVER LETTERS \u201cEternal youth, King Lear, and a Peaky Blinders cap? Eric Cantona might not be the gift that keeps on giving, but he\u2019s certainly the little red card the postie slips through the door to say he\u2019s popped your gift in the recycle bin.

I always hoped it would catch on when he came to Highbury, but instead we coined a bog standard chant based on his name. Ridiculously, this always left me feeling like we\u2019d missed out on an important opportunity\u201d \u2013 David Madden. \u201cIn the absence of those useful semi-colons that often feature, I couldn\u2019t work out whether \u201cFiver (Fiver Towers)\u201d had made the latest England squad as a striker or a midfielder, being situated as it was in the list between Harry Kane and some other not-Harry-Kane England extra. I wondered whether you saw yourself as more of a false 9, false 10, false 8, false 4 etc etc you get where I\u2019m going with this.

      "bodyText": "And finally, Britain\u2019s stock market has just posted its worth month in almost a year. The FTSE 100 has closed 22 points higher at 7207. That means the blue-chip index has lost 5% in August, following heavy losses earlier in the month. That\u2019s the worst monthly performance since October 2018, when the FTSE (by my maths) shed 5.08%. It\u2019s very nearly the worst month in four years (going back to August 2015, when it lost 6.7%). On that note, goodnight and have a great weekend. GW Newsflash: The euro has just hit its lowest level in over two years. The single currency has dropped through $1.1 against the US dollar for the first time since May 2017. I can\u2019t immediately see a single cause, but traders and investors are expecting fresh action from the European Central Bank to stimulate growth soon (especially with inflation remaining at just 1% in August, as we learned earlier). This will not please Donald Trump, who has been bashing the Federal Reserve again today for not cutting interest rates hard. I just spoke with Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, about the second-quarter growth figures. She points out that the UK economy was hit by certain one-off factors in the second quarter of 2019. For example: Brexit stockpiling boosted the economy at the start of the year, explaining why GDP rose by 0.5% in Q1. Car plants shut down in April, in case of a no-deal Brexit, rather than in the summer So while GDP fell by 0.2%, underlying growth was probably +0.2% [and underlying growth in Q1 was probably weaker]. She predicts that the UK economy will return to growth in the current quarter -- partly because of a second burst of stockpiling by companies worried about disruption after Brexit. But if it\u2019s a no-deal Brexit, Gregory fears the economy will contract in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, putting Britain into a full-blown recession. Although Canada\u2019s economy beat forecasts in the last quarter, some analysts are concerned that domestic demand weakened (although the surge in exports made up for it). The New York stock market has opened higher, following Europe\u2019s lead. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 114 points, or 0.4%, on optimism that the US and China might make some progress in their ongoing trade dispute. Traders are feeling more bullish after Beijing said yesterday it wouldn\u2019t immediately retaliate to the latest US tariffs, on 15% of over $100bn of imports, which kick in on Sunday. Britain\u2019s growth rate looks less disastrous if you take a longer-term view, though. The UK economy grew by 1.2% in Q2 2019 compared to a year earlier, the ONS reported earlier this month. That\u2019s pretty sluggish, but better than Germany\u2019s 0.4% year-on-year growth, or the 0.1% y/y contraction suffered by Italy. We now know for sure that Britain was the weakest-performing major advanced economy in the second quarter of 2019. Canada\u2019s GDP report completes the set of growth figures from the members of the G7, leaving the UK as the worst performer. Canada: Grew by 0.9% in Q2 vs Q1 US: Grew by 0.5% Japan: Grew by 0.4% France: Grew by 0.3% Italy: No growth during the quarter Germany: Contracted by 0.1% UK: Contracted by 0.2% Both the UK and Germany are thus on the brink of recession -- and would suffer that indignity if their economies also shrink in the current quarter (July-September). Britain\u2019s economy suffered from a drop in manufacturing activity in the last quarter, as the boost from Brexit stockpiling earlier in the year unwound. Germany, meanwhile, was hit by the US-China trade war which dented its exports and hurt factory orders. Newsflash: Canada\u2019s economy grew by 0.9% in the second quarter of the year, stronger than expected. GDP figures just released show that growth accelerated strongly in April-June, following just 0.1% growth in both the previous two quarters. Statistics Canada pointed to a rise in exports, including fuel, saying: Exports of goods rose 3.7% in the second quarter, following declines in previous two quarters. The increase was led by energy products, which grew 5.9% after a 3.0% decline in the first quarter. Exports of services rose 1.1%, maintaining the pace of the previous quarter. Import volumes declined 1.0%. This is the fastest quarterly growth in two years: President Donald Trump has started the day with a blast at General Motors for cutting its US workforce and moving operations to China. I think he\u2019s referring to a Bloomberg report that GM has fewer union-represented US workers than Ford or Fiat Chrysler for the first time since the unions started organising 80 years ago. The slowdown in consumer credit growth reported this morning comes as regulators clamp down on the sector. Yesterday, Amigo Loans warned that it didn\u2019t expect to grow its lending books this year, sending its shares sliding by over 50%. Amigo targets people with poor credit ratings, who can find a friend or relative to guarantee the loan will be repaid. It lends at an average APR of 49.9% - rather higher than the Bank of England base rate of 0.75%. Regulator are concerned about this sector, following an increase in the number of guarantors who are being asked to repay these debts. Some say they weren\u2019t fully aware what they were signing up to.... Good news for Tesla! The electric self-driving car maker is being given an exemption from China\u2019s auto purchase tax, according to reports. That tax is currently 10%, so this could helpTesla break into the Chinese car marker. Shares are up 3% in pre-market trading on Wall Street. Over in the eurozone, inflation remained stuck at its lowest level since 2016 this month, intensifying pressure on the European Central Bank to launch new stimulus measures. Consumer prices only rose by 1% in August, Eurostat reports, matching July\u2019s three-year low. Falling energy prices pulled the cost of living down, while food and alcohol prices rose faster. With inflation so far from the ECB\u2019s target, economists expect the central bank to cut the interest rates it pays commercial banks deeper into negative territory -- from -0.4% to -0.5%. But will that actually work? After all, the ECB has created trillions of new euros to buy up government bonds - driving prices to record highs but having little lasting impact on inflation or growth. Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, argues that governments need to stop relying on monetary policy, and pull the fiscal levers instead. Starting with Germany. She says: Even a sustained period of negative real interest rates has failed to drag inflation above 1%, the lowest level since 2016. With Germany on the brink of recession, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether the country will drop its adherence to Swartz Null, a balanced budget, and use Government spending, fiscal policy to support growth and hence ultimately higher inflation. As the UK\u2019s political turmoil and the US/ China trade wars continue to loom over the global economy, Germany will have to embrace others tools of growth to support what Draghi is doing on the monetary side.\u201d Michael Biemann, CEO of the digital property lender, Selina Finance, reckons some people have been racing to complete home purchases before a disorderly Brexit ruins their plans. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s mortgage approvals data: \u201cMortgage approvals for house purchase hit a two-year high in July, suggesting that our looming departure from the EU is causing people to act rather than sit on their hands. Nobody knows quite what will happen if we leave the EU at the end of October and so people are taking action now, while they are still in control. A lot of households are concerned that borrowing costs could rise in the event of a chaotic exit from the EU and that the high street banks might stop offering credit if things get really messy. Most of the UK\u2019s housing surveys have showed a slowdown in price growth recently - although the Halifax has been an outlier. Halifax does have a greater focus on the north of the UK than other lenders, which could partly explain the discrepancy. But it is also reviewing its methodology, after economists questioned its notoriously volatile data. The Bank of England also reported that lending to businesses fell by \u00a34.2bn in July, the biggest decline since August 2017. That\u2019s partly because businesses made a net repayment \u00a32bn to their banks during the month. That could be another sign that firms are resisting investing in new equipment (which often needs a loan), and hunkering down until Brexit is resolved. This is interesting too: Newsflash: The number of mortgages approved in the UK has hit a two-year high. Bank of England data just released show that UK lenders approved 67,306 mortgages in July, up from 66,506 in June. That\u2019s more than expected, and the highest level since mid-2017. Does that contradict the Nationwide\u2019s warning that the UK housing market is subdued, with prices up just 0.6% over the last year? Not necessarily. It may be that sellers have been taking a realistic view on prices, perhaps accepting lower offers to ensure they\u2019ve completed the sale before Brexit, just in case.... The BoE also reported that net mortgage lending rose by \u00a34.611bn in July, the biggest increase since March 2016. Consumer lending increased by \u00a3897m, a rise of 5.5% per year - down from over \u00a31bn in June. The conciliatory noises from Beijing and Washington in recent days has helped push European stock markets higher, in the final session of the week. In London the FTSE 100 is up around 0.35%, or 27 points, at 7210 - its highest level in over a week. Miners are leading the way, up 1.4%, followed by the technology and industrial sectors which have both gained around 1%. Kevin Roberts, director of Legal &amp; General Mortgage Club, says the UK housing market\u2019s biggest problem is there aren\u2019t enough homes. \u201cThere has been a great deal of innovation from mortgage lenders which has helped more first-time buyers to step onto the housing ladder. However, consumers still face challenges when it comes to buying a home. For some it\u2019s the struggle of pulling together a big enough deposit, for others it\u2019s about finding the right type of housing such as later life accommodation. The critical issue is that there are simply not enough homes to meet the demand from consumers, whether people buying their first property or those who want to downsize. In another blow, Lloyds Bank has reported that companies are getting gloomier. Its Business Barometer has fallen to just 1% for August, from 13% in July, its lowest level since December 2011. Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, warns. We have seen a dip in overall business confidence this month, with firms appearing less positive about their own trading prospects and the broader economy Overnight, a closely watched consumer confidence survey has shown that Britons are becoming more anxious. GfK\u2019s consumer confidence index fell to -14 for August, down from -11 in July. That\u2019s the weakest since January. The survey showed a sharp drop in expectations for personal finances and the general economy over the next 12 months. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, warned: \u201cUntil Brexit leaves the front pages \u2013 whenever that will be \u2013 consumers can be forgiven for feeling nervous not just about the wider economy but also about their financial situation. Marc von Grundherr, director of London estate agents Benham and Reeves, is impressed that house prices have risen at all in the last year [by 0.6%]. He hopes that the market will pick up once Brexit has been resolved.... \u201cWhile the UK property market may have ground to a halt on a month on month basis, it is an admirable show of defiance to at least register some annual growth, given the seasonalities at play and the addition of political turbulence that continues to plague home seller sentiment. With Boris lose at the wheel we could well see price growth continue to stall as many brace for what looks like an interesting few months. However, once the dust settles the likelihood is a consistent and strong uplift in property prices, if not this year, then over the next. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, says the UK housing market is becoming more polarised -- with the South suffering the brunt of Brexit uncertainty: \u201cAs the Brexit drama turns up the volume to 11, Britain\u2019s economic and political angst will drown out the rest of the news agenda, leaving the property market to hunker down and ride it out. \u201cBuyers are increasingly splitting into two camps \u2013 with one seeing the current market as a threat, while the other views it as an opportunity. \u201cThe latter look at the current softness of prices as a time of value \u2013 a view which will be cemented if the market settles after Halloween. At the other end of the scale, more cautious buyers are battening down the hatches and waiting until the storm has passed before committing.\u201d These charts, from Nationwide\u2019s house price report, also show how the market has cooled: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. For most of us, a house is the biggest purchase we\u2019ll ever make -- if we get the chance at all. And today we have fresh evidence that Brexit uncertainty is weighing the market down. House prices were flat in August, the Nationwide building society reports this morning, extending a long run of weak growth. On an annual basis, prices were just 0.6% higher than a year ago - lagging behind wages, and the broader inflation measure. The average UK house now costs \u00a3216,096, Nationwide reports, down from \u00a3217,663 (this is not seasonally adjusted, though). It\u2019s rare good news for those trying to get onto the housing ladder, but also a sign that economic confidence remains subdued -- with Britain possibly crashing out of the EU without a deal in two months time. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, explains that that market looks subdued - and affected by \u201cdevelopments in the broader economy\u201d(  Brexit). \u201cAnnual house price growth remained below 1% for the ninth month in a row in August, at 0.6%. While house price growth has remained fairly stable, there have been mixed signals from the property market in recent months. \u201cSurveyors report that new buyer enquiries have increased a little, though key consumer confidence indicators remain subdued. Data on the number of property transactions points to a slowdown in activity, though the number of mortgages approved for house purchase has remained broadly stable. In the near term, healthy labour market conditions and low borrowing costs will provide underlying support, though uncertainty is likely to continue to exert a drag on sentiment and activity. This report comes as UK firms warn that confidence is being damaged by the ongoing Brexit crisis. Yesterday technology firm Micro Focus and recruitment company Hays both warned that investment is being held back and new recruitment plans frozen, as firms fear a disorderly Brexit. Also coming up today August has been a volatile time for the stock market, as fears of a global downturn hit shares. But markets are making a late recovery today, on hopes (once again....) of progress in the US-China trade war. President Donald Trump stoked optimism yesterday, revealing that talks were taking place \u201cat a different level\u201d, adding: \u201cLet\u2019s see what the end product is; that\u2019s what you have to judge it by.\u201d This lifted stocks in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 326 points, or 1.25%. European stock markets are expected to nudge higher today. New eurozone inflation data could move the euro later, as a weak reading would put more pressure on the European Central Bank to ease monetary policy.

The move to set up an alternative parliament follows a similar gathering in Church House last week by MPs who demanded the recall of parliament and said they would oppose prorogation. The meeting, convened by the Labour MP Stephen Doughty and the independent MP Luciana Berger, resulted in a pledge to sit through prorogation signed by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell and the former Conservative MP Anna Soubry as well as Swinson and Lucas.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has joined the effort against microplastics by banning glitter from this year\u2019s Christmas cards, wrapping paper, calendars and crackers. The retailer, which last year tested a biodegradable alternative to glitter on its fresh flowers and plants, said it is aiming to be 100% glitter-free by the end of next year. The move comes amid increasing concern about single-use plastics such as straws and cups as well as microplastics \u2013 tiny particles that can pollute the environment \u2013 as highlighted by programmes such as the BBC\u2019s Blue Planet. Most glitter is made from etched aluminium bonded to polyethylene terephthalate \u2013 a form of microplastic that can find its way into the sea. It is estimated that up to 50tn microplastic particles have accumulated in the ocean, with microplastics present in remote locations including deep sea sediments and arctic sea ice. A petition launched earlier this year by the campaign group 38 Degrees called on the then environment secretary Michael Gove to ban glitter as part of a government crackdown on single-use plastics. It cited a study showing that up to a third of fish caught in the North Sea contained microplastic particles \u2013 including glitter \u2013 raising fears about the impact on sea life and humans. M&amp;S\u2019s action on glitter and plastic comes after Waitrose pledged to ensure own-label cards, wraps, crackers, flowers and plants are either glitter-free or use an environmentally friendly alternative by 2020. Tesco has switched to a plastic-free version for its Christmas range of trees, plants and flowers this year while discount chain Aldi is scrapping plastic glitter from this year\u2019s Halloween range. Craft retailer Hobbycraft has also launched biodegradable glitter alternatives and has pledged that its range will be free of plastic glitter by 2021. The BBC show Strictly Come Dancing banned the use of traditional glitter on the programme last year, while many nursery schools and music festivals in the UK have also axed it. Paul Willgoss, director of food technology at M&amp;S, said: \u201cWe know reducing single-use plastics is as important to our customers as it is to our business.\u201d M&amp;S said all Christmas stationary designs which previously featured glitter were now recyclable and innovative paper patterns or \u201cminimal\u201d use of foil were providing festive sparkle. The retailer\u2019s Christmas gifting range of flowers and plants and single-use packaging for food products, will also be glitter free this year. The majority of its boxed cards have also switched from plastic to card packaging, saving almost 50 tonnes of plastic. M&amp;S said it has already removed 1,000 tonnes of plastic packaging from across its business and aims to ensure all its packaging is widely recyclable by 2022.",

We call the Amazon the \u201clungs of the world\u201d. But let\u2019s not forget that most of the other lungs of the world we have already destroyed.

      "bodyText": "The share of coal in the UK\u2019s electricity system has fallen to record lows in recent months, according to government data. The figures show electricity generated by the UK\u2019s most polluting power plants made up an average of 0.7% of the total in the second quarter of this year. The amount of coal used to power the electricity grid fell by almost two-thirds compared with the same months last year. A government spokesperson said coal-generated energy \u201cwill soon be a distant memory\u201d as the UK moves towards becoming a net zero emissions economy. \u201cThis new record low is a result of our world-leading low-carbon energy industry, which provided more than half of our energy last year and continues to go from strength to strength as we aim to end our contribution to climate change entirely by 2050,\u201d the spokesperson said. The UK electricity market is on track to phase out coal-fired power generation entirely by the government\u2019s target date of 2025. This year three major energy companies have announced plans to close coal-fired power plants in the UK, which would leave only four remaining after the coming winter. RWE said this month it would close the Aberthaw B power station in south Wales, its last UK coal plant, after the winter. SSE will close the Fiddler\u2019s Ferry plant near Warrington, Cheshire, in March 2020, and EDF Energy will shutter the Cottam coal plant in September. So far this year the UK has gone more than 3,000 hours without using coal for power \u2013 nearly five times more than the whole of 2017. Meanwhile, the government\u2019s data shows that renewable energy climbed by 12% from the second quarter of last year, boosted by the startup of the Beatrice windfarm in the Moray Firth in Scotland. The cleaner power system could accelerate carbon savings from the UK\u2019s roads, too, as more drivers opt for electric vehicles. A study by Imperial College London for the energy company Drax found that the UK\u2019s increasingly low-carbon energy system meant electric cars were a greener option even when taking into account the carbon emissions produced by making car batteries.

Yes, though some of them have spent a lifetime telling everyone the Tories are monsters who never stop at anything, it\u2019s almost as if they forgot to tell themselves. For so many opponents of no deal \u2013 from Labour to some Tories to the Lib Dems and beyond \u2013 the politics of moving to make it impossible were painful, so they put it off till the absolute 11th hour.</p> <p>They looked caught on the hop this week. I\u2019m reminded of a Daily Show moment where Jon Stewart wondered at an interviewer asking George W Bush if he believed in spanking. \u201cDoes he believe in spanking? He believes in EXECUTING THE RETARDED. Of course he believes in spanking.\u201d We can\u2019t salute that terminology, but you get the point. Many of these people have spent years telling us that the government cheerily kill its own citizens with austerity. Put like that, it feels unlikely they were going to suddenly draw the taste line at using an executive instrument.</p> <p>Perhaps the general getting-of-shit-together will happen \u201cjust in time\u201d.

Great to have you onboard the train towards a clue, secretary of state! Steve\u2019s fellow passengers include many of the alleged forces against no deal, who seem to have dimly realised the government is both shameless and ruthless. Yes, though some of them have spent a lifetime telling everyone the Tories are monsters who never stop at anything, it\u2019s almost as if they forgot to tell themselves. For so many opponents of no deal \u2013 from Labour to some Tories to the Lib Dems and beyond \u2013 the politics of moving to make it impossible were painful, so they put it off till the absolute 11th hour. They looked caught on the hop this week. I\u2019m reminded of a Daily Show moment where Jon Stewart wondered at an interviewer asking George W Bush if he believed in spanking. \u201cDoes he believe in spanking? He believes in EXECUTING THE RETARDED. Of course he believes in spanking.\u201d We can\u2019t salute that terminology, but you get the point. Many of these people have spent years telling us that the government cheerily kill its own citizens with austerity. Put like that, it feels unlikely they were going to suddenly draw the taste line at using an executive instrument. Perhaps the general getting-of-shit-together will happen \u201cjust in time\u201d. And yet, perhaps it won\u2019t. I hate to adapt a Cummings mug slogan, but maybe all sorts of people should have \u201cGOT READY\u201d rather earlier than they did? \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

Defending his decision to prorogue parliament he said: \u201cThe weird thing is, that the more the parliamentarians try to block the no-deal Brexit, the more likely it is that we\u2019ll end up in that situation.\u201d</li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/30/politics-brexit-mps-lawyers-and-campaigners-battle-prorogation-live-news?page=with:block-5d6909358f082209d3224620#block-5d6909358f082209d3224620\">Johnson also claimed the government had found a way to get Brexit done</a>.

And that\u2019s the point that we are at [in the average of polls]. So I think at the moment an early general election looks like a relatively risky prospect rather than a certainty.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cHe might want to hold an election after he\u2019s delivered Brexit.

Gordon Brown\u2019s claim that the European Union will offer to withdraw 31 October for leaving the bloc, to \u201cpull the rug\u201d from under hardline Brexiteers.</p> \n  <p>Speaking in Edinburgh on Friday morning, Brown said he had been speaking to EU leaders and understood that President Emmanuel Macron of France no longer insisted the UK should be held to that date. Brown claimed Macron had originally insisted on it chiefly to \u201csound tough\u201d during the European election campaign.</p> \n  <p>Speaking at the launch of a new think tank Our Scottish Future, Brown said he accepted EU leaders could not unilaterally withdraw the deadline but were poised to say they would extend it if asked, adding to pressure on Boris Johnson to avoid a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI have actually been talking to some European leaders this week. I believe that next week the European Union will withdraw the October 31st deadline and remove the excuse that Boris Johnson has, and the claim that he\u2019s making, that it\u2019s the European Union being inflexible in their timing, and make it possible for MPs to vote [against] no-deal Brexit.\u201d</p> \n  <p> His remarks were met with incredulity in Brussels, since there has been no discussion of that strategy at all; it was not on the radar. One official there described them as \u201cbizarre\u201d. The EU requires unanimity of all 27 member states on such a change \u2013 a process which involves heads of government involvement, and the UK\u2019s agreement to it.</p> \n  <p>During a question and answer session, Brown went further: \u201cMy information is that Macron no longer holds to that deadline. It was really introduced for his campaign in the European elections to make him sound tough.</p> \n  <p> \u201cAnd none of the other European commissioners, including the new president of the European Commission [Ursula von der Leyen], I believe will hold to that October 31st deadline.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo really the government has two arguments that they want to get across - that it\u2019s a sovereign people against a non-sovereign parliament, and it\u2019s Britain against Europe. Pull the rug from under that argument by saying it\u2019s not Europe that\u2019s being inflexible, it\u2019s up to Britain now, the October 31st deadline can be removed.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d691cd48f08a5e74d6984e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T12:59:57.579Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The writer and leftwing campaigner, Paul Mason, has thanked Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings for galvanising opponents of a no-deal Brexit. </p> \n  <p>In his latest video message he calls for street demonstrations on Saturday against the suspension of Parliament. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulmasonnews/status/1167419932654440448\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In a single week Boris Johnson has created a mass democracy and totally deflated the Hard Brexit brigade's claim to insurgency.

Parliamentarians said to the people \u2018we will respect the result\u2019. And then they triggered article 50 and time and time again they promised that they would deliver on the mandate of the people and they would get Brexit done. And I hope that they will.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Johnson again insisted that Parliament would have time to debate Brexit: \u201cWe are coming up to the last period before we leave on 31 October and in that period, Parliament is going to have a lot to time - they\u2019ve spent three years debating Brexit by the way without actually getting it over the line. They are going to have a lot of time for further consideration.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He suggested the move to prorogue parliament was part of the government\u2019s attempts to show the EU that was serious about leaving with or without a deal on 31 October.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cWhat I want to do now, which is I think what most people in the country want the government to do, is get on and try and get an agreement, but if we can\u2019t get an agreement, get ready to come out anyway. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd it is by getting ready to come out anyway that we have greatly strengthened our position with our friends and partners in the EU, because they see that we are serious. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the more our friends and partners think that Brexit could be stopped, that the UK could be kept in by Parliament, the less likely they are to give us the deal that we need.

That\u2019s the best way forward for our country.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked what he would tell people who have been protesting against the suspension of Parliament, Johnson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My message to them is that the worst thing for democracy now would be to cancel the referendum, which is what some people are now suggesting, to annul that result, to tell the people that they are going to be ignored, after all the promises that have been made. Because everybody can see what the risk is now. </p> \n   <p>\u201cIf we frustrate that mandate, if we stop the UK from leaving on October 31st, if that\u2019s what parliamentarians end up doing, it will do lasting damage to people\u2019s trust in politics. It will do catastrophic damage to the major parties in this country. This political generation won\u2019t be forgiven for failing to honour that promise. </p> \n   <p>\u201cWe told the people we would get it done. We have a way to get it done, we are in the last stages now of negotiating with our friends about a way to get it done. If we can\u2019t succeed in that negotiation we must come out anyway. But the best way to succeed in that negotiation is for everybody to be united in the objective and for the UK negotiations to have the strongest possible hand, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do over the next few weeks. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T21:30:20.712Z\">at 10.30pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d690a688f082209d3224641\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisaocarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T11:37:43.665Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lisaocarroll/status/1167399957776752640\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAK: Lawyer in prorogation case says Belfast court has \"allowed Raymond McCord to file papers to seek an injunction to compel the PM to reverse his advice to prorogue Parliament by close of business on Monday 2 Sept 2019\".

And there are examples over history of that taking place.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked if the House of Lords could block attempts in the Commons to stop a no-deal Brexit, Lisvane said: \u201cI think the Lords would be very cautious about seeking to kill a bill which would actually been passed by the elected house.\u201d</p> \n  <p>And he expressed alarm about a report by <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/boris-johnson-brexit-extreme-measures\">Buzzfeed that the government was considering advising the Queen not to give royal assent </a>to any legislation passed by Parliament delaying Brexit.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cI would hope we get nowhere near that. I think that would be very, very difficult set of circumstances. I think her ministers will be incredibly ill advised to take a step of that sort.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d68d23e8f08a5e74d6981bf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T07:48:22.018Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Letwin confirms talks with Bercow</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Oliver Letwin</strong>, a leading Tory opponent of a no-deal Brexit, has confirmed he been in talks with the speaker, John Bercow on the parliamentary procedures for stopping UK leaving the UK without a deal. </p> \n  <p>He denied that he \u201ccooking up a deal with the speaker\u201d.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping up this live blog for today. Here are the key takeaways from Friday\u2019s politics: Boris Johnson has warned MPs that trying to block a no-deal Brexit makes that outcome more likely. Defending his decision to prorogue parliament he said: \u201cThe weird thing is, that the more the parliamentarians try to block the no-deal Brexit, the more likely it is that we\u2019ll end up in that situation.\u201d Johnson also claimed the government had found a way to get Brexit done. He said: \u201cWe are in the last stages now of negotiating with our friends about a way to get it done. If we can\u2019t succeed in that negotiation we must come out anyway.\u201d A Scottish judge has temporarily rejected calls to block Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament. But Lord Doherty brought forward a full hearing on the case to next Tuesday. A request was also made by the petitioners that Johnson issue a legally binding statement to the court over his reasons for the suspension. If granted the prime minister could potentially be called to face cross-examination. Former prime minister, John Major, Labour deputy leader Tom Watson and Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson have joined Gina Miller\u2019s judicial review against the suspension of parliament. It will be heard in the high court on Thursday 5 September. A lawyer in a separate appeal against prorogation, in the Belfast high court, says a full hearing will take place no later than next Friday. Victims campaigner Raymond McCord, who is making the appeal, has been allowed to file papers in the case, his lawyer said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, is joining the High Court action by Gina Miller, together with John Major and Tom Watson. She said: \u201cThe attempt to shut down Parliament is an anti-democratic, authoritarian power grab by Boris Johnson, who wants to silence the people and their representatives. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats are doing all we can, both in the courts and in Parliament, to prevent both the shutdown of our democracy and a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll be joining the High Court judicial review launched by Gina Miller.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue Parliament hasn\u2019t harmed his election chances a YouGov poll suggests. The poll conducted on Wednesday (the day he announced the move) and Thursday puts the Tories on 33%, 11% above Labour. And the poll puts the LibDems on 21% only 1% behind Labour. But Prof John Curtice, the respected polling expert at Strathclyde University, says calling a general election before Brexit would be risky for Johnson. Speaking to BBC News he said: \u201cThe Conservatives probably need an eight point lead over Labour to have 50% chance of getting an overall majority. And that\u2019s the point that we are at [in the average of polls]. So I think at the moment an early general election looks like a relatively risky prospect rather than a certainty.\u201d He added: \u201cHe might want to hold an election after he\u2019s delivered Brexit. There is some polling evidence to suggest it is not an unreasonable calculation that at that point more of the Brexit party voters would switch to the Conservative Party, and that would open up the kind of lead that might give the Conservatives a secure position inside the House of Commons.\u201d \u201cBut that might mean that Boris Johnson still has to solve that riddle of how to get Brexit through the current House of Commons rather than using a general election to make the task rather easier.\u201d Interviewed before the latest poll was released, Prof Curtice added: \u201cIt is certainly true that across all of the polls, that the leave vote, is gradually proving to be more concentrated than that of the remain vote. \u201cYouGov in particular tend to have the Liberal Democrats relatively higher than most other polls and Labour rather lower, because they are suggesting that if anything, maybe the Liberal Democrats, have slightly more remain voters than Labour. \u201cBut across the piece it looks as though, if you take the average of the polls, that something like 50% or just short or those who voted leave in 2016 currently say they would vote for the Conservatives. Whereas only a quarter of them say they\u2019d vote for the Brexit party. \u201cThe question is whether the squeeze on the Brexit party vote is going to any further.\u201d A hearing at the High Court in London relating to a bid to challenge the suspension of Parliament will take place on Thursday 5 September, a spokesman for the judiciary has confirmed. The spokesman told PA: \u201cA hearing into an application for judicial review received from Gina Miller with the Prime Minister as defendant has been fixed for Thursday 5 September 5 2019 at the Divisional Court in Court 4 at the Royal Courts of Justice, with the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett presiding. \u201cThe court will first consider the request for the case to be heard and, if it agrees, a full hearing will follow the same day. Further information will be given early next week.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far today: Boris Johnson has warned MPs that trying to block a no-deal Brexit makes that outcome more likely. Defending his decision to prorogue parliament he said: \u201cThe weird thing is, that the more the parliamentarians try to block the no-deal Brexit, the more likely it is that we\u2019ll end up in that situation.\u201d Johnson also claimed the government had found a way to get Brexit done. He said: \u201cWe are in the last stages now of negotiating with our friends about a way to get it done. If we can\u2019t succeed in that negotiation we must come out anyway.\u201d A Scottish judge has temporarily rejected calls to block Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament. But Lord Doherty brought forward a full hearing on the case to next Tuesday. A request was also made by the petitioners that Johnson issue a legally binding statement to the court over his reasons for the suspension. If granted the prime minister could potentially be called to face cross-examination. Former prime minister, John Major, and Labour deputy leader Tom Watson have joined Gina Miller\u2019s judicial review against the suspension of parliament. It will be heard in the High Court on Thursday 5 September. A lawyer in a separate appeal against prorogation, in the Belfast High Court, says a full hearing will take place no later than next Friday. The victims campaigner, Raymond McCord, who is making the appeal, has been allowed to file papers in the case, his lawyer said. Gordon Brown has claimed the EU is prepared to withdraw the current 31 October deadline. Speaking in Edinburgh he said: \u201cI believe that next week the European Union will withdraw the October 31st deadline and remove the excuse that Boris Johnson has, and the claim that he\u2019s making, that it\u2019s the European Union being inflexible in their timing.\u201d The idea is being greeted with scepticism in Brussels. Oliver Letwin has confirmed he been in talks with the speaker, John Bercow on the parliamentary procedures for stopping UK leaving the UK without a deal. He insisted there was an opportunity next week in Parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit. Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the House of Commons, has condenmed the prorogation of parliament as a \u201cprofound subversion of the relationship between government and Parliament.\u201d He also defended John Bercow\u2019s outspoken attack against the move. Ken Clarke has said he \u201cprobably would\u201d back Jeremy Corbyn to be caretaker prime minister in order to block a no-deal Brexit. But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, because I must be one of a tiny number of Tories prepared to contemplate that.\u201d Severin Carrell has more on Gordon Brown\u2019s claim that the European Union will offer to withdraw 31 October for leaving the bloc, to \u201cpull the rug\u201d from under hardline Brexiteers. Speaking in Edinburgh on Friday morning, Brown said he had been speaking to EU leaders and understood that President Emmanuel Macron of France no longer insisted the UK should be held to that date. Brown claimed Macron had originally insisted on it chiefly to \u201csound tough\u201d during the European election campaign. Speaking at the launch of a new think tank Our Scottish Future, Brown said he accepted EU leaders could not unilaterally withdraw the deadline but were poised to say they would extend it if asked, adding to pressure on Boris Johnson to avoid a no-deal Brexit. \u201cI have actually been talking to some European leaders this week. I believe that next week the European Union will withdraw the October 31st deadline and remove the excuse that Boris Johnson has, and the claim that he\u2019s making, that it\u2019s the European Union being inflexible in their timing, and make it possible for MPs to vote [against] no-deal Brexit.\u201d His remarks were met with incredulity in Brussels, since there has been no discussion of that strategy at all; it was not on the radar. One official there described them as \u201cbizarre\u201d. The EU requires unanimity of all 27 member states on such a change \u2013 a process which involves heads of government involvement, and the UK\u2019s agreement to it. During a question and answer session, Brown went further: \u201cMy information is that Macron no longer holds to that deadline. It was really introduced for his campaign in the European elections to make him sound tough. \u201cAnd none of the other European commissioners, including the new president of the European Commission [Ursula von der Leyen], I believe will hold to that October 31st deadline. \u201cSo really the government has two arguments that they want to get across - that it\u2019s a sovereign people against a non-sovereign parliament, and it\u2019s Britain against Europe. Pull the rug from under that argument by saying it\u2019s not Europe that\u2019s being inflexible, it\u2019s up to Britain now, the October 31st deadline can be removed.\u201d The writer and leftwing campaigner, Paul Mason, has thanked Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings for galvanising opponents of a no-deal Brexit. In his latest video message he calls for street demonstrations on Saturday against the suspension of Parliament. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, was not informed in advance about the sacking of one of his senior advisers by Boris Johnson\u2019s strategist Dominic Cummings, it has emerged. Sonia Khan, Javid\u2019s media adviser, was escorted from No 10 by a police officer after being accused of misleading Cummings over her contact with individuals close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond, who has been trying to block a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street rebuffed speculation that she had leaked the government\u2019s no-deal planning report, Operation Yellowhammer, to the press. Khan was the second adviser working for Javid to be sacked by No 10, leading to suggestions that Javid is becoming increasingly isolated from the core of the Johnson regime. A suggestion by Gordon Brown that the EU is prepared to withdraw the current 31 October deadline, is being greeted with scepticism in Brussels. Speaking at a seminar in Edinburgh Brown said: \u201cI have actually been talking to some European leaders this week. \u201cI believe that next week the European Union will withdraw the October 31st deadline and remove the excuse that Boris Johnson has and the claim that he\u2019s making that it\u2019s the European Union being inflexible in their timing, and make it possible for MPs to vote [against] no-deal Brexit.\u201d But after putting the idea to EU officials, Mutjaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, says its nonsense. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson says he will also be joining Gina Miller\u2019s legal action against the suspension of Parliament. In a statement he said: \u201cProroguing Parliament is an unprecedented affront to democracy. The rights and freedoms of our citizens have been vandalised. This is an abuse of power that can and should be stopped.\u201d He added: \u201cI have taken advice on legislative solutions to challenge the prime minister\u2019s action to stop us crashing out of the EU without a deal. I am in discussions with colleagues in other parties and a Bill to achieve this outcome has been drafted. \u201cI will be joining the judicial review launched in the High Court by Gina Miller and supported by John Major as a claimant. \u201cI will be represented by Mishcon de Reya, Tom Hickman and David Pannick QC. \u201cI intend to assist the court from the perspective of an active legislator to ensure that there is sufficient time for members of all parties to consider and vote on the Bill.\u201d Interesting thread from the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, on how Johnson\u2019s tactics are going down in Brussels and Berlin. In a separate interview with the BBC, Johnson has warned MPs that trying to block no-deal makes that outcome more likely. He said: \u201cAs long as they think in the EU that parliament might try to block Brexit, the less likely they are to give us the deal we want. So the weird thing is, that the more the parliamentarians try to block the no-deal Brexit, the more likely it is that we\u2019ll end up in that situation.\u201d He added: \u201cSo the best thing now is for use get on and make our points to our European friends with clarity and vigour and that\u2019s what we are doing.\u201d Boris Johnson has defended his decision to prorogue parliament suggesting it has helped the UK negotiating stance with the EU. Asked by Sky News how the decision squared with the promise of leave campaigners to allow Parliament to take back control, he said: \u201cParliament voted to allow the people to have say. Parliamentarians said to the people \u2018we will respect the result\u2019. And then they triggered article 50 and time and time again they promised that they would deliver on the mandate of the people and they would get Brexit done. And I hope that they will.\u201d Johnson again insisted that Parliament would have time to debate Brexit: \u201cWe are coming up to the last period before we leave on 31 October and in that period, Parliament is going to have a lot to time - they\u2019ve spent three years debating Brexit by the way without actually getting it over the line. They are going to have a lot of time for further consideration.\u201d He suggested the move to prorogue parliament was part of the government\u2019s attempts to show the EU that was serious about leaving with or without a deal on 31 October. He said: \u201cWhat I want to do now, which is I think what most people in the country want the government to do, is get on and try and get an agreement, but if we can\u2019t get an agreement, get ready to come out anyway. \u201cAnd it is by getting ready to come out anyway that we have greatly strengthened our position with our friends and partners in the EU, because they see that we are serious. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the more our friends and partners think that Brexit could be stopped, that the UK could be kept in by Parliament, the less likely they are to give us the deal that we need. That\u2019s why I really hope that MPs will allow the UK to do a deal and get ready for a no deal Brexit. That\u2019s the best way forward for our country.\u201d Asked what he would tell people who have been protesting against the suspension of Parliament, Johnson said: My message to them is that the worst thing for democracy now would be to cancel the referendum, which is what some people are now suggesting, to annul that result, to tell the people that they are going to be ignored, after all the promises that have been made. Because everybody can see what the risk is now. \u201cIf we frustrate that mandate, if we stop the UK from leaving on October 31st, if that\u2019s what parliamentarians end up doing, it will do lasting damage to people\u2019s trust in politics. It will do catastrophic damage to the major parties in this country. This political generation won\u2019t be forgiven for failing to honour that promise. \u201cWe told the people we would get it done. We have a way to get it done, we are in the last stages now of negotiating with our friends about a way to get it done. If we can\u2019t succeed in that negotiation we must come out anyway. But the best way to succeed in that negotiation is for everybody to be united in the objective and for the UK negotiations to have the strongest possible hand, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do over the next few weeks. Boris Johnson has given a defiant sounding interview with Sky News. We\u2019ll have more details after it is broadcast. European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva rhas epeated Brussels\u2019 request for Boris Johnson to produce \u201cconcrete proposals\u201d following his call to increase the tempo of talks. She said: \u201cIndeed (the PM\u2019s Europe adviser) David Frost has asked to meet the Commission twice a week to discuss the UK\u2019s withdrawal. \u201cWe have always said from our side that our doors remain open and we have demonstrated, in fact, our willingness to work 24/7 throughout this long process.\u201d She added: \u201cOur position remains that we will need to first see proposals, concrete proposals, from the UK government that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement before we can take these discussions further. \u201cWe have also communicated yesterday that our teams will indeed resume discussions next week.\u201d Gina Miller sets out her objections to the suspension of Parliament here: Here\u2019s a summary of another eventful morning on the Brexit front: A Scottish judge has temporarily rejected calls to block Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament. But Lord Doherty brought forward a full hearing on the case to next Tuesday. A request was also made by the petitioners that Johnson issue a legally binding statement to the court over his reasons for the suspension. If granted the prime minister could potentially be called to face cross-examination. Former prime minister, John Major, has joined Gina Miller\u2019s judicial review against the suspension of parliament. It will be heard in the High Court on Thursday 5 September. An application in Belfast High Court for an injunction against the suspension of Parliament will now not be heard on Friday. Northern Ireland\u2019s Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan told victims campaigner Raymond McCord, who made the legal bid, that if he wanted to pursue the matter a judge would decide on 3 September if the case should be heard later that week. Oliver Letwin has confirmed he been in talks with the speaker, John Bercow on the parliamentary procedures for stopping UK leaving the UK without a deal. He insisted there was an opportunity next week in Parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit. Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the House of Commons, has condenmed the prorogation of parliament as a \u201cprofound subversion of the relationship between government and Parliament.\u201d He also defended John Bercow\u2019s outspoken attack against the move. Ken Clarke has said he \u201cprobably would\u201d back Jeremy Corbyn to be caretaker prime minister in order to block a no-deal Brexit. But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, because I must be one of a tiny number of Tories prepared to contemplate that.\u201d The second legal attempt to injunct the prorogation of parliament appears to be going the same way as the first. PA reports: An application in Belfast High Court for an injunction against the Prime Minister\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament will not be heard on Friday. Northern Ireland\u2019s Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan told victims campaigner Raymond McCord, who made the legal bid, that if he wanted to pursue the matter a judge would decide on 3 September if the case should be heard later that week. McCord is already taking judicial review proceedings to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The hearing on that wider issue is still listed to take place on 16 September. Sir Declan questioned the merits of hearing the case to injunct proroguing until it became clear what Parliament\u2019s response to Boris Johnson\u2019s move might be. \u201cEvery morning you wake up and there\u2019s something new that has occurred here,\u201d he said during Friday\u2019s short hearing in Belfast High Court. A Scottish government said it has noted the court\u2019s decision. He said: \u201cWe will continue to monitor this case, and to press for Scotland and the UK to remain in the European Union. \u201cThe Scottish Government will be bringing a debate to the Scottish Parliament next week calling for a no deal Brexit to be ruled out under all circumstances.\u201d The cabinet secretary for constitutional relations, Michael Russell, said: \u201cI pay tribute to the MPs and Peers, led by parliamentarians from Scotland, who brought this action to assert their right to hold the UK Government to account. \u201cThe impact of leaving the EU, and particularly leaving without a deal, will be grave, profound and damaging. \u201cAttempting to deprive the Westminster Parliament of the opportunity to scrutinise the UK government\u2019s plans, and preventing it from being able to legislate in respect of the UK government\u2019s plans, is undemocratic and unconstitutional. \u201cAll MPs and all citizens, regardless of their position on leaving the EU, should be alarmed by the prime minister\u2019s plan to avoid debate and prevent the legislative action necessary to avert a catastrophic no deal exit.\u201d Litigation partner at Pinsent Masons, Jim Cormack QC, said the Court of Session\u2019s decision to refuse an interim interdict on the basis that a full hearing can be brought forward is quite common. He added: \u201cGiven the nature and potential effects of the orders the court is being asked to grant, it is understandable why the court prefers to bring forward a full hearing in this case. \u201cThe petitioners may take some comfort from the fact that in refusing interim orders, the judge has focused on the practicalities rather than delving too far at this stage into the substantive strengths and weaknesses of the arguments. That is now a matter which will come before the court on Tuesday.\u201d The government has welcomed the Court of Session\u2019s decision to refuse an emergency order to block prorogation. A government spokeswoman said: \u201cAs we have set out, the government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda, and MPs are not prevented from scrutinising our withdrawal from the EU. \u201cWe are glad the court found against the interdict - there was no good reason to seek one, given the full hearing is due to take place next week, and the process of bringing the session to an end will not start until the week commencing 9 September.\u201d The Labour MP, Ian Murray, who is also backing the legal action in Scotland, said: \u201cThis verdict means a full hearing has been fast-tracked to next week, which is now the most important week in modern British history. \u201cIt is disappointing that we have to go to the courts to protect British democracy, but Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to silence the people\u2019s representatives cannot go unchallenged. \u201cAs well as this legal battle in the Court of Session, the campaign against a no-deal Brexit will also take place in the House of Commons. \u201cWe must work tirelessly, across all parties and none, to fight against the devastation of a no-deal Brexit, fight for our democracy, and fight for the people to have a final say on Brexit.\u201d Joanna Cherry, the SNP\u2019s justice and home affairs spokeswoman and one of those who brought the case against prorogation, said the decision to bring forward the full hearing to next Tuesday was a vindication of the action. Speaking outside Edinburgh\u2019s Court of Session, she confirmed the judge had refused to grant an emergency order against prorogation. She said: \u201cBut he hasn\u2019t made any ruling on the merits of our arguments that prorogation should be stopped. He wants to hear further and full argument on Tuesday morning hear the Court of Session before making a decision. I see that as a victory for us. \u201cAidan O\u2019Neill, QC, who is instructed by myself and my fellow petitioners, pointed out to the court that the court ordered that affidavits should be lodged at an earlier stage. \u201cThe prime minster should lodge a sworn affidavit setting out his reasons for the prorogation and make himself available for cross examination before the court if necessary. \u201cThis is an interesting suggestion, particularly in the light of the comments that were caught off camera from the defence minister [Ben Wallace] indicating that the reason for the prorogation was, as I and others have always argued to frustrate the democratic ability of parliament to stop a no-deal where we all know there is a majority against no deal. \u201cSo I see this as a vindication of our decision to take this action.\u201d You can read Wallace\u2019s comments here. More on the Scottish challenge: Aiden O\u2019Neill QC, representing those for the action, argued for the substantive hearing to be moved forward. He said: \u201cThere is an urgency to this - any delay is prejudicial - not just to the prejudice of the petitioners, but to the country as a whole.\u201d The hearing was then changed from Friday September 6 to Tuesday in the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d. Lord Doherty said: \u201cI\u2019m going to move the substantive hearing forward to Tuesday. \u201cWeighing consideration in the balance, it\u2019s in the interest of justice that it proceeds sooner rather than later.\u201d It\u2019s going to be busy week in the courts. A separate challenge to the suspension of Parliament by Gina Miller and John Major\u2019s will be heard next Thursday, Miller says. Lord Doherty has brought forward the full hearing on the legality of prorogation from Friday next week to Tuesday. It will held at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. Judge Lord Doherty said: \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied that it has been demonstrated that there\u2019s a need for an interim suspension or an interim interdict to be granted at this stage. \u201cA substantive hearing is set to place for Friday September 6, before the first possible date parliament could be prorogued.\u201d Judge Lord Doherty dismissed the action ahead of a full hearing originally set for 6 September. Aidan O\u2019Neill the barrister for those making the challenge demanded Johnson explained on oath why he needed to prorogue parliament. Opponents of Boris Johnson\u2019s bid to suspend parliament have been denied an interim interdict at the court of session in Edinburgh. Some initial reaction to John Major\u2019s legal intervention: On Wednesday Major warned that said he was seeking legal advice on whether he can challenge Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. In a statement read out on BBC News, Major said: \u201cI have no doubt that the prime minister\u2019s motive in seeking prorogation is to bypass a sovereign parliament that opposes his policy. As events unfold I will continue to seek advice on the legality of this and other matters, but will be making no further comment.\u201d Last month Major said he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop Johnson proroguing parliament. In June he said this: In his statement Major said: I promised that, if the prime minister prorogued Parliament in order to prevent members from opposing Brexit plans, I would seek judicial review of his action. In view of the imminence of the prorogation \u2013 and to avoid duplication of effort, and taking up the Court\u2019s time through repetition \u2013 I intend to seek the court\u2019s permission to intervene in the claim already initiated by Gina Miller, rather then to commence separate proceedings. If granted permission to intervene, I intend to seek to assist the Court from the perspective of having served in government as a minister and prime minister. John Major says he will seek to join Gina Miller in her court bid to block the suspension of parliament. In a statement to lobby journalists he said he will be represented in court by Edward Garnier, a former minister and barrister. Shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti said she believed opponents of Boris Johnson had the numbers in Parliament to force through a change in the law to block a no-deal Brexit, PA reports. She suggested people should \u201ctake to the streets\u201d if the government continues its approach. \u201cMy own soundings and those of colleagues in discussions over the last couple of days, in particular since the constitutional outrage, give me greater comfort that minds are now focused, especially on the Conservative side,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today. She said she believed the measure could also get through the Lords: \u201cI know that all sorts of high jinks have been discussed, filibusters and so on, but I believe that there are means of preventing any sort of public school dirty tricks working, even in the House of Lords.\u201d In response to suggestions the government could seek to delay royal assent to any legislation to block no-deal, Chakrabarti said: \u201cWe do know that we are dealing with a bunch of people who have no respect for our precious constitution. \u201cIf they try any more of this stuff we will use any means necessary to prevent this undemocratic behaviour - that includes people taking to the streets, that includes people taking to the airwaves, that includes people going to court. \u201cBecause they are behaving in a way that is unworthy of a UK government.\u201d Update on the three legal challenges: A decision is expected some time after 10am by a judge hearing the case at the Court of Session in Edinburgh brought by a cross-party group of 70 MPs and peers seeking to stop the Prime Minister from suspending Parliament. From 10.30am at the High Court in Belfast, victims campaigner Raymond McCord, will try to secure an injunction preventing prorogation. A third legal challenge brought by campaigner Gina Miller at the High Court in London \u201cis being considered\u201d, according to a judiciary spokeswoman. Ken Clarke has said he \u201cprobably would\u201d back Jeremy Corbyn to be caretaker prime minister in order to block a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News, the former chancellor and father of the House, said: \u201cSo long as it were absolutely certain we could keep Jeremy under control and he wouldn\u2019t have the slightest chance of implementing any bits of his Labour manifesto, I hate to tell you but I probably would.\u201d But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, because I must be one of a tiny number of Tories prepared to contemplate that.\u201d Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the House of Commons, has joined those criticising the prorogation of Parliament and defended John Bercow\u2019s outspoken attack against the move. He told Today: \u201cI think if you prevent Parliament from taking a decision or expressing a view because you think it won\u2019t be to your taste, that\u2019s a pretty profound subversion of the relationship between government and Parliament.\u201d \u201cI think it would be bad for the government\u2019s reputation in the long term as well as the short term. I think there\u2019s an element of fair play involved. If for some people, that doesn\u2019t matter, then I think the effects will be far reaching.\u201d After Bercow described the move as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d, the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said such remarks were unconstitutional. Lisvane said Rees-Mogg was \u201cwrong\u201d. He said: \u201cThe house\u2019s presiding officer is also the representative of its interests. And if he sees those interests being damaged or threatened, I think it\u2019s reasonable for him to say something about it. And there are examples over history of that taking place.\u201d Asked if the House of Lords could block attempts in the Commons to stop a no-deal Brexit, Lisvane said: \u201cI think the Lords would be very cautious about seeking to kill a bill which would actually been passed by the elected house.\u201d And he expressed alarm about a report by Buzzfeed that the government was considering advising the Queen not to give royal assent to any legislation passed by Parliament delaying Brexit. He said: \u201cI would hope we get nowhere near that. I think that would be very, very difficult set of circumstances. I think her ministers will be incredibly ill advised to take a step of that sort.\u201d Oliver Letwin, a leading Tory opponent of a no-deal Brexit, has confirmed he been in talks with the speaker, John Bercow on the parliamentary procedures for stopping UK leaving the UK without a deal. He denied that he \u201ccooking up a deal with the speaker\u201d. But asked about a report in the Telegraph he had talked to Bercow while the speaker was on holiday in Turkey, Letwin said: \u201cIt is perfectly true that for many months I\u2019ve been talking both to the clarks and the speaker and that\u2019s the appropriate thing to do if they want to establish what the procedures are, and we\u2019ll go on doing that. Letwin also insisted there was an opportunity next week in Parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said: \u201cI\u2019m concerned about how we can ensure that Britain doesn\u2019t make a sudden, disorderly, undemocratic, no-deal exit on 31 October. I believe that there probably is time. Whether we can get the required majorities in the House of Commons is altogether another matter. \u201cI know there are a number of my colleagues who feel that a disorderly, no-deal exit is a very bad idea and they have in the past been willing to support efforts to prevent that happening. \u201cI hope that Parliament will take a series of actions that by the end of the week mean that Boris Johnson knows that as prime minister that if doesn\u2019t get a deal he is going to have seek an extension.\u201d He said he disagreed with former cabinet minister David Lidington, who suggested on Thursday that the time for Parliament to act was after the October EU summit. Letwin said: \u201cI hope that we can take action this coming week so that if the prime minister hasn\u2019t got a deal in place then he needs to seek an extension.\u201d Ireland\u2019s deputy premier Simon Coveney insisted that any Brexit deal with the UK must be based on the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May. He said: \u201cWe want to get a deal that manages a sensible Brexit, that moves us into a transition period that gives us time and space to work out a future relationship. \u201cBut that deal has to be based on the Withdrawal Agreement and it has to be consistent with that, and if the UK wants to remove an element of the Withdrawal Agreement they have to acknowledge that that causes problems and they have to propose alternatives that can solve those problems, certainly in the case of the backstop.\u201d \u201cWe have always said if there are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, then let\u2019s hear them, and if we can work out a deal on that basis so be it. \u201cBut what we will not do in Ireland - and I believe there is strong solidarity across the EU on this - we will not allow a really important element of the Withdrawal Agreement to be removed - i.e. the backstop, which solves a difficult problem, albeit on a temporary basis - and for that to be replaced with something that doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny and is simply a promise that we\u2019ll do our best to solve the problem, but not explain how. \u201cThat is not an approach that either Ireland or the EU will support.\u201d On Boris Johnson\u2019s suggestion of negotiations for two days a week, Coveney said: \u201cI\u2019m sure if he wanted five days of negotiations a week, the EU would be OK with that. \u201cMichel Barnier is there as the chief negotiator for that purpose, he has a team that\u2019s ready to go. \u201cWe all want to get a deal.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any problem from a European Union perspective in terms of making time available for negotiations.\u201d \u201cWe all want to try to resolve these issues, we want to find a way of getting a deal that the UK are happy with and that the EU is happy with and can accept too. There is no country that wants a deal more than Ireland.\u201d The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has been sent out to the broadcast media to defend the suspension of parliament. He repeated the government\u2019s claim that there is nothing unusual or improper in what the government is doing. Speaking to Sky News: \u201cTo allow four days in October so that the Queen can come and open Parliament again is perfectly normal, constitutional and is the right thing to do.\u201d He also claimed there was \u201cnothing new\u201d to discuss on Brexit. He said: \u201cThis idea that Parliament won\u2019t get the chance to debate Brexit again is completely untrue. And it not like this hasn\u2019t been discussed. In fact there is nothing new to discuss on the Brexit front until we get to that October European summit.\u201d He added: \u201cWe must leave in order to ensure that people have faith in democracy\u201d. Earlier speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: \u201cThe next big thing to happen will be around the next European summit and that\u2019s not until the middle of October anyway and that is the time at which there may be something new to discuss.\u201d Shapps also announced \u00a330m for minor ports to help them prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Dominic Raab, the only contender in the Tory leadership race to back proroguing parliament in the campaign, has dismissed the furore over move as \u201cnonsense\u201d. The foreign secretary insisted only around four days of Commons sitting time would be lost by suspending parliament for up to five weeks before a Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October \u2013 a calculation based on MPs leaving Westminster for the party conferences. He told reporters at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Helsinki: \u201cThe idea this is some kind of constitutional outrage is nonsense. It\u2019s actually lawful, it\u2019s perfectly proper, there is precedent for it and actually, fundamentally, for the people watching this, they want to see that we are leaving the EU but also talking about all the other things they expect us to be addressing.\u201d Welcome to a Friday edition of Politics Live. Boris Johnson says he was wants to step up the tempo of talks on a Brexit deal as a judge prepares to rule on a legal challenge aimed at stopping him suspending parliament. Downing Street said the UK\u2019s team of Brexit negotiators will sit down with their EU counterparts twice a week during September \u201cwith the possibility of additional technical meetings, to discuss a way forward on securing a new deal\u201d. It is being seen as an attempt to calm the concerns of rebel Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit, some of whom are threatening to join opposition efforts to tie the PM\u2019s hands by legislating against the UK leaving the EU with an agreement. Meanwhile, a judge in Scotland will rule on Friday on a legal bid to block Johnson\u2019s move to prorogue parliament for over a month during the Brexit countdown. A court in Northern Ireland will also hear from lawyers representing anti-no-deal campaigners challenging the move and attempt to do the same at the high court in London is also under way. Judge Lord Doherty heard arguments from a lawyer for the campaigners and a legal representative for the UK government at a hearing at the court of session in Edinburgh on Thursday and he is due at the same court on Friday morning to make a decision on the case. Northern Ireland\u2019s Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, who sat for the short hearing at Belfast high court on Thursday, will hold a substantive hearing on Friday morning. A third legal challenge brought by campaigner Gina Miller at the high court in London \u201cis being considered\u201d, according to a judiciary spokeswoman.",

      "bodyText": "A parliamentary group has thrown its support behind a Scottish businessman who launched a second hunger strike outside Clydesdale Bank\u2019s group headquarters this week, saying the lender failed to properly investigate his case. The all-party parliamentary group on fair business banking has urged the bank\u2019s owner, CYBG, to reconsider its position. The bank has said it was not responsible for the collapse of John Guidi\u2019s \u00a316m property business and will not intervene to prevent the possible seizure of his home. The parliamentary group\u2019s Tory vice-chair, Stephen Kerr, said Clydesdale needed to thoroughly examine the events that had led to Guidi\u2019s situation and properly investigate \u201cthe bank\u2019s culpability at all the points along the way\u201d. In a letter to the CYBG chief executive, David Duffy, Kerr said: \u201cI am alarmed to hear that Mr Guidi has restarted his hunger strike this week. We had hoped to see CYBG engage in a meaningful, proactive and productive discussion. However, all evidence thus far is that it is burying its head in the sand.\u201d Guidi, who repitched his tent outside the CYBG headquarters in Glasgow on Monday, claims he is at risk of becoming homeless after his business collapsed. He alleges he was mis-sold tailored business loans in the early 2000s and Clydesdale abruptly withdrew funding in 2012, transferring the loans to CYBG\u2019s former owner National Australia Bank. Those loans were then sold to a private equity firm, Cerberus, which Guidi says aggressively pursued his debts. Having signed a personal guarantee on the loans, Guidi says he is at risk of losing his home. Guidi protested in front of CYBG\u2019s headquarters in March but suspended his strike after four days when Duffy agreed to look into his case. CYBG, which owns the banking brands Clydesdale, Yorkshire and Virgin Money, held five meetings with Guidi in the months that followed. The bank is understood to have approached Cerberus about his case before concluding it was \u201cnot responsible\u201d for Guidi\u2019s situation. Kerr said CYBG had failed to address key claims in Guidi\u2019s case. These included allegations that CYBG introduced terms on Guidi\u2019s loans in 2011 that put him in immediate breach of his contract and set off a series of events that led to his firm\u2019s bankruptcy. Kerr also criticised the lender for dodging questions over the sale of the loans and whether it had properly assessed the impact of the deal on vulnerable customers. \u201cI do hope that the bank will reconsider its position,\u201d Kerr said. A CYBG spokesman said: \u201cMr Kerr\u2019s letter is deeply disappointing, making a number of inaccurate and unfounded accusations against the bank. Contrary to Mr Kerr\u2019s allegation, we have engaged extensively with Mr Guidi and have reviewed his case in detail. While we are not responsible for the position he is in, we have pursued a number of avenues to see if we can help Mr Guidi resolve his situation.\u201d The spokesman said CYBG had answered a number of questions about Guidi\u2019s case during a meeting with Kerr this year and had \u201cengaged constructively\u201d with the parliamentary committee. \u201cWe remain confident that our reviews of past business loans have been conducted in a rigorous manner and delivered fair outcomes to customers.\u201d Court hearing looms for hunger striker On Friday, Guidi said sheriffs approached him at his tent in Glasgow to serve court papers that will restart a legal battle over his home. The hunger striker filed a case against Cerberus earlier this year to try to block the private equity firm from seizing his home. But Cerberus asked Guidi to prove he could cover \u00a375,000 of their legal costs before going ahead with the case, one of Guidi\u2019s advisers said.

In his first House of Commons speech Boris Johnson emphasised that applicants could expect \u201cabsolute certainty for the right to live and remain\u201d and said: \u201cI repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 million EU nationals now living and working among us.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy.

However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But since the scheme began the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/825277/eu-settlement-scheme-statistics-july-2019.pdf\">proportion</a> of people being granted pre-settled status rather than settled status \u2013 and therefore finding themselves in a more precarious position, without the guaranteed permanent right to remain \u2013 has risen from 32% during the testing phase up to 34% in the month after the national launch in March, and to 42% in July.</p> \n<p>The cause of the jump is unclear.

In his first House of Commons speech Boris Johnson emphasised that applicants could expect \u201cabsolute certainty for the right to live and remain\u201d and said: \u201cI repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 million EU nationals now living and working among us.\u201d But since the scheme began the proportion of people being granted pre-settled status rather than settled status \u2013 and therefore finding themselves in a more precarious position, without the guaranteed permanent right to remain \u2013 has risen from 32% during the testing phase up to 34% in the month after the national launch in March, and to 42% in July.

      "bodyText": "What this solemn and enlivening documentary plunge into the history of Ridley Scott\u2019s sci-fi classic reiterates is the idea of film as a collective art form \u2013 not just the wider circle of writers, performers and technicians beyond the director, but in the case of the truly great films, serendipitous access to a deeper collective unconscious to which we all have the keys \u2013 even if few know how to use them. In addition to the visually hyper-literate Scott and concept designer HR Giger, whose \u201cmystic\u201d intuition gave us the phallus-mawed xenomorph, the unsung hero of Alien is its screenwriter Dan O\u2019Bannon.

Women not only have to do the same exact job in every area of hospitality but also have had to contend with every oppressive jibe in the book from day one and not only from their colleagues but from industry leaders like this in 2019 ffs \ud83d\ude44. Frankly I don\u2019t think men could handle this bullshit every day. I think they\u2019d crumble under the pressure. The whole article if you read it actually comes up the conclusion that women are better in the kitchen but unfortunately via all this clickbait nonsense from a rambling dinosaur . How about we just start judging people based on their individual performance and start promoting the much needed diversity within this dying industry that so desperately needs it.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/frontlinechef/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Neil Rankin</a> (@frontlinechef) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-08-29T07:50:18+00:00\">Aug 29, 2019 at 12:50am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Byron Burger\u2019s director of food and drink, Sophie Michell, said she was \u201cfucking sick of this shit and it is prevalent FYI, across the board\u201d.</p> <p>Some pointed out that White himself had shown his fair share of emotions while on television. A former kitchen worker, James Ritchie, from Sunderland, said the comments contradicted his own experiences.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe few women I worked with were in complete control of their emotions and handled pressure and casual sexism with aplomb, whereas many male colleagues regularly had tantrums, lost control, and were abusive to other members of staff because of the pressures of working in a high-end kitchen.

      "bodyText": "The former Michelin star chef Marco Pierre White has come under fire for suggesting women cannot handle the heat of working in kitchens. White, 57, suggested women were too emotional and not strong enough to carry heavy pans. In an interview with the Irish Independent, the TV presenter and restaurateur said: \u201cThe real positive with men is that men can absorb pressure better, that\u2019s the main difference, because they are not as emotional and they don\u2019t take things personally. \u201cLook at the size of some of the pans you are carrying. Can you imagine you\u2019re a lady in the kitchen and saying: \u2018Will you carry that pan for me?\u2019\u201d The comments have prompted a backlash from industry professionals. Asma Khan, the founder of the London Indian restaurant Darjeeling Express \u2013 which is staffed by an all-female kitchen team \u2013 said she was disappointed by the comments. \u201cLike a three-day-old fish, [these comments] reek of patriarchy, and there is no place in the kitchen for rotting fish or chefs with these attitudes,\u201d she told Big Hospitality. The lack of women working in kitchens is an issue that has previously been called into question. According to the latest available figures from the Office for National Statistics, only 17% of chef positions in the UK are held by women. Neil Rankin, the owner of the Temper steakhouse and barbecue restaurants in London, called White a \u201crambling dinosaur\u201d. In an Instagram post, he added: \u201cThe only real difference between men and women in the kitchen is that men don\u2019t have to put up with this nauseating baseless antiquated bullshit everyday.\u201d Byron Burger\u2019s director of food and drink, Sophie Michell, said she was \u201cfucking sick of this shit and it is prevalent FYI, across the board\u201d. Some pointed out that White himself had shown his fair share of emotions while on television. A former kitchen worker, James Ritchie, from Sunderland, said the comments contradicted his own experiences. He said: \u201cThe few women I worked with were in complete control of their emotions and handled pressure and casual sexism with aplomb, whereas many male colleagues regularly had tantrums, lost control, and were abusive to other members of staff because of the pressures of working in a high-end kitchen. Not unlike a certain Marco Pierre White back in his heyday.\u201d White is no stranger to controversy. Last week, he hit the headlines after calling Jamie Oliver \u201cdelusional\u201d for blaming the collapse of his restaurant chain on Brexit uncertainty. In 2017, he was criticised after an appearance on Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Critiquing a salmon dish cooked by a female contestant and her sister, White said: \u201cAnd you hope to keep a husband.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for the day from me. There will be further news to follow on the Europa League, Arsenal v Spurs and hopefully some better news on Bury on the site. Thanks for reading. Fourth plays eleventh, positions both would settle for at the end of the season. Poch dismissed out of hand those rumours about an imminent departure. Denis Irwin, Manchester United ambassador and legendary full-back, has been speaking like an ambassador about United\u2019s Europa League draw of FC Astana, Partizan Belgrade and AZ Alkmaar. It\u2019s an interesting draw - we\u2019ve not played Astana before and it\u2019s a long way away. So, logistically speaking, it\u2019s not the easiest but we\u2019ll have to take it on board. Belgrade is always a great place to play football and Alkmaar is only a short hop. But we\u2019re in this competition to win it. People might think we\u2019re in it for the sake of it but we\u2019re in it to win it. We won it a couple of years ago and we\u2019re looking forward to it. We\u2019ve got a big squad and I\u2019m sure the manager will utilise that. We would rather be in the Champions League, obviously, but we\u2019ll be out to win this competition. More on Ritchieanklegate: Manager Brendan Rodgers has defended Choudhury after Newcastle boss Steve Bruce criticised his tackle on Matt Ritchie. I spoke to Steve after the game. It\u2019s one of those challenges, it\u2019s very committed. He\u2019s a real genuine, honest boy, Hamza, so he certainly wasn\u2019t looking to injure anybody. It was a strong challenge, he went in with the intent to win the ball, which was clear, and then maybe just on the follow through has just slightly injured Ritchie. Big Zlat\u2019s third coming is unlikely. The BBC reports that legal action has been launched by members of the club executive against the EFL for expelling the club. The club have since sent a letter to the EFL setting out a list of questions - seen by BBC Sport - including: Why a late bid from Brazilian multi-millionaire pastor Gustavo Benedito, which emerged on Tuesday afternoon, was not accepted. Why the EFL said that a bid from an Italian consortium had not been received when the club insist that it had. Why the offer from C&amp;N Sporting Risk was the only one accepted by the EFL and the only one granted an extension. Why is it proportionate to consider dropping Bury five leagues - the club want the EFL to consider dropping them down to League Two instead Why owner Steve Dale passed the fit and proper person test. Why the EFL refused to meet with representatives of Bury on Friday. Why ex-Port Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite was not considered to be an appropriate owner. Peter Oh continues the wolverine theme, invoking Romulus and Remus themselves: \u201cArguably, there\u2019s a fourth lupine club in the Europa League: Roma. Their crest prominently features a wolf - and they\u2019re in the same group as Wolfsberger! That should be a howlin\u2019 good pair of fixtures.\u201d The Danny Wallace derby. Kyle Walker-Peters didn\u2019t get a call either. Rob Geddes on that wolverine near-miss in the Europa League draw. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a shame the three lupine teams weren\u2019t drawn together - but we can all hope for a Wolfsburg/Wolves Round of 32 match (no offence Wolfsberger). Of course, the best thing would have been if Wolfgang Wolf were manager of a Pot 2 team, and had been drawn against the three Wolves - but according to Wikipedia he\u2019s no longer an active coach :( \u201c Jordan Ayew takes on his old club... Pep Guardiola began his press conference today by sending his personal condolences and those of Manchester City to former Barcelona coach, and his former Bar\u00e7a teammate, Luis Enrique following the death of his nine-year-old daughter Xana, who had been battling bone cancer. \u201cWe knew it was not good, but always you dream everything is going well,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI don\u2019t have words, there is absolutely nothing to say. Always you try to find reasons why, but there is no argument for a little girl, only nine years old. From Manchester City and my family, we are here, and hopefully soon I can see him and tell him how I love him and his family.\u201d Nicklas Bendtner nostalgia corner. The Fatty Foulke derby takes place on Saturday. A revenge mission for Celtic in the Europa League. They will face Cluj, who knocked them out of Champions League qualifying. Their manager, Neil Lennon, has been talking. \u201cIt\u2019s a great draw,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of glamour games there and obviously a chance to maybe exact some sort of retribution to Cluj as well. \u201cRennes are a good side, they won the cup last season, which is no mean feat beating PSG in the final. They have some very talented, quick players. And of course Lazio is a great draw, very glamorous and a trip to Rome as well. That\u2019s something everyone here will look forward to.\u201d Good news for fans. Sense at last, though horse bolted some years ago. The Arsenal midfielder Mohamed Elneny will travel to Istanbul where he is expected to undergo a medical before completing a one-year loan move to Besiktas. Arsenal have given Elneny the green light to make the move and all that remains before the transfer goes ahead is for the final details over payment of bonuses to be agreed. Besiktas sporting director Ali Naibi said \u201cWe have reached an agreement with Arsenal over Mohamed Elneny. He will undergo his medical next, if he passes we will add him to our squad on a loan transfer.\u201d Besiktas have been in talks with Elneny over the past week as a replacement for Gary Medel who is set to complete his move to Serie A side Bologna. There will be more to follow from Mauricio Pochettino later but he has quashed the rumours he would be quitting Tottenham this weekend. Per PA Media Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino insists he will not walk away from the club after Sunday\u2019s game. Rumours began to spread on social media that the Argentinian will quit, leading to some bookmakers no longer taking bets on him becoming the next Premier League manager to leave his job. But Pochettino has labelled the speculation \u201cstupid\u201d. He said: \u201cThat stupidity can happen through some rumour sending to social media that creates a big, big problem that doesn\u2019t exist. \u201cI am not going to walk away after the north London derby. I will be here on Monday and Tuesday.\u201d N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 has been ruled out of Chelsea\u2019s game against Sheffield United on Saturday and France\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Albania and Andorra next month as the Premier League club seek to ensure he makes a full recovery from a persistent ankle injury. Frank Lampard has spoken with the French national manager, Didier Deschamps, to explain the situation and Kant\u00e9 will be permitted to rest over the international break in the hope he will be ready to return for the Premier League match at Wolves in mid-September. The 28-year-old, whose pre-season was wrecked as he recovered from a knee injury, had complained of discomfort in his ankle in the aftermath of the draw against his former club, Leicester City, and missed last weekend\u2019s win at Norwich. \u201c(His absence) is a setback, of course,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cBut my focus is now on making sure he\u2019s okay. He\u2019s had four years of constant football at an incredibly high energy and output level. We have to get that right. I had a conversation with Didier Deschamps and we both agreed it\u2019s the best thing for him. Let\u2019s try and get him fit over the break.\u201d Chelsea will also be without Pedro against Sheffield United, while Antonio Rudiger will continue working on his own match fitness by playing for the under-23s against Tottenham Hotspur this evening. \u201cThat will be his last under-23s game in terms of gaining proper match fitness,\u201d added Lampard. \u201cThe hope is he\u2019ll then be in contention after the international break.\u201d Thanks to those who pointed out the difference between Wolfsburg, Wolfsberger and, yes, Wolves. Robert Plant only supports one of those teams. Quiz! Quiz! Quiz! Read our story on today\u2019s Europa League draw: And some more Premier League previews. And Jacob Steinberg on Javi Gracia\u2019s turmoil at Watford. Reaction will flow in to that draw presently, meanwhile here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack\u2019s tribute to Lucy Bronze. Group A Sevilla Apoel Qarabag Dudelange Group B Dynamo Kiev Copenhagen Malmo Lugano Group C FC Basel Krasnodar Getafe Trabzonspor Group D Sporting CP PSV Rosenborg LASK Group E Lazio Celtic Rennes CFR Cluj Group F Arsenal Eintracht Frankfurt Standard Liege Vitoria FC Group G Porto Young Boys Feyenoord Rangers Group H CSKA Moscow Ludogorets Espanyol Ferencvaros Group I Wolfsburg Gent St Etienne Olexandriya Group J Roma Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach Istanbul Basaksehir Wolfsberger Group K Besiktas Braga Wolves Slovan Bratislava Group L Manchester United Astana Partizan Belgrade AZ Alkmaar And here\u2019s a cut-out-and-keep guide to the Europa League group stage. Those Brits clubs know their fate: (Arsenal\u2019s social media team presumably on holiday, though they got a decent enough draw.) Group J is missing amid all that confusion: Roma, Monchengladbach, Istanbul Basaksehir and Wolfsberger. Group L: AZ Alkmaar join Manchester United, Astana and Partizan. Group K: Slovan Bratislava, Beskitas, Braga and Wolves Group G: Ferenvaros, CSKA, Ludogorets and ...

Group G: Rangers, Porto, Young Boys and Feyenoord Group C: Trabzanspor, Basel, Krasnodar and Getafe. Group B: Lugano, Kiev, Malmo, Copenhagen. Group A: Dudelange, join Sevilla, Apoel and Qarabag Pot 4: They are ploughing on here, having said there was a \u201cdisconnect\u201d with the previous lot. Group K: Partizan join Manchester United and...or do they? Seems to be confusion. Group F: Standard Liege join Arsenal and Eintracht Group J: Istanbul Basaksehir join Roma and Borussia Monchengladbach. Group I: Saint Etienne join Wolfsburg and Gent. Group H: Espanyol join CSKA and Ludogorets Group E: Rennes join Lazio and Celtic. Group D: Rosenborg join Sporting Lisbon and PSV Group G: Feyenoord join FC Porto and Young Boys Group C: Getafe join Basel and Krasnodar.

Group B: Dynamo Kiev. Group A: Sevilla, who have won this trophy five times. Off the balls go, as the first pot is spun.... Small, significant note: teams from Russia and Ukraine will not be drawn in the same group together. A reminder of the pots. Pot 1: Sevilla, Arsenal, FC Porto, AS Roma, Manchester United, Dynamo Kiev, Besiktas, FC Basel, Sporting Lisbon, CSKA Moscow, VfL Wolfsburg, Lazio Pot 2: PSV Eindhoven, FK Krasnodar, Celtic, FC Copenhagen, Sporting Braga, Gent, Borussia Monchengladbach, FK Astana, Young Boys, Ludogorets Razgrad, APOEL Nicosia, Eintracht Frankfurt Pot 3: Saint Etienne, Qarabag, Feyenoord, Getafe, Espanyol, Malmo, Partizan Belgrade, Standard Liege, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Stade Rennes, Rosenborg, Istanbul Basaksehir Pot 4: AZ Alkmaar, Vitoria Guimaraes, Trabzonspor, FC Oleksandriya, F91 Dudelange, LASK Linz, Wolfsberger, FC Lugano, Slovan Bratislava, Rangers, CFR Cluj, Ferencvaros The second man to make the draw? Paulo Ferreira, Ash\u2019s former full-back partner at Chelsea, and someone very much involved with the club now. He won this competition with Porto (as the Uefa Cup in 2003) and Chelsea in 2013 ten years later. He wishes Frank Lampard all the best with Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea this season. Here come the Uefa suits to make sure this all goes swimmingly. Giorgio Marchetti starts on a sombre note by paying tribute to Luis Enrique, who lost his daughter to cancer yesterday. Who will be making the draw? Why, it\u2019s none other than Ashley Cole. \u201cWhen you know, you know,\u201d he says of his recent retirement, as he looks ahead to his coaching career which will start with Chelsea Under-15s. Andrzej Buncol, the ambassador for Gdansk, and a winner of the Uefa Cup with Bayer Leverkusen in 1988, recalls (in German) his memories of that two-legged win. Bayer were 3-0 down in the first leg to Espanyol and won 4-3. Three players are up for the Europa League player of the year: Olivier Giroud, Eden Hazard and Luka Jovic, then of Eintracht Frankfurt, now Hazard\u2019s teammate at Real Madrid. No surprise: the winner is Hazard, who appears by video and offers good luck to everyone playing. \u201cCiao, Ciao,\u201d he signs off. The balls have been warmed, the bon mots have been prepared and it\u2019s time to find out what \u201cEuro away\u201d your team has. Will there be a Battle of Britain? Who will get the furthest flung trip to Eastern Europe? We are just about to find out. Friend of the Guardian Darren Tulett is the master of ceremonies in Monaco. At present, we are watching a montage of the teams involved and some of the action from last season\u2019s competition, where Chelsea were the winners. The final this year will be in Gdansk. Like Lucy Bronze, Virgil van Dijk was gonged last night. Looks like Fernando Llorente, most recently of Spurs and linked with a potential move to Manchester United, is off to Napoli. The aforementioned Hamza Choudhury, not in Steve Bruce\u2019s good books after that tackle on Matt Ritchie, has signed a new deal at Leicester. The Manchester United manager Casey Stoney has been talking ahead of next week\u2019s WSL big kick-off. Get your previews here. The first for all the Premier League matches this weekend has landed and there will be more to follow. The England U21 squad has been announced. Aidy Boothroyd has selected Mason Greenwood, just 17, of Manchester United, in the squad to face Turkey and Kosovo. Norwich trio Max Aarons, Ben Godfrey and Todd Cantwell are included for the first time along with Arsenal\u2019s Eddie Nketiah, on loan at Leeds, Liverpool\u2019s Rhian Brewster and Bournemouth goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. It is Boothroyd\u2019s first squad since the summer\u2019s disappointing Euro 2019 where England failed to win a game and were knocked out in the group stage. Just three of the squad for Italy and San Marino who are still eligible have returned, Manchester City\u2019s Phil Foden, Arsenal\u2019s Reiss Nelson and Wolves midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White. Goalkeepers: Ellery Balcombe (Brentford), Aaron Ramsdale (AFC Bournemouth), Nathan Trott (AFC Wimbledon, loan from West Ham United) Defenders: Max Aarons (Norwich City), Trevoh Chalobah (Huddersfield Town, loan from Chelsea), Ben Godfrey (Norwich City), Marc Guehi (Chelsea), James Justin (Leicester City), Jonathan Panzo (AS Monaco), Steven Sessegnon (Fulham), Ben Wilmot (Swansea City, loan from Watford) Midfielders: Todd Cantwell (Norwich City), Tom Davies (Everton), Phil Foden (Manchester City), Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Dwight McNeil (Burnley), Omar Richards (Reading), Oliver Skipp (Tottenham Hotspur), Joe Willock (Arsenal) Forwards: Rhian Brewster (Liverpool), Mason Greenwood (Manchester United), Reiss Nelson (Arsenal), Eddie Nketiah (Leeds United, loan from Arsenal) Chris Wilder has been praising Frank Lampard, while seeking his Sheffield United team to bury Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. There\u2019s always been a lot of focus on Frank. His first game as manager of Derby was at Reading and got the season under way on a Friday night, right until the end at Derby in the play-off final. There was always all that \u2018Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County\u2019 stuff going around. Lots of folk used to laugh at it but, do you know what, for me that shows he was ready to deal with the pressure and knowing all eyes were on him. Now he\u2019s at Chelsea it\u2019s the same, it\u2019s even more intense. But he\u2019s doing a good job. He\u2019s got the job I think most of us knew he was always destined for given his history with the club and legendary status there, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do very well. He worked under some great managers at Chelsea and he\u2019ll have picked up lots from them. I\u2019m sure he will want to replicate the kind of career he had as a player at Chelsea now he is manager. That Europa League draw is coming at 12pm UK time, and here\u2019s a reminder on the pots. Wolves, Celtic and Rangers all went through. Hard lines on Linfield, who went out on away goals to Qarabag. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson from that Solskj\u00e6r presser. Taking of transfers, here\u2019s some tittle tattle from this morning. More Ole on United departures. I can see maybe Matteo [Darmian leaving]. There has been some interest in Matteo over in Italy, wanting to go back home. Marcos [Rojo], he\u2019s staying definitely. We\u2019ve got a squad now that\u2019s less in numbers, but still big enough and strong enough to have coverage in all positions. And on Alexis S\u00e1nchez: I think Alexis needed to go. Because at the moment we know he has been here now for 18 months and it\u2019s not really worked out for him. For him as well to restart and get himself playing regularly, getting himself scoring goals, that loan will benefit everyone in the end. For us, we\u2019re going to watch every weekend now to see Romelu (Lukaku) and Alexis playing together. And on Big Zlat, eyeing a comeback. \u201cWell, if he was 28 and not 38 next month it\u2019s a big difference! But Zlatan has had a great time here and of course he\u2019s still doing well. He was just unfortunate that he got his injury when he got it here. Who knows? He knows my number. He never rented my house but he was looking at it and we can speak a native language. If he\u2019s serious, I\u2019ll always speak to Zlatan... don\u2019t think that\u2019ll happen, no. I think he\u2019s had his time at the club. He\u2019s had a fantastic career and I wouldn\u2019t expect him to be serious either when he said that. On King Eric... Can he play centre-forward? Manchester United defender Chris Smalling is on his way to Italy to finalise a loan move to Roma, manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has revealed in his morning news conference. Phil Jones to Lazio? Of course we sat down yesterday and discussed it. At the moment we\u2019ve got six fit centre-backs. I couldn\u2019t promise Chris regular football. He\u2019s on the plane over now. I think he\u2019ll enjoy the experience over there. It\u2019s a big club, a good league. There\u2019s not many English players who have had the chance to play in Italy and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come back stronger and better for it. News from the Bundesliga, per Reuters. Former Bayern Munich captain Oliver Kahn is set to return to the club as a board member next year and will take over as chief executive in 2022. On the day current Bayern president Uli Hoeness announced his retirement from his decades-long involvement with the club, the German champions appointed another successful former Bayern player to succeed current CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Kahn, nicknamed \u2018the Titan\u2019 who won eight league titles between 1994 and 2008 with the Bavarians, signed a five-year contract after the board voted unanimously in favour of the move in Thursday\u2019s meeting. \u201cIt is a great honour to initially become a member of the board and then take over the chairman role at Bayern Munich,\u201d the 50-year-old Kahn, a former Germany captain, said in a statement. \u201cI am deeply linked with the club that has marked my life considerably.\u201d Trouble for Steve Bruce and Newcastle. Matt Ritchie could be out for up to two months with the ankle injury he suffered against Leicester after a \u2018tackle\u2019 by Hamza Choudhury. Quoth Brucey: \u201cIt\u2019s not great news. We think he\u2019s going to be maybe two months, eight weeks. There is ankle ligament damage too, bone bruising, cuts. The kid, as I said to you the other night, was a mess. Thankfully it\u2019s not six months, but it\u2019s bad enough when it\u2019s the best part of eight weeks. These tackles are the ones that damage you. Let\u2019s hope the young lad learns from it because he\u2019s a good player, the kid. But obviously, it doesn\u2019t help us and Matt in particular, who\u2019s going to miss at least a couple of months.\u201d Eric Cantona, the Zeus years. Talking of the England\u2019s women team, they drew 3-3 with Belgium last night. Doesn\u2019t look like Slavia Prague fancy their chances much. Bronze\u2019s award followed the Champions League draw, which Nick Ames ran the rule over. Some quotes from Lucy Bronze, unable to attend as she was playing for England against Belgium but whose mum wanted to go in her stead to Monaco to meet Cristiano Ronaldo. I\u2019m ecstatic and super-humbled to have won the award up against two fantastic players who I know really well at Lyon. I want to say a huge thanks to the Lionesses, the England team. We had a great summer and I don\u2019t think I would have won this award if it wasn\u2019t for them. The same goes for the Lyon team. We had an amazing season, we won the treble. I think any one of those girls could have been up here receiving this award. Congratulations, then, to Lucy Bronze, crowned Uefa\u2019s player of the year on Thursday in that glitzy ceremony in Monaco, give or take Eric Cantona\u2019s choice of evening wear. What a year she had, as a Champions League winner with Lyon and as England\u2019s star at the World Cup this summer. Her performance - and stunning goal - against Norway in the quarter-finals must have gone some way to pushing her to that award, though if the European body weighted its award on what she achieved in their competitions then Bronze was one of the stars of the European club season, too. Playing in the World Cup where Ada Ada Hegerberg sat out the final in France must have played their part for Bronze. The men\u2019s Uefa player of the year was Virgil van Dijk, for the defensive mastery that guided Liverpool to winning the Champions League in June. No rest for the wicked, no resting on laurels. Even ahead of the final set of Premier League matches ahead of the international break, there is the Europa League draw, which starts around midday London time. And that will feature Arsenal, Manchester United, Wolves, Celtic and Rangers.",

The disconnect between host and audience was painfully obvious within the first couple seconds of Maniscalco\u2019s opening monologue, kicking off with a corny joke about his mother\u2019s Italian cooking.

The latter outbreak was in a village near the Ebola River, giving the disease its name.</p>\n    <p>Ebola causes fever, aches and diarrhoea and attacks the immune system, causing blood clotting cells to malfunction so that victims bleed extensively and die if their immune system cannot fight off the viral infection. It is spread from person to person through body fluids.</p>\n    <p>Infected patients are isolated and treated by medical teams wearing full protective body suits who try to boost their immune response. The average case fatality rate is around 50% - and health-care workers have frequently been infected.

      "bodyText": "A nine-year-old Congolese girl who tested positive for Ebola in neighbouring Uganda has died of the disease, as the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that the current outbreak was approaching the grim milestone of 3,000 cases and 2,000 deaths. Her death makes her the fourth case to cross into Uganda amid the continuing struggle to contain the deadly outbreak. \u201cShe passed on at around eight o\u2019clock this morning,\u201d said Yusuf Baseka, health director in Kasese, a district in southwestern Uganda along the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The child was diagnosed after exhibiting symptoms at a border crossing in Kasese on Wednesday. Eddy Kasenda, Ebola representative in the Congolese border town of Kasindi, said the girl\u2019s body would be repatriated for burial. \u201cWe are finalising the administrative formalities so that the body is repatriated and buried here in Congo, her native country,\u201d said Kasenda. \u201cWe are collaborating with the health services of neighbouring Uganda and we will strengthen the sanitary measures here in Kasindi.\u201d Although cases of cross-border contamination have been rare, this case highlights the risk of Ebola spreading across borders into neighbouring Uganda and Rwanda. Borders in the region are often porous, and many people travelling at night use bush paths to cross over. More than 25% of fatalities from the disease have been children in an epidemic with a higher than usual death rate. \u201cThis has been a particularly deadly outbreak, with a mortality rate of 67%, far higher than the 55% average case fatality rate for Ebola,\u201d Heather Kerr, Save the Children\u2019s country director in DRC, said in a statement warning that the epidemic was still \u201cnot under control\u201d. \u201cThe youngest are the hardest hit \u2013 well over 500 children have died, many more have lost at least one of their parents or can no longer go to school because schools are closed or they have to work to make ends meet.\u201d Joyce Moriku Kaducu, state minister for primary health, said on Thursday: \u201cThe ministry of health, with support from partners, have dispatched a rapid response team to Kasese to support the district teams to continue with various activities including case management, community engagement, contact tracing, psychological support and vaccination, among others.\u201d \u201cThe ministry of health re-echoes its call to the general public to cooperate with the health workers, immigration and security officials to ensure effective screening at all points of entry to prevent the spread of Ebola to other parts of the country. The ministry of health reassures all Ugandans \u2026 the disease will be contained.\u201d An average of 80 people per week are sickened by the virus, with the Congo\u2019s North Kivu province being the hardest hit. Insecurity has been one factor in a region where rebel groups have fought for control of mineral-rich lands for decades. Ebola also has spread because of mistrust by communities who have also staged attacks against health workers. Many people in eastern Congo don\u2019t trust doctors and other medics. \u201cMany people are afraid to seek treatment for illnesses, worried they will be sent to an Ebola treatment centre where they fear they could contract the disease. As an actor within the response, we must assume our own responsibility,\u201d said Bob Kitchen, vice-president of emergencies at the International Rescue Committee. \u201cOne year into the response, the lack of community acceptance remains the single greatest obstacle to containing the outbreak. Building trust with the community doesn\u2019t just mean dialogue with the affected population. It means working with the community to adapt the response and address the overall needs they are facing inside and outside of the Ebola outbreak.\u201d In June, a family of Congolese with some sick family members crossed into Uganda via a bush path. Two of them later died of Ebola, and the others were transferred back to Congo. Uganda has had multiple outbreaks of Ebola and hemorrhagic fevers since 2000. The WHO\u2019s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will travel this weekend to Congo with UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and senior officials, including Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. On Friday he called on partners to increase their presence in the field. \u201cOur commitment to the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is that we will work alongside them to stop the Ebola outbreak,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cOur commitment also means strengthening the health systems to give them all the other things they need.

But concertgoers have complained that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/25/fans-left-with-invalid-tickets-in-ed-sheeran-anti-tout-scheme-viagogo\">methods used by the singer-songwriter\u2019s team to combat touts</a> ended up hurting innocent fans.</p> <p>Sheeran devotees who bought tickets, but later found they could not attend the gig, were permitted to use so-called \u201cfan-to-fan\u201d resale sites that allow users to sell to one another. For the Divide tour, prices were set at the face value of the ticket plus a 10% \u201cresale fee\u201d, in an apparent effort to provide an alternative to sites such as StubHub and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/viagogo\">Viagogo</a>, which have been criticised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/30/viagogo-what-is-it-secondary-ticketing-website\">exploiting music lovers</a>.</p> <p>But angry fans said they were unable to offload tickets on the platforms authorised for Sheeran\u2019s concerts because seats were still available at face value up until the day of the event. This meant that last-minute buyers snapped up those face value tickets, rather than pay a 10% premium to buy the ones listed by fans unable to attend.</p> <p>The outcome appears to be at odds with advice issued to event organisers earlier this year by the Competition and Markets Authority, the consumer watchdog. It said promoters and venues should either offer a full refund to ticket buyers who cannot attend an event, or provide arrangements that allow them to \u201crecoup or substantially reduce any direct financial loss\u201d.</p> <p>George Fox, a 20-year-old student, told the Guardian that he offered to help a family member offload four tickets to see Sheeran in Leeds, because the gig clashed with a holiday.

      "bodyText": "Ed Sheeran fans claim they have been left hundreds of pounds out of pocket after measures to prevent ticket touting during his record-breaking Divide tour backfired. Sheeran and his promotion company Kilimanjaro Live have been at the forefront of a battle with resale platforms such as Viagogo, which are used by touts to sell tickets for popular gigs, often at vast mark-ups. But concertgoers have complained that the methods used by the singer-songwriter\u2019s team to combat touts ended up hurting innocent fans. Sheeran devotees who bought tickets, but later found they could not attend the gig, were permitted to use so-called \u201cfan-to-fan\u201d resale sites that allow users to sell to one another. For the Divide tour, prices were set at the face value of the ticket plus a 10% \u201cresale fee\u201d, in an apparent effort to provide an alternative to sites such as StubHub and Viagogo, which have been criticised for exploiting music lovers. But angry fans said they were unable to offload tickets on the platforms authorised for Sheeran\u2019s concerts because seats were still available at face value up until the day of the event. This meant that last-minute buyers snapped up those face value tickets, rather than pay a 10% premium to buy the ones listed by fans unable to attend. The outcome appears to be at odds with advice issued to event organisers earlier this year by the Competition and Markets Authority, the consumer watchdog. It said promoters and venues should either offer a full refund to ticket buyers who cannot attend an event, or provide arrangements that allow them to \u201crecoup or substantially reduce any direct financial loss\u201d. George Fox, a 20-year-old student, told the Guardian that he offered to help a family member offload four tickets to see Sheeran in Leeds, because the gig clashed with a holiday. He says he was left nursing a loss of \u00a3340. \u201cIt [price restrictions] meant I was unable to sell the tickets or recoup any money with the price being locked [\u2026] because why would anybody buy tickets for face value plus 10% when face value tickets exist? \u201cThat meant Ed\u2019s team selling more [of their own tickets] as nobody could buy off anybody else who couldn\u2019t go. Thousands went to waste, to their advantage, whether intentional or not.\u201d Several other fans complained of resale restrictions, via Twitter. A spokesperson for Kilimanjaro Live said: \u201cFrom the outset we have tried to find a way to be fair to fans, to facilitate the ethical resale of tickets and to leave as many fans as happy as possible whilst preventing the daily horror stories of them being ripped off by ticket touts profiting from the panic to get a ticket to see Ed. We have undoubtedly had a huge impact here. \u201cWhilst we understand the frustration of someone who is unable to resell and wants to drop the price accordingly to give themselves a better chance of recouping some of their money, unfortunately this throws up more questions than answers.\u201d Kilimanjaro Live said it did not want to allow ticket owners to cut the price of their tickets below face value, because consumers who had paid full price would end up feeling ripped off. But the promotion company did not explain why sellers were not permitted to sell tickets at exactly face value, or sell them back to the box office. \u201cAn Ed Sheeran ticket on this tour costs around \u00a385 to \u00a390, and that\u2019s a price point that we have set all along \u2013 and one that industry stats suggest as being of really good value for the size of venue on this tour,\u201d said a spokesperson.",

      "bodyText": "Florida is bracing for what could be the biggest hurricane to hit the state\u2019s east coast in more than a quarter of a century, as Hurricane Dorian threatened to make landfall at the weekend with winds potentially in excess of 130mph. Florida governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for every Florida county. Donald Trump issued a video Thursday warning that the storm \u201ccould be an absolute monster\u201d. The National Weather Service said Dorian, which was building strength east of the Bahamas, would become a major hurricane on Friday afternoon. The winds from the storm were expected to arrive on the Florida coast on Sunday morning, in the middle of the Labor Day holiday weekend. If Dorian lands as a category 4 storm, it could be the most powerful hurricane to affect the east coast of Florida since Hurricane Andrew roared ashore in 1992, causing devastating damage and killing 65 people. In 2004, Hurricane Frances arrived in Florida as a Category 2 hurricane, killed 37 in Florida and wreaked damage costing billions. Trump has canceled his forthcoming trip this weekend to Poland as the storm approaches. Millions of Floridians on Friday were stockpiling water, food, fuel and materials such as plywood to board up properties. They have been advised to track the storm closely. Florida has called 2,500 National Guard troops into action and put a further 1,500 on stand-by as the hurricane spins off the south-western shore, roaring north-west towards the Bahamas and strengthening overnight into Friday, with winds of 105mph and gusts up to 125mph. On Friday morning it was a category 2 hurricane out in the ocean and is increasingly likely to be a category 4 when it makes landfall, indicating winds over 130mph. Forecasting maps modeling the path of the hurricane showed a good chance that it may hit Miami or further north, including Palm Beach or Orlando, but experts emphasized on Friday morning that it was too early to be certain and that this storm is very unpredictable. It was announced on Thursday that the vice-president, Mike Pence, will travel to Poland in the president\u2019s stead. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico\u2019s citizens breathed a sigh of relief this week at having avoided major damage from Hurricane Dorian, after it had been on a path this week to hit the US island territory directly. DeSantis urged residents to take precautionary measures including stockpiling water, canned food and other emergency supplies. \u201cDorian could be a major hurricane,\u201d DeSantis tweeted. \u201cAll Floridians on the east coast should have seven days of supplies, prepare their homes and follow the track closely.\u201d Georgia, another state potentially in the storm\u2019s path, also declared a state of emergency for 12 counties nearest the state\u2019s coastline. Governor Brian Kemp said the storm \u201chas the potential to produce catastrophic impacts to citizens\u201d throughout the south-east coastal region of the United States. One predicted track has the storm on course to hit Palm Beach county in southern Florida, the location of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. According to the Tampa Bay Times the president\u2019s ocean-front property, often referred to as \u201cthe winter White House\u201d, lies within the so called \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d\u2013 the potential range of paths the hurricane could take. DeSantis said he had spoken on the phone with Trump, who pledged support. The hurricane center advised that heavy rains from the storm were expected to occur over portions of the Bahamas, Florida, and elsewhere in the south-eastern US \u201clater this week and into early next week\u201d.",

The price of this involvement is our vulnerability.\u201d A life in which nothing could hurt would be one in which nothing could matter. One useful thought comes from the psychologist Harriet Lerner, in an interview with New York magazine, who suggests abandoning the \u201cthick skin\u201d metaphor for a different one. \u201cI picture every person as standing on a platform of self-worth,\u201d she says. If it\u2019s broad and strong \u2013 if you\u2019re part of a rich network of relationships, if you have multiple sources of self-esteem, and so on \u2013 then bad things will still feel bad, but in a different context. Resilience of this sort can accommodate pain, so you needn\u2019t obsessively avoid its causes, nor squelch it down inside. You can be OK, even when you\u2019re not OK . Listen to this Philosopher Todd May makes the case for \u201cvulnerabilism\u201d in his book A Fragile Life and in an episode of the podcast This Is Not A Pipe oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "A suspect arrested last week over the killing of a Chechen dissident in Berlin was carrying a passport whose number linked him to Russian security services, German media have reported. Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, who fought against Russia during the second Chechen war in the early 2000s, was shot twice in the head at close range in the Kleiner Tiergarten park in central Berlin just before midday last Friday. A Russian national who was detained near the scene after being spotted throwing a bicycle and a gun into the River Spree was carrying visa documents that identified him as 49-year-old Vadim Andreevich Sokolov, born in Irkutsk, Siberia, and based in St Petersburg. However, a person of that name could not be found in Russia\u2019s national passport register nor in the country\u2019s driving licence register, Der Spiegel reported. At a Paris hotel listed as a residence in the visa documents, receptionists could not recall having seen the man, the magazine\u2019s researchers found. A joint investigation by Der Spiegel, Bellingcat and The Insider found that the passport number could be linked to a unit in Moscow\u2019s interior ministry that in the past has issued ID documents for the military security service GRU. The findings add further fuel to suspicions of a state-backed assassination similar to the attempt carried out against the former Russian military officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, Britain, in 2018. On Wednesday the Kremlin denied any involvement in the killing, which took place on the same day that Germany\u2019s foreign minister was visiting Moscow. \u201cI categorically reject any link between this incident, this murder, and official Russia,\u201d said Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov.",

As the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of the second world war approaches on Sunday and European leaders head to Poland for commemorations, the bloody events of 80 years ago are being politicised and exploited more than ever across the continent.

Ten years ago, on the 70th anniversary, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Merkel met at Westerplatte, and there were signs that European nations may be edging closer to reconciliation over the terrible events of the war.

In Britain, the war effort and casualties are regularly invoked in discussions about Brexit, leaving the outgoing German ambassador to suggest that the obsession with Britain fighting the Nazis does little to solve the problems of today. In Russia, Putin has gradually transformed the war victory and the enormous Soviet sacrifice in the war into a bombastic celebration and a chance for militaristic posturing. In eastern Ukraine, Russian-backed forces have gone into battle carrying flags inspired by the second world war victory. In the run-up to the anniversary, the Russian government launched a campaign to rehabilitate the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, signed between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union a week before the attack on Westerplatte, which included secret protocols by which the two powers would divide eastern Europe.

      "bodyText": "The spread of communicable diseases among vulnerable groups and problems with mental health care provision are likely to increase in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to a group of public health academics. They criticise the government\u2019s secretive approach on post-Brexit health, saying at least 26 non-disclosure agreements have been imposed on advisers. \u201cThe government\u2019s claims that it is prepared for no deal are implausible and at best [its preparations] might mitigate some of the worst consequences,\u201d they say in a paper published in the British Medical Journal. They say no deal would be likely to increase the difficulties for people already facing poverty, poor housing options and underfunded local services. In the event of a post-Brexit recession, they say, \u201clikely consequences include rises in suicides, alcohol-related deaths and some communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis and HIV, especially among vulnerable groups\u201d. The paper\u2019s authors include Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM); Tim Lang, a professor of food policy and consultant to the World Health Organization; and Maggie Rae, the president of the Faculty of Public Health, an association representing 4,000 public health professionals. The paper says a no-deal Brexit would risk exacerbating health challenges and affecting life expectancy in some areas, and there is potential for medicine and food shortages as well as compromised supply chains, governance and funding. The authors say they found no evidence in their research that the government had done a proper impact assessment on no deal and health, and they call for an urgent independent review. The paper attempts to identify risks other than those already widely reported such as shortages of medicines such as cancer drugs. Meanwhile, 11 organisations including the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing have said no deal could disrupt the supply of medicines to the country for up to six months. \u201cMany medicines, including life-saving agents for cancer diagnosis and therapy, cannot be stockpiled, and for those that can, stockpiles could run out,\u201d they said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cAs part of a responsible government, the department is doing everything appropriate to prepare for Brexit. \u201cThe public health system will continue to work 24/7 to keep the country safe from infectious disease and to keep us healthy and well. Alcohol consumption is falling, we are committed to eliminating new transmissions of HIV by 2030, and our new green paper on prevention includes many other ways to improve the public\u2019s health. \u201cWe want to reassure patients that we should be fully prepared for leaving on 31 October, whatever the circumstances.\u201d",

The official industry-wide deadline for making a claim passed on Thursday night and Santander was one of several banks plagued by technical problems during the final hours of the campaign. The Financial Conduct Authority said it would expect banks that experienced technical problems in the run-up to the deadline to \u201ctreat customers fairly\u201d and \u201capply a pragmatic approach\u201d. Santander said on its website later that \u201cdue to the high volume of customers contacting us about PPI\u201d, it would extend its deadline. A spokesperson said it would accept complaints and inquiries made over the phone and via its online form until 8pm on Friday. Santander had already apologised for a \u201cbrief technical issue\u201d on Thursday morning that meant customers were unable to access its online claim form for a time. Throughout Thursday some people continued to report on social media that they were having problems submitting their details to the bank. NatWest and the Co-operative Bank were among the other banks that experienced technical problems, and complaints of long waiting times on the phone were common.

      "bodyText": "Staff at Science Museum sites across England have begun a 24-hour strike in protest over low pay. The action comes after the group\u2019s directors refused to increase a below inflation 1.5% pay rise offered to more than 75% of staff this year. On Friday, hundreds of workers picketed outside museums in London, Manchester, Bradford, York and Wiltshire. Laurel Mackie, 42, an explainer who helps to put on shows and demonstrations at the Science Museum in south Kensington, joined the protest with her son Albert, seven. She said she earned less than the London living wage and found the cost of childcare a \u201cstruggle\u201d. \u201cTravel is expensive too,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to think about what time of day I travel which can be a bit of a rush when you\u2019re with a child.\u201d Mackie said she loved her job but wanted the Science Museum to pay staff a real living wage, similar to the nearby Natural History and Victoria and Albert museums in south-west London.

Alvares added that he was \u201cbarely making enough to break even\u201d and struggling to pay for travel from his home near Heathrow. The strike meant that some activities were not running at the Science Museum in South Kensington, the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, the National Railway Museum in York and the National Collections Centre in Wroughton.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Sajid Javid, was not informed in advance about the sacking of one of his senior advisers by Boris Johnson\u2019s strategist Dominic Cummings, it has emerged. Sonia Khan, Javid\u2019s media adviser, was escorted from No 10 by a police officer after being accused of misleading Cummings over her contact with individuals close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond, who has been trying to block a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street rebuffed speculation that she had leaked the government\u2019s no-deal planning report, Operation Yellowhammer, to the press. Khan was the second adviser working for Javid to be sacked by No 10, leading to suggestions that Javid is becoming increasingly isolated from the core of the Johnson regime. One former Whitehall colleague of Khan\u2019s said: \u201cLet\u2019s hope Saj makes a stand and sticks up for her. I won\u2019t hold my breath though.\u201d This week, Javid\u2019s first major speech on the economy was cancelled 24 hours before he had been due to deliver it in Birmingham. Downing Street, rather than the Treasury, announced a proposed cut to fuel duty that had been briefed to the papers over the weekend. A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual staffing and personnel matters.\u201d A fiery exchange between Cummings and Khan is understood to have revolved around whether she had had contact with a former Hammond staff member. It is understood Khan was asked to hand over her work phone, and also presented her personal phone to Cummings. Downing Street made clear that Khan was not being blamed for the leak of the Yellowhammer documents on no-deal planning. A senior government source said: \u201cSonia Khan was not responsible for the Yellowhammer leak.\u201d Whitehall sources confirmed that the reason Khan was dismissed on the spot was because she had been in contact with people from a group of Conservative politicians working against Johnson by trying to work out ways to avoid a no-deal Brexit, and that she had lied about her contact with them. Three other women in senior advisory, policy and organisational roles in the Conservative party have also left since Johnson became prime minister. Sources close to the government have described an emerging pattern in the way they have been dismissed, which they have described as \u201copaque and shocking\u201d and not always involving a clear explanation of what they have done wrong. One Tory insider said the way some former staffers had been treated by No 10 was \u201chorrific\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Wolverhampton Wanderers were handed an encouraging draw on their return to European competition proper for the first time in 38 years, when they avoided big-name opposition in a Europa League group that pits them against Besiktas of Turkey, Braga of Portugal and Slovan Bratislava of Slovakia. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo will be happier than Unai Emery with the draw, for Arsenal\u2019s opponents in Group A include Eintracht Frankfurt and Standard Li\u00e8ge, while Manchester United face demanding trips to Partizan Belgrade and Astana of Kazakhstan. Eintracht reached the semi-finals of the Europa League last season, losing to Chelsea, though they have since parted with two of their most impressive players in Luka Jovic and S\u00e9bastien Haller, sold to Real Madrid and West Ham respectively. Of the British teams in the draw the lower-seeded Scottish sides found themselves with perhaps the most testing programmes. Celtic are in an attractive Group E with Lazio, Rennes and Cluj, while Rangers will have arguably the toughest test in emerging from a group featuring Porto, Feyenoord and Young Boys of Switzerland. Arsenal went all the way to the final last season, to be beaten 4-1 in Baku by Chelsea. The 2020 final will be staged in Gdansk, Poland, which is not such a challenging prospect for teams and supporters from this country, though in terms of arduous trips in this season\u2019s group stage Manchester United have drawn the short straw with games in Kazakhstan and Serbia in addition to Alkmaar of the Netherlands. Thursday night football notoriously tends to impact on a team\u2019s performance the following weekend, and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and his players face a round trip of 6,000 miles to reach Astana. Arsenal\u2019s opponents can at least be relatively conveniently reached, while Wolves\u2019 Portuguese manager will relish a trip to Braga. Besiktas might be a challenge for a side that reached the group stage via a final play-off victory over Torino this week, though Wolves will be confident of picking up points against their Portuguese and Slovakian opponents. While Lazio might be Celtic\u2019s most illustrious opponents in Group E, Rennes should not be underestimated after their recent victory against Paris Saint-Germain in the French league, and Neil Lennon and his players need no introduction to Cluj having played them this month. The Romanian champions knocked Celtic out of the Champions League with a 4-3 win, after Celtic appeared to have done the hard work by gaining a 1-1 draw in the away leg. Dan Petrescu\u2019s side went on to lose to Slavia Prague in the Champions League play-off round, which is why they are back facing familiar opponents in the Europa League. \u201cThere are some glamour ties to look forward to and maybe we can exact some retribution against Cluj,\u201d the Celtic manager said. \u201cRennes are a good side too, they won the cup in France last season, but I think we can make a good impact in the group.\u201d In Group G the Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard, will be aware that the Swiss champions, Young Boys, gave Manchester United a decent game in the Champions League at Old Trafford last season, that Porto were runners-up in the Portuguese league while Jaap Stam\u2019s Feyenoord finished third in the Eredivisie.",

In neighbouring Saxony, polls show the AfD to be floundering in the final stretch of the campaign, on track for second place on 24.5% behind a resurgent Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on 32%. The revelation of Kalbitz\u2019s neo-Nazi links is the latest detail to undermine efforts to lend the rightwing populist party a respectable face. This month the newspaper Die Welt unearthed two documentaries about the second world war listing Kalbitz as a scriptwriter alongside his late father-in-law Stuart Russell, a UK citizen who served in the British army in Germany and later settled near Paderborn. Thomas Weber, a history professor at the University of Aberdeen, described one of the films, Hitler: The Unknown Soldier, 1914-1918, as a \u201cskilful glorification of Hitler\u201d, which uncritically digested National Socialist propaganda and portrayed the first world war as the result of an \u201cevil alliance\u201d of Jews and Marxists. Kalbitz told Die Welt he had helped with the script for the film because the father of his wife was not a native speaker, and he insisted Russell \u201cwas not a rightwing radical or extremist\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cBoxing is a brutal sport,\u201d Vasiliy Lomachenko says quietly as, on a beautiful day on a sunlit terrace in London, he considers how a fighter can lose his life in the ring. Moments earlier his arms had been spread wide on the back of a sofa so I could see the Olympic rings and the words Beijing 2008 and London 2012 tattooed into his skin in honour of the two gold medals he won as an amateur. They are a reminder that Lomachenko has one of the greatest records in the history of amateur boxing \u2013 having won 396 fights and lost just one.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.ringtv.com/ratings/\" title=\"\">He is now regarded widely as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the professional game</a>. Last year, in only his 12th pro contest, he won his third world title at a different weight. No other fighter in boxing history had become a three-division champion so quickly. His long list of achievements are matched by the superlatives which follow almost every Lomachenko fight. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE2ohIYBg3w\" title=\"\">His dazzling footwork and technique</a>, combined with the exquisite geometry of his ringcraft and the venom in his fists, mean that Lomachenko is unlike any other fighter in boxing today.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/29/luke-campbell-vasiliy-lomachenko-world-title-fight-boxing\">Luke Campbell confident he can pull off huge upset against Vasyl Lomachenko</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But even the 31-year-old Ukrainian is not immune to boxing\u2019s deadly realities. Steeling himself for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/29/luke-campbell-vasiliy-lomachenko-world-title-fight-boxing\" title=\"\">WBC, WBA and WBO world lightweight fight against Luke Campbell</a> on Saturday at the O2 Arena , Lomachenko\u2019s relaxed mood becomes serious.</p> \n<p>He lowers his elbows on to the table and rests his chin on his fists as he remembers his friend, Maxim Dadashev, who died last month after a world title eliminator in Maryland.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course I knew Max very well,\u201d Lomachenko says of Dadashev, a 28-year-old Russian light-welterweight who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmGXuQBp6AA\" title=\"\">lost his life so tragically</a>. \u201cWe were friends and he helped me a few times to prepare for my fights. I sparred with him and he was at my house [in Oxnard, California] quite often. He was a very good person. But it\u2019s the life we all live as fighters.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dadashev was not some no-hoper or washed-up journeyman. Rather, he was an unbeaten prospect who stepped into the ring against Subriel Matias, a Puerto Rican light-welterweight. Dadashev and Matias mirrored each other with their perfect 13-0 records.But the fight soon tilted in favour of Matias and Dadashev suffered a systematic beating. Buddy McGirt, the experienced American trainer in Dadashev\u2019s corner, had already decided at the end of the 11th round that he was going to stop the bout.

But afterwards I was very shocked.\u201d</p> \n<p>Did the distressing news make Lomachenko think more deeply about the consequences of boxing and the possibility of not fighting again?</p> \n<p>Lomachenko is about to answer when Klimas asks, softly: \u201cCan we change the subject?\u201d</p> \n<p>I can see how upset Klimas looks, <a href=\"https://en.crimerussia.com/gromkie-dela/becoming-a-champion-and-supporting-a-family-boxer-maxim-dadashev-s-notes-found-after-his-death/\" title=\"\">because he also managed Dadashev</a>, and so it seems right to switch tack. But it is striking that, when I ask Lomachenko if he feels fear before a fight, he offers a layered answer. \u201cNo. I always stay in focus and go in the ring very calm. But before a fight I am nervous. I don\u2019t show you this. But of course I\u2019m nervous.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBoxing is a brutal sport,\u201d Vasiliy Lomachenko says quietly as, on a beautiful day on a sunlit terrace in London, he considers how a fighter can lose his life in the ring. Moments earlier his arms had been spread wide on the back of a sofa so I could see the Olympic rings and the words Beijing 2008 and London 2012 tattooed into his skin in honour of the two gold medals he won as an amateur. They are a reminder that Lomachenko has one of the greatest records in the history of amateur boxing \u2013 having won 396 fights and lost just one. He is now regarded widely as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the professional game. Last year, in only his 12th pro contest, he won his third world title at a different weight. No other fighter in boxing history had become a three-division champion so quickly. His long list of achievements are matched by the superlatives which follow almost every Lomachenko fight. His dazzling footwork and technique, combined with the exquisite geometry of his ringcraft and the venom in his fists, mean that Lomachenko is unlike any other fighter in boxing today. But even the 31-year-old Ukrainian is not immune to boxing\u2019s deadly realities. Steeling himself for his WBC, WBA and WBO world lightweight fight against Luke Campbell on Saturday at the O2 Arena , Lomachenko\u2019s relaxed mood becomes serious. He lowers his elbows on to the table and rests his chin on his fists as he remembers his friend, Maxim Dadashev, who died last month after a world title eliminator in Maryland. \u201cOf course I knew Max very well,\u201d Lomachenko says of Dadashev, a 28-year-old Russian light-welterweight who lost his life so tragically. \u201cWe were friends and he helped me a few times to prepare for my fights. I sparred with him and he was at my house [in Oxnard, California] quite often. He was a very good person. But it\u2019s the life we all live as fighters.\u201d Dadashev was not some no-hoper or washed-up journeyman. Rather, he was an unbeaten prospect who stepped into the ring against Subriel Matias, a Puerto Rican light-welterweight. Dadashev and Matias mirrored each other with their perfect 13-0 records.But the fight soon tilted in favour of Matias and Dadashev suffered a systematic beating. Buddy McGirt, the experienced American trainer in Dadashev\u2019s corner, had already decided at the end of the 11th round that he was going to stop the bout. But, out of respect for his fighter, he asked Dadashev for permission to throw in the towel. \u201cNo,\u201d Dadashev said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting hit too much, Max,\u201d McGirt urged. \u201cPlease let me do this, please?\u201d Dadashev did not agree but, just before the bell for the last round, McGirt waved the fight over. After he fell ill in his dressing room, Dadashev was rushed to hospital. Emergency surgery attempted to relieve the pressure caused by a subdural hematoma on his brain and Dadashev was placed in a medically-induced coma. He died four days later, on 23 July. \u201cFor me it was a big shock,\u201d Lomachenko says as, sitting next to Egil Klimas, his manager, he becomes more reflective. \u201cMax was doing very well as a boxer. So when he finished the fight I called Egil and asked: \u2018How is Max?\u2019 It was then I heard Max went to the hospital. We were all very worried and over the next few days I was in touch all the time. But afterwards I was very shocked.\u201d Did the distressing news make Lomachenko think more deeply about the consequences of boxing and the possibility of not fighting again? Lomachenko is about to answer when Klimas asks, softly: \u201cCan we change the subject?\u201d I can see how upset Klimas looks, because he also managed Dadashev, and so it seems right to switch tack. But it is striking that, when I ask Lomachenko if he feels fear before a fight, he offers a layered answer. \u201cNo. I always stay in focus and go in the ring very calm. But before a fight I am nervous. I don\u2019t show you this. But of course I\u2019m nervous. Every athlete has this feeling\u2026\u201d Lomachenko talks to Klimas in Ukrainian as they try to find the right words. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel comfortable,\u201d Klimas says in English as he describes the unsettling emotions Lomachenko and Campbell will experience as they wait for the lonely hours to pass before they walk to the ring. It explains why Lomachenko insists he will not underestimate the British fighter who also won Olympic gold at London 2012. Asked if the fact that Campbell is bigger and taller, with a longer reach, will present his most obvious difficulties, Lomachenko reacts calmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. But I prepare for this. I prepare with a guy who is twice as big as Luke Campbell. But nobody knows for sure until the fight starts.\u201d In his last bout, against another English boxer in Anthony Crolla, Lomachenko was imperious and ruthless. Crolla looked like he was bent on survival until, in the fourth round, he finally tried to engage with Lomachenko. The Mancunian said later that it was the worst thing he could have done \u2013 because he was immediately dropped and stopped. \u201c[Crolla] didn\u2019t believe he could win.

On Tuesday afternoon, the 39-year-old racer was killed trying to break the 512mph women\u2019s absolute land-speed record set in 1976 by Kitty O\u2019Neil, who died last November.</p> <p>To the world, Combs was either the \u201cFastest Woman on Four Wheels\u201d, a guest of the hit TV show Mythbusters or the former host of Xtreme 4x4, Overhaulin<em>\u2019</em> and All Girls Garage. To WyoTech campus director Caleb Perriton, she was a devoted alum and role model for his three daughters. To Valerie Thompson, the \u201cAmerican Queen of Speed\u201d and first woman to exceed 300mph on a motorcycle, Combs was the one woman whose passion for speed meant rewriting the record books.</p> <p>A native of Rapid City, Combs was the daughter enamoured by the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally just 28 miles from home and who would gleefully await the chance to smash a four-wheeler over boulders and ram through the narrowest crevices of the Black Hills. Combs spoke reverently of her liberated, rural upbringing that could feature rock climbing one day, cliff jumping on another and four-wheel racing on the weekends.</p> <p>\u201cSouth Dakota was a place where you could take risks,\u201d Combs said in a 2014 interview with MidCo Sports Network. \u201cYou could break barriers and get away with it.\u201d</p> <p>To high school classmate Greta Holzwarth, she was the fellow Stevens High School cheerleader with the most spirit in uniform and that \u201cbig, shitty grin\u201d of the first person to try something that her teammates wouldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m guessing cheerleader isn\u2019t what people expect when discussing the fastest woman on four wheels,\u201d Holzwarth says.</p> <p>When Combs graduated from Stevens High, she immersed herself in a world of mechanics and engineering at WyoTech, a Laramie, Wyoming-based institute for careers in the automotive and diesel industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bad7fd1de298cda3bdd6b2df2a8eeffbf281e260\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bad7fd1de298cda3bdd6b2df2a8eeffbf281e260/0_168_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessi Combs nears the finish line of the Smitty Built Everyman\u2019s Challenge Race in Lucerne Valley, California, in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessi Combs nears the finish line of the Smitty Built Everyman\u2019s Challenge Race in Lucerne Valley, California, in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Quigg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Combs was the unlikely celebrity from WyoTech, though fame never kept her from returning to a campus of blue-collar kids pursuing blue-collar vocations. She\u2019d remind incoming freshmen that she arrived in Laramie hundreds of miles from home. Was anybody in the audience afraid of denials from the financial aid office? A few years ago, Jessi Combs was too. Did any women in the audience feel scared to pursue the male-dominated world of metal fabricating? It wasn\u2019t long ago that the Fastest Woman on Four Wheels did too.</p> <p>\u201cThe last time she was on campus, there were a handful of female students seeking her advice,\u201d Perriton says. \u201cThey\u2019d mention anecdotally that that was why she came to the school. She set the trend for women in a male-dominated industry. And that isn\u2019t really debatable. She proved personal ambition, work ethic and so forth can guide anybody and she broke down a lot of barriers.\u201d</p> <p>After graduating at the top of her class, she was hired by the marketing department to build a car for showcase at a major trade show. Before long, she\u2019d make the seamless transition into television while conquering the racing circuit.</p> <p>Combs was showcased as a student during a Season One episode of the TLC show Overhaulin\u2019, a show she\u2019d eventually co-host after her involvement with Xtreme 4x4, All Girls Garage and the wildly popular Discovery channel show Mythbusters. Her growing celebrity didn\u2019t interrupt her active participation on the racing circuit, where she drove everything from monster trucks to rally cars to hot rods. If somebody needed a stunt driver, an off-roader or a drifter, Combs could do it. If the vehicle had a mechanical problem, she was equipped to fix it.</p> <p>\u201cIf you need to know anything about Jessi, it was that she was the real deal,\u201d says Jim Ryan, the sales and marketing director of the off-road racing body Score International. \u201cShe knew everything from the inside out and make repairs in the field. She wasn\u2019t somebody simply trying to achieve something. Whatever she was involved in, she respected.\u201d</p> <p>Whether it was racing the notoriously grueling Baja 100 \u2013 Score International\u2019s signature race in Baja, California, that spans over 800 miles \u2013 or trying to break land speed records, Combs\u2019s zest for new challenges throughout racing garnered universal respect from her peers.</p> <p>\u201cI want to be in the Guinness Book of World Records,\u201d Combs said in her 2014 interview with MidCo. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have the patience to grow the longest fingernails in the world. Why not be the fastest woman on four wheels? It makes complete sense.\u201d</p> <p>In that interview, Combs admitted that she thought she\u2019d return to Rapid City to build motorcycles for a living after college. Instead, she became the woman who could build a car or motorcycle from the ground up and race it to victory. To a generation of women aspiring to compete in motorsports or pursue metal fabrication and auto detailing, Combs was an icon. Her influence even inspired Valerie Thompson, a seven-time motorcycle land-speed record holder. The two led Combs\u2019s beloved Sturgis rally and formed a kinship as two women atop their respective fields. When Thompson crashed in March 2018 after reaching 363mph, Combs visited to ask how she was recovering physically and emotionally.</p> <p>\u201cShe could see when I was trying to be a big girl and when I wasn\u2019t being authentic,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cI realised that not many women ever get to experience what we do. We live life fearlessly. Her legacy will live on and it will live through mostly people she\u2019s never met. She was a proven example of what women can do.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson was outfitted for the North American Eagle, the car Combs was navigating at the time of her death. As the investigation continues to reveal what caused Combs\u2019s crash, her family, boyfriend Terry Madden and racing team are struggling to convey what they\u2019ve lost in the tragedy\u2019s aftermath. Madden, a member of Combs\u2019s team, shared a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1tUB2lHGKX/\">heartfelt message detailing the crash</a> on Wednesday. Thompson is due to attend Speed Week at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in September, but admits to furiously refreshing her computer to learn more details about the accident.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I know what happened, I can let my heart rest,\u201d Thomspon says. \u201cI haven\u2019t recovered from my own accident and I was a former pilot for this car. I started that car and turned on the afterburners even if I didn\u2019t race it.\u201d</p> <p>While the motor sports community lost an icon, Caleb Perriton and Toby Brusseau lost a friend. Perriton relishes the memory of a class trip to Wyoming\u2019s Medicine Bow National Forest, a casual trip that Combs turned into a race. The photograph of Combs and his eldest daughter is now one of his prized possessions. Finding the right speaker to motivate incoming freshmen will be harder than it was when Jessi was around.</p> <p>Brusseau digs for the perfect story to encapsulate Combs\u2019s personality, but only finds memories of their last dinner together. It was a simple gathering of friends; conversations were dominated by life since their youth, the goings on of old classmates and Jessi\u2019s excitement about repurposing an old building to open a business in California. When he feels like he\u2019s talked too much to promote his documentary, he\u2019ll think of the girl in the welding mask who valued finishing a job before talking about it.</p> <p>Ultimately, he\u2019ll take solace in the fact that she died following her passion while lamenting the loss of a life that was just beginning.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I last saw her, I didn\u2019t see a celebrity. All I saw across was a friend sharing green curry, bullshitting about the past and life in general,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just gave each other a hug, said goodbye and waited for the next time we can catch up. You\u2019re never prepared for when it ends.\u201d</p>",

Combs spoke reverently of her liberated, rural upbringing that could feature rock climbing one day, cliff jumping on another and four-wheel racing on the weekends. \u201cSouth Dakota was a place where you could take risks,\u201d Combs said in a 2014 interview with MidCo Sports Network. \u201cYou could break barriers and get away with it.\u201d To high school classmate Greta Holzwarth, she was the fellow Stevens High School cheerleader with the most spirit in uniform and that \u201cbig, shitty grin\u201d of the first person to try something that her teammates wouldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m guessing cheerleader isn\u2019t what people expect when discussing the fastest woman on four wheels,\u201d Holzwarth says. When Combs graduated from Stevens High, she immersed herself in a world of mechanics and engineering at WyoTech, a Laramie, Wyoming-based institute for careers in the automotive and diesel industry. Combs was the unlikely celebrity from WyoTech, though fame never kept her from returning to a campus of blue-collar kids pursuing blue-collar vocations. She\u2019d remind incoming freshmen that she arrived in Laramie hundreds of miles from home. Was anybody in the audience afraid of denials from the financial aid office? A few years ago, Jessi Combs was too. Did any women in the audience feel scared to pursue the male-dominated world of metal fabricating? It wasn\u2019t long ago that the Fastest Woman on Four Wheels did too. \u201cThe last time she was on campus, there were a handful of female students seeking her advice,\u201d Perriton says. \u201cThey\u2019d mention anecdotally that that was why she came to the school. She set the trend for women in a male-dominated industry. And that isn\u2019t really debatable. She proved personal ambition, work ethic and so forth can guide anybody and she broke down a lot of barriers.\u201d After graduating at the top of her class, she was hired by the marketing department to build a car for showcase at a major trade show. Before long, she\u2019d make the seamless transition into television while conquering the racing circuit. Combs was showcased as a student during a Season One episode of the TLC show Overhaulin\u2019, a show she\u2019d eventually co-host after her involvement with Xtreme 4x4, All Girls Garage and the wildly popular Discovery channel show Mythbusters. Her growing celebrity didn\u2019t interrupt her active participation on the racing circuit, where she drove everything from monster trucks to rally cars to hot rods. If somebody needed a stunt driver, an off-roader or a drifter, Combs could do it. If the vehicle had a mechanical problem, she was equipped to fix it. \u201cIf you need to know anything about Jessi, it was that she was the real deal,\u201d says Jim Ryan, the sales and marketing director of the off-road racing body Score International. \u201cShe knew everything from the inside out and make repairs in the field. She wasn\u2019t somebody simply trying to achieve something. Whatever she was involved in, she respected.\u201d Whether it was racing the notoriously grueling Baja 100 \u2013 Score International\u2019s signature race in Baja, California, that spans over 800 miles \u2013 or trying to break land speed records, Combs\u2019s zest for new challenges throughout racing garnered universal respect from her peers. \u201cI want to be in the Guinness Book of World Records,\u201d Combs said in her 2014 interview with MidCo. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have the patience to grow the longest fingernails in the world. Why not be the fastest woman on four wheels? It makes complete sense.\u201d In that interview, Combs admitted that she thought she\u2019d return to Rapid City to build motorcycles for a living after college. Instead, she became the woman who could build a car or motorcycle from the ground up and race it to victory. To a generation of women aspiring to compete in motorsports or pursue metal fabrication and auto detailing, Combs was an icon. Her influence even inspired Valerie Thompson, a seven-time motorcycle land-speed record holder. The two led Combs\u2019s beloved Sturgis rally and formed a kinship as two women atop their respective fields. When Thompson crashed in March 2018 after reaching 363mph, Combs visited to ask how she was recovering physically and emotionally. \u201cShe could see when I was trying to be a big girl and when I wasn\u2019t being authentic,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cI realised that not many women ever get to experience what we do. We live life fearlessly. Her legacy will live on and it will live through mostly people she\u2019s never met. She was a proven example of what women can do.\u201d Thompson was outfitted for the North American Eagle, the car Combs was navigating at the time of her death. As the investigation continues to reveal what caused Combs\u2019s crash, her family, boyfriend Terry Madden and racing team are struggling to convey what they\u2019ve lost in the tragedy\u2019s aftermath. Madden, a member of Combs\u2019s team, shared a heartfelt message detailing the crash on Wednesday. Thompson is due to attend Speed Week at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in September, but admits to furiously refreshing her computer to learn more details about the accident. \u201cWhen I know what happened, I can let my heart rest,\u201d Thomspon says. \u201cI haven\u2019t recovered from my own accident and I was a former pilot for this car. I started that car and turned on the afterburners even if I didn\u2019t race it.\u201d While the motor sports community lost an icon, Caleb Perriton and Toby Brusseau lost a friend. Perriton relishes the memory of a class trip to Wyoming\u2019s Medicine Bow National Forest, a casual trip that Combs turned into a race. The photograph of Combs and his eldest daughter is now one of his prized possessions. Finding the right speaker to motivate incoming freshmen will be harder than it was when Jessi was around. Brusseau digs for the perfect story to encapsulate Combs\u2019s personality, but only finds memories of their last dinner together. It was a simple gathering of friends; conversations were dominated by life since their youth, the goings on of old classmates and Jessi\u2019s excitement about repurposing an old building to open a business in California. When he feels like he\u2019s talked too much to promote his documentary, he\u2019ll think of the girl in the welding mask who valued finishing a job before talking about it. Ultimately, he\u2019ll take solace in the fact that she died following her passion while lamenting the loss of a life that was just beginning. \u201cWhen I last saw her, I didn\u2019t see a celebrity. All I saw across was a friend sharing green curry, bullshitting about the past and life in general,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just gave each other a hug, said goodbye and waited for the next time we can catch up. You\u2019re never prepared for when it ends.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>What was the first thing you ate this morning? Was it a sit-down breakfast \u2013 toast or a bowl of cereal eaten with your family? Or was it a protein bar, possibly an almond and spirulina nut ball grabbed on the run? Increasingly, it is likely to be the latter; according to The Grocer magazine, 30% of adults in the UK say they <a href=\"https://harris-interactive.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/09/HI_UK_FMCG_Grocer-report-bagged-snacks-February.pdf\" title=\"\">skip at least one meal a day</a> in favour of snacking.</p> <p>Elaine Malone, 28, a graphic designer based in London, tells me she \u201chardly ever\u201d has breakfast. \u201cI\u2019m never very hungry at that time, and it saves me about 30 or 40 minutes a day by skipping it.\u201d She might buy a protein bar on the way into her office or, more usually, she reaches into a secret stash of snacks once at her desk. \u201cIn my drawer I have a whole selection of Graze boxes, which I get delivered to work every two weeks.\u201d Graze, launched just over a decade ago, is a subscription service that delivers its customers a snack selection taken from 200 different products \u2013 each package thin enough to be pushed through a letter box. \u201cI love all their stuff \u2013 their fruity flapjacks, their Pro Bean box [a selection of dried edamame, broad beans and peanuts]. It\u2019s just nice to have something healthy to hand when you are feeling hungry. It\u2019s much better than a bag of crisps,\u201d says Malone, who works for a company that hosts podcasts and events for Instagram and YouTube influencers. This year, Graze was sold for an estimated \u00a3150m to Unilever, the Marmite and Hellmann\u2019s food conglomerate, a sign that Malone\u2019s snack obsession has become very big business. \u201cWe\u2019re all big snackers in this office,\u201d she says, adding that dark chocolate rice cakes are a key afternoon regular among the mostly millennial-aged workers.</p> <p>Britain has undergone many food revolutions over the last generation; olive oil has moved from pharmacist\u2019s shelf to store-cupboard staple; we\u2019ve seen a boom in gin, and an even bigger one in veganism. But there is one that has gone less remarked \u2013 what Praveen Vijh calls \u201cthe snackification of Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Vijh is co-founder of Eat Natural, the cereal bar company that has surfed the snack wave as effectively as Graze. We meet in its head office in Halstead, Essex, above a factory where 250 workers churn out 2m cereal bars every week, in a remarkably low-tech operation involving rolling pins and hundreds of baking trays. A former rice importer, Vijh moved into cleaning and packing dried fruit and nuts before asking himself, \u201cWhy not just stick all these fruits and nuts together?\u201d In 1996, he developed a cereal bar with a university friend, at a time when \u201cour only real rivals were the Tracker bar and the Cadbury brunch bar\u201d. Since then, sales have climbed about 15% a year, hitting \u00a345m in 2018. But last year, sales rose only 5%. Why? \u201cBrands and supermarkets don\u2019t want to be portrayed as purveyors of salt, sugar and fat. All these big boys are starting to get very worried, and there has been a plethora of new entrants. Everyone wants to get into snacking.\u201d</p> <p>Vijh is 52 and grew up in Solihull during the era of Monster Munch and Wagon Wheels, both launched in the late 1970s. \u201cThere was very little snacking,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might have half a Twix. Snacking was a big treat.\u201d Official figures bear this out. In 1977, the year Monster Munch was launched, the average adult in Britain consumed 29g of crisps, nuts, seeds, popcorn or savoury snacks each week, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) figures. That\u2019s less than a bag of crisps. Fast-forward to 2015, the most recent year for which we have such detailed data, and the figure is 89g, the equivalent of very nearly three bags of crisps. In the space of a generation, we have tripled our consumption of snacks \u2013 if not more: Defra\u2019s figures do not include the myriad of other products now sold in the snack aisles, from cashew quinoa bars at Aldi to Itsu crispy seaweed thins at Waitrose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9960e05a24260951dcd8587feccf7f0dc7e2edc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9960e05a24260951dcd8587feccf7f0dc7e2edc6/0_605_7226_4336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pop corn in a bowl with spoon next to it, on green background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Consumers are leaving home earlier. Peak snacking time is now from 6.30am.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The size of the snacking market in Britain is hard to pin down, because all the market research companies and retailers measure it in different ways: do you include confectionery, an apple grabbed from a sandwich shop, or only savoury snacks? \u201cSnacking is unlimited. You have one breakfast, one lunch and one dinner in a day. Maximum. But you could have as many snacks as you like,\u201d says Katie Shade, consumer insight director at Kantar, a market research firm which estimates that snack sales \u2013 using a very wide definition \u2013 reached \u00a311.1bn in the year to June 2019, up 4% on the previous 12 months. \u201cIn the UK we love snacking \u2013 we snack more than most other countries.\u201d Her company estimates that British people snack 8.3 times a week, compared with 3.8 times in France and 3.1 times in China.</p> <p>But if no one can agree on the size of the market, they can agree that there is one area growing faster than all others: healthy snacking. Kantar calculates that what it terms \u201cbetter for you\u201d crisps and snacks shot up 20% last year. This includes everything from Hippeas, a brand of chickpea puffs (tagline: \u201cWe think \u2018tastes good\u2019 and \u2018do good\u2019 can be in the same sentence\u201d) to Walkers, Britain\u2019s biggest snack company, whose oven-baked potato crisps claim to contain 50% less fat than the standard variety.</p> <p>When did snacking become not only part of our everyday diet, but a fiercely fought battleground for supermarkets and food brands desperate to persuade us that their product can do us good? Even Cathedral City, Britain\u2019s biggest cheese brand, has started packaging its product in 100-calorie \u201csnack bars\u201d. In reality, this is no more than a small slice of cheese, but one that the company describes on the pack as \u201chigh in protein, an ideal snack for on-the-go\u201d, sold in Shell petrol stations alongside fizzy drinks.</p> <p>At Eat Natural, Vijh argues that one thing above all others is driving this trend: we are working longer and harder than ever before. That means many consumers, such as Malone, are missing meals, especially breakfast. \u201cConsumers are leaving home earlier in the morning. This is not only in London, this is also in Nottingham, this is also in Birmingham \u2013 everywhere that we can see it\u2019s absolutely on the increase,\u201d he says, explaining that he receives data from every WHSmith, supermarket and railway station shop detailing the time of day people buy an Eat Natural bar. He says a decade ago the peak time was 11am. \u201cIt is now from seven or even 6.30 in the morning. That\u2019s the biggest trend I\u2019ve seen over the last 10 years.\u201d</p> <p>The slow demise of the nuclear family has also played a part. \u201cLiving in individual, smaller-person households has meant we\u2019re not sitting down to eat as a family as much,\u201d Vijh says. Malone shares a house with four other people and says that though they may not all sit down to share a meal together, they do snack together. \u201cIn the evening when I come home from work, my flatmates and I will often sit and watch TV with a large pack of tortilla chips or popcorn.\u201d While her snacking at work is strictly healthy, in the evening it\u2019s not. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have any snacks in the house, it\u2019s a crisis and someone has to go out and buy some.\u201d Malone and her flatmates are precisely the people the big brands are trying to attract: health-conscious, but willing to indulge.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only Unilever, with its purchase of Graze, that wants a slice of this. The past two years have seen a spike in snacking acquisitions: Kellogg\u2019s bought the American protein bar company RXBar for $600m (\u00a3483m); PepsiCo, the parent company of Walkers, spent $200m buying Bare Snacks, which specialises in banana chips, as part of its mission to \u201cmake more nutritious products\u201d; and Mars, the confectionery giant, took a large stake in Kind, the cereal bar company, valuing the latter at $4bn. Mars said the Kind acquisition would help anchor \u201ca newly formed global health and wellness platform\u201d.</p> <p>And this is only the food giants; there are tons of smaller startups trying to muscle in on the market. According to Nielsen, the market research company, an eye-popping 1,780 different snacking products were launched on to Britain\u2019s shop shelves last year \u2013 everything from sweet chilli black-eyed pea puffs to oven-baked spelt bites and salted caramel beans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Olives in an on-the-go format means you can have a slightly indulgent, grown-up snack in your bag</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One supermarket, in particular, has encouraged this snack explosion: Sainsbury\u2019s. Like all of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets, it is under intense pressure from the two German discount chains, Aldi and Lidl, which have chipped away at its market share. Its failed attempt to merge with Asda has left it scrabbling around for a convincing approach. One answer is snacking \u2013 specifically, offering customers a large number of unusual treats. \u201cOur strategy is to give more reasons for customers to choose us,\u201d explains Rachel Eyre, head of Future Brands at Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cAnd one of the ways we want to do that is by offering innovative, exciting brands that you can\u2019t find in other supermarkets.\u201d In return for putting these small, start-up labels on a prominent \u201cTaste of the Future\u201d shelf, these brands commit to supplying only Sainsbury\u2019s for an agreed period of time.</p> <p>Eyre is interested in everything from kombucha to craft gin, but focused on snacks. \u201cAdult snacking in particular is very competitive. That\u2019s because it sits at the intersection of this spaghetti junction of consumer trends, which means there is a huge amount of entrepreneurial heat,\u201d Eyre says. The roads meeting in her junction metaphor are: our \u201cbusier on-the-go\u201d lifestyles, and the joint rise of an interest in health and \u201cpremiumisation\u201d, the phenomenon whereby consumers are occasionally willing to splash out on upmarket products. She adds: \u201cI think of it as credits and debits: consumers are looking to make healthier and more considered choices. That means when they do indulge, they want to do so properly.\u201d</p> <p>Some of Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cfuture\u201d snacks are far from radical. One is Olly\u2019s Olives, which claims to be the \u201cworld\u2019s first unpasteurised snack pouch of olives\u201d, costing \u00a31 for 50g in a small pouch \u2013 a 60% mark-up on olives in a plastic tub. \u201cOlives, of course, aren\u2019t new,\u201d admits Eyre. \u201cBut the very simple idea of putting them in an on-the-go format means you can have a slightly indulgent, grown-up snack in your bag rather than a bag of crisps.\u201d</p> <p>Others are more outre, such as Sea Chips, \u201chand-crafted salmon skin crisps\u201d, which boasts on the front of the pack of being \u201chigh in omega 3\u201d and \u201c62% protein\u201d. On the back, the company explains that, along with donating some profits to charity, it is saving \u201ctonnes of highly nutritious skin from going to waste\u201d. The crisps are surprisingly tasty \u2013 a puffy, light snack with enough salt and vinegar to make your lips tingle. Even my 11-year-old daughter, whose most hated food is fish, judges them quite moreish.</p> <p>A prominent protein count written on the front, combined with a message about the company either transforming you \u2013 or the world \u2013 into something better, has become a key strategy in the healthy snack market. And it works, according to Eyre. In a bid to understand its customers\u2019 emotional reaction to marketing or packaging, Sainsbury\u2019s has recruited volunteers and rigged them up with heart scanners, sweat detection monitors and even eye-tracking headsets, observing them as they wander through the aisles. \u201cWe know where they are engaged around the stores, and that they are drawn to these stories,\u201d she says. \u201cThese messages definitely resonate and, crucially, they go on to put those items in their basket.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81f18f4a28c3b64b7922e980cd0b43a00b4ef904\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81f18f4a28c3b64b7922e980cd0b43a00b4ef904/0_3049_5090_3054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protein ball on yellow surface, speared by fork against blue background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Protein, in the consumer\u2019s mind, helps fill you up \u2013 important if there\u2019s a missed lunch.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One such brand is Yaar, which calls itself a \u201cNordic quark bar\u201d, though it is made in Estonia by a Ukrainian who went to boarding school in England and then became a pharmaceutical entrepreneur in Singapore. Andrei Garbuz, 37, says the business of selling painkillers and selling snacks is very similar. \u201cI saw a huge trend: the convergence of healthcare and food businesses. So I decided that if I was to start a new business, it would be a food business with a tilt into health. It\u2019s a huge opportunity. Humanity is going back to Ayurveda \u2013 eating better for your health.\u201d</p> <p>Quark is a fermented high-protein dairy product similar to yoghurt or cream cheese. The problem is that it is nearly always eaten out of a pot \u2013 so Garbuz has coated his quark in chocolate to make it an \u201con-the-go, no-spooning snack format\u201d, available from the chiller cabinet. I found them a bit sickly, like a rich mini-cheesecake, but I can see that for those with a very sweet tooth they might be a treat that, at 140 cals, doesn\u2019t blow the daily calorie count. Garbuz argues that \u201cno-spooning is a radical concept\u201d, delivering nutrients \u201cin a permissible dosage\u201d.</p> <p>His use of medical terminology is not an accident. Increasingly, snacks have become meal replacements and consumers do not want to have to scan the nutrient smallprint on the back; they want just a simple message on the front. And where once it was calories, it is protein that has become the most appealing shorthand for healthy. According to Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze: \u201cConsumers are willing to pay far more for high-protein snacks. It started in the fitness community, people who went to the gym and were interested in building muscle. But now it\u2019s far more about feeling full. Protein, in the consumer\u2019s mind, helps fill you up, so you can eat a high- protein snack and it satiates. That\u2019s important if there\u2019s a missed lunch.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s all about good ingredients, and under 100 calories is what a customer will aim for if they are trying to be healthy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Where snacking used to be an impulse purchase, grabbed at the till, it is now planned. Fletcher says 60% of Graze\u2019s sales are bought in advance, especially by women. \u201cFemale consumers are more interested in where their protein is coming from \u2013 am I getting that protein in a natural way, or is it a synthetic product?\u201d His bestselling product is Veggie Protein Power, a 28g box with edamame beans, chickpeas and cashews, containing 7.3g of protein.</p> <p>The protein fad helps explain the surprising rise of meat snacks; while they may be high in salt or fat, they are very high in protein and so, according to Rosie While, product developer at Marks &amp; Spencer, represent \u201cpositive snacking\u201d. While developed a new range of serrano ham, chorizo and salami crisps for this summer \u2013 not potato crisps, but actual slices of meat, air-dried and crunchy. While says the trend for air-drying has been particularly embraced by millennials, in contrast to their parents\u2019 generation, who were more keen on calorie-counting. \u201cIt\u2019s all about good ingredients, rather than bad ingredients that are being controlled by a certain calorie limit.\u201d Still, she admits that the serrano ham crisp (99 calories a pack) is significantly outselling the chorizo and salami (130 calories). While points to 100 calories as the magic number many people still look for. \u201cWe do know that anything under 100 calories is something a customer will aim for if they are trying to be healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Now that protein has gone mainstream, the next big trend is fibre. Vijh at Eat Natural argues that consumers are increasingly interested in gut health, as well as the growing number of studies that have associated diets high in fibre with a lower incidence of heart disease. \u201cFibre isn\u2019t very sexy, but we know that people aren\u2019t consuming enough of it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing new \u2013 my parents used to give us prunes for breakfast.\u201d Graze now has a large number of snack boxes flagged as high in fibre, while even Walkers has launched a premium range of snacks (dried vegetable and nut mixes, pea and bean sticks) called Off The Eaten Path, some of which highlight fibre content.</p> <p>Vijh first experimented with a fibre bar a couple of years ago, and got it wrong. \u201cWe called the bar Better Inside, and did it a bit artificially using chicory root fibre,\u201d a tasteless substance that Vijh admits had the texture of talcum powder. \u201cThat made the product taste a little bit weird, to be quite honest \u2013 just dry and powdery.\u201d This summer he tried again, with a dark chocolate and sea salt bar called Fibre Packed, using figs as the main source of fibre. Is it still weird? \u201cNo, it\u2019s delicious,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have an aversion to highly processed ingredients. They want ingredients they recognise.\u201d</p> <p>We finish our tour of the factory and head up to Vijh\u2019s office, where his desk is surrounded by boxes of cereal bars and jars of ingredients that his developers are experimenting with (tomato powder and rice syrup, hinting at the Willy Wonka-ish possibility of a savoury cereal bar). I ask Vijh if he\u2019s excited by the \u201csnackification\u201d of Britain, expecting an enthusiastic response. But he answers rather wistfully: \u201cActually, I would love to go back to the days where we used to all sit down together and eat meals as a family. I hope we don\u2019t become a nation where we eat nothing but snacks.\u201d</p> <p>But as the market intensifies, a return to the era of three square meals looks unlikely. I ask Malone if she could cope without her hit of Graze protein bites at work, or popcorn in the evening? \u201cGood god! I am such a snacker. It\u2019s something I do every day.\u201d She laughs. \u201cWhat would I do with my hands?\u201d</p> <h2>Landmarks in modern snacking</h2> <p><strong>2004</strong><br>After decades of rectangular flapjacks and cereal bars, Bounce introduces the world to the spherical protein hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2e59e2e70f01b4f51ab3ad76074e4c3bf78554c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e59e2e70f01b4f51ab3ad76074e4c3bf78554c0/378_1839_2622_2139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trail mix of nuts and dried fruit isolated on white background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"816\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In at the start: nuts and dried fruit.

      "bodyText": "What was the first thing you ate this morning? Was it a sit-down breakfast \u2013 toast or a bowl of cereal eaten with your family? Or was it a protein bar, possibly an almond and spirulina nut ball grabbed on the run? Increasingly, it is likely to be the latter; according to The Grocer magazine, 30% of adults in the UK say they skip at least one meal a day in favour of snacking. Elaine Malone, 28, a graphic designer based in London, tells me she \u201chardly ever\u201d has breakfast. \u201cI\u2019m never very hungry at that time, and it saves me about 30 or 40 minutes a day by skipping it.\u201d She might buy a protein bar on the way into her office or, more usually, she reaches into a secret stash of snacks once at her desk. \u201cIn my drawer I have a whole selection of Graze boxes, which I get delivered to work every two weeks.\u201d Graze, launched just over a decade ago, is a subscription service that delivers its customers a snack selection taken from 200 different products \u2013 each package thin enough to be pushed through a letter box. \u201cI love all their stuff \u2013 their fruity flapjacks, their Pro Bean box [a selection of dried edamame, broad beans and peanuts]. It\u2019s just nice to have something healthy to hand when you are feeling hungry. It\u2019s much better than a bag of crisps,\u201d says Malone, who works for a company that hosts podcasts and events for Instagram and YouTube influencers. This year, Graze was sold for an estimated \u00a3150m to Unilever, the Marmite and Hellmann\u2019s food conglomerate, a sign that Malone\u2019s snack obsession has become very big business. \u201cWe\u2019re all big snackers in this office,\u201d she says, adding that dark chocolate rice cakes are a key afternoon regular among the mostly millennial-aged workers. Britain has undergone many food revolutions over the last generation; olive oil has moved from pharmacist\u2019s shelf to store-cupboard staple; we\u2019ve seen a boom in gin, and an even bigger one in veganism. But there is one that has gone less remarked \u2013 what Praveen Vijh calls \u201cthe snackification of Britain\u201d. Vijh is co-founder of Eat Natural, the cereal bar company that has surfed the snack wave as effectively as Graze. We meet in its head office in Halstead, Essex, above a factory where 250 workers churn out 2m cereal bars every week, in a remarkably low-tech operation involving rolling pins and hundreds of baking trays. A former rice importer, Vijh moved into cleaning and packing dried fruit and nuts before asking himself, \u201cWhy not just stick all these fruits and nuts together?\u201d In 1996, he developed a cereal bar with a university friend, at a time when \u201cour only real rivals were the Tracker bar and the Cadbury brunch bar\u201d. Since then, sales have climbed about 15% a year, hitting \u00a345m in 2018. But last year, sales rose only 5%. Why? \u201cBrands and supermarkets don\u2019t want to be portrayed as purveyors of salt, sugar and fat. All these big boys are starting to get very worried, and there has been a plethora of new entrants. Everyone wants to get into snacking.\u201d Vijh is 52 and grew up in Solihull during the era of Monster Munch and Wagon Wheels, both launched in the late 1970s. \u201cThere was very little snacking,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might have half a Twix. Snacking was a big treat.\u201d Official figures bear this out. In 1977, the year Monster Munch was launched, the average adult in Britain consumed 29g of crisps, nuts, seeds, popcorn or savoury snacks each week, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) figures. That\u2019s less than a bag of crisps. Fast-forward to 2015, the most recent year for which we have such detailed data, and the figure is 89g, the equivalent of very nearly three bags of crisps. In the space of a generation, we have tripled our consumption of snacks \u2013 if not more: Defra\u2019s figures do not include the myriad of other products now sold in the snack aisles, from cashew quinoa bars at Aldi to Itsu crispy seaweed thins at Waitrose. The size of the snacking market in Britain is hard to pin down, because all the market research companies and retailers measure it in different ways: do you include confectionery, an apple grabbed from a sandwich shop, or only savoury snacks? \u201cSnacking is unlimited. You have one breakfast, one lunch and one dinner in a day. Maximum. But you could have as many snacks as you like,\u201d says Katie Shade, consumer insight director at Kantar, a market research firm which estimates that snack sales \u2013 using a very wide definition \u2013 reached \u00a311.1bn in the year to June 2019, up 4% on the previous 12 months. \u201cIn the UK we love snacking \u2013 we snack more than most other countries.\u201d Her company estimates that British people snack 8.3 times a week, compared with 3.8 times in France and 3.1 times in China. But if no one can agree on the size of the market, they can agree that there is one area growing faster than all others: healthy snacking. Kantar calculates that what it terms \u201cbetter for you\u201d crisps and snacks shot up 20% last year. This includes everything from Hippeas, a brand of chickpea puffs (tagline: \u201cWe think \u2018tastes good\u2019 and \u2018do good\u2019 can be in the same sentence\u201d) to Walkers, Britain\u2019s biggest snack company, whose oven-baked potato crisps claim to contain 50% less fat than the standard variety. When did snacking become not only part of our everyday diet, but a fiercely fought battleground for supermarkets and food brands desperate to persuade us that their product can do us good? Even Cathedral City, Britain\u2019s biggest cheese brand, has started packaging its product in 100-calorie \u201csnack bars\u201d. In reality, this is no more than a small slice of cheese, but one that the company describes on the pack as \u201chigh in protein, an ideal snack for on-the-go\u201d, sold in Shell petrol stations alongside fizzy drinks. At Eat Natural, Vijh argues that one thing above all others is driving this trend: we are working longer and harder than ever before. That means many consumers, such as Malone, are missing meals, especially breakfast. \u201cConsumers are leaving home earlier in the morning. This is not only in London, this is also in Nottingham, this is also in Birmingham \u2013 everywhere that we can see it\u2019s absolutely on the increase,\u201d he says, explaining that he receives data from every WHSmith, supermarket and railway station shop detailing the time of day people buy an Eat Natural bar. He says a decade ago the peak time was 11am. \u201cIt is now from seven or even 6.30 in the morning. That\u2019s the biggest trend I\u2019ve seen over the last 10 years.\u201d The slow demise of the nuclear family has also played a part. \u201cLiving in individual, smaller-person households has meant we\u2019re not sitting down to eat as a family as much,\u201d Vijh says. Malone shares a house with four other people and says that though they may not all sit down to share a meal together, they do snack together. \u201cIn the evening when I come home from work, my flatmates and I will often sit and watch TV with a large pack of tortilla chips or popcorn.\u201d While her snacking at work is strictly healthy, in the evening it\u2019s not. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have any snacks in the house, it\u2019s a crisis and someone has to go out and buy some.\u201d Malone and her flatmates are precisely the people the big brands are trying to attract: health-conscious, but willing to indulge. It\u2019s not only Unilever, with its purchase of Graze, that wants a slice of this. The past two years have seen a spike in snacking acquisitions: Kellogg\u2019s bought the American protein bar company RXBar for $600m (\u00a3483m); PepsiCo, the parent company of Walkers, spent $200m buying Bare Snacks, which specialises in banana chips, as part of its mission to \u201cmake more nutritious products\u201d; and Mars, the confectionery giant, took a large stake in Kind, the cereal bar company, valuing the latter at $4bn. Mars said the Kind acquisition would help anchor \u201ca newly formed global health and wellness platform\u201d. And this is only the food giants; there are tons of smaller startups trying to muscle in on the market. According to Nielsen, the market research company, an eye-popping 1,780 different snacking products were launched on to Britain\u2019s shop shelves last year \u2013 everything from sweet chilli black-eyed pea puffs to oven-baked spelt bites and salted caramel beans. One supermarket, in particular, has encouraged this snack explosion: Sainsbury\u2019s. Like all of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets, it is under intense pressure from the two German discount chains, Aldi and Lidl, which have chipped away at its market share. Its failed attempt to merge with Asda has left it scrabbling around for a convincing approach. One answer is snacking \u2013 specifically, offering customers a large number of unusual treats. \u201cOur strategy is to give more reasons for customers to choose us,\u201d explains Rachel Eyre, head of Future Brands at Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cAnd one of the ways we want to do that is by offering innovative, exciting brands that you can\u2019t find in other supermarkets.\u201d In return for putting these small, start-up labels on a prominent \u201cTaste of the Future\u201d shelf, these brands commit to supplying only Sainsbury\u2019s for an agreed period of time. Eyre is interested in everything from kombucha to craft gin, but focused on snacks. \u201cAdult snacking in particular is very competitive. That\u2019s because it sits at the intersection of this spaghetti junction of consumer trends, which means there is a huge amount of entrepreneurial heat,\u201d Eyre says. The roads meeting in her junction metaphor are: our \u201cbusier on-the-go\u201d lifestyles, and the joint rise of an interest in health and \u201cpremiumisation\u201d, the phenomenon whereby consumers are occasionally willing to splash out on upmarket products. She adds: \u201cI think of it as credits and debits: consumers are looking to make healthier and more considered choices. That means when they do indulge, they want to do so properly.\u201d Some of Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cfuture\u201d snacks are far from radical. One is Olly\u2019s Olives, which claims to be the \u201cworld\u2019s first unpasteurised snack pouch of olives\u201d, costing \u00a31 for 50g in a small pouch \u2013 a 60% mark-up on olives in a plastic tub. \u201cOlives, of course, aren\u2019t new,\u201d admits Eyre. \u201cBut the very simple idea of putting them in an on-the-go format means you can have a slightly indulgent, grown-up snack in your bag rather than a bag of crisps.\u201d Others are more outre, such as Sea Chips, \u201chand-crafted salmon skin crisps\u201d, which boasts on the front of the pack of being \u201chigh in omega 3\u201d and \u201c62% protein\u201d. On the back, the company explains that, along with donating some profits to charity, it is saving \u201ctonnes of highly nutritious skin from going to waste\u201d. The crisps are surprisingly tasty \u2013 a puffy, light snack with enough salt and vinegar to make your lips tingle. Even my 11-year-old daughter, whose most hated food is fish, judges them quite moreish. A prominent protein count written on the front, combined with a message about the company either transforming you \u2013 or the world \u2013 into something better, has become a key strategy in the healthy snack market. And it works, according to Eyre. In a bid to understand its customers\u2019 emotional reaction to marketing or packaging, Sainsbury\u2019s has recruited volunteers and rigged them up with heart scanners, sweat detection monitors and even eye-tracking headsets, observing them as they wander through the aisles. \u201cWe know where they are engaged around the stores, and that they are drawn to these stories,\u201d she says. \u201cThese messages definitely resonate and, crucially, they go on to put those items in their basket.\u201d One such brand is Yaar, which calls itself a \u201cNordic quark bar\u201d, though it is made in Estonia by a Ukrainian who went to boarding school in England and then became a pharmaceutical entrepreneur in Singapore. Andrei Garbuz, 37, says the business of selling painkillers and selling snacks is very similar. \u201cI saw a huge trend: the convergence of healthcare and food businesses. So I decided that if I was to start a new business, it would be a food business with a tilt into health. It\u2019s a huge opportunity. Humanity is going back to Ayurveda \u2013 eating better for your health.\u201d Quark is a fermented high-protein dairy product similar to yoghurt or cream cheese. The problem is that it is nearly always eaten out of a pot \u2013 so Garbuz has coated his quark in chocolate to make it an \u201con-the-go, no-spooning snack format\u201d, available from the chiller cabinet. I found them a bit sickly, like a rich mini-cheesecake, but I can see that for those with a very sweet tooth they might be a treat that, at 140 cals, doesn\u2019t blow the daily calorie count. Garbuz argues that \u201cno-spooning is a radical concept\u201d, delivering nutrients \u201cin a permissible dosage\u201d. His use of medical terminology is not an accident. Increasingly, snacks have become meal replacements and consumers do not want to have to scan the nutrient smallprint on the back; they want just a simple message on the front. And where once it was calories, it is protein that has become the most appealing shorthand for healthy. According to Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze: \u201cConsumers are willing to pay far more for high-protein snacks. It started in the fitness community, people who went to the gym and were interested in building muscle. But now it\u2019s far more about feeling full. Protein, in the consumer\u2019s mind, helps fill you up, so you can eat a high- protein snack and it satiates. That\u2019s important if there\u2019s a missed lunch.\u201d Where snacking used to be an impulse purchase, grabbed at the till, it is now planned. Fletcher says 60% of Graze\u2019s sales are bought in advance, especially by women. \u201cFemale consumers are more interested in where their protein is coming from \u2013 am I getting that protein in a natural way, or is it a synthetic product?\u201d His bestselling product is Veggie Protein Power, a 28g box with edamame beans, chickpeas and cashews, containing 7.3g of protein. The protein fad helps explain the surprising rise of meat snacks; while they may be high in salt or fat, they are very high in protein and so, according to Rosie While, product developer at Marks &amp; Spencer, represent \u201cpositive snacking\u201d. While developed a new range of serrano ham, chorizo and salami crisps for this summer \u2013 not potato crisps, but actual slices of meat, air-dried and crunchy. While says the trend for air-drying has been particularly embraced by millennials, in contrast to their parents\u2019 generation, who were more keen on calorie-counting. \u201cIt\u2019s all about good ingredients, rather than bad ingredients that are being controlled by a certain calorie limit.\u201d Still, she admits that the serrano ham crisp (99 calories a pack) is significantly outselling the chorizo and salami (130 calories). While points to 100 calories as the magic number many people still look for. \u201cWe do know that anything under 100 calories is something a customer will aim for if they are trying to be healthy.\u201d Now that protein has gone mainstream, the next big trend is fibre. Vijh at Eat Natural argues that consumers are increasingly interested in gut health, as well as the growing number of studies that have associated diets high in fibre with a lower incidence of heart disease. \u201cFibre isn\u2019t very sexy, but we know that people aren\u2019t consuming enough of it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing new \u2013 my parents used to give us prunes for breakfast.\u201d Graze now has a large number of snack boxes flagged as high in fibre, while even Walkers has launched a premium range of snacks (dried vegetable and nut mixes, pea and bean sticks) called Off The Eaten Path, some of which highlight fibre content. Vijh first experimented with a fibre bar a couple of years ago, and got it wrong. \u201cWe called the bar Better Inside, and did it a bit artificially using chicory root fibre,\u201d a tasteless substance that Vijh admits had the texture of talcum powder. \u201cThat made the product taste a little bit weird, to be quite honest \u2013 just dry and powdery.\u201d This summer he tried again, with a dark chocolate and sea salt bar called Fibre Packed, using figs as the main source of fibre. Is it still weird? \u201cNo, it\u2019s delicious,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have an aversion to highly processed ingredients. They want ingredients they recognise.\u201d We finish our tour of the factory and head up to Vijh\u2019s office, where his desk is surrounded by boxes of cereal bars and jars of ingredients that his developers are experimenting with (tomato powder and rice syrup, hinting at the Willy Wonka-ish possibility of a savoury cereal bar). I ask Vijh if he\u2019s excited by the \u201csnackification\u201d of Britain, expecting an enthusiastic response. But he answers rather wistfully: \u201cActually, I would love to go back to the days where we used to all sit down together and eat meals as a family. I hope we don\u2019t become a nation where we eat nothing but snacks.\u201d But as the market intensifies, a return to the era of three square meals looks unlikely. I ask Malone if she could cope without her hit of Graze protein bites at work, or popcorn in the evening? \u201cGood god! I am such a snacker. It\u2019s something I do every day.\u201d She laughs. \u201cWhat would I do with my hands?\u201d Landmarks in modern snacking 2004 After decades of rectangular flapjacks and cereal bars, Bounce introduces the world to the spherical protein hit. 2008 Graham Bosher, a former executive at DVD subscription service LoveFilm, launches Graze, sending parcels of fresh fruit through the post. It moves into nuts and dried fruit after consumers complain about slices of pineapple sitting on their doormats. 2010 Joe &amp; Seph\u2019s, a gourmet popcorn brand inspired by Garrett Popcorn Shops in Chicago, launches in Selfridges. Sold in clear plastic pouches (to prove there are no unpopped kernels), its bestselling flavour is salted caramel, followed by goat\u2019s cheese. 2011 Mondelez, the giant American parent company of Cadbury, introduces BelVita into Britain, claiming it is \u201cthe UK\u2019s only specially designed breakfast biscuit\u201d. 2014 Lentil crisps become mainstream thanks to Cofresh, a leading Indian snack company based in the UK, starting the Eat Real brand, promising snacks that are gluten-free, vegan and free from all 14 declarable allergens. 2016 Walkers, Britain\u2019s biggest snack brand, introduces a new packaging format: Tear \u2019n\u2019 Share bags, which turn into a bowl, aimed at consumers who want to stay in, watch TV and \u201csnack socially\u201d. 2017 Prime bars, made from 80% British beef and mixed with either apricot and sage, or chilli and red pepper, are marketed at ultra-marathon runners or those on keto or paleo diets, kickstarting a boom in meat snacks. 2018 Popped lotus seeds, a popular snack in India and China, hits the UK market thanks to the Nuto brand. The market research company Mintel predicts they will become \u201cthe new popcorn\u201d. Many other brands have followed. 2019 Daniel Pawson, inventor of Sea Chips, crisps made from salmon skin, appears on the BBC\u2019s Dragons\u2019 Den. The company had sold 3,000 bags of the product. He turned down an offer of investment, but the publicity secured him a listing in Sainsbury\u2019s, and he now makes 10,000 packets a day. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Starting with a good, nonstick pan, he says, will relieve some of the need to have the temperature just right. Size also matters: \u201cMake sure you\u2019re not overcrowding the pan: fried eggs only take a few minutes to cook, so it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re cooking them one at a time.\u201d Few weekends are ruined by waiting an extra few minutes for brekkie.</p> <p>Kirby follows in his mother\u2019s footsteps and fries in oil, usually vegetable \u2013 sometimes rapeseed, but never olive \u2013 as favoured by the likes of Jamie Oliver. \u201cOlive oil has a flavour I don\u2019t particularly care for with my fried eggs.\u201d However, it\u2019s this flavour (and lower acidity) that makes olive oil a winner in Pizarro\u2019s book: \u201cI always, always use it: just a little, heated until smoking\u201d (note: cold whites hitting a not-hot-enough pan are going to stick).</p> <p>Whichever way you go, oil, Kirby advises, is the key to getting that crisp, brown base, whereas butter \u201ctends to steam the eggs a little because of the water content\u201d. Unsurprisingly, <a href=\"http://www.michelroux.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Michel Roux Jr</a>, chef patron at Le Gavroche and a Frenchman, hangs his hat on butter, heating \u201cuntil frothy\u201d before cracking in the egg. Feast\u2019s perfectionist<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/felicity-cloake\" title=\"\"> Felicity Cloake</a> is also Team Butter, instead adding the egg once it has melted \u201cbut not begun to foam\u201d. Cloake and Pizarro adopt a similar approach by basting the whites with the fat after a couple of minutes, avoiding even a mere splash on the yolk. Secret fat option number three comes from Delia Smith: bacon. However, as you\u2019re unlikely to be putting away enough rashers to have sufficient supplies of fat, we\u2019ll park this one here.</p> <p>As ever, if you keep your eggs in the fridge, let them come up to room temperature before cracking \u2013 starting with a cold egg, Cloake says, means you\u2019re more likely to overcook the yolk trying to get the white to set. Fresh eggs are best for frying as they\u2019re less likely to spread in the pan (the stronger the proteins in the white, the neater the shape) \u2013 but, Cloake suggests, if you\u2019re struggling to perfect those whites, a slightly older egg that spreads and therefore gives a thinner white could work to your frying advantage. Pizarro breaks his eggs into a bowl or cup first, before sliding into a hot pan where, on landing, it should sizzle and spit a little.</p> <p>A lid, just smaller than the pan, is also a trusted ally: \u201cWhen the bottom of the egg is cooked to your liking, put a lid on top, take it off the heat and the residual heat will cook the egg,\u201d says Kirby. Roux waits for the white to \u201cfrizzle\u201d before covering and turning off the heat and leaving for a minute, while Cloake covers and leaves on a low heat for three and a half minutes. Seasoning should then be done at the last minute.</p> <p>Some suggest crispy whites and soak-up-with-toast yolk success can be found in separating the eggs: frying the whites and adding the yolk in the last few minutes of cooking. This seems like a lot of faff, especially when there are much simpler ways to crack (sorry) this.</p> <p><em>Have you got a culinary dilemma?

Size also matters: \u201cMake sure you\u2019re not overcrowding the pan: fried eggs only take a few minutes to cook, so it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re cooking them one at a time.\u201d Few weekends are ruined by waiting an extra few minutes for brekkie. Kirby follows in his mother\u2019s footsteps and fries in oil, usually vegetable \u2013 sometimes rapeseed, but never olive \u2013 as favoured by the likes of Jamie Oliver. \u201cOlive oil has a flavour I don\u2019t particularly care for with my fried eggs.\u201d However, it\u2019s this flavour (and lower acidity) that makes olive oil a winner in Pizarro\u2019s book: \u201cI always, always use it: just a little, heated until smoking\u201d (note: cold whites hitting a not-hot-enough pan are going to stick). Whichever way you go, oil, Kirby advises, is the key to getting that crisp, brown base, whereas butter \u201ctends to steam the eggs a little because of the water content\u201d. Unsurprisingly, Michel Roux Jr, chef patron at Le Gavroche and a Frenchman, hangs his hat on butter, heating \u201cuntil frothy\u201d before cracking in the egg. Feast\u2019s perfectionist Felicity Cloake is also Team Butter, instead adding the egg once it has melted \u201cbut not begun to foam\u201d. Cloake and Pizarro adopt a similar approach by basting the whites with the fat after a couple of minutes, avoiding even a mere splash on the yolk. Secret fat option number three comes from Delia Smith: bacon. However, as you\u2019re unlikely to be putting away enough rashers to have sufficient supplies of fat, we\u2019ll park this one here. As ever, if you keep your eggs in the fridge, let them come up to room temperature before cracking \u2013 starting with a cold egg, Cloake says, means you\u2019re more likely to overcook the yolk trying to get the white to set. Fresh eggs are best for frying as they\u2019re less likely to spread in the pan (the stronger the proteins in the white, the neater the shape) \u2013 but, Cloake suggests, if you\u2019re struggling to perfect those whites, a slightly older egg that spreads and therefore gives a thinner white could work to your frying advantage. Pizarro breaks his eggs into a bowl or cup first, before sliding into a hot pan where, on landing, it should sizzle and spit a little. A lid, just smaller than the pan, is also a trusted ally: \u201cWhen the bottom of the egg is cooked to your liking, put a lid on top, take it off the heat and the residual heat will cook the egg,\u201d says Kirby. Roux waits for the white to \u201cfrizzle\u201d before covering and turning off the heat and leaving for a minute, while Cloake covers and leaves on a low heat for three and a half minutes. Seasoning should then be done at the last minute. Some suggest crispy whites and soak-up-with-toast yolk success can be found in separating the eggs: frying the whites and adding the yolk in the last few minutes of cooking. This seems like a lot of faff, especially when there are much simpler ways to crack (sorry) this. Have you got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com",

The players in St Louis were identical with those in Zagreb where Carlsen scored in majestic style, but this time he escaped his drawing run in only the final two games. His rare failure can be traced back to the St Louis speed event immediately before the Sinquefield Cup, where he lost 10 games out of 27 and confessed to loss of confidence. His early games in the Sinquefield were over-cautious as he struggled to gradually restore full self-belief. Carlsen will now take a break, returning in October for Fide\u2019s new 160-player event in the Isle of Man, a venue where the world champion previously scored in 2017. His current unbeaten run is 90 games, so its 11 rounds will give him the chance to break Ding\u2019s 100-game record. Carlsen\u2019s other target, a new rating record of 2,900 points, may have to wait until the Grand Tour final at London Olympia in December or Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee in January. Final Sinquefield Cup leading scores were Ding and Carlsen 6.5/11, Vishy Anand and Sergey Karjakin 6. The former world champion Anand, 49, was the oldest player by 13 years, yet could easily have won the tournament had he been able to cash in several favourable positions. The Indian said afterwards: \u201cI think it\u2019s the first tournament where I\u2019m completely gutted with my plus one. Normally you\u2019d be happy but I think with my positions Magnus would have made plus six. I am really embarrassed by my technique.\u201d As for Ding, he can expect a hero\u2019s welcome when he returns to Beijing and to his home city Wenzhou this weekend. His achievement marks a triumph for China\u2019s \u201cBig Dragon\u201d long-term strategy which launched in 1974 and aimed to make the country one of the leading chess powers by 2010. Its first big success came at the 1978 Olympaid, where the Dutch grandmaster Jan Hein Donner, who had made disparaging remarks about Chinese players, was brilliantly crushed in the 20-move \u201cChinese Immortal\u201d. When Xie Jun became world champion, China was one of the strongest countries in women\u2019s chess, and in 2014 they also captured gold in the open Olympiad. China currently holds both Olympiad titles while Ju Wenjun is the individual women\u2019s champion but it is Carlsen\u2019s crown which is the glittering prize. Ding Liren is already qualified through rating for the eight-player candidates in early 2020 which will settle Carlsen\u2019s next challenger. He is still narrowly behind Fabiano Caruana, who lost to Carlsen in 2018, in the ratings but seems likely to overtake the American very soon. 3634 1 Rh8! If exh1=Q 2 Rc8 mate. If d2 2 Qh7 mate.

      "body": "<p>After Nell Zink\u2019s mother died a few years ago, she asked her friend Tom to treat her for post-traumatic stress. Zink was having trouble sleeping, and her friend, a semi-famous German singer-songwriter, had retrained as a shaman. \u201cI laid down and closed my eyes, Tom did this shamanistic ritual, and when I came out of this trance an hour later, he looked at me and said: \u2018I am afraid I have to tell you, Nell, you have no subconscious mind.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Zink laughs hysterically while telling this very Zink-esque story. \u201cHe\u2019d gone into my mind, and there is usually an empty room with doors. But in my case that room was completely full with an over-the-top, psychedelic party that was really loud and populated by these nightmarish creatures. It was complete overload and there was no escape.\u201d</p> <p>A wild party in your mind, crammed with colourful characters and no taboos: as an introduction, that\u2019s also a good description of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/17/nell-zink-the-accidental-novelist-jonathan-franzen\" title=\"\">Nell Zink\u2019s fiction</a>. Her debut novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/13/wallcreeper-nell-zink-birds-review\" title=\"\">The Wallcreeper</a></em>, moved from birdwatching to anal sex within the opening seven pages. Her follow-ups, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/19/mislaid-nell-zink-novel-thrillingly-complicated\" title=\"\">Mislaid</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/29/nicotine-nell-zink-review-third-novel\" title=\"\">Nicotine</a></em> and <em>Private Novelist</em>, filled the room with all varieties of modern misfits: feminist squatters, smokers\u2019 rights activists, white lesbian mothers who self-identify as black, Israeli spies, mythical seal-women. <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008323486/doxology/\" title=\"\">In her latest, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008323486/doxology/\" title=\"\">Doxology</a></em>, the party gets even louder: the novel\u2019s main protagonists are a post-punk three-piece propelled by an unlikely Top 10 hit into a world of music videos, free drugs and signature dance moves.</p> <p>If Tom the shaman is right and all these people were merely hanging around on the surface of her waking mind, waiting to be harvested into short sharp novels, it would explain the speed of Zink\u2019s rise to fame: <em>Doxology</em> is the fifth book in five years from the 55-year-old writer who until 2014 was living in complete obscurity in a small town outside Berlin.</p> <p>When US magazines first took notice of her blackly comic prose, the rumour in the German capital\u2019s literary circles was that \u201cNell Zink\u201d had to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/18/jt-leroy-review-fake-author-kristen-stewart-laura-dern\" title=\"\">JT Leroy-style hoax</a>, or a pseudonym for an already established author such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/02/nell-zink-nicotine-interview-meet-author\" title=\"\">Jonathan Franzen, the US novelist who championed her</a>. Her writing was too stylistically assured for someone with no track record of plugging away on the fringes of the publishing industry, her name too neatly memorable. And who on earth would choose to live in Bad Belzig, a medieval spa town in Brandenburg, preened into pensioner-friendly blandness with post-Wall subsidies?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Her novels are usually set among exclusive social scenes with their own codes \u2013 birdwatchers, hippy communes, New York\u2019s  indie rock scene</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In fact, Zink lives in the middle of Bad Belzig\u2019s high street, in a top-floor flat that looks as if it is being let for the short term even though she has occupied it for six years, with mismatched pieces of furniture and a mattress in every corner of the room. Having completed a PhD in T\u00fcbingen, in Germany\u2019s south, she was looking for a place halfway between Dessau, where she has friends, and Berlin, which has airports, and her index finger landed here. \u201cIt\u2019s the spaceship principle\u201d, she says, pulling a wicker chair up to a marble table in her living room. \u201cI like having the infrastructure. I really like that when I want to go to the post office I have to walk 75 yards. There\u2019s a stationery shop, a drugstore, supermarkets, everything is really close.\u201d She\u2019s aware of the rumours about her fictional identity but unfazed by them: \u201cPeople who claim to live in Berlin but don\u2019t spend any time there, they are the real hoax\u201d.</p> <p>The other reason people assume Zink might not be real has to do with her prose style. Her novels are usually set among exclusive social scenes with their own codes and rituals \u2013 birdwatchers, hippy communes, New York\u2019s 90s indie rock scene \u2013 but they are always written from the inside. There are no rock cliches, no \u201cstabbing angular guitars\u201d in <em>Doxology</em>, but instead \u201chigh fretting\u201d, \u201cPhil Lesh meets the Congos bass\u201d. Who has the kind of life experience that makes them familiar with so many different walks of life and their mannerisms?</p> <p>\u201cI try to work with allusions and a sort of knowingness\u201d, says Zink, who was a masonry repairer, a secretary, a cocktail waitress, a translator and life model before starting to make a living from fiction. She says she trusts her readers to pick up the clues in her writing because she read a lot of science fiction as a child. \u201cIn science fiction it is often the case that you read for about an hour without knowing what is going on. What are these flowers supposed to be? Are they alive, are they carnivorous? The world-building is all by implication \u2026 It seems to me if people can get into science fiction, then they don\u2019t need fiction that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/25/jeffrey-eugenides-interview\" title=\"\">written the way [Jeffrey] Eugenides</a> or Franzen do it, where you get all the background information about every single character all the time.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Doxology</em>, the knowingness is both a pose appropriate to its setting, and a sign of lived experience. In the mid-90s, Zink played the guitar in F.E.R.R.E.T., a New York noisecore band she describes as \u201cterrible but glorious\u201d, and that doesn\u2019t sound too dissimilar to Marmalade Sky, the band at the heart of her new novel.</p> <p>\u201cIt has come to my attention that the times and places of my fiction and my biography can overlap. I lived in Virginia until about 89, and that\u2019s when <em>Mislaid</em> ends. This novel picks up in 89 in DC and New York, which is where I went after that. And yet there is nothing autobiographical about it, I swear. I use material because I think it makes for good fiction when you know what you are doing.\u201d</p> <p>In a novel in which characters often talk \u201cpitched low and on the inside, knowing and hopeless, every clause meaning and mourning its opposite\u201d, one of the most memorable and quotable passages mounts an earnest defence of what Zink calls the \u201c80s hipster\u201d: \u201cThe eighties hipster bore no resemblance to the bearded and effeminate cottage industrialist who came to prominence as the \u2018hipster\u2019 in the new century,\u201d it says. \u201cThe eighties hipster was the short-lived cap of spume on the dirty wave of working-class higher education.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Corona, California, in 1964, Zink studied and worked in Virginia and Washington DC before immersing herself in New York\u2019s music scene. As well as living in Germany, she also spent several years living in Israel. Is Zink still an 80s hipster at heart? She emphatically rejects this, only to slowly backtrack by narrowing down her definition even further: hipsterdom in the 80s was not just about intellectual one-upmanship, but an idealistic search for a kind of purity.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was way younger and more sensitive, before I watched Tarantino and still had a soul, I listened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/06/swans-michael-gira-tour-interview\" title=\"\">bands like Swans</a>, Foetus or Nurse With Wound. Someone hitting a garbage can lid over and over, amplified beyond belief with a lot of chorus on it. That\u2019s what hipsters listened to back in the 90s. Watching horror movies like <em>From Beyond</em>, or documentary footage of the Katyn forest massacre.\u201d</p> <p>While she played in F.E.R.R.E.T, Zink also published a fanzine called Animal Review, in which indie musicians wrote about their favourite animals (Steve Albini of the band Shellac wrote about lemurs). The tagline was \u201chard music and soft animals\u201d: jaded on the outside, sweet on the inside, that was the mode of her social circle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Zink wrote each of her first two novels each in the space of only three weeks. Doxology took much longer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Zink wrote each of her first two novels in the space of only three weeks. By her own admission, <em>Doxology</em> took much longer, undergoing several revisions, and it is more than just a period piece about 90s New York. \u201cI wanted to put together a mosaic that cast a unified shadow,\u201d she says.</p> <p>A \u201cdoxology\u201d is a short hymn of praise to God in Christian worship, but there are also instances of doxing (publicising others\u2019 private data online) and women referred to as doxies (sex workers). In ancient Greek, doxa can mean \u201cglory\u201d but also its apparent opposite, \u201cillusion\u201d, and one of the central paradoxes Zink\u2019s novel wrestles with is whether it is possible to be real by faking it.</p> <p>While the first half of <em>Doxology</em> is essentially a defence of the hipster\u2019s devotion to naivety and purity, exemplified at its most saintly by Marmalade Sky\u2019s singer Joe Harris, the second half investigates the limitations of the same mindset. We follow Flora, the daughter of guitarist Pam and drummer/keyboarder Daniel, a passionate environmental scientist who campaigns for Jill Stein, the Green party candidate who helped to split the left-liberal vote in the 2016 US elections. In the age of Trump, the search for moral purity can become a problem in its own right: good intentions aren\u2019t enough. Or, as Flora\u2019s boyfriend, an elderly Democratic strategist, says: \u201cPositive is how people feel when you unite them in hate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFlora would like to change the world, but how do you change the world?\u201d Zink asks. \u201cThere are 7 billion people, can anybody change the world? And then sometimes examples come along of horrible people who manage to change the world in distressing ways. Maybe effecting a negative change is possible for one person. To build something requires an entire ecosystem working together in concert. To break something, you just need one bullet.\u201d <em>Doxology</em> is, in the best possible sense, a novel at odds with itself. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Zink apparently doesn\u2019t have a subconscious mind, you could say it reads like the sound of an author whose intellect is wrestling with her heart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48a35a080e0717d6c3b801424ab8db0201a221e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48a35a080e0717d6c3b801424ab8db0201a221e7/0_222_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greta Thunberg on board the Malizia II in Plymouth on 13 August 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She is a child warrior character from an anime film\u2019 ...

The novel seems to anticipate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/19/greta-thunberg-attackers-climate-crisis-activist\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a>\u2019s rise to prominence. When I suggest this, Zink\u2019s response is surprisingly cautious. \u201cHer success in getting young people to skip school is certainly \u2026 remarkable,\u201d she says with composure, before remarking that even arch-conservative politicians in Bavaria have started to talk about cheaper public transport and banning plastic bags. I am about to express my agreement when she interrupts: \u201cIt\u2019s such a crock of bullshit! I don\u2019t know what flaming swords Greta Thunberg needs to have to get reactions that are not just crocks of shit.\u201d</p> <p>But isn\u2019t it a real achievement that politicians can no longer avoid talking about the climate crisis?

      "bodyText": "After Nell Zink\u2019s mother died a few years ago, she asked her friend Tom to treat her for post-traumatic stress. Zink was having trouble sleeping, and her friend, a semi-famous German singer-songwriter, had retrained as a shaman. \u201cI laid down and closed my eyes, Tom did this shamanistic ritual, and when I came out of this trance an hour later, he looked at me and said: \u2018I am afraid I have to tell you, Nell, you have no subconscious mind.\u2019\u201d Zink laughs hysterically while telling this very Zink-esque story. \u201cHe\u2019d gone into my mind, and there is usually an empty room with doors. But in my case that room was completely full with an over-the-top, psychedelic party that was really loud and populated by these nightmarish creatures. It was complete overload and there was no escape.\u201d A wild party in your mind, crammed with colourful characters and no taboos: as an introduction, that\u2019s also a good description of Nell Zink\u2019s fiction. Her debut novel, The Wallcreeper, moved from birdwatching to anal sex within the opening seven pages. Her follow-ups, Mislaid, Nicotine and Private Novelist, filled the room with all varieties of modern misfits: feminist squatters, smokers\u2019 rights activists, white lesbian mothers who self-identify as black, Israeli spies, mythical seal-women. In her latest, Doxology, the party gets even louder: the novel\u2019s main protagonists are a post-punk three-piece propelled by an unlikely Top 10 hit into a world of music videos, free drugs and signature dance moves. If Tom the shaman is right and all these people were merely hanging around on the surface of her waking mind, waiting to be harvested into short sharp novels, it would explain the speed of Zink\u2019s rise to fame: Doxology is the fifth book in five years from the 55-year-old writer who until 2014 was living in complete obscurity in a small town outside Berlin. When US magazines first took notice of her blackly comic prose, the rumour in the German capital\u2019s literary circles was that \u201cNell Zink\u201d had to be a JT Leroy-style hoax, or a pseudonym for an already established author such as Jonathan Franzen, the US novelist who championed her. Her writing was too stylistically assured for someone with no track record of plugging away on the fringes of the publishing industry, her name too neatly memorable. And who on earth would choose to live in Bad Belzig, a medieval spa town in Brandenburg, preened into pensioner-friendly blandness with post-Wall subsidies? In fact, Zink lives in the middle of Bad Belzig\u2019s high street, in a top-floor flat that looks as if it is being let for the short term even though she has occupied it for six years, with mismatched pieces of furniture and a mattress in every corner of the room. Having completed a PhD in T\u00fcbingen, in Germany\u2019s south, she was looking for a place halfway between Dessau, where she has friends, and Berlin, which has airports, and her index finger landed here. \u201cIt\u2019s the spaceship principle\u201d, she says, pulling a wicker chair up to a marble table in her living room. \u201cI like having the infrastructure. I really like that when I want to go to the post office I have to walk 75 yards. There\u2019s a stationery shop, a drugstore, supermarkets, everything is really close.\u201d She\u2019s aware of the rumours about her fictional identity but unfazed by them: \u201cPeople who claim to live in Berlin but don\u2019t spend any time there, they are the real hoax\u201d. The other reason people assume Zink might not be real has to do with her prose style. Her novels are usually set among exclusive social scenes with their own codes and rituals \u2013 birdwatchers, hippy communes, New York\u2019s 90s indie rock scene \u2013 but they are always written from the inside. There are no rock cliches, no \u201cstabbing angular guitars\u201d in Doxology, but instead \u201chigh fretting\u201d, \u201cPhil Lesh meets the Congos bass\u201d. Who has the kind of life experience that makes them familiar with so many different walks of life and their mannerisms? \u201cI try to work with allusions and a sort of knowingness\u201d, says Zink, who was a masonry repairer, a secretary, a cocktail waitress, a translator and life model before starting to make a living from fiction. She says she trusts her readers to pick up the clues in her writing because she read a lot of science fiction as a child. \u201cIn science fiction it is often the case that you read for about an hour without knowing what is going on. What are these flowers supposed to be? Are they alive, are they carnivorous? The world-building is all by implication \u2026 It seems to me if people can get into science fiction, then they don\u2019t need fiction that is written the way [Jeffrey] Eugenides or Franzen do it, where you get all the background information about every single character all the time.\u201d In Doxology, the knowingness is both a pose appropriate to its setting, and a sign of lived experience. In the mid-90s, Zink played the guitar in F.E.R.R.E.T., a New York noisecore band she describes as \u201cterrible but glorious\u201d, and that doesn\u2019t sound too dissimilar to Marmalade Sky, the band at the heart of her new novel. \u201cIt has come to my attention that the times and places of my fiction and my biography can overlap. I lived in Virginia until about 89, and that\u2019s when Mislaid ends. This novel picks up in 89 in DC and New York, which is where I went after that. And yet there is nothing autobiographical about it, I swear. I use material because I think it makes for good fiction when you know what you are doing.\u201d In a novel in which characters often talk \u201cpitched low and on the inside, knowing and hopeless, every clause meaning and mourning its opposite\u201d, one of the most memorable and quotable passages mounts an earnest defence of what Zink calls the \u201c80s hipster\u201d: \u201cThe eighties hipster bore no resemblance to the bearded and effeminate cottage industrialist who came to prominence as the \u2018hipster\u2019 in the new century,\u201d it says. \u201cThe eighties hipster was the short-lived cap of spume on the dirty wave of working-class higher education.\u201d Born in Corona, California, in 1964, Zink studied and worked in Virginia and Washington DC before immersing herself in New York\u2019s music scene. As well as living in Germany, she also spent several years living in Israel. Is Zink still an 80s hipster at heart? She emphatically rejects this, only to slowly backtrack by narrowing down her definition even further: hipsterdom in the 80s was not just about intellectual one-upmanship, but an idealistic search for a kind of purity. \u201cWhen I was way younger and more sensitive, before I watched Tarantino and still had a soul, I listened to bands like Swans, Foetus or Nurse With Wound. Someone hitting a garbage can lid over and over, amplified beyond belief with a lot of chorus on it. That\u2019s what hipsters listened to back in the 90s. Watching horror movies like From Beyond, or documentary footage of the Katyn forest massacre.\u201d While she played in F.E.R.R.E.T, Zink also published a fanzine called Animal Review, in which indie musicians wrote about their favourite animals (Steve Albini of the band Shellac wrote about lemurs). The tagline was \u201chard music and soft animals\u201d: jaded on the outside, sweet on the inside, that was the mode of her social circle. Zink wrote each of her first two novels in the space of only three weeks. By her own admission, Doxology took much longer, undergoing several revisions, and it is more than just a period piece about 90s New York. \u201cI wanted to put together a mosaic that cast a unified shadow,\u201d she says. A \u201cdoxology\u201d is a short hymn of praise to God in Christian worship, but there are also instances of doxing (publicising others\u2019 private data online) and women referred to as doxies (sex workers). In ancient Greek, doxa can mean \u201cglory\u201d but also its apparent opposite, \u201cillusion\u201d, and one of the central paradoxes Zink\u2019s novel wrestles with is whether it is possible to be real by faking it. While the first half of Doxology is essentially a defence of the hipster\u2019s devotion to naivety and purity, exemplified at its most saintly by Marmalade Sky\u2019s singer Joe Harris, the second half investigates the limitations of the same mindset. We follow Flora, the daughter of guitarist Pam and drummer/keyboarder Daniel, a passionate environmental scientist who campaigns for Jill Stein, the Green party candidate who helped to split the left-liberal vote in the 2016 US elections. In the age of Trump, the search for moral purity can become a problem in its own right: good intentions aren\u2019t enough. Or, as Flora\u2019s boyfriend, an elderly Democratic strategist, says: \u201cPositive is how people feel when you unite them in hate.\u201d \u201cFlora would like to change the world, but how do you change the world?\u201d Zink asks. \u201cThere are 7 billion people, can anybody change the world? And then sometimes examples come along of horrible people who manage to change the world in distressing ways. Maybe effecting a negative change is possible for one person. To build something requires an entire ecosystem working together in concert. To break something, you just need one bullet.\u201d Doxology is, in the best possible sense, a novel at odds with itself. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Zink apparently doesn\u2019t have a subconscious mind, you could say it reads like the sound of an author whose intellect is wrestling with her heart. In her second novel, Mislaid, the protagonist used a stolen birth certificate to create an African American identity for herself and her daughter \u2013 a plot line conceived before the world had heard the name Rachel Dolezal, an official for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People who turned out to have no African ancestry whatsoever. Doxology seems to achieve a similar feat of clairvoyance. The novel seems to anticipate Greta Thunberg\u2019s rise to prominence. When I suggest this, Zink\u2019s response is surprisingly cautious. \u201cHer success in getting young people to skip school is certainly \u2026 remarkable,\u201d she says with composure, before remarking that even arch-conservative politicians in Bavaria have started to talk about cheaper public transport and banning plastic bags. I am about to express my agreement when she interrupts: \u201cIt\u2019s such a crock of bullshit! I don\u2019t know what flaming swords Greta Thunberg needs to have to get reactions that are not just crocks of shit.\u201d But isn\u2019t it a real achievement that politicians can no longer avoid talking about the climate crisis? Zink is having none of it. \u201cYour memory isn\u2019t very long. Merkel used to talk about the environment all the time. And nothing happened. She worked actively against her own promises. It was lies. They lie. They are going to lie to Greta Thunberg.\u201d She gets up to fetch a tissue and dab her eyes, then returns to the table. \u201cThe question is: how angry is Greta Thunberg going to get, and will they still take her seriously after she is angry?

We\u2019re also concerned with what\u2019s happening in other forests and ecosystems, and with the broader and rapid degradation of nature. The risk is we are moving towards the tipping points that scientists talk about that could produce cascading collapses of natural systems.\u201d</p> \n<p>The world\u2019s environmental crises are an increasing concern in international politics. Deforestation of the Amazon was high on the agenda of this week\u2019s G7 meeting in Biarritz, France. In September, world leaders will gather in New York for a climate action summit.

      "bodyText": "The fires in the Amazon are \u201cextraordinarily concerning\u201d for the planet\u2019s natural life support systems, the head of the UN\u2019s top biodiversity body has said in a call for countries, companies and consumers to build a new relationship with nature. Cristiana Pa\u015fca Palmer, the executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, said the destruction of the world\u2019s biggest rainforest was a grim reminder that a fresh approach was needed to stabilise the climate and prevent ecosystems from declining to a point of no return, with dire consequences for humanity. \u201cThe Amazon fires make the point that we face a very serious crisis,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cBut it is not just the Amazon. We\u2019re also concerned with what\u2019s happening in other forests and ecosystems, and with the broader and rapid degradation of nature. The risk is we are moving towards the tipping points that scientists talk about that could produce cascading collapses of natural systems.\u201d The world\u2019s environmental crises are an increasing concern in international politics. Deforestation of the Amazon was high on the agenda of this week\u2019s G7 meeting in Biarritz, France. In September, world leaders will gather in New York for a climate action summit. Next year, they are scheduled to get together again for a nature summit before a UN biodiversity conference in Kunming, China, in October. Pa\u015fca Palmer said: \u201cI am grateful that [French president Emmanuel] Macron gave biodiversity a level of attention that we haven\u2019t seen before. I hope this is not an isolated event at a G7, but that it continues as we move forward and that it will inspire a race to the top for political leaders.\u201d Nature needed to be at the heart of any proposed solution, she said, adding: \u201cWe cannot treat this in isolation. We cannot solve climate change without biodiversity.\u201d For most of the past three decades, the natural world was treated almost as an afterthought by world leaders. If discussed at all, it was with platitudes about the need to save polar bears and tigers. But the collapse of pollinator populations and growing awareness of human dependence on forests and other ecosystems has started to make an impact. This year, the world\u2019s leading scientists warned that human civilisation was in jeopardy because forest clearance, land-use shifts, pollution and climate change had put a million species at risk of extinction. Many environmentalists were dismissive of the $20m the G7 offered to support firefighting operations in the Amazon, but there is more optimism about the longer-term reforestation plan that France and Chile have promised to announce at next month\u2019s climate action summit. The UN official said the G7 fund was valuable but money was not enough. \u201cWe need to address the root causes,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if the amount involved in extinguishing fires in rainforests was a billion or 500 million dollars, we won\u2019t see an improvement unless more profound structural changes are taking place. We need a transformation in the way we consume and produce. \u201cThis is not just about biodiversity conservation, it\u2019s about finance and trade and changing the model of development. We need to put biodiversity and natural capital at the centre of the economic paradigm.\u201d At the climate action summit in September, world leaders will be asked to raise their emissions-cutting ambitions and to explore new approaches to drawing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. They will discuss nature-based solutions, which covers how restoration of forests can help to stabilise the climate. Among those who will address the summit is the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who arrived in New York this week after sailing across the Atlantic on a zero-carbon racing yacht. \u201cEven on a boat I heard about the fires in the Amazon, the rainforest. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d she told a press conference on the quayside. \u201cIt\u2019s so horrible. It\u2019s hard to imagine. The war against nature must end.\u201d Earlier in the year, the teenage campaigner urged action against deforestation. \u201cWe are literally sawing off the branch we live on,\u201d she wrote. Several countries have recently organised massive tree-planting campaigns. Last month, Ethiopia claimed a record of 350m seedlings in a day. There have also been significant efforts in China, which has pledged to plant an area the size of Ireland every year, while the Indian state of Punjab has introduced a scheme to link gun licences to tree planting. Scientists say tree planting has an important role to play in climate stabilisation, but protection and restoration of existing forests was essential, particularly in the tropics. Pa\u015fca Palmer stressed the need for an integrated approach, such as the biodiversity programmes drawn up by Costa Rica and Colombia, which she hopes will lead at next year\u2019s global meeting in Kunming to a new global framework for biodiversity. \u201cI hope this will have a snowball effect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a growing movement. I feel that now the heads of state are embracing this, we have a good signal.\u201d",

The collaborative series with the University of Newcastle\u2019s colonial massacres research team found there were at least 270 frontier massacres over 140 years as part of a state-sanctioned and organised attempt to eradicate Aboriginal people. The Killing Times documented the history of Australia\u2019s frontier wars through the development of an interactive map showing every verifiable site of frontier conflict in the process of colonisation, from 1788 to 1930. To create the map, Guardian Australia\u2019s team refined, extended and analysed the University of Newcastle\u2019s dataset and, using the same strict research methods, identified an additional 15 sites in Western Australia, and published the first full picture of the continent\u2019s Indigenous massacres. The map is the first of its kind to be produced by any media outlet, and uniquely can be searched by date, time, location, postcode, perpetrator group and/or death count.

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning \u2013 and a happy Labor Day weekend. I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. The briefing will be back on Tuesday. Fears Dorian will hit Florida as category 4 hurricane Florida has declared a state of emergency after weather experts warned the state\u2019s entire east coast could be under threat from Hurricane Dorian, which is expected to make landfall as a category 3 or 4 hurricane early on Monday. The storm did only limited damage as it passed through the northern Caribbean on Wednesday, sparing Puerto Rico but setting course for the US mainland. Stockpiling advice. Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, urged residents to stockpile a week\u2019s worth of food and emergency supplies. Georgia has also declared a state of emergency in 12 coastal counties. Trump plans. Donald Trump has cancelled a planned trip to Poland to commemorate the second world war this weekend to monitor the storm in Florida, and has sent the vice-president, Mike Pence, to Europe in his stead. Life of asylum seeker on hunger strike at risk, says doctor An Indian asylum seeker, who has gone on hunger strike while detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in El Paso, is receiving \u201cabysmal\u201d treatment that puts his life at risk, a doctor has warned in an affidavit filed this week. Ice began force-feeding Ajay Kumar two weeks ago; Dr Parveen Parmar, the chief of global emergency medicine at the University of Southern California, said the 33-year-old is receiving \u201cthe worst medical care I have seen in my 10 years of practice\u201d. Force feeding. Kumar is one of three Indian men being force-fed while on hunger strike at the detention centre in El Paso, an act that medical and human rights groups have decried as inhuman and degrading. Family reunited. A cognitively disabled Salvadorian migrant who arrived in El Paso with a cousin but was sent to Mexico alone by immigration authorities has been reunited with his family in Virginia after five months. Comey \u2018violated FBI policies\u2019 by sharing Trump memos The former FBI director James Comey violated justice department policies by sharing memos on his personal interactions with Trump, a report by a department watchdog has found. Comey\u2019s memos included notes on sensitive conversations with the president, which helped to spark the Mueller investigation. Comey took the report as an exoneration, tweeting that an apology from those who \u201cdefamed\u201d him \u201cwould be nice\u201d. Trump saw it differently, saying Comey was \u201cdisgraced and excoriated\u201d. Space Command. Trump on Thursday took to the White House Rose Garden to officially announce the re-establishment of the US military\u2019s space command, describing space as \u201cthe next warfighting domain\u201d. Pro-democracy figures arrested in Hong Kong crackdown Three leading pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong have been arrested as part of a crackdown on protesters amid the city\u2019s most serious political crisis in decades. Joshua Wong, a former student leader during the \u201cumbrella movement\u201d of 2014, was \u201cforcefully pushed into a private minivan\u201d while walking to a subway station early on Friday morning, fellow activists said. Agnes Chow, another top member of the group Demosist\u014d, and Andy Chan, the head of a now banned pro-independence party, were also arrested. Wong and Chow have been released. Prescient interview. Wong was still in prison when the current protests began, but in an interview he predicted the crackdown that led to his re-arrest, writes Tania Branigan. Leaderless movement. Chow and Wong were arrested on suspicion of \u201cinciting others to participate in an unauthorised assembly\u201d. But, to the frustration of authorities, today\u2019s protest movement is leaderless, as Ilaria Maria Sala reports. Crib sheet Lawmakers in the California senate are considering a bill that could enact the world\u2019s most progressive protections for workers in the gig economy, fundamentally altering the employment rights of Uber drivers and others in the state. The fires raging across the Brazilian Amazon have reached protected indigenous reserves, raising concerns that loggers and land grabbers may have targeted areas occupied by isolated and vulnerable indigenous tribes such as the Aw\u00e1. A major new study has squashed the notion of a single \u201cgay gene\u201d that leads to homosexuality, finding instead that homosexual behaviour is influenced by a multitude of genetic variants, as well as non-genetic factors. An Alabama man who was sentenced to life in prison for stealing $50.75 from a bakery in 1983 is to be freed after 36 years behind bars. Alvin Kennard, then 22, was given the unusually harsh sentence under Alabama\u2019s \u201cthree strikes law\u201d. Must-reads Can Hollywood take care of its child stars? A new movie depicts the final days of Judy Garland, the child star who became a cautionary tale for young performers of later decades. Danny Leigh asks whether her story \u2013 or those that came after \u2013 has done anything fundamentally to change an industry \u201cthat feeds on the young\u201d. How the prison economy works For his new book about extreme economies, Richard Davies visited Angola maximum-security jail in Louisiana, America\u2019s largest prison. He expected to find a simple bartering structure, but was instead introduced to a \u201ccomplex and modern system of hidden trade that offers an important lesson about the way economies work\u201d.

As a result of her writing, she was targeted for harassment and abuse by white supremacist trolls, which culminated in her house being \u201cswatted\u201d and her teenage son seized by armed police. \u201cI\u2019m not going to disappear,\u201d she writes. \u201cNo matter what comes my way.\u201d Posters for films that never happened The designer Fernando Reza has created a striking series of posters for potential cinema classics that never made it past pre-production, from Tim Burton\u2019s Superman sequel starring Nicolas Cage, to Quentin Tarantino\u2019s much-discussed but never-made The Vega Brothers. Opinion From 2010 to 2017 almost 500,000 Americans filed flood insurance claims, more than double the number during Reagan\u2019s presidency.

So, a policy that eliminates the disparities in health insurance by providing health insurance for all is a policy that is antiracist because it eliminates racial disparity, but it clearly helps white people too. I think that it\u2019s incredibly important for people to see why many of the inequities that we have in society \u2013 whether gendered, class, or other means \u2013 are actually being reinforced by racism.</p> <h2><strong>In your book you say you\u2019ve been complicit to racism in the past. Do we need to talk more about racism within the black community?</strong></h2> <p>I think within black spaces, there has been a lot of conversation around these issues. I think outside of black spaces, there has not necessarily been as much conversation. I think that the terms that have been utilized within black spaces, or even outside of black spaces, have not necessarily been the terms that I was using in <em>How to be an Antiracist</em>. So for instance, black people have historically called certain other black people sell outs. They\u2019ve called them Oreos. We called it many different terms. We\u2019ve also talked about internalized racism. But we haven\u2019t taken the next step, generally speaking, where [we discuss how] that black person who thought that black people are lazy, and went after black people as opposed to racism, is being racist too.</p> <h2><strong>What made you share your own complicity with racism?</strong></h2> <p>I think the heartbeat of antiracism is confession \u2013 the ability to self-reflect, to admit one\u2019s own racist upbringing, to take an accounting of ourselves and the racist ideas that we\u2019ve believed over the course of our lifetime, to think deeply about the policies and policymakers who are racist that we support. This accounting is essential for us to change. How to be an Antiracist is largely a confessional accounting of myself, which was necessary for me to begin and continue the process of striving to be an answer.</p> <h2><strong>How is the fight between racism and sexism linked?</strong></h2> <p>First and foremost, black women are a racial group. People introduce racist ideas to demean black women. In terms of those ideas, there\u2019s been specific policies that are intersecting in terms of racist and sexist policies that have targeted and harmed black women. The same thing with black men, in terms of them being a racial group that have been affected by racist ideas and policies. If I as a black male reject the racist ideas about black men and accept the racist ideas about black women, then whenever I\u2019m accepting those ideas or stating that black women are not believable or can\u2019t be raped, I\u2019m actually expressing one of the oldest racist ideas, which is that of the unrapeable black woman. And I need to take an accounting and recognize that, as I certainly did in this book.</p> <h2><strong>Your book talks about celebrities who fall short when it comes to race. Chris Rock was one example. What do you think about his work?</strong></h2> <p>I think to be antiracist is to recognize our personal complexities in the sense of what we\u2019re fighting. We\u2019re fighting internally to be antiracist. So, in terms of assessing other people, we should allow for people to essentially make racist mistakes. When it came to Chris Rock, eventually he stopped doing the skit that distinguished between black people and n\u2014s, which I would argue is the skit that allows black people to imagine themselves as superior to other black people who are labeled the n-word. I think he grew. Eventually he stopped doing that skit. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that he became an antiracist. In critiquing anyone else\u2019s ideas, they became a backseat to me critiquing my own about black people.</p> <h2><strong>In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/arts/ibram-x-kendi-antiracism.html\">your interview with the New York Times</a>, you talked about how your cancer diagnosis forced you to reflect on your mortality, which has a universal resonance in today\u2019s era of Black Lives Matter. You also coined the phrase \u2018</strong><strong>metastatic racism</strong><strong>\u2019. What does black survival mean for you now?</strong></h2> <p>I think that before that diagnosis, and before even my wife\u2019s diagnosis, I had not necessarily connected racism to cancer. I actually thought that this was not an appropriate analogy. But I think after taking care of someone, fighting cancer myself, and simultaneously studying racism, the similarity became quite apparent to me. It became apparent to me that in order to survive cancer, we have to believe that we <em>can</em> survive cancer. Similarly, in order to survive racism, we have to believe we <em>can</em> survive racism. Because when any group of people stop believing that they can survive metastatic racism, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to wage the fight against racism and to endure the pain that typically comes during that fight. So it caused me to become more committed through the challenging moments of fighting racism. It\u2019s going to be challenging, just like it\u2019s extremely challenging to fight metastatic cancer.</p>",

Salvini earmarked 19 October for a \u201cpeaceful day of Italian pride\u201d against a potential government made up of his former ally, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), and the centre-left Democratic party (PD). \u201cFrom north to south, from the silent majority \u2026 a day of mobilisation for those who don\u2019t want a government born overnight in Brussels,\u201d he said in an announcement on Facebook. \u201cI\u2019m not angry because of my own personal interests, I\u2019m angry because a robbery of democracy is under way.\u201d Salvini, who is still nominally the interior minister, has accused Brussels and Berlin of plotting to eject the League from government, taking particular aim at the EU\u2019s budget commissioner, G\u00fcnther Oettinger, who said a M5S-PD tie-up was \u201cgreat news\u201d for Italy and the EU. \u201cBut they won\u2019t get rid of the Salvini and League ballbreakers so easily,\u201d Salvini said. Salvini has also planned a series of rallies across Italy before the Rome demonstration, while his far-right ally, Brothers of Italy, has urged people to take to the streets beforehand. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was given a fresh mandate on Thursday to try to secure a pact with M5S and the PD in an effort to stave off early elections. Conte said now was \u201ca time for relaunch\u201d while insisting Italy return to being a \u201cprotagonist\u201d in the EU. Conte has until next week to ensure the two sides set aside their myriad differences to create a strong and lasting government. They still need to draft a programme, pick a cabinet and establish what role Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader, will play. The PD insisted he step down as deputy prime minister in return for them accepting Conte as prime minister. Another of the PD\u2019s stipulations for the deal is M5S, which has long been antagonistic towards the EU, commit to remaining in the bloc and scrapping a draconian anti-immigration bill passed with the League. A potential threat is the plan by M5S to ask its members to vote on any agreement with the PD on Rousseau, the online network it often uses to make policy decisions. It is unclear how many subscribers the site has or how votes are counted, but many M5S activists oppose the alliance. If they manage to form a government, among the first challenges will be drafting Italy\u2019s budget for 2020 and averting an increase in VAT. \u201cIf they can survive that, they might try to go for the long run,\u201d said Franco Pavoncello, a political science professor and the president of the John Cabot University in Rome. \u201cAlso because they might be interested in making an electoral reform that could restrict Salvini, as well as shoot for 2022, when a new president has to be elected. Both parties have an interest to stick around. But this is way into the future.\u201d",

You\u2019ll find out about Objects of Power (hilariously prosaic items, usually, that give Faden extra powers) and Altered World Events, in which other dimensions encroach on the real world, and which the FBC was set up to deal with. It\u2019s as though Remedy challenged itself to cram every preposterous paranormal concept it could think of into a single game. But remarkably, it all manages to hang together, providing a meaty, exciting and utterly unforgettable video game experience.",

He was released from prison on 17 June, four days before the protests in Hong Kong in which demonstrators surrounded police headquarters. He was charged on Friday over his involvement.

He was charged on Friday with offences including organising an unlawful assembly and released. Agnes Chow Agnes Chow is, like Wong, a former student leader of the umbrella movement in 2014.

Chow joined demonstrations against government plans to introduce \u201cmoral and national education\u201d in 2012 \u2013 criticised by opponents as communist brainwashing \u2013 and it was there she met Joshua Wong. Chow recently travelled to Tokyo, where she urged the Japanese government to help put pressure on the Hong Kong authorities to withdraw the controversial extradition bill. Speaking in Japanese at the Japan National Press Club during her visit in June, Chow called on Tokyo to \u201cpay more attention to this dangerous bill\u201d, warning that it was not only Hong Kong residents who would be affected but also overseas visitors. Such visitors could find themselves being extradited to mainland China, which she described as \u201ca place without the rule of law, without protection of human rights and freedom\u201d. She was charged with offences including taking part in an unlawful assembly and released. Andy Chan Andy Chan, the head of the Hong Kong National party, came to international attention in September last year when his party was banned by the city\u2019s security bureau for calling for independence for Hong Kong from mainland China. The bureau said the party was a threat to national security and the ban marked the first case of its kind since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The ban forced Chan to withdraw from public appearances but not before he spoke at a widely attended event at the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club. Several weeks later, the immigration department declined to extend the visa of the event moderator, Victor Mallet, a journalist with the Financial Times.

After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen\u2019s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills that have been passed during that session and summarises what has been achieved.</p>\n    <p>It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Parliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen\u2019s speech at the formal state opening of parliament.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The full legal challenge, tabled last month before Johnson announced this week that he would suspend parliament, was originally due to be heard next Friday. </p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not satisfied that it has been demonstrated that there\u2019s a need for an interim suspension or an interim interdict to be granted at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to move the substantive hearing forward to Tuesday. Weighing consideration in the balance, it\u2019s in the interest of justice and in the public interest that it proceeds sooner rather than later.\u201d</p> \n<p>O\u2019Neill had urged Doherty to reject claims from the UK government\u2019s lawyers, Roddy Dunlop QC and Andrew Webster QC, that the hearings may need to take place on other days because a hearing on Tuesday clashed with other cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to this.

      "bodyText": "A Scottish judge has temporarily rejected calls to block Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament, in a blow to anti-Brexit campaigners. Lord Doherty said he would not rule definitively that the prime minister had the powers to ask the Queen to prorogue parliament until a full hearing of the case, which he brought forward to Tuesday next week. He rejected an application from lawyers acting for 75 anti-Brexit MPs and peers for an emergency interdict, or injunction, requiring Johnson to suspend the prorogation. In a surprise development, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer acting for the MPs and peers, called in court for Johnson to provide a sworn affidavit under oath setting out why he needed to prorogue parliament. O\u2019Neill also said he reserved the right to call Johnson to give evidence in court at a later date. Joanna Cherry QC, the Scottish National party MP who is leading the legal challenge, urged the prime minister to provide a statement. \u201cTell the court the truth in sworn testimony,\u201d Cherry said outside court. \u201c[If] he believes that he has a good case for prorogation, he should have the guts to swear an affidavit.\u201d She said an off-guard disclosure by Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, caught on microphone on Thursday, that prorogation was a political gambit to frustrate anti-Brexit MPs in parliament was powerful evidence in their favour. Doherty said he saw no urgent need for a temporary interdict ordering Johnson to drop prorogation at this stage but he agreed that the full case needed to be heard urgently. The full legal challenge, tabled last month before Johnson announced this week that he would suspend parliament, was originally due to be heard next Friday. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied that it has been demonstrated that there\u2019s a need for an interim suspension or an interim interdict to be granted at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to move the substantive hearing forward to Tuesday. Weighing consideration in the balance, it\u2019s in the interest of justice and in the public interest that it proceeds sooner rather than later.\u201d O\u2019Neill had urged Doherty to reject claims from the UK government\u2019s lawyers, Roddy Dunlop QC and Andrew Webster QC, that the hearings may need to take place on other days because a hearing on Tuesday clashed with other cases. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to this. Any delay of any sort is potentially fundamentally prejudicial, not simply to the interests of the petitioners but to the country as a whole.\u201d The UK government faces parallel legal actions by anti-Brexit campaigners in London and Belfast. A government spokeswoman said: \u201cAs we have set out, the government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda, and MPs are not prevented from scrutinising our withdrawal from the EU. \u201cWe are glad the court found against the interdict. There was no good reason to seek one, given the full hearing is due to take place next week and the process of bringing the session to an end will not start until the week commencing 9 September.\u201d Cherry said she was happy the case had been expedited. \u201cI see that as a victory for us,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has said there is no urgency over the weekend, because of course the order which came from Balmoral on Wednesday says parliament cannot be prorogued before 9 September.\u201d The Labour MP Ian Murray, who is backing the legal action, said: \u201cThis verdict means a full hearing has been fast-tracked to next week, which is now the most important week in modern British history. \u201cIt is disappointing that we have to go to the courts to protect British democracy, but Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to silence the people\u2019s representatives cannot go unchallenged. As well as this legal battle in the court of session, the campaign against a no-deal Brexit will also take place in the House of Commons.\u201d The ruling came as a similar application for an emergency injunction in Belfast\u2019s high court on the grounds was put back until next week when the judge sees parliament\u2019s response to Boris Johnson\u2019s decision. \u201cEvery morning you wake up and there\u2019s something new that has occurred here,\u201d Northern Ireland\u2019s lord chief justice Sir Declan Morgan said during Friday\u2019s short hearing in Belfast. Lawyers for campaigner Raymond McCord, who is taking the action, were told to file papers by the end of play Monday in readiness for a full hearing no later than Friday next week.",

Her latest, and possibly best, stars Honor Swinton Byrne as a film student caught up in a toxic co-dependent relationship with a secretive civil servant (Tom Burke).</p> <h2>Bait (15)</h2> <p><em>(Mark Jenkin, 2019, UK) 89 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVlPl0SXFiE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eVlPl0SXFiE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>With his fifth feature, British director Mark Jenkin emerges from the shadows with a lo-fi indie that marks him as a talent to watch. Bait\u2019s story of inter-class tensions in gentrified Cornwall might be the currency of any social-issues drama, but Jenkin\u2019s stark style \u2013 luminous, distressed monochrome celluloid \u2013 adds a strange, hypnotic atmosphere.</p> <h2>Pain and Glory (15)</h2> <p><em>(Pedro Almod\u00f3var, 2019, Spa) 113 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEjFOkCKb3g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pEjFOkCKb3g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>An in-depth knowledge of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s output helps to make the most of the director\u2019s most autobiographical film to date, but it\u2019s not entirely necessary. It\u2019s perfectly possible to sit back and enjoy one of Antonio Banderas\u2019s best performances, as a once-great director forced to contemplate past lives and loves as he deals with bad health, depression and addiction.</p> <h2>Memory: The Origins of Alien (15)</h2> <p><em>(Alexandre O Philippe, 2019, US) 93 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuKQfEX1Xy4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fuKQfEX1Xy4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This deep-dive into the world of Ridley Scott\u2019s haunted-house-in-space movie is not for novices; a passing acquaintance with the 1979 original won\u2019t be enough to keep up with this fast-moving, digressive doc. The making-of story is quickly dispensed with before Philippe turns his attentions to subtext, making fascinating asides on body horror, insect behaviour and class divisions on board the Nostromo.</p> <h2>Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood (18)</h2> <p><em>(Quentin Tarantino, 2019, UK/US/Chi) 161 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELeMaP8EPAA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ELeMaP8EPAA?start=14&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=14\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The film that launched a thousand thinkpieces continues to thwart its critics \u2013 Tarantino\u2019s ninth film is now the second biggest global hit of his 27-year career. Granted, some of its stamina is due to the inspired casting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt as a Butch and Sundance-style TV star and stuntman combo, who face extinction in 1969\u2019s hippie Hollywood, and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, poster girl for the flower children.</p> <p><em>DW</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"399bddec20a475c42af3613fd578a3f4ae662402\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/399bddec20a475c42af3613fd578a3f4ae662402/0_195_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Flaming Lips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coyne slots\u2026 The Flaming Lips.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Griner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Four Tet</h2> <p>More than 20 years into his career, Kieran Hebden, AKA Four Tet, continues to push and pull at dance music\u2019s boundaries. April\u2019s single Teenage Birdsong found him dipping back into the more blissed-out side of his musical experiments, while his recent production work on Neneh Cherry\u2019s Broken Politics album accentuated a darker hue. Expect a proper feast for the senses. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.fabriclondon.com/club/listing/1829\">Fabric, EC1, Sunday 1 September</a></em></p> <h2>L Devine</h2> <p>Pop upstart L Devine (her real name, Olivia Devine, was already taken by a porn star), started her career as a seven-year-old punk in a band called the Safety Pins. Eventually she switched to pop, crafting characterful, first-album-era-Charli XCX-esque bops that touch on homophobia (Daughter), a lack of sex (last single Naked Alone) and peer pressure (er, Peer Pressure). <br><em><a href=\"http://www.omearalondon.com/events/l-devine/\">Omeara, SE1, Wednesday 4 September</a></em></p> <h2>Serpentwithfeet</h2> <p>Fresh from dueting with Bj\u00f6rk every night at her recent New York residency and collaborating with hip-hop rabble Brockhampton, chamber pop experimentalist Josiah Wise recently took a surprising turn by employing the services of will-this-do rent-a-guest Ty Dolla $ign on single Receipts. That the song still fits within Wise\u2019s idiosyncratic musical world is testament to his singular artistry. <br><em><a href=\"https://earthackney.co.uk/calendar/serpentwithfeet\">EartH, N16, Tuesday 3 September</a></em></p> <h2>The Flaming Lips</h2> <p>Conceived as the soundtrack to an \u201cimmersive head-trip fantasy experience\u201d devised by eternally grizzled frontman Wayne Coyne, the Flaming Lips\u2019 15th album, King\u2019s Mouth, continues the band\u2019s tradition for, well, being bonkers, basically. Expect lots of retina-burning visuals and perhaps another outing for Coyne\u2019s recent accessory: the eyepatch. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.flaminglips.com/tour/\">Usher Hall, Edinburgh, Thursday 5; Manchester Academy, Friday 6; O2 Brixton Academy, SW9, 7 September</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Kefaya and Camilla George</h2> <p>November\u2019s mammoth London jazz festival gets a summer heads-up on this day-long Docklands freebie \u2013 with former Jazz Jamaica saxophonist Camilla George weaving her postbop, Afrobeat and Caribbean influences into Kefaya\u2019s jazz, dub and Afghan folk mix (4pm), and multi-idiom international sounds from the vivacious Turbans, Cykada, Kinetika Bloco and more. <br><em><a href=\"https://efglondonjazzfestival.org.uk/events/efg-london-jazz-festival-summer-stage\">Royal Albert Dock, E16, Saturday 31 August</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89f1bbe61f0291dd762a8e5a328d608e2c441d85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89f1bbe61f0291dd762a8e5a328d608e2c441d85/0_107_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernard Haitink\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Final movement\u2026 Bernard Haitink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Rosenberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bernard Haitink</h2> <p>No conductor of our time has been a more important part of London\u2019s musical scene than Bernard Haitink. He was principal conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam for more than 25 years, but he was also chief conductor of the London Philharmonic, and then musical director of both Glyndebourne and the Royal Opera, while he has also worked with the London Symphony Orchestra. But Haitink\u2019s concert of Beethoven and Bruckner at the Proms this week with the Vienna Philharmonic will be his last here. At the age of 90, he\u2019s retiring; he\u2019ll be sorely missed. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e584mb\">Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Tuesday 3 September</a></em></p> <h2>Scoring a Century</h2> <p>One of the finest new British operas of the last half-century was David Blake\u2019s Toussaint in 1977, based on the life of the Haitian revolutionary Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. Blake\u2019s most recent opera, 1999\u2019s Scoring a Century, is being staged in London for the first time by British Youth Opera. With a libretto by Keith Warner, it\u2019s a journey across the 20th century as seen through the eyes of the Jedermanns, a pair of \u201csong and dance merchants\u201d. Warner himself directs, and Lionel Friend conducts. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/2019/british-youth-opera-scoring-a-century/extras\">Peacock Theatre, WC2, Saturday 31 August, Wednesday 4, Friday 6 September</a></em></p> <h2>Nuages</h2> <p>With works by Szymanowski, Jan\u00e1\u010dek and Tchaikovsky, Ilan Volkov\u2019s programme for the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra is mostly east European. But he begins with the premiere of Nuages, a Proms commission from Linda Catlin Smith\u2013 New York-born but long resident in Canada \u2013 whose beautifully conceived, quietly evocative music has gained more and more attention in recent years. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/bbc-proms-2019/prom-58-tchaikovsky-janacek-szymanowski-and-smith/\">Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Sunday 1 September</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bb51b75fc30c5c505fafd0f5458ea81266eb326\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bb51b75fc30c5c505fafd0f5458ea81266eb326/0_0_4348_3186/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Stubbs\u2019s study for The Third Anatomical Table of the Muscles ... of the Horse (1756-1758).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"733\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Stubbs\u2019s study for The Third Anatomical Table of the Muscles ... of the Horse (1756-1758).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Royal Academy of Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>C\u00e9zanne at the Whitworth</h2> <p>The intellect and contained passion of C\u00e9zanne make him a virtually unequalled artist. The late gallerist Karsten Schubert assembled a superb collection of his works on paper, in a career that also saw him support the likes of Rachel Whiteread, and gifted these treasures to the Whitworth. This is a celebration of genius and generosity. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/upcomingexhibitions/cezanneatthewhitworth/\">The Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, to 1 March</a></em></p> <h2>Cindy Sherman</h2> <p>The artist whose face is everywhere in her work yet somehow invisible is both an extrovert and introvert. Sherman\u2019s use of disguises to reinvent her very being makes her artistic career since the late-1970s one long masquerade, in which she reveals the unstable and invented nature of the human self. Self-portraiture with a vengeance. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/blog/cindy-sherman\">National Portrait Gallery, WC2, to 15 September</a></em></p> <h2>Ed Ruscha</h2> <p>Pop art and conceptual art were both born in the 1960s and were never far apart, as the long, provocative career of Ed Ruscha proves. Ruscha\u2019s paintings are both masterpieces of deadpan contemporary observation and eerie philosophical questions that echo the surrealist humour of Magritte. This rich Artist Rooms display of his work ranges from book works and text paintings to his 2017 canvas Our Flag, which portrays the stars and stripes torn to shreds. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern/display/ed-ruscha\">Tate Modern, SE1, to 1 July</a></em></p> <h2>George Stubbs</h2> <p>The great 18th-century British painter George Stubbs was no stranger to Newmarket \u2013 some of his most perfect equine portraits are set on the flat expanse of its racecourse. Stubbs\u2019s horses are so real they are surreal, but, as this exhibition shows, he was infinitely more than a sporting artist. He got his knowledge of horses by dissecting them, and his studies of their anatomy are the most beautiful scientific drawings since Leonardo\u2019s. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.palacehousenewmarket.co.uk/visiting/stubbs-exhibition\">Palace House, Newmarket, to 28 September</a></em></p> <h2>Keith Haring</h2> <p>Pop art was reborn in 80s New York with a new taste of street and club life, and Andy Warhol played godfather to younger artists who emulated his eye for the way we live now. Keith Haring combined cartoon techniques with the scale of painting to celebrate diversity and energy. His blocky style has arguably been more influential on TV animation than it has on the art scene, so it\u2019s nice to see him back in the gallery. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/keith-haring\">Tate Liverpool, to 10 November</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b51786d64fdca5a8eefb2e2365435db83bfd13f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b51786d64fdca5a8eefb2e2365435db83bfd13f/0_71_4375_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laurie Kynaston and Amanda Abbington in The Son.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Child\u2019s play\u2026 Laurie Kynaston and Amanda Abbington in The Son.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Son</h2> <p>French playwright Florian Zeller continues his triumphant takeover of the London theatre scene. The Son (in a translation by Christopher Hampton) is the final play in Zeller\u2019s trilogy of intense domestic dramas and tackles divorce, depression and teenage life. Amanda Abbington, Laurie Kynaston, John Light and Amaka Okafor are directed by the always-astute Michael Longhurst. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.atgtickets.com/shows/the-son/duke-of-yorks-theatre/\">The Duke of York\u2019s, WC2,</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.atgtickets.com/shows/the-son/duke-of-yorks-theatre/\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.atgtickets.com/shows/the-son/duke-of-yorks-theatre/\">to 2 November</a></em></p> <h2>Typical</h2> <p>Ryan Calais Cameron\u2019s poetic and impassioned monologue draws on the death of Christopher Alder, an ex-serviceman assaulted during a night out in 1998, who was arrested and then died in police custody.

She kicks off her role as artistic director at the Bush with a revival of poet and Scottish makar Jackie Kay\u2019s 1986 play.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films The Souvenir (15) (Joanna Hogg, 2019, UK/US) 120 mins A bracing alternative to Julian Fellowes\u2019s green-welly drama of privilege, Joanna Hogg\u2019s films also deal unashamedly with first-world problems \u2013 but do so with a cooling level of dispassion that can be an acquired taste. Her latest, and possibly best, stars Honor Swinton Byrne as a film student caught up in a toxic co-dependent relationship with a secretive civil servant (Tom Burke). Bait (15) (Mark Jenkin, 2019, UK) 89 mins With his fifth feature, British director Mark Jenkin emerges from the shadows with a lo-fi indie that marks him as a talent to watch. Bait\u2019s story of inter-class tensions in gentrified Cornwall might be the currency of any social-issues drama, but Jenkin\u2019s stark style \u2013 luminous, distressed monochrome celluloid \u2013 adds a strange, hypnotic atmosphere. Pain and Glory (15) (Pedro Almod\u00f3var, 2019, Spa) 113 mins An in-depth knowledge of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s output helps to make the most of the director\u2019s most autobiographical film to date, but it\u2019s not entirely necessary. It\u2019s perfectly possible to sit back and enjoy one of Antonio Banderas\u2019s best performances, as a once-great director forced to contemplate past lives and loves as he deals with bad health, depression and addiction. Memory: The Origins of Alien (15) (Alexandre O Philippe, 2019, US) 93 mins This deep-dive into the world of Ridley Scott\u2019s haunted-house-in-space movie is not for novices; a passing acquaintance with the 1979 original won\u2019t be enough to keep up with this fast-moving, digressive doc. The making-of story is quickly dispensed with before Philippe turns his attentions to subtext, making fascinating asides on body horror, insect behaviour and class divisions on board the Nostromo. Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood (18) (Quentin Tarantino, 2019, UK/US/Chi) 161 mins The film that launched a thousand thinkpieces continues to thwart its critics \u2013 Tarantino\u2019s ninth film is now the second biggest global hit of his 27-year career. Granted, some of its stamina is due to the inspired casting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt as a Butch and Sundance-style TV star and stuntman combo, who face extinction in 1969\u2019s hippie Hollywood, and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, poster girl for the flower children. DW Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Four Tet More than 20 years into his career, Kieran Hebden, AKA Four Tet, continues to push and pull at dance music\u2019s boundaries. April\u2019s single Teenage Birdsong found him dipping back into the more blissed-out side of his musical experiments, while his recent production work on Neneh Cherry\u2019s Broken Politics album accentuated a darker hue. Expect a proper feast for the senses. Fabric, EC1, Sunday 1 September L Devine Pop upstart L Devine (her real name, Olivia Devine, was already taken by a porn star), started her career as a seven-year-old punk in a band called the Safety Pins. Eventually she switched to pop, crafting characterful, first-album-era-Charli XCX-esque bops that touch on homophobia (Daughter), a lack of sex (last single Naked Alone) and peer pressure (er, Peer Pressure). Omeara, SE1, Wednesday 4 September Serpentwithfeet Fresh from dueting with Bj\u00f6rk every night at her recent New York residency and collaborating with hip-hop rabble Brockhampton, chamber pop experimentalist Josiah Wise recently took a surprising turn by employing the services of will-this-do rent-a-guest Ty Dolla $ign on single Receipts. That the song still fits within Wise\u2019s idiosyncratic musical world is testament to his singular artistry. EartH, N16, Tuesday 3 September The Flaming Lips Conceived as the soundtrack to an \u201cimmersive head-trip fantasy experience\u201d devised by eternally grizzled frontman Wayne Coyne, the Flaming Lips\u2019 15th album, King\u2019s Mouth, continues the band\u2019s tradition for, well, being bonkers, basically. Expect lots of retina-burning visuals and perhaps another outing for Coyne\u2019s recent accessory: the eyepatch. Usher Hall, Edinburgh, Thursday 5; Manchester Academy, Friday 6; O2 Brixton Academy, SW9, 7 September MC Kefaya and Camilla George November\u2019s mammoth London jazz festival gets a summer heads-up on this day-long Docklands freebie \u2013 with former Jazz Jamaica saxophonist Camilla George weaving her postbop, Afrobeat and Caribbean influences into Kefaya\u2019s jazz, dub and Afghan folk mix (4pm), and multi-idiom international sounds from the vivacious Turbans, Cykada, Kinetika Bloco and more. Royal Albert Dock, E16, Saturday 31 August JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Bernard Haitink No conductor of our time has been a more important part of London\u2019s musical scene than Bernard Haitink. He was principal conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam for more than 25 years, but he was also chief conductor of the London Philharmonic, and then musical director of both Glyndebourne and the Royal Opera, while he has also worked with the London Symphony Orchestra. But Haitink\u2019s concert of Beethoven and Bruckner at the Proms this week with the Vienna Philharmonic will be his last here. At the age of 90, he\u2019s retiring; he\u2019ll be sorely missed. Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Tuesday 3 September Scoring a Century One of the finest new British operas of the last half-century was David Blake\u2019s Toussaint in 1977, based on the life of the Haitian revolutionary Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. Blake\u2019s most recent opera, 1999\u2019s Scoring a Century, is being staged in London for the first time by British Youth Opera. With a libretto by Keith Warner, it\u2019s a journey across the 20th century as seen through the eyes of the Jedermanns, a pair of \u201csong and dance merchants\u201d. Warner himself directs, and Lionel Friend conducts. Peacock Theatre, WC2, Saturday 31 August, Wednesday 4, Friday 6 September Nuages With works by Szymanowski, Jan\u00e1\u010dek and Tchaikovsky, Ilan Volkov\u2019s programme for the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra is mostly east European. But he begins with the premiere of Nuages, a Proms commission from Linda Catlin Smith\u2013 New York-born but long resident in Canada \u2013 whose beautifully conceived, quietly evocative music has gained more and more attention in recent years. Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Sunday 1 September AC Five of the best ... exhibitions C\u00e9zanne at the Whitworth The intellect and contained passion of C\u00e9zanne make him a virtually unequalled artist. The late gallerist Karsten Schubert assembled a superb collection of his works on paper, in a career that also saw him support the likes of Rachel Whiteread, and gifted these treasures to the Whitworth. This is a celebration of genius and generosity. The Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, to 1 March Cindy Sherman The artist whose face is everywhere in her work yet somehow invisible is both an extrovert and introvert. Sherman\u2019s use of disguises to reinvent her very being makes her artistic career since the late-1970s one long masquerade, in which she reveals the unstable and invented nature of the human self. Self-portraiture with a vengeance. National Portrait Gallery, WC2, to 15 September Ed Ruscha Pop art and conceptual art were both born in the 1960s and were never far apart, as the long, provocative career of Ed Ruscha proves. Ruscha\u2019s paintings are both masterpieces of deadpan contemporary observation and eerie philosophical questions that echo the surrealist humour of Magritte. This rich Artist Rooms display of his work ranges from book works and text paintings to his 2017 canvas Our Flag, which portrays the stars and stripes torn to shreds. Tate Modern, SE1, to 1 July George Stubbs The great 18th-century British painter George Stubbs was no stranger to Newmarket \u2013 some of his most perfect equine portraits are set on the flat expanse of its racecourse. Stubbs\u2019s horses are so real they are surreal, but, as this exhibition shows, he was infinitely more than a sporting artist. He got his knowledge of horses by dissecting them, and his studies of their anatomy are the most beautiful scientific drawings since Leonardo\u2019s. Palace House, Newmarket, to 28 September Keith Haring Pop art was reborn in 80s New York with a new taste of street and club life, and Andy Warhol played godfather to younger artists who emulated his eye for the way we live now. Keith Haring combined cartoon techniques with the scale of painting to celebrate diversity and energy. His blocky style has arguably been more influential on TV animation than it has on the art scene, so it\u2019s nice to see him back in the gallery. Tate Liverpool, to 10 November JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows The Son French playwright Florian Zeller continues his triumphant takeover of the London theatre scene. The Son (in a translation by Christopher Hampton) is the final play in Zeller\u2019s trilogy of intense domestic dramas and tackles divorce, depression and teenage life. Amanda Abbington, Laurie Kynaston, John Light and Amaka Okafor are directed by the always-astute Michael Longhurst. The Duke of York\u2019s, WC2, to 2 November Typical Ryan Calais Cameron\u2019s poetic and impassioned monologue draws on the death of Christopher Alder, an ex-serviceman assaulted during a night out in 1998, who was arrested and then died in police custody. Richard Blackwood stars in a stripped-back show that lets the facts speak for themselves. Directed by Anastasia Osei-Kuffour with unflinching purpose. Soho Theatre: Upstairs, W1, Tuesday 3 to 28 September Hedda Tessman The feminist classics are flooding the theatre scene at the moment, but this creative team is particularly tantalising. With Haydn Gwynne in the title role, Henrik Ibsen\u2019s classic play about a cosseted housewife finally breaking free is adapted by Cordelia Lynn, a writer with real vision, and the show is spearheaded by Headlong Theatre alongside Chichester Festival Theatre and the Lowry. They\u2019re bound to create a production that feels charged, unpredictable and undeniably new. Chichester Festival Theatre: Minerva Theatre, to 28 September Chiaroscuro Director Lynette Linton is on a brilliant run right now, following an excellent take on Lynn Nottage\u2019s Sweat at the Donmar and Gielgud. She kicks off her role as artistic director at the Bush with a revival of poet and Scottish makar Jackie Kay\u2019s 1986 play. The work is set at a dinner party but is a far from conventional exploration of queer and black identity, being part play, part gig, and part spoken word. The Bush Theatre, W12, Saturday 31 August to 5 October Two Trains Running Pittsburgh 1969. There\u2019s a controversial new president in the White House, and racial tensions are on the rise. American writer August Wilson\u2019s play focuses on a diner under threat of demolition and paints a vivid portrait of everyday lives at a crossroads. Two Trains Running picked up Tony awards on its Broadway debut in 1992 but is not well-known over here. Nancy Medina directs this major revival.

      "body": "<p>At the risk of alienating any weather-grumps out there, I\u2019m going to start by saying this in caps: GOD I LOVE SUMMER. I love the sun and the paddling pools and the noise from literally everyone in the world standing outside my local pub. I love people at work turning up in shorts and moaning happily about back sweat. I love constantly losing my sunglasses and looking blank when my mum tells me the names of the blooming flowers in my garden. Summer is clearly the very best of seasons. Full of joyful socialising and people actually smiling at each other.</p> <p>What I don\u2019t love, however, is this thing we all seem to do whenever the end of August arrives \u2013 that oddly British tradition where we all look at each other and go: \u201cWell then, that\u2019s summer done for another year.\u201d</p> <p>The reason this irritates me is simple: because it\u2019s not true! The season isn\u2019t over just because August is over. In fact \u2013 to paraphrase Frank Sinatra \u2013 the best month is yet to come. September should always, categorically, be included when we think of our summer months.</p> <p>September is, almost without exception, lovely. It brings its own kind of magic to the season, with glorious sunshine, but also red-golden falling leaves and long, bright, breezy days. You can still sit outside, still go barefoot in flip-flops, still enjoy a tasty early evening Grey Goose vodka cocktail. My favourite drink for those sunny September weekends was recommended to me by a bartender last year. It\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/cocktails/grey-goose-vodka/grey-goose-le-grand-fizz.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grey Goose le Grand Fizz</a> \u2013 a delightful, heady mix of Grey Goose vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, fresh lime and soda water, with ice. It\u2019s everything September-y in a glass; cool, refreshing, delicious joy. And there is nothing more perfect than sitting on a roof terrace somewhere with friends, the sound of clinking ice around you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3cd5f6df64cf4b9c3885abc8fb599deb977d9a68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cd5f6df64cf4b9c3885abc8fb599deb977d9a68/0_1353_5413_6766/800.jpg\" alt=\"Espresso martini cocktail in home setting\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An espresso martini makes a great post-dinner treat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CatLane/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I will admit, sometimes I get accused by loved ones of being cynical. A determined pessimist, one might say. But not in September. There is something about this month that draws out the optimist in me. Something new and exciting in the air that creeps in \u2013 I am happier, more inspired, and I see it in others around me, too. People are wider-eyed, refreshed, ready to take on new projects and plan new adventures. It\u2019s the time of year to begin again, to achieve, to <em>try</em>. It\u2019s an opportunity to elevate every occasion. September is when I plan my trips, it\u2019s when I arrange to see friends, it\u2019s when I date. September energises me. I feel magnetic, sociable and playful in September, I feel brave and bold. It makes me restless in a good way; twitchy for parties and spontaneous fun.</p> <p>September is a dreamy month, as well, if you prefer cosy evenings in. You\u2019re no longer under pressure to get outside for the sake of making the most of the sun. Cardigans can make a comeback from that distant, forgotten shelf in your wardrobe. The new season of telly begins, and with it all the 60-minute dramas starring Richard Madden you can handle. Plus, after months of picking at smoothies and salads, you can eat proper meals again. Pasta! Roast dinners! Potatoes! And there\u2019s nothing like an after-dinner cocktail in your garden of an early evening to top off your day. My favourite post-dinner drink is the <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/cocktails/grey-goose-vodka/espresso-martini-cocktail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grey Goose Espresso Martini</a>; with Grey Goose vodka, a single original finest quality espresso, coffee liqueur and a pinch of salted dark chocolate powder to garnish.</p> <p>And so, the campaign starts here; join me in giving September the credit it deserves. It\u2019s time to stop treating the ninth month like summer\u2019s ugly stepchild. It\u2019s time to stop drawing the blinds down on the season before we should. It\u2019s time to embrace our inner optimist and this wonderful, joyful, neverending summer.</p> <p><em>Check out some more cocktail recipes at <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/cocktails.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">greygoose.com</a></em></p> <p><em>#LiveVictoriously</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d1ff1176514ef44f484abb4b87a4e26c03b69ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d1ff1176514ef44f484abb4b87a4e26c03b69ae/0_0_620_55/500.png\" alt=\"drinkaware colour transparent\" width=\"500\" height=\"44\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",

It brings its own kind of magic to the season, with glorious sunshine, but also red-golden falling leaves and long, bright, breezy days. You can still sit outside, still go barefoot in flip-flops, still enjoy a tasty early evening Grey Goose vodka cocktail. My favourite drink for those sunny September weekends was recommended to me by a bartender last year. It\u2019s the Grey Goose le Grand Fizz \u2013 a delightful, heady mix of Grey Goose vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, fresh lime and soda water, with ice. It\u2019s everything September-y in a glass; cool, refreshing, delicious joy. And there is nothing more perfect than sitting on a roof terrace somewhere with friends, the sound of clinking ice around you. I will admit, sometimes I get accused by loved ones of being cynical. A determined pessimist, one might say. But not in September. There is something about this month that draws out the optimist in me. Something new and exciting in the air that creeps in \u2013 I am happier, more inspired, and I see it in others around me, too. People are wider-eyed, refreshed, ready to take on new projects and plan new adventures. It\u2019s the time of year to begin again, to achieve, to try. It\u2019s an opportunity to elevate every occasion. September is when I plan my trips, it\u2019s when I arrange to see friends, it\u2019s when I date. September energises me. I feel magnetic, sociable and playful in September, I feel brave and bold. It makes me restless in a good way; twitchy for parties and spontaneous fun. September is a dreamy month, as well, if you prefer cosy evenings in. You\u2019re no longer under pressure to get outside for the sake of making the most of the sun. Cardigans can make a comeback from that distant, forgotten shelf in your wardrobe. The new season of telly begins, and with it all the 60-minute dramas starring Richard Madden you can handle. Plus, after months of picking at smoothies and salads, you can eat proper meals again. Pasta! Roast dinners! Potatoes! And there\u2019s nothing like an after-dinner cocktail in your garden of an early evening to top off your day. My favourite post-dinner drink is the Grey Goose Espresso Martini; with Grey Goose vodka, a single original finest quality espresso, coffee liqueur and a pinch of salted dark chocolate powder to garnish. And so, the campaign starts here; join me in giving September the credit it deserves. It\u2019s time to stop treating the ninth month like summer\u2019s ugly stepchild. It\u2019s time to stop drawing the blinds down on the season before we should. It\u2019s time to embrace our inner optimist and this wonderful, joyful, neverending summer.

At about six inches, with egg yolk, black garlic and za\u2019atar, it was delightful, definitely decadent and punchily priced at \u00a312. Returning to Tou, I chose the tofu sando: chopped boiled egg laced with wasabi mayonnaise, spring onion and fresh coriander with two pockets of breaded, deep-fried silken tofu between brioche-like Japanese milk bread, for \u00a310.50. This feisty blend is clearly someone, somewhere\u2019s idea of a delicious sandwich, and I thoroughly respect that. This sando has graced dozens of Instagram feeds, where diners who were given it for free at the opening parties said they had an amazing, thoroughly seamless experience at this brilliant, clever new food-hall concept and that this was the greatest sandwich ever. Frankly, I don\u2019t believe them. Food: 5/10 Service: 0/10 Ambience: 0/10 Arcade Food Theatre, 103-105 New Oxford Street, London, WC1A, 020-7519 1202. arcade-london.com.

She got on a plane to meet Limi\u00f1ana and his wife, Marie, who plays drums, at their studio in Cabestany in the south of France. They recorded a song for the band\u2019s album Shadow People, with Newcombe producing. \u201cThe result was so good that he suggested we should all form a band together.\u201d</p> <p>If Seigner supplies l\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e with Hollywood star wattage, Newcombe provides the rock\u2019n\u2019roll credentials.

Fifteen years on, Newcombe has yet to watch it. </p> <p>\u201cThere are more interesting versions of the film, but a lot of the industry people didn\u2019t sign off on it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people say there\u2019s a crime element to the entertainment industry, they\u2019re not kidding. When [the record companies] were trying to sign us, it was essentially Swiss hookers coming to see us with bags of cocaine.

While Newcombe \u2013 with his straggly hair, shades and beads \u2013 still has a frazzled air, the teetotal Seigner takes pride in abstinence. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t difficult for me to avoid [drink and drugs] because I was never attracted to it,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m conservative. I\u2019d rather go running.\u201d</p> <p>What unites them is a refusal to compromise. Having waged a one-man war on the music industry, Newcombe now produces records at his Cobra studio and runs the label <a href=\"https://cargorecordsdirect.co.uk/collections/a-recordings\" title=\"\">A Recordings</a>, which has put out more than 180 releases.</p> <p>Seigner, meanwhile, turned down the chance of international stardom at 19, having starred opposite Harrison Ford in Frantic. \u201cThe head of Warner Bros really liked me and wanted me to go to Hollywood and sign a contract to do three movies,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew they were going to use me as the sexy French girl. That\u2019s not interesting to me. So I left and I lived in Ibiza for five years. I was always a rebel. I was never licking anybody\u2019s ass to make movies.\u201d</p> <p>L\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e\u2019s first single, Dreams, tells the story of a woman who responds to being harassed by a man by eating him alive. Is this Seigner\u2019s comment on the #MeToo movement?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated subject,\u201d she says. That\u2019s quite an understatement, given that, in 1978, her husband was convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl in the US. Just this week, the Venice film festival was criticised for including Polanksi\u2019s latest movie. Even the president of the festival\u2019s international jury <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/08/venice-film-festival-roman-polanski-gender-parity-quotas-debate-1202705994/\" title=\"\">said she would not be congratulating him</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a feminist,\u201d Seigner says, \u201cand I think it is very important that women have power and are paid as much as men and have the same chances and choices. I have always fought for that. But, at the same time, I don\u2019t like it when we slide into puritanism. That\u2019s a bit silly, I think, and not good for women. Of course, there has been a lot of abuse \u2013 too much \u2013 and maybe it has to go all this way to be right. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Seigner explains that she had her own experiences of sexual impropriety, having been cast by Jean-Luc Godard in D\u00e9tective at 18. \u201cI remember, on the first day, he said: \u2018Take off your T-shirt.\u2019 So I said: \u2018Yeah, OK.\u2019 On the second day, he said: \u2018You go naked.\u2019 I said: \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to go naked,\u2019 and I left. Then after I came back, a week later, he said: \u2018You won your panties.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What was her response to that? \u201cIt\u2019s life, you know. Men were always like that.\u201d</p> <p>Did she often find herself having to stand up for herself? \u201cI was always a warrior. I never took any shit from anyone, even when I was 14. Unless somebody had a knife on my neck, which never happened, thank God, I never had problems. But I guess not everybody is the same. I can\u2019t talk about other people.\u201d</p> <p>Having been married to Polanski for 30 years \u2013 the couple have two children together, Morgane and Elvis \u2013 she is frustrated by the release of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/23/quentin-tarantino-gruesome-revenge-fantasies-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood\" title=\"\">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a>, based on events surrounding the death of her husband\u2019s first wife, Sharon Tate, in 1969.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not very happy about this movie because it is very disturbing for my children,\u201d she says with a sigh. \u201cBut what can I do? Nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Seigner\u2019s loyalty to her husband saw her reject an invitation to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences \u2013 the awards body behind the Oscars \u2013 following its decision to expel Polanski.</p> <p>\u201cFor my career, it would have been much easier for me to accept it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t look at myself in the mirror [if I had].\u201d</p> <p><em>L\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e\u2019s debut album, Diabolique, is released on 6 September</em></p>",

I\u2019d rather go running.\u201d What unites them is a refusal to compromise. Having waged a one-man war on the music industry, Newcombe now produces records at his Cobra studio and runs the label A Recordings, which has put out more than 180 releases. Seigner, meanwhile, turned down the chance of international stardom at 19, having starred opposite Harrison Ford in Frantic. \u201cThe head of Warner Bros really liked me and wanted me to go to Hollywood and sign a contract to do three movies,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew they were going to use me as the sexy French girl. That\u2019s not interesting to me. So I left and I lived in Ibiza for five years. I was always a rebel. I was never licking anybody\u2019s ass to make movies.\u201d L\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e\u2019s first single, Dreams, tells the story of a woman who responds to being harassed by a man by eating him alive. Is this Seigner\u2019s comment on the #MeToo movement? \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated subject,\u201d she says. That\u2019s quite an understatement, given that, in 1978, her husband was convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl in the US. Just this week, the Venice film festival was criticised for including Polanksi\u2019s latest movie. Even the president of the festival\u2019s international jury said she would not be congratulating him. \u201cI\u2019m a feminist,\u201d Seigner says, \u201cand I think it is very important that women have power and are paid as much as men and have the same chances and choices. I have always fought for that. But, at the same time, I don\u2019t like it when we slide into puritanism. That\u2019s a bit silly, I think, and not good for women. Of course, there has been a lot of abuse \u2013 too much \u2013 and maybe it has to go all this way to be right. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Seigner explains that she had her own experiences of sexual impropriety, having been cast by Jean-Luc Godard in D\u00e9tective at 18. \u201cI remember, on the first day, he said: \u2018Take off your T-shirt.\u2019 So I said: \u2018Yeah, OK.\u2019 On the second day, he said: \u2018You go naked.\u2019 I said: \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to go naked,\u2019 and I left. Then after I came back, a week later, he said: \u2018You won your panties.\u2019\u201d What was her response to that? \u201cIt\u2019s life, you know. Men were always like that.\u201d Did she often find herself having to stand up for herself? \u201cI was always a warrior. I never took any shit from anyone, even when I was 14. Unless somebody had a knife on my neck, which never happened, thank God, I never had problems. But I guess not everybody is the same. I can\u2019t talk about other people.\u201d Having been married to Polanski for 30 years \u2013 the couple have two children together, Morgane and Elvis \u2013 she is frustrated by the release of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, based on events surrounding the death of her husband\u2019s first wife, Sharon Tate, in 1969. \u201cI\u2019m not very happy about this movie because it is very disturbing for my children,\u201d she says with a sigh. \u201cBut what can I do? Nothing.\u201d Last year, Seigner\u2019s loyalty to her husband saw her reject an invitation to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences \u2013 the awards body behind the Oscars \u2013 following its decision to expel Polanski. \u201cFor my career, it would have been much easier for me to accept it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t look at myself in the mirror [if I had].\u201d L\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e\u2019s debut album, Diabolique, is released on 6 September",

      "body": "<p>The start of our honeymoon was blissful: beaches, snorkelling and romantic restaurants on the island of Saint Kitts in the Caribbean. Clay and I met five years ago at university in Indiana, and married on 13 July this year, before a week-long holiday. Halfway through, we decided to climb Mount Liamuiga, a dormant volcano nearly 3,800ft high. We arrived at the base at 9.30am, expecting to find a visitor centre and hire a guide, but there was just a small plaque marking the start of a trail, so we set off on our own. On the way up we were surrounded by lush rainforest that made me think of Jurassic Park. There were monkeys in the canopy, occasionally dropping half-eaten mangoes. We reached the summit around noon and ate our sandwiches looking out over the ocean and surrounding islands.</p> <p>Walking along the rim of the crater, we spotted another trail leading down into the basin. It was very steep, perhaps 80 degrees in places, with ropes secured to trees and rocks to form a chain. Clay wanted to go down and take some pictures: the crater was spectacular, over half a mile across and full of vegetation. I followed him a little way, but I\u2019m very cautious and quite scared of heights, and the thought of the return journey, clambering over large boulders, was particularly scary; so Clay went on alone.</p> <p>A few minutes later I heard a noise like a branch snapping, followed by what sounded like something rolling down the mountain. I thought Clay had dislodged a rock, but when I shouted his name there was no response. Uneasy, I waited a minute and shouted again \u2013 still nothing. And then, from somewhere much further down, I heard a faint cry for help.</p> <p>Trying to suppress my panic, I scrambled down as fast as I could. Terrified of what I might find, I kept going, screaming his name. When he responded, the sound of his voice filled me with relief and concern: he sounded stricken. Finally, I spotted him. He was curled up on the ground, facing away from me; I could see blood behind his right ear and on his back. \u201cClay,\u201d I called. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Have you broken anything?\u201d He kept repeating, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My head hurts.\u201d</p> <p> The front of his shirt was covered with vomit and blood, with more blood pouring from his nose and head. He kept saying, \u201cWhere are we? What\u2019s happened?\u201d I tried both of our phones \u2013 no signal. We\u2019d only encountered one other hiker that day, and he\u2019d been heading down. I had to stay calm for Clay, but inside I was freaking out. No one knew where we were.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t leave Clay on his own, so I asked if he could walk. Amazingly, though he must have fallen 50ft, with my support he could stand. Clay is eight inches taller than me and 60lbs heavier, but I got behind him and pushed, and it took an exhausting half hour to reach the summit again. I had to keep reminding Clay where we were and what we were doing; he just wanted to lie down. Every 10 minutes or so he vomited bloodily \u2013 we would later learn blood was running down his throat from his nose, but at the time I worried he had internal injuries that could kill him. I had to push those thoughts away and focus on getting help.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/23/i-had-an-erection-for-three-weeks-experience\">Experience: I had an erection for three weeks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once we\u2019d cleared the crater the descent was easier, though Clay stumbled more frequently and leant heavily on me.

This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.</p>\n    <p>Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.</p>\n    <p>The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.</p>\n    <p>Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u2019s customs union permanently if the UK &amp; EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was added to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Joint interpretative instrument&nbsp;</b><br></p>\n    <p>A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like.

      "bodyText": "Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister has said Boris Johnson has not proposed any credible replacement for the backstop, the stumbling block to a Brexit deal. Simon Coveney, who is also Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, said: \u201cThere is no country that wants a deal more than Ireland.\u201d. But he said any agreement had to be credible, meaning it must avoid the return of a hard border and protect the EU single market. Speaking to reporters in Helsinki, Coveney said: \u201cAt the moment nothing credible has come from the British government in the context of an alternative to the backstop. If that changes, great, we will look at it in Dublin, but more importantly it can be the basis of a discussion in Brussels. \u201cBut it has got to be credible. It can\u2019t simply be this notion that \u2018look, we must have the backstop removed and we will solve this problem in the future negotiation\u2019 without any credible way of doing that.\u201d The backstop is an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and protect the all-Ireland economy. It would keep the UK in an EU customs area, until both sides agree on other arrangements. The backstop kicks in automatically, if EU and UK negotiators fail to come up with mutually acceptable alternatives during trade talks. But Grant Shapps rejected Coveney\u2019s claims that the government had failed to propose alternatives.

Everyone is there to grow their own produce and everyone has a different bit of advice on how to do it. At the end of the summer, everyone has some different veg to swap. There is never a dull time.

It was so colourful and all the money raised that day \u2013 \u00a3800 \u2013 went to the air ambulance. \u201cIt means a great deal to be able to go to my own little plot, to dig, learn about veg and nature, and be part of a community. For some allotment holders, who have had plots for 30 years, it\u2019s a way of life.\u201d Amy Dean, Burton upon Trent \u2018It means so much more than just growing food\u2019 \u201cIt means so much more than just growing our food; it means we can spend a lot of relaxing time outdoors. We connect to nature, let kids learn the value of food and get a real community feel by sharing produce.\u201d Dasha Zhurauskaya, York \u2018Making new allotment friends is great\u2019 \u201cThis is our fourth year on our plot and we can\u2019t imagine not having an allotment now. It can be hard work and time-consuming but the benefits are numerous: from growing your own fruit, veg and flowers from seed (sometimes after two or three attempts!), to the social and health aspects such as sharing and swapping plants and veg, all that fresh air in the middle of the city, finding 101 ways to cook a courgette, and discovering you quite like baking. \u201cMaking new allotment friends is great. Everyone is there to grow their own produce and everyone has a different bit of advice on how to do it. At the end of the summer, everyone has some different veg to swap. There is never a dull time. Work can be found all year round (last winter, we rebuilt our raised beds) and in all weathers. Whether you end a busy weekend on the allotment sitting on your plot with a cuppa or a beer enjoying the sunshine, or having to take cover in the shed from a sudden downpour, it\u2019s all part of the fun.\u201d John and Natalie, Eastney, Portsmouth, Hampshire \u2018A haven for wildlife\u2019 \u201cOur allotments are a place of escapism and wellbeing. A large, quiet and picturesque field on the edge of town beside the river provides a haven for wildlife and an opportunity for local residents \u2013 young, old and everywhere in between \u2013 to plant what they love and let it grow. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable space for allotment holders to exercise, socialise, share ideas, swap produce, share recipes and generally find a wealth of good feelings from the field.\u201d Louise Stedman, Sleaford, Lincolnshire And just in case this is all getting a bit too rosy, here\u2019s a more tongue in cheek take on the benefits of an allotment\u2026 \u2018Keeping slightly dysfunctional people off the streets\u2019 \u201cAn allotment is a secret micro-world in which to immerse yourself both mentally and physically. It is like a council-run holding pen to keep all the slightly dysfunctional people off the streets of Reading!\u201d John, Waterloo Meadows, Reading",

      "bodyText": "Less than 10% of sugarcane growers in Great Barrier Reef catchments are using appropriate land management practices for reef health, according to a major report that underlines the need for new regulations proposed by the Queensland government. The federal and Queensland governments\u2019 water quality report card for 2017-2018 says the condition of inshore reefs on the Great Barrier Reef has deteriorated to an overall grade of \u201cD\u201d \u2013 which means \u201cpoor\u201d. The report card was one of two major reports on the Great Barrier Reef published Friday. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s five-yearly outlook report was also released and found the reef\u2019s outlook had declined from poor to very poor and would remain so without urgent action to address the climate crisis. Poor land management practices, which contribute to degradation on the reef due to sediment and nutrient run-off, are highlighted in the report. It also looks at the condition of inshore corals, water quality and seagrasses and the adoption rates of improved agricultural practices. In addition to an overall rating of D, the report showed worsening water quality in five out of six inshore regions. The report card shows extremely low take-up rates of farming methods considered best practice for reef health across almost every area of the agriculture industry in reef regions of Queensland. The sugarcane sector was graded an \u201cE\u201d \u2013 or \u201cvery poor\u201d - overall with an adoption rate of improved farming practices of just 9.8%. The target for 2025 is 90%. The grazing, grains and horticulture sectors were each graded a \u201cD\u201d overall, while the banana industry was graded a \u201cC\u201d with an adoption rate of 64.7%. Queensland\u2019s environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, said the report showed legislation the government had introduced that will tighten regulations on agricultural run-off that flows into reef catchments was necessary. \u201cRight now, having seen these two reports, anybody who stands up and opposes the responsible reef regulations that the Palaszczuk government has brought before the parliament (is) simply dismissing the science that backs in these reports,\u201d she said. Enoch said while the report showed some improvements, it \u201csimply wasn\u2019t enough\u201d. While many farmers were doing good work, she said the uptake wasn\u2019t fast enough. \u201cThere are also a lot of scores that are poor, or very poor,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these results show why the Palaszczuk government\u2019s proposed reef regulations are needed.\u201d There has been a campaign by some farmers in Queensland against the tougher regulations that will be debated by the Queensland parliament later this year. Richard Leck, a campaigner with WWF Australia, said the data in the report card \u201cis the strongest argument\u201d for why new regulations were needed \u201cboth in terms of the impact that poor water quality is having and the adoption rates from some sections of the cane-growing industry\u201d. Imogen Zethoven, the campaign director for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the rate of progress was \u201cglacial\u201d. She said the adoption of best practice land management by some farmers was welcome but it hadn\u2019t occurred at the rate necessary to prevent further deterioration of inshore reef ecosystems that are habitat for many reef species. \u201cThis report makes it absolutely clear that regulations are needed to give the reef a fighting chance in the face of all the threats it is dealing with,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "As the constitutional battle intensifies, public services are becoming collateral damage. The Brexit frenzy, combined with preparations for a general election, has torpedoed the chances of any semblance of financial stability returning to government spending. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, will present a one-year public spending round on 4 September instead of planning for the usual three-year review. This will give departments short-term funding once the current spending plans come to an end in March 2020. In political terms, it will position the Conservatives for a general election and allow officials to concentrate on leaving the EU. There will be some pre-election largesse \u2013 some real, some sleight of hand \u2013 delivering the cash to honour pledges already made by the prime minister on policing, schools and the NHS. But austerity will be far from over, in terms of both the funding provided and the enduring damage caused by previous cuts. Housing, prisons, culture, and legal aid can expect little respite. The atrophying of the justice system, from funding the courts to the treatment of prisoners, is a scandal pushed to the margins of public policy. The relaxation of capital spending controls for the NHS makes a good headline but is of little help. Financial famine followed by a splurge of cash is no way to manage billions of pounds of healthcare assets in buildings, equipment and technology. Hospitals and the rest of the NHS need solid capital spending plans that enable them to maintain and upgrade facilities and invest in new kit. For local government, the financial instability continues. The fair funding review \u2013 expected to deliver a shift of money from urban to rural areas \u2013 was due to be implemented next April, but is now unlikely before 2021. \u201cFair\u201d is a subjective term, of course, with deprived city areas likely to be the losers. More worrying for the long-term, the whole council funding edifice is crumbling. There is near-universal agreement that the current business rate regime is unfit for an era of struggling high streets and out-of-town internet giants, but developing and implementing a solution looks years away \u2013 an issue rammed home last week by the housing, communities and local government select committee. The government plans to change the way business rates are used in the funding system, with councils retaining more of the rates and receiving less government grant, supposedly to incentivise them to spur economic growth. But the proposed system is complicated, opaque and based on highly questionable logic, and runs a severe risk of exacerbating rather than tackling economic inequalities across the country. Council tax continues to benefit the wealthy while perpetuating the farce that most bills are based on what a home was worth almost 30 years ago. Policy on council tax levels has lurched from rigid central caps on increases to encouraging above inflation rises, in order to paper over the worst of the social care crisis. Meanwhile, as the select committee MPs point out, spending on planning, development and housing has more than halved since 2010, while funding for highways, transport, cultural and leisure services is down more than 40%. This collapse will continue until there is a government with the wit and courage to find a solution to funding adult social care, which is sucking the cash out of non-statutory services. On the steps of Downing Street Boris Johnson promised to \u201cfix the crisis in social care once and for all\u201d. We\u2019ll see. Barely days into the job, Javid may be forgiven for not yet addressing problems that have festered for decades. Perhaps next year\u2019s spending review will indeed begin to offer answers. But the early signs are not promising. This government gives every indication of preferring to skate over complexity and difficulty rather than being straight with the public about the need to make hard choices to secure economic and social progress.",

Barely taller than 6ft, Walker is that increasingly rare sight in the NBA: a comparatively little point guard. But what he lacks in height and defensive ability (he has, essentially, none of the latter), he more than makes up for with a magician\u2019s bag of feints, trick dribbles, changes of direction and moments of improvisational genius. Unleash the bamboozlement.</p> <h2>Who will be the surprise team of the tournament?</h2> <p><strong>BD</strong> Nigeria have a couple of former NBA lottery picks, including Al-Farouq Aminu, who recently moved from the Portland Trail Blazers to the Orlando Magic. Josh Okogie, who will turn 21 during the tournament, burst onto the scene at Georgia Tech and impressed in his rookie year in Minnesota. The D\u2019Tigers are unbeatable in Africa when they have their full roster. In the 2016 Olympics, without Aminu, they managed to hang close with Lithuania and Spain before beating Croatia.</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> Senegal, ranked 35th in the world, will surprise not because they will win many games, but because they will hold their own against Canada (ranked 23rd), Australia (11th) and Lithuania (sixth) in this year\u2019s group of death.</p> <p><strong>BAG </strong>China have never finished better than eighth in this tournament or the Olympics, but they will benefit from rabid home support and a somewhat easy draw in Group A with Ivory Coast, Poland and Venezuela. A run to the quarter-finals behind NBA veterans Yi Jianlian and Zhou Qi is not out of the question.</p> <p><strong>AT</strong> Greece.

With a support cast drawn from the country\u2019s traditional Panathinaikos-Olympiakos basketball heartland, Greece is more than just Giannis.

      "bodyText": "What are you most looking forward to, on or off the court? Beau Dure Seeing how far Giannis Antetokounmpo can take Greece. He\u2019s surely the best player in this tournament. Greydy Diaz Several countries have NBA teammates playing alongside each other and it will be interesting to watch them build chemistry ahead of the upcoming season. Team USA leads the way with four: the Boston Celtics quartet of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Kemba Walker. Brothers Giannis and Thanasis Antetokounmpo, both of the Milwaukee Bucks, will be a force for Greece, while Serbia\u2019s roster includes Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107 and Nemanja Bjelica of the Sacramento Kings. Bryan Armen Graham The best ever finish by an African team in this tournament was Egypt\u2019s fifth-place showing way back in 1950. Nigeria appear to have the talent in place to raise that bar with five NBA players on their 12-man squad, but whether they can overcome the financial drama and player unrest that have come to the fore during the run-up remains to be seen. Aaron Timms Watching Kemba Walker, the most resourceful player in the NBA, run the show for a diminished, second-string Team USA. Barely taller than 6ft, Walker is that increasingly rare sight in the NBA: a comparatively little point guard. But what he lacks in height and defensive ability (he has, essentially, none of the latter), he more than makes up for with a magician\u2019s bag of feints, trick dribbles, changes of direction and moments of improvisational genius. Unleash the bamboozlement. Who will be the surprise team of the tournament? BD Nigeria have a couple of former NBA lottery picks, including Al-Farouq Aminu, who recently moved from the Portland Trail Blazers to the Orlando Magic. Josh Okogie, who will turn 21 during the tournament, burst onto the scene at Georgia Tech and impressed in his rookie year in Minnesota. The D\u2019Tigers are unbeatable in Africa when they have their full roster. In the 2016 Olympics, without Aminu, they managed to hang close with Lithuania and Spain before beating Croatia. GD Senegal, ranked 35th in the world, will surprise not because they will win many games, but because they will hold their own against Canada (ranked 23rd), Australia (11th) and Lithuania (sixth) in this year\u2019s group of death. BAG China have never finished better than eighth in this tournament or the Olympics, but they will benefit from rabid home support and a somewhat easy draw in Group A with Ivory Coast, Poland and Venezuela. A run to the quarter-finals behind NBA veterans Yi Jianlian and Zhou Qi is not out of the question. AT Greece. With so much of the emphasis in the build-up on the presence of the reigning NBA MVP in their ranks, it\u2019s easy to forget that the Greeks have always been solid performers at the World Cup. With a support cast drawn from the country\u2019s traditional Panathinaikos-Olympiakos basketball heartland, Greece is more than just Giannis. Players like Nick Calathes and Ioannis Bourouris are capable enough to give Greece\u2019s star man the platform he needs to dominate the tournament. The biggest threat to Team USA is ...

      "body": "<p>In the final pages of Patrick Flanery\u2019s immersive fourth novel, Helen Fairdale sits down to write a letter. It\u2019s the summer of 2016; in her youth she was an actor in Hollywood, at the beck and call of the studio system in the years after the second world war, a period of anti-communist hysteria when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/aug/09/features.features11\" title=\"\">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> wielded terrifying power. The film industry was a particular focus of the committee\u2019s investigations, culminating in the persecution of the \u201cHollywood 10\u201d, a group of writers and directors called to testify in 1947. When they refused to cooperate, the men received jail sentences and blacklistings. Helen recalls the righteous venom of those bygone days. \u201cHow could men and women in the 1940s and 1950s who believed they were doing good (as I want to believe the witch hunters did believe, whatever we thought of them then, whatever we think of them now) possibly fail to see they were doing evil?\u201d</p> <p>In this novel that evil is visited chiefly on its main narrator and protagonist, screenwriter Desmond Frank. Frank, like the book\u2019s other characters, is Flanery\u2019s invention, although a bibliography reveals the depth of the author\u2019s research into the period. \u201cThe last time I saw you was the day my life ended,\u201d runs the book\u2019s first line. Frank is recalling his Hollywood past from the distance of the present: these days he\u2019s an elderly expat living out his days in Florence with Alessio, an Italian painter many years his junior. They are more companions than lovers now, and Frank is haunted by an old lost love. It soon becomes clear that the \u201cyou\u201d to whom his recollections are addressed is his former partner Myles, a silver-screen heartthrob who enters into a <em>mariage blanc</em> with Helen in order to conceal the fact that he is gay; Helen is herself a lesbian, though her own relationship remains largely off stage. Sodomy laws made homosexuality a crime in those not-so-long-ago days; the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s diagnostic manual defined homosexuality as a sociopathic personality disturbance. Plus, it was bad for box office.</p> <p>In the Hollywood of the 40s and 50s, Frank is therefore doubly burdened: not only by his leftwing politics, but also by his sexuality. It is in this dark political atmosphere that Frank must make his way, and the novel is a reckoning of the choices he was forced to make, a gradual revelation of what would befall him and his friends and colleagues, of the price that all would finally have to pay. Flanery, an American long resident in London, is an accomplished novelist; his debut, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/16/absolution-patrick-flanery-review\" title=\"\">Absolution</a></em>, was longlisted for the Guardian first book award and the Desmond Elliott prize, and he writes with skill and conviction.</p> <p>And he isn\u2019t content with telling only one side of the story: the novel\u2019s near-700 page length allows him to range widely \u2013 perhaps too much so. Different viewpoints are interpolated in different typefaces: that of Nathalie, housekeeper to John Marsh, the director who is Frank\u2019s closest collaborator, and who appears to be a refugee from Nazi Germany; or Kay, an old friend of the director\u2019s wife. Chunks of the book are taken up with a screenplay for a film called <em>She Turned Away</em>, a vehicle for Myles written by Frank and directed by Marsh; each extract is followed by criticisms of the script from the studio\u2019s head of production, Porter Cherry, which give a chilling insight into the tenor of the times (\u201cUnder no circumstances may there be any suggestion that the Rose Zapatero character is an unwed mother\u201d). Occasionally the detail is overwhelming; a trim in the final edit would not have gone amiss.</p> <p>The script of <em>She Turned Away</em> allows Flanery to highlight the themes of betrayal, and of people forced to lead double lives, which animate the novel\u2019s prose. It is, however, somewhat too accurate in its noirish B-movie sensibility to be wholly satisfying. What might work on screen can feel clunky on the page. That said, the multilayered narratives build a claustrophobic sense of a time in which the choice to speak the truth about oneself required extraordinary courage and came at great risk. If the novel\u2019s denouement is unsurprising, that\u2019s the point: the characters are trapped by their circumstances. Reflecting on his past, Frank calls the US \u201cnothing but a nation of the unequal led by people who think they are prophets, that\u2019s what this country has always been\u201d.</p> <p>Sounds familiar?

      "body": "<p>Judy Garland was a walking ghost story. Watch footage of the patron saint of child stars from any time after The Wizard of Oz, made when she was 16, and you see a woman haunted by the girl she never had a chance to be. How that haunting ended is the subject of a new movie, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7549996/\" title=\"\">Judy</a>, starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as Garland in 1969, middle-aged in London, broke and addicted. She was doomed long before then. The details \u2013 an adolescent starlet destroyed by studio executives \u2013 remain less ghost story than horror movie.</p> <p>For generations, Garland has been a cautionary tale for kids who might venture on to the big screen. But the comfort of Judy, in theory at least, is that of a story safely in the past. How terrible the old times were; how long ago it was. Well, maybe. This summer, BBC aired the mini-series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/08/dark-money-review-a-child-abuse-drama-that-is-slight-but-full-of-horror\" title=\"\">Dark Money</a>, concerning a 13-year-old British actor abused by a Hollywood producer. The message came as a jolt, the suggestion of a film business that feeds on the young.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98t7aXRaA6w\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/98t7aXRaA6w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Did we need reminding? Brutalised child stars still appear in our films and TV shows. A few sustain robust careers: Natalie Portman is now <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/celebrities/109650932/natalie-portman-says-she-was-sexualised-as-a-child-star\" title=\"\">open in her fury</a> at the sexualisation she was put through as a teenager. Some fall but then return \u2013 how joyful to see the Netflix series Russian Doll after its star and co-creator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/21/natasha-lyonne-theres-a-fighter-in-me-orange-is-the-new-black-netflix\" title=\"\">Natasha Lyonne</a> went missing for years. For others, the comeback is pending. In the next episode of the Terminator franchise, Lyonne\u2019s 90s boyfriend Edward Furlong is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/19/edward-furlong-terminator-dark-fate-tim-miller-james-cameron-arnold-schwarzenegger-linda-hamilton\" title=\"\">due to reprise</a> his role in the series that he first starred in at 14, decades of substance abuse and legal problems between (including charges of domestic violence).</p> <p>Some no longer get involved. Given to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IncredibleCulk/status/1159215737006804993\" title=\"\">wryly mocking</a> rumoured reboots of Home Alone, Macaulay Culkin is now, in effect, in retirement in Paris, the consensus being that here is someone doing OK under the circumstances. Generally doing less well is Lindsay Lohan. And then there are the disappeared. Had they lived, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/brittany-murphy\" title=\"\">Brittany Murphy</a> would now be 41, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/11/corey-haim-obituary\" title=\"\">Corey Haim</a>, 47, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/25/the-untold-story-of-lost-star-river-phoenix-25-years-after-his-death\" title=\"\">River Phoenix</a>, 49.</p> <p>Marbled through cinema history are the same awful stories, of girls bullied, as Garland was, into self-loathing; child actors of both sexes abused and commodified. As adults, they become punchlines. The executives are elsewhere by then. In the era of #MeToo, we have got used to the uneasy reappraisal of our favourite movies in light of their full backstories. A similar impulse kicks in with child stars. How comfortably can we watch the films of Tatum O\u2019Neal or Drew Barrymore, working hard not to dwell on how many responsible adults saw them plunge into rehab?</p> <p>But then, where would the movies be without ET or Clueless or The Wizard of Oz? We always need the kind of films that need child actors. Recently, there has been the glorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-florida-project\" title=\"\">The Florida Project</a>, the director Sean Baker\u2019s bittersweet portrait of life in the budget motels next to Disney World, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/21/brooklynn-prince-florida-project-girl-heard-could-swear\" title=\"\">Brooklynn Prince</a>, six when it was filmed. For the hard-to-shake <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/room-review-brie-larson-shines-in-a-dark-dungeon\" title=\"\">Room</a> \u2013 with a boy and his mother held captive by a sociopath \u2013 Lenny Abrahamson cast seven-year-old Jacob Tremblay. Both directors aimed to make their movies ethically, a film-making spin on the Hippocratic oath, \u201cfirst, do no harm\u201d.</p> <p>Abrahamson emails from his Dublin office. There was, he writes, a commitment to \u201cbest practice. I wanted the experience to be a good and happy one for the young actor at the centre of the story.\u201d</p> <p>For Baker, speaking on the phone from Vancouver, old Hollywood loomed large. \u201cI was incredibly aware of the unhappy history of child stars. So we went into the film very cautiously.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de9e575e0cccdd0a549b9ecc660d129a3502e520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de9e575e0cccdd0a549b9ecc660d129a3502e520/0_372_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Furlong, who will reprise his childhood role of John Connor, after years of substance abuse and legal problems.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Furlong, who will reprise his childhood role of John Connor, after years of substance abuse and legal problems.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Bank/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Children in movies are so routine, you have to sometimes take a second to remember how flatly weird it is that, in this one corner of life, they exist in adult workplaces \u2013 which all film sets are. In any other context, it would be the stuff of comedy (or child labour outrages), building sites filled with schoolkids, pre-teens in meeting rooms on swivel chairs.</p> <p>The formal response has been regulatory: limits on working hours, constraints on the kind of scenes they appear in. But regulation only goes so far. The British casting director <a href=\"http://shaheenbaigcasting.com/\" title=\"\">Shaheen Baig</a> has spent much of her career working with child actors, including on early roles for Jamie Bell and Tom Holland. \u201cProductions are good at covering themselves legally,\u201d she says, \u201cbut doing the right thing needs something else. Hiring people to work with kids who actually like kids should be a given, but it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>One problem is that a first step on set tends not to lead to a creative magic kingdom, but fraught commercial reality. At auditions, a film-maker is desperate for the face who could make or break their project. Traditionally, there is little chance for reflection on how they might handle the next 20 years. Baig says that psychological assessments of child actors are sometimes carried out in British TV, but mostly to mitigate sensitive subject matter. Abrahamson spent considerable time with Tremblay before shooting Room, until he was satisfied that Tremblay would at least find <em>this</em> film healthy and rewarding. \u201cThe bigger question of whether a child will benefit long-term from being in films is largely unanswerable.\u201d</p> <p>Baker made efforts to de-stress the set of The Florida Project. \u201cWe would make a point of saying: \u2018This is not what you have to do in life. This can just be one fun summer.\u2019\u201d Yet for many the stakes start high. Some kids may be having fun. Others are grim-facedly launching careers. The role of Disney World in The Florida Project was poignant, the corporation long acting as a juvenile production line from which Ryan Gosling (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/09/ryan-gosling-directing-lost-river-interview\" title=\"\">Mouseketeer 1993-1995</a>) is just one graduate. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya\" title=\"\">Zendaya</a>, star of the wildly successful Gen Z series Euphoria, got her break at 13 on the Disney Channel sitcom Shake It Up.</p> <p>Economics matter. Gosling, raised in a single parent family, has talked of his headstart as a financial godsend. But the role of parents in the story of the child star can be complex, arranged on a spectrum with loving support at one end and pathology the other.</p> <p>Dark Money hinted at an abyss beneath the film business. More common problems are in plain sight. Culkin used a rare interview on actor <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-883-macaulay-culkin-cameron-esposito\" title=\"\">Marc Maron\u2019s podcast, WTF, last year</a> to defend his childhood friendship with Michael Jackson \u2013 he also offered to show Maron the scars left by his father, Kit. Parents require as much scrutiny in auditions as children. \u201cIf I feel the success of the child is more important to them than the continuation of a good childhood,\u201d Abrahamson says, \u201cI would not feel comfortable casting the kid.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever drives a child to start acting, it can leave them deeply vulnerable. Money explains a lot of adult cruelties \u2013 Garland was <a href=\"https://timeline.com/hollywood-drugs-1930s-6b27a1404552?gi=1255be775347\" title=\"\">fed amphetamines</a> by MGM to keep her clocking up 72-hour shifts \u2013 but even money is sometimes just a veil for other motives.</p> <p>The film-maker relies on everyday solutions \u2013 to use talent agencies with spotless reputations; to talk and talk again to parents. Baig proposes a checklist touching in its simplicity \u2013 let children know if they haven\u2019t got through an audition; ensure those who do understand it might never happen again; have someone checking teenage actors are eating properly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t disappear on them after the film comes out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4161c18de02bdee2ee0372afa21b648bc58ddf03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4161c18de02bdee2ee0372afa21b648bc58ddf03/0_0_3504_2628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brooklynn Prince in The Florida Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brooklynn Prince in The Florida Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Freestyle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abrahamson is unsure if the movies have reformed. \u201cWhere there are power imbalances, the danger of abuse will always be there.\u201d But, he says, #MeToo has made toxic behaviour of all kinds less acceptable. I ask if he would let his own children act in films. One already wants to, he replies. \u201cLike any sane parent, that scares me. But I will support her.\u201d</p> <p>Prince and Tremblay have been busy since their breakthroughs. Prince, nine this year, is to star in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Before_Dark_(film)\" title=\"\">Home Before Dark</a>, the new Apple series about the real-life pre-teen news reporter Hilde Lysiak. Tremblay, 12, can be seen in the Seth Rogen-produced comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/14/good-boys-review-gene-stupnitsky-jacob-tremblay\" title=\"\">Good Boys</a>. Abrahamson admires Tremblay\u2019s parents: \u201cDown to earth, in no way pushy.\u201d He also acknowledges the fame the actor already has may one day need unravelling. \u201cThere\u2019s no before, no normal bit to compare to.\u201d</p> <p>Baker and the Princes have kept in touch. He is painstakingly respectful of their choices, fractionally anxious at the scale of their daughter\u2019s career. \u201cMy concern for any child is that they are mixing with other kids, but I know the family are aware of the hazards around child stars, and battle those, and keep her socially connected.\u201d</p> <p>He says that, at the height of the 2018 awards season, with The Florida Project in contention for prizes, he saw Prince and Tremblay together at an industry party. They were passing among the adult guests, stopping to chat and sparkle. \u201cAlmost mingling.\u201d They looked, he thought, like adults in miniature. \u201cAnd it was cute and fun and they were playing it up. But it also made me hope that it was temporary, that it wouldn\u2019t become a regular thing. Because it\u2019s not a regular thing. And they aren\u2019t really adults.\u201d</p> <p><em>Judy premieres on 31 August and opens in the US on 27 September, in the UK on 4 October and in Australia on 10 October</em></p>",

Watch footage of the patron saint of child stars from any time after The Wizard of Oz, made when she was 16, and you see a woman haunted by the girl she never had a chance to be. How that haunting ended is the subject of a new movie, Judy, starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as Garland in 1969, middle-aged in London, broke and addicted. She was doomed long before then. The details \u2013 an adolescent starlet destroyed by studio executives \u2013 remain less ghost story than horror movie. For generations, Garland has been a cautionary tale for kids who might venture on to the big screen. But the comfort of Judy, in theory at least, is that of a story safely in the past. How terrible the old times were; how long ago it was. Well, maybe. This summer, BBC aired the mini-series Dark Money, concerning a 13-year-old British actor abused by a Hollywood producer. The message came as a jolt, the suggestion of a film business that feeds on the young. Did we need reminding? Brutalised child stars still appear in our films and TV shows. A few sustain robust careers: Natalie Portman is now open in her fury at the sexualisation she was put through as a teenager. Some fall but then return \u2013 how joyful to see the Netflix series Russian Doll after its star and co-creator Natasha Lyonne went missing for years. For others, the comeback is pending. In the next episode of the Terminator franchise, Lyonne\u2019s 90s boyfriend Edward Furlong is due to reprise his role in the series that he first starred in at 14, decades of substance abuse and legal problems between (including charges of domestic violence). Some no longer get involved. Given to wryly mocking rumoured reboots of Home Alone, Macaulay Culkin is now, in effect, in retirement in Paris, the consensus being that here is someone doing OK under the circumstances. Generally doing less well is Lindsay Lohan. And then there are the disappeared. Had they lived, Brittany Murphy would now be 41, Corey Haim, 47, and River Phoenix, 49. Marbled through cinema history are the same awful stories, of girls bullied, as Garland was, into self-loathing; child actors of both sexes abused and commodified. As adults, they become punchlines. The executives are elsewhere by then. In the era of #MeToo, we have got used to the uneasy reappraisal of our favourite movies in light of their full backstories. A similar impulse kicks in with child stars. How comfortably can we watch the films of Tatum O\u2019Neal or Drew Barrymore, working hard not to dwell on how many responsible adults saw them plunge into rehab? But then, where would the movies be without ET or Clueless or The Wizard of Oz? We always need the kind of films that need child actors. Recently, there has been the glorious The Florida Project, the director Sean Baker\u2019s bittersweet portrait of life in the budget motels next to Disney World, starring Brooklynn Prince, six when it was filmed. For the hard-to-shake Room \u2013 with a boy and his mother held captive by a sociopath \u2013 Lenny Abrahamson cast seven-year-old Jacob Tremblay. Both directors aimed to make their movies ethically, a film-making spin on the Hippocratic oath, \u201cfirst, do no harm\u201d. Abrahamson emails from his Dublin office. There was, he writes, a commitment to \u201cbest practice. I wanted the experience to be a good and happy one for the young actor at the centre of the story.\u201d For Baker, speaking on the phone from Vancouver, old Hollywood loomed large. \u201cI was incredibly aware of the unhappy history of child stars. So we went into the film very cautiously.\u201d Children in movies are so routine, you have to sometimes take a second to remember how flatly weird it is that, in this one corner of life, they exist in adult workplaces \u2013 which all film sets are. In any other context, it would be the stuff of comedy (or child labour outrages), building sites filled with schoolkids, pre-teens in meeting rooms on swivel chairs. The formal response has been regulatory: limits on working hours, constraints on the kind of scenes they appear in. But regulation only goes so far. The British casting director Shaheen Baig has spent much of her career working with child actors, including on early roles for Jamie Bell and Tom Holland. \u201cProductions are good at covering themselves legally,\u201d she says, \u201cbut doing the right thing needs something else. Hiring people to work with kids who actually like kids should be a given, but it isn\u2019t.\u201d One problem is that a first step on set tends not to lead to a creative magic kingdom, but fraught commercial reality. At auditions, a film-maker is desperate for the face who could make or break their project. Traditionally, there is little chance for reflection on how they might handle the next 20 years. Baig says that psychological assessments of child actors are sometimes carried out in British TV, but mostly to mitigate sensitive subject matter. Abrahamson spent considerable time with Tremblay before shooting Room, until he was satisfied that Tremblay would at least find this film healthy and rewarding. \u201cThe bigger question of whether a child will benefit long-term from being in films is largely unanswerable.\u201d Baker made efforts to de-stress the set of The Florida Project. \u201cWe would make a point of saying: \u2018This is not what you have to do in life. This can just be one fun summer.\u2019\u201d Yet for many the stakes start high. Some kids may be having fun. Others are grim-facedly launching careers. The role of Disney World in The Florida Project was poignant, the corporation long acting as a juvenile production line from which Ryan Gosling (Mouseketeer 1993-1995) is just one graduate. Zendaya, star of the wildly successful Gen Z series Euphoria, got her break at 13 on the Disney Channel sitcom Shake It Up. Economics matter. Gosling, raised in a single parent family, has talked of his headstart as a financial godsend. But the role of parents in the story of the child star can be complex, arranged on a spectrum with loving support at one end and pathology the other. Dark Money hinted at an abyss beneath the film business. More common problems are in plain sight. Culkin used a rare interview on actor Marc Maron\u2019s podcast, WTF, last year to defend his childhood friendship with Michael Jackson \u2013 he also offered to show Maron the scars left by his father, Kit. Parents require as much scrutiny in auditions as children. \u201cIf I feel the success of the child is more important to them than the continuation of a good childhood,\u201d Abrahamson says, \u201cI would not feel comfortable casting the kid.\u201d Whatever drives a child to start acting, it can leave them deeply vulnerable. Money explains a lot of adult cruelties \u2013 Garland was fed amphetamines by MGM to keep her clocking up 72-hour shifts \u2013 but even money is sometimes just a veil for other motives. The film-maker relies on everyday solutions \u2013 to use talent agencies with spotless reputations; to talk and talk again to parents. Baig proposes a checklist touching in its simplicity \u2013 let children know if they haven\u2019t got through an audition; ensure those who do understand it might never happen again; have someone checking teenage actors are eating properly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t disappear on them after the film comes out.\u201d Abrahamson is unsure if the movies have reformed. \u201cWhere there are power imbalances, the danger of abuse will always be there.\u201d But, he says, #MeToo has made toxic behaviour of all kinds less acceptable. I ask if he would let his own children act in films. One already wants to, he replies. \u201cLike any sane parent, that scares me. But I will support her.\u201d Prince and Tremblay have been busy since their breakthroughs. Prince, nine this year, is to star in Home Before Dark, the new Apple series about the real-life pre-teen news reporter Hilde Lysiak. Tremblay, 12, can be seen in the Seth Rogen-produced comedy Good Boys. Abrahamson admires Tremblay\u2019s parents: \u201cDown to earth, in no way pushy.\u201d He also acknowledges the fame the actor already has may one day need unravelling. \u201cThere\u2019s no before, no normal bit to compare to.\u201d Baker and the Princes have kept in touch. He is painstakingly respectful of their choices, fractionally anxious at the scale of their daughter\u2019s career. \u201cMy concern for any child is that they are mixing with other kids, but I know the family are aware of the hazards around child stars, and battle those, and keep her socially connected.\u201d He says that, at the height of the 2018 awards season, with The Florida Project in contention for prizes, he saw Prince and Tremblay together at an industry party. They were passing among the adult guests, stopping to chat and sparkle. \u201cAlmost mingling.\u201d They looked, he thought, like adults in miniature. \u201cAnd it was cute and fun and they were playing it up. But it also made me hope that it was temporary, that it wouldn\u2019t become a regular thing. Because it\u2019s not a regular thing. And they aren\u2019t really adults.\u201d Judy premieres on 31 August and opens in the US on 27 September, in the UK on 4 October and in Australia on 10 October",

The Metropolitan police said three men aged 29, 34 and 39 were detained in connection with the incident after attending a police station in north London. The force said the three were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and assault occasioning actual bodily harm and were in custody. Scotland Yard said they had been bailed until late September and that a file had been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. Jones, 35, was celebrating his birthday with friends at the time of the incident. The attack was condemned by the Guardian editor, Katharine Viner, and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. After the incident, Jones thanked his friends \u201cwho were assaulted defending me and who I love very much\u201d. The Met said: \u201cAt around 0200hrs on Saturday 17 August, a man aged in his 30s was approached outside the Lexington public house on Pentonville Road, N1. \u201cThe man was assaulted by four male suspects. When the victim\u2019s friends attempted to intervene, they were also assaulted. None of those injured required hospital treatment or London ambulance service.\u201d",

Wong\u2019s name became known in 2012 when, at 15, he organised the protests against the national education curriculum. The curriculum was seen as an attempt at instilling patriotism in Hong Kong\u2019s youth, but described as \u201cbrainwashing\u201d by Wong and his supporters. He was one of the leaders of the Umbrella Movement, in 2014 \u2013 for which he served time in jail, and is still facing a number of charges. Among the Umbrella Movement\u2019s leaders was Agnes Chow: she, too, was arrested on Friday. Wong and Chow are the co-founders of the political party Demosisto, which, like Chan\u2019s Hong Kong National party, is one of the organisations that emerged from the Umbrella Movement. </p> \n<p>None of them have had a high profile in the current political strife \u2013 it is a leaderless movement that has assumed as one of its recognisable slogans Bruce Lee\u2019s motto of \u201cbeing water\u201d: adaptable, and mobile.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/30/hong-kong-pro-democracy-leader-joshua-wong-arrested-says-demosisto\">Hong Kong protests: Joshua Wong and other pro-democracy figures arrested</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Commentators have been trying to find a good label to give to the protests that have been rocking Hong Kong all summer: umbrellas play a less important role than they did in 2014, even if they are still visible as a protective tool against the weather, tear gas, and unwelcome photographs or security cameras.</p> \n<p>Some tried to baptise this the Hard Hat Revolution: things have become a lot more violent on the ground in Hong Kong, with the police routinely firing multiple rounds of tear gas, as well as beanbags rounds, rubber bullets, sponge grenades.

In recent decades, such occasions have been rare in the policing of public unrest: it was almost half a century ago that Hong Kong saw shootings by colonial police trying to restore calm in the territory after the leftist riots of 1967, a spillover of the Chinese Cultural Revolution across the then British territory.

Women\u2019s lives were transformed, she found, but the men they shared their homes with were stubbornly unchanging in their habits. So, as men were clocking off and chilling out, their wives and girlfriends were clocking back in for an evening of domestic duty: the cooking and the cleaning, the laundry and the to-do lists, the shopping and the shuttling between childminder and swimming classes. The situation remains the same today. In effect, women in employment are pulling double shifts, and their unpaid labour is subsidising the men who live with them \u2013 or rather, live off them.</p> <p>Molly, the American suburban mother at the centre of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/literary-mixtapes-by-electric-literature/2016/jun/15/literary-mixtape-helen-phillips-shares-the-18-songs-behind-her-18-stories\" title=\"\">Helen Phillips\u2019</a>s novel, hasn\u2019t read Hochschild, but then she doesn\u2019t have time. She\u2019s got a small daughter called Viv and a baby called Ben; a job as a palaeobotanist at a site called the Pit, which turns up plant fossils mystifyingly not quite like anything else in the record; a ceaseless rota of expressing milk so she can keep up the breastfeeds; and a husband whose work takes him away from home for weeks at a time. She is tired \u2013 so tired, and so anxious for her children\u2019s safety that she can hardly trust her own senses.</p> <p>She suffers \u201cminor disorientations \u2026 small errors of eyes and ears \u2026 The conviction that there was something somehow off about a piece of litter found amid the fossils in the Pit at work.\u201d When we meet her, Molly is cowering in her bedroom with her children, certain that there is an intruder in the house, and simultaneously certain that she\u2019s in the grip of one of her delusions. From the first page, Phillips is writing in several registers of horror at the same time: it\u2019s a juggling act as awe-inspiring as watching a harassed mother pump milk while answering work emails while responding to a nagging toddler.</p> <p>The terror of the home invasion is perfectly vivid, and so is the disturbing prospect that we\u2019re embedded in the consciousness of a woman who is dangerously split off from reality. Phillips can conjure pure nightmare in a single sentence as she narrates Molly\u2019s thought processes: \u201cHer desperation for her children\u2019s silence manifested as a suffocating force, the desire for a pillow, a thick pair of socks, anything she could shove into them to perfect their muteness and save their lives.\u201d It\u2019s a line that chills not just through the violence it implies, but also because of the proximity of annihilation to love.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"892e537415873704c9f19183f40019a22a6ec060\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/892e537415873704c9f19183f40019a22a6ec060/625_36_2385_2095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Phillips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"878\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Phillips</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Molly, we soon learn, is right to believe there\u2019s something trespassing in her house. The thing she\u2019s hiding from turns out to be at once totally sinister and entirely familiar: both an answer to the ravening demands of her family, and something with frightening needs of its own.

      "bodyText": "When women entered the workforce en masse in the 1980s, sociologist Arlie Hochschild called it the \u201csecond shift\u201d. Women\u2019s lives were transformed, she found, but the men they shared their homes with were stubbornly unchanging in their habits. So, as men were clocking off and chilling out, their wives and girlfriends were clocking back in for an evening of domestic duty: the cooking and the cleaning, the laundry and the to-do lists, the shopping and the shuttling between childminder and swimming classes. The situation remains the same today. In effect, women in employment are pulling double shifts, and their unpaid labour is subsidising the men who live with them \u2013 or rather, live off them. Molly, the American suburban mother at the centre of Helen Phillips\u2019s novel, hasn\u2019t read Hochschild, but then she doesn\u2019t have time. She\u2019s got a small daughter called Viv and a baby called Ben; a job as a palaeobotanist at a site called the Pit, which turns up plant fossils mystifyingly not quite like anything else in the record; a ceaseless rota of expressing milk so she can keep up the breastfeeds; and a husband whose work takes him away from home for weeks at a time. She is tired \u2013 so tired, and so anxious for her children\u2019s safety that she can hardly trust her own senses. She suffers \u201cminor disorientations \u2026 small errors of eyes and ears \u2026 The conviction that there was something somehow off about a piece of litter found amid the fossils in the Pit at work.\u201d When we meet her, Molly is cowering in her bedroom with her children, certain that there is an intruder in the house, and simultaneously certain that she\u2019s in the grip of one of her delusions. From the first page, Phillips is writing in several registers of horror at the same time: it\u2019s a juggling act as awe-inspiring as watching a harassed mother pump milk while answering work emails while responding to a nagging toddler. The terror of the home invasion is perfectly vivid, and so is the disturbing prospect that we\u2019re embedded in the consciousness of a woman who is dangerously split off from reality. Phillips can conjure pure nightmare in a single sentence as she narrates Molly\u2019s thought processes: \u201cHer desperation for her children\u2019s silence manifested as a suffocating force, the desire for a pillow, a thick pair of socks, anything she could shove into them to perfect their muteness and save their lives.\u201d It\u2019s a line that chills not just through the violence it implies, but also because of the proximity of annihilation to love. Yet Molly, we soon learn, is right to believe there\u2019s something trespassing in her house. The thing she\u2019s hiding from turns out to be at once totally sinister and entirely familiar: both an answer to the ravening demands of her family, and something with frightening needs of its own. She\u2019s right, too, about the trash she\u2019s found in the Pit, which attracts coachloads of curious tourists when it is put on display. There\u2019s a Coke bottle with the script of the logo leaning left rather than right; a toy soldier with an undeniable monkey tail; and most compelling of all, a Bible where the \u201cdivine pronoun\u201d is She rather than He throughout. These are objects that are not quite evil but definitely creepy, and Phillips revels in the ambivalence of her imagination: in genre terms, The Need belongs to the HP Lovecraft-revisiting tradition of the New Weird, where incomprehensible phenomena lead into the realms of the terrible and sublime. Like short-story writers Kristen Roupenian in You Know You Want This and Mariana Enr\u00edquez in Things We Lost in the Fire, Phillips revitalises horror tropes by running them through a female point of view. There\u2019s beauty, too: Molly feels her dread casts \u201cthe light of the sacred upon the mundane\u201d, and Phillips\u2019s attentive, unsentimental observations of Molly\u2019s threatened domesticity catch at the heart. Thrillingly disturbing, frighteningly insightful about motherhood and love, and spilling over with offhand invention, The Need is one of this year\u2019s most necessary novels. \u2022 The Need is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a316.99).

For me, it is a kind of fundamentalism: a drawing should be colourless.</p> <p>But Lisboa has never a city in aquatint.</p> <p>There is something dazzling in her light that requires brighter media. The wide estuary in the south, multiple buildings dressed in <em>azulejos </em>(bright ceramic tiles), and dazzling white stone pavements that mirror an intense extra light, illuminating even the darker shadows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9658e379e846aaa547562a9b49a7e7850cd1de59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9658e379e846aaa547562a9b49a7e7850cd1de59/0_0_6451_4861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisbon airport, Terminal 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisbon airport, Terminal 1</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Eduardo C\u00f4rte-Real/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But over the past 10 years, this bright, beautiful city has attracted worldwide interest \u2013 and tourism has increased exponentially.

The tourists who stay here, like the silk, combs, and ceramics once produced in the buildings around the square, descend every morning to the city centre, waiting to be shipped back to their original places.</p> <p>On one of the square\u2019s sides, a giant aqueduct built in the 1740s ends in the first great reservoir of the water distribution system. <em>Ma\u0303e de A\u0301gua</em> (Mother of Water) provided reliable water for all the factories\u2019 needs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b83739e76ed8676e638e1a69c36e81b5d3cb54d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b83739e76ed8676e638e1a69c36e81b5d3cb54d/0_0_3379_3278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rua S.

Twenty years ago it was possible for a middle class family to buy an apartment here. Since then, the prices have more than quadrupled in the area (the most rapid price increase has happened in the past five years). Short term rental companies buy apartments or entice owners to let theirs out. More and more homes are passing out of the normal long term renting market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f38aa7d24f0bb89332be3aeaaa91934252c9b38d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f38aa7d24f0bb89332be3aeaaa91934252c9b38d/0_0_6794_4884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ma\u0303e d\u2019 A\u0301gua reservoir.

Its purpose was to contain water but, for some glorious reason, they decided to give it architectural significance. From the outside, it looks very plain (itself a miracle during those rococo years) but inside it is breathtaking. I teach at a design school, which since 1996 has been based in a building built on the site of the old Santos dock. So every day, I roll down Sa\u0303o Bento street just like a crate of combs did in 1780.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"550e4dfb388aa0de7719078f9ab7974a8d9bf8f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/550e4dfb388aa0de7719078f9ab7974a8d9bf8f7/0_0_6935_5064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indoor swimming pool, Clube Nacional de Natac\u0327a\u0303o, Rua de S.

The club used to have an open air swimming pool, which was the only place to swim in the old city centre from 1930s to the 2000s, but it is now covered by padel courts (a strange imprisoned tennis that apparently only Spaniards and Portuguese play). The prime minister\u2019s official residence is nearby, and legend has it that Salazar, Portugal\u2019s dictator between 1936 and 1968, was often annoyed by the joyful screams of children playing in the water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0ac43e489b883c9a86eedd1a391d50af6422498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0ac43e489b883c9a86eedd1a391d50af6422498/0_0_4555_4870/935.jpg\" alt=\"Pala\u0301cio Chiado, Rua do Alecrim, Chiado\" width=\"935\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pala\u0301cio Chiado, Rua do Alecrim, Chiado</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Eduardo C\u00f4rte-Real/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The school where I teach was originally in a palace in Chiado, very close to Largo de Camo\u0303es. The palace has had several tenants, the most famous of whom was General Junot, who conquered Portugal on behalf of Napoleon in the first French invasion. From the main balcony in the palace he could see the Cais do Sodre\u0301 docks, from where the royal family fled to Brazil escorted by British warships. Junot stayed only until August 1808 when his army was defeated. Later, bored in Paris, Madame Junot complained in her writings that she missed Lisbon\u2019s light and delicious fruit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e677b9fa7d5964361c551ea281cb4dbf6a6723e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e677b9fa7d5964361c551ea281cb4dbf6a6723e/0_0_6647_4851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Junot Bar in Pala\u0301cio Chiado\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Junot Bar in Pala\u0301cio Chiado</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Eduardo C\u00f4rte-Real/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We used to hold life drawing classes in a room called \u201cSala Romana\u201d where the battles between the Romans and the Sabines are frescoed on the walls. The frescoes were finished in 1822, and the artist depicted himself at the age of 25. In 1878 he restored his own paintings and, despite having the option to update his image, chose to keep it as it was 56 years earlier.</p> <p>The school left the building in 2013. These days, the rooms where once Madame Junot rejoiced in the taste of a succulent peach and so many generations of students struggled with art history and human anatomy are a gourmet restaurant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f4d09e4dc50e117471270fbb0c896a8083d6958\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f4d09e4dc50e117471270fbb0c896a8083d6958/0_0_6626_4730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"IADE building, Avenida D.

In 1979, the building where the school now functions was built, designed by a famous preposterous-modernist architect Toma\u0301s Taveira, emulating the steel language of cranes and port facilities. For almost 20 years, it stayed empty and unsellable. When it was acquired in 1996, little by little the surroundings changed, pushed by nearly 1,800 students and 200 faculty staff who come and go daily every academic year. Now it is a trendy area also populated by other art and design schools, the headquarters of a major power company, plus stylish law-firms and tech companies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5479dafd8b4d94b9ca59d23e6c6b8b01ee566dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5479dafd8b4d94b9ca59d23e6c6b8b01ee566dc/0_0_7017_5074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pizzeria Uma Pizza em Companhia, Rua da Silva, Conde Bara\u0303o\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pizzeria Uma Pizza em Companhia, Rua da Silva, Conde Bara\u0303o</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Eduardo C\u00f4rte-Real/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is now a place of \u201cfood projects\u201d, regional or political, from France to Mexico to Thailand. One of my favourites is a pizzeria owned by a young Italian couple who, like many, coasted here because of surf and a sort of Californian flair. These restaurants thrive on the hesitations of tourists regarding <em>polvo a\u0300 lagareiro, alheiras, bacalhau a\u0300 gomes de sa\u0301, bitoques </em>and other enigmatic Portuguese menu items, offering the reassurance of universal pizza, French cuisine and burgers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46d317dcb285e4acb9418ba1f67db7f454741b39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46d317dcb285e4acb9418ba1f67db7f454741b39/0_0_709_771/460.jpg\" alt=\"Docearte, a CCB cafe devoted to Bonbons, Bele\u0301m\" width=\"460\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Docearte, a CCB cafe devoted to Bonbons, Bele\u0301m</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Eduardo C\u00f4rte-Real/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our life drawing classes also take us out and about in the city. For perspective and landscape, we work in Centro Cultural de Bele\u0301m \u2013 CCB. It is a place with an intense cultural program, auditoriums, several conference rooms, art galleries and lots of fancy commerce. Museum Berardo, also lodged here, holds a remarkable collection of modern art. The building is a compound with streets and squares dominated by a strict modularity and orthogonal organisation making it perfect for understanding perspective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"829308bb87d0ba2fee22b8f91feec776ef82f24f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/829308bb87d0ba2fee22b8f91feec776ef82f24f/0_0_6033_5006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jardim das Oliveiras, CCB, Bele\u0301m\" width=\"1000\" height=\"830\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jardim das Oliveiras, CCB, Bele\u0301m</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Eduardo C\u00f4rte-Real/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inside the CCB compound is the appealing Jardim das Oliveiras, a platform garden terrace facing the river.

It holds the King Carlos I oceanographic collection of specimens, gathered and preserved in pristine flasks, as well as models of bigger marine beasts. On the lower floor we are poltergeisted by several small tanks with remarkable live fish, which the students use for movement studies. The star, however, is a giant squid, resting in a vitrine coffin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ee6eecb2a6ed122645d34d11395d4f54c248047\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ee6eecb2a6ed122645d34d11395d4f54c248047/0_0_6193_4939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rua da Academia das Cie\u0302ncias, Pri\u0301ncipe Real\" width=\"1000\" height=\"798\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rua da Academia das Cie\u0302ncias, Pri\u0301ncipe Real</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Eduardo C\u00f4rte-Real/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another place we usually visit for drawing sessions is the Museu Geolo\u0301gico in Rua da Academia das Cie\u0302ncias. The museum is housed in the same building that hosts the Academy. This is probably one of the loveliest street in Lisbon. On one side the gardens of almost Edwardian houses jut over garages, and on the other side stands the unassuming Academy fac\u0327ade and restrained working-class houses. The street ends in a narrow passageway to Rua do Se\u0301culo (also a candidate for loveliest street) crowned by a photogenic arch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34ecc30cc0697ae888bd339c00c28b1915f6768b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34ecc30cc0697ae888bd339c00c28b1915f6768b/0_0_6248_4884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North view in the 7th floor, IADE building, Santos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"782\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North view in the 7th floor, IADE building, Santos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Eduardo C\u00f4rte-Real/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in the IADE school building, I work in the professors\u2019 room, so busy that sometimes I find myself totally alienated from the delightful urban landscape outside my window.

Back then, only the boldest tourists would risk stepping down from these luxury vessels, imagining they were in Ceuta of the 17th century. Now they roam the city in <em>tuk-tuks</em> like Kafka\u2019s king\u2019s messengers, shaken until lunch blends totally with an afternoon drink, intoxicated by the drivers\u2019 (often wrong) shouted explanations about the history of neighbourhoods and landmark buildings. The contribution of such groups to the city economy is questionable, since the ships pollute like hell and usually the tourists don\u2019t even eat ashore thanks to the ships\u2019 all-inclusive packages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de47006e052c75cf7ce510ceedb1976d592d6126\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de47006e052c75cf7ce510ceedb1976d592d6126/0_0_7520_8781/856.jpg\" alt=\"Lisbon text draft with pictures-co\u0301piaLate afternoon, Jardim das Amoreiras\" width=\"856\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Late afternoon, Jardim das Amoreiras</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Eduardo C\u00f4rte-Real/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the end of the afternoon I\u2019m back in Jardim das Amoreiras.

Admired by Hans Christian Andersen, she was spied on by Ian Fleming, saddened by Amalia and suffocated by Salazar, energised by Eusebio and is today inhabited by Madonna. In her tenacity and reinvention she is like an old vampire woman lingering in her eternity, enjoying this renewed drug of tourism. She will be cruel to unfit people, will sarcastically destroy flipflop users\u2019 feet and bachelorettes\u2019 high heels, resent loud drinkers, and despise those who pretend to own her.

      "bodyText": "Lisbon is irresistible to photograph, film and, of course, draw. For my sketches I normally use a black disposable brush pen and a few grey markers to create a sort of manual aquatint (like a black and white photo). For me, it is a kind of fundamentalism: a drawing should be colourless. But Lisboa has never a city in aquatint. There is something dazzling in her light that requires brighter media. The wide estuary in the south, multiple buildings dressed in azulejos (bright ceramic tiles), and dazzling white stone pavements that mirror an intense extra light, illuminating even the darker shadows. But over the past 10 years, this bright, beautiful city has attracted worldwide interest \u2013 and tourism has increased exponentially. In 2018, 29 million people passed through Lisbon airport alone; Lisboa city has a population of just 500,000. Nowadays, the tourism trend is to pretend to live in a place as locals. Visitors rent apartments neatly furnished, conveniently placed in upper floors showing oblique stunning views of rooftops and a triangle of blue river, close to a small supermarket and a \u201cneighbourhood\u201d restaurant \u2013 everything one needs to feel at home. I welcome these tourists pushing their strollers, spoon stirring their \u20ac0.65 bica (espresso coffee) or supermarket shopping as though they are staying for a month. I wish they would stay: we need inhabitants more than we need transient tenants. Today, despite being surrounded by quite a number of Airbnb apartments, Jardim das Amoreiras is still a quiet, almost unknown Eden on the fringes of the old 19th century town. The tourists who stay here, like the silk, combs, and ceramics once produced in the buildings around the square, descend every morning to the city centre, waiting to be shipped back to their original places. On one of the square\u2019s sides, a giant aqueduct built in the 1740s ends in the first great reservoir of the water distribution system. Ma\u0303e de A\u0301gua (Mother of Water) provided reliable water for all the factories\u2019 needs. Most of the apartment buildings in the area were built in the 1930s as part of the modern urban transformation when the industrial centres had already moved to the eastern part of the city and the south river bank. Twenty years ago it was possible for a middle class family to buy an apartment here. Since then, the prices have more than quadrupled in the area (the most rapid price increase has happened in the past five years). Short term rental companies buy apartments or entice owners to let theirs out. More and more homes are passing out of the normal long term renting market. Early each morning I pass by Ma\u0303e de A\u0301gua. Its purpose was to contain water but, for some glorious reason, they decided to give it architectural significance. From the outside, it looks very plain (itself a miracle during those rococo years) but inside it is breathtaking. I teach at a design school, which since 1996 has been based in a building built on the site of the old Santos dock. So every day, I roll down Sa\u0303o Bento street just like a crate of combs did in 1780. Between Amoreiras and Santos, near Ama\u0301lia Rodrigues Museum, is the 100-year-old swimming club, Clube Nacional de Natac\u0327a\u0303o, where I swim daily. The club used to have an open air swimming pool, which was the only place to swim in the old city centre from 1930s to the 2000s, but it is now covered by padel courts (a strange imprisoned tennis that apparently only Spaniards and Portuguese play). The prime minister\u2019s official residence is nearby, and legend has it that Salazar, Portugal\u2019s dictator between 1936 and 1968, was often annoyed by the joyful screams of children playing in the water. The school where I teach was originally in a palace in Chiado, very close to Largo de Camo\u0303es. The palace has had several tenants, the most famous of whom was General Junot, who conquered Portugal on behalf of Napoleon in the first French invasion. From the main balcony in the palace he could see the Cais do Sodre\u0301 docks, from where the royal family fled to Brazil escorted by British warships. Junot stayed only until August 1808 when his army was defeated. Later, bored in Paris, Madame Junot complained in her writings that she missed Lisbon\u2019s light and delicious fruit. We used to hold life drawing classes in a room called \u201cSala Romana\u201d where the battles between the Romans and the Sabines are frescoed on the walls. The frescoes were finished in 1822, and the artist depicted himself at the age of 25. In 1878 he restored his own paintings and, despite having the option to update his image, chose to keep it as it was 56 years earlier. The school left the building in 2013. These days, the rooms where once Madame Junot rejoiced in the taste of a succulent peach and so many generations of students struggled with art history and human anatomy are a gourmet restaurant. The school\u2019s new building is in the buzzing Santos area \u2013 a former industrial area that until the school moved in was run down and seedy. In 1979, the building where the school now functions was built, designed by a famous preposterous-modernist architect Toma\u0301s Taveira, emulating the steel language of cranes and port facilities. For almost 20 years, it stayed empty and unsellable. When it was acquired in 1996, little by little the surroundings changed, pushed by nearly 1,800 students and 200 faculty staff who come and go daily every academic year. Now it is a trendy area also populated by other art and design schools, the headquarters of a major power company, plus stylish law-firms and tech companies. This is now a place of \u201cfood projects\u201d, regional or political, from France to Mexico to Thailand. One of my favourites is a pizzeria owned by a young Italian couple who, like many, coasted here because of surf and a sort of Californian flair. These restaurants thrive on the hesitations of tourists regarding polvo a\u0300 lagareiro, alheiras, bacalhau a\u0300 gomes de sa\u0301, bitoques and other enigmatic Portuguese menu items, offering the reassurance of universal pizza, French cuisine and burgers. Our life drawing classes also take us out and about in the city. For perspective and landscape, we work in Centro Cultural de Bele\u0301m \u2013 CCB. It is a place with an intense cultural program, auditoriums, several conference rooms, art galleries and lots of fancy commerce. Museum Berardo, also lodged here, holds a remarkable collection of modern art. The building is a compound with streets and squares dominated by a strict modularity and orthogonal organisation making it perfect for understanding perspective. Inside the CCB compound is the appealing Jardim das Oliveiras, a platform garden terrace facing the river. From there we work on capturing landscape, painfully creating a 360-degree panorama composed of eight drawings. Further to the west, close to the final stop of the speedy tram number 15 that swallows and regurgitates crowds of tourists, we find Aqua\u0301rio Vasco da Gama, which has stood there since 1898. It holds the King Carlos I oceanographic collection of specimens, gathered and preserved in pristine flasks, as well as models of bigger marine beasts. On the lower floor we are poltergeisted by several small tanks with remarkable live fish, which the students use for movement studies. The star, however, is a giant squid, resting in a vitrine coffin. Another place we usually visit for drawing sessions is the Museu Geolo\u0301gico in Rua da Academia das Cie\u0302ncias. The museum is housed in the same building that hosts the Academy. This is probably one of the loveliest street in Lisbon. On one side the gardens of almost Edwardian houses jut over garages, and on the other side stands the unassuming Academy fac\u0327ade and restrained working-class houses. The street ends in a narrow passageway to Rua do Se\u0301culo (also a candidate for loveliest street) crowned by a photogenic arch. Back in the IADE school building, I work in the professors\u2019 room, so busy that sometimes I find myself totally alienated from the delightful urban landscape outside my window. Some days I notice the horizontal sunset light bathing the western side of the Bairro Alto hill only while packing my laptop, which I squeeze into the backpack along with my chlorine-smelling swimming gear. From the front side windows we used to see cruise ships docking at a shabby multipurpose terminal. Back then, only the boldest tourists would risk stepping down from these luxury vessels, imagining they were in Ceuta of the 17th century. Now they roam the city in tuk-tuks like Kafka\u2019s king\u2019s messengers, shaken until lunch blends totally with an afternoon drink, intoxicated by the drivers\u2019 (often wrong) shouted explanations about the history of neighbourhoods and landmark buildings. The contribution of such groups to the city economy is questionable, since the ships pollute like hell and usually the tourists don\u2019t even eat ashore thanks to the ships\u2019 all-inclusive packages. By the end of the afternoon I\u2019m back in Jardim das Amoreiras. French soccer moms pack in next to youthful groups and middle age locals around a kiosk that serves drinks and snacks. A playground attracts kindergarten toddlers and their exhausted parents. A television screen sometimes shows a football game. The tourists staying in the surrounding hotels and Airbnb apartments are absent, lingering still near the old centre or in the Bele\u0301m attractions. Ullisabona, Olisipo, Lisboa: mythologically founded by Ulysses, she has seen Vasco da Gama depart and Columbus arrive, astonished Voltaire and seduced Madame Junot. Admired by Hans Christian Andersen, she was spied on by Ian Fleming, saddened by Amalia and suffocated by Salazar, energised by Eusebio and is today inhabited by Madonna. In her tenacity and reinvention she is like an old vampire woman lingering in her eternity, enjoying this renewed drug of tourism. She will be cruel to unfit people, will sarcastically destroy flipflop users\u2019 feet and bachelorettes\u2019 high heels, resent loud drinkers, and despise those who pretend to own her. But those who spend unhurried time carefully observing her light she will seduce utterly.

      "bodyText": "A growing wave of resistance to the expansion of salmon farms along the Chilean coast has led to an important victory in the fight to protect a pristine fjord in southern Patagonia, home to indigenous groups and an array of stunning wildlife. Dolphins, whales and colonies of penguins thrive in the 240km-long Beagle Channel, an area of outstanding natural beauty between Chile and Argentina which attracts tourists from all over the world. Business interests, from both home and abroad, have faced fierce opposition from scientists and campaigners, who claim the introduction of the non-native species will replicate damage caused by the aquaculture industry elsewhere in the region. The local community and campaigners are celebrating an unprecedented triumph after putting a stop to one company\u2019s plans to rear 1.9m fish in 18 cages in what would be the first salmon farms in the Beagle Channel. Earlier this year Greenpeace alleged that the company Nova Austral had illegally installed a number of sea pens on the water near Puerto Williams, the world\u2019s southernmost city. \u201cWe learned the company had a legal restriction [on operating] in that area,\u201d Estefan\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, Greenpeace\u2019s ocean coordinator in Chile, told the Guardian. Three days before the Chilean-owned firm introduced baby salmon to the enclosures it was ordered, on 18 April, to cease operations pending further investigation. This followed an appeal lodged to a court by Greenpeace and the residents of Puerto Williams. Greenpeace claimed satellite photographs taken between January and February this year showed the transfer of materials to establish the cages at sea at a time when such activity would have been prohibited. Nova Austral, which prides itself on rearing salmon without the use of antibiotics, denied any illegal activity and said it did not acquire the fishing concessions from another company until February. The company told the Guardian it would have been \u201cimpossible to initiate operations or constructions prior to that date\u201d as they did not yet own the permits. The Court of Appeal in Punta Arenas ruled 3-0 in the company\u2019s favour. The court case concerned whether the cages were installed legally, but Gonz\u00e1lez explained that separately the fishing authority confirmed that Nova Austral\u2019s permits had already expired. \u201cSo in any case they did not have a valid licence to operate in the Beagle Channel.\u201d In June Nova Austral told the Guardian it intended to defend the validity of the licences but on 11 August a photograph allegedly showing a ship transporting the cages away from the site appeared on social media. One campaigner wrote on Facebook: \u201cFor the first time in Chile\u2019s history, a local community gets justice and forces a multinational salmon farm company to dismantle its illegal and polluting facilities and to leave Beagle Channel waters. Ciao Nova Austral.\u201d The company, which is one of five big seafood producers working in the region, owning 32 out of 130 concessions, confirmed to the Guardian that it had began withdrawing all operations from the Beagle Channel. A company spokesman said: \u201cIn accordance with normal procedures, we are retrieving the pens from the concession area. This will not have an impact on the company\u2019s ability to preserve its legal rights in the zone.\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said the victory highlighted a lack of proper regulation and could lead to a wider shakeup of the industry in Chile, the second biggest producer of farmed salmon worldwide after Norway. \u201cThis is a watershed moment for us because it could open the door to review all the other concessions in Patagonia.\u201d She added: \u201cThe authorities could have checked these licences many years ago. The only reason they are responding now is because of the huge social pressure which has been building in Chile \u2013 in Santiago, in Puerto Arenas, in Puerto Williams.\u201d David Alday Chiguay is a descendant and representative of the Yaghan indigenous community, living in Caleta Mejillones near Puerto Williams. He said the start of the withdrawal of the Nova Austral marine structures marked a historic day for the Yaghan people. The community has lived on the remote southern tip of South America for an estimated 10,000 years, and has strongly opposed the salmon farms. In Villa Ukika, a town created by the Yaghan on the outskirts of Puerto Williams, a festive celebration was held on the day Nova Austral began the removal of its operations. Chiguay said: \u201cIt is a big deal to us to have stopped this because the government is normally on the side of the salmon industry.\u201d Oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Mauricio Ceballos said part of the problem was a system that allowed smaller companies to buy concessions and later sell them to bigger investors with the financial means to implement the farms. He said: \u201cThe Chilean state has made the huge mistake of delivering aquaculture concessions indiscriminately \u2026 without any control and generating huge damage to the environment and local communities.\u201d The withdrawal of operations by Nova Austral in the Beagle Channel is a further blow to the company after it was involved in a data-rigging scandal in June. The company\u2019s CEO, Nicos Nicolaides, was forced to step aside after it was alleged that Nova Austral had misrepresented its fish mortality figures to regulators. The scandal has led to calls for stricter regulation of the industry. The practice of rearing Atlantic salmon has been established in Chile for three decades and more than 1,000 farms currently operate throughout the country, producing 25% of the world\u2019s supply. Salmon farming is the country\u2019s second largest export sector after mining, generating 61,000 jobs. Chile caters for more than 100 international markets with the bulk of exports going to China, Brazil, Russia, Japan and the United States. It is predicted that by 2030, it will have increased its aquaculture fishing exports by 56%. But authorities in some provinces are pushing back on the expansion of the industry due to the pollution it causes. Salmon farmed in Chile are pumped with 500\u2013700 times the amount of antibiotics compared with salmon produced in Norway by the same companies, claims Greenpeace, while huge amounts of waste in the form of faeces and uneaten food pellets end up on the seabed. In addition there are additional pressures on marine life posed by outbreaks of sea lice and farmed fish escaping into the wild. When the king and queen of Norway visited the Chilean town of Punta Arenas during a state visit earlier this year they were met with a series of demonstrations against the expansion of Norwegian-owned salmon farms in the Magallanes region. Leticia Caro is a paramedic and member of the Kaw\u00e9sqar community living in Punta Arenas where the landscape unfolds between fjords and channels that house forests, glaciers, rivers, lagoons and mountain ranges. \u201cIt is special because of its biodiversity, which has hosted the nomadic southern canoeists for thousands of years,\u201d she said. Caro, whose family is dedicated to artisan fishing, said salmon fishing was a destructive industry. \u201cThe expansion of salmon farming in Magallanes will mean the sure death of our seas.\u201d She said that Chile already had the example of Chilo\u00e9, where marine mammals, birds and fish were killed \u201cin apocalyptic quantities\u201d in May 2016 on the coastal edges of the Chilo\u00e9 archipelago. Greenpeace and many locals ascribe the deaths to pollution; the government and local fishing companies dispute this. More than 60 Norwegian companies are already established in Chile, and the royal visit to Magallanes signalled fresh opportunities, with 70 representatives from Norwegian businesses on the state tour. On the other side of the Beagle Channel, in Argentina, residents and environmentalists have been making gains in their own battle to prevent the introduction of the country\u2019s first salmon farms on their side of the fjord. A social movement objecting to salmon farming has been growing since a deal was signed with Norway in 2018 to conduct research into the suitability for salmon farms in the coastal areas of the self-governed province of Tierra del Fuego, including the Beagle Channel. The findings of a year-long fact-find were due to be published earlier this year following an agreement signed between the government of Argentina, along with the local authorities, and the government agency Innovation Norway, but the report is yet to be made public. Scientists and indigenous groups in and around Ushuaia who raised objections were met with a wall of silence until earlier this year when a provincial government spokesperson declared for the first time that salmon farms on the Argentinian coast were \u201cnot on the government\u2019s agenda\u201d. Marine biologist Gustavo Lovrich, who has carried out scientific research in the area since the 1980s, is among those belonging to a civil movement that has been highlighting the negative impact of salmon farming. He said: \u201cSea mammals and sea birds get tangled in the nets, and the employees of these types of farms kill seals that try to get into the cages to eat the fish. \u201cThis is a concern because we have many colonies of fur seals that attract tourists. Introducing salmon farms here would decimate the seal population.\u201d Marcello Lietti, who works for the Chamber of Tourism in Ushuaia, said any activities that negatively affect the region\u2019s rich biodiversity would impact directly on a tourist industry that contributes $74m (\u00a360m) a year to the local economy. \u201cThe Beagle Channel is our second biggest tourist attraction after the Tierra del Fuego national park, and 16,800 Fuegians rely on tourism in the region for their livelihood,\u201d he said. They include Lino Adillon, who has run a seafood restaurant in Ushuaia called Volver since 1988. In the last year the chef decided to suspend the sale of salmon to protect other seafood such as the king crab, a signature dish and local delicacy popular with tourists. \u201cOut of respect for the Beagle Channel and its marine life, upon which my restaurant relies, I took salmon off the menu,\u201d Adillon explained. \u201cIt is unethical to sell this produce, even though it was profitable. I am spreading the word about how bad it is to farm this species, bred in overcrowded cages with huge amounts of antibiotics.\u201d When customers are brought the bill they are also given a flyer explaining the negative impact of salmon farming, said Adillon. \u201cTo obtain a kilo of salmon, five kilos of other fish were sacrificed to feed them in the form of pellets. The planet will eventually run out of those types of fish being caught to feed salmon,\u201d he said. The 1:5 \u201cfish in, fish out\u201d ratio for salmon has been disputed by some in the fishing industry. Lovrich told the Guardian the local community is now pushing for legislation to ban salmon farming in the region. He said while more transparency was needed around the issue, he welcomed a recent political shift that has seen increased support in opposition to salmon farms. The current governor of Tierra del Feugo has not spoken out on the issue but will be stepping down at the end of the year after losing out in elections held in June. Lovrich explained: \u201cWe are hoping for a provincial ban on salmon farming when the new governor takes up their post in December. The new vice governor has previously drafted a bill supporting a ban so we are hopeful this can happen.\u201d Asked about the strong opposition to salmon farming in the Beagle Channel, Innovation Norway said: \u201cIt is up to Argentina to decide whether there will be salmon farming in Patagonia. \u201cThere are negative environmental effects of all food production. Our approach is to contribute to salmon farming being conducted in a sustainable manner. This means it must be research-based, carefully managed and strictly controlled.\u201d Meanwhile a source from Nova Austral said the company would not rule out applying for a permit to farm salmon on the Beagle Channel in the future. For local communities and members of Patagonia\u2019s indigenous groups, the threat from salmon farming is ever-present. \u201cIt is time to unite forces among those who inhabit the territories and strengthen the Argentine-Chilean brotherhood to preserve these pristine waters where life persists,\u201d said Caro. Their voices are supported by a growing body of scientific evidence stacked against the interest of the aquaculture industry. Following the publication of a report by the Forum for the Conservation of the Patagonia Sea last year, its president, Claudio Campagna, gave a stark warning. \u201cBased on the abundant scientific and technical information available, the farming of an introduced species in an ecosystem as rich and fragile as the Patagonian sea would represent a historical error that we will regret forever.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>We live in a world of terrifying flux and instability, where any consideration of what might happen next comes with a side order of blind terror. If you were looking to understand the appeal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lana-del-rey\">Lana Del Rey</a>, eight years and five albums since her commercial breakthrough, you might alight on the fact that she offers a certain respite from uncertainty. You put her albums on and know more or less exactly what will happen next. There will be ballads decorated with cinematic orchestration. Guitars will twang and electronics will waft and surge in a manner that evokes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/24/twin-peaks-soundtrack-david-lynch-angelo-badalamenti\">Angelo Badalementi\u2019s soundtrack</a> to Twin Peaks, and her voice will be swathed in reverb in a manner that evokes Hope Sandoval of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/19/mazzy-star-seasons-of-your-day-interview\">Mazzy Star</a>. The vocals will have a dead-eyed quality at odds with the yearning ache of the lyrics, in which girls will simper after brooding n\u2019er-do-wells they invariably address as \u201cbaby\u201d. A world will be conjured in which every woman is a weak, willing victim and every man an unmitigated tosser and dark intimations of sexual exploitation and violence will co-exist with a kind of 80s Athena poster version of dangerous masculinity: whatever the song, she will invariably sound like she\u2019s singing to a monochrome Matt Dillon lookalike in a white vest, carrying a truck tyre against a desert backdrop, a cigarette dangling from his bruised lips.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ccad39ae7901ab0268173c3d1c3e02c6728bd275\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccad39ae7901ab0268173c3d1c3e02c6728bd275/0_0_499_499/499.jpg\" alt=\"The artwork for Norman Fucking Rockwell!\" width=\"499\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Athena poster version of masculinity \u2026 the artwork for Norman Fucking Rockwell!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Record Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Naysayers quibble that essentially making the same album over and over again represents a failure of imagination: Del Rey wasn\u2019t joking when she admitted she had \u201calready said everything I wanted to say\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/12/lana-del-rey-ultraviolence-album\">after the release of her debut album</a> in 2012. To her fans, however, she is the musical equivalent of a genre fiction novelist or short story writer whose work concentrates in one area. After all, no one ever complained that Raymond Chandler kept wanging on about seedy private eyes and bitchy platinum blondes.</p> <p>Norman Fucking Rockwell! offers evidence for the prosecution and the defence. The formula is intact. Everything proceeds at a glacial pace, strings swell cinematically, guitars twang Twin Peaks-ishly; Del Rey and producer Jack Antonoff put the studio\u2019s reverb unit through its paces, and we once more find ourselves in the presence of ladies saying things like, \u201cI\u2019ll make you real proud of your baby\u201d and \u201cIf you hold me without hurting me you\u2019ll be the first who ever did\u201d to a new selection of unmitigated tossers: callous drug addicts, fly-by-nights, abusers, self-absorbed musicians, etc. \u201cJohn met me by the training yard / Cuts on his face \u2019cause he fought too hard,\u201d she sings on How to Disappear. \u201cI love that man like no other,\u201d she adds. You don\u2019t say.</p> <p>And yet, as on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/21/lana-del-rey-lust-for-life-album-review\">Lust for Life</a> (2017), which stirred a dollop of Trump-era apocalyptic dread into the mix, the formula is subject to subtle alterations. The action has moved to the neighbourhoods of Laurel and Topanga Canyons, and the lyrics are filled with references to music made by their celebrated late-60s denizens, from Mama Cass to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/12/crosby-stills-nash\">Graham Nash</a> to Joni Mitchell. A lot of its tracks open with solo piano before the strings crash in, in the manner of Neil Young\u2019s A Man Needs a Maid. The protagonist of the title track is beset by the suspicion that her Matt Dillon-a-like may be a little too self-absorbed for his own good \u2013 \u201cman-child \u2026 know-it-all\u201d \u2013 which, by the standards of Del Rey\u2019s universe, makes her Andrea Dworkin. She is capable of devising a scenario that sounds convincing rather than caricatured. California offers an impactful female perspective on the kind of crushed masculinity Bruce Springsteen writes about. And there is also the occasional hint that Del Rey may be writing not in deadly earnest but with tongue in cheek. Or at least you hope so: \u201cIf he\u2019s a serial killer, what\u2019s the worst that can happen to a girl that\u2019s already hurt?\u201d she sings on Happiness Is a Butterfly.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrSX_OcpeJg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LrSX_OcpeJg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Lana Del Rey: Fuck It, I Love You / The Greatest \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lyrics aside, the formula doesn\u2019t preclude beautiful songwriting: beguiling, swooning melodies abound on Mariner\u2019s Apartment Complex and Fuck It, I Love You. The disparity between a cover of Sublime\u2019s lumpy Doin\u2019 Time and the quality of the original tunes is unmistakable. Sometimes, the uniformity of mood and pace means that the subtlest production touches leap out: the coda of Cinnamon Girl, with its burst of EDM-ish electronics; the distorted bass that fades in and out of Happiness Is a Butterfly; the breaking glass and sirens buried deep in the mix of Next Best American Record. Elsewhere, the uniformity of tone and pace just sounds uniform, a state of affairs not much helped by the fact that a lot of the tracks feel over-long. The elegiac, end-of-summer mood of Venice Bitch sounds absolutely gorgeous, but it\u2019s allowed to ramble on for 10 minutes, tricked out with guitar solos and extempore vocals.</p> <p>Listening to Norman Fucking Rockwell! is an alternately beguiling and frustrating experience. There are moments when you willingly succumb to its sound and its songwriting, counteracted by moments when you just think: oh God, here we go again. Its author is clearly very talented but it\u2019s hard not to wish that she would broaden her perspective, adopt a different persona, shake things up a little. Eight years and five albums on, that seems unlikely: Del Rey isn\u2019t in the business of springing surprises, which may account for why her business is still flourishing.</p> <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong>Floating Points \u2013 Last Bloom</strong><br>The latest from Sam Shepherd is an intriguing mix of sonic loveliness and unsettling agitation: flecks of beautiful ambient tones undercut by a fidgety, intense rhythm track.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We live in a world of terrifying flux and instability, where any consideration of what might happen next comes with a side order of blind terror. If you were looking to understand the appeal of Lana Del Rey, eight years and five albums since her commercial breakthrough, you might alight on the fact that she offers a certain respite from uncertainty. You put her albums on and know more or less exactly what will happen next. There will be ballads decorated with cinematic orchestration. Guitars will twang and electronics will waft and surge in a manner that evokes Angelo Badalementi\u2019s soundtrack to Twin Peaks, and her voice will be swathed in reverb in a manner that evokes Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star. The vocals will have a dead-eyed quality at odds with the yearning ache of the lyrics, in which girls will simper after brooding n\u2019er-do-wells they invariably address as \u201cbaby\u201d. A world will be conjured in which every woman is a weak, willing victim and every man an unmitigated tosser and dark intimations of sexual exploitation and violence will co-exist with a kind of 80s Athena poster version of dangerous masculinity: whatever the song, she will invariably sound like she\u2019s singing to a monochrome Matt Dillon lookalike in a white vest, carrying a truck tyre against a desert backdrop, a cigarette dangling from his bruised lips. Naysayers quibble that essentially making the same album over and over again represents a failure of imagination: Del Rey wasn\u2019t joking when she admitted she had \u201calready said everything I wanted to say\u201d after the release of her debut album in 2012. To her fans, however, she is the musical equivalent of a genre fiction novelist or short story writer whose work concentrates in one area. After all, no one ever complained that Raymond Chandler kept wanging on about seedy private eyes and bitchy platinum blondes. Norman Fucking Rockwell! offers evidence for the prosecution and the defence. The formula is intact. Everything proceeds at a glacial pace, strings swell cinematically, guitars twang Twin Peaks-ishly; Del Rey and producer Jack Antonoff put the studio\u2019s reverb unit through its paces, and we once more find ourselves in the presence of ladies saying things like, \u201cI\u2019ll make you real proud of your baby\u201d and \u201cIf you hold me without hurting me you\u2019ll be the first who ever did\u201d to a new selection of unmitigated tossers: callous drug addicts, fly-by-nights, abusers, self-absorbed musicians, etc. \u201cJohn met me by the training yard / Cuts on his face \u2019cause he fought too hard,\u201d she sings on How to Disappear. \u201cI love that man like no other,\u201d she adds. You don\u2019t say. And yet, as on Lust for Life (2017), which stirred a dollop of Trump-era apocalyptic dread into the mix, the formula is subject to subtle alterations. The action has moved to the neighbourhoods of Laurel and Topanga Canyons, and the lyrics are filled with references to music made by their celebrated late-60s denizens, from Mama Cass to Graham Nash to Joni Mitchell. A lot of its tracks open with solo piano before the strings crash in, in the manner of Neil Young\u2019s A Man Needs a Maid. The protagonist of the title track is beset by the suspicion that her Matt Dillon-a-like may be a little too self-absorbed for his own good \u2013 \u201cman-child \u2026 know-it-all\u201d \u2013 which, by the standards of Del Rey\u2019s universe, makes her Andrea Dworkin. She is capable of devising a scenario that sounds convincing rather than caricatured. California offers an impactful female perspective on the kind of crushed masculinity Bruce Springsteen writes about. And there is also the occasional hint that Del Rey may be writing not in deadly earnest but with tongue in cheek. Or at least you hope so: \u201cIf he\u2019s a serial killer, what\u2019s the worst that can happen to a girl that\u2019s already hurt?\u201d she sings on Happiness Is a Butterfly. Lyrics aside, the formula doesn\u2019t preclude beautiful songwriting: beguiling, swooning melodies abound on Mariner\u2019s Apartment Complex and Fuck It, I Love You. The disparity between a cover of Sublime\u2019s lumpy Doin\u2019 Time and the quality of the original tunes is unmistakable. Sometimes, the uniformity of mood and pace means that the subtlest production touches leap out: the coda of Cinnamon Girl, with its burst of EDM-ish electronics; the distorted bass that fades in and out of Happiness Is a Butterfly; the breaking glass and sirens buried deep in the mix of Next Best American Record. Elsewhere, the uniformity of tone and pace just sounds uniform, a state of affairs not much helped by the fact that a lot of the tracks feel over-long. The elegiac, end-of-summer mood of Venice Bitch sounds absolutely gorgeous, but it\u2019s allowed to ramble on for 10 minutes, tricked out with guitar solos and extempore vocals. Listening to Norman Fucking Rockwell! is an alternately beguiling and frustrating experience. There are moments when you willingly succumb to its sound and its songwriting, counteracted by moments when you just think: oh God, here we go again. Its author is clearly very talented but it\u2019s hard not to wish that she would broaden her perspective, adopt a different persona, shake things up a little. Eight years and five albums on, that seems unlikely: Del Rey isn\u2019t in the business of springing surprises, which may account for why her business is still flourishing. This week Alexis listened to Floating Points \u2013 Last Bloom The latest from Sam Shepherd is an intriguing mix of sonic loveliness and unsettling agitation: flecks of beautiful ambient tones undercut by a fidgety, intense rhythm track.",

Dr Parveen Parmar, chief of the division of global emergency medicine at the University of Southern California, said in an affidavit that the 33-year-old asylum seeker, Ajay Kumar, is receiving \u201cthe worst medical care I have seen in my 10 years of practice\u201d. Kumar is one of three Indian men on hunger strike in an El Paso immigration detention center who is currently being force-fed \u2013 an act medical bodies and human rights groups have argued represents a form of inhumane and degrading treatment. Three other men were also part of the hunger strike, which began on 8 July, but advocates do not know their current status because two of them were deported and a third was transferred to a detention facility in Florida. A seventh man has ended his strike. The men have been in detention for nearly a year, or longer.

She said he had been hospitalized for three days for a severe throat and nose infection and that Ice began the force-feeding the same day he left the hospital. A fourth hunger striker in El Paso is being represented by another attorney. The force-feeding process in immigration detention is shrouded in secrecy.

He crossed the southern border into the US to seek asylum after fleeing the Indian state of Punjab, where he said he was targeted for political activism. He started the hunger strike after a judge denied his request for bond. On Wednesday, his appeal to have his asylum case reconsidered was denied. Immigration judges have huge discretion in determining who can be released on bond, a legal right Donald Trump\u2019s administration has worked to restrict. Efforts to limit bond, along with the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive immigration clampdown, have seen detention rates skyrocket to an all-time high of more than 54,300 people. In July 2018, a federal judge ordered the government to conduct individual reviews of more than 1,000 asylum seekers\u2019 cases after lawyers sued the government for denying nearly all parole request for asylum seekers in five field offices, including El Paso, since early 2017. Parole is only available to people who seek asylum at legal points of entry, while those who cross outside border checkpoints must apply for bond. Before Trump took office, parole was granted to more than nine out of 10 asylum seekers, according to the suit. \u201cWhen you look at people like my clients, who have constantly been sent to hospital for emergency care and are a huge expense to the government because they are hunger strikers, what is Ice\u2019s prerogative to keep them detained?\u201d Corchado said. \u201cIt\u2019s these desperate acts for release that are deeply troubling to me, but in my eyes it\u2019s a symptom for something much deeper, which is the system we are operating now would rather keep an asylum seeker detained than release them into our country,\u201d Corchado added.",

We live in a second Gilded Age \u2013 an era of extreme economic inequality and monopoly power. Wages for workers have been largely stagnant for a generation, while CEO pay has skyrocketed. A small number of firms now dominate many sectors of the economy. And the consequence for democracy is dire: <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9836.html\">study</a> after <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10831.html\">study</a> in political science shows that government is responsive to the preferences of the wealthy and their interest groups, but not to ordinary people.

The danger of \u201ca permanent inequality of conditions and aristocracy\u201d is upon us.</p> <p>Can democracy survive what capitalism has unleashed? It will depend on what policymakers do and especially what the people \u2013 organized on the streets and at the ballot box \u2013 force them to do.</p> <p>At this critical moment, with the age of neoliberal capitalism coming to an end, I am optimistic we can choose wisely and rescue democracy. I have hope because many of the problems of capitalism are not entirely new and because the playbook for taming industrial capitalism already exists. More than a century ago, when industrial capitalism was on the rise, reformers and intellectuals outlined \u2013 and adopted \u2013 a variety of structures to keep the feral beast within a democratic enclosure.</p> <p>These reformers recognized that concentrated economic power \u2013 in any form \u2013 was a threat to freedom and democracy. Concentrated economic power not only allowed for localized oppression, especially of workers in their daily lives, it also made it more likely that big corporations and wealthy people wouldn\u2019t be subject to the rule of law or democratic controls. Reformers\u2019 answer to the concentration of economic power was threefold: break up economic power, rein it in through regulation, and tax it.</p> <p>It was the reformers of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era who invented America\u2019s antitrust laws \u2013 from the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 to the Clayton Act and Federal Trade Commission Acts of the early 20th century. Whether it was Republican trustbuster Teddy Roosevelt or liberal supreme court justice Louis Brandeis, courageous leaders in this era understood that when companies grow too powerful they threatened not just the economy but democratic government as well. Break-ups were a way to prevent the agglomeration of economic power in the first place, and promote an economic democracy, not just a political democracy.</p> <p>In other sectors, however, monopoly seemed almost necessary. It made more sense to have a single telephone network in America, given the high costs of building the network and the importance of having everyone on it. So here, reformers of the Progressive Era championed public utilities regulation. Democratic control would be preserved through legal restrictions \u2013 regulation of rates, universal service obligations, and non-discrimination rules. Public utilities regulation was a way to ensure that the basic infrastructure of industrial capitalism remained under democratic control, rather than being able to control democracy. This basic infrastructure also ensured that economic democracy could flourish; small businesses and individuals thrive when they have access to the preconditions of modern life at fair terms and for a fair price.</p> <p>Outside of utilities, regulations prohibited unsafe and unhealthy practices \u2013 food and drug laws, child labor laws, workplace safety laws. Reformers pushed for the internal regulation of corporations, calling for the expansion of cooperative ownership and the creation of \u201cindustrial democracy,\u201d and the country ultimately settled on labor union collective bargaining to both empower workers and rein in managers. It was regulation that defanged the most dangerous parts of capitalism.</p> <p>Reformers of this era also understood that individuals and corporations who accumulated enormous amounts of wealth gained political power too, and so could become less accountable in the economy, in the political realm, and in the courts of law. So they passed corporate taxes and income taxes. And when the Supreme Court struck down the federal income tax, Progressive-Era reformers got organized \u2013 and passed a constitutional amendment reversing the Court\u2019s decision.</p> <p>In addition to guarding against the accumulation of economic power, Progressive Era reformers sought to prevent it being converted into political power. To prevent economic power from infecting politics, they passed the first federal campaign finance laws. But they also adopted structural reforms to make the political process itself more democratic. Perhaps the best example is the passage of a constitutional amendment for the direct election of senators. This fundamental change to the constitutional structure ended the era of sometimes corrupt state legislatures sending corporate bosses and their cronies to Washington.</p> <p>Theodore Roosevelt once wrote that \u201cthere can be no real political democracy without something approaching an economic democracy.\u201d The truth is that the two work hand in hand. Political democracy helps foster economic democracy as the people work to make the country more egalitarian. And a more economically equal society feeds into political democracy, as no one accumulates so much power that they can dominate government or their fellow citizens.</p> <p>Antitrust, regulation, tax, democracy reforms \u2013 these were rules that made industrial capitalism work, and kept it from destroying democracy. Even though it\u2019s been gathering dust for decades, this Gilded Age and Progressive Era playbook is the essential starting point for reform today. We must reinvigorate antitrust laws and create a more competitive economy. This means breaking up big tech, big pharma, big banks \u2013 and restructuring and empowering the antitrust agencies so they are empowered to act with courage and vigor.</p> <p>We must revive public utilities regulation and think seriously about the necessary infrastructure of modern society \u2013 from a public option for broadband internet to basic bank accounts for everyone. We need to create a more just and equitable tax system \u2013 including treating all income the same, adopting a wealth tax, and reviving estate and inheritance taxes. This will, as Thomas Jefferson once said of his own economic reforms, lay \u201cthe axe to the root of pseudoaristocracy.\u201d And to accomplish these reforms \u2013 and others \u2013 we will need to start by passing new laws that prevent the corruption of our political process: campaign finance laws, anti-corruption laws, revolving door laws, lobbying laws, and pro-democracy reforms that will empower the people, not just the powerful.</p> <p>None of these reforms will be easy. Some intellectuals and political figures will fight them with claims of efficiency and economic growth. Many others who personally benefit from the status quo will fight to halt, slow, or water down reforms. As Frederick Douglass once observed: \u201cPower concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\u201d</p> <p>But even with a revival of these strategies, even with the political movement to back it up, even with courageous leaders at the helm to implement these policies, the roadmap for reforming industrial capitalism will still be insufficient to rescue democracy today. New approaches will also be needed.</p> <p>A central lesson of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era reformers is not what they did to reform the system. It is that they had the courage and creativity to think for themselves and pursue bold reforms, persistently, over decades.</p> <p>A new generation will have to adapt the old playbook to new challenges. Industrial capitalism\u2019s basic structure is changing. As Shoshona Zuboff has argued in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the rise of surveillance technology and behavioral targeting risks an economic revolution that turns consumers into commodities and a political revolution that could morph democracy into digital authoritarianism. To paraphrase Tocqueville, if a permanent inequality of conditions or a nationalist oligarchy come to define the next generation, they could very well enter through these doors.</p>",

Jos\u00e9 ate them for breakfast. A lot of them.</p> <p>The Guardian visited Jos\u00e9, Marta and the rest of the family in a Virginia suburb on the day of his return. Jos\u00e9\u2019s sisters couldn\u2019t stop hugging him. Marta was still in tears of relief. She moved to the US before Jos\u00e9, and provided for him by sending money to El Salvador. His siblings had followed but, concerned about Jos\u00e9\u2019s condition, Marta made the difficult decision to leave him at home, where he was cared for by his grandmother, then his cousin.</p> <p>After Jos\u00e9 arrived in El Paso and was sent back to Mexico, he lost touch with his family.

This one, like the one from his doctor in El Salvador, found he had the intellectual capacity of a four-year-old, and was also suffering from anxiety and depression.</p> <p>Government lawyers still argued against Jos\u00e9 being allowed to enter the US, and he was detained in Ice custody for weeks while Tapia and Jos\u00e9\u2019s lawyer, Marysol Bretado, battled on \u2019s his behalf, fighting against the monolithic and labyrinthine asylum regulations.</p> <p>On Monday, Jos\u00e9, his family, and his supporters finally got their wish.

      "bodyText": "In the early hours of Wednesday morning, at an airport in northern Virginia, Jos\u00e9 was finally reunited with his family. They had been waiting five months for this moment. When Jos\u00e9 emerged, his mother, Marta, grabbed her son tight and wouldn\u2019t let go. She could not stop crying. Jos\u00e9, who is 28 but has the mental capacity of a four-year-old, had made it to Virginia after a torrid, at times terrifying, five months at the hands of Donald Trump\u2019s brutal immigration policy. He and his cousin had arrived in El Paso, in south-west Texas, in March, seeking asylum. Jos\u00e9 was carrying a note from his doctor, spelling out his cognitive disability. Despite that, Jos\u00e9 was separated from his cousin, who had been his carer in their home country of El Salvador, and sent back to Mexico alone. The Guardian is using first names only for Jos\u00e9 and his family for their security. Jos\u00e9 was another victim of Trump\u2019s Remain in Mexico program, which has turned back tens of thousands of asylum seekers at the border since it was introduced in March. Forced to return to already crowded cities, many have fallen victim to organized crime. People have been raped and killed. Jos\u00e9 himself was kidnapped and extorted. It made the reunion at Dulles airport, 30 miles west of Washington DC, particularly emotional. \u201cI was very, very happy. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was shaking. I felt my stomach jumping from nerves,\u201d Marta said. She was at the airport with one of Jos\u00e9\u2019s sisters and one of his brothers \u2013 all four of his siblings are already in the US, having fled gang violence back home. They brought balloons, two of them yellow with smiley faces. Jos\u00e9\u2019s flight was delayed, and they waited there patiently for two hours. \u201cThere were many, many tears,\u201d Marta said of her son\u2019s arrival. \u201cWe both got chills when we hugged.\u201d When they got back to Marta\u2019s apartment Jos\u00e9 was feeling sick. Marta made him tea, rubbed his chest and eased him to sleep. The next morning he had perked up. He was ready for his favorite meal: pupusas, a Salvadoran flatbread, cooked by Marta. Jos\u00e9 ate them for breakfast. A lot of them. The Guardian visited Jos\u00e9, Marta and the rest of the family in a Virginia suburb on the day of his return. Jos\u00e9\u2019s sisters couldn\u2019t stop hugging him. Marta was still in tears of relief. She moved to the US before Jos\u00e9, and provided for him by sending money to El Salvador. His siblings had followed but, concerned about Jos\u00e9\u2019s condition, Marta made the difficult decision to leave him at home, where he was cared for by his grandmother, then his cousin. After Jos\u00e9 arrived in El Paso and was sent back to Mexico, he lost touch with his family. He had no money, no phone and no real understanding of where he was, and was eventually taken in by the Buen Pastor shelter, in a rundown area of Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. Jos\u00e9 had been living at the shelter for weeks before he came to the attention of immigration advocates working at the border. The Guardian first met Jos\u00e9 at Buen Pastor in July, when his lawyers were in the process of arguing he should not be forced to stay in Mexico alone. Department of Homeland Security regulations, Jos\u00e9\u2019s lawyers argue, say people with mental disabilities, and people from populations deemed at risk, such as LGBTQ people or people with physical disabilities, should not be subject to the Remain in Mexico program. But Jos\u00e9, like dozens of others in Ju\u00e1rez alone, had fallen through the cracks. \u201cThe so-called Migrant Protection Protocols offer no protection, and only ad hoc protocol as to how to handle migrants forced to remain in Mexico,\u201d said Edith Tapia, an immigration advocate at the social justice not-for-profit Hope Border Institute, who accompanied Jos\u00e9 to Virginia. \u201cJos\u00e9\u2019s case is emblematic of how the Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly and explicitly broken their own rules of exemptions and returned the most vulnerable populations to the delicate ecosystem of Ju\u00e1rez,\u201d she added. Jos\u00e9 had appeared in El Paso immigration court in July, fresh with the results of a new psychiatric exam. This one, like the one from his doctor in El Salvador, found he had the intellectual capacity of a four-year-old, and was also suffering from anxiety and depression. Government lawyers still argued against Jos\u00e9 being allowed to enter the US, and he was detained in Ice custody for weeks while Tapia and Jos\u00e9\u2019s lawyer, Marysol Bretado, battled on \u2019s his behalf, fighting against the monolithic and labyrinthine asylum regulations. On Monday, Jos\u00e9, his family, and his supporters finally got their wish. He was abruptly released on humanitarian parole. He could finally join his family. The next day, aided by the charity Miles4Migrants, he flew to Virginia with Tapia. At Marta\u2019s small apartment, where a bedroom had been waiting for Jos\u00e9 for months, he was tucking into more pupusas by Wednesday afternoon. They were as good as he remembered, he said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to have him here,\u201d Marta said. She had been unable to sleep for months over concern for her son, but on Wednesday morning, Marta was sleeping so soundly she slept through her alarm. \u201cThis was the first night I didn\u2019t have to worry about him,\u201d she said. Jos\u00e9\u2019s parole lasts until February 2020, by which point it will be 11 months since he first arrived in the US. He has to check in with US Citizenship and Immigration Services officials over the next few months, while his attorney in El Paso appeals to have his asylum case switched to the Virginia court system. But the long-term future for Jos\u00e9 remains uncertain. His family hope he is granted asylum, but it is a difficult, exhausting process. Jos\u00e9 himself would like to work, and says he wants to look after his mother. On Tuesday, a day after being released from custody, and hours before his flight to Dulles, he earned $20 cleaning a yard in El Paso. He gave the money to Marta at the airport. For now, the family is just pleased to have Jos\u00e9 back. He turned 28 on Friday, and they are planning to celebrate both his birthday and his arrival. There will be a pi\u00f1ata, balloons, cakes and lots of pupusas. \u201cWe\u2019re going to party like never before,\u201d Marta said. \u201cOur family is complete now.\u201d",

If you look at how its spread out over five years, it doesn\u2019t take into account typical seniority increases and additional healthcare costs,\u201d added Cantor. \u201cEven though district healthcare costs have gone down, they want to charge us more.\u201d</p> <p>The Chicago Public Schools district said in a <a href=\"https://blog.cps.edu/2019/08/26/cps-accepts-teachers-contract-terms-proposed-by-independent-fact-finder/\">statement</a>, \u201cCPS is fully committed to reaching a fair contract as soon as possible.

Teachers in Clark county, Nevada, the fifth-largest school district in the US with about 18,800 educators, have set a strike date for 10 September \u2013 despite the fact that the strike would be illegal under state law \u2013 if an agreement on a new contract with the district can\u2019t be reached by then. \u201cWe have the largest class sizes in the nation. Class sizes are out of control,\u201d said Kristin Nigro, a kindergarten teacher at Schorr Elementary school in Las Vegas. Nigro claimed Clark county school district has repeatedly reneged on contracts, and failed to pay promised raises to teachers over the past few years. \u201cWe are doing this because we\u2019ve been pushed to the brink,\u201d said Nigro. \u201cWe\u2019re the fifth largest school district in the nation and we don\u2019t even have a set curriculum in place to vertically align our standards so these kids are successful.\u201d Teachers in the district who have invested significant time and money into obtaining extra training and education have been denied pay raises promised by the school district\u2019s salary schedule. \u201cI paid $50,000 out of my own pocket to advance my career and make myself a better teacher, I\u2019m just asking for the raise I was promised,\u201d said Matthew Kranz, a high school math teacher who works a second job to make ends meet. \u201cThree years later and two masters degrees, I haven\u2019t even gotten a penny out of it. I\u2019m actually making the same as someone fresh out of college.\u201d Clark county school district did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The district has filed a request for an injunction to prevent the strike. In Chicago the teachers union in the second largest school district in the US has threatened a possible strike for months as new contract negotiations with recently elected Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration have stalled. A fact-finder report on the new contract negotiations was released on 26 August and the union has 30 days until it can legally go on strike as contract negotiations continue. \u201cThe fact-finder [report] did not make a useful contribution in terms of our ability to settle a contract,\u201d said Jesse Sharkey, president of the Chicago Teachers Union. He cited wage recommendations that he said were too low and said other areas of concern were ignored in the report. He said the negotiations were \u201cthe best opportunity we\u2019ve had in decades to address an accumulated series of systematic shortfalls, austerity, cuts, and insults that the people in these schools have been forced to live under\u201d. \u201cWe are a school system that deals with large concentrations of poverty, many of our neighborhoods have record-setting levels of violence and other kinds of trauma and we really need to see resources in our classrooms in order to deliver a high quality education to everyone in Chicago,\u201d he said. Philip Cantor, a science teacher at North-Grand high school in Chicago, said resources were inequitably distributed throughout the district, with many schools without librarians, full-time school nurses, and understaffed substitute teachers. \u201cIf the school can\u2019t find a sub, teachers wind up having to sub for other teachers and they lose their preparation time,\u201d Cantor said. He added the district is also pushing to reduce preparation periods for elementary school teachers, and the district is mischaracterizing the wage increases while proposing to charge teachers more for healthcare. \u201cThe district is saying there is this huge increase in pay, when actually it\u2019s not. If you look at how its spread out over five years, it doesn\u2019t take into account typical seniority increases and additional healthcare costs,\u201d added Cantor. \u201cEven though district healthcare costs have gone down, they want to charge us more.\u201d The Chicago Public Schools district said in a statement, \u201cCPS is fully committed to reaching a fair contract as soon as possible. We believe the fact-finder report provides a strong framework for a fair deal, and we will do everything in our power to reach a fair deal and avoid any disruption to the school year.\u201d Last year, the largest teacher strikes in the United States occurred in West Virginia (35,000 workers), Kentucky (26,000 workers), and Oklahoma (45,000 workers). Though teachers in these states won significant victories from those work stoppages, many are still struggling and are weighing further action. Teachers in West Virginia are currently drafting a lawsuit to oppose efforts by Republican state legislators to launch new charter schools in the state. \u201cWe contend the charter schools go against the West Virginia constitution. It states clearly in our constitution that before you can have any new educational system it has to be voted on by the voters and we contend even though these charters are labeled public charter schools, in essence it creates a new school system,\u201d said West Virginia Educators Association president Dale Lee. He noted teachers are also bracing for legislation in the upcoming state session that would punish teachers for any future work stoppages and health insurance for teachers still requires proper funding past 2021. In Kentucky, teachers are focused on trying to oust current Republican governor Matt Bevin in response to his opposition to teachers demands. The group is backing current Kentucky attorney general Andy Bashear for governor over Bevin, and teacher Jacqueline Coleman for lieutenant governor in the November 2019 election. Earlier this year, teachers in the state conducted a sick-out to protest proposed teacher pension cuts. Bevin claimed in a recent interview the sick-out was an excuse for teachers to take paid time off work and his labor cabinet issued a statement on 16 August threatening civil recourse for any future work stoppages. \u201cOur governor constantly insults us, calls us names, says we\u2019re selfish and short-sighted, ignorant, compared us to drowning victims who need to be knocked out to be saved, says we\u2019re responsible for children being molested and using drugs and says he regrets none of what he has said about teachers. He\u2019s a real gem,\u201d said Jeni Bolander, a teacher in Fayette county, Kentucky and a member of the grassroots educator group Kentucky 120 United.",

Based on the YA novel by Jay Asher, the show\u2019s first season probed the lives of many students at Liberty High, each of whom was impacted by the death of one of their classmates, Hannah Baker. Told in voiceover from Hannah\u2019s perspective, 13 Reasons Why was celebrated for daring to look at teenage mental health yet sharply criticized for how it handled teen suicide. Many psychologists raised concerns that one specific scene depicting how Hannah did it (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/16/netflix-cuts-controversial-suicide-scene-from-13-reasons-why\">which was removed several years later</a>) could spark a contagion effect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/03/from-skins-to-the-joys-of-teen-sex-the-most-extreme-teenage-series-ever\">From Skins to The Joys of Teen Sex: the most extreme teenage series ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response, the series has now spent two seasons trying to have its cake and eat it, doubling down on its insistence that it\u2019s an essential show that takes teenage pain seriously, while also turning those same issues into a melodramatic soap opera. While it was always overwrought, the first season of 13 Reasons Why was punctuated with moments of sincerity that rang true, especially in scenes that illustrated the friendship and connection between Hannah and her exceptionally earnest friend Clay. In contrast, the subsequent two seasons have routinely missed the mark, depicting adolescence as a time of cloying sweetness and unbearable cruelty. In the recently released third season, it continues to traffic in cliche, presenting a teen drama that is one-part soap opera and one part after-school special.</p> <p>The result is a show that comes across as slapdash and careless about the very problems it proclaims to take seriously. At least the second season, which was often frustrating and included a scene of sexual violence that came across as lurid and exploitative, remained invested in looking more deeply at Hannah\u2019s character and how her suicide affected those closest to her. In contrast, the third season just isn\u2019t sure what to do with itself and its characters. The series reboots itself as a supposedly less inflammatory teen murder-mystery that manages somehow to be boring, manipulative and toxic all at once. The season is barely held together by the narration of a completely new narrator, Ani, an annoyingly self-absorbed and self-aggrandizing recent transfer to Liberty High, who waxes on philosophically about truth and secrets as fellow students are placed through a laundry list of \u201cteen issues\u201d such as bullying, teen pregnancy, drug use, assault and sexual violence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pws-LN_-riM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pws-LN_-riM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In moving away from Hannah\u2019s story, it\u2019s clear that 13 Reasons Why hoped to put to bed many of the complaints about the ways that the series could affect vulnerable teens.

Certainly, there are other ensemble dramas that struggle with too many storylines, but 13 Reasons Why is so obsessed with showcasing teen trauma that the series doesn\u2019t even seem invested in specific character development, which is why tacking on Ani as a strange new narrator who has no connection at all to Liberty High struck even diehard fans as strange and off-putting.</p> <p>Worse still, the most recent season is also shockingly lacking in nuance, especially as it aims to humanize Bryce, a serial rapist and bully, who has been terrorizing Liberty High since the first episode. His character is given center stage throughout the season, with the show\u2019s aim clearly being to demonstrate how a kinder, gentler Bryce is capable of being more than vicious. Certainly, there are any number of sophisticated dramas that force viewers to contend with fascinatingly complex villains, but Bryce\u2019s shift from sadistic rapist to troubled teen is so underwritten it could barely be described as character development at all.

Andy Chan, head of a now banned pro-independence party, was also arrested. An appeals panel has denied permission to hold a major rally that had been planned for Saturday in a continuation of the mass protests that have now lasted almost three months.</p> <p>Both Wong and Chow were taken to police headquarters in Wan Chai where authorities said they were charged over a demonstration that surrounded police headquarters on 21 June. The pair are former student leaders of the \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d pro-democracy protests in 2014. Chan was arrested at Hong Kong international airport while on his way to Japan, reports said. Police confirmed a 29-year-old man had been detained on suspicion of \u201cparticipating in riots\u201d and \u201cattacking police\u201d. Chan\u2019s Hong Kong National party was proscribed last year on grounds of national security \u2013 the first political group to be outlawed in decades.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Step up the tempo\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Brexit negotiators for Britain and the EU will meet twice a week after Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/time-to-step-up-tempo-of-brexit-talks-says-bullish-boris-johnson\">told officials to \u201cstep up the tempo\u201d</a> in trying to get a deal without the Irish backstop.

Our political team write that ministers privately admit they face a battle to stop anti-no-deal legislation in the Commons and will try to frustrate rebels\u2019 efforts in the House of Lords, where the legislation will need to be passed before parliament is suspended. Jeremy Corbyn said parliament must \u201clegislate rapidly\u201d on Tuesday next week to try to stop a no-deal Brexit. The Labour leader pledged to launch an attempt to stop prorogation \u2013 meanwhile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/proroguing-parliament-is-unlawful-abuse-of-power-court-told\">court challenges are under way</a> with a judge due to announce a decision in Edinburgh this morning and legal action also being taken in Belfast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/29/proroguing-parliament-precedent-boris-johnson-high-court\">and London</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>HRT cancer risk \u2013 </strong>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/29/breast-cancer-risk-from-using-hrt-is-twice-what-was-thought\">direct cause of breast cancer and carries twice the risk previously thought</a>, according to research. A million women in the UK and millions more around the world use HRT. The study published in the Lancet says one in 50 women of average weight taking the most common form \u2013 combined daily oestrogen and progestogen \u2013 for five years will get breast cancer as a result. The UK\u2019s drug licensing body suggested women who are using or have used HRT should be vigilant for signs of breast cancer. Prof Janice Rymer from the Royal College of GPs said: \u201cWomen must be informed of the small increase in risk of breast cancer so they can weigh this up against the benefits that they may have from taking HRT.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>No single \u2018gay gene\u2019 \u2013 </strong>A study has quashed the idea that a single \u201cgay gene\u201d exists. Using genetic databases, researchers found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/29/scientists-quash-idea-of-single-gay-gene\">five tiny differences in DNA that showed a clear link to same-sex sexual behaviour</a>: two in both men and women, two found only in men and one found only in women. But even taken together, these five explained less than 1% of the variation in same-sex behaviour among participants \u2013 suggesting many other variants are involved in subtle ways. Overall, the researchers say, about a third of the variation in same-sex behaviour is probably explained by genetics, but it is not possible to use DNA to predict whether an individual will have same-sex partners. The authors say their findings provide \u201cfurther evidence that diverse sexual behaviour is a natural part of overall human variation\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Comey criticised over leaks \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump has seized on justice department findings that James Comey, whom he fired as FBI director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/29/james-comey-justice-department-watchdog-fbi-violations\">broke department rules</a> when he shared details from memos of his interactions with the president. The inspector-general\u2019s office said it decided not to prosecute after finding \u201cno evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Andy Chan arrested Hello, Warren Murray with you at the end of a busy working week in the news. The prominent pro-democracy figures Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow have been arrested in Hong Kong, with Wong said to have been snatched off the street and bundled into a van. Andy Chan, head of a now banned pro-independence party, was also arrested. An appeals panel has denied permission to hold a major rally that had been planned for Saturday in a continuation of the mass protests that have now lasted almost three months. Both Wong and Chow were taken to police headquarters in Wan Chai where authorities said they were charged over a demonstration that surrounded police headquarters on 21 June. The pair are former student leaders of the \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d pro-democracy protests in 2014. Chan was arrested at Hong Kong international airport while on his way to Japan, reports said. Police confirmed a 29-year-old man had been detained on suspicion of \u201cparticipating in riots\u201d and \u201cattacking police\u201d. Chan\u2019s Hong Kong National party was proscribed last year on grounds of national security \u2013 the first political group to be outlawed in decades. * * * \u2018Step up the tempo\u2019 \u2013 Brexit negotiators for Britain and the EU will meet twice a week after Boris Johnson told officials to \u201cstep up the tempo\u201d in trying to get a deal without the Irish backstop. A growing number of senior Tory rebels have signalled they are prepared to back urgent legislation to thwart a no-deal Brexit after Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. Our political team write that ministers privately admit they face a battle to stop anti-no-deal legislation in the Commons and will try to frustrate rebels\u2019 efforts in the House of Lords, where the legislation will need to be passed before parliament is suspended. Jeremy Corbyn said parliament must \u201clegislate rapidly\u201d on Tuesday next week to try to stop a no-deal Brexit. The Labour leader pledged to launch an attempt to stop prorogation \u2013 meanwhile court challenges are under way with a judge due to announce a decision in Edinburgh this morning and legal action also being taken in Belfast and London. * * * HRT cancer risk \u2013 Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a direct cause of breast cancer and carries twice the risk previously thought, according to research. A million women in the UK and millions more around the world use HRT. The study published in the Lancet says one in 50 women of average weight taking the most common form \u2013 combined daily oestrogen and progestogen \u2013 for five years will get breast cancer as a result. The UK\u2019s drug licensing body suggested women who are using or have used HRT should be vigilant for signs of breast cancer. Prof Janice Rymer from the Royal College of GPs said: \u201cWomen must be informed of the small increase in risk of breast cancer so they can weigh this up against the benefits that they may have from taking HRT.\u201d * * * No single \u2018gay gene\u2019 \u2013 A study has quashed the idea that a single \u201cgay gene\u201d exists. Using genetic databases, researchers found five tiny differences in DNA that showed a clear link to same-sex sexual behaviour: two in both men and women, two found only in men and one found only in women. But even taken together, these five explained less than 1% of the variation in same-sex behaviour among participants \u2013 suggesting many other variants are involved in subtle ways. Overall, the researchers say, about a third of the variation in same-sex behaviour is probably explained by genetics, but it is not possible to use DNA to predict whether an individual will have same-sex partners. The authors say their findings provide \u201cfurther evidence that diverse sexual behaviour is a natural part of overall human variation\u201d. * * * Comey criticised over leaks \u2013 Donald Trump has seized on justice department findings that James Comey, whom he fired as FBI director, broke department rules when he shared details from memos of his interactions with the president. The inspector-general\u2019s office said it decided not to prosecute after finding \u201cno evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media\u201d. Comey\u2019s disclosures helped fuel the two-year Trump-Russia investigation in which Robert Mueller declined to exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. * * * Free at last \u2013 A man from Alabama who at 22 was jailed for life without parole for stealing $50.75 from a bakery is to be released after more than three decades. Alvin Kennard was first imprisoned in 1983 under Alabama\u2019s old Habitual Felony Offender Act, also known as the \u201cthree strikes law\u201d. On Wednesday a circuit judge cut the sentence to time already served. Kennard reportedly told the judge he wants to work as a carpenter. His lawyer said \u201chundreds\u201d of people are still similarly imprisoned for nonviolent crimes because they don\u2019t have attorneys. * * * Not quite Space Force \u2013 Donald Trump has launched Space Command or SpaceCom, reviving a military division that was shut down in 2002 as part of a government restructuring. Its operations are expected to include enabling satellite-based navigation and communications for troops in the field, providing warning of missile launches abroad, and defending against disruption by Chinese and Russian anti-satellite weapons. The president\u2019s much-vaunted Space Force \u2013 which would join the army, navy, air force, marine corps and coast guard as a distinct service \u2013 is yet to clear Congress.

      "body": "<p>Watching my two children struggle along the platform like geriatric tortoises under their new backpacks, I had a moment of doubt. It was 5am on a dull, Monday in London and we were about to embark on a journey that would take us, by train, all the way to Stockholm.</p> <p>With the help of <a href=\"https://www.seat61.com/\" title=\"\">the Man in Seat 61 website</a>, I worked out that a <a href=\"https://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes/global-pass\" title=\"\">Global Interrail pass</a> was the best way for our crew (my husband, me and our 11- and nine-year-old daughters) to get there. The pass covers most continental trains, is extremely flexible and \u2013 best of all \u2013 free for children under 12 accompanied by an adult. I also booked our hotels and a cabin on the Stockholm archipelago.</p> <p>We arrived in Brussels on the Eurostar in time for breakfast and, after dropping our luggage at the <a href=\"http://www.bxlroom.com/\" title=\"\">BXLroom Guesthouse</a> (a converted factory in the Stalingrad area; studio \u20ac150 a night), it was time for waffles from one of the many nearby street stalls \u2013 where a simple sugar waffle costs \u20ac1.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c12747f01da13fd7b190a853f98f6c545d893d6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c12747f01da13fd7b190a853f98f6c545d893d6e/0_172_5950_3571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brussels\u2019 Royal Arcade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brussels\u2019 Royal Arcade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We took in the Royal Arcade, lined with chocolate shops, the Grand Place, the Manneken Pis \u2026 and then moved swiftly on to the wonderful <a href=\"https://choco-story-brussels.be/\" title=\"\">Choco-Story</a>, the city\u2019s chocolate museum (adult \u20ac9.50, 6-11 \u20ac6.50, under 6 free). The next morning we returned to Brussels Midi station to catch the train to Hamburg via Cologne. Two hours later, having had a br\u00e4twurst lunch at Cologne\u2019s central station, we took the ICE train to Hamburg.</p> <p>The pink-chandeliered lobby of the <a href=\"https://curiocollection3.hilton.com/en/hotels/hamburg/reichshof-hamburg-curio-collection-by-hilton-HAMRHQQ/index.html\" title=\"\">Reichshof Hamburg hotel</a> (junior suite \u20ac155) welcomed us like a vision from The Grand Budapest Hotel, with the bonus of a gin cafe over the road.

This time the 9.30am to Copenhagen, via Puttgarden \u2013 where the train was loaded on to a hybrid ferry for a 50-minute trip across a narrow sound to Denmark. Once in Copenhagen, our gang boarded the high-speed X2000, crossed the \u00d8resund bridge (made famous by TV series The Bridge) and, five hours later, we were at Stockholm\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.scandichotels.com/hotels/sweden/stockholm/scandic-no-53\" title=\"\">Scandic 53</a> (superior room \u00a3160) \u2013 and ready for a good night\u2019s sleep.</p> <p>As much as I wanted to linger over Stockholm\u2019s scandi-design, we needed to get to <a href=\"https://www.visitstockholm.com/see--do/attractions/stromkajen/\" title=\"\">Str\u00f6mkajen</a>, one of the city\u2019s two ferry ports, where a boat would take us to H\u00e4stholmen, our island home for eight days.</p> <p>As Stockholm fell away, the scenery became one of rocky islands covered with pine forests. Sweden had long been a fairytale destination for me and now, sitting out on the sunny deck, gazing at red, Pippi Longstocking-esque houses that peeped out over wooden jetties, I had the sense of a dream coming true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4e7f530b919d0f226cdf2cff9b9cd299c5df148\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4e7f530b919d0f226cdf2cff9b9cd299c5df148/39_0_4129_2477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boat en route to Vaxholm, Stockholm archipelago, Sweden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boat en route to Vaxholm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After an hour the boat docked at Vaxholm, the capital of the archipelago.

Then the ferry was off again; the remaining passengers loaded with food and crates of beer and wine.</p> <p>There are around <a href=\"https://visitsweden.com/stockholm-archipelago/\" title=\"\">30,000 islands, in the Stockholm archipelago</a>: some just rocky outcrops nested by sea birds, others, such as Vaxholm and M\u00f6ja, are thriving communities.

      "bodyText": "Watching my two children struggle along the platform like geriatric tortoises under their new backpacks, I had a moment of doubt. It was 5am on a dull, Monday in London and we were about to embark on a journey that would take us, by train, all the way to Stockholm. With the help of the Man in Seat 61 website, I worked out that a Global Interrail pass was the best way for our crew (my husband, me and our 11- and nine-year-old daughters) to get there. The pass covers most continental trains, is extremely flexible and \u2013 best of all \u2013 free for children under 12 accompanied by an adult. I also booked our hotels and a cabin on the Stockholm archipelago. We arrived in Brussels on the Eurostar in time for breakfast and, after dropping our luggage at the BXLroom Guesthouse (a converted factory in the Stalingrad area; studio \u20ac150 a night), it was time for waffles from one of the many nearby street stalls \u2013 where a simple sugar waffle costs \u20ac1. We took in the Royal Arcade, lined with chocolate shops, the Grand Place, the Manneken Pis \u2026 and then moved swiftly on to the wonderful Choco-Story, the city\u2019s chocolate museum (adult \u20ac9.50, 6-11 \u20ac6.50, under 6 free). The next morning we returned to Brussels Midi station to catch the train to Hamburg via Cologne. Two hours later, having had a br\u00e4twurst lunch at Cologne\u2019s central station, we took the ICE train to Hamburg. The pink-chandeliered lobby of the Reichshof Hamburg hotel (junior suite \u20ac155) welcomed us like a vision from The Grand Budapest Hotel, with the bonus of a gin cafe over the road. We walked around Alster Lake, one of the city\u2019s two manmade lakes, which was busy on a summer\u2019s evening with dinghies and rowing crews. The children had hamburgers in Hamburg on their minds, though, so we headed to Otto\u2019s. A long day of travel meant another morning railway station departure. This time the 9.30am to Copenhagen, via Puttgarden \u2013 where the train was loaded on to a hybrid ferry for a 50-minute trip across a narrow sound to Denmark. Once in Copenhagen, our gang boarded the high-speed X2000, crossed the \u00d8resund bridge (made famous by TV series The Bridge) and, five hours later, we were at Stockholm\u2019s Scandic 53 (superior room \u00a3160) \u2013 and ready for a good night\u2019s sleep. As much as I wanted to linger over Stockholm\u2019s scandi-design, we needed to get to Str\u00f6mkajen, one of the city\u2019s two ferry ports, where a boat would take us to H\u00e4stholmen, our island home for eight days. As Stockholm fell away, the scenery became one of rocky islands covered with pine forests. Sweden had long been a fairytale destination for me and now, sitting out on the sunny deck, gazing at red, Pippi Longstocking-esque houses that peeped out over wooden jetties, I had the sense of a dream coming true. After an hour the boat docked at Vaxholm, the capital of the archipelago. Most passengers disembarked here, to lunch at the famous Waxholms Hotell or visit the Vaxholm fortress, a granite mass of battlements. Then the ferry was off again; the remaining passengers loaded with food and crates of beer and wine. There are around 30,000 islands, in the Stockholm archipelago: some just rocky outcrops nested by sea birds, others, such as Vaxholm and M\u00f6ja, are thriving communities. The majority, though, provide weekend and summer homes \u2013 buzzing with motor boats and hot tubs until mid-October when, it goes quiet and dark. Finding a rental house on the archipelago from the UK wasn\u2019t easy: there are so many islands and, to me, online information felt limited. We used Airbnb, where the houses ranged from summer palaces with their own jetties, saunas, boats and beaches, to rustic shacks that looked charming but offered little more than four wooden walls, a bed and an outdoor, composting toilet. There was, it seemed, something for everyone. The islands are divided into the inner, middle and outer archipelago. The inner ones are clustered around Vaxholm, where we were, and are essentially Stockholm\u2019s version of England\u2019s home counties; while the middle is akin to the Lake District; and the outer, more like the Scottish Highlands.

Goldie is lightly disguised as a character called Rage. Like Goldie, he has survived an appalling childhood of abandonment, neglect and abuse to become the biggest star in Britain\u2019s burgeoning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/drum-n-bass\" title=\"\">drum\u2019n\u2019bass scene</a>. Like Goldie, he has a penchant for gold jewellery and grills and, like Goldie, there is a great weight of music-industry expectation around his forthcoming album: expectation that goes up in smoke the minute he presses play.</p> <p>\u201cPeople cross and recross their legs, sip their wine and pray for it to end,\u201d offers the novel\u2019s horrendous narrator, Steve Stelfox. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t. As the track approaches the one-hour mark and nothing has emerged that vaguely resembles a hook, or a chorus, or a recognisable melody, it collectively dawns on us that we\u2019re listening to the sonic representation of someone\u2019s mind coming apart. On a positive note, I\u2019m thinking that I must get the number of Rage\u2019s dealer, because the chang he\u2019s on is clearly fucking phenomenal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRather a good book,\u201d smiles Goldie, when the subject of Niven\u2019s novel and its depiction of Mother\u2019s premiere comes up. Back in the UK from his home in Thailand and seated in a bar in King\u2019s Cross, central London, he is talking, as is his wont, in lengthy, breathless bursts of puns, anecdotes and malapropisms. His answers zig-zag unpredictably between topics, occasionally contradicting something he said earlier, frequently ending up somewhere that has nothing to do with the initial question. He is fantastic company, but I find myself thinking that I am talking to Goldie 2.0 \u2013 clean and relatively serene, an adherent of yoga, meditation and the intensive brand of psychotherapy known as the <a href=\"https://www.hoffmaninstitute.co.uk/about-the-process/\" title=\"\">Hoffman Process</a> \u2013 and boggling at what he must have been like when he was taking vast quantities of \u201cchang\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d0d08599ee7708531e9b805996bd48d634631dcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0d08599ee7708531e9b805996bd48d634631dcd/0_0_3744_5764/650.jpg\" alt=\"Goldie DJing in the 90s\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They thought I was a rock star, because I did a lot of drugs and I was a bit crazy\u2019 ... Goldie DJing in the 90s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naki/Pymca/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is in Britain at least partly because Saturnz Return is receiving the kind of 21st anniversary deluxe reissue treatment afforded classic albums, complete with much talk of its brave experimentation and the vindication of Goldie\u2019s unique vision, a turn of events he seems bemused by. As he points out, no one was talking about the bravery of his unique vision in 1998, when the general consensus seemed to be that Saturnz Return offered conclusive proof Goldie had lost his marbles. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the company trying to recoup the money they lost on it in the first place, or if they genuinely believe in Saturnz Return as an album,\u201d he says. He tried to tell them no, but the label insisted. \u201cThey said: \u2018No, we genuinely think people should hear it now.\u2019 Oh, whatever then. It\u2019s \u2026 bittersweet.\u201d</p> <p>He says the album\u2019s premiere was pretty much as Kill Your Friends described it. He wouldn\u2019t let the label hear the album while he was making it. Given his stories about the sessions, that was probably for the best. In Goldie\u2019s retelling, the making of Saturnz Return was a chaotic saga of technical meltdowns, rows with uncomprehending collaborators and druggy hedonism. At one juncture, Goldie found himself haunted by his reflection in a mirror, which declined to move when he did, a state of affairs that may have had something to do with the cocktail of cocaine and LSD he had recently ingested.</p> <p>Still, the fact that Goldie could lock his label out of the studio while making an album on their substantial dime tells you a lot about how famous he was. He seemed to catapult from respected underground drum\u2019n\u2019bass producer to mainstream celebrity overnight, after the music industry decided the former Clifford Price was the guy built to bring the sound to the masses. You could see why they came to that conclusion: drum\u2019n\u2019bass was futuristic, original, experimental, thrilling music, but the people who made it and played it tended to be low-key, anonymous figures.</p> <p>Goldie, on the other hand, was charismatic. The jewellery and self-designed grills gave him a striking image. He had an extraordinary back story, too: put in care aged three by his mother while his half-brothers remained at home, he shuttled miserably between children\u2019s homes and unsuccessful attempts at fostering, enduring physical and sexual abuse, before running away aged 16 and becoming a successful graffiti artist in the UK and the US, then experiencing a Damascene conversion to dance music after hearing the DJs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AE7jmaRVJM\" title=\"\">Fabio and Grooverider</a> playing in a London club. \u201cThey thought I was a rock star, because I did a lot of drugs and I was a bit crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cRecord companies love that; they want to find another Iggy. There wasn\u2019t any other poster boy for drum\u2019n\u2019bass, let\u2019s face it.\u201d</p> <p>As he points out, he swiftly became more famous than the music he made. His debut album, Timeless, went gold and spawned a hit single in the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZzPBaDArKY\" title=\"\">Inner City Life</a>, but judging by his media profile you would have thought he had just released the biggest-selling album in history. He was everywhere: modelling, acting, designing clothes, hanging around with rock aristocracy and supermodels. He dated Naomi Campbell, then he was engaged to Bj\u00f6rk. David Bowie started turning up at <a href=\"https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2013/04/nightclubbing-metalheadz-at-blue-note\" title=\"\">Metalheadz, the Sunday-night club Goldie ran in pre-gentrification Hoxton</a>, east London, \u201csitting on the steps, rolling cigarettes \u2013 people left him alone\u201d. Madonna wanted him to produce her new album; he declined. \u201cIt might have been great, but I\u2019d have ended up banging her, probably, or some shit like that,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I would have ended up doing copious amounts of probably harder drugs, trying to search for something that wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90e476f103402e73720a4e598442cbb2b3b8bbf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90e476f103402e73720a4e598442cbb2b3b8bbf1/0_0_4773_3094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goldie at Lovebox festival in east London in 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the record company trying to recoup the money they lost on it in the first place, or if they genuinely believe in Saturnz Return\u2019 ... Goldie at Lovebox festival in east London in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simone Joyner/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You could see why his record label thought the follow-up to Timeless might capitalise commercially on its author\u2019s fame, but this was a drastic misreading of the situation. Goldie certainly looked like a man thoroughly enjoying himself, but things were not as they seemed. His celebrity, he says, \u201ctroubled me incessantly\u201d. Not everyone in drum\u2019n\u2019bass was overjoyed at his new position as the genre\u2019s figurehead. He sighs: \u201cThe amount of flak I got from people, going: \u2018Yeah, man, you\u2019ve sold out.\u2019\u201d By his own admission, he had terrible anger issues (\u201cI\u2019d get really horrible, use my fists like clubs, regret it later\u201d), not much helped by a gargantuan cocaine habit that regularly necessitated \u201clooking for dealers to get more gear at six in the morning\u201d.</p> <p>But the real problem, he says, was his childhood. \u201cThere was always this sense of schizophrenia, a sense of this voice, which was me as a boy, this whole exchange about how all this stuff is not going to hide the fact that you\u2019re still lamenting for your mother, is it? I had all the money, but \u2026\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThis really weird thing happened. When I was a kid, there was a day when I was playing with a ball, bouncing it down the road, and it rolled off and went underneath this car on a driveway, a [Reliant] Scimitar; beautiful thing. I went to get it, looked up at this house and the curtains were drawn. I thought: \u2018It\u2019s a sunny day \u2013 if I had that car, I\u2019d be out driving it.\u2019 And then, years later, I\u2019m at home, off my head, there\u2019s the Ferrari, the Porsche, the Cosworth on my driveway, and I look out the window and there\u2019s this kid getting his ball that\u2019s rolled under my Porsche. And I\u2019m inside, in the middle of a fucking week-long bender. I just shook. I thought: \u2018I\u2019m that kid. What have I done?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And so his second album became about exorcising his demons. \u201cAt that time in my life, I had nothing else to give, apart from this voice in my head,\u201d he says. He managed to get an accompanying documentary bankrolled, in which he went in search of his parents. Bowie encouraged his musical endeavours. \u201cHe told me: \u2018Stick to what you believe in \u2013 if you\u2019re going to do it, do it all the way.\u2019\u201d He followed that advice to the letter.

      "bodyText": "In John Niven\u2019s scabrous 2008 novel Kill Your Friends, there is a scene that dramatises the moment in 1997 when Goldie unveiled his second album, Saturnz Return \u2013 specifically, its hour-long opening track, Mother \u2013 to his expectant record company. Goldie is lightly disguised as a character called Rage. Like Goldie, he has survived an appalling childhood of abandonment, neglect and abuse to become the biggest star in Britain\u2019s burgeoning drum\u2019n\u2019bass scene. Like Goldie, he has a penchant for gold jewellery and grills and, like Goldie, there is a great weight of music-industry expectation around his forthcoming album: expectation that goes up in smoke the minute he presses play. \u201cPeople cross and recross their legs, sip their wine and pray for it to end,\u201d offers the novel\u2019s horrendous narrator, Steve Stelfox. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t. As the track approaches the one-hour mark and nothing has emerged that vaguely resembles a hook, or a chorus, or a recognisable melody, it collectively dawns on us that we\u2019re listening to the sonic representation of someone\u2019s mind coming apart. On a positive note, I\u2019m thinking that I must get the number of Rage\u2019s dealer, because the chang he\u2019s on is clearly fucking phenomenal.\u201d \u201cRather a good book,\u201d smiles Goldie, when the subject of Niven\u2019s novel and its depiction of Mother\u2019s premiere comes up. Back in the UK from his home in Thailand and seated in a bar in King\u2019s Cross, central London, he is talking, as is his wont, in lengthy, breathless bursts of puns, anecdotes and malapropisms. His answers zig-zag unpredictably between topics, occasionally contradicting something he said earlier, frequently ending up somewhere that has nothing to do with the initial question. He is fantastic company, but I find myself thinking that I am talking to Goldie 2.0 \u2013 clean and relatively serene, an adherent of yoga, meditation and the intensive brand of psychotherapy known as the Hoffman Process \u2013 and boggling at what he must have been like when he was taking vast quantities of \u201cchang\u201d. He is in Britain at least partly because Saturnz Return is receiving the kind of 21st anniversary deluxe reissue treatment afforded classic albums, complete with much talk of its brave experimentation and the vindication of Goldie\u2019s unique vision, a turn of events he seems bemused by. As he points out, no one was talking about the bravery of his unique vision in 1998, when the general consensus seemed to be that Saturnz Return offered conclusive proof Goldie had lost his marbles. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the company trying to recoup the money they lost on it in the first place, or if they genuinely believe in Saturnz Return as an album,\u201d he says. He tried to tell them no, but the label insisted. \u201cThey said: \u2018No, we genuinely think people should hear it now.\u2019 Oh, whatever then. It\u2019s \u2026 bittersweet.\u201d He says the album\u2019s premiere was pretty much as Kill Your Friends described it. He wouldn\u2019t let the label hear the album while he was making it. Given his stories about the sessions, that was probably for the best. In Goldie\u2019s retelling, the making of Saturnz Return was a chaotic saga of technical meltdowns, rows with uncomprehending collaborators and druggy hedonism. At one juncture, Goldie found himself haunted by his reflection in a mirror, which declined to move when he did, a state of affairs that may have had something to do with the cocktail of cocaine and LSD he had recently ingested. Still, the fact that Goldie could lock his label out of the studio while making an album on their substantial dime tells you a lot about how famous he was. He seemed to catapult from respected underground drum\u2019n\u2019bass producer to mainstream celebrity overnight, after the music industry decided the former Clifford Price was the guy built to bring the sound to the masses. You could see why they came to that conclusion: drum\u2019n\u2019bass was futuristic, original, experimental, thrilling music, but the people who made it and played it tended to be low-key, anonymous figures. Goldie, on the other hand, was charismatic. The jewellery and self-designed grills gave him a striking image. He had an extraordinary back story, too: put in care aged three by his mother while his half-brothers remained at home, he shuttled miserably between children\u2019s homes and unsuccessful attempts at fostering, enduring physical and sexual abuse, before running away aged 16 and becoming a successful graffiti artist in the UK and the US, then experiencing a Damascene conversion to dance music after hearing the DJs Fabio and Grooverider playing in a London club. \u201cThey thought I was a rock star, because I did a lot of drugs and I was a bit crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cRecord companies love that; they want to find another Iggy. There wasn\u2019t any other poster boy for drum\u2019n\u2019bass, let\u2019s face it.\u201d As he points out, he swiftly became more famous than the music he made. His debut album, Timeless, went gold and spawned a hit single in the brilliant Inner City Life, but judging by his media profile you would have thought he had just released the biggest-selling album in history. He was everywhere: modelling, acting, designing clothes, hanging around with rock aristocracy and supermodels. He dated Naomi Campbell, then he was engaged to Bj\u00f6rk. David Bowie started turning up at Metalheadz, the Sunday-night club Goldie ran in pre-gentrification Hoxton, east London, \u201csitting on the steps, rolling cigarettes \u2013 people left him alone\u201d. Madonna wanted him to produce her new album; he declined. \u201cIt might have been great, but I\u2019d have ended up banging her, probably, or some shit like that,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I would have ended up doing copious amounts of probably harder drugs, trying to search for something that wasn\u2019t there.\u201d You could see why his record label thought the follow-up to Timeless might capitalise commercially on its author\u2019s fame, but this was a drastic misreading of the situation. Goldie certainly looked like a man thoroughly enjoying himself, but things were not as they seemed. His celebrity, he says, \u201ctroubled me incessantly\u201d. Not everyone in drum\u2019n\u2019bass was overjoyed at his new position as the genre\u2019s figurehead. He sighs: \u201cThe amount of flak I got from people, going: \u2018Yeah, man, you\u2019ve sold out.\u2019\u201d By his own admission, he had terrible anger issues (\u201cI\u2019d get really horrible, use my fists like clubs, regret it later\u201d), not much helped by a gargantuan cocaine habit that regularly necessitated \u201clooking for dealers to get more gear at six in the morning\u201d. But the real problem, he says, was his childhood. \u201cThere was always this sense of schizophrenia, a sense of this voice, which was me as a boy, this whole exchange about how all this stuff is not going to hide the fact that you\u2019re still lamenting for your mother, is it? I had all the money, but \u2026\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThis really weird thing happened. When I was a kid, there was a day when I was playing with a ball, bouncing it down the road, and it rolled off and went underneath this car on a driveway, a [Reliant] Scimitar; beautiful thing. I went to get it, looked up at this house and the curtains were drawn. I thought: \u2018It\u2019s a sunny day \u2013 if I had that car, I\u2019d be out driving it.\u2019 And then, years later, I\u2019m at home, off my head, there\u2019s the Ferrari, the Porsche, the Cosworth on my driveway, and I look out the window and there\u2019s this kid getting his ball that\u2019s rolled under my Porsche. And I\u2019m inside, in the middle of a fucking week-long bender. I just shook. I thought: \u2018I\u2019m that kid. What have I done?\u2019\u201d And so his second album became about exorcising his demons. \u201cAt that time in my life, I had nothing else to give, apart from this voice in my head,\u201d he says. He managed to get an accompanying documentary bankrolled, in which he went in search of his parents. Bowie encouraged his musical endeavours. \u201cHe told me: \u2018Stick to what you believe in \u2013 if you\u2019re going to do it, do it all the way.\u2019\u201d He followed that advice to the letter. The sessions for Saturnz Return, and Mother in particular, became increasingly elaborate: a 30-piece string section, classically trained child singers, the best session musicians money could buy. He says he knew from the start that it was \u201ca recipe for disaster \u2026 commercial suicide\u201d, but he is still hugely, infectiously enthusiastic about his hour-long opus. \u201cIt starts with this beautiful piece of music that\u2019s the voice of a child who\u2019s not arrived yet. It\u2019s like looking at your mum\u2019s vagina and knowing: \u2018I know this is going to be a very difficult life, but it\u2019s the one life you need to make count.\u2019 And then the mother rips away from him and the whole thing descends, and it\u2019s being cast away, and there\u2019s a sound like a whip, the whip of life, the abuse, the next children\u2019s home and the next one and the next one, all the same. He\u2019s trying to find his way and he becomes a monster, and the beats become really complex and start to grow really fierce, and then it drops all of a sudden into a bell sound, the realisation of life, and, at 48 minutes, we have the solo cello \u2013 what would she have said when I did find her? \u2018I\u2019m sorry, son, for what I did to you\u2019?\u201d His voice finally trails off. \u201cSo, all of that.\u201d His record company didn\u2019t share his enthusiasm. \u201cThey were listening to it, swilling their wine glasses, and it kind of was the end for one [label executive]\u2019s career,\u201d he nods. \u201cThey were expecting something like my first album, and what they got was what happens if you have a guy who\u2019s got more money than sense, more cars on the driveway than girlfriends, an ego and copious amounts of Peruvian flake, and this voice in his head saying: \u2018This is not you, mate, you need to make this album, with this classical impressionistic piece of music on it called Mother, and you\u2019ll get crucified for doing it.\u2019\u201d Critics were so perplexed that largely they chose to ignore the rest of the album \u2013 no mean feat, given that its guests included Bowie, Noel Gallagher and KRS-One \u2013 to concentrate on Mother, wondering aloud what the hell he thought he was doing. Goldie also began to think the documentary about his parents was a mistake. It certainly made for deeply uncomfortable viewing. \u201cGoing to America and sitting with my dad: \u2018Why did you get with my mum, eh?\u2019 Seeing my mum: \u2018Why did you leave me at the fucking post office?\u2019 Chastising them. I think I would have responded better behind closed doors. I don\u2019t think I needed to air my laundry to a world that was never going to understand it in its entirety anyway.\u201d Goldie soldiered on, DJing, releasing music and fronting two documentary series, Classic Goldie in 2009 and Goldie\u2019s Band By Royal Appointment in 2011. The former saw him learn to write scores for an orchestra and culminated in a performance of his piece Sine Tempore at the Proms.

      "body": "<p>For a long time I didn\u2019t know much about my father\u2019s family history. Any details I had gleaned made it sound mercurial. Tempers flared the night before his grandfather\u2019s wedding, for example, and two of the party were shot dead, but the nuptials still took place the next morning. I sensed it always moving, national identity was always shifting; the places they came from in Yugoslavia were constantly renamed and redrawn. I saw images on the news as a child and it seemed better to look away.</p> <p>The first time I went there, we buried my grandfather Misa in Petrovac. It was 1997 and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/nov/10/bosnia-bitter-flawed-peace-deal-dayton-agreement-20-years-on\" title=\"\">Bosnian war had just ended</a>. The supermarket shelves were thick with dust. A kind, elderly woman with no English, charged with looking after me while the adults arranged the funeral, made me spaghetti with a single streak of oil. I was befriended by a gang of children who\u2019d learned English from films. I played with them beside the empty beach and on my last night one boy wrote me a love letter, making good use of a dictionary. It was delivered with a crystal from a glass chandelier, addressed \u201cDear Lydia\u201d, begging me not to leave. \u201cTHIS IS YOUR HOME NOW,\u201d he wrote in vaguely threatening bubble script.</p> <p>I went back to Serbia and Montenegro several times in the intervening years, but it was only when I began writing that I started asking questions. Just as I began work on a novel partly set in Sarajevo, I found a yellowing paperback called Teach Yourself Serbo-Croat on my shelves. I had no idea my grandmother, who died when I was 18, became a published author in 1963. On opening the book, I found a shaky handwritten dedication to me: \u201cTo my granddaughter, hoping she will learn some Serbo-Croat\u201d, dated my 11th birthday. Even by that time, the language had <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/04/10/is-serbo-croatian-a-language\" title=\"\">ceased to exist</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My grandmother called me Katarina, never Olivia.

For my next book I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about Misa. He\u2019d had a stroke when I was very young so it had been difficult to communicate other than looks and holding hands.He was born in 1912. His parents had migrated to Bisbee, then a copper-mining town in Arizona, a few years before. After his father\u2019s death, Misa and his mother came back to Petrovac in what was then still Austria-Hungary but became Yugoslavia in 1918. He became a communist and met my grandmother, also a member of the party but from Belgrade. As students they were both arrested during a riot at Belgrade University for smashing up Nazi-funded labs.</p> <p>My grandmother got a scholarship to study at Edinburgh University just before the outbreak of the second world war. Misa went with her and then the Communist party suggested they spend the war in London. In 1946 they returned to Yugoslavia, this time with my two uncles in tow. Private property had been nationalised and a policeman billeted to live in the Petrovac home.</p> <p>Misa prospered, but, according to my grandparents, non-party people went hungry. They decided to return to the UK, where my father was born. It was a continuous struggle without citizenship. Misa found himself selling nonstick frying pans at fairgrounds. My grandmother got jobs teaching and translating Serbo-Croat and in the Harrods homeware department. When his British passport came through, Misa got a job with a travel company taking tourists to Yugoslavia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/13/bread-is-practically-sacred-how-the-taste-of-home-sustained-my-refugee-parents\">\u2018Bread is practically sacred\u2019: how the taste of home sustained my refugee parents</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He moved back to Sveti Stefan, the next coastal town along from Petrovac, where he worked in a hotel surrounded by the Adriatic but became an alcoholic and was hospitalised. My uncle brought him back to Scotland. He recovered enough to get a job as a security guard in a Kirkaldy shopping centre. Just in time. It wasn\u2019t long before Yugoslavia collapsed. I didn\u2019t know any of this when I went to his funeral. I do remember that my grandmother called me Katarina, never Olivia, even though it was my (concessionary) Slavic middle name. At the time I thought this was outrageous, but have begun to understand.</p> <p>The last time I visited the region I went to Sarajevo. I hadn\u2019t expected the experience of being there to feel so shattering, reading personal testimony, seeing shelled buildings and the mouth of the escape tunnel. Every day I went to the War Childhood museum, an initiative set up by a man exactly my age but who grew up in the siege.

      "bodyText": "For a long time I didn\u2019t know much about my father\u2019s family history. Any details I had gleaned made it sound mercurial. Tempers flared the night before his grandfather\u2019s wedding, for example, and two of the party were shot dead, but the nuptials still took place the next morning. I sensed it always moving, national identity was always shifting; the places they came from in Yugoslavia were constantly renamed and redrawn. I saw images on the news as a child and it seemed better to look away. The first time I went there, we buried my grandfather Misa in Petrovac. It was 1997 and the Bosnian war had just ended. The supermarket shelves were thick with dust. A kind, elderly woman with no English, charged with looking after me while the adults arranged the funeral, made me spaghetti with a single streak of oil. I was befriended by a gang of children who\u2019d learned English from films. I played with them beside the empty beach and on my last night one boy wrote me a love letter, making good use of a dictionary. It was delivered with a crystal from a glass chandelier, addressed \u201cDear Lydia\u201d, begging me not to leave. \u201cTHIS IS YOUR HOME NOW,\u201d he wrote in vaguely threatening bubble script. I went back to Serbia and Montenegro several times in the intervening years, but it was only when I began writing that I started asking questions. Just as I began work on a novel partly set in Sarajevo, I found a yellowing paperback called Teach Yourself Serbo-Croat on my shelves. I had no idea my grandmother, who died when I was 18, became a published author in 1963. On opening the book, I found a shaky handwritten dedication to me: \u201cTo my granddaughter, hoping she will learn some Serbo-Croat\u201d, dated my 11th birthday. Even by that time, the language had ceased to exist. Though I spent so long anglicising my surname, hoping my heritage wouldn\u2019t come up, Yugoslavia has found its way into much of my writing. For my next book I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about Misa. He\u2019d had a stroke when I was very young so it had been difficult to communicate other than looks and holding hands.He was born in 1912. His parents had migrated to Bisbee, then a copper-mining town in Arizona, a few years before. After his father\u2019s death, Misa and his mother came back to Petrovac in what was then still Austria-Hungary but became Yugoslavia in 1918. He became a communist and met my grandmother, also a member of the party but from Belgrade. As students they were both arrested during a riot at Belgrade University for smashing up Nazi-funded labs. My grandmother got a scholarship to study at Edinburgh University just before the outbreak of the second world war. Misa went with her and then the Communist party suggested they spend the war in London. In 1946 they returned to Yugoslavia, this time with my two uncles in tow. Private property had been nationalised and a policeman billeted to live in the Petrovac home. Misa prospered, but, according to my grandparents, non-party people went hungry. They decided to return to the UK, where my father was born. It was a continuous struggle without citizenship. Misa found himself selling nonstick frying pans at fairgrounds. My grandmother got jobs teaching and translating Serbo-Croat and in the Harrods homeware department. When his British passport came through, Misa got a job with a travel company taking tourists to Yugoslavia. He moved back to Sveti Stefan, the next coastal town along from Petrovac, where he worked in a hotel surrounded by the Adriatic but became an alcoholic and was hospitalised. My uncle brought him back to Scotland. He recovered enough to get a job as a security guard in a Kirkaldy shopping centre. Just in time. It wasn\u2019t long before Yugoslavia collapsed. I didn\u2019t know any of this when I went to his funeral. I do remember that my grandmother called me Katarina, never Olivia, even though it was my (concessionary) Slavic middle name. At the time I thought this was outrageous, but have begun to understand. The last time I visited the region I went to Sarajevo. I hadn\u2019t expected the experience of being there to feel so shattering, reading personal testimony, seeing shelled buildings and the mouth of the escape tunnel. Every day I went to the War Childhood museum, an initiative set up by a man exactly my age but who grew up in the siege. Studying the exhibits \u2013 personal items donated by those who were children during the conflict \u2013 I was struck not only by the horror, but by how familiar their parallel lives seemed. One letter in particular stopped me in my tracks. That bubble script. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 September 2019 to make it clear that the reference to \u201cnon-party people went hungry\u201d was based on the recollection of the author\u2019s grandparents. \u2022 Olivia Sudjic is a novelist",

      "bodyText": "Furious last minute lobbying for additional funding for schools, colleges and pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) is under way in the run-up to next week\u2019s spending review. Leaders of the biggest teaching unions had an hour-long meeting with the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Thursday, and made their case for more money for struggling schools as part of a long-term funding plan. Letters have also been sent to the Department for Education (DfE) and the Treasury, urging the government to boost funding for special needs and post-16 education, which have been hard hit in recent years. Earlier this week the Guardian revealed confidential plans by the government for a raft of education measures including billions of pounds in funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools, due to be announced in time for the start of the new school year. Williamson told union leaders he would not comment on the leaked document, which included plans for an extra \u00a32.8bn for primary and secondary schools up to the age of 16, including \u00a3800m for children with SEND. Details of an extra \u00a3800m for sixth form and further education colleges were said to be still under discussion with the Treasury. Williamson said: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working with all our education unions on our shared goal of giving children and young people of all ages the best possible education and laying the foundations for success in whatever path they choose.\u201d A cross-party group of 93 MPs has signed a letter to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, urging him to prioritise education funding for 16- to 18-year-olds.

      "bodyText": "The former Tasmanian anti-discrimination commissioner, Robin Banks, has branded the religious discrimination bill \u201can extraordinary foray in the culture wars\u201d which would license offensive views about women, racial minorities and disabled people. Banks has joined LGBT advocates and the Greens who have denounced the bill because it overrides federal and state laws by determining that religious speech in good faith cannot amount to unlawful discrimination. While Labor has so far held fire on the substance of the bill \u2013 complaining of insufficient consultation \u2013 the Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick has questioned whether it addresses a real problem. Religious groups and Coalition conservatives mostly welcomed the laws, but some signalled a desire for further institutional exemptions to federal discrimination laws \u2013 the subject of a separate Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry \u2013 or a positive right to freedom of religion, which the attorney general, Christian Porter, has already ruled out. The draft bill overrides all state laws to protect religious speech provided it is not malicious and does not \u201charass, vilify or incite hatred\u201d and expressly overrides Tasmania\u2019s laws, which prevent speech that offends, insults or humiliates people based on protected characteristics. Anna Brown, the chief executive of Equality Australia, said the bill \u201cpresents a risk to LGBTIQ people, women and other vulnerable groups by overriding every other anti-discrimination law in the country\u201d. Banks said it was \u201centirely incoherent in a diverse, pluralistic society that religious speech is protected where other speech isn\u2019t\u201d. Banks said Sheik Taj Aldin al-Hilali\u2019s comparison of women to \u201cuncovered meat\u201d, religious views that disability was \u201cthe product of sin\u201d or that a particular ethnic group was inferior would all gain \u201ca special cloak of protection\u201d under the proposed law. In 2017 the Tasmanian government attempted to exempt religious speech from the prohibition on offending, insulting or humiliating language, but the bid failed after opposition from disability advocates and women\u2019s groups. Jenny Dixon, the manager of Speak Out Advocacy, said her organisation fought that plan because it feared the change \u201csends a message to the community that denigration of people with disability is acceptable\u201d. On the new bill, Dixon said: \u201cAnything that waters down protective legislation should be viewed with concern. It potentially deprives people of an avenue to bring issues to Equal Opportunity Tasmania.\u201d Banks said: \u201cPeople think it\u2019s just words but I\u2019ve dealt with people who are emotionally scarred by words, who could now be marginalised at their work, at their school or university\u201d. \u201cReligious speech is so privileged it will allow people to engage in racist, ableist, sexist anti-LGBTI speech.\u201d The Human Rights Law Centre\u2019s chief executive, Hugh de Kretser, agreed that the bill \u201cintroduces unjustified carve-outs for people to express discriminatory views and to override state and territory protections which ensure fair treatment, particularly for women accessing abortion services\u201d. The centre is concerned the bill overrides state rules that require doctors with a conscientious objection to abortion to refer patients to another health service. One of its senior lawyers, Adrianne Walters, said the bill \u201cundermines women\u2019s reproductive health\u201d by allowing doctors to \u201cabandon their patients\u201d in jurisdictions such as South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales. \u201cThe bill unjustifiably prioritises a doctor\u2019s personal religious beliefs over the right of women to access the healthcare they need.\u201d \u201cThe bill makes it even more important for the NSW abortion bill to have strong referral provisions.\u201d A constitutional law expert, Luke Beck, said the bill protected the speech of atheists \u201conly on topics of religion\u201d but protected all religious beliefs \u201con any subject whatsoever\u201d, granting a \u201cbigger sword\u201d to them. On Friday Patrick told ABC\u2019s AM he had not seen the bill but would \u201calmost certainly\u201d seek to refer it to a Senate inquiry. \u201cOur current position is that we are not sure that there is a problem, only the perception of a problem, so we first have to be convinced that indeed there is a controversy to be solved by a new law,\u201d he said. Nationals MP George Christensen said the new law would \u201cprotect Australians who express their religious beliefs from being subject to state-based anti-free speech discrimination laws and from being hauled before kangaroo court anti-discrimination tribunals\u201d. Liberal MP Craig Kelly said the new law would enshrine a \u201ccommonsense\u201d approach and congratulated Porter for opening the process for further consultation. Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells was more critical, telling Radio National the bills were \u201clikely to fall far short\u201d of addressing religious institutions\u2019 concerns. \u201cThe bill deals with discrimination on the basis of religious belief only in key areas of public life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does not create a positive right to freedom of religion which is what religious leaders, experts and stakeholders have been calling for.\u201d Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill accused the government of inviting religious leaders to a \u201cphoto opportunity\u201d on Thursday when the laws were released, but failing to conduct proper consultation, which is set to last just five weeks. \u201cAs a Labor politician of faith, committed to family, they\u2019re telling me they\u2019re disgusted there isn\u2019t a bipartisan effort to discuss the substance of this bill before it was released,\u201d she said. \u201cThe lack of consultation has led to the release of a draft that is not meeting expectations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The outlook for the Great Barrier Reef has deteriorated from poor to very poor according to an exhaustive government report that warns the window of opportunity to improve the natural wonder\u2019s future \u201cis now\u201d. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s outlook report, published every five years, finds coral reefs have declined to a very poor condition and there is widespread habitat loss and degradation affecting fish, turtles and seabirds. It warns the plight of the reef will not improve unless there is urgent national and global action to address the climate crisis, which it described as its greatest threat. The report says rising sea temperatures and extreme events linked to climate change, such as the marine heatwaves that caused mass coral bleaching in the northern two-thirds of the reef in 2016 and 2017, are the most immediate risks. Other major threats include farming pollution, coastal development and human use, such as illegal fishing. The report says water quality is improving too slowly and continues to affect many inshore areas, largely due to farming practices that had not improved rapidly enough. \u201cWithout additional local, national and global action on the greatest threats, the overall outlook for the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s ecosystem will remain very poor, with continuing consequences for its heritage values also,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe window of opportunity to improve the reef\u2019s long-term future is now.\u201d The authority\u2019s chief executive, Josh Thomas, said the reef was widely recognised as one of the best managed marine protected areas in the world and its world heritage values remained intact, but it was at a critical point in its history. \u201cWhile the reef is already experiencing the impacts of climate change, its future is one we can change \u2013 and are committed to changing,\u201d he said. The report maps the health of the reef, which it says has declined from what was described as a crossroads in 2009 to \u201cunder pressure\u201d in 2014 to being a \u201cchanged and less resilient reef\u201d in 2019. It says not all areas of the reef have been equally affected and the challenge to restore the reef is big, but not insurmountable. It would require action to effectively address the climate crisis and effective implementation of the government\u2019s 2050 reef plan. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the reef had been hit over the past five years by two mass coral bleachings, several cyclones, an ongoing crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak and the impacts of climate change. She said the \u201cvery poor\u201d outlook was something \u201cwe can change and are committed to changing\u201d. Other key findings of the report include that: seagrass meadows are in poor condition; some species populations are being substantially affected by habitat loss and degradation; the size of the reef is becoming a less effective buffer to widespread and cumulative impacts; reef-dependent economies need to prepare for the impacts of a less diverse ecosystem caused by rising ocean temperatures. The outlook report was one of two major reports published about the reef on Friday. A separate report card on the condition of inshore reefs released by the federal and state governments rated their condition in 2017-18 as a \u201cD\u201d, largely due to poor water quality driven by land management practices including farming. The reports come amid a campaign by farmers in Queensland against state government plans to tighten regulations on agricultural run-off that flows into reef catchments. Information in the report will form part of the evidence considered by the Unesco world heritage committee when it examines the reef\u2019s health and status next year. Australia successfully campaigned in 2015 for the reef\u2019s world heritage listing not to be considered in danger. The Guardian reported this week that the government was pushing Unesco to resolve how it would deal with climate impacts on world heritage properties, including the Great Barrier Reef. Richard Leck, from WWF-Australia, said the outlook report was a sombre reminder of the challenges facing the reef. He said solutions were available and must be included in a revamped Reef 2050 plan due from the federal and state governments next year. He said the plan must take climate change seriously and Queensland needed to pass regulations to reduce farm runoff. \u201cThe science is irrefutable. The time for delay is over,\u201d he said. Jon Brodie, a professorial fellow at James Cook University in Townsville, said the report showed that, while there were some small areas of progress, Australia was failing the reef. \u201cOverall, there is very little good to report whatsoever,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "In the 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Doreen Mohaupt has experienced the downsides and the upsides of German reunification. Born in the coal-rich Lusatia Lake District close to the Polish border, the 43-year-old was raised in an area that was once the pride of the socialist East German economy, employing about 80,000 workers. When the old economic order collapsed, so did the local coal industry. Her father, a construction manager, was one of the 90% of the workforce who found themselves without a job. For Mohaupt, however, the structural upheaval that followed the cold war was a challenge she came to relish. An urban planner employed by the city of Cottbus, she now leads a team of 37 civil servants focused on regenerating the area. \u201cOf course, everyone\u2019s natural instinct is that they don\u2019t like change,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think the attitudes of my generation of East Germans are different, especially among women. I sometimes feel we are like these amoeba that can always adjust to their surroundings.\u201d Many women like Mohaupt have managed to adapt to a changing economy, so much so that women in Cottbus buck the national trend and earn 17% more than men. But it is the voting intentions of many of the men left behind by the collapse of the coal industry that is likely to dominate Sunday\u2019s regional elections, which could result in the rightwing populists Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) becoming the area\u2019s largest party. Deindustrialisation has left a generation of men feeling emasculated, angry and open to the policy messages of the far right. With Germany moving toward phasing out coal power by 2038, the Cottbus area is facing the loss of a further 20,000 to 22,000 jobs directly and indirectly linked to the mining sector. In Brandenburg and Saxony, the AfD has realistic hopes of toppling the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD) and centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as the strongest force. It has been forecast to triple its vote since 2014 in Cottbus, largely because the party has recalibrated its anti-immigration message toward railing against the government\u2019s green agenda. \u201cCoal is Lusatia\u2019s last anchor,\u201d said Marianne Spring-R\u00e4umsch\u00fcssel, the AfD\u2019s candidate for the region. \u201cWe need industry, because without industry there won\u2019t be jobs in administration either.\u201d Her party opposes the phase-out altogether, and she said she mistrusted the government\u2019s promise to cushion job losses with \u20ac40bn in structural funds for hard-hit regions. \u201cPeople in East Germany can read between the lines,\u201d said Spring-R\u00e4umsch\u00fcssel, whose party\u2019s campaign slogan, Vollende die Wende \u2013 \u201ccomplete the peaceful revolution\u201d - controversially co-opts the language of the 1989 dissident movement. \u201cWe knew back then that those on the top weren\u2019t being truthful with us, and now I\u2019ve got a feeling that they aren\u2019t being truthful with us either\u201d.

Although the AfD has the lowest proportion of female MPs among any party in the Bundestag and adheres to what she calls a \u201ctraditional image of the family\u201d, Spring-R\u00e4umsch\u00fcssel said her party still honoured women\u2019s issues, largely through its stance on immigration. The 2015 refugee crisis, she said, had brought an influx of people into Germany who came from countries with \u201clower levels of education\u201d and more traditional views of the role of women. \u201cI am a woman\u2019s libber through and through, you can see that.

      "bodyText": "Public health experts are warning the spread of measles to the Pacific Islands is \u201cinevitable\u201d as the most serious outbreak in 20 years grips New Zealand. More than 700 cases of measles have been recorded in Auckland this year, with more than 400 of them in the more deprived suburbs of south Auckland. New Zealand\u2019s ministry of health is desperately trying to contain the outbreak to stop it spreading around the country and around the Pacific region. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has taken the unprecedented step of warning anyone unvaccinated to stay away from the country\u2019s largest city, home to 1.7 million people. \u201cIt\u2019s a considerable risk that it spreads to the Pacific Islands now, there is particular concern for countries such as Samoa, Tonga and the Cook Islands which have lower vaccination rates,\u201d said Dr Teuila Percival, an expert in Pacific Health who works at south Auckland\u2019s largest hospital, Middlemore and also runs a Pacific health centre. On Thursday, Auckland Regional Public Health Service said they had been notified that a passenger with measles had travelled to Auckland from Samoa on an Air New Zealand flight. The traveller was unaware they had measles at the time, and soon after arriving in Auckland went into isolation. While the vaccination coverage rate for two-year-olds in New Zealand is at 91% \u2013 comparable to Australia \u2013 the coverage rate for those aged 16-29 is believed to be lower.

The government warned anyone thinking of travelling to Auckland to update their vaccination two weeks before visiting, or else stay away. New Zealand was praised by the World Health Organisation for eradicating measles only two years ago. Now that status is under threat, with experts saying if the current outbreak continues New Zealand could lose its WHO eradication status by March next year. The department of health said the outbreak would be upgraded to an epidemic if it spread to another region of New Zealand. Cases of childhood measles are surging to shocking levels around the world, led by 10 countries that account for three-quarters of the rise. Amid warnings of \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d for children if the disease continues to spread unchecked, a worldwide survey by the UN children\u2019s agency, Unicef, said 98 countries around the globe reported a rise in measles cases in 2018 compared with 2017.",

But we were wrong. The academic and author Kyla Schuller argues that rather than betraying their womanhood, these women were performing it. Schuller says White Womanhood has been a key stabilising feature of western civilisation. Although not as visible as that of their male counterparts, their role was nonetheless equally pivotal to the success of European settler-colonialism. White women, Schuller writes, smooth over \u201cthe flow of sensation and feeling that makes up the public sphere, ensuring that white men \u2026 are susceptible only to further progress\u201d. In other words, White Womanhood acts as a buffer between whites and non-whites. Serving as the virtuous, innocent face of western civilisation, white women have historically kept power firmly in white hands by defending and denying its violence. Or as the Australian Indigenous academic and author Aileen Moreton-Robinson so succinctly put it in Talkin\u2019 Up To the White Woman: \u201cWhite women civilised while white men brutalised.\u201d The removal of Indigenous children from their families both in Australia and the United States, for example, was largely implemented by white women. These colonial maternalists, as the historian Margaret Jacobs dubbed them, learned to leverage their status as both a privileged and subordinate class in order to \u201csimultaneously collaborate with and confound colonial aims\u201d. The stolen generations was \u201clargely a feminine domain, defined primarily around mothering [and] targeted at Indigenous women\u201d. By framing the removal of Indigenous children as \u201cwomen\u2019s work for women\u201d, the maternal colonialists flouted the rule against white women working outside the home, and secured white domination over the Indigenous population. How and why has this history of the role played by white women been largely neglected in favour of a narrative that positions colonialism and imperialism as the domain of white men alone? Part of the answer lies in the manipulation of discourse. Our tendency is to interpret concepts such as White Man and White Man\u2019s Burden too literally. Although white society hinged on a strict binary between men and women, the term \u201cman\u201d was and remains a catch-all for all genders. In other words, the White Man and the White Man\u2019s Burden refer not only to white males but to white society as a whole. White women were also \u201cburdened\u201d with the responsibility to civilise and subjugate the inferior races of the world, a burden many took on with great gusto. White women were not bystanders to the global colonial project, but because they were subordinate to and often suffered at the hands of white men, their role has largely slipped under the radar in favour of a misleading discourse that has placed them on almost equal footing with the populations they helped to colonise. Today we see white feminists adopt anti-racism discourse to denounce \u201cmediocre white men\u201d and \u201cwhite male supremacy\u201d, thus continuing the legacy of both confounding and collaborating with colonial aims by temporarily distancing themselves from white power. By pinning all culpability on white men, white women \u2013 whether wittingly or unwittingly \u2013 whitewash their role in colonisation and the oppression of women of colour by equating their gender oppression with colonialism. This is what black and brown women mean when we say we cannot separate our gender from our race: we have never been oppressed only by patriarchy, and so a feminism that claims to be for all women must be built on an explicitly anti-racist platform.

Wong, a state upper house member until earlier this year, helped organise a Chinese Friends of Labor fundraising dinner featuring Shorten, the then federal Labor leader, and other high-profile party figures shortly before the 2015 state election. That dinner is at the centre of an investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, which has already led to the suspension of the Labor\u2019s NSW general secretary, Kaila Murnain. The inquiry has heard allegations and evidence that Huang \u2013 a property developer and prolific political donor \u2013 gave $100,000 in cash to the party but his contributions were masked by a series of straw, or fake, donors. Wong was pressed on Friday about whether he sold the head table to Huang for $100,000. Huang was pictured on the night sitting with Shorten, the then NSW Labor leader, Luke Foley, Wong and other guests. Icac\u2019s counsel assisting, Scott Robertson, pushed Wong from the outset of his evidence about whether he had ever told anyone that he had sold the head table for $100,000. Robertson was forced to ask the same question at least six times and accused Wong of seeking to evade answering it. \u201cHave you ever said to anyone that the head table for the Chinese Friends of Labor dinner on the 12th March 2015 had been taken for $100,000?\u201d Robertson asked.

He said the money was to be used to help cover its expenses in organising lunar new year events and media costs. Wong later conceded that the Labor official who had given him consent would not have had the authority to speak on behalf of Labor on the matter. Earlier evidence to Icac suggested that in September 2016 a distressed Wong approached Murnain to say Huang had donated large sums of money to the Labor party and others had claimed to have donated when they had not. Murnain said she had sought the advice of the federal Labor senator Sam Dastyari, who was then engulfed in his own scandal involving Huang and his company, Yuhu Group.

He came to New York desperately seeking some form, but many question marks remain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"698869359e5510edd5e1ae90d2b288359ac7d327\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/698869359e5510edd5e1ae90d2b288359ac7d327/0_0_2488_1572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zverev beats Tiafoe 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zverev beats Tiafoe 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T19:32:23.260Z\">at 8.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d68240e8f08a5e74d697e8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T19:18:28.955Z\">8.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The 6ft 6in Zverev is now standing tall on Arthur Ashe</strong>, where his 20th ace of the day gets him to 30-0 and two points away from a 5-2 fifth-set lead over Tiafoe.

      "bodyText": "And that just about wraps things up for today. Stay tuned for a full report on Coco Gauff\u2019s progression to the third round. Here\u2019s something on Nick Kyrgios in the meantime. Until next time. And Coco Gauff is through to the third round after a gripping three-set win over T\u00edmea Babos. The crowd is going wild here on Armstrong. She next will face defending champion Naomi Osaka on Saturday night in a match that almost positively will be held under the lights on Arthur Ashe Stadium. What does she think about it? \u201cI don\u2019t have any thoughts on it right now,\u201d Gauff says to ESPN\u2019s Tom Rinaldi in an on-court interview, \u201cbecause I have to play doubles tomorrow with Caty (McNally) and I\u2019m really focused on that.\u201d Squeaky bum time in the decider. Babos falls behind 0-30 and double-faults for 15-40, but fights her way through some lengthy rallies (and another double fault on game point) to hold for 4-all. Then Gauff holds easily and Babos will serve to stay in the match. Babos and Gauff trade holds once more and the Hungarian will serve at 3-4. Simply breathtaking shotmaking on Ashe. Two more results from around the grounds. On Ashe, Wozniacki has served out a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Collins. On Court 13, Tennys Sandgren has won 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-4 over Vasek Pospisil. Babos holds and Gauff responds, saving a pair of break points for good measure. But that only tells the half of it. Exquisite shotmaking and extended rallies with both players using all of the court. The crowd is loving it. Babos to serve at 2-3 after the changeover. On Ashe, Wozniacki finally earns a break and Collins will serve to stay in the tournament at 3-5 in the third. Both players trade comfortable holds and Babos will serve at 1-2 in the third. The Hungarian continues pound Gauff\u2019s forehand and so far it\u2019s held up, but not without a few scratchy moments. Meanwhile on Ashe, Wozniacki and Collins are at 2-all in the third. Babos closes out the second set, 6-2. Clearly it feels like the momentum has shifted. Then Gauff falls behind 15-40 on her serve in the opening game of the third and a hush falls over Armstrong. But the teenager digs deep, serving her way out of trouble and benefitting from a couple of unforced errors for the hold. Chants of \u201cHere we go, Coco, here we go!\u201d ring through the mostly full 14,053-seat arena during the changeover. Over on Armstrong, Coco Gauff has come apart a bit against T\u00edmea Babos. The 15-year-old American was serving at 3-all when her forehand began to misfire, leading to a break of serve. The errors continued into the next game as Babos, so much more patient now and making Gauff hit more balls than in the opener, held for 5-3. The 15-year-old then to stay in the second set, leaving Babos to serve to force a decider after the change of ends. And Nick Kyrgios is through to the third round of the US Open after a 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 win over Antoine Hoang. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t without a bit of histrionics, but the 28th-seeded Aussie will be licking his chops when he looks at his quarter of the draw moving forward. He\u2019s one of only three seeds remaining in this entire quarter along with No 13 Gael Monfils and No 24 Matteo Berrettini. He\u2019ll next face Russia\u2019s Andrey Rublev, who advanced on a walkover today. Hoang holds easily and Kyrgios does the same, crushing his 22nd ace of the night (to Hoang\u2019s one). Or so we think. After Kyrgios appeared to win the game, the chair umpire called the score (\u201cKyrgios leads 5-4\u201d) ... moments later acknowledging that Hoang had challenged the point. Successfully, of course. Kyrgios is furious at the late challenge and calls for the supervisor, ultimately agreeing to play on and winning the game on the next point. Now \u2013 finally \u2013 the Frenchman will serve to stay in the tournament at 3-5. Never a dull moment! Kyrgios falls behind love-30 then 15-40 on his serve, then sprays a forehand from the baseline. He\u2019s lost one of his breaks, but remains in control with Hoang serving at 2-4. Elsewhere, Gauff has taken the first set from Babos on Armstrong, while Danielle Collins has done the same against Caroline Wozniacki on Ashe. Kyrgios holds at love, then breaks Hoang yet again for a commanding double-break lead in the third. The Frenchman\u2019s serve continues to betray him with a pair of double-faults \u2013 including one on game point \u2013 before Kyrgios seals it with a gorgeous backhand passing winner down the line. Now the Aussie will serve at 4-1 with the third round within touching distance. And Kyrgios breaks right back to nose ahead yet again. It\u2019s the third straight service break in as many games to open the third set. Now the Aussie will serve at 6-4, 6-2, 2-1 to consolidate. Meanwhile on Armstrong, Coco Gauff has raced out to a 5-2 lead against T\u00edmea Babos. Well, how about this. Hoang manages to earn his first three break-point chances of the match, double-faulting on the first and missing an overhand on the second but converting the third with a forehand volley winner to break right back for 1-all in the third. Signs of life, but he\u2019s got a long way to go from two sets down. We\u2019ve seen a bit of an influx of fans on Grandstand with Thanasi Kokkinakis\u2019s withdrawal having adjusted ticket-holders\u2019 priorities a bit. But the truth is they\u2019re not arriving to much of a contest. Kyrgios has broken Hoang in the opening game of the third and appears to have the match in hand. Bosh bosh bash! Kyrgios loses a couple of points but he breezes to the game and the set in the end thanks to some big serving after Hoang took the game to deuce. Kyrgios leads 2-0. Bryan will now be in charge. Hoang gets another game on the board but it will take something special from him to get back into the match. Kyrgios wins the next game to love. This isn\u2019t going to last long. The Australian looks in great nick. Another break to Kyrgios who looks to be enjoying himself out there, which is nice. He leads the second set 4-1. Kyrgios first easily holds his own service game and looks to be on the way to a break but Hoang recovers to hold. Kyrgios breaks first up in the second set, too, which is good news for the Australian who won it with some fine work after taking the game to deuce. Krygios takes the first set with a great serve which Hoang cannot lay a glove on. That\u2019s it from me for today, Bryan will be taking over the baton shortly. Phew. It\u2019s been a busy one. See you again tomorrow ... Five games in, this is all rather business-like from Kyrgios, who leads 3-2 with the break against Hoang, who\u2019s making his US Open debut at the age of 23. For Kyrgios, only a year older, this is his seventh time in New York. But for all his talent, he\u2019s never been beyond the third round. That could change this year, because the way his quarter of the draw has opened up, he has a great chance of making the semis. It\u2019s up to Kyrgios whether he wants to make the most of the opportunity. Some match reports for your perusal: There\u2019s already been a bit of Kyrgios-related controversy, of course: That\u2019s it for the day session on the two main courts, with Rafael Nadal, Caroline Wozniacki, Coco Gauff and Marin Cilic to come in the night session. Elsewhere Jelena Ostapenko has defeated Alison Riske 6-4, 6-3; Andrey Rublev, who got to the Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas in round one, has benefitted from Giles Simon\u2019s retirement; Belinda Bencic has won in three sets against Alize Cornet; Denis Shapovalov, who beat Felix Auger Aliassime in the one-sided battle of the young Canadians, is a set up against Switzerland\u2019s Henri Laaksonen; the fabulous Thomas Fabbiano, who took out Dominic Thiem on Tuesday, is two sets to the good in his match; and with the sun setting on Grandstand, Nick Kyrgios, with a possible suspension hanging over him for calling the ATP corrupt, is just getting started against France\u2019s Antoine Hoang. Townsend talks: It gives me so much confidence to know I can do it. When I played her before I think I played not to lose, but today I played to win. I don\u2019t really think I can say on TV what was going on in my head. ... and they\u2019re level again at 4-4, before Halep blinks with a forehand she should really have put away! So Townsend has the mini-break at 5-4, and has a further two match points when Halep\u2019s angled backhand doesn\u2019t dip quickly enough and lands wide. Townsend puffs out her cheeks, serve-volleys \u2013 of course \u2013 and Halep\u2019s backhand barely reaches the net! Townsend is almost in tears. Kobe Bryant is on his feet, as are the rest of the Arthur Ashe crowd. Halep, who was absolutely unbeatable at Wimbledon seven weeks ago, is out in the second round in the shock of the US Open so far! It\u2019s a shame to see such a popular champion exit so early, but it\u2019s wonderful to see Townsend, playing such a throw-back game, pull off the biggest win of her career having come through qualifying. Townsend is doing her best Pete Sampras impression with the amount she\u2019s serve-volleying. There are small swings in momentum at the start of the breaker. Townsend goes 2-0 ahead. Halep hurtles back for 2-2, before double faulting. It\u2019s 3-3 as they change ends ... Halep, having saved those two match points, saves a break point to somehow scramble 6-5 ahead. You\u2019ve got to feel for Townsend, who must have all sorts of thoughts racing through her head at the changeover. Halep, meanwhile, is jabbing at her own head with her fingers after conceding the first point on Townsend\u2019s serve. Halep\u2019s angst on court is in such contrast to her easy demeanour off it. The jabbing does the job though. Because Halep now has a match point of her own, at 30-40. Townsend once again goes for the serve-volley approach but doesn\u2019t even need to volley because Halep\u2019s return is well out. Deuce. And then with the court wide open, Halep miscues! Advantage Townsend. Game Townsend. We\u2019ve got a tie-break to settle this, which is no less than this captivating contest deserves. What with everything that\u2019s been going on at Flushing Meadows, I\u2019ve not mentioned Andy Murray\u2019s defeat at the Rafa Nadal Open in Mallorca. He\u2019s been beaten in the last 16 of the Challenger event, losing 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3) to the world No 240, Matteo Viola. In his third singles tournament since hip surgery, Murray struggled physically in the third set, needing two medical time-outs for cramping. Murray admitted afterwards he was \u201cvery tired\u201d and \u201cphysically needs to get better\u201d. A superb volley at full stretch moves Townsend within two points of a memorable victory. The crowd are on their feet when Townsend brings up two match points. But they should save the standing ovation, because a double fault and Halep winner follow. From 40-15 to deuce. Townsend\u2019s still got the guts to serve-volley, but the serve is weak, Halep gets enough on the return, and Townsend nets the volley. A break point for Halep, who attempts to pass her opponent ... but Townsend reads it and puts away a bullet of a volley. Deuce. Halep pulls off the pass on the next point, however, and then breaks! Townsend has seen two match points come and go and they\u2019re back on serve at 5-5! Halep gets a bit of luck at 15-30 to avoid going two match points down. Instead it\u2019s 30-all. The crowd are gasping when Townsend\u2019s backhand flies off the net before falling into the tramlines. 40-30. Townsend has a good chance to take the game to deuce with the volley, but she nets. She hasn\u2019t missed many of those today. But the American qualifier, ranked 116 in the world, will come out after the break at 5-4 to take out the world No 4. You\u2019ve got to admire the way Townsend is serve-volleying her way to victory. She\u2019s just not letting up against the Wimbledon champion, who dominated all around her at SW19 only seven weeks ago. Just as I type that, Townsend tightens up with a double fault. But it\u2019s a minor wobble. She closes out the game on the next point and Halep is staring down the barrel of defeat, trailing 5-3, having to hold serve to stay in the tournament. What guts from Townsend. The home hope goes for all-out attack to break Halep for 3-2, before recovering from 0-40 down on her own serve to consolidate the break. Bet Halep is wishing right now that she\u2019d not given Townsend some tips after beating her at the French Open last year: News on tomorrow\u2019s schedule: Roger Federer v Dan Evans will be the first match on Ashe in the day session, followed by Serena Williams v Karolina Muchova. The night session is Sofia Kenin v Madison Keys, then Novak Djokovic v Denis Kudla. News on another two Americans: John Isner, who\u2019s had more than his fair share of injury problems this year, has advanced, in three tight sets against Germany\u2019s Jan-Lennard Struff. Marin Cilic, the 2014 champion, could be next. And Jenson Brooksby, the 18-year-old from California, has been given a lesson by the 17th seed, Nikoloz Basilashvili. Brooksby led by a set and double break before Basilashvili\u2019s experience told in a four-set win. Townsend is putting Halep under such pressure that the Romanian resorts to thumping her racket into the court not once, not twice, but thrice. But despite her show of anger, Halep manages to hold serve to nudge 2-1 ahead in the decider. Meanwhile Townsend\u2019s compatriot Alison Riske, who defeated the player formerly known as Garbine Muguruza in the first round, is serving to stay in the first set against the 2017 French Open champion, Jelena Ostapenko, at 5-4 down. It was an incredibly strange start to that match with Ostapenko hitting seven double faults but still holding serve. Riske can\u2019t hold and Ostapenko secures the set 6-4. Andreescu, by the way, has cracked the top 10 courtesy of that win. The 19-year-old Canadian, who started the year outside the top 150, is such a talent. Back on Ashe, Townsend is serving for the second set against Halep. The Wimbledon champion, no less. Townsend comes through comfortably, and lets out an impassioned \u201cCOME ON\u201d. As well she might. That was tremendous from Townsend, who takes the set 6-3 to force Halep to a third set for the second consecutive match. Kobe Bryant, having watched Naomi Osaka on Louis Armstrong earlier, has made his way on to Ashe and must be enjoying this fightback from his fellow American. While I\u2019ve been away, there have been wins for Stan Wawrinka, Bianca Andreescu and Daniil Medvedev. Wawrinka secured his sixth win on the spin against his opponent Jeremy Chardy, progressing 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (3), 6-3; the exciting Andreescu, some people\u2019s tip for the title, beat Belgium\u2019s Kirsten Flipkens 6-3, 7-5; while an ailing Medvedev, despite cramping badly in the third and fourth sets, somehow overcame Hugo Dellien 6-3, 7-5, 5-7, 6-3. So all those matches the Russian\u2019s played over the past month seem to be catching up with him. \u201cSorry mate, I was really cramping, I was not making jokes, sorry,\u201d Medvedev told Dellien at the net afterwards. ... don\u2019t even get me started Will. Some low life decided it would be a good idea to help themselves to my dinner that I\u2019d left in the fridge, so I\u2019ve been wandering around King\u2019s Cross in a state of wronged hanger trying to find something else while considering how I tackle this great whodunnit. Any suggestions gratefully received. Good news! Katy is back! Do not ask about her dinner ... Townsend volleys her way into a 30:0 lead but then the next one is lobbed wide to give Halep hope. Halep reacts to three fine volleys form Townsend before sending one straight past her to level things. Another fierce volley from the net completes the game. Townsend leads the second set 4-1. Halep with some fine defence keeps the point alive but Townsend volleys to level things at 15:15. Halep double faults to allow Townsend to level things at 30:30, which is not what she wanted, then the Romania whacks a forehand very, very wide to offer a break point and Townsend takes the game. Townsend leads the second set 3-1. Not wanting any more of this messing around, Halep rushes into a 0:30 lead and then a perfect backhand across court gives her break point. Halep hits some fine shots in a rally, ending with a Townsend volleying into the net to give up a break. Townsend leads the second set 2-1. Halep is on the verge of a win but two poor shots take it to deuce. The advantage is gifted to Townsend with a unforced error from Halep, who whacks a forehand wide. Halep gets away with it as her opponent sends one long. A lovely volley from the American forces Halep to lift it back over her head but it flies past the baseline. Townsend breaks to lead in the second set 2-0. Townsend is getting a bit sloppy. She stretches for a volley and doesn\u2019t come close to controlling it, sending it very wide. The American makes up for it on the next point with a lovely volley to make it 30:30 and then smashes a winner. She then takes her first game in five as Halep lifts one long. Halep is really speeding along now, moving quickly into a 40:0 lead. The game is finished off with a good serve to the backhand, which Townsend can only hit into the net. This match looks to be going only one way. Halep wins the first set 6-2. The Romanian is knowing how to push Townsend\u2019s buttons, getting her to move around the court. Halep gets a break point but whacks a backhand into the net to take it to deuce. The advantage goes to Halep after Townsend clips the net, allowing her opponent to whack a powerful forehand past her. The American then sends one very long to gift the win to Halep. Halep leads 5-2. Halep is into her stride and takes her service game to love. Easy peasy. Halep leads 4-2. Halep picks up the first couple of points against the serve but then hits one long to give Townsend a way back in. The Romanian shows her frustration as she knows the game was in that shot. She shows her athleticism to get to the net for the next point and lift a shot beyond Townsend who can only return it wide. Both players hit some fine shots from the baseline until Halep whacks a winner which Townsend has no chance of reaching, resulting in the first break. Halep leads 3-2. Not much fuss in the next game as Halep completes the win to draw level at 2-2. A drop shot from Townsend makes Halep move quickly towards the net where she lifts a shot cross court for the winner. It\u2019s a great shot and merits the point. Townsend has the chance to win the game but then double faults with two very wide serves. She makes up for it by getting the advantage with a fine volley. Halep hits one long and Townsend takes the game. Townsend leads 2-1. A stunning backhand from a Halep second serve gives Townsend break point but she cannot follow it up and hits the next shot into the net. She earns the advantage but once against fails to complete the win. There is no doubting Townsend\u2019s aggression and power in her hitting but she needs to know how to control is, as she once again puts too much on her shot. Halep survives to take the game. 1-1 in the first set. Townsend looks very natural with her hitting and wins the first point thanks to a lovely volley. Halep will be aiming to get the American moving around on the slightly slower than usual courts. Townsend is putting everything into her shots but overhits two on the trot to give Halep a simple lead. The qualifier recovers, however, to take the first game. The players have tossed up and are ready to go on court. Townsend will serve first. Halep is hoping to inspire the whole of Romania, which is nice. Having visited a few times, she is certainly already a big deal in Bucharest. Good evening. Halep will be on court soon, meaning Mrs Liveblogger will be pretty excited by her compatriot being in action and I will have to hand over the Amazon Prime password. I\u2019m off for a bit of food. Here\u2019s Will Unwin for the next half an hour or so ... Zverev, looking remarkably sweat-free a la Federer despite those five sets, speaks: I\u2019ve known Frances since we were 10 years old. Every match we play is getting tougher and tougher. I hope it\u2019ll continue like that and we\u2019ll play even bigger matches in our career. It\u2019s usually what I do in the first few rounds of majors, play five sets. All jokes aside, Frances gave me an unbelievable fight, I had to play five sets. Tiafoe rips off his shirt, has a quick massage, and then holds his serve to love. The 21-year-old American\u2019s looking fairly pumped up as he prepares to receive but, with his opponent serving for the match, the energy isn\u2019t enough to put off Zverev. The only blot in the game for Zverev is a double fault at 30-0, which he cancels out with an ace for 40-15, two match points. Tiafoe\u2019s forehand flies beyond the baseline and Zverev survives his second consecutive five-setter. Of course he\u2019ll be pleased to escape, but he doesn\u2019t make it easy for himself. He came to New York desperately seeking some form, but many question marks remain. The 6ft 6in Zverev is now standing tall on Arthur Ashe, where his 20th ace of the day gets him to 30-0 and two points away from a 5-2 fifth-set lead over Tiafoe. Tiafoe tonks a volley right back at Zverev for 30-15. But a successful Hawk-Eye appeal from Zverev brings up game point. Zverev scoops a volley just on to the baseline and that\u2019s the game. Tiafoe is calling for the trainer, which Zverev doesn\u2019t seem too happy about given the stage of this match. Meanwhile in some results that I missed earlier what with all that\u2019s going on around Flushing Meadows today: there was, erm, much to like about Karolina Muchova\u2019s third-set tie-break victory over Hsieh Su-wei. The Czech will play Serena Williams in the third round. Kristina Mladenovic, the conqueror of Angelique Kerber, has been conquered herself, losing 6-3 in the final set to her fellow Frenchwoman Fiona Ferro, and Denis Kudla has beaten Serbia\u2019s Dusan Lajovic in four sets and will now face the most famous Serbian of them all, Novak Djokovic. Daniil Medvedev, the star of the hard-court summer who has played more matches since Wimbledon than Djokovic, Federer and Nadal combined, is two sets to the good against the Bolivian Hugo Dellien, leading 6-3, 7-5. The fifth seed hasn\u2019t been entirely at ease though: Zverev still has a zip in his step despite conceding that fourth set, and is hustling Tiafoe on the American\u2019s serve at deuce. Tiafoe, under pressure, sends an errant volley wide. It\u2019s Zverev\u2019s advantage. This was the stage when Tiafoe was broken in the two sets he lost. He\u2019ll be desperate to avoid the same fate here. He manages to fend off the break point with the smash, but is soon facing another break point, which he saves with a forehand volley, and a third, which he also resists, but he is powerless to do anything about the fourth when Zverev cracks a backhand down the line. It\u2019s Zverev who has the fifth-set advantage, leading 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 2-6, 2-0. Alex Zverev is going to five sets on Arthur Ashe. But you\u2019d probably already predicted that. He doesn\u2019t seem to be able to do it any other way in the early rounds of slams, and it often means he doesn\u2019t have enough left in the tank. With the shadows almost enveloping the main court, Frances Tiafoe serves out the fourth set 6-2. James Blake, a former quarter-finalist here who is mentoring the young Tiafoe, looks on approvingly in the stands. This could be a tasty finale between the two top talents. Ons Jabeur is one win away from becoming the first Arab woman to break the top 50 after coming from a set down to defeat Aliaksandra Sasnovich of Belarus 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. The Tunisian, who turned 25 yesterday, will have her work cut out to get that landmark victory at this tournament though, because she faces the third seed, Karolina Pliskova, next. Naomi Osaka has also taken care of business, beating Poland\u2019s Magda Linette 6-2, 6-4. Last year\u2019s champion and this year\u2019s Australian Open winner be pleased with that after appearing to be a bundle of nerves in her first-round, three-set win. It means if Coco Gauff beats Timea Babos tonight, it\u2019ll be Osaka v Gauff in round three. Yes please. You wait three days for another British winner, and then two come along at once. Just minutes after Evans\u2019s victory, Konta serves up a second-set bagel in New York for a brutal win over the stunned Russian Margarita Gasparyan in 55 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s never straightforward,\u201d says a modest Konta. \u201cIt was tricky conditions. The match-up worked in my favour but it\u2019s never straightforward. Very happy to have come through. Yesterday was a long day for everyone who didn\u2019t get to play so I\u2019m pleased to make the third round.\u201d The way this match has gone, this game is likely to be anything but straightforward for Evans. But then the 29-year-old likes to defy expectations. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0. Three match points. Pouille\u2019s rasping return saves the first. But the Frenchman lobs long on the second! Evans knocks out the 25th seed after three hours and 10 minutes of fluctuating and sometimes fascinating tennis. Next up for Evans: a certain Mr Federer. Then at 4-4 between Evans and Pouille, Evans has two break points. Will this be the final twist in this match? No, because Pouille saves both, the second with a remarkable forehand winner down the left sideline! Deuce. But then Evans charges straight back at Pouille with the next two points and he\u2019ll serve for the match! Evans is channelling his inner Kyrgios on Court 12, where he receives a warning for an audible obscenity when Pouille moves to break-back point. Pouille pings a perfect winner for 3-3. This match will end after Konta\u2019s at this rate, because Konta is still ripping through the games, leading Gasparyan 6-1, 3-0. As for the score on Louis Armstrong, Osaka briefly forgot she was the world No 1 and defending champion again, sliding 2-0 down in the second set, but she\u2019s now well on track for the third round and a possible blockbuster with Coco Gauff (if the 15-year-old wins in the night session later), leading Magda Linette 6-2, 4-3 with the break. Cripes. I go a get a quick drink and it\u2019s 5-1 Konta. The British No 1 clearly doesn\u2019t want to hang around having had to wait a day to start this match. And she soon has 15-40 on Gasparyan\u2019s serve, two set points. And Gasparyan waves the white flag with a timid double fault! Konta charges through the first set 6-1. She\u2019ll be keen to avoid a let-up in the second, having also whizzed through the opening set in the first round before being extended to three. There\u2019s plenty going on elsewhere too. My head\u2019s hurting trying to figure out where to look on the scoreboard. Frances Tiafoe has taken the second set against Alex Zverev \u2013 when does the sixth seed ever like to do it the easy way? \u2013 but Zverev has the advantage in the third, leading 6-3, 3-6, 4-1. Daniil Medvedev, who has overtaken Zverev in the rankings and appears the best placed of the Next Gen to challenge Djokovic, Nadal and Federer after his red-hot run on the American hard courts over the past few weeks, is 5-2 up on Bolivia\u2019s Hugo Dellien, while Stan Wawrinka, the champion three years ago, leads France\u2019s Jeremy Chardy 6-4, 2-2. Konta, meanwhile, is now under way against Russia\u2019s Margarita Gasparyan, who\u2019s only 24 but has already had three knee surgeries. It\u2019s 1-1 in the opening set. Tom Hiddleston was watching as a guest in Konta\u2019s box during the first round; no sign yet of whether he\u2019s back today. Though Kobe Bryant and Colin Kaepernick are currently in Naomi Osaka\u2019s corner on Louis Armstrong, where the world No1 and defending champion may finally be playing like the world No1 and defending champion. She leads Poland\u2019s Magda Linette by a set to love, 6-2. ... five straight points for the Frenchman and it\u2019s 5-3. Evans reduces his arrears to 5-4 but the breaker is on the racket of Pouille, who has two points on serve to finish it off. And here\u2019s set point number four, to add to the three he had at 5-4. Pouille prevails and Evans, who should really be back in the locker room pondering how he is going to tackle Federer tomorrow, will have to regroup in a fourth set! A perfect start from Evans as he gets not one but two mini-breaks to sprint 3-0 ahead. A couple of points on serve here would give him a stranglehold over Pouille. But nothing in this set has been straightforward, Evans promptly loses both and they\u2019re back on serve. Pouille then wins a quick point, as they change ends at 3-3 ... As one Brit starts, another will be hoping he is about to finish, with Evans edging ahead in this see-sawing third set, 6-5 on serve. He\u2019s putting pressure on Pouille\u2019s serve at 30-all, but Pouille holds firm to close the game out from there. It\u2019s tie-break time! And given the way this set has gone, I don\u2019t think anyone will want to predict what is about to happen. Alex de Minaur is roaring on Court 5, because the young Australian has conquered Chile\u2019s 31st seed, Cristian Garin, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3 to reach the third round for the second consecutive year. Up next: the 2014 finalist Kei Nishikori. De Minaur\u2019s victory means Britain\u2019s Johanna Konta will be in action very shortly. That blast of cool air does the trick, though not immediately. Pouille quickly moves to 40-15, two set points. Evans saves both, the second with a smart return that just clips the line. Deuce becomes Pouille\u2019s advantage, and this time Evans dispatches a winning volley to stay in the set, before managing to bring up his own advantage. Evans is being pegged well behind the baseline by Pouille\u2019s hard hitting but the Frenchman then flaps into the net! Another wild swing in momentum. Having saved three set points, Evans is back on serve at 6-4, 6-3, 5-5. 15-30 turns into 30-40, a break point that could leave Pouille serving for the third set. A rattled Evans surrenders. He should have been 5-2 up, instead he finds himself 5-4 down. Evans, clearly feeling the heat both literally and figuratively, cools himself down with the on-court air-conditioning unit \u2013 a new innovation this year \u2013 at the changeover. At 6-4, 6-3, 4-2, two more holds of serve will elevate Evans into the last 32. He moves to game point and has the whole of the court to aim into with a volley ... but misses! Perhaps he was too busy picturing that meeting with Federer, who he pushed in three tight sets at the Australian Open this year, impressing the GOAT so much that Evans was invited to Dubai to practice with Federer. But that match will have to wait, because Pouille makes the most of the unexpected reprieve to break, before holding for 4-4. And Evans is reeling at 15-30 on his serve ... Two results for you: Petra Martic, the 22nd seed, has beaten Ana Bogdan, who got the better of Britain\u2019s Harriet Dart in round one. The score: 6-2, 6-4. And Qiang Wang, seeded 18th, has bettered Belgium\u2019s Alison Van Uytvanck, 7-5, 6-4. Evans is also charging towards the finish line and that third-round meeting with Federer, because he leads 4-1 in a third set that has lasted a matter of minutes. It\u2019s also a wrap on Grandstand, where Sofia Kenin, one of a group of hugely talented American women coming through (and one of 13 home hopes in action on day four), has recovered from a slow start to produce a quick finish, beating the German Laura Siegemund 7-6 (4), 6-0. A quick turnaround on Louis Armstrong, where Petkovic breaks back, holds and then has Kvitova on the canvas, two match points down at 4-6, 4-5, 15-40. Kvitova comes to the net and seems well in control, but Petkovic keeps on getting it back and Kvitova knocks herself out when she horribly hoiks wide! The world No 6 is out and is the first top-10 seed on the women\u2019s side to exit. It\u2019s a case of from the bad to the even worse for Pouille, who falls 0-15, 0-30, 0-40 down at 3-5. So that\u2019s three set points for Evans. The British No 2 can\u2019t direct his return into play on the first. He just about lands his second return, but it drops so short that it\u2019s an easy put-away for Pouille. Evans\u2019s third effort falls invitingly in the middle of the court for Pouille to bury. Deuce. Evans\u2019s advantage. And Pouille \u2013 who\u2019s hit 26 unforced errors in this second set \u2013 gives it away with a double fault! Evans leads 6-4, 6-3 and has never lost from two sets to love up. It may only be lunchtime in New York, but fans on Arthur Ashe may well be getting out the popcorn and enjoying some beers for what could be a cracking encounter between Alex Zverev and the 21-year-old talent Frances Tiafoe, who gave Federer a five-set fright under the lights here a couple of years ago. Zverev, who is looking to salvage his season after a hugely disappointing 2019, didn\u2019t look too convincing in the first round, when he went the distance against Radu Albot. But he\u2019s zoomed out of the blocks here and already leads by a set to love, 6-3. Goffin clearly likes a bit of symmetry. The 15th seed, a recent finalist in Cincinnati, wraps up that win, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2. Kvitova still has that break in the second set, leading Petkovic 4-3 but trailing in the match overall, having lost the first 6-4. Sofia Kenin, the 20-year-old Moscow-born American who recently broke the top 20, has edged the first set against Laura Siegemund, 7-4 in the tie-break. Another American, Denis Kudla, is 7-5 up on Serbia\u2019s Dusan Lajovic, while David Goffin is serving for the match against Gregoire Barrere, leading 6-2, 6-2, 5-2. That 2016 run was Evans\u2019s last visit to New York, what with the drug ban that followed. It really has been some effort from the 29-year-old to resurrect his career. He was unranked 18 months ago and is now near his best ever ranking, sitting just outside the top 50. With Pouille serving at 1-3, a double fault gifts Evans a chance for the double break. Evans blazes a backhand well wide. Deuce. Another break point. Evans lobs, Pouille produces a tweener ... and then a breathtaking backhand cross-court winner! If the Frenchman doesn\u2019t get inspiration from that, nothing will rouse him into action. Deuce. Game Pouille. It\u2019s Evans 6-4, 3-2. Pouille landed a fairly pitiful percentage of first serves in that first set - 24%. He\u2019s a tremendous talent but is a temperamental one too, and he\u2019s blowing so hot and cold. Evans breaks right at the start of the second set, backs it up for 2-0 and continues to look comfortable at 3-1. Evans has produced some of his best tennis at Flushing Meadows over the years, and had memorable runs to the third round in 2013 and 2016, when he came desperately close to defeating Stan Wawrinka before losing in five sets. The way this is going another third-round appearance beckons. Could he do to Federer what he nearly did to Wawrinka? Goffin is ripping through the sets. The steady Belgian, who is Daveeed Ferrrrrrerrrrr like in his ability to get the most out of his talent, now leads 6-2, 6-2. Kvitova, meanwhile, is in a bit of trouble on Louis Armstrong. The two-times Wimbledon champion, who surprisingly hasn\u2019t been beyond the quarter-finals at the US Open, has lost the first set 6-4 in a competitive, hard-hitting battle against Petkovic. Kvitova has been troubled by an arm injury since withdrawing from the French Open in May, so will have her work cut out to come through this. But she\u2019s showing fight at the start of the second set, and has the break at 2-1. ... Set point number three. And Evans eventually takes the set 6-4 when Pouille\u2019s effort flies well long! Pouille promptly marmalises his racket. However just as Evans was broken straight after breaking early in the set, he\u2019s in danger of conceding serve here. 0-30. Pouille gets a glimmer on a second-serve return but spanks it into the net. Then it\u2019s Evans\u2019s turn to throw in the error. 15-40, two break-back points. Pouille tamely nets on the first. This won\u2019t be a game that\u2019ll live long in the memory. But perhaps it will be for Evans, as he recovers to deuce and then nudges ahead for his first set point. Evans produces a one-two punch, then has the chance to settle the point ... but miscues wide! He could come to regret that when Pouille promptly brings up a third break point, but another messy exchange and it\u2019s deuce. Followed by a second set point. And deuce number four ... Which soon becomes advantage Evans, break point. The Brit is squinting into the sun as he jumps around waiting to receive. Evans chips the backhand return back, and seems to be slightly on the back foot, but the point turns around quickly. Evans sprints towards the net and strikes down the line to settle matters. It\u2019s 5-4 Evans, who will serve for the set. Evans\u2019s break, meanwhile, didn\u2019t last long, with Pouille following up that serving game of errors with a receiving game of excellence, sealing the break with a lob that Evans can\u2019t get back into play. And from two consecutive breaks to four consecutive holds. It\u2019s 4-4 with Pouille serving at deuce. De Minaur gets his act together and wraps up the set 6-3. There\u2019s little giving on Louis Armstrong where Kvitova and Germany\u2019s Andrea Petkovic are locked at 4-4, while Kenin has clawed her way back from 3-0 down to trail 3-2 on serve against another German, Laura Siegemund, and the classy Kristina Mladenovic is surprisingly 5-2 down in the all-French face-off with Fiona Ferro. De Minaur is the closest to getting a set in the bag, leading 5-3 and 40-30 on serve against the Chilean 31st seed, Cristian Garin. But the 20-year-old can\u2019t capitalise on the set point and is pegged back to deuce. And then falls break point down. Oh, Alex! So instead the honour falls to David Goffin, who wraps up the first set 6-2 against France\u2019s Gregoire Barrere. Also among the early starters: the two-times Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, the ascending American Sofia Kenin, the Aussie whippersnapper and scrapper Alex de Minaur, the conqueror of Angelique Kerber, Kristina Mladenovic, and Qiang Wang, one of the best players you may never have heard of. Plus David Goffin, Denis Kudla and Ana Bogdan, who put out Britain\u2019s Harriet Dart on Monday. And there are even more besides. Phew. Evans is closing in on an early break. It\u2019s 15-40 on Pouille\u2019s serve. Evans hasn\u2019t had to work too hard for the break points, it has to be said, with several early errors from his opponent\u2019s racket. Evans rushes forward on the first break point and Pouille pings well long! Evans strikes first to lead 2-1. Evans and Pouille are now under way. After a hold apiece it\u2019s 1-1. So what of Pouille? The stylish Frenchman, seeded 25th here but perhaps even more talented than his ranking suggests, reached his first grand slam semi-final this year at the Australian Open, but he has not quite kicked on from that in the way many expected he would. He\u2019s coached by Amelie Mauresmo, the former Wimbledon champion who of course worked with Andy Murray a few years ago. Meanwhile in other extremely pressing Federer news: Perhaps we should be calling him \u201cDanny\u201d Evans from now on, because that\u2019s what Federer, who awaits the winner of this match, called him yesterday. And if the GOAT has bestowed that name upon him, us mere mortals should surely follow. Dan Evans is weaving and winding his way through the grounds of the USTA Billie Jean National Tennis Center as he and Lucas Pouille make their way to Court 12. The British No 2 is looking fairly relaxed, it has to be said, far more relaxed than he was when he was snarling and sulking his way past Adrian Mannarino in the first round.

One of the coolest men in New York right now though is probably Novak Djokovic, who said after his injury-hit, 6-4, 7-6 (3), 6-1 win over Argentina\u2019s Juan Ignacio Londero last night that he\u2019d like to freeze his left shoulder for the next 48 hours. It was clearly causing him some pain, and it will give Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and the chasing pack behind tennis\u2019s triumvirate (if those young pretenders can get their act together) hope that perhaps the defending champion, who has won four of the past five slams, is beatable. Djokovic\u2019s was among eight singles matches to be completed on the show courts yesterday, with Federer, Serena Williams and Ashleigh Barty also afforded the luxury of a roof. Williams had the toughest time of it, pushed to three sets in an absorbing encounter by an opponent not even half her age, the American grand slam rookie Caty McNally. It certainly won\u2019t be the last we hear of the 17-year-old. Hello and welcome to our coverage of day four of the US Open, where the scene looks less like this\u2026 And more like this \u2026 Which is just as well, given Wednesday\u2019s washout on the roofless courts means there are an extra 23 singles matches to squeeze into today\u2019s second-round schedule. Dan Evans will be among the first of those playing catch-up in just over 20 minutes\u2019 time, as the British No 2 faces the French 25th seed, Lucas Pouille, on Court 12, where the prize (or possible punishment) for victory will be a meeting with Roger Federer. Johanna Konta, Britain\u2019s other singles survivor, having made it on to court for her warm-up yesterday only to be rained on almost immediately, is now second on Court 5 against Russia\u2019s Margarita Gasparyan, so is likely to play at around 1pm local time/6pm BST. Elsewhere the names will be coming thick and fast. Alex Zverev? Check. Simona Halep? Check. Petra Kvitova? Check. Naomi Osaka? Check. Stan Wawrinka, Nick Kyrgios and the on-fire Daniil Medvedev? Check, check and check. And we haven\u2019t even mentioned Rafael Nadal, Coco Gauff, Marin Cilic and Caroline Wozniacki, who play in the night session, or the shooting stars of Bianca Andreescu, Denis Shapovalov and Andrey Rublev, who accounted for Stefanos Tsitsipas in the first round. Play begins at: 11am in New York/4pm BST. Strap yourself in. It\u2019s going to be fast and frantic. And fairly sweaty too, with temperatures forecast to hit 30 degrees.",

The Australian-led Interfet force, ably headed by a later governor general, <a href=\"https://www.gg.gov.au/biography-general-honourable-sir-peter-cosgrove-ak-mc-retd\">Peter Cosgrove</a>, showed East Timor \u2013 in stark contrast to the morally (and otherwise) venal Indonesia military (TNI), with its orchestration of the pro-integration militias in the province \u2013 what a disciplined military force looked like.</p> \n<p>But the truth was that throughout 1999, as tensions steadily rose in East Timor after Indonesia\u2019s president BJ Habibie (effectively a puppet of the military) announced an act of self-determination, Australia had been anxious to avoid any military peacekeeping deployment and eager to appease Jakarta by downplaying formal, though undeniable, links between TNI and the militias.</p> \n<p>A raft of <a href=\"https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/indonesia/2019-08-28/us-sought-preserve-close-ties-indonesian-military-it-terrorized-east-timor-runup-1999-independence\">declassified US cables</a> and other documents released by the US-based Indonesia and East Timor project further illuminates what the subversive (and in my view, correct) analysis of the times has always shown. And that is: our federal government was eager to downplay its real differences with the US throughout 1999 on the need for an early peacekeeping deployment to end the anticipated and eventual violence, yet it also ultimately relied on the threat of American military muscle to get Jakarta to allow the UN-mandated Interfet into East Timor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"64834f86-1c16-44c1-b164-13d3a5ea4819\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a2IvKwDJVjk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Something else the cables make unambiguous: Australian ministers, including Howard and the then foreign minister, Alexander Downer, dismissed suggestions TNI was carefully orchestrating the violence by asserting that only \u201cwild elements\u201d or <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s67863.htm\">\u201crogue elements\u201d</a> were involved, but the US Defence Intelligence Agency was making those connections unambiguous.</p> \n<p>Australia would have seen much of the same intelligence.</p> \n<p>Such were the lengths Australia was going to help Jakarta save face \u2013 to protect its precious bilateral relationship with Indonesia.</p> \n<p>The documents also highlight the realpolitik<em> </em>behind Washington\u2019s attempts to preserve military relations with Indonesia, despite its detailed knowledge of the TNI-orchestrated violence and human rights concerns in Congress.</p> \n<p>\u201cMilitia members in east Timor have had unrestricted access to the Indonesian military arsenal, acquiring small arms and hand grenades as supplements to traditional weapons such as machetes and spears,\u201d reads one assessment of the militias, who killed \u201cthousands\u201d.</p> \n<p>As a Canberra-based foreign affairs and defence correspondent, on 1 August 1999 I reported for the Sunday Age how Australian officials had earlier that year talked down US overtures for an early peacekeeping mission (to avoid the violence that eventually transpired), possibly involving Marines. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e0fe6e60a6e6f599f136d2f0b7b73db451e3cdd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e0fe6e60a6e6f599f136d2f0b7b73db451e3cdd/0_0_1708_1251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"'Snub' article by Paul Daley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"732\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af1d434eab0eb5a09171d7fb636fe3daea642785\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af1d434eab0eb5a09171d7fb636fe3daea642785/0_89_1475_2214/666.jpg\" alt=\"'Snub' article by Paul Daley\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Downer was outraged.

America <em>had</em> raised the prospect of sending 15,000 US troops into East Timor via Darwin.</p> \n<p>Late that evening Downer went into the House of Representatives to admit he had not read the secret Australian cable about the US contingency on troops \u2013 the same cable in which a key \u201carea of difference\u201d in approach between the US and Australia was spelt out.</p> \n<p>Downer had sought, in both Australia and the US, to belittle the first article and to challenge the credibility of its authorship. The lengths he went to are made plain in one of the newly released cables by the Indonesia and East Timor project.</p> \n<p>As pre-ballot tensions were rising in East Timor, <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/423629410/20040747DOS302-3\">US cabling on 2 August 1999</a> makes it clear that a priority in Canberra for the Australian foreign minister was managing the embarrassment of any suggestion of a US-Australia rift on peacekeeping or anything else.</p> \n<p>A department of Foreign Affairs and Trade deputy secretary, Neil Mules, told the US embassy in Canberra that the articles \u201cinfuriated FM Downer\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f227a1445de991a7331af4919ebaf4f3d77e884\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f227a1445de991a7331af4919ebaf4f3d77e884/0_0_796_241/500.png\" alt=\"ragout of a cable\" width=\"500\" height=\"151\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cDowner strongly denied their veracity in an August 1 television interview [the day the Sunday Age published the most contentious article] and ordered DFAT to send to the Australian Embassy in Washington for transmission to the Department press points he is using to rebut the articles ... Mules urged that, in responding to press queries about these stories, USG [United States Government] spokesmen make similar points.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>International PR while the militias prepared to torch Dili!</p> \n<p>In his 2004 book, <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/15123259\">Reluctant Saviour</a>, Clinton Fernandes, a historian and former Australian military intelligence officer who was intimate with the East Timor military operation, wrote: \u201cThe problem was that for the whole of 1999, the government had lobbied to keep peacekeepers <em>out</em> [of East Timor]. It now [by August 1999] worked frantically to allow international forces to enter East Timor in order to prevent a political crisis in Australia. Contrary to Howard and Downer\u2019s earlier claims, repeated even today when asked why peacekeepers weren\u2019t sent in before the ballot, four days of diplomatic pressure is all it took for Indonesia to agree to foreign troops.\u201d </p> \n<p>The critically effective \u201cdiplomatic\u201d pressure (which I read, in the light of these now released cables, to be more tantamount to implied US military threat) comes not from Australia, however, but from the US military establishment.</p> \n<p>The newly released cables make apparent how the US State Department, always carefully managing Washington\u2019s bilateral relations with Jakarta, played a secondary role to US Defense in the critical days before Habibie agreed to allow Interfet into East Timor.</p> \n<p>While the then Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas, echoing other similarly threatening voices in the Jakarta administration, warned that \u201cnations willing to send peacekeepers to the province would have to shoot their way in\u201d, the US military establishment was figuratively reading the riot act to Indonesian military chief Wiranto.</p> \n<p>East Timor descended into extreme violence after the 4 September 1999 ballot result, which overwhelmingly favoured independence. The Indonesian military, responsible for security, declared martial law on 6 September, while also aiding the militias. The international community was outraged but needed Indonesian permission before a UN-sanctioned force would be allowed in.</p> \n<p>The military controlled Habibie. So, plainly, the Indonesian military had to be convinced \u2013 perhaps in the only way it understood, with the implied threat of heavy consequence \u2013 to capitulate.</p> \n<p>On 8 September the commander of US forces in the Pacific, Dennis Blair, met Wiranto.</p> \n<p>He told Wiranto if East Timor\u2019s security continued to deteriorate \u201cit will do potentially irrevocable damage to Indonesia\u2019s relationship with the rest of the world, including the US\u201d. According to the US cable recording the meeting, Blair left his talking points with Wiranto.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/30/infuriated-alexander-downer-tried-to-get-us-officials-to-back-up-response-to-east-timor-leaks\">'Infuriated' Alexander Downer tried to get US officials to mask Australian inaction on East Timor</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Point five reads: \u201cThe whole world is watching as this tragedy unfolds, and international condemnation of Indonesia has grown to a fever pitch.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s precise role in bringing independence to Timor-Leste two decades ago continues to simmer as unsettled business at the heart of modern Australian diplomatic and military history. Twenty years is the blink of an eye, of course. And my memories of having a front-row seat on the Australian domestic politics, and the diplomatic and military movements preceding and following the East Timorese autonomy ballot, are vivid. John Howard later pointed to two key moments of his prime ministership about which he is most proud: his government\u2019s response to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre and Australia\u2019s part in East Timor. After the violence diminished, and as the fledgling nation began to govern itself (and even as our spies bugged Dili\u2019s cabinet room to gain unfair advantage in minerals negotiations) Australia has cast itself as the hero of East Timor. The Australian-led Interfet force, ably headed by a later governor general, Peter Cosgrove, showed East Timor \u2013 in stark contrast to the morally (and otherwise) venal Indonesia military (TNI), with its orchestration of the pro-integration militias in the province \u2013 what a disciplined military force looked like. But the truth was that throughout 1999, as tensions steadily rose in East Timor after Indonesia\u2019s president BJ Habibie (effectively a puppet of the military) announced an act of self-determination, Australia had been anxious to avoid any military peacekeeping deployment and eager to appease Jakarta by downplaying formal, though undeniable, links between TNI and the militias. A raft of declassified US cables and other documents released by the US-based Indonesia and East Timor project further illuminates what the subversive (and in my view, correct) analysis of the times has always shown. And that is: our federal government was eager to downplay its real differences with the US throughout 1999 on the need for an early peacekeeping deployment to end the anticipated and eventual violence, yet it also ultimately relied on the threat of American military muscle to get Jakarta to allow the UN-mandated Interfet into East Timor. Something else the cables make unambiguous: Australian ministers, including Howard and the then foreign minister, Alexander Downer, dismissed suggestions TNI was carefully orchestrating the violence by asserting that only \u201cwild elements\u201d or \u201crogue elements\u201d were involved, but the US Defence Intelligence Agency was making those connections unambiguous. Australia would have seen much of the same intelligence. Such were the lengths Australia was going to help Jakarta save face \u2013 to protect its precious bilateral relationship with Indonesia. The documents also highlight the realpolitik behind Washington\u2019s attempts to preserve military relations with Indonesia, despite its detailed knowledge of the TNI-orchestrated violence and human rights concerns in Congress. \u201cMilitia members in east Timor have had unrestricted access to the Indonesian military arsenal, acquiring small arms and hand grenades as supplements to traditional weapons such as machetes and spears,\u201d reads one assessment of the militias, who killed \u201cthousands\u201d. As a Canberra-based foreign affairs and defence correspondent, on 1 August 1999 I reported for the Sunday Age how Australian officials had earlier that year talked down US overtures for an early peacekeeping mission (to avoid the violence that eventually transpired), possibly involving Marines. Downer was outraged. He issued multiple denials about the US discussion of a Marine deployment or of any difference in approach between Australia and Washington. Nine days later I published in the Age the secret Australian cable detailing the meeting between Australian and US officials in which stark differences of potential approach and strategy were highlighted. America had raised the prospect of sending 15,000 US troops into East Timor via Darwin. Late that evening Downer went into the House of Representatives to admit he had not read the secret Australian cable about the US contingency on troops \u2013 the same cable in which a key \u201carea of difference\u201d in approach between the US and Australia was spelt out. Downer had sought, in both Australia and the US, to belittle the first article and to challenge the credibility of its authorship. The lengths he went to are made plain in one of the newly released cables by the Indonesia and East Timor project. As pre-ballot tensions were rising in East Timor, US cabling on 2 August 1999 makes it clear that a priority in Canberra for the Australian foreign minister was managing the embarrassment of any suggestion of a US-Australia rift on peacekeeping or anything else. A department of Foreign Affairs and Trade deputy secretary, Neil Mules, told the US embassy in Canberra that the articles \u201cinfuriated FM Downer\u201d. \u201cDowner strongly denied their veracity in an August 1 television interview [the day the Sunday Age published the most contentious article] and ordered DFAT to send to the Australian Embassy in Washington for transmission to the Department press points he is using to rebut the articles ... Mules urged that, in responding to press queries about these stories, USG [United States Government] spokesmen make similar points.\u201d International PR while the militias prepared to torch Dili! In his 2004 book, Reluctant Saviour, Clinton Fernandes, a historian and former Australian military intelligence officer who was intimate with the East Timor military operation, wrote: \u201cThe problem was that for the whole of 1999, the government had lobbied to keep peacekeepers out [of East Timor]. It now [by August 1999] worked frantically to allow international forces to enter East Timor in order to prevent a political crisis in Australia. Contrary to Howard and Downer\u2019s earlier claims, repeated even today when asked why peacekeepers weren\u2019t sent in before the ballot, four days of diplomatic pressure is all it took for Indonesia to agree to foreign troops.\u201d The critically effective \u201cdiplomatic\u201d pressure (which I read, in the light of these now released cables, to be more tantamount to implied US military threat) comes not from Australia, however, but from the US military establishment. The newly released cables make apparent how the US State Department, always carefully managing Washington\u2019s bilateral relations with Jakarta, played a secondary role to US Defense in the critical days before Habibie agreed to allow Interfet into East Timor. While the then Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas, echoing other similarly threatening voices in the Jakarta administration, warned that \u201cnations willing to send peacekeepers to the province would have to shoot their way in\u201d, the US military establishment was figuratively reading the riot act to Indonesian military chief Wiranto. East Timor descended into extreme violence after the 4 September 1999 ballot result, which overwhelmingly favoured independence. The Indonesian military, responsible for security, declared martial law on 6 September, while also aiding the militias. The international community was outraged but needed Indonesian permission before a UN-sanctioned force would be allowed in. The military controlled Habibie. So, plainly, the Indonesian military had to be convinced \u2013 perhaps in the only way it understood, with the implied threat of heavy consequence \u2013 to capitulate. On 8 September the commander of US forces in the Pacific, Dennis Blair, met Wiranto. He told Wiranto if East Timor\u2019s security continued to deteriorate \u201cit will do potentially irrevocable damage to Indonesia\u2019s relationship with the rest of the world, including the US\u201d. According to the US cable recording the meeting, Blair left his talking points with Wiranto. Point five reads: \u201cThe whole world is watching as this tragedy unfolds, and international condemnation of Indonesia has grown to a fever pitch. The window of opportunity in which Indonesia can salvage its relations with the world is rapidly shutting ... I appeal to you to let the international community help Indonesia help itself.\u201d The biggest military gorilla in the South Pacific had beaten its chest. On 12 September Habibie, after a cabinet meeting including Wiranto, announced that Indonesia would accept peacekeepers. Interfet deployed eight days later. The release of these US cables sheds more light on Australia\u2019s true, not always heroic, part in the liberation of East Timor. Just as they will fuel more argument about the history of that combative political, diplomatic, military \u2013 and journalistic \u2013 time. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist",

At a White House ceremony six years after Biden\u2019s visit, White stood at attention as President Barack Obama placed a Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for valor, around his neck.\u201d Campaigning in South Carolina on Thursday, Biden did not offer an apology or admit error. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about, but the central point is it was absolutely accurate what I said,\u201d he told the Charleston Post and Courier. \u201cHe refused the medal. I put it on him, he said, \u2018Don\u2019t do that to me, sir. He died. He died.\u2019 \u201d The candidate denied \u201cthat there\u2019s anything I said about that that wasn\u2019t the essence of the story. The story was that he refused the medal because the fella he tried to save \u2013 and risked his life saving \u2013 died. That\u2019s the beginning, middle and end. The rest of you guys can take it and do what you want with it.\u201d Biden, 76, is a self-confessed \u201cgaffe machine\u201d with a long career of blunders, including during two previous failed presidential campaigns. Some commentators argue this again makes him vulnerable against Democratic challengers for 2020. David Axelrod, the former Barack Obama campaign strategist, tweeted on Thursday: \u201cNot in any way taking anything away from the reporters, who undoubtedly reported it out, but this reads like the product of a pretty sophisticated opposition research dump \u2026 And there will be more, because @JoeBiden is a gaffe and embellishment machine. But if you read to the end of this story, it also reflects something that is a real strength, and that is his empathy.\u201d",

Not a joke.\u2019</p> <p>The Navy captain, Biden recalled Friday night, had rappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body of an American comrade, carrying him on his back. Now the general wanted Biden to pin a Silver Star on the American hero who, despite his bravery, felt like a failure.</p> <p>\u2018He said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!\u2019 \u2019 Biden said, his jaw clenched and his voice rising to a shout. \u2018 \u2018Do not pin it on me, Sir!

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s what\u2019s passed today: Trump urged Americans to \u201cbe aware and be safe\u201d as Hurricane Dorian approaches. The president canceled his planned trip to Poland this weekend as the storm gained force. Both Florida and Georgia have declared states of emergency. The latest computer modeling of Dorian\u2019s path shows that it could arrive as category 3 hurricane or even as a powerful category 4 storm on Florida\u2019s east coast early on Monday. Joe Biden has pushed back against a Washington Post report that he has repeatedly told a false war story on the campaign trail, conflating elements of multiple events into one stirring anecdote. The Democratic presidential candidate asserted that \u201cthe central point is it was absolutely accurate what I said\u201d. The Trump administration is rolling back requirements that oil and gas drillers correct leaks of methane. The administration has also drafted a proposal to subject undocumented immigrants in government custody to DNA testing. ABC released the details of the next Democratic debate, which will take place on a single night in Houston. The 12 September event will mark the first time that all qualifying candidates share the same stage. The president and the White House released scathing statements about James Comey after the DOJ inspector general concluded that the former FBI director violated DOJ and FBI policies by sharing memos on his interactions with Trump. But the watchdog also concluded Comey had not leaked classified information to the media, as Trump has repeatedly claimed. In response to a letter from the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University urging Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez not to block Twitter followers, the New York representative responded that she only blocked users for ongoing harassment. The Knight First Amendment Institute, which led the legal fight against Donald Trump for blocking his critics on Twitter, held that blocking social media users because of their viewpoints \u201cis unconstitutional, and we are writing in the hope of dissuading you from engaging init.\u201d Multiple US courts have ruled that government social media accounts are constitutionally-protected public spaces. At least three people have sued Ocasio-Cortez for blocking them. The institute does note in its letter that Ocasio-Cortez may \u201cwish to block users for reasons that are both reasonable and constitutionally legitimate\u2014for example, because their speech is threatening,\u201d and offered to work with her to develop a social media policy. Donald Trump has released a video message urging those in the path of Hurricane Dorian to \u201cBe aware and be safe.\u201d \u201cIt looked like it was going to be a very small storm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were very lucky, it missed Puerto Rico.\u201d As the storm heads toward Florida, the president said, \u201cWe have the best people in the world ready... We\u2019re shipping food, we\u2019re shipping water.\u201d The storm left less damage than expected in its wake as it passed Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The latest computer modeling of Dorian\u2019s path now shows that it could arrive as category 3 hurricane or even as a powerful category 4 storm on Florida\u2019s east coast early on Monday. Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very big.\u201d Both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are campaigning in South Carolina this evening. A federal judge rejected House Democrats\u2019 effort to expedite their lawsuit to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns. \u201cIt may be appropriate to expedite this matter at some point, but not now,\u201d said Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump-appointed federal judge in DC. The order is a minor setback for democrats in Congress, who have several court cases regarding the president\u2019s financial information ongoing. The order doesn\u2019t the lawsuit by congressional Ways and Means Committee, which sued in July to enforce its subpoena of the Treasury Department and IRS to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns. Donald Trump\u2019s south Florida resort Mar-a-Lago is threatened as Hurricane Dorian approaches. The beachfront property, which Trump visits frequently and refers to as his \u2018Winter White House,\u2019 is 115 miles south of where the storm is expected to make landfall, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Previous hurricane models predicted that the storm could pass directly through the resort, but as of this morning, it appeared that the storm is shifting north. Trump has been continuously tweeting his monitoring of the storm. At first, he complained about \u201cyet another big storm\u201d as it appeared to head toward Puerto Rico. Today, as the Hurricane moved toward Florida, Trump announced he is canceling his trip to Poland. Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia has declared a state of emergency in parts of Georgia in anticipation of Hurricane Dorian. Florida\u2019s governor Ron DeSantis extended his state of emergency declaration today to include the whole state. Dorian is expected to strengthen into a Category 4 storm as it barrels toward the US mainland. It is expected to make landfall somewhere between the Florida Keys and southern Georgia, though its exact trajectory is still unclear. A federal grand jury has indicted Paige Thompson, a former Amazon software engineer who was arrested last month on charges that she hacked into Calital One and more than 30 other companies. Thompson faces charges of wire fraud, computer fraud and abuse. The data breach affected about 100 million people in the US, and 6 million in Canada. The hacker gained access to information including credit scores and social security numbers of about 140,000 customers. More background from the AP: Between March and July of this year, Thompson created scanning software that allowed her to identify customers of a cloud computing company that had misconfigured their firewalls, allowing someone to access their servers, according to the indictment. Once she had access, Thompson stole data and used the computer power to \u201cmine\u201d cryptocurrency for her own benefit, a practice known as \u201ccryptojacking,\u201d the indictment said. Alabama governor Kay Ivey apologized for participating in a racist skit that involved blackface while she was a college student in the 1960s. From Politico: In a statement Thursday afternoon, Ivey, a Republican, said she was made aware of a taped interview that she and her then-fiance, Ben LaRavia, gave to an Auburn University student radio station when she was a student there. She said she did not remember the specifics of the skit. \u201cEven after listening to the tape, I sincerely do not recall either the skit, which evidently occurred at a Baptist Student Union party, or the interview itself, both which occurred 52-years ago,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cEven though Ben is the one on tape remembering the skit \u2014 and I still don\u2019t recall ever dressing up in overalls or in blackface \u2014 I will not deny what is the obvious.\u201d In May, Ivey gained national attention for signing into the most restrictive abortion law in the country, banning all abortions, including in cases of rape and incest, except when the mother\u2019s life was at risk. The law is currently caught up in a legal battle, and three clinics in Alabama still offering abortion services. Earlier this year, Ralph Northam, the democratic governor of Virginia admitted to wearing blackface after a photo from his medical school yearbook surfaced. The Surgeon General has issued a national warning against marijuana use by adolescents and pregnant women, as more states legalize it. \u201cThis is a dangerous drug,\u201d said Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, in a press conference today. While state laws have changed, Azar emphasized that federal laws have not. Marijuana is legal in some way \u2014 wither for recreational or medical use \u2014 in 33 states. The advisory warns: \u201cMarijuana has changed over time. The marijuana available today is much stronger than previous versions.\u201d From the AP: Officials said President Donald Trump has donated $100,000 \u2014 one-quarter of his annual government salary \u2014 toward a digital campaign to raise awareness of the risks. Trump has forgone his official salary since taking office. ... The American Medical Association said it strongly supports the government\u2019s effort, adding that it for some time it has been recommending against marijuana use by teens, pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding. The surgeon general said his advisory is a direct result of scientific research that runs counter to changing social mores. \u201cMarijuana use is a risk to the developing brain,\u201d Adams said. \u201cOver time there has been a change in attitudes about marijuana creating a false sense of security.\u201d While the White House has made the opioid epidemic a top policy and political priority, marijuana previously had not gotten such high-level attention. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will cover the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump canceled his planned trip to Poland this weekend as meteorologists warned that Hurricane Dorian may soon strike Florida as a Category 4 storm, unleashing potentially catastrophic damage. Joe Biden has pushed back against a Washington Post report that he has repeatedly told a false war story on the campaign trail, conflating elements of multiple events into one stirring anecdote. The Democratic presidential candidate asserted that \u201cthe central point is it was absolutely accurate what I said\u201d. The Trump administration has drafted a proposal to subject undocumented immigrants in government custody to DNA testing. ABC released the details of the next Democratic debate, which will take place on a single night in Houston. The 12 September event will mark the first time that all qualifying candidates share the same stage. With the exception of the senator Kirsten Gillibrand, none of the Democratic presidential candidates who missed the debate stage have shown any indication of ending their campaigns. The president and the White House released scathing statements about James Comey after the DOJ inspector general concluded that the former FBI director violated DOJ and FBI policies by sharing memos on his interactions with Trump. But the watchdog also concluded Comey had not leaked classified information to the media, as Trump has repeatedly claimed. Maanvi will have more coverage on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Trump unveiled the new logo for the US Space Command during a Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate its establishment. The president said the newly established Space Command would help the United States confront the next war-fighting domain and vowed that it would be followed by his promised Space Force. But it\u2019s worth noting that the Space Command is separate from a potential Space Force, which Trump has proposed as a separate branch of the military. Such a move would require congressional approval, a steep hurdle with a Democratic-controlled House. Trump announced his decision to skip the Poland trip during a Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate the establishment of the US Space Command. \u201cIt\u2019s something very important for me to be here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe storm looks like it could be a very big one indeed.\u201d The vice president will travel to Poland in Trump\u2019s place as the country commemorates the 80th anniversary of its Nazi invasion. Trump has canceled a planned trip to Poland this weekend as meteorologists warned that Hurricane Dorian may hit Florida as a Category 4 storm. According to the National Hurricane Center, a Category 4 hurricane is capable of unleashing \u201ccatastrophic damage.\u201d Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has already declared a state of emergency. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the path of this storm -- anywhere on the east coast of Florida -- make your preparations,\u201d DeSantis said at a press conference earlier today. \u201cTake action.\u201d The Trump administration has drafted a policy that would allow Customs and Border Protection officials to perform DNA testing on undocumented immigrants in government custody. BuzzFeed News reports: The move will likely inspire the anger of civil liberties and immigrant advocates, who argue that the government should not draw sensitive personal information from people without being tied to a specific crime. Administration officials estimate that CBP officials would spend more than 20,000 additional work hours on such a policy in its first year of implementation. Hundreds of thousands of individuals could be tested each year if the draft regulation, proposed by the Department of Justice, is fully implemented. While the regulation does not specifically say Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials would also test people in their custody, it also does not limit them from doing so. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, a DHS official said \u2018DHS is working closely with the Department of Justice on a path forward for DNA collection.\u2019 The official noted an ICE pilot program at the southwest border earlier this year, in which the agency took voluntary DNA tests of those they suspected of fraudulently claiming to be families. Joe Biden is pushing back against the Washington Post\u2019s report that a war story the former vice-president has told on the campaign trail contains many falsehoods. The Post reported that the presidential candidate had conflated elements of multiple events in his story about a Navy captain rejecting a Silver Star for retrieving the body of a dead comrade. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about, but the central point is it was absolutely accurate what I said,\u201d Biden told the Charleston Post and Courier. \u201cHe refused the medal. I put it on him, he said, \u2018Don\u2019t do that to me, sir. He died. He died.\u2019 \u201d Biden, who is campaigning in South Carolina today, went on to deny \u201cthat there\u2019s anything I said about that that wasn\u2019t the essence of the story.\u201d \u201cThe story was that he refused the medal because the fella he tried to save \u2014and risked his life saving \u2014 died,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s the beginning, middle and end. The rest of you guys can take it and do what you want with it.\u201d ABC has released the podium order for the next Democratic debate, which will be held on Sept. 12 in Houston. Given that the debate is only one night, this will mark the first time that all qualifying candidates will share the same stage. Joe Biden will appear at center stage, with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders next to him. The next top-polling candidates, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg, will stand next to Warren and Sanders. Interestingly, entrepreneur Andrew Yang will be closer to center stage than other more \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates like Amy Klobuchar and Beto O\u2019Rourke. Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer has released nine years of tax returns, which run 2,683 pages and show the billionaire activist has paid more then $400 million in taxes since 2009. \u201cThis disclosure is unprecedented, compared with many previous candidates\u2019 time in the private sector,\u201d Steyer\u2019s campaign said in a statement accompanying the release. \u201cTom believes it is important to provide voters with an understanding of his role in the private sector, which he has since left behind to work for the public good.\u201d The returns also detail Steyer\u2019s political and charitable contributions, which range in annual totals from $52,500 to nearly $140 million. The White House condemned Jim Comey after the release of the DOJ inspector general\u2019s report about the former FBI director sharing memos on his interactions with Trump. \u201cJames Comey is a proven liar and leaker. The Inspector General\u2019s report shows Comey violated the most basic obligations of confidentiality that he owed to the United States Government and to the American people, \u2018in order to achieve a personally desired outcome,\u2019\u201d the White House\u2019s statement reads. It goes on: \u201cBecause Comey shamefully leaked information to the press\u2014in blatant violation of FBI policies\u2014the Nation was forced to endure the baseless politically motivated, two-year witch hunt. Comey disgraced himself and his office to further a personal political agenda, and this report further confirms that fact.\u201d But the report actually said the inspector general \u201cfound no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to members of the media.\u201d Investigators did conclude, however, that Comey had violated DOJ and FBI policies by sharing the memos. During his Fox News Radio interview, Trump continued to gripe about the network\u2019s coverage of him. The president told Brian Kilmeade that he is \u201cnot happy with Fox.\u201d \u201cPeople think Fox is for me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLook, Sean [Hannity], and Laura [Ingraham] and Tucker [Carlson] has really been very good \u2014 well, Tucker\u2019s a little tricky, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet yesterday that Fox \u201cisn\u2019t working for us anymore,\u201d prompting some of the network\u2019s analysts to push back against the president. Trump\u2019s ire seems to stem from the attention Fox has given to the Democratic presidential primary and the network\u2019s polls showing him losing to the race\u2019s front-runners in hypothetical match-ups. But the president still reserved more anger for CNN, telling Kilmeade that doing an interview with the network would be \u201cdisloyal to my followers.\u201d Trump said in an interview with Fox News radio that US negotiators are \u201cgetting close\u201d to an agreement on withdrawing thousands of troops from Afghanistan, but he did not elaborate on any timeline for the move. \u201cWho knows if it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump told \u201cThe Brian Kilmeade Show.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re going down to 8,600 (troops) and then we\u2019ll make a determination from there.\u201d But Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cautioned just a day earlier that it was too early to talk about a full troop withdrawal. \u201cI\u2019m not using the withdraw word right now,\u201d Dunford said during a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s our judgment that the Afghans need support to deal with the level of violence\u201d in the country. Trump has reportedly been anxious to withdraw the 14,000 US troops remaining in the country, but even some of the president\u2019s allies have warned that such a move could give too much power to the Taliban. One of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, senator Lindsey Graham, echoed the president\u2019s claims that the inspector general report was a remarkable rebuke of Jim Comey. Representative Jim Jordan, another congressional ally of Trump\u2019s, said the report\u2019s findings showed Comey considered himself above the law. But Comey had a much different reading of the report, arguing that he was owed an apology by those who had accused him of leaking classified information. In very predictable fashion, Trump has weighed in on the DOJ inspector general\u2019s report about Jim Comey, saying the former FBI director was \u201cthoroughly disgraced and excoriated.\u201d But the inspector general did not conclude that Comey had leaked classified information, as Trump has repeatedly claimed. The office said in its report that it \u201cfound no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to members of the media.\u201d Investigators did conclude, however, that Comey had violated DOJ and FBI policies by sharing memos detailing his interactions with Trump. A judge has formally ended the criminal case against financier Jeffrey Epstein. US district judge Richard Berman today granted prosecutors\u2019 request to dismiss charges against Epstein after he killed himself in jail in New York on August 10 while he was awaiting his sex trafficking trial, the Associated Press writes. The judge\u2019s action had been expected after the disgraced financier\u2019s death. The announcement minutes ago came after an unusual hearing Berman held on Tuesday where sixteen women detailed how Epstein abused them. The women said he used his financial power and connections to famous people, ranging from politicians to media and business luminaries, to make them vulnerable to sexual attacks that sometimes went on for years. The allegations mirrored the criminal charges in which prosecutors said Epstein repeatedly assaulted women and teenage girls in the early 2000s. Attorney General William Barr has promised the Justice Department will continue to pursue those who enabled Epstein to carry out sex attacks. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has repeatedly told a story on the campaign trail about the bravery of a Navy captain he met while serving as vice president. But it appears that many of the story\u2019s details are false. The Washington Post reports: Joe Biden painted a vivid scene for the 400 people packed into a college meeting hall. A four-star general had asked the then-vice president to travel to Kunar province in Afghanistan, a dangerous foray into \u2018godforsaken country\u2019 to recognize the remarkable heroism of a Navy captain. Some told him it was too risky, but Biden said he brushed off their concerns. \u2018We can lose a vice president,\u2019 he said. \u2018We can\u2019t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke.\u2019 The Navy captain, Biden recalled Friday night, had rappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body of an American comrade, carrying him on his back. Now the general wanted Biden to pin a Silver Star on the American hero who, despite his bravery, felt like a failure. \u2018He said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!\u2019 \u2019 Biden said, his jaw clenched and his voice rising to a shout. \u2018 \u2018Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!\u2019 \u2018 The room was silent. \u2018This is the God\u2019s truth,\u2019 Biden had said as he told the story. \u2018My word as a Biden.\u2019 Except almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect. Based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. troops, their commanders and Biden campaign officials, it appears as though the former vice president has jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery, compassion and regret that never happened. ABC, who is hosting the next Democratic debate, confirmed that the event will occur on a single night, Sept. 12, in Houston. The network also confirmed the ten candidates who have qualified for the debate: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. The debate will mark the first time Biden and Warren have met onstage as the pair, along with Sanders, have consistently out-polled their competitors. ABC will air the debate from 8 to 11 p.m. E.T. on Sept. 12 from Texas Southern University, and four of the network\u2019s hosts (George Stephanopoulos, David Muir, Linsey Davis and Jorge Ramos) will moderate. The podium order will be announced later today. ABC also clarified that candidates will be allowed to make opening statements but not closing statements. Each candidate will have one minute and 15 seconds for direct responses to questions and 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals. Trump is gloating after MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell retracted a thinly sourced story about the president\u2019s finances. O\u2019Donnell reported on his show Tuesday night that a single source had told him some of Trump\u2019s loans from Deutsche Bank had Russian co-signers. The host acknowledged during his show last night that the story did not meet NBC\u2019s reporting standards. \u201cTonight, we are retracting the story,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether the information is inaccurate, but the fact is we do know it wasn\u2019t ready for broadcast, and for that I apologize.\u201d Trump then took to Twitter to make the baseless argument that the incident was reflective of a wider \u201cFake News\u201d problem. Of course, O\u2019Donnell\u2019s retraction reflects journalists\u2019 willingness to acknowledge when they have gotten their facts wrong. Trump has almost never acknowledged getting his facts wrong, even though he very frequently does. Darrell Issa, a former Republican congressman from California, has formed an exploratory committee as he weighs a potential return to Capitol Hill. \u201cI have formally launched an exploratory committee for the 50th Congressional District in California,\u201d Issa wrote on a new website. The 50th District is currently represented by Duncan Hunter, who has been accused of misusing campaign funds to facilitate extramarital affairs. \u201cI have received such a tremendous outpouring of encouragement from supporters inside the district, and around the state and across the Nation,\u201d Issa said. \u201cI\u2019m truly grateful for the many encouraging phone calls, messages and letters that I have received.\u201d Issa retired from Congress last year after narrowly winning re-election in 2016. His website touts his past work as a chairman of the House oversight committee, but several sections of the site were marked with \u201cplaceholder\u201d titles, which might not inspire confidence in California voters. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Jim Comey, the former FBI director, violated DOJ and FBI policies by sharing memos detailing his interactions with Trump, according to the DOJ\u2019s inspector general. But the watchdog found no evidence Comey released classified information to the media. Trump\u2019s former defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has sidestepped questions about the president\u2019s fitness to serve. Mattis, who is starting a book tour to promote \u201cCall Sign Chaos,\u201d told the Atlantic that he felt he owed the administration some silence. The third Democratic debate will be a one-night event after only 10 candidates managed to qualify. Despite spending $16 million to make the cut, billionaire activist Tom Steyer fell one poll short of qualification. Trump will participate in a ceremony this afternoon for the establishment of the US Space Command, so stay tuned. Even though she did not make the cut for the third debate, Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard ruled out the possibility of running as an independent candidate if she fails to win the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cI will not,\u201d the Hawaii congresswoman told CNN when asked about the possibility. \u201cNo, I have ruled that out.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to focus on moving our campaign forward, continuing this grassroots campaign, continuing to deliver our message to the American people and ask for their support.\u201d Gabbard still has a chance to appear in the fourth debate, given that she has already met the donor requirement and has more time to get two additional qualifying polls. But Gabbard appeared to minimize the importance of debates while speaking to CNN, saying they are \u201cnot the only way to be able to talk to voters and to be able to spend time with them.\u201d Most of the Democratic presidential candidates who did not make the cut for the next debate are showing no signs of giving up the fight. Despite having one qualifying poll, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand dropped out of the race yesterday after acknowledging she would not be able to participate in the September debate. And yet John Delaney, who has very little to show for the millions he has spent on his presidential campaign, is continuing with his bid. Marianne Williamson and Tulsi Gabbard, who have met the DNC\u2019s donor requirement but have not yet crossed its polling threshold, also appeared committed to staying in the race. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden sharply condemned the Trump administration\u2019s latest immigration policy move. Reports emerged yesterday that the administration has been denying requests from non-citizens to remain in the country to receive medical attention for severe health problems. \u201cWe are running out of words to condemn the inhumanity of this administration,\u201d Biden said in a statement. Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, said the DOJ watchdog\u2019s report on Comey underscored the need to investigate the origins of the Russia probe. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to Inspector General Horowitz for his characteristically thorough and professional work. This report confirms that James Comey violated the FBI\u2019s own standards of conduct and was dishonest about how he handled classified material,\u201d Collins said in a statement. He went on: \u201cThis further cements the need for us to get to the root of how the Russia investigation began. It\u2019s time to restore Americans\u2019 confidence that federal law enforcement is committed to justice and free from political gamesmanship.\u201d The DOJ inspector general is also expected to soon release its report on the origins of the Russia investigation, which Republicans have claimed was tainted by anti-Trump bias. CNN reports: CNN reported last month that federal investigators in Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s office had conducted more than 100 interviews as part of the review. Its release is not expected until September at the earliest ... Allies of the President, including GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have predicted that the FISA report would be \u2018ugly and damning.\u2019 Last week, Graham vowed to bring Horowitz before his committee to publicly testify on the investigation, which the President has nicknamed \u2018Spygate.\u2019 Comey has weighed in on the release of the DOJ inspector general\u2019s report, arguing that those who have accused him of leaking classified information owe him a apology. Comey specifically called out Trump for repeatedly denouncing the former FBI director as a \u201cleaker.\u201d Although the report concludes Comey did violate DOJ and FBI policies by sharing his memos detailing interactions with Trump, it notes that DOJ officials declined to pursue prosecution against Comey. Comey\u2019s memos detailed several interactions he had with Trump that raised alarms among Democratic lawmakers. For example, the former FBI director alleged the president expressed hope in a private meeting that Comey would \u201clet go\u201d of an investigation into Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. Comey said Trump also demanded that he express loyalty to him, a claim that the president has flatly denied. \u201cI hardly know the man,\u201d Trump said in 2017. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say: \u2018I want you to pledge allegiance.\u2019 Who would do that?\u201d Comey has repeatedly dismissed claims that he leaked classified information as a political talking point. The president himself as been one of the most ardent supporters of this attack line against the former FBI director. \u201cTo be clear, this was not a \u2018leak\u2019 of classified information no matter how many times politicians, political pundits, or the president call it that,\u201d Comey wrote in his 2018 memoir. \u201cA private citizen may legally share unclassified details of a conversation with the president with the press, or include that information in a book.\u201d But the DOJ inspector general concluded Comey\u2019s actions did indeed violate the department\u2019s policies. The inspector general\u2019s report centers on a series of memos Comey wrote detailing his personal interactions with Trump and whether the release of some of those memos exposed classified information. The contents of the memos, some of which Comey shared with a friend who in turn provided them to the New York Times, helped launch special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The president has repeatedly accused Comey of being a \u201cleaker\u201d for sharing the memos, but the Justice Department declined to pursue prosecution against the former FBI director. Nonetheless, the DOJ inspector general found that Comey\u2019s actions \u201cset a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees\u2014and the many thousands more former FBI employees\u2014who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information.\u201d The Justice Department\u2019s office of the inspector general has released its report on whether Jim Comey, the former FBI director, violated department policies by sharing memos on his interactions with Trump. The report notes that the department declined to pursue prosecution against Comey, as has been reported. But it concludes: \u201cComey\u2019s retention, handling, and dissemination of certain Memos violated Department and FBI policies, and his FBI Employment Agreement.\u201d Today marks a rare occasion for Washington in the Trump era. All three of the country\u2019s major newspapers \u2013 the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal \u2013 have front pages lacking the president\u2019s name. This might surprise the president, who spent yesterday tweeting his ire about Puerto Rico as it prepared for a hurricane and denying claims he has promised pardons to aides if they break the law to get his border wall built. But a New York Times reporter warned that Trump will likely take note of his name\u2019s absence and act to change it for tomorrow\u2019s editions. The Trump administration is expected to announce today that it will loosen regulations on the powerful greenhouse gas methane. The Wall Street Journal reports: The proposed plan would do away with Obama-era requirements for the industry to install technologies that monitor and limit leaks from new wells, tanks and pipeline networks and to more frequently inspect for leaks. It would also forestall legal requirements that would have forced the EPA to set rules on emissions from thousands of pre-existing wells and industry sites. Some companies have asked for the rollback, while others, including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, have warned the Trump administration that a lack of government-backed minimum requirements to curb emissions could undermine the argument that natural gas is a cleaner fuel. They also say legal wrangling could lead to years of uncertainty before deregulation would lower costs. MSNBC announced that several presidential candidates have signed on for the network\u2019s climate change forum, which will be held on Sept. 19 and 20. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are among the Democratic presidential contenders who have said they will participate, but other top-polling candidates appear to have declined the invitation. Republican presidential candidate Bill Weld, who has launched a long-shot primary challenge to Trump, will also be present. The forum, which will be hosted by Chris Hayes and Ali Velshi at Georgetown University, is in addition to a seven-hour climate town hall that CNN has planned for next week. But climate activists are still complaining about the Democratic National Committee\u2019s refusal to hold a climate-specific debate. The stage is set for the next Democratic debate, and the list of participants is noteworthy for who it does not include. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is, of course, among those who did not make the cut. The New York Democrat ended her presidential bid yesterday after failing to hit the polling or donor threshold for the next debate. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer will also not get the chance to spar with his competitors in Houston next month. Despite spending $16 million since entering the race last month, Steyer fell one poll short of qualifying. But he will likely qualify for the next debate, given that candidates have more time to hit the requirements. With Gillibrand dropping out and Steyer\u2019s $16 million gambit not paying off, the pressure will now be on other lower-polling candidates to drop out. Happy Thursday, live blog readers! Donald Trump\u2019s former defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has found himself in a very threatening position for the president: on a book tour. Trump has previously been burned by former aides publishing tell-all books about their time with the president. But if Mattis\u2019 newly published interview with the Atlantic is any indication, Trump doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about. The magazine\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg repeatedly pressed the Marine general on how he would handle questions about Trump during events for \u201cCall Sign Chaos.\u201d While Mattis acknowledges some areas of disagreement with Trump in the book, he shies away from making any sweeping judgments about the president\u2019s leadership. In the interview, Mattis invoked the French concept of devoir de r\u00e9serve. \u201cThe duty of silence. If you leave an administration, you owe some silence. When you leave an administration over clear policy differences, you need to give the people who are still there as much opportunity as possible to defend the country. They still have the responsibility of protecting this great big experiment of ours.\u201d He added: \u201cI know the malevolence some people feel for this country, and we have to give the people who are protecting us some time to carry out their duties without me adding my criticism to the cacophony that is right now so poisonous.\u201d In short: Don\u2019t hold your breath about any groundbreaking revelations in his new book or on his tour. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will attend a ceremony for the establishment of the US Space Command at 4 pm E.T. Mike Pence will also attend and deliver remarks. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will hold a community town hall on public housing tonight. Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are both campaigning in South Carolina. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",
